    "text": "A Singapore passport is a &lt;a href=\"travel%20document\"&gt;travel document&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"passport\"&gt;passport&lt;/a&gt; issued to citizens and nationals of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;Republic of Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. It enables the bearer to exit and re-enter Singapore freely; travel to and from other countries in accordance with &lt;a href=\"Visa%20requirements%20for%20Singaporean%20citizens\"&gt;visa requirements&lt;/a&gt;, and secure &lt;a href=\"Consular%20assistance\"&gt;assistance from Singapore consular officials&lt;/a&gt; abroad, if necessary.\nAll Singapore passports are issued exclusively by the &lt;a href=\"Immigration%20and%20Checkpoints%20Authority\"&gt;Immigration and Checkpoints Authority&lt;/a&gt; (ICA) on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Home%20Affairs%20%28Singapore%29\"&gt;Ministry of Home Affairs&lt;/a&gt;. Only &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20nationality%20law\"&gt;Singapore citizen&lt;/a&gt;s can apply for this passport. The passport is valid for ten years. As of 2018, the Singapore passport was the most powerful passport in the world with visa-free or visa on arrival access to 190 countries and territories, in conjunction with the passport of Japan in 2018.\nThe Singapore passport is a popular target for counterfeiters due to the relatively liberal visa requirements for Singaporeans and the tendency for immigration officials to clear Singapore passport holders more quickly. The &lt;a href=\"Immigration%20and%20Checkpoints%20Authority\"&gt;Immigration and Checkpoints Authority&lt;/a&gt; has thus adopted several measures to foil forgers, including adding digital photos and special ink since October 1999, and converting to a &lt;a href=\"biometric%20passport\"&gt;biometric passport&lt;/a&gt; from August 2006.\nHistory.\nThe first version of the modern Singapore passport was introduced on 20 June 1966, replacing the Singapore Provisional Passport issued from 17 August 1965. Between 1963 and 1965, &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20passport\"&gt;Malaysian passport&lt;/a&gt;s were issued to residents of Singapore &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20in%20Malaysia\"&gt;when it formed part of Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Citizen%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20and%20Colonies\"&gt;CUKC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"British%20passport\"&gt;British passport&lt;/a&gt;s were issued prior to 1963. The &lt;a href=\"Straits%20Settlements\"&gt;Straits Settlements&lt;/a&gt;, of which Singapore was its capital from 1832 until 1946, also issued its own passports prior to World War II.\nSingapore Restricted Passport (blue cover).\nBetween 1967 and 1999, Singapore also issued a Restricted Passport with a blue cover mainly for travel to &lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20Malaysia\"&gt;West Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. The Restricted Passport was conceived due to the fact that many Singaporeans would regularly travel to West Malaysia for business and leisure purposes. The Restricted Passport ceased to be issued after 1999 due to a lack of demand and the red Singapore Passport was deemed to the be only valid travel document for overseas travel by Singaporean citizens from 1 January 2000.\nValidity.\nThe Singaporean passport is valid for a period of five years for passports issued since 1 April 2005 and ten years for passports issued before said date. Before &lt;a href=\"biometric%20passport\"&gt;biometric passport&lt;/a&gt;s were issued on 15 August 2006, passports for male citizens between 11 and 18 were only valid for two years, and had to be renewed or replaced every two years. Biometric passports cannot be modified due to the \"write once\" policy by &lt;a href=\"ICAO\"&gt;ICAO&lt;/a&gt;. A new passport is valid for a total period of five years. For the renewal of a passport that has a validity of nine months or less, the new one will have a validity of five years plus the remaining validity in the old passport. However, if a passport is being renewed with a validity of more than nine months, it will be valid for five years and nine months. To travel overseas, a passport must be valid for at least six months.\nNew passports issued on or after 1 October 2021 for people aged 16 or above will again have a validity of 10 years, with the government citing improved confidence in the security of biometric passports.\nBiometric passport.\nSince 15 August 2006, all newly issued Singaporean passports contain &lt;a href=\"Biometric%20passport\"&gt;biometric&lt;/a&gt; features (BioPass). A major reason for this addition is to comply with the requirements for the US &lt;a href=\"Visa%20Waiver%20Program\"&gt;Visa Waiver Program&lt;/a&gt;. The features also help to prevent forgery and minimise the abuse of Singaporean passports. The biometric passports contain 64 pages, unlike the &lt;a href=\"machine%20readable%20passport\"&gt;machine readable passport&lt;/a&gt;s, which contain 96 pages. It costs &lt;a href=\"Singaporean%20Dollar\"&gt;S$&lt;/a&gt;70 for a passport. One can apply for the passport on the Internet, by &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; or by deposit box with applicants having to collect the passport personally. However, if the application is made in person at a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20diplomatic%20missions%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;Singaporean overseas mission&lt;/a&gt;, it will cost S$80 in foreign currency equivalent.\nThe biometric passport is valid for 5 years for first time applicants, compared with 10 years for previously issued passports without biometric features. Also, the new passport does not accept modifications such as extensions of validity, and updating of photographs due to &lt;a href=\"ICAO\"&gt;ICAO&lt;/a&gt;'s \"write once\" policy. In a break from long standing practice, the passport number is now unique to each passport, instead of being identical to the holder's &lt;a href=\"National%20Registration%20Identity%20Card\"&gt;NRIC&lt;/a&gt; number. Children are no longer allowed to travel on their parents' passports. The biometric passport project cost the Singaporean government a total of S$9.7\u00a0million.\nA new Singapore biometric passport design was introduced on 26 October 2017. It features a redesigned front cover as well as several new security features such as a Multiple Laser Image (MLI) in the shape of &lt;a href=\"Pulau%20Ujong\"&gt;Singapore Island&lt;/a&gt; and a window lock of the image of the passport holder which can be viewed as a positive or negative image when tilted and viewed under a light source. New visa page designs, featuring the &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Botanic%20Gardens\"&gt;Singapore Botanic Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esplanade%20%E2%80%93%20Theatres%20on%20the%20Bay\"&gt;Esplanade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marina%20Barrage\"&gt;Marina Barrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gardens%20by%20the%20Bay\"&gt;Gardens by the Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Sports%20Hub\"&gt;Singapore Sports Hub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Punggol\"&gt;Punggol&lt;/a&gt; New Town were also introduced in the new biometric passport, replacing the previous &lt;a href=\"Central%20Area%2C%20Singapore\"&gt;Central Business District&lt;/a&gt; and Esplanade visa page designs.\nPhysical appearance.\nFront cover.\nSingaporean passports are bright red in colour, with the words \"REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE\" inscribed at the top of the front cover, and the &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;coat of arms of Singapore&lt;/a&gt; emblazoned in the centre of the front cover. The motto and the title of the national anthem of Singapore, &lt;a href=\"Majulah%20Singapura\"&gt;Majulah Singapura&lt;/a&gt;, is inscribed on the scroll of the coat of arms, whilst the word \"PASSPORT\" is inscribed below. The &lt;a href=\"biometric%20passport\"&gt;biometric passport&lt;/a&gt; symbol appears at the bottom of the front cover under the word \"PASSPORT\".\nPassport note.\nThe passport contains a note from the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;President of Singapore&lt;/a&gt; addressing the authorities of all territories:\nInformation page.\nSingaporean passports include the following data on the plastic information page:\nThe information page ends with the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20Readable%20Zone\"&gt;Machine Readable Zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiometric chip.\nThe embedded chip stores the owner's digitised photograph, name, sex, date of birth, nationality, passport number, and the passport expiry date. This is the same information that appears on the printed information page of every passport. &lt;a href=\"Facial%20recognition%20system\"&gt;Facial recognition technology&lt;/a&gt; was introduced with the release of the &lt;a href=\"Biometric%20passport\"&gt;ePassport&lt;/a&gt; to improve identity verification and reduce &lt;a href=\"Identity%20theft\"&gt;identity-related fraud&lt;/a&gt;. Iris imaging was later added to complement the biometric fingerprint.\nVisa requirements.\nVisa requirements for Singaporean citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states which are placed on citizens of Singapore. As of 22 January 2022, &lt;a href=\"Singaporean%20nationality%20law\"&gt;Singaporean citizens&lt;/a&gt; had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 192 countries and territories, ranking the Singapore passport the most powerful in the world and in Asia (tied with the Japanese passport) in terms of travel freedom, according to the &lt;a href=\"Henley%20Passport%20Index\"&gt;Henley Passport Index&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of January 2022, the passports of Singapore, Brunei, Japan and San Marino are the only ones to allow either visa-free entry or &lt;a href=\"Electronic%20Travel%20Authorisation\"&gt;Electronic Travel Authorisation&lt;/a&gt; to the world's four largest economies, namely China, India, the European Union and the United States. Singapore is also currently the only &lt;a href=\"developed%20country\"&gt;developed country&lt;/a&gt; in the world whose citizens can enter Cuba &lt;a href=\"Visa%20policy%20of%20Cuba\"&gt;without a tourist card or a pre-arranged visa&lt;/a&gt;, as of .\nDual citizenship.\nDual citizenship is strictly prohibited by the Singapore government. A dual citizen may have acquired citizenship by birth in a foreign country, by descent from a foreign citizen parent, or by registration. Singapore citizens who voluntarily and intentionally acquire citizenship of a foreign country after the age of 18 may be deprived of their Singapore citizenship by the Government. Foreigners who naturalise as Singaporean citizens are required to renounce all foreign citizenships. Persons who are born outside of Singapore and have at least one parent who is a Singapore citizen may register with a Singapore consulate within a year to acquire Singapore citizenship by descent. However, such persons who acquire foreign citizenship (by birth in a \"&lt;a href=\"jus%20soli\"&gt;jus soli&lt;/a&gt;\" country or naturalisation in another country at an early age) must choose one citizenship before reaching 22 years of age.\nSingapore passports issued to dual citizens have their maximum validity capped at up to their 22nd birthday. They can be renewed for the usual 5 year validity free of cost after renunciation of foreign citizenship and completion of the Oath of Renunciation, Allegiance and Loyalty (ORAL) before reaching 22 years of age. \nNational Service issues.\nAll male citizens are required to be conscripted for two years as &lt;a href=\"National%20service%20in%20Singapore\"&gt;National Service&lt;/a&gt; (NS). Previously, the Singapore government had a policy of limiting the validity of the passport for boys aged 11 and above. Before travel, they had to apply for a 9-month extension of their passports. Such extensions were added with a rubber stamp. The Singapore government has stated that the objective of such exit control measures is to deter NS-evasion, and that these measures serve as a \"psychological reminder\" of the citizen's NS obligations.\nSince the new biometric passport does not permit such modifications, a decision was made by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Singapore%29\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; to do away with limited-validity passports. Exit permits are still required for overseas trips which last longer than three months."
