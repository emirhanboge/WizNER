    "text": "William Alphonsus \"Wee Willie\" Crilley (29 August 1901 \u2013 16 September 1955) was a Scottish-American &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Striker%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt; who holds the record for the greatest number of goals scored by an Alloa Athletic player in a single season of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish Football League&lt;/a&gt;. He had an itinerant career, spending most of it in the United States with a few seasons, or parts of seasons in Scotland.\nCareer.\nDuring his youth, Crilley played for Pale Ale, a local Glasgow amateur team. In 1920, he began the season with &lt;a href=\"Cambuslang%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Cambuslang Rangers&lt;/a&gt;. During the season, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Alloa%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Alloa Athletic&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish Football League&lt;/a&gt; Second Division. In his first season with Alloa, he scored the game winners in Alloa's first and second round victories in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt;. He also scored in the third round replay with &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, a 4\u20131 loss for Alloa. Despite the loss in the Scottish Cup, Alloa won the 1921 Penman Trophy and Stirlingshire Cup. The next year, Crilley carried Alloa to the Second Division championship as he scored a record forty-nine goals, an amazing feat for a five-foot three center forward. Alloa transferred Crilley to &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the season, but he played only three first team games, scoring a single goal. Celtic sent him back to Alloa at the end of the season, but injuries hindered his playing time.\nHe then left Scotland to sign with &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Field%20Club\"&gt;New York Field Club&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Soccer%20League%20%281921-1933%29\"&gt;American Soccer League&lt;/a&gt; which had not yet finished its season. He played five games, scoring five goals. Crilley began the 1923\u20131924 season in New York, played two league games, one &lt;a href=\"National%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;National Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; game before being transferred to the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;. He played two games, scoring one goal, then returned to Scotland to rejoin Alloa. According to the Alloa history, he was \"transferred down south for \u00a31,250\" but it does not identify Crilley's new team. However, at some point he returned to the United States where he played eleven games of the 1924\u20131925 season with &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Flooring\"&gt;Indiana Flooring&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrilley returned to the Giants for the 1925\u20131926 season, seeing his greatest number of games during any stint with a US team, twenty-eight. By this time, he was no longer a center forward and had become better known as a top winger and an excellent play maker. Crilley resumed his nomadic career during the 1926\u20131927 season, bouncing between three teams during the course of the season. He began with the Giants, played nine games for &lt;a href=\"J%26amp%3BP%20Coats\"&gt;J&amp;P Coats&lt;/a&gt; and finished with two games at &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Field%20Club\"&gt;Philadelphia Field Club&lt;/a&gt;. He then played for the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Nationals%20%28ASL%29\"&gt;New York Nationals&lt;/a&gt; in 1927\u20131928. In the 1928\u20131929 season, he was with &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Hispano\"&gt;Brooklyn Hispano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Hungaria\"&gt;New York Hungaria&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"IRT%20Rangers\"&gt;IRT Rangers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Professional%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;Eastern Professional Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe apparently returned to Scotland intending to play for Alloa Athletic, but was deported from Scotland because he had become a US citizen. Therefore, he was back into the ASL in the fall of 1930 with the &lt;a href=\"Newark%20Americans\"&gt;Newark Americans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Soccer%20Club\"&gt;New York Soccer Club&lt;/a&gt;. While he played only one league game with New York SC, he saw another five cup games in which he scored seven goals. He continued his itinerant ways in 1931, playing for both the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20River%20F.C.\"&gt;Fall River F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Wanderers\"&gt;Brooklyn Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; before joining the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Americans%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;New York American&lt;/a&gt; in the fall of 1931. Crilley replicated his early career goal scoring heroics for these last two teams, scoring 14 goals in 7 games for Brooklyn and 9 goals in 10 games for the Americans. In 1932, he attempted to rejoin &lt;a href=\"Alloa%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Alloa Athletic&lt;/a&gt;, but was rebuffed. In 1935, he played for &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Hispano\"&gt;Brooklyn Hispano&lt;/a&gt; in the second American Soccer League.\nHe returned to the United States and joined the &lt;a href=\"US%20Army\"&gt;US Army&lt;/a&gt; on 18 November 1942, serving in the Air Corps with &lt;a href=\"Fifteenth%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Fifteenth Air Force&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;."
