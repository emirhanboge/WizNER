    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, the Cauchy integral theorem (also known as the Cauchy\u2013Goursat theorem) in &lt;a href=\"complex%20analysis\"&gt;complex analysis&lt;/a&gt;, named after &lt;a href=\"Augustin-Louis%20Cauchy\"&gt;Augustin-Louis Cauchy&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"%C3%89douard%20Goursat\"&gt;\u00c9douard Goursat&lt;/a&gt;), is an important statement about &lt;a href=\"line%20integral\"&gt;line integral&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"holomorphic%20function\"&gt;holomorphic function&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"complex%20number\"&gt;complex plane&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, it says that if formula_1 is analytic in a simply connected domain \u03a9, then for any simply closed contour formula_2 in \u03a9, that contour integral is zero. \nformula_3\nStatement.\nFundamental theorem for complex line integrals.\nIf is a holomorphic function on an open region , and formula_4 is a curve in from formula_5 to formula_6 then,\nformula_7\nAlso, when has an single-valued antiderivative in an open region , then the path integral formula_8 is path independent for all paths in .\nFormulation on Simply Connected Regions.\nLet formula_9 be a &lt;a href=\"Simply%20connected%20space\"&gt;simply connected&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"open%20subset\"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; set, and let formula_10 be a &lt;a href=\"holomorphic%20function\"&gt;holomorphic function&lt;/a&gt;. Let formula_11 be a smooth closed curve. Then:\nformula_12\nGeneral Formulation.\nLet formula_9 be an &lt;a href=\"open%20subset\"&gt;open set&lt;/a&gt;, and let formula_10 be a &lt;a href=\"holomorphic%20function\"&gt;holomorphic function&lt;/a&gt;. Let formula_11 be a smooth closed curve. If formula_4 is &lt;a href=\"Homotopy\"&gt;homotopic&lt;/a&gt; to a constant curve, then:\nformula_12\n(Recall that a curve is &lt;a href=\"Homotopy\"&gt;homotopic&lt;/a&gt; to a constant curve if there exists a smooth &lt;a href=\"homotopy\"&gt;homotopy&lt;/a&gt; from the curve to the constant curve. Intuitively, this means that one can shrink the curve into a point without exiting the space.) The first version is a special case of this because on a &lt;a href=\"Simply%20connected%20space\"&gt;simply connected&lt;/a&gt; set, every closed curve is &lt;a href=\"Homotopy\"&gt;homotopic&lt;/a&gt; to a constant curve. \nMain Example.\nIn both cases, it is important to remember that the curve formula_4 not surround any \"holes\" in the domain, or else the theorem does not apply. A famous example is the following curve: \nformula_22\nwhich traces out the unit circle. Here the following integral:\nformula_23\nis nonzero. The Cauchy integral theorem does not apply here since formula_24 is not defined at formula_25. Intuitively, formula_4 surrounds a \"hole\" in the domain of formula_27, so formula_4 cannot be shrunk to a point without exiting the space. Thus, the theorem does not apply.\nDiscussion.\nAs &lt;a href=\"%C3%89douard%20Goursat\"&gt;\u00c9douard Goursat&lt;/a&gt; showed, Cauchy's integral theorem can be proven assuming only that the complex derivative formula_29 exists everywhere in formula_13. This is significant because one can then prove &lt;a href=\"Cauchy%27s%20integral%20formula\"&gt;Cauchy's integral formula&lt;/a&gt; for these functions, and from that deduce these functions are &lt;a href=\"infinitely%20differentiable\"&gt;infinitely differentiable&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe condition that formula_13 be &lt;a href=\"simply%20connected\"&gt;simply connected&lt;/a&gt; means that formula_13 has no \"holes\" or, in &lt;a href=\"homotopy\"&gt;homotopy&lt;/a&gt; terms, that the &lt;a href=\"fundamental%20group\"&gt;fundamental group&lt;/a&gt; of formula_13 is trivial; for instance, every open disk formula_34, for formula_35, qualifies. The condition is crucial; consider\nformula_36\nwhich traces out the unit circle, and then the path integral\nformula_37\nis nonzero; the Cauchy integral theorem does not apply here since formula_24 is not defined (and is certainly not holomorphic) at formula_25.\nOne important consequence of the theorem is that path integrals of holomorphic functions on simply connected domains can be computed in a manner familiar from the &lt;a href=\"fundamental%20theorem%20of%20calculus\"&gt;fundamental theorem of calculus&lt;/a&gt;: let formula_13 be a &lt;a href=\"simply%20connected\"&gt;simply connected&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"open%20subset\"&gt;open subset&lt;/a&gt; of formula_41, let formula_10 be a holomorphic function, and let formula_4 be a &lt;a href=\"piecewise%20continuously%20differentiable%20path\"&gt;piecewise continuously differentiable path&lt;/a&gt; in formula_13 with start point formula_45 and end point formula_46. If formula_47 is a &lt;a href=\"complex%20antiderivative\"&gt;complex antiderivative&lt;/a&gt; of formula_27, then\nformula_49\nThe Cauchy integral theorem is valid with a weaker hypothesis than given above, e.g. given formula_13\",\" a simply connected open subset of formula_41, we can weaken the assumptions to formula_27 being holomorphic on formula_13 and continuous on &lt;a href=\"closure%20%28topology%29\"&gt;formula_54&lt;/a&gt; and formula_4 a rectifiable simple loop in formula_54.\nThe Cauchy integral theorem leads to &lt;a href=\"Cauchy%27s%20integral%20formula\"&gt;Cauchy's integral formula&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"residue%20theorem\"&gt;residue theorem&lt;/a&gt;.\nProof.\nIf one assumes that the partial derivatives of a holomorphic function are continuous, the Cauchy integral theorem can be proved as a direct consequence of &lt;a href=\"Green%27s%20theorem\"&gt;Green's theorem&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that the real and imaginary parts of formula_57 must satisfy the &lt;a href=\"Cauchy%E2%80%93Riemann%20equations\"&gt;Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations&lt;/a&gt; in the region bounded by and moreover in the open neighborhood of this region. Cauchy provided this proof, but it was later proved by Goursat without requiring techniques from vector calculus, or the continuity of partial derivatives.\nWe can break the integrand as well as the differential formula_58 into their real and imaginary components:\nformula_59\nformula_60\nIn this case we have\nformula_61\nBy &lt;a href=\"Green%27s%20theorem\"&gt;Green's theorem&lt;/a&gt;, we may then replace the integrals around the closed contour formula_4 with an area integral throughout the domain formula_63 that is enclosed by formula_4 as follows:\nformula_65\nformula_66\nBut as the real and imaginary parts of a function holomorphic in the domain formula_67 and formula_68 must satisfy the &lt;a href=\"Cauchy%E2%80%93Riemann%20equations\"&gt;Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations&lt;/a&gt; there:\nformula_69\nformula_70\nWe therefore find that both integrands (and hence their integrals) are zero\nformula_71\nformula_72\nThis gives the desired result\nformula_73\nPolitical significance.\nThe German mathematician &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Bieberbach\"&gt;Ludwig Bieberbach&lt;/a&gt; disparaged this theorem, claiming it was representative of an abstract style of reasoning that was characteristic of Jews and speakers of Romance languages, but foreign to Germans. Bieberbach founded the Nazi-linked &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Mathematik\"&gt;Deutsche Mathematik&lt;/a&gt; movement that sought to purge German mathematics of these influences. In a series of lectures he opined that \u201cThe Cauchy-Goursat theorem arouses intolerable displeasure in us Germans. But certainly not in a &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Landau\"&gt;Landau&lt;/a&gt;. Such a thing is mentally determined. \u2026 All in all, such juggling with concepts and a pronounced shrewdness characterize the nonorganic, hostile S type, especially Jewish mathematics.\u201d "
