    "text": "The ocellated turkey (\"Meleagris ocellata\") is a species of &lt;a href=\"turkey%20%28bird%29\"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt; residing primarily in the &lt;a href=\"Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula\"&gt;Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in parts of &lt;a href=\"Belize\"&gt;Belize&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;. A relative of the North American &lt;a href=\"wild%20turkey\"&gt;wild turkey&lt;/a&gt; (\"Meleagris gallopavo\"), it was sometimes previously considered in a genus of its own (\"Agriocharis\"), but the differences between the two turkeys are currently considered too small to justify generic segregation. It is a relatively large &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;, at around long and an average weight of in females and in males.\nThe ocellated turkey lives only in a range in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which includes all or part the states of &lt;a href=\"Quintana%20Roo\"&gt;Quintana Roo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Campeche\"&gt;Campeche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yucat%C3%A1n%20%28state%29\"&gt;Yucat\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tabasco\"&gt;Tabasco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chiapas\"&gt;Chiapas&lt;/a&gt;\u2014as well as the northern and western parts of &lt;a href=\"Belize\"&gt;Belize&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ocellated turkey was considered endangered by Mexican authorities as recently as 2002 and has been considered Near Threatened by the IUCN since 2009 (Kampichler et al. 2010). The species is believed to have experienced a decline in response to land use changes and higher than sustainable harvest by migrant workers and subsistence hunters living in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula region of Central America. (Kampichler et al. 2010). A study conducted in the year 2011 indicated that the ocellated turkey made up a substantial amount of the diets of four prominent ethnic groups of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula (Santos et al. 2012).\nDescription.\nThe body feathers of both sexes are a mixture of bronze and green &lt;a href=\"Iridescence\"&gt;iridescent&lt;/a&gt; color. Although females can be duller with more green, the breast feathers do not generally differ and cannot be used to determine sex. Neither sex possesses the \"beard\" typically found in wild turkeys. Tail feathers of both sexes are bluish-grey with an eye-shaped, blue-bronze spot near the end with a bright gold tip. The spots, or \"ocelli\" (located on the tail), for which the ocellated turkey is named, have been likened to the patterning typically found on peafowl. The upper, major secondary wing &lt;a href=\"covert%20%28feather%29\"&gt;covert&lt;/a&gt;s are rich iridescent copper. The primary and secondary wing feathers have similar barring to that of North American turkeys, but the secondaries have more white, especially around the edges.\nBoth sexes have blue heads with some orange or red &lt;a href=\"Nodule%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;nodules&lt;/a&gt;, which are more pronounced on males. The males also have a fleshy blue crown covered with nodules, similar to those on the neck, behind the &lt;a href=\"Comb%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;snood&lt;/a&gt;. During breeding season this crown swells up and becomes brighter and more pronounced in its yellow-orange color. The eye is surrounded by a ring of bright red skin, which is most visible on males during breeding season. The legs are deep red and are shorter and thinner than on North American turkeys. Males over one year old have spurs on the legs that average , with lengths of over being recorded. These spurs are much longer and thinner than on North American turkeys.\nOcellated turkeys are much smaller than any of the subspecies of North American wild turkey, with adult hens weighing about before laying eggs and 3\u00a0kg (6\u20137 pounds) the rest of the year, and adult males weighing about during breeding season.\nBehavior.\nTurkeys spend most of the time on the ground and often prefer to run to escape danger through the day rather than fly, though they can fly swiftly and powerfully for short distances as the majority of birds in this order do when necessary. Roosting is usually high in trees away from night-hunting predators, such as &lt;a href=\"jaguar\"&gt;jaguar&lt;/a&gt;s, and usually in a family group.\nThe ocellated turkey is a generalist in terms of its feeding habits. They are known to feed on a wide variety of forage including but not limited to insects, such as beetles, moths, and leafcutter ants, grass seeds, nuts, and leaves (Sugihara and Heston 1981). The feeding rates of male ocellated turkeys have been observed to be significantly higher during January before the breeding season begins than when the breeding season is in full swing (Sugihara and Heston 1981). Prior to the breeding season, adult male turkeys have been observed in flocks usually no larger than three mature birds, whereas flocks of eight or more birds consisted of yearling turkeys and hens (Sugihara and Heston 1981).\nThe breeding season for the ocellated turkey begins in early February when the first gobbles are heard. The breeding season peaks in March and comes to an end by the end of April. Male ocellated turkeys engage in an elaborate, spirited display to attract females (Gonzalez et al. 1998). Ocellated turkeys use their tail fans just like North American subspecies of turkeys do; however, there are several distinct differences between the display of the ocellated and their North American cousins. Male turkeys begin the mating dance by tapping their feet against the ground in rapid succession. Next, the male birds move their tail feathers from side to side while quickly vibrating their wings and dragging the tips of them against the ground. As the male does this dance, he moves around the female making sure the dorsal surface of the tail feathers are constantly in view of the female (Gonzalez et al. 1998). Ocellated turkey poults hatch in May through July after a 28-day incubation period. Female ocellated turkeys lay 8\u201315 eggs in a well concealed nest on the ground. The poults are covered in a reddish brown juvenile plumage which allows them to blend into their surroundings to hide from predators. The young are &lt;a href=\"precocial\"&gt;precocial&lt;/a&gt; and able to leave the nest after one night. They then follow their mother until they reach young adulthood when they begin to range though often re-grouping to roost.\nVocalizations of the hen ocellated turkeys are similar to those of their northern relatives, however the male vocalization known as a \u201cgobble\u201d is quite different in comparison. The gobble begins with several low frequency \"thumps\", much like the sound of a small gasoline motor starting. As the tempo of thumps increases, the typical gobble is produced\" (Gonzalez et al. 1998). Branton and Berryhill (2007) have observed that the male ocellated turkey does not gobble \"per se\" like the wild turkey. Rather, his song is distinct and includes some six to seven bongo-like bass tones which quicken in both cadence and volume until a crescendo is reached whereupon the bird's head is fully erect while he issues forth a rather high-pitched but melodious series of chops. The ocellated turkey will typically begin his singing 20 to 25 minutes before sunrise\u2014similar to the wild turkey."
