    "text": "Sir Thomas North (28 May 1535c.\u00a01604) was an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; translator, military officer, lawyer, and justice of the peace. His translation into English of &lt;a href=\"Plutarch\"&gt;Plutarch&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Parallel%20Lives\"&gt;Parallel Lives&lt;/a&gt;\" is notable for being the main source text used by &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt; for his Roman plays.\nLife.\nThomas North was born between 9 and 10 o'clock at night on Friday, 28 May 1535, in the parish of &lt;a href=\"St%20Alban%2C%20Wood%20Street\"&gt;St Alban, Wood Street&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt;. He was the second son of the &lt;a href=\"Edward%20North%2C%201st%20Baron%20North\"&gt;Edward North, 1st Baron North&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is supposed to have been a student of &lt;a href=\"Peterhouse%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Peterhouse, Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, and was entered at &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Lincoln's Inn&lt;/a&gt; in 1557. In 1574 he accompanied his brother, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20North%2C%202nd%20Baron%20North\"&gt;Lord North&lt;/a&gt;, on a diplomatic mission to the French court in Lyon. He served as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28land%20and%20air%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; of a band of footmen in Ireland in 1580, was appointed to defend the Isle of Ely in the year of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Armada\"&gt;Armada&lt;/a&gt;, and was &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;ed about three years later. He returned again to Ireland in 1596.\nHis name is on the roll of &lt;a href=\"justice%20of%20the%20peace\"&gt;justices of the peace&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; in 1592 and again in 1597. He was presented with a reward of \u00a325 for his part in putting down &lt;a href=\"Essex%27s%20Rebellion\"&gt;Essex's Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in 1601, and received a small pension (\u00a340 a year) from &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; that same year.\nTranslations.\nGuevara.\nHe translated, in 1557, &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20de%20Guevara\"&gt;Guevara&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Reloj de Principes\" (commonly known as \"Libro \u00e1ureo\"), a compendium of moral counsels chiefly compiled from the \"&lt;a href=\"Meditations\"&gt;Meditations&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Aurelius\"&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt;, under the title of \"Diall of Princes\". The English of this work is one of the earliest specimens of the ornate, copious and pointed style for which educated young Englishmen had acquired a taste in their &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Continental&lt;/a&gt; travels and studies.\nNorth translated from a French copy of Guevara, but seems to have been well acquainted with the Spanish version. The book had already been translated by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Berners\"&gt;Lord Berners&lt;/a&gt;, but without reproducing the rhetorical artifices of the original. North's version, with its mannerisms and its constant use of &lt;a href=\"antithesis\"&gt;antithesis&lt;/a&gt;, set the fashion which was to culminate in &lt;a href=\"John%20Lyly\"&gt;John Lyly&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Euphues%20%281578%29\"&gt;Euphues&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEastern fables.\nHis next work was \"The Morall Philosophie of Doni\" (1570), a translation of an &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; collection of eastern fables, popularly known as \"&lt;a href=\"Panchatantra\"&gt;The Fables of Bidpai&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPlutarch's \"Lives\".\nNorth published his translation of Plutarch in 1580, basing it on the French version by &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Amyot\"&gt;Jacques Amyot&lt;/a&gt;. The first edition was dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;, and was followed by another edition in 1595, containing fresh \"Lives\". A third edition of his Plutarch was published, in 1603, with more translated Parallel Lives, and a supplement of other translated &lt;a href=\"biography\"&gt;biographies&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica%20Eleventh%20Edition\"&gt;Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition&lt;/a&gt;, \"[i]t is almost impossible to overestimate the influence of North's vigorous English on contemporary writers, and some critics have called him the first master of English prose\".\nShakespeare.\nThe \"Lives\" translation formed the source from which &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt; drew the materials for his \"&lt;a href=\"Julius%20Caesar%20%28play%29\"&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Coriolanus\"&gt;Coriolanus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Timon%20of%20Athens\"&gt;Timon of Athens&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Antony%20and%20Cleopatra\"&gt;Antony and Cleopatra&lt;/a&gt;\". It is in the last-named play that he follows the \"Lives\" most closely, whole speeches being taken directly from North.\n\"Tudor Translations\".\nNorth's \"Plutarch\" was reprinted for the \"Tudor Translations\" (1895), with an introduction by &lt;a href=\"George%20Wyndham\"&gt;George Wyndham&lt;/a&gt;."
