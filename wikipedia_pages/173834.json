Robinson (born Emanuel Goldenberg; ; December 12, 1893January 26, 1973) was a &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20American\"&gt;Romanian-born American&lt;/a&gt; actor of stage and screen during &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Hollywood%20cinema\"&gt;Hollywood's Golden Age&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared in 30 Broadway plays and more than 100 films during a 50-year career and is best remembered for his tough-guy roles as gangsters in such films as \"&lt;a href=\"Little%20Caesar%20%28film%29\"&gt;Little Caesar&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Key%20Largo%20%28film%29\"&gt;Key Largo&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, he was an outspoken public critic of &lt;a href=\"fascism\"&gt;fascism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazism\"&gt;Nazism&lt;/a&gt;, which were growing in strength in Europe in the years which led up to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. His activism included contributing over $250,000 to more than 850 organizations which were involved in war relief, along with contributions to cultural, educational and religious groups. During the 1950s, he was called to testify in front of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee\"&gt;House Un-American Activities Committee&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Scare%23Second%20Red%20Scare%20.281947.E2.80.9357.29\"&gt;Red Scare&lt;/a&gt;, but he was cleared of any deliberate &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; involvement when he claimed that he was \"duped\" by several people whom he named (including screenwriter &lt;a href=\"Dalton%20Trumbo\"&gt;Dalton Trumbo&lt;/a&gt;, according to the official Congressional record, \"Communist infiltration of the Hollywood motion-picture industry\"). As a result of being investigated, he found himself on Hollywood\u2019s graylist, people who were on the Hollywood blacklist maintained by the major studios, but could find work at minor film studios on what was called Poverty Row.\nRobinson's roles included an &lt;a href=\"insurance%20investigator\"&gt;insurance investigator&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"film%20noir\"&gt;film noir&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Double%20Indemnity\"&gt;Double Indemnity&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Dathan\"&gt;Dathan&lt;/a&gt; (the adversary of &lt;a href=\"Moses\"&gt;Moses&lt;/a&gt;) in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ten%20Commandments%20%281956%20film%29\"&gt;The Ten Commandments&lt;/a&gt;\", and his final performance in the &lt;a href=\"Science%20fiction\"&gt;science-fiction&lt;/a&gt; story \"&lt;a href=\"Soylent%20Green\"&gt;Soylent Green&lt;/a&gt;\". Robinson received an &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Honorary%20Award\"&gt;Academy Honorary Award&lt;/a&gt; for his work in the film industry, which was awarded two months after he died in 1973. He is ranked number 24 in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Film%20Institute\"&gt;American Film Institute&lt;/a&gt;'s list of the 25 &lt;a href=\"AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Stars\"&gt;greatest male stars of Classic American cinema&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly years and education.\nRobinson's original name was Emanuel Goldenberg.

Robinson arrived in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; on February 21, 1904. \"At &lt;a href=\"Ellis%20Island\"&gt;Ellis Island&lt;/a&gt; I was born again,\" he wrote. \"Life for me began when I was 10 years old.\" He grew up on the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20East%20Side\"&gt;Lower East Side&lt;/a&gt;, and had his &lt;a href=\"Bar%20and%20Bat%20Mitzvah\"&gt;Bar Mitzvah&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"First%20Roumanian-American%20Congregation\"&gt;First Roumanian-American Congregation&lt;/a&gt;.

An interest in acting and performing in front of people led to him winning an &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Arts\"&gt;American Academy of Dramatic Arts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scholarship\"&gt;scholarship&lt;/a&gt;, after which he changed his name to \"Edward G.

DeMille&lt;/a&gt; cast him as the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Dathan\"&gt;Dathan&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ten%20Commandments%20%281956%20film%29\"&gt;The Ten Commandments&lt;/a&gt;\". The film was released in 1956, as was his psychological thriller \"&lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%281956%20film%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAfter a subsequent short absence from the screen, Robinson's film career\u2014augmented by an increasing number of television roles\u2014restarted for good in 1958/59, when he was second-billed after Frank Sinatra in the 1959 release \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Hole%20in%20the%20Head\"&gt;A Hole in the Head&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSupporting actor.\nRobinson went to Europe for \"&lt;a href=\"Seven%20Thieves\"&gt;Seven Thieves&lt;/a&gt;\" (1960).

He also appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Slam%20%281967%20film%29\"&gt;Grand Slam&lt;/a&gt;\" (1967) starring &lt;a href=\"Janet%20Leigh\"&gt;Janet Leigh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Klaus%20Kinski\"&gt;Klaus Kinski&lt;/a&gt;.\nRobinson was originally cast in the role of Dr. Zaius in \"&lt;a href=\"Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%281968%20film%29\"&gt;Planet Of The Apes&lt;/a&gt;\" (1968) and he even went so far as to film a screen test with &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Heston\"&gt;Charlton Heston&lt;/a&gt;. However, Robinson dropped out of the project before its production began due to heart problems and concerns over the long hours which he would have needed to spend under the heavy ape makeup. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Evans%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Maurice Evans&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis later appearances included \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Biggest%20Bundle%20of%20Them%20All\"&gt;The Biggest Bundle of Them All&lt;/a&gt;\" (1968) starring &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Wagner\"&gt;Robert Wagner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raquel%20Welch\"&gt;Raquel Welch&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Never%20a%20Dull%20Moment%20%281968%20film%29\"&gt;Never a Dull Moment&lt;/a&gt;\" (1968) with &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Van%20Dyke\"&gt;Dick Van Dyke&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"It%27s%20Your%20Move%20%281968%20film%29\"&gt;It's Your Move&lt;/a&gt;\" (1968), \"&lt;a href=\"Mackenna%27s%20Gold\"&gt;Mackenna's Gold&lt;/a&gt;\" (1969) starring &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20Peck\"&gt;Gregory Peck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Omar%20Sharif\"&gt;Omar Sharif&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20Gallery\"&gt;Night Gallery&lt;/a&gt;\" episode \u201cThe Messiah on Mott Street\" (1971).\nThe last scene which Robinson filmed was a &lt;a href=\"euthanasia\"&gt;euthanasia&lt;/a&gt; sequence, with his friend and co-star &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Heston\"&gt;Charlton Heston&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"science%20fiction\"&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cult%20following\"&gt;cult film&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Soylent%20Green\"&gt;Soylent Green&lt;/a&gt;\" (1973); he died only twelve days later.\nHeston, as president of the &lt;a href=\"Screen%20Actors%20Guild\"&gt;Screen Actors Guild&lt;/a&gt;, presented Robinson with its annual award in 1969, \"in recognition of his pioneering work in organizing the union, his service during World War II, and his 'outstanding achievement in fostering the finest ideals of the acting profession.'\"\nRobinson was never nominated for an &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award\"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt;, but in 1973 he was awarded an &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Honorary%20Award\"&gt;honorary Oscar&lt;/a&gt; in recognition that he had \"achieved greatness as a player, a patron of the arts and a dedicated citizen ... in sum, a Renaissance man\". He had been notified of the honor, but he died two months before the award ceremony took place, so the award was accepted by his widow, Jane Robinson.\nRadio.\nFrom 1937 to 1942, Robinson starred as Steve Wilson, editor of the \"Illustrated Press\", in the newspaper drama \"&lt;a href=\"Big%20Town\"&gt;Big Town&lt;/a&gt;\". He also portrayed hardboiled detective &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Spade\"&gt;Sam Spade&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"Lux%20Radio%20Theatre\"&gt;Lux Radio Theatre&lt;/a&gt; adaptation of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Maltese%20Falcon%20%28novel%29\"&gt;The Maltese Falcon&lt;/a&gt;\". During the 1940s he also performed on CBS Radio's \"Cadena de las Am\u00e9ricas\" network broadcasts to South America in collaboration with &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20Rockefeller\"&gt;Nelson Rockefeller&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"cultural%20diplomacy\"&gt;cultural diplomacy&lt;/a&gt; program at the U.S. State Department's &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20the%20Coordinator%20of%20Inter-American%20Affairs\"&gt;Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nRobinson was married twice, first to stage actress Gladys Lloyd, born Gladys Lloyd Cassell, in 1927; she was the former wife of Ralph L. Vestervelt and the daughter of Clement C. Cassell, an architect, sculptor and artist. The couple had one son, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20G.%20Robinson%20Jr.\"&gt;Edward G. Robinson, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. Manny Robinson, 1933\u20131974), as well as a daughter from Gladys Robinson's first marriage. In 1956 the couple divorced. In 1958 he married Jane Bodenheimer, a dress designer professionally known as Jane Arden. Thereafter he also maintained a home in &lt;a href=\"Palm%20Springs%2C%20California\"&gt;Palm Springs, California&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn noticeable contrast to many of his onscreen characters, Robinson was a sensitive, soft-spoken and cultured man who spoke seven languages. Remaining a &lt;a href=\"liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;, he attended the 1960 Democratic Convention in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;. He was a passionate art collector, eventually building up a significant private &lt;a href=\"Collection%20%28museum%29\"&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt;. In 1956, however, he was forced to sell his collection to pay for his divorce settlement with Gladys Robinson; his finances had also suffered due to underemployment in the early 1950s.\nDeath.\nRobinson died of &lt;a href=\"bladder%20cancer\"&gt;bladder cancer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Cedars-Sinai%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; on January 26, 1973. Services were held at Temple Israel in Los Angeles where &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Heston\"&gt;Charlton Heston&lt;/a&gt; delivered the eulogy. Over 1,500 friends of Robinson attended with another 500 crowded outside. His body was then flown to New York where it was entombed in a crypt in the family mausoleum at Beth-El Cemetery in Brooklyn. Among his pallbearers were &lt;a href=\"Jack%20L.%20Warner\"&gt;Jack L. Warner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hal%20B.%20Wallis\"&gt;Hal B. Wallis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mervyn%20LeRoy\"&gt;Mervyn LeRoy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Burns\"&gt;George Burns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Jaffe\"&gt;Sam Jaffe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Sinatra\"&gt;Frank Sinatra&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn October 2000, Robinson's image was imprinted on a U.S. postage stamp, its sixth in its Legends of Hollywood series.\nPolitical activism.\nDuring the 1930s, Robinson was an outspoken public critic of &lt;a href=\"fascism\"&gt;fascism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazism\"&gt;Nazism&lt;/a&gt;, and he also donated more than $250,000 to 850 political and charitable organizations between 1939 and 1949. He was host to the \"Committee of 56\" which gathered at his home on December 9, 1938, signing a \"Declaration of Democratic Independence\" which called for a boycott of all German-made products.\nAlthough he attempted to enlist in the military at the outbreak of World War II, he was unable to do so because of his age; instead, the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20War%20Information\"&gt;Office of War Information&lt;/a&gt; appointed him as a Special Representative based in London. From there, taking advantage of his multilingual skills, he delivered radio addresses in over six languages to European countries which had fallen under &lt;a href=\"German-occupied%20Europe\"&gt;Nazi domination&lt;/a&gt;. His talent as a radio speaker in the U.S. had previously been recognized by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Legion\"&gt;American Legion&lt;/a&gt;, which had given him an award for his \"outstanding contribution to &lt;a href=\"Americanism%20%28ideology%29\"&gt;Americanism&lt;/a&gt; through his stirring patriotic appeals\". Robinson was also an active member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee, serving on its executive board in 1944, during which time he became an \"enthusiastic\" campaigner for Roosevelt's &lt;a href=\"1944%20Democratic%20National%20Convention\"&gt;reelection&lt;/a&gt; that same year. During the 1940s Robinson also contributed to the &lt;a href=\"cultural%20diplomacy\"&gt;cultural diplomacy&lt;/a&gt; initiatives of Roosevelt's &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20the%20Coordinator%20of%20Inter-American%20Affairs\"&gt;Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs&lt;/a&gt; in support of &lt;a href=\"Pan-Americanism\"&gt;Pan-Americanism&lt;/a&gt; through his broadcasts to South America on the &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; \"Cadena da las Am\u00e9ricas\" radio network.\nIn early July 1944, less than a month after the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Normandy\"&gt;Invasion of Normandy&lt;/a&gt; by Allied forces, Robinson traveled to Normandy to entertain the troops, becoming the first movie star to go there for the &lt;a href=\"USO\"&gt;USO&lt;/a&gt;. He personally donated $100,000 ($1,500,000 in 2015 dollars) to the USO. After returning to the U.S. he continued his active involvement in the war effort by going to shipyards and defense plants in order to inspire workers, in addition to appearing at rallies in order to help sell &lt;a href=\"war%20bonds\"&gt;war bonds&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Barbarossa\"&gt;Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, while he was not a supporter of &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;Communism&lt;/a&gt;, he appeared at Soviet war relief rallies in order to give moral aid to America's new ally, which he said could join \"together in their hatred of Hitlerism\".\nAfter the war ended, Robinson publicly spoke out in support of &lt;a href=\"Civil%20and%20political%20rights\"&gt;democratic rights&lt;/a&gt; for all Americans, especially in demanding equality for &lt;a href=\"African%20Americans\"&gt;Blacks&lt;/a&gt; in the workplace. He endorsed the &lt;a href=\"Fair%20Employment%20Practices%20Commission\"&gt;Fair Employment Practices Commission&lt;/a&gt;'s call to end workplace discrimination. Black leaders praised him as \"one of the great friends of the Negro and a great advocator of Democracy\". Robinson also campaigned for the civil rights of African-Americans, helping many people to overcome &lt;a href=\"Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;segregation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Racism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the years when Robinson spoke out against fascism and Nazism, he was not a supporter of Communism, but he did not criticize the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; which he saw as an ally against &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt;. However, notes the film historian Steven J. Ross, \"activists who attacked Hitler without simultaneously attacking &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Stalin&lt;/a&gt; were vilified by &lt;a href=\"Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; critics as either Communists, Communist dupes, or, at best, as &lt;a href=\"Naivety\"&gt;naive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; dupes.\" In addition, Robinson learned that 11 out of the more than 850 charities and groups which he had helped over the previous decade were listed as Communist front organizations by the FBI. As a result, he was called to testify in front of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee\"&gt;House Un-American Activities Committee&lt;/a&gt; (HUAC) in 1950 and 1952 and he was also threatened with &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20blacklist\"&gt;blacklisting&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs it appears in the full &lt;a href=\"https%3A//archive.org/stream/communistinfiltr07unit/communistinfiltr07unit_djvu.txt\"&gt;House Un-American Activities Committee transcript&lt;/a&gt; for April 30, 1952, Robinson \"&lt;a href=\"informant\"&gt;named names&lt;/a&gt;\" of Communist sympathizers (&lt;a href=\"Albert%20Maltz\"&gt;Albert Maltz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalton%20Trumbo\"&gt;Dalton Trumbo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Howard%20Lawson\"&gt;John Howard Lawson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tuttle\"&gt;Frank Tuttle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Buchman\"&gt;Sidney Buchman&lt;/a&gt;) and repudiated some of the organizations which he had belonged to in the 1930s and 1940s. He came to realize, \"I was duped and used.\" His own name was cleared, but in the aftermath, his career noticeably suffered, because he was offered smaller roles and they were offered to him less frequently. In October 1952, he wrote an article which was titled \"How the Reds made a Sucker Out of Me\", and it was published in the \"American Legion Magazine.\" The chair of the committee, &lt;a href=\"Francis%20E.%20Walter\"&gt;Francis E. Walter&lt;/a&gt;, told Robinson at the end of his testimonies, that the Committee \"never had any evidence presented to indicate that you were anything more than a very choice sucker.\"\nIn popular culture.\nRobinson has been the inspiration for a number of animated television characters, usually caricatures of his most distinctive 'snarling gangster' guise. An early version of the gangster character &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20and%20Mugsy\"&gt;Rocky&lt;/a&gt;, featured in the &lt;a href=\"Bugs%20Bunny\"&gt;Bugs Bunny&lt;/a&gt; cartoon \"&lt;a href=\"Racketeer%20Rabbit\"&gt;Racketeer Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;\", shared his likeness. This version of the character also appears briefly in \"&lt;a href=\"Justice%20League%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Justice League&lt;/a&gt;\", in the episode \"Comfort and Joy\", as an alien with Robinson's face and non-human body, who hovers past the screen as a background character.\nSimilar caricatures also appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Coo-Coo%20Nut%20Grove\"&gt;The Coo-Coo Nut Grove&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Thugs%20with%20Dirty%20Mugs\"&gt;Thugs with Dirty Mugs&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Hush%20My%20Mouse\"&gt;Hush My Mouse&lt;/a&gt;\". Another character based on Robinson's tough-guy image was The Frog (Chauncey \"Flat Face\" Frog) from the cartoon series \"&lt;a href=\"Courageous%20Cat%20and%20Minute%20Mouse\"&gt;Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse&lt;/a&gt;\". The voice of B.B. Eyes in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dick%20Tracy%20Show\"&gt;The Dick Tracy Show&lt;/a&gt;\" was based on Robinson, with &lt;a href=\"Mel%20Blanc\"&gt;Mel Blanc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Hausner\"&gt;Jerry Hausner&lt;/a&gt; sharing voicing duties. The \"&lt;a href=\"Wacky%20Races%20%281968%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Wacky Races&lt;/a&gt;\" animated series character 'Clyde' from the Ant Hill Mob was based on Robinson's Little Caesar persona.\nVoice actor &lt;a href=\"Hank%20Azaria\"&gt;Hank Azaria&lt;/a&gt; has noted that the voice of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Simpsons\"&gt;Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;\" character police chief &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Wiggum\"&gt;Clancy Wiggum&lt;/a&gt; is an impression of Robinson. This has been explicitly joked about in episodes of the show. In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Day%20the%20Violence%20Died\"&gt;The Day the Violence Died&lt;/a&gt;\" (1996), a character states that Chief Wiggum is clearly based on Robinson. In 2008's \"&lt;a href=\"Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XIX\"&gt;Treehouse of Horror XIX&lt;/a&gt;\", Wiggum and Robinson's ghost each accuse the other of being rip-offs.\nAnother caricature of Robinson appears in two episodes of \"\" season two, in the person of Lt. Tan Divo. Arok the Hutt was inspired by Edward G. Robinson's gangster portrayals in \nRobinson was played by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Stuhlbarg\"&gt;Michael Stuhlbarg&lt;/a&gt; in the 2015 film \"&lt;a href=\"Trumbo%20%282015%20film%29\"&gt;Trumbo&lt;/a&gt;\". His portrayal as a man who named supposed communists is controversial. "
