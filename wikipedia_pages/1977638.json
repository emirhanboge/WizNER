    "text": "Andr\u00e9 Boisclair (; born April 14, 1966) is a politician in &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. He was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Parti%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois\"&gt;Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"social%20democratic\"&gt;social democratic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quebec%20sovereignty%20movement\"&gt;sovereigntist&lt;/a&gt; party in &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween January 1996 and March 2003, Boisclair served as Citizenship and Immigration Minister and Social Solidarity Minister under former &lt;a href=\"Premier%20of%20Quebec\"&gt;Premier of Quebec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Bouchard\"&gt;Lucien Bouchard&lt;/a&gt; and as Environment Minister under former Premier &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Landry\"&gt;Bernard Landry&lt;/a&gt;. He won the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Parti%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois%20leadership%20election\"&gt;Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leadership election&lt;/a&gt; on November 15, 2005.\nBoisclair announced he was stepping down as leader of the PQ on May 8, 2007. &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Gendron\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Gendron&lt;/a&gt; was named interim leader.\nEarly life.\nBoisclair was born in &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;. He grew up in the affluent francophone Montreal neighbourhood of &lt;a href=\"Outremont%2C%20Quebec\"&gt;Outremont&lt;/a&gt;. While attending &lt;a href=\"Coll%C3%A8ge%20Jean-de-Br%C3%A9beuf\"&gt;Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf&lt;/a&gt;, a private &lt;a href=\"CEGEP\"&gt;CEGEP&lt;/a&gt;, he became the president of the Federation of Quebec College Students (in French, \"&lt;a href=\"FECQ\"&gt;FECQ&lt;/a&gt;\"). After graduation he attended &lt;a href=\"Universit%C3%A9%20de%20Montr%C3%A9al\"&gt;Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al&lt;/a&gt;, but dropped out after two years.\nPolitical scene 1989\u20132003.\nHe joined the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in 1984, and in the &lt;a href=\"1989%20Quebec%20general%20election\"&gt;1989 general election&lt;/a&gt; he was elected to represent the Montreal-area &lt;a href=\"Riding%20%28division%29\"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gouin%20%28electoral%20district%29\"&gt;Gouin&lt;/a&gt; as a PQ candidate. At 23 years old, he became the youngest member ever elected to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20of%20Quebec\"&gt;Quebec National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, a record he held until &lt;a href=\"Simon-Pierre%20Diamond\"&gt;Simon-Pierre Diamond&lt;/a&gt; was elected in 2007. He also quickly garnered a reputation as a party animal in Quebec City's night-life scene.\nHe served as a &lt;a href=\"cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"political%20minister\"&gt;minister&lt;/a&gt; from 1998 to 2003, under Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) Premiers Lucien Bouchard and Bernard Landry, holding a variety of high-profile portfolios. During his time in office, Boisclair and his chief of staff, Luc Doray, became the center of a drug and embezzlement scandal. After a routine audit, officials discovered that Doray submitted over $30,000 in false expense reports and authorities later discovered that Doray had used the money to feed his &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; habit.\nDoray pleaded guilty to defrauding the government and during court testimony it was learned that Boisclair authorized some of the expenses. The ensuing investigation cleared Boisclair of any wrongdoing - he was never accused nor charged with any crime. However, in September 2005, Boisclair admitted to personally using cocaine between 1996 and 2003 while serving as a member of the Quebec legislature.\nBoisclair continued to serve as a Member of the National Assembly until he resigned in August 2004 to attend the &lt;a href=\"Kennedy%20School%20of%20Government\"&gt;John F. Kennedy School of Government&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of his resignation, Boisclair held the position of opposition parliamentary (house) leader. Boisclair completed the Master's in Public Administration program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government - a program that does not require students to hold a previous university degree. While at Harvard, Boisclair attended lectures by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Ignatieff\"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt; and kept a &lt;a href=\"blog\"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; recording his experience.\nParty leadership.\nAfter Bernard Landry resigned in June 2005, Boisclair entered the race to succeed Landry as the PQ's leader. Elected as the sixth leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois on November 15, 2005, Boisclair earned 53.8% of the party membership vote as compared to his closest rival, &lt;a href=\"Pauline%20Marois\"&gt;Pauline Marois&lt;/a&gt;, who garnered 30.6%. For the first time, the PQ allowed telephone voting, resulting in the participation of over 76% of the party membership. Polls taken at the time of his leadership victory in November 2005 suggested that Boisclair's Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois would win a landslide victory over the incumbent &lt;a href=\"Quebec%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; Party of &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Charest\"&gt;Jean Charest&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoisclair was the first &lt;a href=\"Coming%20out\"&gt;openly gay&lt;/a&gt; politician in Canada to win the leadership of a party with legislative representation. (Previous openly gay Canadian political party leaders included &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Lea\"&gt;Chris Lea&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Party%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Green Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Allison%20Brewer\"&gt;Allison Brewer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Brunswick%20New%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;New Brunswick New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;.)\nAfter his election as party leader, Boisclair delivered a speech promising a sovereignty referendum within two years of a PQ victory in the next Quebec general election. During a joint press conference with &lt;a href=\"Bloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois\"&gt;Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Gilles%20Duceppe\"&gt;Gilles Duceppe&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal on November 20, 2005, Boisclair decried Canada's &lt;a href=\"Clarity%20Act\"&gt;Clarity Act&lt;/a&gt; as unacceptable. He stated that if elected Premier, he would ignore the ruling of the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Supreme Court of Canada&lt;/a&gt; on referendum question clarity.\nUpon taking the reins of the PQ, Boisclair's actions quickly created political controversy within his own party. After a questionable appearance in a comedy sketch featuring a homosexual depiction of &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Harper\"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, and an attempt to distance the PQ from its traditional union base, a push to oust Boisclair developed. Purportedly led by Boisclair's predecessor, Bernard Landry (which he denies), the plan failed and no real threat to Boisclair's leadership emerged. Pundits speculated that the proximity of the Quebec general election contributed to the putsch's failure.\nOn August 14, 2006, Boisclair was elected to the provincial legislative assembly in a by-election for the Montreal-area riding of &lt;a href=\"Pointe-aux-Trembles%20%28electoral%20district%29\"&gt;Pointe-aux-Trembles&lt;/a&gt;. He was re-elected in the general election of March 26, 2007.\n2007 election.\nIn February 2007, Boisclair promised a dream team of high-profile candidates for the anticipated &lt;a href=\"2007%20Quebec%20general%20election\"&gt;2007 general election&lt;/a&gt;. Comparing his slate to the \"l'\u00e9quipe du tonnerre\" (the thunder team) of former premier and &lt;a href=\"Quiet%20revolution\"&gt;Quiet revolution&lt;/a&gt; architect &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Lesage\"&gt;Jean Lesage&lt;/a&gt;, Boiscair announced that actor &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Curzi\"&gt;Pierre Curzi&lt;/a&gt;, former cabinet member &lt;a href=\"Linda%20Goupil\"&gt;Linda Goupil&lt;/a&gt;, TV journalist &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Drainville\"&gt;Bernard Drainville&lt;/a&gt;, academic Guy Lachapelle, union leader Marc Laviolette, and former Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MPs &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Marceau\"&gt;Richard Marceau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yvan%20Loubier\"&gt;Yvan Loubier&lt;/a&gt; composed this team. On February 21, 2007, the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, &lt;a href=\"Lise%20Thibault\"&gt;Lise Thibault&lt;/a&gt;, dissolved parliament and called a general election for March 26, 2007.\nBoisclair launched his campaign using the slogan \"Reconstruisons notre Qu\u00e9bec\" (Let's rebuild our Quebec). At the beginning of the campaign, Boisclair's Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois stood five percentage points behind the Quebec Liberals.\nBoisclair stated throughout his campaign that education would remain a key priority in the PQ's election strategy and that he would organize a new referendum on sovereignty as soon as possible. He also supported new measures targeting home ownership for young families.\nDuring the election campaign, controversy arose when radio talk show host &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Champagne\"&gt;Louis Champagne&lt;/a&gt; made &lt;a href=\"Homophobia\"&gt;homophobic&lt;/a&gt; remarks while interviewing Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois candidate &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Cloutier\"&gt;Alexandre Cloutier&lt;/a&gt;, asking him if the fact that his party was led by a gay man \u2014 and was running an openly gay candidate, &lt;a href=\"Sylvain%20Gaudreault\"&gt;Sylvain Gaudreault&lt;/a&gt;, in the neighbouring riding to Cloutier's \u2014 meant that voters would believe the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was \"a club of fags\". Days later, the radio station's corporate owner, the &lt;a href=\"Corus%20Group\"&gt;Corus Group&lt;/a&gt;, suspended Champagne.\nMost observers ruled the 2007 leaders' debate a draw. Critics felt that Boisclair appeared the most aggressive, repeatedly asking the &lt;a href=\"Action%20d%C3%A9mocratique%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec\"&gt;Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec&lt;/a&gt;'s (ADQ) &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Dumont\"&gt;Mario Dumont&lt;/a&gt; to state the financial model of his political platform.\nElection night produced a major disappointment for the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. The party polled its smallest share of the popular vote since 1973 and the PQ came third in seat numbers in the National Assembly - losing Official Opposition status. The 2007 election left Quebec with its first minority government since 1878. Although Boisclair's future as the leader of Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois appeared uncertain, he claimed on the day after the election that he had no plans of stepping down (however, he resigned six weeks later).\nApart from the Champagne incident, the election campaign was not marked by any other open expressions of &lt;a href=\"homophobia\"&gt;homophobia&lt;/a&gt;. However, at least one prominent political journalist in Quebec, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gazette%20%28Montreal%29\"&gt;The Gazette&lt;/a&gt;\"'s &lt;a href=\"Don%20Macpherson%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;Don Macpherson&lt;/a&gt;, has asserted that some other criticism of Boisclair \u2014 particularly a persistent notion among some voters that he was too &lt;a href=\"multicultural\"&gt;cosmopolitan&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montr\u00e9alais&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2014 may in fact have been code for lingering voter discomfort with the idea of electing an openly gay premier.\nResignation as PQ Leader.\nAndr\u00e9 Boisclair announced his resignation as Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader on May 8, 2007, the same day Quebec's National Assembly was resuming sitting after the 2007 general election. The announcement came as a shock to many Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois caucus members, some of whom expressed \"sadness\" at the decision.\nBoisclair's leadership was questioned immediately after the election and petitions for a motion of confidence within the party came far and wide from regional PQ presidents and major sovereigntist groups.\nBoisclair's resignation followed a dispute with Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, the sovereigntist party on the federal scene. In an interview with &lt;a href=\"Radio-Canada\"&gt;Radio-Canada&lt;/a&gt;, Boisclair had confirmed rumours that Duceppe had been scheming for his post. Duceppe denied these rumours but many political observers still believed Boisclair had gone too far in this denunciation.\nBoisclair remained the MNA for Pointe-aux-Trembles, but on October 15, 2007, he announced he was resigning from his seat and quitting politics on November 15, 2007. He also accused leader Bernard Landry of undermining his support as party head by referring to the PQ's loss of public support under Boisclair's reign, and for hinting he wanted to return to the party's leadership himself.\nPost-political life.\nBoisclair was hired by &lt;a href=\"Questerre\"&gt;Questerre&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Calgary\"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt;-based energy company, in 2011 as a consultant due to his sociopolitical knowledge of Quebec. In September 2012, Boisclair criticized the newly elected PQ government's position on the shale (more commonly known as fracking) industry in Quebec.\nIn November 2012, he was named as the new provincial delegate-general in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was the President and CEO for the Urban development institute of Qu\u00e9bec (UDI) - a non-profit organization focused on Quebec's commercial real estate industry from June 2016 until he resigned amidst allegations of sexual assaults.\nOn May 28, 2020, he was charged with two counts of sexual assault on an unidentified victim: one charge for committing a sexual assault while carrying, using or threatening to use a weapon, and one charge for being party to a sexual assault with another person. The events are alleged to have occurred in 2014. The matter has not yet gone to trial."
