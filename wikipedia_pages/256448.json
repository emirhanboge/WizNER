    "text": "The Pasig River () is a &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; that connects &lt;a href=\"Laguna%20de%20Bay\"&gt;Laguna de Bay&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Bay\"&gt;Manila Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Stretching for , it bisects the Philippine capital of &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Manila\"&gt;its surrounding urban area&lt;/a&gt; into northern and southern halves. Its major &lt;a href=\"tributaries\"&gt;tributaries&lt;/a&gt; are the &lt;a href=\"Marikina%20River\"&gt;Marikina River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20River%20%28Metro%20Manila%29\"&gt;San Juan River&lt;/a&gt;. The total &lt;a href=\"drainage%20basin\"&gt;drainage basin&lt;/a&gt; of Pasig River, including the basin of &lt;a href=\"Laguna%20de%20Bay\"&gt;Laguna de Bay&lt;/a&gt;, covers .\nThe Pasig River is technically a &lt;a href=\"tidal%20estuary\"&gt;tidal estuary&lt;/a&gt;, as the flow direction depends upon the water level difference between Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay. During the &lt;a href=\"dry%20season\"&gt;dry season&lt;/a&gt;, the water level in Laguna de Bay is low with the river's flow direction dependent on the tides. During the &lt;a href=\"wet%20season\"&gt;wet season&lt;/a&gt;, when the water level of Laguna de Bay is high, the flow is reversed towards Manila Bay.\nThe Pasig River used to be an important transport route and source of water for &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;. Due to negligence and industrial development, the river suffered a rapid decline in the second half of the 20th century and was declared biologically dead in 1990. Two decades later after that declaration, however, a renaturation program designed to revive the river has seen the return of life to the river, including eight fish species, 39 species of birds, and 118 species of trees and other vegetation. As a result, the Pasig River received the Asian River Prize by the International River Foundation (IRF) in 2019 \nThe &lt;a href=\"Pasig%20River%20Rehabilitation%20Commission\"&gt;Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission&lt;/a&gt; (PRRC), a Philippine government agency established to oversee rehabilitation efforts for the river, is supported by private sector organisations such as the Clean and Green Foundation, Inc. which ran the \"Piso para sa Pasig\" (Filipino: \"A &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20peso\"&gt;peso&lt;/a&gt; for Pasig\") campaign in the 1990s.\nGeography.\nThe Pasig River winds generally northwestward for some from the &lt;a href=\"Laguna%20de%20Bay\"&gt;Laguna de Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the largest lake in the Philippines, to &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Bay\"&gt;Manila Bay&lt;/a&gt;, in the southern part of the island of &lt;a href=\"Luzon\"&gt;Luzon&lt;/a&gt;. From the lake, the river runs between &lt;a href=\"Taguig\"&gt;Taguig&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taytay%2C%20Rizal\"&gt;Taytay, Rizal&lt;/a&gt;, before entering &lt;a href=\"Pasig\"&gt;Pasig&lt;/a&gt;. This portion of the Pasig River, to the confluence with the &lt;a href=\"Marikina%20River\"&gt;Marikina River&lt;/a&gt; tributary, is known as the Napindan River or Napindan Channel.\nFrom there, the Pasig forms flows through &lt;a href=\"Pasig\"&gt;Pasig&lt;/a&gt; until its confluence with the &lt;a href=\"Taguig%20River\"&gt;Taguig River&lt;/a&gt;, From here, it forms the border between &lt;a href=\"Mandaluyong\"&gt;Mandaluyong&lt;/a&gt; to the north and &lt;a href=\"Makati\"&gt;Makati&lt;/a&gt; to the south.. The river then sharply turns northeast, where it has become the border between Mandaluyong and &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; before turning again westward, joining its other major tributary, the &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20River%20%28Metro%20Manila%29\"&gt;San Juan River&lt;/a&gt;, and then following a sinuous path through the center of Manila before emptying into the bay.\nThe whole river and most portions of its tributaries lie entirely within &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Manila\"&gt;Metro Manila&lt;/a&gt;, the metropolitan region of the capital. &lt;a href=\"Isla%20de%20Convalecencia\"&gt;Isla de Convalecencia&lt;/a&gt;, the only island dividing the Pasig River, can be found in Manila and it is where the &lt;a href=\"Hospicio%20de%20San%20Jose\"&gt;Hospicio de San Jose&lt;/a&gt; is located.\nTributaries and canals.\nOne major river that drains Laguna de Bay is the &lt;a href=\"Taguig%20River\"&gt;Taguig River&lt;/a&gt;, which enters into Taguig before becoming the Pateros River; it is the border between the municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Pateros\"&gt;Pateros&lt;/a&gt; and Makati. Pateros River then enters the &lt;a href=\"confluence\"&gt;confluence&lt;/a&gt; where the Napindan Channel and &lt;a href=\"Marikina%20River\"&gt;Marikina River&lt;/a&gt; meet. The &lt;a href=\"Marikina%20River\"&gt;Marikina River&lt;/a&gt; is the larger of the two major tributaries of the Pasig River, and it flows southward from the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Rizal\"&gt;Rizal&lt;/a&gt; and cuts through the &lt;a href=\"Marikina%20Valley\"&gt;Marikina Valley&lt;/a&gt;. The San Juan River drains the plateau on which &lt;a href=\"Quezon%20City\"&gt;Quezon City&lt;/a&gt; stands; its major tributary is Diliman Creek.\nWithin the city of Manila, various \"esteros\" (canals) criss-cross through the city and connect with the &lt;a href=\"Tullahan%20River\"&gt;Tullahan River&lt;/a&gt; in the north and the &lt;a href=\"Para%C3%B1aque%20River\"&gt;Para\u00f1aque River&lt;/a&gt; to the west.\nCrossings.\nA total of 21 &lt;a href=\"bridge\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt;s currently cross the Pasig. The first bridge from the source at &lt;a href=\"Laguna%20de%20Bay\"&gt;Laguna de Bay&lt;/a&gt; is the Napindan Bridge, followed by the Arsenio Jimenez Bridge to its west. Crossing the Napindan Channel in Pasig is the Bambang Bridge. The newest bridge, opened in February 2015, is the Kaunlaran Bridge that connects barangays and Sumilang in Pasig.\nThe next bridge downstream is the C.P. Garcia Bridge carrying &lt;a href=\"Circumferential%20Road%205\"&gt;C-5 Road&lt;/a&gt; and connecting the cities of Makati and Pasig. It is followed by the &lt;a href=\"Sta.%20Monica%E2%80%93Lawton%20Bridge\"&gt;Sta. Monica\u2013Lawton Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, the newest bridge opened in June 2021 that connects Lawton Avenue in Makati to Fairlane Street in Pineda, Pasig as part of the Bonifacio Global City\u2013Ortigas Link Road project approved in 2015.\nThe Guadalupe Bridge between Makati and Mandaluyong carries &lt;a href=\"EDSA\"&gt;Epifanio de los Santos Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, the major artery of Metro Manila, as well as the &lt;a href=\"MRT%20Line%203%20%28Metro%20Manila%29\"&gt;MRT Line 3&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Guadalupe%20station%20%28MRT%29\"&gt;Guadalupe station&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Boni%20station\"&gt;Boni station&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Estrella%E2%80%93Pantaleon%20Bridge\"&gt;Estrella\u2013Pantaleon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Makati\"&gt;Makati&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Mandaluyong\"&gt;Mandaluyong&lt;/a&gt; Bridges likewise connect the two cities downstream, with the latter forming the end of &lt;a href=\"Makati%20Avenue\"&gt;Makati Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe easternmost crossing in Manila is Lambingan Bridge in the district of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Ana%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Santa Ana&lt;/a&gt;. It is then followed by the Padre Zamora (Pandacan) Bridge connecting &lt;a href=\"Pandacan%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Pandacan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Mesa%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Santa Mesa&lt;/a&gt; districts, and carries the southern line of the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20National%20Railways\"&gt;Philippine National Railways&lt;/a&gt;. The expressway bridge of &lt;a href=\"Skyway%20%28Metro%20Manila%29\"&gt;Skyway&lt;/a&gt; Stage 3, serving as a connection road between the &lt;a href=\"North%20Luzon%20Expressway\"&gt;North Luzon Expressway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"South%20Luzon%20Expressway\"&gt;South Luzon Expressway&lt;/a&gt;, is built near the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20River%20%28Metro%20Manila%29\"&gt;San Juan River&lt;/a&gt; where most parts of it is built and another bridge parallel to Padre Zamora and PNR bridges will be built to merge with NLEX Connector in Santa Mesa; it will thus serve as a solution to heavy traffic along EDSA. The &lt;a href=\"Mabini%20Bridge\"&gt;Mabini Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Nagtahan Bridge) provides a crossing for Nagtahan Street, part of &lt;a href=\"Circumferential%20Road%202\"&gt;C-2 Road&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ayala%20Bridge\"&gt;Ayala Bridge&lt;/a&gt; carries Ayala Boulevard, and connects the &lt;a href=\"Isla%20de%20Convalecencia\"&gt;Isla de Convalecencia&lt;/a&gt; to both banks of the Pasig.\nFurther downstream are the &lt;a href=\"Quezon%20Bridge\"&gt;Quezon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Quiapo%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Quiapo&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ermita%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Ermita&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Light%20Rail%20Transit%20System%20Line%201\"&gt;Line 1&lt;/a&gt; bridge from &lt;a href=\"Central%20Terminal%20station%20%28LRT%29\"&gt;Central Terminal station&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Carriedo%20station\"&gt;Carriedo station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MacArthur%20Bridge%20%28Manila%29\"&gt;MacArthur Bridge&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Cruz%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt; to Ermita, and the &lt;a href=\"Jones%20Bridge\"&gt;Jones Bridge&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Binondo%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Binondo&lt;/a&gt; to Ermita. The last bridge near the mouth of the Pasig is the Roxas Bridge (also known as M. Lopez Bridge and formerly called Del Pan Bridge) from &lt;a href=\"San%20Nicolas%2C%20Manila\"&gt;San Nicolas&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Area%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Port Area&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intramuros\"&gt;Intramuros&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandmarks.\nThe growth of Manila along the banks of the Pasig River has made it a focal point for development and historical events. The foremost landmark on the banks of the river is the walled district of &lt;a href=\"Intramuros%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Intramuros&lt;/a&gt;, located near the mouth of the river on its southern bank. It was built by the Spanish colonial government in the 16th century. Further upstream is the &lt;a href=\"Hospicio%20de%20San%20Jose\"&gt;Hospicio de San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, an orphanage located on Pasig's sole island, the \"Isla de Convalescencia\". On the northern bank stands the &lt;a href=\"Quinta%20Market\"&gt;Quinta Market&lt;/a&gt; in Quiapo, Manila's central market, and &lt;a href=\"Malaca%C3%B1an%20Palace\"&gt;Malaca\u00f1an Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the official residence of the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;President of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso on Pasig River's northern bank and within the Manila district of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Mesa%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Sta. Mesa&lt;/a&gt; is the main campus of the &lt;a href=\"Polytechnic%20University%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Polytechnic University of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Makati, along the southern bank of Pasig, is &lt;a href=\"Circuit%20Makati\"&gt;Circuit Makati&lt;/a&gt; (the former Sta. Ana Race Track) and the &lt;a href=\"Rockwell%20Center\"&gt;Rockwell Center&lt;/a&gt;, a high-end office and commercial area containing the &lt;a href=\"Power%20Plant%20Mall\"&gt;Power Plant Mall&lt;/a&gt;. At the confluence of the Pasig and Marikina rivers is the Napindan Hydraulic Control Structure, which regulates the flow of water from the Napindan Channel.\nGeology.\nThe Pasig River's main watershed is concentrated in the plains between &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Bay\"&gt;Manila Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Laguna%20de%20Bay\"&gt;Laguna de Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The watershed of the &lt;a href=\"Marikina%20River\"&gt;Marikina River&lt;/a&gt; tributary mostly occupies the Marikina Valley, which was formed by the &lt;a href=\"Marikina%20Valley%20Fault%20System\"&gt;Marikina Fault Line&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Manggahan%20Floodway\"&gt;Manggahan Floodway&lt;/a&gt; is an artificially constructed waterway that aims to reduce the flooding in the Marikina Valley during the rainy season, by bringing excess water to the Laguna de Bay.\nTidal flows.\nThe Pasig River is technically considered a tidal estuary. Toward the end of the summer or dry season (April and May), the water level in Laguna de Bay reaches to a minimum of 10.5 meters. During times of &lt;a href=\"high%20tide\"&gt;high tide&lt;/a&gt;, the water level in the lake may drop below that of Manila Bay's, resulting in a reverse flow of seawater from the bay into the lake. This results in increased pollution and salinity levels in Laguna de Bay at this time of the year.\nFlooding.\nThe Pasig River is vulnerable to flooding in times of very heavy rainfall, with the Marikina River tributary the main source of the floodwater. The &lt;a href=\"Manggahan%20Floodway\"&gt;Manggahan Floodway&lt;/a&gt; was constructed to divert excess floodwater from the Marikina River into the Laguna de Bay, which serves as a temporary reservoir. By design, the Manggahan Floodway is capable of handling 2,400 cubic meters per second of water flow, with the actual flow being about 2,000 cubic meters per second. To complement the floodway, the Napindan Hydraulic Control System (NHCS) was built in 1983 at the confluence of the Marikina River and the Napindan Channel to regulate the flow of water between the Pasig River and the lake.\nHistory.\nThe Pasig River served as an important means of transport; it was &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;'s lifeline and center of economic activity. Some of the most prominent kingdoms in &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Philippines%20%28900-1521%29\"&gt;early Philippine history&lt;/a&gt;, including the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Namayan\"&gt;Namayan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Maynila\"&gt;Maynila&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Tondo\"&gt;Tondo&lt;/a&gt; grew up along the banks of the river, drawing their life and source of wealth from it. When the Spanish established Manila as the capital of their colonial properties in the Far East, they built the walled city of &lt;a href=\"Intramuros%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Intramuros&lt;/a&gt; on the southern bank of Pasig River near its mouth.\nThe commonly accepted origin for the &lt;a href=\"endonym\"&gt;endonym&lt;/a&gt; \"Tagalog\" is the term \"tag\u00e1-ilog\", which means \"people from [along] the &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;\". An alternative theory states that the name is derived from \"tag\u00e1-alog\", which means \"people from the &lt;a href=\"Ford%20%28crossing%29\"&gt;ford&lt;/a&gt;\" (the prefix \"tag\u00e1-\" meaning \"coming from\" or \"native of\"). In 1821, American diplomat &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Roberts%20%28diplomat%29\"&gt;Edmund Roberts&lt;/a&gt; called the Tagalog \"Tagalor\" in his memoirs about his trips to the Philippines.\nThe earliest written record of the Tagalog is a 9th-century document known as the &lt;a href=\"Laguna%20Copperplate%20Inscription\"&gt;Laguna Copperplate Inscription&lt;/a&gt; which is about a remission of debt on behalf of the ruler of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Tondo\"&gt;Tondo&lt;/a&gt;. Inscribed on it is year 822 of the &lt;a href=\"Saka%20Era\"&gt;Saka Era&lt;/a&gt;, the month of Waisaka, and the fourth day of the waning moon, which corresponds to Monday, April 21, 900 CE in the &lt;a href=\"Proleptic%20Gregorian%20calendar\"&gt;Proleptic Gregorian calendar&lt;/a&gt;. The writing system used is the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kawi\"&gt;Kawi Script&lt;/a&gt;, while the language is a variety of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Malay\"&gt;Old Malay&lt;/a&gt;, and contains numerous loanwords from &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin may be &lt;a href=\"Old%20Javanese\"&gt;Old Javanese&lt;/a&gt;. Some contend it is between &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tagalog\"&gt;Old Tagalog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Javanese\"&gt;Old Javanese&lt;/a&gt;.\nPollution.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, massive population growth, infrastructure construction, and the dispersal of economic activities to Manila's suburbs left the river neglected. The banks of the river attracted informal settlers and the remaining factories dumped their wastes into the river, making it effectively a huge sewer system. Industrialization had already polluted the river.\nIn the 1930s, observers noticed the increasing pollution of the river, as fish migration from Laguna de Bay diminished. People ceased using the river's water for laundering in the 1960s, and ferry transport declined. By the 1970s, the river started to emanate offensive smells, and in the 1980s, fishing in the river was prohibited. By the 1990s, the Pasig River was considered &lt;a href=\"biologically%20dead\"&gt;biologically dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is estimated that about 60-65 percent of the pollution in Pasig River comes from household waste disposed into the tributaries of the river. Increasing poverty in the rural areas in Philippines has driven migration to Metro Manila in search of better opportunities. This resulted in rapid urban growth, congestion and overcrowding of land and along the riverbanks, making the river and its tributaries a dumping ground for informal settlers living there. \nAbout 30-35 percent of the river pollution is generated from industries locating close to the river (such as tanneries, textile mills, food processing plants, distilleries, and chemical and metal plants), some of which do not have water treatment facilities which are capable of removing heavy metal pollutants. The rest of the pollutants consist of solid waste dumped into the rivers. Metro Manila has been reported to produce as much as 7,000 tons of garbage per day. In a study conducted by the researchers from &lt;a href=\"Polytechnic%20University%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Polytechnic University of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, the river is also contaminated with &lt;a href=\"microplastics\"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt;.\nRehabilitation efforts.\nEfforts to revive the river began in December 1989 with the help of &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; authorities. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Program (PRRP) was established, with the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Natural%20Resources\"&gt;Department of Environment and Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; as the main agency with the coordination of the Danish International Development Assistance (DANIDA).\nIn 1999, President &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Estrada\"&gt;Joseph Estrada&lt;/a&gt; signed Executive Order No. 54 establishing the PRRC to replace the old PRRP with additional expanded powers such as managing of wastes and resettling of squatters.\nIn 2010, the TV network &lt;a href=\"ABS-CBN\"&gt;ABS-CBN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pasig%20River%20Rehabilitation%20Commission\"&gt;Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission&lt;/a&gt; headed by ABS-CBN Foundation-Bantay Kalikasan Director &lt;a href=\"Gina%20Lopez\"&gt;Gina Lopez&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 currently serving as a chairperson of PRRC \u2013 launched a &lt;a href=\"fun%20run\"&gt;fun run&lt;/a&gt; fund-raising activity called \"\"Run for the Pasig River\" held every month of October. The proceeds from the fun run will serve as a fund for the \"Kapit-bisig para sa Ilog Pasig\"\" (Collaborate for Pasig River) rehabilitation project of Pasig River.\nIn October 2018, the PRRC won the first Asia Riverprize, in recognition of its efforts to rehabilitate the Pasig River. According to the PRRC, aquatic life has returned to the river.\nOn April 20, 2021, &lt;a href=\"San%20Miguel%20Corporation\"&gt;San Miguel Corporation&lt;/a&gt; announced that the river cleanup will begin in May 2021. SMC will also work with the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Natural%20Resources\"&gt;Department of Environment and Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Public%20Works%20and%20Highways\"&gt;Department of Public Works and Highways&lt;/a&gt; in this river cleanup. The river cleanup is part of San Miguel Corporation's &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20peso\"&gt;\u20b1&lt;/a&gt;95-billion &lt;a href=\"Pasig%20River%20Expressway\"&gt;Pasig River Expressway&lt;/a&gt; project."
