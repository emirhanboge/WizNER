    "text": "Francisco Xavier de la Paz Pizarro Mart\u00ednez (24 January 1787 \u2013 9 February 1840) was a Mexican diplomat who served as &lt;a href=\"Envoy%20Extraordinary%20and%20Minister%20Plenipotentiary\"&gt;Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; from 17 October 1837 until his death on 9 February 1840. Previously, Pizarro served as Mexican consul to &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nFrancisco Pizarro was born in &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; on 24 January 1787 to Timoteo Antonio Pizarro L\u00f3pez and Antonia San Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez, a Spanish couple from &lt;a href=\"Alc%C3%A1ntara\"&gt;Alc\u00e1ntara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Extremadura\"&gt;Extremadura&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A1diz\"&gt;C\u00e1diz&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. At 27, he married Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Visoso, a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, and daughter of a &lt;a href=\"Galician%20people\"&gt;Galician&lt;/a&gt; immigrant, on 27 April 1814.\nIn 1833, as Mexican consul of New Orleans, Pizarro refused entry to blacks and other \"people of color\" to the then-Mexican state of &lt;a href=\"Coahuila%20y%20Texas\"&gt;Coahuila y Texas&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that they were slaves in disguise and inherently lazy and immoral. After the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Revolution\"&gt;Texas Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, he negotiated a &lt;a href=\"prisoner%20exchange\"&gt;prisoner exchange&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20F.%20Austin\"&gt;Stephen F. Austin&lt;/a&gt; in the winter of 1836.\nIn May 1837, he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Mexico to the United States by President &lt;a href=\"Anastasio%20Bustamante\"&gt;Anastasio Bustamante&lt;/a&gt;. As envoy, he negotiated the \"Convention for the adjustment of claims of citizens of the United States of America upon the Government of the Mexican Republic\" with &lt;a href=\"John%20Forsyth%20%28Georgia%29\"&gt;John Forsyth&lt;/a&gt; in 1838.\nShortly thereafter, Pizarro died while on duty on 9 February 1840, at the age of 53, in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;. The President of the United States, his cabinet, and members of the diplomatic corps were present at his Catholic funeral. He was originally interred behind the Chapel of St. Francis Xavier on &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Trinity%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29%23College%20Ground\"&gt;College Ground&lt;/a&gt; (a burial ground of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Trinity%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29\"&gt;Holy Trinity Church&lt;/a&gt;) in the historical neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Georgetown%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29\"&gt;Georgetown&lt;/a&gt;. In 1953, when &lt;a href=\"Georgetown%20University\"&gt;Georgetown University&lt;/a&gt; cleared the cemetery for the construction of new buildings, his remains were transferred to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olivet%20Cemetery%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29\"&gt;Mount Olivet Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;."
