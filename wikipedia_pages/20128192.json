    "text": "\"Azzurro\" is an Italian &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; song composed by &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Conte\"&gt;Paolo Conte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vito%20Pallavicini\"&gt;Vito Pallavicini&lt;/a&gt;. Its most famous version was recorded by &lt;a href=\"Adriano%20Celentano\"&gt;Adriano Celentano&lt;/a&gt; in 1968.\nBackground.\nConte and Pallavicini wrote \"Azzurro\" especially for Celentano. The song describes a lonely summer in the city. Structurally it typically reflects Conte's writing style, combining simple and catchy melodies with unusual elements, like the &lt;a href=\"March%20%28music%29\"&gt;military march music&lt;/a&gt; bit in the middle. Conte would record the song himself in 1985, ten years into his own solo career as a performer. Together with \"Via con me\" and \"Sotto le stelle del Jazz\", it is now one of his most popular songs.\nLyrics.\nThe first line of the chorus goes: \"Azzurro, il pomeriggio \u00e8 troppo azzurro e lungo per me . . .\" (Blue, the afternoon is too long and blue for me...)\nCover versions.\nThe song was covered by numerous Italian singers, like &lt;a href=\"Mina%20%28Italian%20singer%29\"&gt;Mina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gianni%20Morandi\"&gt;Gianni Morandi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rosario%20Fiorello\"&gt;Fiorello&lt;/a&gt;. Even the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20football%20national%20team\"&gt;Italian football national team&lt;/a&gt; has sung the song on one occasion. German covers were done by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Rubin%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Peter Rubin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Die%20Toten%20Hosen\"&gt;Die Toten Hosen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Alexander%20%28Austrian%20actor%20and%20singer%29\"&gt;Peter Alexander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rummelsnuff\"&gt;Rummelsnuff&lt;/a&gt;. French cover by &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9gine\"&gt;R\u00e9gine&lt;/a&gt;. Spanish cover by &lt;a href=\"Gabinete%20Caligari\"&gt;Gabinete Caligari&lt;/a&gt;. Czech cover by &lt;a href=\"Waldemar%20Matu%C5%A1ka\"&gt;Waldemar Matu\u0161ka&lt;/a&gt;, (lyrics by &lt;a href=\"Zden%C4%9Bk%20Borovec\"&gt;Zden\u011bk Borovec&lt;/a&gt;). In the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;, German F1 driver &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20Vettel\"&gt;Sebastian Vettel&lt;/a&gt; sang a farewell song to his Ferrari team after the final race for them, which was based on the song.\nArik Einstein cover.\nIn Israel, it is a famous song known for its Hebrew version by &lt;a href=\"Arik%20Einstein\"&gt;Arik Einstein&lt;/a&gt; \"Amru Lo\" (Hebrew: \"They told him...\"), which does not feature a translation of the original lyrics, and instead lampoons a young ne'er-do-well's inexplicable obsession with the color red and a failing &lt;a href=\"soccer\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; team of the same uniform color. It was also turned as a film with the &lt;a href=\"Azzurro%20%28film%29\"&gt;same name&lt;/a&gt;.\nDie Toten Hosen cover.\n\"Azzurro\" (on many releases mistitled \"Azzuro\") was covered by &lt;a href=\"Die%20Toten%20Hosen\"&gt;Die Toten Hosen&lt;/a&gt; for the album \"&lt;a href=\"Auf%20dem%20Kreuzzug%20ins%20Gl%C3%BCck\"&gt;Auf dem Kreuzzug ins Gl\u00fcck&lt;/a&gt;\" as a tribute to &lt;a href=\"1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1990 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe single was released with differently coloured covers: &lt;a href=\"green\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orange%20%28colour%29\"&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pink\"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"yellow\"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;.\nMusic video.\nThe video was directed by &lt;a href=\"Hanns%20Christian%20M%C3%BCller\"&gt;Hanns Christian M\u00fcller&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe band drives around &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=\"Opel\"&gt;Opel&lt;/a&gt;, having to push-start it every time. In the end it gets stolen right before them."
