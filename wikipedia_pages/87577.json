    "text": "The Saab JAS 39 Gripen (; English: \"&lt;a href=\"griffin\"&gt;griffin&lt;/a&gt;\") is a &lt;a href=\"light%20fighter\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; single-engine &lt;a href=\"multirole%20combat%20aircraft\"&gt;multirole fighter aircraft&lt;/a&gt; manufactured by the Swedish &lt;a href=\"aerospace\"&gt;aerospace&lt;/a&gt; and defense company &lt;a href=\"Saab%20AB\"&gt;Saab AB&lt;/a&gt;. The Gripen has a &lt;a href=\"delta%20wing\"&gt;delta wing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canard%20%28aeronautics%29\"&gt;canard&lt;/a&gt; configuration with &lt;a href=\"relaxed%20stability\"&gt;relaxed stability&lt;/a&gt; design and &lt;a href=\"fly-by-wire\"&gt;fly-by-wire&lt;/a&gt; flight controls. Later aircraft are fully &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; interoperable. As of 2020, more than 271 Gripens of all models, A\u2013F, have been built.\nIn 1979, the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Swedish government&lt;/a&gt; began development studies for an aircraft capable of fighter, attack, and &lt;a href=\"Aerial%20reconnaissance\"&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt; missions to replace the &lt;a href=\"Saab%2035%20Draken\"&gt;Saab 35 Draken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saab%2037%20Viggen\"&gt;37 Viggen&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Swedish Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. A new design from Saab was selected and developed as the JAS 39. The first flight occurred in 1988, with delivery of the first serial production airplane in 1993. It entered service with the Swedish Air Force in 1996. Upgraded variants, featuring more advanced avionics and adaptations for longer mission times, began entering service in 2003.\nTo market the aircraft internationally, Saab formed partnerships and collaborative efforts with overseas aerospace companies. On the export market, early models of the Gripen achieved moderate success, with sales to nations in Central Europe, South Africa, and Southeast Asia. Bribery was suspected in some of these procurements, but authorities closed the investigation in 2009.\nA major redesign of the Gripen series, designated \"JAS 39E/F Gripen\" but previously referred to as \"Gripen NG\" or \"Super JAS\", began deliveries to the Swedish and &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Brazilian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;s in 2019. The changes from the C-series to E-series include a larger body, a more powerful engine, an increased weapons payload capability, and a new cockpit, avionics architecture, and electronic warfare system.\nDevelopment.\nOrigins.\nIn the late 1970s, Sweden sought to replace its aging &lt;a href=\"Saab%2035%20Draken\"&gt;Saab 35 Draken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saab%2037%20Viggen\"&gt;Saab 37 Viggen&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Swedish Air Force&lt;/a&gt; required an affordable Mach 2 aircraft with good short-field performance for a defensive dispersed basing plan in the event of invasion; the plan included 800\u00a0m long by 17\u00a0m wide rudimentary runways that were part of the &lt;a href=\"Bas%2090\"&gt;Bas 90&lt;/a&gt; system. One goal was for the aircraft to be smaller than the Viggen while equalling or improving on its payload-range characteristics. Early proposals included the &lt;a href=\"Saab%2038\"&gt;Saab 38&lt;/a&gt;, also called B3LA, intended as an attack aircraft and trainer, and the , a development of the Viggen that would have capabilities as a fighter, attack and sea reconnaissance aircraft. Several foreign designs were also studied, including the &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon\"&gt;General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet\"&gt;McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20F-20%20Tigershark\"&gt;Northrop F-20 Tigershark&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Mirage%202000\"&gt;Dassault Mirage 2000&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the Swedish government opted for a new fighter to be developed by &lt;a href=\"Saab%20Group\"&gt;Saab&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1979, the government began a study calling for a versatile platform capable of \"JAS\", standing for \"Jakt\" (&lt;a href=\"Aerial%20warfare\"&gt;air-to-air&lt;/a&gt;), \"Attack\" (&lt;a href=\"ground%20attack\"&gt;air-to-surface&lt;/a&gt;), and \"Spaning\" (reconnaissance), indicating a &lt;a href=\"Multirole%20combat%20aircraft\"&gt;multirole&lt;/a&gt;, or swingrole, fighter aircraft that can fulfill multiple roles during the same mission. Several Saab designs were reviewed, the most promising being \"Project 2105\" (redesignated \"Project 2108\" and, later, \"Project 2110\"), recommended to the government by the Defence Materiel Administration (\"F\u00f6rsvarets Materielverk\", or FMV). In 1980, \"&lt;a href=\"Industrigruppen%20JAS\"&gt;Industrigruppen JAS&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"IG JAS\", \"JAS Industry Group\") was established as a joint venture by &lt;a href=\"Saab%20Group%23History\"&gt;Saab-Scania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LM%20Ericsson\"&gt;LM Ericsson&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20Flygmotor\"&gt;Volvo Flygmotor&lt;/a&gt; and , the industrial arm of the Swedish armed forces.\nThe preferred aircraft was a single-engine, lightweight single-seater, embracing &lt;a href=\"fly-by-wire\"&gt;fly-by-wire&lt;/a&gt; technology, canards, and an aerodynamically unstable design. The powerplant selected was the &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20RM12\"&gt;Volvo-Flygmotor RM12&lt;/a&gt;, a licence-built derivative of the &lt;a href=\"General%20Electric%20F404\"&gt;General Electric F404&lt;/a&gt;\u2212400; engine development priorities were weight reduction and lowering component count. On 30 June 1982, with approval from the &lt;a href=\"Riksdag\"&gt;Riksdag&lt;/a&gt;, the FMV issued contracts worth &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20krona\"&gt;SEK&lt;/a&gt; 25.7 billion to Saab, covering five prototypes and an initial batch of 30 production aircraft. By January 1983, a Viggen was converted to a flying test aircraft for the JAS 39's intended avionics, such as the fly-by-wire controls. The JAS 39 received the name \"Gripen\" (griffin) via a public competition, which is the &lt;a href=\"heraldry\"&gt;heraldry&lt;/a&gt; on Saab's logo.\nTesting, production, and improvements.\nSaab rolled out the first Gripen on 26 April 1987, marking the company's 50th anniversary. Originally planned to fly in 1987, the first flight was delayed by 18 months due to issues with the flight control system. On 9 December 1988, the first prototype (serial number 39-1) took its 51-minute maiden flight with pilot Stig Holmstr\u00f6m at the controls. During the test programme, concern surfaced about the aircraft's avionics, specifically the fly-by-wire &lt;a href=\"Aircraft%20flight%20control%20system\"&gt;flight control system&lt;/a&gt; (FCS), and the relaxed stability design. On 2 February 1989, this issue led to the crash of the prototype during an attempted landing at &lt;a href=\"Link%C3%B6ping\"&gt;Link\u00f6ping&lt;/a&gt;; the test pilot &lt;a href=\"Lars%20R%C3%A5destr%C3%B6m\"&gt;Lars R\u00e5destr\u00f6m&lt;/a&gt; walked away with a broken elbow. The cause of the crash was identified as &lt;a href=\"pilot-induced%20oscillation\"&gt;pilot-induced oscillation&lt;/a&gt;, caused by problems with the FCS's pitch-control routine.\nIn response to the crash Saab and US firm Calspan introduced software modifications to the aircraft. A modified &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20T-33%20Shooting%20Star\"&gt;Lockheed NT-33A&lt;/a&gt; was used to test these improvements, which allowed flight testing to resume 15 months after the accident. On 8 August 1993, production aircraft 39102 was destroyed in an accident during an aerial display in &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;. Test pilot R\u00e5destr\u00f6m lost control of the aircraft during a roll at low altitude when the aircraft stalled, forcing him to eject. Saab later found the problem was high amplification of the pilot's quick and significant stick command inputs. The ensuing investigation and flaw correction delayed test flying by several months, resuming in December 1993.\nThe first order included an option for another 110, which was exercised in June 1992. Batch II consisted of 96 one-seat JAS 39As and 14 two-seat JAS 39Bs. The JAS 39B variant is 66\u00a0cm (26\u00a0in) longer than the JAS 39A to accommodate a second seat, which also necessitated the deletion of the cannon and a reduced internal fuel capacity. By April 1994, five prototypes and two series-production Gripens had been completed; but a &lt;a href=\"beyond-visual-range%20missile\"&gt;beyond-visual-range missile&lt;/a&gt; (BVR) had not yet been selected. A third batch was ordered in June 1997, composed of 50 upgraded single-seat JAS 39Cs and 14 JAS 39D two-seaters, known as 'Turbo Gripen', with NATO compatibility for exports. Batch III aircraft, delivered between 2002 and 2008, possess more powerful and updated avionics, &lt;a href=\"Aerial%20refueling\"&gt;in-flight refuelling&lt;/a&gt; capability via retractable probes on the aircraft's &lt;a href=\"Port%20and%20starboard\"&gt;starboard side&lt;/a&gt;, and an On-Board Oxygen-generating system (OBOGS) for longer duration missions. In-flight refuelling was tested via a specially equipped prototype (39\u20104) used in successful trials with a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vickers%20VC10\"&gt;VC10&lt;/a&gt; in 1998.\nTeaming agreements.\nDuring the 1995 &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Air%20Show\"&gt;Paris Air Show&lt;/a&gt;, Saab Military Aircraft and &lt;a href=\"British%20Aerospace\"&gt;British Aerospace&lt;/a&gt; (BAe, now &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems\"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt;) announced the formation the joint-venture company \"Saab-BAe Gripen AB\" with the goal of adapting, manufacturing, marketing and supporting Gripen worldwide. The deal involved the conversion of the A and B series aircraft to the \"export\" C and D series, which developed the Gripen for compatibility with &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; standards. This co-operation was extended in 2001 with the formation of \"Gripen International\" to promote export sales. In December 2004, Saab and BAE Systems announced that BAE was to sell a large portion of its stake in Saab, and that Saab would take full responsibility for marketing and export orders of the Gripen. In June 2011, Saab announced that an internal investigation revealed evidence of acts of corruption by BAE Systems, including &lt;a href=\"money%20laundering\"&gt;money laundering&lt;/a&gt;, in South Africa, one of the Gripen's customers.\nOn 26 April 2007, Norway signed a &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20krone\"&gt;NOK&lt;/a&gt;150 million joint-development agreement with Saab to co-operate in the development programme of the Gripen, including the integration of Norwegian industries in the development of future versions of the aircraft. In June of the same year, Saab also entered an agreement with &lt;a href=\"Thales%20Group\"&gt;Thales Norway A/S&lt;/a&gt; concerning the development of communications systems for the Gripen fighter. This order was the first awarded under the provisions of the Letter of Agreement signed by the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Ministry%20of%20Defence\"&gt;Norwegian Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; and Gripen International in April 2007. As a result of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20diplomatic%20cables%20leak\"&gt;United States diplomatic cables leak&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, it was revealed that US diplomats had become concerned with co-operation between Norway and Sweden on the topic of the Gripen, and had sought to exert pressure against a Norwegian purchase of the aircraft.\nIn December 2007, as part of Gripen International's marketing efforts in Denmark, a deal was signed with Danish technology supplier &lt;a href=\"Terma%20A/S\"&gt;Terma A/S&lt;/a&gt; that let them participate in an Industrial Co-operation programme over the next 10\u201315 years. The total value of the programme was estimated at over &lt;a href=\"Danish%20krone\"&gt;DKK&lt;/a&gt;10\u00a0billion, and was partly dependent on a procurement of the Gripen by Denmark. Subsequently, Denmark elected to procure the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\nControversies, scandals, and costs.\nDeveloping an advanced multi-role fighter was a major undertaking for Sweden. The predecessor Viggen, despite being less advanced and less expensive, had been criticized for occupying too much of Sweden's military budget and was branded \"a cuckoo in the military nest\" by critics as early as 1971. At the 1972 party congress of the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Sweden%29\"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, the dominant party in Swedish politics since the 1950s, a motion was passed to stop any future projects to develop advanced military aircraft. In 1982, the Gripen project passed in the &lt;a href=\"Riksdag\"&gt;Riksdag&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of 176 for and 167 against, with the entire Social Democratic party voting against the proposal due to demands for more studies. A new bill was introduced in 1983 and a final approval was given in April 1983 with the condition that the project was to have a predetermined fixed-price contract, a decision that would later be criticized as unrealistic due to later cost overruns.\nAccording to Annika Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m, in the aftermath of the 1989 and 1993 crashes, the Gripen risked a loss of credibility and the weakening of its public image. There was public speculation that failures to address technical problems exposed in the first crash had directly contributed to the second crash and thus had been avoidable. Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m observed that media elements had called for greater public accountability and explanation of the project; ill-informed media analysis had also distorted public knowledge of the Gripen. The sitting Conservative government quickly endorsed and supported the Gripen\u00a0\u2013 Minister of Defense &lt;a href=\"Anders%20Bj%C3%B6rck\"&gt;Anders Bj\u00f6rck&lt;/a&gt; issued a public reassurance that the project was very positive for Sweden. In connection to the Gripen's marketing efforts to multiple countries, including South Africa, Austria, the Czech Republic and Hungary, there were reports of widespread bribery and corruption by BAE Systems and Saab. In 2007, Swedish journalists reported that BAE had paid bribes equivalent to millions of dollars. Following criminal investigations in eight countries, only one individual in Austria, &lt;a href=\"Alfons%20Mensdorf-Pouilly\"&gt;Alfons Mensdorf-Pouilly&lt;/a&gt;, was prosecuted for bribery. The scandal tarnished the international reputation of the Gripen, BAE Systems, Saab, and Sweden.\nThe Gripen's cost has been subject to frequent attention and speculation. In 2008, Saab announced reduced earnings for that year, partly attributing this to increased marketing costs for the aircraft. In 2008, Saab disputed Norway's cost calculations for the Gripen NG as overestimated and in excess of real world performance with existing operators. A 2007 report by the European Union Institute for Security Studies stated the total research and development costs of Gripen were \u20ac1.84 billion. According to a study by &lt;a href=\"Jane%27s%20Information%20Group\"&gt;Jane's Information Group&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, the Gripen's operational cost was the lowest among several modern fighters; it was estimated at $4,700 per flight hour. The Swedish Ministry of Defense estimated the cost of the full system, comprising 60 Gripen E/F, at SEK 90 billion distributed over the period 2013\u201342. The Swedish Armed Forces estimated that maintaining 100 C/D-model aircraft until 2042 would cost SEK 60 billion, while buying aircraft from a foreign supplier would cost SEK 110 billion.\nJAS 39E/F and other developments.\nA two-seat aircraft, designated \"Gripen Demo\", was ordered in 2007 as a testbed for various upgrades. It was powered by the &lt;a href=\"General%20Electric%20F414%23Variants\"&gt;General Electric F414G&lt;/a&gt;, a development of the &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet\"&gt;Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet&lt;/a&gt;'s engine. The Gripen NG's maximum takeoff weight was increased from 14,000 to 16,000\u00a0kg (30,900\u201335,300\u00a0lb), internal fuel capacity was increased by 40 per cent by relocating the undercarriage, which also allowed for two additional &lt;a href=\"hardpoint\"&gt;hardpoint&lt;/a&gt;s be added on the fuselage underside. Its combat radius was when carrying six AAMs and &lt;a href=\"drop%20tank\"&gt;drop tank&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"PS-05/A\"&gt;PS-05/A&lt;/a&gt; radar is replaced by the new Raven ES-05 &lt;a href=\"active%20electronically%20scanned%20array\"&gt;active electronically scanned array&lt;/a&gt; (AESA) radar, which is based on the Vixen AESA radar family from &lt;a href=\"Selex%20ES\"&gt;Selex ES&lt;/a&gt; (since 2016 Finmeccanica, then &lt;a href=\"Leonardo%20S.p.A.\"&gt;Leonardo S.p.A.&lt;/a&gt;). The Gripen Demo's &lt;a href=\"maiden%20flight\"&gt;maiden flight&lt;/a&gt; was conducted on 27 May 2008. On 21 January 2009, the Gripen Demo flew at Mach 1.2 without reheat to test its &lt;a href=\"supercruise\"&gt;supercruise&lt;/a&gt; capability. The Gripen Demo served as a basis for the Gripen E/F, also referred to as the Gripen NG (Next Generation) and MS (Mission System) 21.\nSaab studied a variant of the Gripen capable of operating from aircraft carriers in the 1990s. In 2009, it launched the Sea Gripen project in response to India's request for information on a &lt;a href=\"carrier-based%20aircraft\"&gt;carrier-based aircraft&lt;/a&gt;. Brazil may also require new carrier aircraft. Following a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; (MoD) officials in May 2011, Saab agreed to establish a development center in the UK to expand on the Sea Gripen concept. In 2013, Saab's Lennart Sindahl stated that development of an optionally manned Gripen E capable of flying unmanned operations was being explored by the firm; further development of optionally manned and carrier versions would require customer commitment. On 6 November 2014, the Brazilian Navy expressed interest in a carrier-based Gripen.\nIn 2010, Sweden awarded Saab a four-year contract to improve the Gripen's radar and other equipment, integrate new weapons, and lower its operating costs. In June 2010, Saab stated that Sweden planned to order the Gripen NG, designated JAS 39E/F, and was to enter service in 2017 or earlier dependent on export orders. On 25 August 2012, following Switzerland's intention to buy 22 of the E/F variants, Sweden announced it planned to buy 40\u201360 Gripen E/Fs. The Swedish government decided to purchase 60 Gripen Es on 17 January 2013. Subsequent to a national referendum in 2014 Switzerland decided not to procure replacement fighters and postponed their procurement process.\nIn July 2013, assembly began on the first pre-production Gripen E. Originally 60 JAS 39Cs were to be retrofitted as JAS 39Es by 2023, but this was revised to Gripen Es having new-built airframes and some reused parts from JAS 39Cs. The first production aircraft is to be delivered in 2018. In March 2014, Saab revealed the detailed design and indicated plans to receive military type certification in 2018. The first Gripen E was rolled out on 18 May 2016. Saab delayed the first flight from 2016 to 2017 to focus on civilian-grade software certification; high speed taxi tests began in December 2016. In September 2015, Saab Aeronautics head Lennard Sindhal announced that an &lt;a href=\"electronic%20warfare\"&gt;Electronic Warfare&lt;/a&gt; version of the &lt;a href=\"%23Variants\"&gt;Gripen F&lt;/a&gt; two-seater was under development. On 15 June 2017, Saab completed the Gripen E's first flight. , the Gripen E had attained supersonic flight and was to commence load tests. The development flight test programme with Pre-production Gripen E continues today after the internal deliveries to both the Swedish and Brazilian Air Forces. On 24 November 2021, Saab announced that the first 6 Gripen E fighters were ready to be delivered to the Swedish and Brazilian air forces.\nDesign.\nOverview.\nThe Gripen is a multirole fighter aircraft, intended as a light-weight and agile aerial platform with advanced, highly adaptable avionics. It has &lt;a href=\"Canard%20%28aeronautics%29\"&gt;canard&lt;/a&gt; control surfaces that contribute a positive lift force at all speeds, while the generous lift from the &lt;a href=\"delta%20wing\"&gt;delta wing&lt;/a&gt; compensates for the rear stabiliser producing negative lift at high speeds, increasing &lt;a href=\"induced%20drag\"&gt;induced drag&lt;/a&gt;. Being &lt;a href=\"Relaxed%20stability%23Intentional%20instability\"&gt;intentionally unstable&lt;/a&gt; and employing digital &lt;a href=\"fly-by-wire\"&gt;fly-by-wire&lt;/a&gt; flight controls to maintain stability removes many flight restrictions, improves &lt;a href=\"Supermaneuverability\"&gt;manoeuvrability&lt;/a&gt;, and reduces drag. The Gripen also has good short takeoff performance, being able to maintain a high sink rate and strengthened to withstand the stresses of short landings. A pair of &lt;a href=\"air%20brake%20%28aircraft%29\"&gt;air brakes&lt;/a&gt; are located on the sides of the rear fuselage; the canards also angle downward to act as air brakes and decrease landing distance. It is capable of flying at a 70\u201380 degrees angle of attack.\nTo enable the Gripen to have a long service life, roughly 50 years, Saab designed it to have low maintenance requirements. Major systems such as the RM12 engine and PS-05/A radar are &lt;a href=\"modularity\"&gt;modular&lt;/a&gt; to reduce operating cost and increase reliability. The Gripen was designed to be flexible, so that newly developed sensors, computers, and armaments could be integrated as technology advances. The aircraft was estimated to be roughly 67% sourced from Swedish or European suppliers and 33% from the US.\nOne key aspect of the Gripen programme that Saab have been keen to emphasize has been technology-transfer agreements and industrial partnerships with export customers. The Gripen is typically customized to customer requirements, enabling the routine inclusion of local suppliers in the manufacturing and support processes. A number of South African firms provide components and systems \u2013 including the communications suite and electronic warfare systems \u2013 for the Gripens operated by the South African Air Force. Operators also have access to the Gripen's source code and technical documentation, allowing for upgrades and new equipment to be independently integrated. Some export customers intend to domestically assemble the Gripen; it has been proposed that Brazilian aerospace manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Embraer\"&gt;Embraer&lt;/a&gt; may produce Gripens for other export customers as well.\nAvionics and sensors.\nAll of the Gripen's avionics are fully integrated using five &lt;a href=\"MIL-STD-1553\"&gt;MIL-STD-1553&lt;/a&gt;B digital &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28computing%29\"&gt;data buses&lt;/a&gt;, in what is described as \"&lt;a href=\"sensor%20fusion\"&gt;sensor fusion&lt;/a&gt;\". The total integration of the avionics makes the Gripen a \"programmable\" aircraft, allowing software updates to be introduced over time to increase performance and allow for additional operational roles and equipment. The &lt;a href=\"Ada%20programming%20language\"&gt;Ada programming language&lt;/a&gt; was adopted for the Gripen, and is used for the primary flight controls on the final prototypes from 1996 onwards and all subsequent production aircraft. The Gripen's software is &lt;a href=\"Continuous%20delivery\"&gt;continuously being improved&lt;/a&gt; to add new capabilities, as compared to the preceding Viggen, which was updated only in an 18-month schedule.\nMuch of the data generated from the onboard sensors and by cockpit activity is digitally recorded throughout the length of an entire mission. This information can be replayed in the cockpit or easily extracted for detailed post-mission analysis using a data transfer unit that can also be used to insert mission data to the aircraft. The Gripen, like the Viggen, was designed to operate as one component of a networked national defence system, which allows for automatic exchange of information in &lt;a href=\"real-time%20data\"&gt;real-time&lt;/a&gt; between Gripen aircraft and ground facilities. According to Saab, the Gripen features \"the world's most highly developed data link\". The Gripen's Ternav tactical navigation system combines information from multiple onboard systems such as the &lt;a href=\"air%20data%20computer\"&gt;air data computer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"radar%20altimeter\"&gt;radar altimeter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; to continuously calculate the Gripen's location.\nThe Gripen entered service using the &lt;a href=\"PS-05/A\"&gt;PS-05/A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pulse-Doppler%20radar\"&gt;pulse-Doppler&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"X%20band\"&gt;X band&lt;/a&gt; multi-mode &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;, developed by &lt;a href=\"Ericsson\"&gt;Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"GEC-Marconi\"&gt;GEC-Marconi&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on the latter's advanced &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Vixen\"&gt;Blue Vixen&lt;/a&gt; radar for the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Harrier\"&gt;Sea Harrier&lt;/a&gt; that also served as the basis for the Eurofighter's &lt;a href=\"Euroradar%20CAPTOR\"&gt;CAPTOR&lt;/a&gt; radar. The all-weather radar is capable of locating and identifying targets 120\u00a0km (74\u00a0mi) away, and automatically tracking multiple targets in the upper and lower spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air. It can guide several &lt;a href=\"beyond%20visual%20range\"&gt;beyond visual range&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"air-to-air%20missile\"&gt;air-to-air missile&lt;/a&gt;s to multiple targets simultaneously. Saab stated the PS-05/A is able to handle all types of air defence, air-to-surface, and reconnaissance missions, and is developing a Mark 4 upgrade to it. The Mark 4 version has a 150% increase in high-altitude air-to-air detection ranges, detection and tracking of smaller targets at current ranges, 140% improvement in air-to-air mode at low altitude, and full integration of modern weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"AIM-120%20AMRAAM%23Air-to-air%20missile%20versions\"&gt;AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AIM-9%20Sidewinder%23AIM-9X\"&gt;AIM-9X Sidewinder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"MBDA\"&gt;MBDA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28missile%29\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt; missiles.\nThe future Gripen E/F will use a new &lt;a href=\"active%20electronically%20scanned%20array\"&gt;Active Electronically Scanned Array&lt;/a&gt; (AESA) radar, Raven ES-05, based on the Vixen AESA radar family from &lt;a href=\"Selex%20ES\"&gt;Selex ES&lt;/a&gt;. Among other improvements, the new radar is to be capable of scanning over a greatly increased field of view and improved range. In addition, the new Gripen integrates the Skyward-G &lt;a href=\"Infra-red%20search%20and%20track\"&gt;Infra-red search and track&lt;/a&gt; (IRST) sensor, which is capable of passively detecting thermal emissions from air and ground targets in the aircraft's vicinity. The sensors of the Gripen E are claimed to be able to detect low &lt;a href=\"radar%20cross-section\"&gt;radar cross-section&lt;/a&gt; (RCS) targets at beyond visual range. Targets are tracked by a \"best sensor dominates\" system, either by onboard sensors or through the Transmitter Auxiliary Unit (TAU) data link function of the radar.\nCockpit.\nThe primary flight controls are compatible with the Hands On Throttle-And-Stick (&lt;a href=\"HOTAS\"&gt;HOTAS&lt;/a&gt;) control principle\u00a0\u2013 the centrally mounted stick, in addition to flying the aircraft, also controls the cockpit displays and weapon systems. A triplex, digital &lt;a href=\"fly-by-wire\"&gt;fly-by-wire&lt;/a&gt; system is employed on the Gripen's flight controls, with a mechanical backup for the throttle. Additional functions, such as communications, navigational and decision support data, can be accessed via the Up Front Control Panel, directly above the central cockpit display. The Gripen includes the EP-17 cockpit display system, developed by Saab to provide pilots with a high level of situational awareness and reduces pilot workload through intelligent information management. The Gripen features a &lt;a href=\"sensor%20fusion\"&gt;sensor fusion&lt;/a&gt; capability, information from onboard sensors and databases is combined, automatically analysed, and useful data is presented to the pilot via a wide field-of-view &lt;a href=\"Head-Up%20Display\"&gt;Head-Up Display&lt;/a&gt;, three large multi-function colour displays, and optionally a &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20Mounted%20Display%20System\"&gt;Helmet Mounted Display System&lt;/a&gt; (HMDS).\nOf the three Multi-Function Displays (MFD), the central display is for navigational and mission data, the display to the left of the center shows aircraft status and &lt;a href=\"electronic%20warfare\"&gt;electronic warfare&lt;/a&gt; information, and the display to the right of the center has sensory and fire control information. In two-seat variants, the rear seat's displays can be operated independently of the pilot's own display arrangement in the forward seat, Saab has promoted this capability as being useful during electronic warfare and &lt;a href=\"reconnaissance\"&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt; missions, and while carrying out command and control activities. In May 2010, Sweden began equipping their Gripens with additional onboard computer systems and new displays. The MFDs are interchangeable and designed for redundancy in the event of failure, flight information can be presented on any of the displays.\nSaab and BAE developed the Cobra HMDS for use in the Gripen, based on the Striker HMDS used on the Eurofighter. By 2008, the Cobra HMDS was fully integrated on operational aircraft, and is available as an option for export customers; it has been retrofitted into older Swedish and South African Gripens. The HMDS provides control and information on target cueing, sensor data, and flight parameters, and is optionally equipped for night time operations and with chemical/biological filtration. All connections between the HMDS and the cockpit were designed for rapid detachment, for safe use of the ejection system.\nEngine.\nAll in-service Gripens as of January 2014 are powered by a &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20RM12\"&gt;Volvo RM12&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"turbofan\"&gt;turbofan&lt;/a&gt; engine (now &lt;a href=\"GKN\"&gt;GKN&lt;/a&gt; Aerospace Engine Systems), a licence-manufactured derivative of &lt;a href=\"General%20Electric%20F404\"&gt;General Electric F404&lt;/a&gt;, fed by a &lt;a href=\"Y-duct\"&gt;Y-duct&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Splitter%20plate%20%28aeronautics%29\"&gt;splitter plates&lt;/a&gt;; changes include increased performance and improved reliability to meet single engine use safety criteria, as well as a greater resistance to &lt;a href=\"bird%20strike\"&gt;bird strike&lt;/a&gt; incidents. Several subsystems and components were also redesigned to reduce maintenance demands. By November 2010, the Gripen had accumulated over 143,000 flight hours without a single engine-related failure or incident; Rune Hyrefeldt, head of Military Program management at Volvo Aero, stated: \"I think this must be a hard record to beat for a single-engine application\".\nThe JAS 39E and F variants under development are to adopt the F414G powerplant, a variant of the &lt;a href=\"General%20Electric%20F414\"&gt;General Electric F414&lt;/a&gt;. The F414G can produce 20% greater thrust than the current RM12 engine, enabling the Gripen to &lt;a href=\"supercruise\"&gt;supercruise&lt;/a&gt; (fly at &lt;a href=\"supersonic%20speed\"&gt;supersonic speed&lt;/a&gt; without the use of &lt;a href=\"afterburners\"&gt;afterburners&lt;/a&gt;) at a speed of Mach\u00a01.1 while carrying an air-to-air combat payload. In 2010, Volvo Aero stated it was capable of further developing its RM12 engine to better match the performance of the F414G, and claimed that developing the RM12 would be a less expensive option. Prior to Saab's selection of the F414G, the &lt;a href=\"Eurojet%20EJ200\"&gt;Eurojet EJ200&lt;/a&gt; had also been under consideration for the Gripen; proposed implementations included the use of &lt;a href=\"thrust%20vectoring\"&gt;thrust vectoring&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment and armaments.\nThe Gripen is compatible with a number of different armaments, beyond the aircraft's single 27\u00a0mm &lt;a href=\"Mauser%20BK-27\"&gt;Mauser BK-27&lt;/a&gt; cannon (omitted on the two-seat variants), including air-to-air missiles such as the &lt;a href=\"AIM-9%20Sidewinder\"&gt;AIM-9 Sidewinder&lt;/a&gt;, air-to-ground missiles such as the &lt;a href=\"AGM-65%20Maverick\"&gt;AGM-65 Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"anti-ship%20missile\"&gt;anti-ship missile&lt;/a&gt;s such as the &lt;a href=\"RBS-15\"&gt;RBS-15&lt;/a&gt;. In 2010, the Swedish Air Force's Gripen fleet completed the MS19 upgrade process, enabling compatibility with a range of weapons, including the long-range &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28missile%29\"&gt;MBDA Meteor&lt;/a&gt; missile, the short-range &lt;a href=\"IRIS-T\"&gt;IRIS-T&lt;/a&gt; missile and the GBU-49 laser-guided bomb. Speaking on the Gripen's selection of armaments, Saab's campaign director for India Edvard de la Motte stated that: \"If you buy Gripen, select where you want your weapons from. Israel, Sweden, Europe, US\u2026 South America. It's up to the customer\".\nIn flight, the Gripen is typically capable of carrying up to of assorted armaments and equipment. Equipment includes external sensor pods for reconnaissance and target designation, such as &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Advanced%20Defense%20Systems\"&gt;Rafael&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"LITENING\"&gt;LITENING&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"targeting%20pod\"&gt;targeting pod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saab%20Group\"&gt;Saab&lt;/a&gt;'s Modular Reconnaissance Pod System, or &lt;a href=\"Thales%20Group\"&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt;' Digital Joint Reconnaissance Pod. The Gripen has an advanced and integrated &lt;a href=\"electronic%20warfare\"&gt;electronic warfare&lt;/a&gt; suite, capable of operating in an undetectable passive mode or to actively jam hostile radar; a missile approach warning system passively detects and tracks incoming missiles. In November 2013, it was announced that Saab will be the first to offer the &lt;a href=\"BriteCloud\"&gt;BriteCloud&lt;/a&gt; expendable Active jammer developed by &lt;a href=\"Selex%20ES\"&gt;Selex ES&lt;/a&gt;. In June 2014, the Enhanced Survivability Technology Modular Self Protection Pod, a defensive missile countermeasure pod, performed its first flight on the Gripen.\nSaab describes the Gripen as a \"swing-role aircraft\", stating that it is capable of \"instantly switching between roles at the push of a button\". The human/machine interface changes when switching between roles, being optimized by the computer in response to new situations and threats. The Gripen is also equipped to use a number of different communications standards and systems, including SATURN secure radio, Link-16, ROVER, and satellite uplinks. Equipment for performing long range missions, such as an &lt;a href=\"air-to-air%20refuelling\"&gt;air-to-air refuelling&lt;/a&gt; probe and Onboard Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS), was integrated on the Gripen C/D.\nUsability and maintenance.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Swedish Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; were to be ready to defend against a possible invasion. This scenario required defensive &lt;a href=\"force%20dispersal\"&gt;force dispersal&lt;/a&gt; of combat aircraft in the &lt;a href=\"Bas%2090\"&gt;Bas 90&lt;/a&gt; system to maintain an air defence capacity. Thus, a key design goal during the Gripen's development was the ability to take off from snow-covered landing strips of only ; furthermore, a short-turnaround time of just ten minutes, during which a team composed of a technician and five conscripts would be able to re-arm, refuel, and perform basic inspections and servicing inside that time window before returning to flight for air-to-air missions. For air-to-ground missions this turnaround time using the same resource is slightly longer at twenty minutes.\nDuring the design process, great priority was placed on facilitating and minimizing aircraft maintenance; in addition to a maintenance-friendly layout, many subsystems and components require little or no maintenance at all. Aircraft are fitted with a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) that monitors the performance of various systems, and provides information to technicians to assist in servicing it. Saab operates a continuous improvement programme; information from the HUMS and other systems can be submitted for analysis. According to Saab, the Gripen provides \"50% lower operating costs than its best competitor\".\nA 2012 Jane's Aerospace and Defense Consulting study compared the operational costs of a number of modern combat aircraft, concluding that Gripen had the lowest \"cost per flight hour\" (CPFH) when fuel used, pre-flight preparation and repair, and scheduled airfield-level maintenance together with associated personnel costs were combined. The Gripen had an estimated CPFH of US$4,700 whereas the next lowest, the F-16 Block 40/50, had a 49% higher CPFH at $7,000.\nOperational history.\nSweden.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Swedish Air Force&lt;/a&gt; placed a total order for 204 Gripens in three batches. The first delivery occurred on 8 June 1993, when 39102 was handed over to the \"Flygvapnet\" during a ceremony at Link\u00f6ping; the last of the first batch was handed over on 13 December 1996. The Air Force received its first Batch II example on 19 December 1996. Instead of the fixed-price agreement of Batch I, Batch II aircraft were paid as a \"target price\" concept: any cost underruns or overruns would be split between FMV and Saab.\nThe JAS 39 entered service with the &lt;a href=\"Skaraborg%20Wing\"&gt;Skaraborg Wing&lt;/a&gt; (F 7) on 1 November 1997. The final Batch three aircraft was delivered to FMV on 26 November 2008. This was accomplished at 10% less than the agreed-upon price for the batch, putting the JAS 39C &lt;a href=\"flyaway%20cost\"&gt;flyaway cost&lt;/a&gt; at under US$30\u00a0million. This batch of Gripens was equipped for in-flight refuelling from specially equipped &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules\"&gt;TP84s&lt;/a&gt;. In 2007, a programme was started to upgrade 31 of the air force's JAS 39A/B fighters to JAS 39C/Ds. The SwAF had a combined 134 JAS 39s in service in January 2013. In March 2015, the Swedish Air Force received its final JAS 39C.\nOn 29 March 2011, the Swedish parliament approved the Swedish Air Force for a 3-month deployment to support the UN-mandated no-fly zone over Libya. Deployment of eight Gripens, ten pilots, and other personnel began on 2 April. On 8 June 2011, the Swedish government announced an agreement to extend the deployment for five of the Gripens. By October 2011, Gripens had flown more than 650 combat missions, almost 2,000 flight hours, and delivered approximately 2,000 reconnaissance reports to NATO. Journalist Tim Hepher suggested that the Libyan operations might stimulate sales of the Gripen and other aircraft.\nIn November 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Lars Helmrich of the Swedish Air Force testified to the Riksdag regarding the Gripen\u00a0E. He stated that the current version of the Gripen would be outdated in air-to-air combat by 2020. With 60 Gripens having been judged to be the minimum required to defend Swedish Airspace, the Swedish Air Force wants to have 60\u201380 Gripens upgraded to the E/F standard by 2020.\nOn 25 August 2012, the Swedish government announced that 40\u201360 JAS 39E/F Gripens were expected to be procured and in service by 2023. On 11 December 2012, the Riksdag approved the purchase of 40 to 60 JAS 39E/Fs with an option to cancel if at least 20 aircraft are not ordered by other customers. on 17 January 2013, the government approved the deal for 60 JAS 39Es to be delivered between 2018 and 2027. On 3 March 2014, the Swedish defence minister stated that another 10 JAS 39Es might be ordered; this was later confirmed by the government.\nThere are also plans to keep some of the Gripen C/D active after 2025. This was recommended by the Swedish defence advisory committee in 2019.\nIn 2006, Swedish Gripen aircraft participated in &lt;a href=\"Red%20Flag%20%E2%80%93%20Alaska\"&gt;Red Flag \u2013 Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, a multinational air combat exercise hosted by the United States Air Force. Gripen flew simulated combat sorties against F-16 Block 50, Eurofighter Typhoon and F-15C and scored ten kills, including a Eurofighter Typhoon and five F-16 Block 50s on day one of the exercises with no losses. Three Swedish Gripen C also participated in a war game against five Royal Norwegian Air Force's F-16 Block 50 fighters in Sweden. Swedish Gripen C and Norwegian F-16 flew three combat sorties; Gripen C scored five kills in each sorties against Norwegian F-16, on the last sortie F-16 scored a kill against Gripen.\nCzech Republic.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; became a NATO member in 1999, the need to replace their existing Soviet-built MiG-21 fleet with aircraft compatible with NATO interoperability standards became apparent. In 2000, the Czech Republic began evaluating a number of aircraft, including the F-16, F/A-18, Mirage 2000, Eurofighter Typhoon and the Gripen. One major procurement condition was the industrial &lt;a href=\"offset%20agreement\"&gt;offset agreement&lt;/a&gt;, set at 150% of the expected purchase value. In December 2001, having reportedly been swayed by Gripen International's generous financing and offset programme, the Czech government announced that the Gripen had been selected. In 2002, the deal was delayed until after parliamentary elections had taken place; alternative means of air defence were also studied, including leasing the aircraft.\nOn 14 June 2004, it was announced that the Czech Republic was to lease 14 Gripen aircraft, modified to comply with NATO standards. The agreement also included the training of Czech pilots and technicians in Sweden. The first six were delivered on 18 April 2005. The lease was for an agreed period of 10 years at a cost of \u20ac780 million; the 14 ex-Swedish Air Force aircraft included 12 single-seaters and two JAS 39D two-seat trainers. In September 2013, the Defence and Security Export Agency announced that a follow-up agreement with the Czech Republic had been completed to extend the lease by 14 years, until 2029; leased aircraft shall also undergo extensive modernization, including the adoption of new datalinks. The lease also has an option of eventually acquiring the fighters outright. In 2014, the lease was extended to 2027 and the Saab service contract was extended to 2026.\nIn November 2014, Czech Air Force commander General Libor \u0160tef\u00e1nik proposed leasing a further six Gripens due to Russia's deteriorating relationship with the West; a Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated that the notion was the commander's personal vision and fleet expansion was not on the agenda for years to come. In 2015, the service decided to upgrade its fleet to the MS20 configuration. The MS20 upgrade was completed in 2018.\nHungary.\nFollowing Hungary's membership of NATO in 1999, there were several proposals to achieve a NATO-compatible fighter force. Considerable attention went into studying second-hand aircraft options as well as modifying the nation's existing MiG-29 fleet. In 2001, Hungary received several offers of new and used aircraft from various nations, including Sweden, Belgium, Israel, Turkey, and the US. Although the Hungarian government initially intended to procure the F-16, in November 2001 it was in the process of negotiating a 10-year lease contract for 12 Gripen aircraft, with an option to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease period.\nAs part of the procurement arrangements, Saab had offered an offset deal valued at 110 per cent of the cost of the 14 fighters. Initially, Hungary had planned to lease several Batch II aircraft; however, the inability to conduct &lt;a href=\"aerial%20refuelling\"&gt;aerial refuelling&lt;/a&gt; and weapons compatibility limitations had generated Hungarian misgivings. The contract was renegotiated and was signed on 2 February 2003 for a total of 14 Gripens, which had originally been A/B standard and had undergone an extensive upgrade process to the NATO-compatible C/D 'Export Gripen' standard. The last aircraft deliveries took place in December 2007.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Hungarian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; operates a total of 14 Gripen aircraft under lease, in 2011, the country reportedly intended to purchase these aircraft outright. However, in January 2012, the Hungarian and Swedish governments agreed to extend the lease period for a further ten years; according to Hungarian Defence Minister Csaba Hende, the agreement represented considerable cost savings.\nTwo Gripens were lost in crashes in May and June 2015, leaving 12 Gripens in operation. From 2017, Hungary is back to operating 14 fighters.\nIn August 2021 contract was signed with Saab to modernize the Gripen fleet of the Hungarian Air Force. The radar will be upgraded to \"PS-05/Mk4\" and the software will be upgraded to \"MS 20 Block 2\" level. New weapons would be added to the arsenal of the Hunagrian Gripens. The IRIS-T missiles has been ordered in December, 2021.\nSouth Africa.\nIn 1999, South Africa signed a contract with BAe/Saab for the procurement of 26 Gripens (C/D standard) with minor modifications to meet their requirements. Deliveries to the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Air%20Force\"&gt;South African Air Force&lt;/a&gt; commenced in April 2008. By April 2011, 18 aircraft (nine two-seater aircraft and nine single-seaters) had been delivered. While the establishment of a Gripen Fighter Weapon School at &lt;a href=\"Overberg%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Overberg Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa had been under consideration, in July 2013 Saab ruled out the option due to a lack of local support for the initiative; Thailand is an alternative location being considered, as well as the \u010c\u00e1slav Czech air base.\nBetween April 2013 and December 2013, South African contractors held prime responsibility for maintenance work on the Gripen fleet as support contracts with Saab had expired; this arrangement led to fears that extended operations may not be possible due to a lack of proper maintenance. In December 2013, &lt;a href=\"Armscor%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Armscor&lt;/a&gt; awarded Saab a long-term support contract for the company to perform engineering, maintenance, and support services on all 26 Gripens through 2016. On 13 March 2013, South African Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula stated that \"almost half of the SAAF Gripens\" have been stored because of an insufficient budget to keep them flying. In September 2013, the SAAF decided not to place a number of its Gripens in long-term storage; instead all 26 aircraft would be rotated between flying cycles and short-term storage. Speaking in September 2013, Brigadier-General John Bayne testified that the Gripen met the SAAF's minimum requirements, as the country faced no military threats.\nThailand.\nIn 2007, Thailand's Parliament authorized the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Thai%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Thai Air Force&lt;/a&gt; to spend up to 34 billion baht (US$1.1 billion) as part of an effort to replace Thailand's existing &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20F-5\"&gt;Northrop F-5&lt;/a&gt; fleet. In February 2008, the Thai Air Force ordered six Gripens (two single-seat C-models and four two-seat D-models) from Saab; deliveries began in 2011. Thailand ordered six more Gripen Cs in November 2010; deliveries began in 2013. Thailand may eventually order as many as 40 Gripens. In 2010, Thailand selected the &lt;a href=\"Surat%20Thani%20Airport\"&gt;Surat Thani Airbase&lt;/a&gt; as the main operating base for its Gripens. The first of the six aircraft were delivered on 22 February 2011.\nSaab delivered three Gripens in April 2013, and three more in September 2013. In September 2013, Air Force Marshal Prajin Jantong stated that Thailand is interested in purchasing six aircraft more in the near future, pending government approval. Thai Supreme Commander General Thanasak Patimapragorn has stated that the Air Force intends for the Gripen's information systems to be integrated with Army and Navy systems. The armed forces were to officially inaugurate the Gripen Integrated Air Defence System during 2014.\nDuring the Falcon Strike exercise 2019, the Royal Thai Air Force Gripen C/D scores 25 J-11A aircraft kills in simulated combat with the Peoples Liberation Army Air Force with only two losses within visual range combat and the Royal Thai Air Force Gripen C/D scores 41 J-11A aircraft kills with loss of five Gripen C in a simulated beyond visual range combat.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Test%20Pilots%27%20School\"&gt;Empire Test Pilots' School&lt;/a&gt; (ETPS) in the United Kingdom has used the Gripen for advanced fast jet training of test pilots under a \"wet lease\" arrangement since 1999. It operates a Gripen D aircraft.\nBrazil.\nIn October 2008, Brazil selected three finalists for its &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Air%20Force%23Developments\"&gt;F-X2 fighter programme&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Rafale%23Failed%20bids\"&gt;Dassault Rafale B/C&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet\"&gt;Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet&lt;/a&gt;, and the Gripen NG. The &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Brazilian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; initially planned to procure at least 36 and possibly up to 120 later, to replace its &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20F-5%23Brazil\"&gt;Northrop F\u20105EM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Mirage%202000%23Mirage%202000C\"&gt;Dassault Mirage 2000C&lt;/a&gt; aircraft. In February 2009, Saab submitted a tender for 36 Gripen NGs. In early 2010, the Brazilian Air Force's final evaluation report reportedly placed the Gripen ahead, a decisive factor being lower unit cost and operational costs. Amid delays due to financial constraints, there were reports in 2010 of the Rafale's selection, and in 2011 of the F/A-18's selection. On 18 December 2013, President &lt;a href=\"Dilma%20Rousseff\"&gt;Dilma Rousseff&lt;/a&gt; announced the Gripen NG's selection. Key factors were domestic manufacturing opportunities, full Transfer of Technology (ToT), participation in its development, and potential exports to Africa, Asia and Latin America; Argentina and Ecuador are interested in procuring Gripens via Brazil, and Mexico is considered an export target. Another factor was the distrust of the US due to the &lt;a href=\"Global%20surveillance%20disclosures%20%282013%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;NSA surveillance scandal&lt;/a&gt;. The Gripen is not immune to foreign pressure: the UK may use their 30% component percentage in the Gripen to veto an Argentinan sale over the &lt;a href=\"Falkland%20Islands%20sovereignty%20dispute\"&gt;Falkland Islands dispute&lt;/a&gt;; thus Argentina is considering other fighters instead.\nOn 24 October 2014, Brazil and Sweden signed a 39.3 billion SEK (US$5.44 bn, R$13 bn) contract for 28 Gripen E (single-seat version) and 8 Gripen F (dual-seat version) fighters for delivery from 2019 to 2024 and maintained until 2050; the Swedish government will provide a subsidized 25-year, 2.19% interest rate loan for the buy. At least 15 aircraft are to be assembled in Brazil, Brazilian companies shall be involved in its production; Gripen Fs are to be delivered later. An almost US$1 billion price increase since selection is due to developments requested by Brazil, such as the \"Wide Area Display\" (WAD), a panoramic 19 by 8\u202finches touchscreen display. The compensation package is set at US$9 billion, or 1.7 times the order value. The &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Navy\"&gt;Brazilian Navy&lt;/a&gt; is interested in the &lt;a href=\"%23Variants\"&gt;Gripen Maritime&lt;/a&gt; to replace its &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20A-4%20Skyhawk%23Brazil\"&gt;Douglas A-4KU Skyhawk&lt;/a&gt; carrier-based fighters. In 2015, Brazil and Sweden finalised the deal to develop the Gripen F, designated F-39 by Brazil.\nThe first Brazilian F-39E Gripen flight took place on 26 August 2019, from Saab's factory airfield in Link\u00f6ping, Sweden. The unit was handed over to the Brazilian Air Force on 10 September 2019 for the flight test programme. The fighter arrived in Brazil on 20 September 2020, and then was transported by land to &lt;a href=\"Navegantes%20Airport\"&gt;Navegantes International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. On 24 September, it took off to the &lt;a href=\"Embraer%20Unidade%20Gavi%C3%A3o%20Peixoto%20Airport\"&gt;Embraer unit in Gavi\u00e3o Peixoto&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt; state, to start the test program for flight control systems, weapon integration, communication systems and others. The fighters will be part of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Brazilian%20Air%20Force%20units\"&gt;1st Air Defense Group&lt;/a&gt; (1\u00ba GDA), based at the &lt;a href=\"An%C3%A1polis%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;An\u00e1polis Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;. The deliveries of operational fighters will begin in 2021. According to Saab executive Eddy De La Motte, the first F-39F will be delivered in 2023. In 2021, Brazil started supersonic flight tests of F-39E aircraft at high altitude above 16,000 feet. According to Saab executive Mikael Franz\u00e9n, Brazil will start to receive the first production aircraft with IRST from November 2021. The Brazilian Air Force has a requirement for 108 Gripens, to be delivered in three batches.\nOn 1 February 2022, the Commander of the Brazilian Air Force &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20de%20Almeida%20Baptista%20J%C3%BAnior\"&gt;Carlos de Almeida Baptista J\u00fanior&lt;/a&gt;, told newspaper &lt;a href=\"Folha%20de%20S.Paulo\"&gt;Folha de S.Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, that Brazil is in initial planning phase for negotiations with Saab for a new batch of 30 Gripen E/Fs, \"our capacity planning takes us today, by our employment assumptions, to 66 Gripens in operation\", this planning phase is expected to be finished by mid-2022. The negociation and Brazilian intention was confirmed by the Saab's chief executive H\u00e5kan Buskhe in February 2019. The confirmation comes after rumors in the specialized defense media in Brazil, that the Air Force saw the Lockheed Martin F-35 as an ideal candidate to continue the process of modernization of the branch in the coming years, after Gripen's recent failed bids in Finland and Switzerland, rumors that was denied by Baptista J\u00fanior.\nPotential operators.\nAustria.\nAustria is considering replacing their &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; fighters with the Gripen due to obsolescence and costs, as they are all Tranche 1 and would have to be upgraded.\nBotswana.\nIn 2014, Saab opened an office in Botswana. The country is interested in buying eight surplus Gripen C/Ds, with possible extension to 16, to replace the &lt;a href=\"Botswana%20Defence%20Force%20Air%20Wing\"&gt;Botswana Defence Force Air Wing&lt;/a&gt;'s (BDF) 14 ex-Royal Canadian Air Force &lt;a href=\"Canadair%20CF-5\"&gt;CF-5&lt;/a&gt; fighters used since 1996. BDF officials reportedly believe the Gripen acquisition is a done deal.\nCanada.\nCanada is a level 3 industrial partner in the &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II\"&gt;Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Strike%20Fighter%20program\"&gt;development program&lt;/a&gt;, however an open fighter competition was launched in December 2017. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Canadian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; announced in February 2018 that Saab was a contestant along with the F-35. The competition is very dependent on industrial benefits for Canadian companies; in May 2019, Saab offered to build Gripens in Canada akin to the Brazilian arrangement. \nIn June 2019, Saab stated it was ready to offer 88 Gripen Es to Canada, in addition to full transfer of technology, Saab stated that they could offer the integration of American and other non-Saab equipment so that the aircraft is interoperable with the US military. Saab also stated the Gripen E was built for &lt;a href=\"arctic\"&gt;arctic&lt;/a&gt; conditions. In January 2021, Saab has offered to build two aerospace centers in Canada as part of the technology transfer proposal. On 1 December 2021, the Canadian government confirmed that the Super Hornet did not meet its requirements and reduced the competitors to the F-35 and the Gripen.\nColombia.\nSaab has offered 15 Gripen C/D or E/F to Colombia, with possible deliveries during 2018\u201321, depending on variant selected.\nIndia.\nThe Gripen was a contender for the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20MRCA%20competition\"&gt;Indian MRCA competition&lt;/a&gt; for 126 multirole combat aircraft. In April 2008, Gripen International offered the Next Generation Gripen for India's tender and opened an office in New Delhi to support its efforts in the Indian market. On 4 February 2009, Saab announced that it had partnered with India's &lt;a href=\"Tata%20Group\"&gt;Tata Group&lt;/a&gt; to develop the Gripen to fit India's needs. The &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Indian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (IAF) conducted extensive evaluations of the Gripen's flight performance, logistics capability, weapons systems, advanced sensors and weapons firing. In April 2011, the IAF rejected the bid in favour of the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Dassault Rafale. Allegedly, IAF officials, while happy with the improved capabilities of Gripen NG, identified its high reliance on US-supplied hardware, including electronics, weaponry and the GE F414 engine, as a factor that may hamper exports.\nIn 2015, after the Rafale order was cut back to just 36 aircraft, Saab indicated a willingness to set up joint production of the Gripen in India. In October 2016, Saab, among other manufacturers, reportedly received an informal request-for-information query, resuming a new competition for a single-engine fighter to replace the IAF's Soviet-built MiG-21 and MiG-27 fleets; Saab had already submitted an unsolicited bid. In November 2017, Saab pledged full Gripen E &lt;a href=\"technology%20transfer\"&gt;technology transfer&lt;/a&gt; to India if it is awarded the contract. The Gripen is now competing with 6 other types in a fresh tender which is referred as &lt;a href=\"Indian%20MRCA%20competition%23MMRCA%202.0\"&gt;MMRCA 2.0&lt;/a&gt; in the Indian media, for the procurement of 114 multi-role combat aircraft.\nIndonesia.\nIn July 2016, Saab Indonesia confirmed having submitted a proposal earlier in the year in response to an &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Indonesian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; requirement. The proposal included the initial acquisition of 16 Gripen C/D for US$1.5 billion, to replace &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20F-5E%20Tiger%20II\"&gt;Northrop F-5E Tiger II&lt;/a&gt; in service with the &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20Air%20Force%23Rebirth%20%281970%E2%80%931980%29\"&gt;Indonesian Air Force since the 1980s&lt;/a&gt;. Saab have expressed the intention for the bid to \"100%\" comply with Indonesia's Defence Industry Law 2012 (or, Law Number 16), which requires foreign contractors to work with local industry, collaborating on production and sharing technology. They also indicated that the bid could replace the C/D versions with the E-version, if Indonesia were willing to accept longer delivery time. Competing aircraft responding to the requirement include the &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon%20variants%23F-16V\"&gt;F-16V&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sukhoi%20Su-35\"&gt;Su-35&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Rafale\"&gt;Rafale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter Typhoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhilippines.\nIn September 2016, Saab announced its intention to open an office in &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; to support its campaign to sell the Gripen to fill the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Philippine Air Force&lt;/a&gt;'s requirement for 12 multirole fighters; Saab also intends to offer ground infrastructure, &lt;a href=\"Command%20and%20control\"&gt;integrated C2 systems&lt;/a&gt; and datalinks, similar to the capabilities of the Royal Thai Air Force. In 2018, Saab renewed its sales push. According to the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20National%20Defense%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Department of National Defense (Philippines)&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of National Defense is more likely to buy six Gripen C/D MS20 over the US offer of &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon%20variants\"&gt;F-16V Block 70/72&lt;/a&gt;.\nOthers.\nOther countries that have expressed interest in Gripen include:\nSaab's head of exports Eddy de La Motte has stated that the Gripen's chances have improved as nations waver in their commitments to the F-35. In September 2013, Saab's CEO &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A5kan%20Buskhe\"&gt;H\u00e5kan Buskhe&lt;/a&gt; said he envisioned Gripen sales to reach 400 or 450 aircraft.\nFailed bids.\nBelgium.\nSweden withdrew from the Belgian F-16 replacement competition due to foreign policy incompatibility.\nBulgaria.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Bulgarian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; expressed interest in the Gripen, the &lt;a href=\"Gerdzhikov%20Government\"&gt;Gerdzhikov caretaker cabinet&lt;/a&gt; announced on 26 April 2017 that a state commission chose Saab's fighter, planning for an initial batch of eight Gripens at up to 1.5 billion &lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20Lev\"&gt;BGN&lt;/a&gt; (ca. 745 million &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;), to be delivered in the 2018\u201320 timeframe, with a planned follow-up batch of another eight fighters. Competing bids were used &lt;a href=\"USAF\"&gt;USAF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"F-16\"&gt;F-16&lt;/a&gt;A/Bs to be refurbished and modernised to MLU standard by the &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"OGMA\"&gt;OGMA&lt;/a&gt; (similar to Bulgaria's neighbour &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;) and used &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; Tranche 1 &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter Typhoon&lt;/a&gt;s, with the US/Portuguese offer finishing second and the Italian offer third. According to the deputy prime minister and minister of defence Stefan Yanev, the main reason for the Gripen's selection was the favourable financial terms offered by &lt;a href=\"Saab%20Group\"&gt;Saab&lt;/a&gt;, including a lease option and offset agreements, accounting for about one billion BGN for the aircraft alone ($834 million), while the US/Portuguese bid accounted a price of about one and a half billion BGN for the aircraft alone. The decision pended Bulgarian parliamentary approval. The second-place offer was retained as a back-up option if negotiations with Saab failed; finances for the program were budgeted until the end of 2017. The fighters would replace both the &lt;a href=\"MiG-29\"&gt;MiG-29&lt;/a&gt; fighters of &lt;a href=\"Graf%20Ignatievo%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Graf Ignatievo Air Base&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Su-25\"&gt;Su-25&lt;/a&gt; attack aircraft of &lt;a href=\"Bezmer%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Bezmer Air Base&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the already retired &lt;a href=\"Su-22\"&gt;Su-22&lt;/a&gt; reconnaissance aircraft.\nIn October 2018, potential suppliers responded to a renewed tender for aircraft, consisting of new &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon%20variants%23F-16V%20Viper\"&gt;F-16V Viper&lt;/a&gt; aircraft from Lockheed Martin, new &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet\"&gt;F/A-18E/F Super Hornet&lt;/a&gt; aircraft from Boeing, used &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; aircraft from Italy and used Saab JAS 39 Gripen C/D from Sweden. France, Germany, Israel and Portugal did not respond to requests for used Eurofighter Typhoons and F-16 variants.\nIn December 2018, Saab submitted an improved offer to supply 10 new Gripen C/Ds instead of the previously proposed 8. However, in December 2018, the Bulgarian Ministry of Defence selected the US offer for 8 &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon%20variants%23F-16V%20Viper\"&gt;F-16V&lt;/a&gt; for an estimated 1.8 billion lev ($1.05 billion) as the preferred option, and recommended the government start talks with the US.\nOn 3 June 2019, the U.S. State Department approved the possible sale of 8 F-16 aircraft to Bulgaria. The cost of the contract was estimated at $1.67 billion. On 10 July 2019, Bulgaria approved the acquisition of eight F-16V Block 70/72 fighters for US$1.25bn.\nThe deal was vetoed by the Bulgarian President, &lt;a href=\"Rumen%20Radev\"&gt;Rumen Radev&lt;/a&gt; on 23 July 2019, citing the need to find a broader consensus for the deal, sending the deal back to parliament. On 26 July the deal was again approved by parliament, overruling the veto, and was approved by Radev.\nIn April 2020, &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin\"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt; was contracted by the U.S. government to produce F-16Vs for Bulgaria, estimated to be completed in 2027.\nCroatia.\nOn 24 October 2015, Sweden announced its Gripen C/D bid for Croatia's fighter replacement requirement, following a request for information from the &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20Ministry%20of%20Defence\"&gt;Croatian Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; in June for between 8 and 12 new-build aircraft to replace Croatia's fleet of &lt;a href=\"MiG-21\"&gt;MiG-21&lt;/a&gt;bis aircraft. The LTDP would run from 2015 to 2024 and was scheduled to have funding available for a replacement aircraft in 2019. On 29 March 2018, the Croatian government chose Israel's bid of 12 F-16C/D Barak 2020 fighters over the Gripen; this sale was halted in January 2019 after the US failed to approve Israel's sale of the modified aircraft to Croatia. Sweden submitted another response in September 2020 following a second RFP identifying Croatia's requirements issued in the spring of 2020 for twelve fighters. The second RFP opened up the competition to both new and secondhand aircraft. On 28 May 2021, the Prime Minister of Croatia &lt;a href=\"Andrej%20Plenkovi%C4%87\"&gt;Andrej Plenkovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; announced that the Croatian Government will buy 12 used French Rafale F3R fighters for &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Croatian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nDenmark.\nIn 2007, Denmark signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the Defence Ministers of Sweden and Denmark to evaluate the Gripen as a replacement for Denmark's fleet of 48 &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon\"&gt;F-16s&lt;/a&gt;. Denmark also requested the development of Gripen variants featuring more powerful engines, larger payloads, longer range, and additional avionics; this request contributed to Saab's decision to proceed with the JAS E/F's development. Denmark repeatedly delayed the purchase decision; in 2013, Saab indicated that the Gripen was one of four contenders for the Danish purchase, alongside Boeing's &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet\"&gt;Super Hornet&lt;/a&gt;, Lockheed Martin's &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II\"&gt;F-35 Joint Strike Fighter&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter&lt;/a&gt;. Denmark is a level-3 partner in the JSF programme, and has already invested US$200 million. The final selection was to be in mid-2015 where an order for 24 to 30 fighters was expected. The Swedish government announced on 21 July 2014 the Gripen's withdrawal from the Danish competition, having chosen not to respond to the invitation to tender. In May 2016, Denmark announced the intention to purchase 27 F-35 fighters.\nOn 9 June 2016, the Danish defence committee agreed to purchase 27 F-35As to replace its F-16s for US$3 billion. In May 2019, Danish &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28Denmark%29\"&gt;Minister of Defence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Claus%20Hjort%20Frederiksen\"&gt;Claus Hjort Frederiksen&lt;/a&gt; stated that Denmark is considering stationing fighter jets in Greenland to counter Russia's expanding military presence in the Arctic region. In an additional interview with &lt;a href=\"Ritzau\"&gt;Ritzau&lt;/a&gt;, the minister said that to provide air defense of Greenland would require at least four fighter planes, which would require Denmark to make an additional purchase. In January 2020, Lockheed Martin announced that assembly had begun on L-001, the first of 27 F-35As destined for the Royal Danish Air Force.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"DR%20%28broadcaster%29\"&gt;DR&lt;/a&gt; (Danish public-service) USA spied on the other contenders, the Danish ministries and defense industry to gain advantage in the procurement process.\nFinland.\nThe Gripen's first export bid was to Finland, where it competed against F-16, F/A-18, MiG-29 and Mirage 2000 to replace Finnish Air Force's J 35 Draken and MiG-21 fleet. In May 1992, McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C/D was announced as a winner on performance and cost grounds. The Finnish Minister of Defence, &lt;a href=\"Elisabeth%20Rehn\"&gt;Elisabeth Rehn&lt;/a&gt;, stated that delays in Gripen's development schedule had hurt its chances in the competition.\nIn June 2015, a working group set up by the Finnish MoD proposed starting a program to replace the Finnish Air Force's current F/A-18 Hornet fleet; it recognized five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35, and Saab Gripen. In December 2015, the Finnish MoD sent a letter to Britain, France, Sweden and the US, informing them that the &lt;a href=\"HX%20Fighter%20Program\"&gt;HX Fighter Program&lt;/a&gt; had launched to replace the Hornet with multi-role fighters by around 2025; the letter mentioned the Gripen as a potential fighter. A Request for Information (RFI) for the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016, and five responses were received by November 2016; an official request for quotations will be sent to all five manufacturers that responded to the RFI in early 2018.\nOn 29 January 2020, the Gripen E prototype 39-10 landed at &lt;a href=\"Tampere%E2%80%93Pirkkala%20Airport\"&gt;Tampere\u2013Pirkkala Airport&lt;/a&gt; to participate in HX Challenge, the Finnish HX fighter procurement programme's flight evaluations. It was later followed by Gripen NG demonstrator 39-7 (sensor testbed), while a &lt;a href=\"GlobalEye\"&gt;GlobalEye&lt;/a&gt; participated in the trials from Link\u00f6ping in Sweden. Saab announced they had successfully completed the planned tests to demonstrate the capabilities of Gripen and GlobalEye. On 31 January 2020 Saab submitted a revised offer in response to the revised Request for Quotation for the Finnish HX programme and follow-on BAFO activity anticipated to continue through April 2021. The down selected is scheduled to occur in 2021.\nSaab has submitted its Best and Final Offer (BAFO) for the HX Fighter Program that includes 64 JAS-39Es with an option for JAS-39Fs, two GlobalEye AEW&amp;C and extensive weapons package. More than 20% of the proposal price relating to Gripen is for weapons, such as &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28missile%29\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"IRIS-T\"&gt;IRIS-T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KEPD%20350\"&gt;KEPD 350&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"SPEAR%203\"&gt;SPEAR&lt;/a&gt;, EAJP (Electronic Attack Jammer Pod), and LADM (Lightweight Air-launched Decoy Missile).\nOn 5 December 2021, the Finnish newspaper Iltalehti reported that several foreign and security policy sources stated the Finnish Defense Forces recommendation for the F-35 as Finland's next fighter. These sources pointed to the F-35's capability and expected long lifespan as key reasons. On 10 December 2021, the selection of Lockheed Martin's F-35A was officially confirmed by the Finnish government.\nNetherlands.\nIn July 2008, the Netherlands announced it would evaluate Gripen NG together with four other competitors; in response, Saab offered 85 aircraft to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Netherlands%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Netherlands Air Force&lt;/a&gt; in August 2008. On 18 December 2008, it was reported that the Netherlands had evaluated the F-35 as having a better performance-price relation than the Gripen NG. On 13 January 2009, \"&lt;a href=\"NRC%20Handelsblad\"&gt;NRC Handelsblad&lt;/a&gt;\" claimed that, according to Swedish sources, Saab had offered to deliver 85 Gripens for \u20ac4.8\u00a0billion to the Dutch Air Force, about 1\u00a0billion euro cheaper than budgeted for the F-35.\nNorway.\nOn 18 January 2008, the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Ministry%20of%20Defence\"&gt;Norwegian Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; issued a Request for Binding Information (RBI) to the Swedish Defence Material Administration, who issued an offer for 48 Gripens in April 2008. On 20 November 2008, the selection of the &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II\"&gt;F-35 Lightning II&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Norwegian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Norwegian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; was announced, stating that the F-35 is the only candidate to meet all operational requirements; media reports claimed the requirements were tilted in the F-35's favour. Saab and Sweden's defence minister &lt;a href=\"Sten%20Tolgfors\"&gt;Sten Tolgfors&lt;/a&gt; stated that Norway's cost calculations were flawed; the offer being for 48 Gripens over 20 years, but Norway had extrapolated it to operating 57 aircraft over 30 years, thus doubling the cost; cost projections also failed to relate to the Gripen's operational costs. Norway also calculated greater attrition losses than what Sweden considered reasonable. According to Tolgfors, Norway's decision complicated further export deals.\nIn December 2010 &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20diplomatic%20cables%20leak\"&gt;leaked United States diplomatic cables&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the United States deliberately delayed Sweden's request for access to a US AESA radar until after Norway's selection. The cables also indicated that Norwegian consideration of the Gripen \"was just a show\" and that Norway had decided to purchase the F-35 due to \"high-level political pressure\" from the US.\nPakistan.\nPakistan was interested in the Gripen C/D, but it was denied by Sweden in 2004.\nPoland.\nThe Gripen C/D was a contender for 48 multirole fighters for the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Polish Air Force&lt;/a&gt; started in 2001. On 27 December 2002, the Polish Defence Minister announced the &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon\"&gt;F-16C/D Block 50/52+&lt;/a&gt;'s selection. According to Stephen Larrabee, the selection was heavily influenced by &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin\"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt;'s lucrative &lt;a href=\"offset%20agreement\"&gt;offset agreement&lt;/a&gt; (totaling $3.5 billion and 170% offset against Gripen International's \u20ac3.2 billion with 146% offset) and by a political emphasis on Poland's strategic relationship with the US and NATO. Both Gripen International and Dassault Aviation (who offered the &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Mirage%202000\"&gt;Mirage 2000&lt;/a&gt;-5 Mk 2) described the decision as political. According to a former Polish military defence vice-minister, the JAS 39 offer was better and included research participation proposals.\nIn 2014, Poland planned to purchase 64 multirole combat aircraft from 2021 as part of its modernisation plans to replace the ageing fleet of &lt;a href=\"Sukhoi%20Su-17\"&gt;Sukhoi Su-22M4 'Fitter-K'&lt;/a&gt; ground attack aircraft and &lt;a href=\"Mikoyan%20MiG-29\"&gt;Mikoyan MiG-29 'Fulcrum-A'&lt;/a&gt; fighters. On 23 November 2017, the Armament Inspectorate announced it was starting the acquisition process. By 22 December 2017, five entities had expressed interest in the potential procurement, referred to as \"Harpia\" (harpy eagle), including: Saab AB with Gripen NG, Lockheed Martin with F-35, Boeing Company with F/A-18, Leonardo SpA with Eurofighter Typhoon and Fights-On Logistics with second hand F-16s. In May 2019, the Polish Defense Ministry formally requested to buy 32 F-35A for $4 billion with delivery from 2023 to 2026 with an option for 32 more from 2027.\nSlovakia.\nOn 30 August 2014, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Sweden signed a letter of intent agreeing to co-operate on using the Gripen, which might lead to its acquisition by the &lt;a href=\"Slovak%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Slovak Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. The letter of intent laid the foundation for bilateral co-operation around a common airspace surveillance of Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Slovakia sought to replace its &lt;a href=\"MiG-29\"&gt;MiG-29&lt;/a&gt; fighters and the Gripen has been reported as the aircraft of choice, although the requirement would go to open competition. They may seek to lease fighters rather than buy, as did neighbouring Hungary and the Czech Republic.\nIn February 2018, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Slovakia%29\"&gt;Slovak Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; announced the launch of a new study to examine bids from the US and Swedish governments for the &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon%20variants%23F-16V%20Viper\"&gt;F-16V Viper&lt;/a&gt; and the Gripen to replace Slovakian MiG-29s. On 11 July 2018, the Slovakian Defense ministry announced that it will purchase 14 F-16V Block 70/72s instead of Gripen Cs. The F-16V package includes ammunition, training and logistics for a total of \u20ac1.589 billion (US$1.85 billion). Political opposition, among them former Defence Minister \u013dubom\u00edr Galko, expressed criticism that the deal lacked transparency.\nOn December 12, 2018, Slovakia signed a contract to acquire 14 &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon\"&gt;F-16 Block 70/72&lt;/a&gt;. All are to be delivered by the end of 2023.\nSwitzerland.\nIn January 2008, the Swiss Defence Material Administration invited Gripen International to bid to replace the nation's &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20F-5\"&gt;F-5&lt;/a&gt; fleet. Saab responded with an initial proposal on 2 July 2008; other contenders were the Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon. On 30 November 2011, the Swiss government announced its decision to buy 22 Gripen NG aircraft for 3.1 billion Swiss francs. In 2012, a confidential report of the &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Swiss Air Force&lt;/a&gt;'s 2009 tests of the three contenders was leaked, which had rated the Gripen as performing substantially below both the Rafale and the Eurofighter. The Gripen was assessed as satisfactory for reconnaissance but unsatisfactory for &lt;a href=\"combat%20air%20patrol\"&gt;combat air patrol&lt;/a&gt; and strike missions. The JAS 39C/D was evaluated, while the Gripen NG was bid. The parliamentary security commission found that the Gripen offered the most risks, but voted to go ahead as it was the cheapest option. The Gripen was considered satisfactory in all roles.\nOn 25 August 2012, the plan to order was confirmed by both Swedish and Swiss authorities. Deliveries were expected to run from 2018 to 2021 at a fixed price of CHF 3.126 billion (US$3.27 billion) including development costs, mission planning systems, initial spares and support, training, and certification; the Swedish government also guaranteed the price, performance and operational suitability. 8 JAS 39Cs and 3 JAS 39Ds were to be leased from 2016 to 2020 to train Swiss pilots and allow the F-5s to be retired. In 2013, Saab moved to increase Swiss industry offsets above 100% of the deal value after the Swiss parliament's upper house voted down the deal's financing. On 27 August 2013, the National Council's Security Commission approved the purchase, followed by the lower and upper houses of the parliament's approval in September 2013. Elements of the left and center of the political spectrum often criticized the Gripen as unnecessary and too expensive. On 18 May 2014, 53.4% of Swiss voters voted against the plan in a national &lt;a href=\"referendum\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt;. Reportedly, objectors questioned the role of fighter aircraft in general, and the relevance of alternatives such as &lt;a href=\"UAV\"&gt;UAV&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"surface-to-air%20missile\"&gt;surface-to-air missile&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"cyberwarfare\"&gt;cyberwarfare&lt;/a&gt; capabilities.\nIn 2015, Switzerland was set to relaunch the F-5E/F, and now also F/A-18C/D, replacement programme; the Gripen was again considered the favourite. In March 2018, Swiss officials named contenders in its Air 2030 programme that includes not only combat aircraft but also ground-based air defense systems: The Gripen, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-35. In January 2019, Saab submitted a formal proposal for 30 to 40 Gripen Es to &lt;a href=\"Armasuisse\"&gt;Armasuisse&lt;/a&gt;. It was due to perform evaluation flights for Swiss personnel at &lt;a href=\"Payerne%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Payerne Air Base&lt;/a&gt; in June 2019. However, in June 2019, Saab did not participate at Payerne with the Gripen E because it was not considered ready to perform all tests.\nOthers.\nThe Gripen was one of the candidates to replace the Austrian Air Force's ageing &lt;a href=\"Saab%2035%20Draken\"&gt;Saab 35 Draken&lt;/a&gt;s; the &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; was selected in 2003, but is being considered again due to costs.\nThe Swedish government decided not to enter the Belgian contest.\nOman ended up with the Eurofighter Typhoon.\nRomania decided to acquire used F-16s instead.\nThe Gripen was one of the aircraft evaluated by the Chilean Air Force in 1999. Chile finally selected the F-16 over the Gripen, Boeing F/A-18, and Dassault Mirage 2000\u20135.\nThere were plans to begin &lt;a href=\"licensed%20production\"&gt;licensed production&lt;/a&gt; of the Gripen in &lt;a href=\"Lviv\"&gt;Lviv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. However, these plans have stalled since 2014.\nOperators.\nThere are Gripens in service as of 2016.\nAccidents and incidents.\n, Gripen aircraft have been involved in at least 10 incidents, including nine &lt;a href=\"Aviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents\"&gt;hull-loss accidents&lt;/a&gt;, with one loss of life.\nThe first two crashes, in 1989 and 1993 respectively, occurred during public displays of the Gripen and resulted in considerable negative media reports. The first crash was filmed by a &lt;a href=\"Sveriges%20Television\"&gt;Sveriges Television&lt;/a&gt; news crew and led to critics calling for development to be cancelled. The second crash occurred in an empty area on the island of &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A5ngholmen\"&gt;L\u00e5ngholmen&lt;/a&gt; during the 1993 &lt;a href=\"Stockholm%20Water%20Festival\"&gt;Stockholm Water Festival&lt;/a&gt; with tens of thousands of spectators present. The decision to display the Gripen over large crowds was publicly criticized, and was compared to the 1989 crash. Both the 1989 and 1993 crashes were related to flight control software issues and &lt;a href=\"pilot-induced%20oscillation\"&gt;pilot-induced oscillation&lt;/a&gt; (PIO); the flight control system was corrected by 1995. The first and only fatal crash occurred on 14 January 2017 at &lt;a href=\"Hat%20Yai%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Hat Yai International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, Thailand, during an airshow for Thai Children's Day; the pilot did not survive. The last crash occurred on 21 August 2018 at &lt;a href=\"Kallinge\"&gt;Kallinge Airport&lt;/a&gt; near the southern Swedish town of &lt;a href=\"Ronneby\"&gt;Ronneby&lt;/a&gt;; the pilot was able to successfully eject from the aircraft. The following investigation by the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Accident%20Investigation%20Authority\"&gt;Swedish Accident Investigation Authority&lt;/a&gt; led to the conclusion by DNA analysis of the engine that it collided with &lt;a href=\"Great%20cormorant\"&gt;Phalacrocorax carbo&lt;/a&gt; birds at a speed of and height ."
