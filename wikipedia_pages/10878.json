    "text": "Flanders (, ; &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;: \"Vlaanderen\" ; &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;: \"Flandre\" ; &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;: \"Flandern\" ) is the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;-speaking northern portion of &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and one of the &lt;a href=\"communities%2C%20regions%20and%20language%20areas%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;communities, regions and language areas of Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics, and history, and sometimes involving neighbouring countries. The &lt;a href=\"demonym\"&gt;demonym&lt;/a&gt; associated with Flanders is &lt;a href=\"Flemings\"&gt;Fleming&lt;/a&gt;, while the corresponding adjective is &lt;a href=\"Flemish\"&gt;Flemish&lt;/a&gt;. The official capital of Flanders is the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Brussels\"&gt;City of Brussels&lt;/a&gt;, although the &lt;a href=\"Brussels-Capital%20Region\"&gt;Brussels-Capital Region&lt;/a&gt; has an independent regional government. The government of Flanders only oversees the community aspects of Flanders life in Brussels, such as Flemish culture and education.\nFlanders, despite not being the biggest part of &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; by area, is the area with the largest population (68.2%) if Brussels is included. 7,797,611 out of 11,431,406 Belgian inhabitants live in Flanders or the bilingual &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; region. Only about 8% of Brussels inhabitants identify as Flemish, while the rest identify as French-speaking. Not including Brussels, there are five present-day Flemish provinces.\nIn medieval contexts, the original \"&lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Flanders\"&gt;County of Flanders&lt;/a&gt;\" stretched around AD 900 from the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Dover\"&gt;Strait of Dover&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Scheldt\"&gt;Scheldt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"estuary\"&gt;estuary&lt;/a&gt; and expanded from there. This county also still corresponds roughly with the modern-day Belgian provinces of &lt;a href=\"West%20Flanders\"&gt;West Flanders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Flanders\"&gt;East Flanders&lt;/a&gt;, along with neighbouring parts of &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. Although this original meaning is still relevant, in modern times the term \"Flanders\" came to refer to a larger area, and is used to refer to the entire Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, stretching all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Meuse\"&gt;Meuse&lt;/a&gt;, as well as cultural movements such as &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20art\"&gt;Flemish art&lt;/a&gt;. In accordance with late 20th century &lt;a href=\"state%20reform%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;Belgian state reforms&lt;/a&gt; the Belgian part of this area was made into two political entities: the \"&lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Community\"&gt;Flemish Community&lt;/a&gt;\" () and the \"&lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Region\"&gt;Flemish Region&lt;/a&gt;\" (). These entities were merged, although geographically the Flemish Community, which has a broader cultural mandate, covers Brussels, whereas the Flemish Region does not.\nThe area of today's Flanders, by every definition, has figured prominently in European history since the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. In this period, cities such as &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bruges\"&gt;Bruges&lt;/a&gt; of the historic &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Flanders\"&gt;County of Flanders&lt;/a&gt;, and later &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Brabant\"&gt;Duchy of Brabant&lt;/a&gt; made it one of the richest and most urbanised parts of Europe, trading, and weaving the &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a very sophisticated culture developed, with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture, rivaling those of &lt;a href=\"northern%20Italy\"&gt;northern Italy&lt;/a&gt;. Belgium was one of the centres of the 19th-century &lt;a href=\"industrial%20revolution\"&gt;industrial revolution&lt;/a&gt;, but Flanders was at first overtaken by French-speaking &lt;a href=\"Wallonia\"&gt;Wallonia&lt;/a&gt;. In the second half of the 20th century, and due to massive national investments in port infrastructure, Flanders' economy modernised rapidly, and today Flanders and Brussels are much wealthier than Wallonia. They are among the wealthiest regions in Europe and the world.\nGeographically, Flanders is mainly flat, and has a small section of coast on the North Sea. Much of Flanders is agriculturally fertile and densely populated, with a density of . It touches the &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; department of &lt;a href=\"Nord%20%28French%20department%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest near the coast, and borders the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; provinces of &lt;a href=\"Zeeland\"&gt;Zeeland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Brabant\"&gt;North Brabant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Limburg%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;Limburg&lt;/a&gt; to the north and east, and the &lt;a href=\"Wallonia\"&gt;Walloon&lt;/a&gt; provinces of &lt;a href=\"Hainaut%20Province\"&gt;Hainaut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walloon%20Brabant\"&gt;Walloon Brabant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Li%C3%A8ge%20Province\"&gt;Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt; to the south. The &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Capital%20Region\"&gt;Brussels Capital Region&lt;/a&gt; is an officially bilingual &lt;a href=\"enclave\"&gt;enclave&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Region\"&gt;Flemish Region&lt;/a&gt;. Flanders has exclaves of its own: &lt;a href=\"Voeren\"&gt;Voeren&lt;/a&gt; in the east is between Wallonia and the Netherlands and &lt;a href=\"Baarle-Hertog\"&gt;Baarle-Hertog&lt;/a&gt; in the north consists of 22 exclaves surrounded by the Netherlands.\nTerminology.\nModern Belgium.\nThe term \"Flanders\" has several main modern meanings:\nHistorical.\nThe name originally applied to the \"&lt;a href=\"ancien%20r%C3%A9gime\"&gt;ancien r\u00e9gime&lt;/a&gt;\" territory called the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Flanders\"&gt;County of Flanders&lt;/a&gt;, that existed from the 8th century (Latin \"Flandria\") until its absorption by the &lt;a href=\"French%20First%20Republic\"&gt;French First Republic&lt;/a&gt;. Until the 1600s, this county also extended over parts of what are now France and the Netherlands. \nEspecially in international discussions, the significance of the County of Flanders and its &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Flanders\"&gt;counts&lt;/a&gt; eroded over time, but the designation was used for a bigger territory. \"Flanders\" (and Latin \"Belgium\") were the first two common names used for the &lt;a href=\"Burgundian%20Netherlands\"&gt;Burgundian Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. With the breakaway of the northern Netherlands in the &lt;a href=\"Early%20modern%20period\"&gt;Early modern period&lt;/a&gt;, the term Flanders continued to be associated with the whole southern part of the &lt;a href=\"Low%20Countries\"&gt;Low Countries&lt;/a&gt; \u2015 the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Netherlands\"&gt;Southern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Netherlands\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Netherlands\"&gt;Austrian Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, which were the successors of the Burgundian state, and predecessors of modern Belgium.\nDutch-speaking part of Belgium.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, it became increasingly common to refer more specifically to the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium as \"Flanders\". The linguistic limit between French and Dutch was recorded in the early '60s, from &lt;a href=\"Kortrijk\"&gt;Kortrijk&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Maastricht\"&gt;Maastricht&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Flanders extends over the northern part of Belgium, including not only the Dutch-speaking Belgian parts of the medieval &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Brabant\"&gt;Duchy of Brabant&lt;/a&gt;, which was united with Flanders since the Middle Ages, but also &lt;a href=\"Limburg%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Belgian Limburg&lt;/a&gt;, which corresponds closely to the medieval &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Loon\"&gt;County of Loon&lt;/a&gt;, which was never under Burgundian control.\nThe ambiguity between this wider cultural area and that of the County or Province still remains in discussions about the region. In most present-day contexts, however, the term Flanders is taken to refer to either the political, social, cultural, and linguistic community (and the corresponding official institution, the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Community\"&gt;Flemish Community&lt;/a&gt;), or the geographical area, one of the three institutional regions in Belgium, namely the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Region\"&gt;Flemish Region&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20art\"&gt;history of art&lt;/a&gt; and other fields, the adjectives Flemish and &lt;a href=\"Netherlandish\"&gt;Netherlandish&lt;/a&gt; are commonly used to designate all the artistic production in this area before about 1580, after which it refers specifically to the southern Netherlands. For example, the term \"Flemish Primitives\", now outdated in English but used in French, Dutch and other languages, is a synonym for \"&lt;a href=\"Early%20Netherlandish%20painting\"&gt;Early Netherlandish painting&lt;/a&gt;\", and it is not uncommon to see &lt;a href=\"Mosan%20art\"&gt;Mosan art&lt;/a&gt; categorized as Flemish art. In music the \"&lt;a href=\"Franco-Flemish%20School\"&gt;Franco-Flemish School&lt;/a&gt;\" is also known as the \"Dutch School\".\nWithin this Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, French has never ceased to be spoken by some citizens and Jewish groups have been speaking &lt;a href=\"Yiddish\"&gt;Yiddish&lt;/a&gt; in Antwerp for centuries. Today, Flanders' minority residents include 170 nationalities\u2014the largest groups speaking &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berber%20languages\"&gt;Berber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Polish%20language\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Caesar\"&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/a&gt; conquered the area he described it as the less economically developed and more warlike part of \"&lt;a href=\"Gallia%20Belgica\"&gt;Gallia Belgica&lt;/a&gt;\". His informants told him that especially in the east, the tribes claimed ancestral connections and kinship with the &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20peoples\"&gt;\"Germanic\" peoples&lt;/a&gt; then east of the &lt;a href=\"Rhine\"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt;. Under the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20empire\"&gt;Roman empire&lt;/a&gt; the whole of \"Gallia Belgica\" became an administrative province. The future counties of Flanders and Brabant remained part of this province connected to what is now France, but in the east modern Limburg became part of the Rhine frontier province of \"&lt;a href=\"Germania%20Inferior\"&gt;Germania Inferior&lt;/a&gt;\" connected to what is now the Netherlands and Germany. \"Gallia Belgica\" and \"Germania Inferior\" were the two most northerly continental provinces of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20empire\"&gt;Roman empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the future county of Flanders, the main &lt;a href=\"Belgic%20tribe\"&gt;Belgic tribe&lt;/a&gt; in early Roman times was the &lt;a href=\"Menapii\"&gt;Menapii&lt;/a&gt;, but also on the coast were the &lt;a href=\"Marsacii\"&gt;Marsacii&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morini\"&gt;Morini&lt;/a&gt;. In the central part of modern Belgium were the &lt;a href=\"Nervii\"&gt;Nervii&lt;/a&gt; and in the east were the &lt;a href=\"Tungri\"&gt;Tungri&lt;/a&gt;. The Tungri especially were understood to have links to Germanic tribes east of the Rhine. Another notable Germanic group were the &lt;a href=\"Toxandrians\"&gt;Toxandrians&lt;/a&gt; who appear to have lived in the &lt;a href=\"Campine\"&gt;Kempen&lt;/a&gt; region, in the northern parts of both the Nervian and Tungrian provinces, probably stretching into the modern Netherlands. The Roman administrative districts (\"&lt;a href=\"civitas\"&gt;civitates&lt;/a&gt;\") of the Menapii, Nervii and Tungri therefore corresponded roughly with the medieval counties of Flanders, Brabant and &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Loon\"&gt;Loon&lt;/a&gt;, and the modern Flemish provinces of East and West Flanders (Menapii), Brabant and Antwerp (the northern Nervii), and Belgian Limburg (Tungri). Brabant appears to have been home to relatively unpopulated forest area, the &lt;a href=\"Silva%20Carbonaria\"&gt;Silva Carbonaria&lt;/a&gt;, forming a natural boundary between northeast and southwest Belgium.\nLinguistically, the tribes in this area were under &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20languages\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; influence in the south, and &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20languages\"&gt;Germanic&lt;/a&gt; influence in the east, but there is disagreement about what languages were spoken locally (apart from &lt;a href=\"Vulgar%20Latin\"&gt;Vulgar Latin&lt;/a&gt;), and there may even have been an intermediate \"&lt;a href=\"Nordwestblock\"&gt;Nordwestblock&lt;/a&gt;\" language related to both. By the first century BC, &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20languages\"&gt;Germanic languages&lt;/a&gt; had become prevalent.\nAs Roman influence waned, Frankish populations settled east of the Silva Carbonaria, and eventually pushed through it under &lt;a href=\"Chlodio\"&gt;Chlodio&lt;/a&gt;. They had kings in each city (\"civitas\"). In the meantime, the Franks contributed to the Roman military. The first Merovingian king &lt;a href=\"Childeric%20I\"&gt;Childeric I&lt;/a&gt; was king of the Franks in the military, who became leader of the administration of \"Belgica Secunda\", which included the \"civitas\" of the Menapii (the future county of Flanders). From there, his son &lt;a href=\"Clovis%20I\"&gt;Clovis I&lt;/a&gt; managed to conquer both the Roman populations of northern France and the Frankish populations beyond the forest areas.\nHistorical Flanders.\nThe County of Flanders was a &lt;a href=\"feudal\"&gt;feudal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fief\"&gt;fief&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"West%20Francia\"&gt;West Francia&lt;/a&gt;. The first certain Count in the comital family, &lt;a href=\"Baldwin%20I%20of%20Flanders\"&gt;Baldwin I of Flanders&lt;/a&gt;, is first reported in a document of 862 when he eloped with a daughter of his king &lt;a href=\"Charles%20the%20Bald\"&gt;Charles the Bald&lt;/a&gt;. The region developed as a medieval economic power with a large degree of political autonomy. While its trading cities remained strong, it was weakened and divided when districts fell under direct French royal rule in the late 12th century. The remaining parts of Flanders came under the rule of the counts of neighbouring imperial &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Hainaut\"&gt;Hainaut&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Baldwin%20V%20of%20Hainaut\"&gt;Baldwin V of Hainaut&lt;/a&gt; in 1191.\nDuring the late &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; Flanders' trading towns (notably &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bruges\"&gt;Bruges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ypres\"&gt;Ypres&lt;/a&gt;) made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe, weaving the &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a sophisticated culture developed, with impressive art and architecture, rivaling those of northern Italy. Ghent, Bruges, Ypres and the &lt;a href=\"Franc%20of%20Bruges\"&gt;Franc of Bruges&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Members\"&gt;Four Members&lt;/a&gt;, a form of parliament that exercised considerable power in Flanders.\nIncreasingly powerful from the 12th century, the territory's autonomous urban &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20commune\"&gt;communes&lt;/a&gt; were instrumental in defeating a French attempt at annexation (1300\u20131302), finally defeating the French in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Golden%20Spurs\"&gt;Battle of the Golden Spurs&lt;/a&gt; (11 July 1302), near &lt;a href=\"Kortrijk\"&gt;Kortrijk&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later, the &lt;a href=\"Franco-Flemish%20War%20%281297-1305%29\"&gt;uprising was defeated&lt;/a&gt; and Flanders indirectly remained part of the French Crown. Flemish prosperity waned in the following century, due to widespread European population decline following the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Death\"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt; of 1348, the disruption of trade during the Anglo-French &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years' War&lt;/a&gt; (1337\u20131453), and increased English cloth production. Flemish weavers had gone over to &lt;a href=\"Worstead\"&gt;Worstead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Walsham\"&gt;North Walsham&lt;/a&gt; in Norfolk in the 12th century and established the woolen industry.\nThe County of Flanders started to take control of the neighbouring &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Brabant\"&gt;County of Brabant&lt;/a&gt; during the life of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders\"&gt;Louis II, Count of Flanders&lt;/a&gt; (1330-1384), who fought his sister-in-law &lt;a href=\"Joanna%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Brabant\"&gt;Joanna, Duchess of Brabant&lt;/a&gt; for control of it.\nThe entire area, straddling the ancient boundary of France and the Holy Roman Empire, later passed to &lt;a href=\"Philip%20the%20Bold\"&gt;Philip the Bold&lt;/a&gt; in 1384, the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;Duke of Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;, with his capital in &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. The titles were eventually more clearly united under his grandson &lt;a href=\"Philip%20the%20Good\"&gt;Philip the Good&lt;/a&gt; (1396 \u2013 1467). This large Duchy passed in to the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg\"&gt;Habsburg&lt;/a&gt; dynasty, and in &lt;a href=\"%26lt%3B%21--Charles%20V%20abdicated--%26gt%3BPhilip%20II%20of%20Spain\"&gt;1556&lt;/a&gt; to the kings of Spain. Western and southern districts of Flanders were confirmed under French rule under successive treaties of &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Pyrenees\"&gt;1659&lt;/a&gt; (Artois), &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Aix-la-Chapelle%20%281668%29\"&gt;1668&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Treaties%20of%20Nijmegen\"&gt;1678&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe County of Loon, approximately the modern Flemish province of Limburg, remained independent of France, forming a part of the &lt;a href=\"Prince-Bishopric%20of%20Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt; until the French Revolution, but surrounded by the Burgundians, and under their influence.\nLow Countries.\nBeeldenstorm.\nIn 1500, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt; was born in &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;. He inherited the &lt;a href=\"Seventeen%20Provinces\"&gt;Seventeen Provinces&lt;/a&gt; (1506), Spain (1516) with its colonies and in 1519 was elected &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Charles V issued the &lt;a href=\"Pragmatic%20Sanction%20of%201549\"&gt;Pragmatic Sanction of 1549&lt;/a&gt;, which established the Low Countries as the Seventeen Provinces (or &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Netherlands\"&gt;Spanish Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in its broad sense) as an entity separate from the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and from France. In 1556 Charles V abdicated due to ill health (he suffered from crippling &lt;a href=\"gout\"&gt;gout&lt;/a&gt;). Spain and the Seventeen Provinces went to his son, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Philip II of Spain&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the first half of the 16th century &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt; grew to become the second-largest European city north of the &lt;a href=\"Alps\"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt; by 1560. Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nMeanwhile, Protestantism had reached the Low Countries. Among the wealthy traders of Antwerp, the &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; beliefs of the German &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20%28class%29\"&gt;Hanseatic&lt;/a&gt; traders found appeal, perhaps partly for economic reasons. The spread of Protestantism in this city was aided by the presence of an &lt;a href=\"Augustinians\"&gt;Augustinian&lt;/a&gt; cloister (founded 1514) in the St. Andries quarter. Luther, an Augustinian himself, had taught some of the monks, and his works were in print by 1518. The first Lutheran martyrs came from Antwerp. The &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt; resulted in consecutive but overlapping waves of reform: a Lutheran, followed by a militant &lt;a href=\"Anabaptist\"&gt;Anabaptist&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"Mennonite\"&gt;Mennonite&lt;/a&gt;, and finally a &lt;a href=\"Calvinism\"&gt;Calvinistic&lt;/a&gt; movement. These movements existed independently of each other.\n&lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Philip II&lt;/a&gt;, a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the &lt;a href=\"Counter-Reformation\"&gt;Counter-Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"suppression%20of%20dissent\"&gt;suppressed&lt;/a&gt; Calvinism in Flanders, &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Brabant\"&gt;Brabant&lt;/a&gt; and Holland (what is now approximately &lt;a href=\"Limburg%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Belgian Limburg&lt;/a&gt; was part of the &lt;a href=\"Prince-Bishopric%20of%20Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt; and was Catholic \"de facto\"). In 1566, the wave of &lt;a href=\"iconoclasm\"&gt;iconoclasm&lt;/a&gt; known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Beeldenstorm\"&gt;Beeldenstorm&lt;/a&gt;\" was a prelude to religious war between Catholics and Protestants, especially the Anabaptists. The \"Beeldenstorm\" started in what is now &lt;a href=\"French%20Flanders\"&gt;French Flanders&lt;/a&gt;, with open-air sermons () that spread through the Low Countries, first to Antwerp and Ghent, and from there further east and north.\nThe Eighty Years' War and its consequences.\nSubsequently, Philip II of Spain sent &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20%C3%81lvarez%20de%20Toledo%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Alba\"&gt;the Duke&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Alba\"&gt;Alba&lt;/a&gt; to the Provinces to repress the revolt. Alba recaptured the southern part of the Provinces, who signed the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Arras\"&gt;Union of Atrecht&lt;/a&gt;, which meant that they would accept the Spanish government on condition of more freedom. But the northern part of the provinces signed the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Utrecht\"&gt;Union of Utrecht&lt;/a&gt; and settled in 1581 the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20the%20Seven%20United%20Netherlands\"&gt;Republic of the Seven United Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. Spanish troops quickly started fighting the rebels, and the Spanish armies conquered the important trading cities of Bruges and Ghent. Antwerp, which was then the most important port in the world, also had to be conquered. But before the revolt was defeated, a war between Spain and England broke out, forcing Spanish troops to halt their advance. On 17 August 1585, Antwerp fell. This ended the Eighty Years' War for the (from now on) &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Netherlands\"&gt;Southern Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Republic\"&gt;United Provinces&lt;/a&gt; (the Northern Netherlands) fought on until 1648 \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20of%20Westphalia\"&gt;Peace of Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the war with England, the rebels from the north, strengthened by refugees from the south, started a campaign to reclaim areas lost to &lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Philip II&lt;/a&gt;'s Spanish troops. They conquered a considerable part of Brabant (the later &lt;a href=\"North%20Brabant\"&gt;North Brabant&lt;/a&gt; of the Netherlands), and the south bank of the Scheldt estuary (&lt;a href=\"Zeelandic%20Flanders\"&gt;Zeelandic Flanders&lt;/a&gt;), before being stopped by Spanish troops. The front at the end of this war stabilized and became the border between present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The Dutch (as they later became known) had managed to reclaim enough of Spanish-controlled Flanders to close off the river &lt;a href=\"Scheldt\"&gt;Scheldt&lt;/a&gt;, effectively cutting Antwerp off from its trade routes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"fall%20of%20Antwerp\"&gt;fall of Antwerp&lt;/a&gt; to the Spanish and the closing of the &lt;a href=\"Scheldt\"&gt;Scheldt&lt;/a&gt; caused considerable emigration. Many Calvinist merchants of Antwerp and other Flemish cities left Flanders and migrated north. Many of them settled in &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam\"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;, which was a smaller port, important only in the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20trade\"&gt;Baltic trade&lt;/a&gt;. The Flemish exiles helped to rapidly transform Amsterdam into one of the world's most important ports. This is why the exodus is sometimes described as \"creating a new Antwerp\".\nFlanders and Brabant, went into a period of relative decline from the time of the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years War&lt;/a&gt;. In the Northern Netherlands, the mass emigration from Flanders and Brabant became an important driving force behind the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Golden%20Age\"&gt;Dutch Golden Age&lt;/a&gt;.\nSouthern Netherlands (1581\u20131795).\nAlthough arts remained relatively impressive for another century with &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Paul%20Rubens\"&gt;Peter Paul Rubens&lt;/a&gt; (1577\u20131640) and &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20van%20Dyck\"&gt;Anthony van Dyck&lt;/a&gt;, Flanders lost its former economic and intellectual power under Spanish, Austrian, and French rule. Heavy taxation and rigid imperial political control compounded the effects of industrial stagnation and Spanish-Dutch and Franco-Austrian conflict. The Southern Netherlands suffered severely under the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession\"&gt;War of the Spanish Succession&lt;/a&gt;. But under the reign of Empress Maria-Theresia, these lands again flourished economically. Influenced by &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;the Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;, the Austrian Emperor &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Joseph II&lt;/a&gt; was the first sovereign who had been in the Southern Netherlands since King Philip II of Spain left them in 1559.\nFrench Revolution and Napoleonic France (1795\u20131815).\nIn 1794, the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20France%23Revolution\"&gt;French Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; started using Antwerp as the northernmost naval port of France. The following year, France officially annexed Flanders as the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20130%20d%C3%A9partements\"&gt;d\u00e9partements&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Lys%20%28d%C3%A9partement%29\"&gt;Lys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Escaut%20%28d%C3%A9partement%29\"&gt;Escaut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deux-N%C3%A8thes\"&gt;Deux-N\u00e8thes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meuse-Inf%C3%A9rieure\"&gt;Meuse-Inf\u00e9rieure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dyle%20%28d%C3%A9partement%29\"&gt;Dyle&lt;/a&gt;. Obligatory (French) army service for all men aged 16\u201325 years was a main reason for the uprising against the French in 1798, known as the \"Boerenkrijg\" (\"Peasants' War\"), with the heaviest fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Campine\"&gt;Campine&lt;/a&gt; area.\nUnited Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815\u20131830).\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt; at the 1815 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Waterloo\"&gt;Battle of Waterloo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Brabant\"&gt;Brabant&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; (1815) gave sovereignty over the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Netherlands\"&gt;Austrian Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Belgium minus the &lt;a href=\"East%20Cantons\"&gt;East Cantons&lt;/a&gt; and Luxembourg \u2013 to the &lt;a href=\"Sovereign%20Principality%20of%20the%20United%20Netherlands\"&gt;United Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch: \"Verenigde Nederlanden\") under Prince William I of Orange Nassau, making him &lt;a href=\"William%20I%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;William I of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. William I started rapid industrialisation of the southern parts of the Kingdom. But the political system failed to forge a true union between the north and south. Most of the southern &lt;a href=\"bourgeoisie\"&gt;bourgeoisie&lt;/a&gt; was Roman Catholic and French-speaking, while the north was mainly Protestant and Dutch-speaking.\nIn 1815, the Dutch Senate was reinstated (Dutch: \"Eerste Kamer der Staaten Generaal\"). The nobility, mainly coming from the south, became more and more estranged from their northern colleagues. Resentment grew between the Roman Catholics from the south and the Protestants from the north, and also between the powerful liberal bourgeoisie from the south and their more moderate colleagues from the north. On 25 August 1830 (after the showing of the opera '&lt;a href=\"La%20Muette%20de%20Portici\"&gt;La Muette de Portici&lt;/a&gt;' of &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Auber\"&gt;Daniel Auber&lt;/a&gt; in Brussels) the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20Revolution\"&gt;Belgian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; sparked. On 4 October 1830, the &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20Government%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;Provisional Government&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch: \"Voorlopig Bewind\") proclaimed its independence, which was later confirmed by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Congress%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;National Congress&lt;/a&gt; that issued a new Liberal Constitution and declared the new state a &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20Monarchy\"&gt;Constitutional Monarchy&lt;/a&gt;, under the House of &lt;a href=\"Saxe-Coburg\"&gt;Saxe-Coburg&lt;/a&gt;. Flanders now became part of the Kingdom of Belgium, which was recognized by the major European Powers on 20 January 1831. The cessation was recognized by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;United Kingdom of the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; on 19 April 1839.\nKingdom of Belgium.\nIn 1830, the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20Revolution\"&gt;Belgian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; led to the splitting up of the two countries. Belgium was confirmed as an independent state by the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20London%2C%201839\"&gt;Treaty of London&lt;/a&gt; of 1839, but deprived of the eastern half of Limburg (now Dutch Limburg), and the Eastern half of Luxembourg (now the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg). Sovereignty over &lt;a href=\"Zeelandic%20Flanders\"&gt;Zeelandic Flanders&lt;/a&gt;, south of the &lt;a href=\"Westerscheldt\"&gt;Westerscheldt&lt;/a&gt; river delta, was left with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which was allowed to levy a toll on all traffic to Antwerp harbour until 1863.\nRise of the Flemish Movement.\nIn 1873, Dutch became an official language in public secondary schools. In 1898, Dutch and French were declared equal languages in laws and Royal orders. In 1930 the first Flemish university was opened.\nThe first official translation of the Belgian constitution in Dutch was not published until 1967.\nWorld War I and its consequences.\nFlanders (and Belgium as a whole) saw some of the greatest loss of life on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, in particular from the three battles of &lt;a href=\"Ypres\"&gt;Ypres&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe war strengthened Flemish identity and consciousness. The occupying German authorities took several Flemish-friendly measures. The resulting suffering of the war is remembered by Flemish organizations during the yearly &lt;a href=\"Ijzerbedevaart\"&gt;Yser pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Diksmuide\"&gt;Diksmuide&lt;/a&gt; at the monument of the &lt;a href=\"IJzertoren\"&gt;Yser Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nRight-Wing Nationalism in the interbellum and World War II.\nDuring the interbellum and World War II, several right-wing fascist and/or national-socialistic parties emerged in Belgium. Since these parties were promised more rights for the Flemings by the German government during World War II, many of them collaborated with the Nazi regime. After the war, collaborators (or people who were \"Zwart\", \"Black\" during the war) were prosecuted and punished, among them many Flemish Nationalists whose main political goal had been the emancipation of Flanders. As a result, until today Flemish Nationalism is often associated with right-wing and sometimes fascist ideologies.\nFlemish autonomy.\nAfter World War II, the differences between Dutch-speaking and French-speaking Belgians became clear in a number of conflicts, such as the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Question\"&gt;Royal Question&lt;/a&gt;, the question whether King Leopold III should return (which most Flemings supported but Walloons did not) and the use of Dutch in the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20University%20of%20Leuven%20%281834%E2%80%931968%29\"&gt;Catholic University of Leuven&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, several &lt;a href=\"State%20reform%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;state reforms&lt;/a&gt; took place in the second half of the 20th century, which transformed the unitary Belgium into a federal state with &lt;a href=\"Communities%2C%20regions%20and%20language%20areas%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;communities, regions and language areas&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted also in the establishment of a &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Parliament\"&gt;Flemish Parliament&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Government\"&gt;Government&lt;/a&gt;. During the 1970s, all major political parties split into a Dutch and French-speaking party.\nSeveral Flemish parties still advocate for more Flemish autonomy, some even for Flemish independence (see &lt;a href=\"Partition%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;Partition of Belgium&lt;/a&gt;), whereas the French-speakers would like to keep the current state as it is. Recent governments (such as &lt;a href=\"Verhofstadt%20I%20Government\"&gt;Verhofstadt I Government&lt;/a&gt;) have transferred certain federal competences to the regional governments.\nOn 13 December 2006, a &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Secession%20hoax\"&gt;spoof news broadcast&lt;/a&gt; by the Belgian Francophone public broadcasting station &lt;a href=\"RTBF\"&gt;RTBF&lt;/a&gt; announced that Flanders had decided to declare independence from Belgium.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20federal%20election%2C%202007\"&gt;2007 federal elections&lt;/a&gt; showed more support for Flemish autonomy, marking the start of the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%932011%20Belgian%20political%20crisis\"&gt;2007\u20132011 Belgian political crisis&lt;/a&gt;. All the political parties that advocated a significant increase of Flemish autonomy gained votes as well as seats in the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20federal%20parliament\"&gt;Belgian federal parliament&lt;/a&gt;. This was especially the case for &lt;a href=\"Christen-Democratisch%20en%20Vlaams\"&gt;Christian Democratic and Flemish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Flemish%20Alliance\"&gt;New Flemish Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (N-VA) (who had participated on a shared &lt;a href=\"electoral%20list\"&gt;electoral list&lt;/a&gt;). The trend continued during the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20regional%20elections%2C%202009\"&gt;2009 regional elections&lt;/a&gt;, where CD&amp;V and N-VA were the clear winners in Flanders, and N-VA became even the largest party in Flanders and Belgium during the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20federal%20election%2C%202010\"&gt;2010 federal elections&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%932011%20Belgian%20government%20formation\"&gt;longest-ever government formation&lt;/a&gt; after which the &lt;a href=\"Di%20Rupo%20I%20Government\"&gt;Di Rupo I Government&lt;/a&gt; was formed excluding N-VA. Eight parties agreed on a &lt;a href=\"Sixth%20Belgian%20state%20reform\"&gt;sixth state reform&lt;/a&gt; which aim to solve the disputes between Flemings and French-speakers. However, the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20provincial%20and%20municipal%20elections%2C%202012\"&gt;2012 provincial and municipal elections&lt;/a&gt; continued the trend of N-VA becoming the biggest party in Flanders.\nHowever, sociological studies show no parallel between the rise of nationalist parties and popular support for their agenda. Instead, a recent study revealed a majority in favour of returning regional competences to the federal level.\nGovernment and politics.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Community\"&gt;Flemish Community&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Region\"&gt;Flemish Region&lt;/a&gt; are constitutional institutions of the Kingdom of Belgium, exercising certain powers within their jurisdiction, granted following a series of &lt;a href=\"state%20reform%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;state reforms&lt;/a&gt;. In practice, the Flemish Community and Region together form a single body, with its own &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Parliament\"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Government\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;, as the Community legally absorbed the competences of the Region. The parliament is a directly elected legislative body composed of 124 representatives. The government consists of up to 11 members and is presided by a &lt;a href=\"Minister-President%20of%20Flanders\"&gt;Minister-President&lt;/a&gt;, currently &lt;a href=\"Geert%20Bourgeois\"&gt;Geert Bourgeois&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"New%20Flemish%20Alliance\"&gt;New Flemish Alliance&lt;/a&gt;) leading a coalition of his party (N-VA) with &lt;a href=\"Christen-Democratisch%20en%20Vlaams\"&gt;Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams&lt;/a&gt; (CD&amp;V) and &lt;a href=\"Open%20Vlaamse%20Liberalen%20en%20Democraten\"&gt;Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten&lt;/a&gt; (Open VLD).\nThe area of the Flemish Community is represented on the maps above, including the area of the &lt;a href=\"Brussels-Capital%20Region\"&gt;Brussels-Capital Region&lt;/a&gt; (hatched on the relevant map). Roughly, the Flemish Community exercises competences originally oriented towards the individuals of the Community's language: culture (including audiovisual media), &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;, and the use of the language. Extensions to personal matters less directly associated with language comprise sports, health policy (curative and preventive medicine), and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, immigrant assistance services, etc.)\nThe area of the Flemish Region is represented on the maps above. It has a population of more than 6 million (excluding the Dutch-speaking community in the Brussels Region, grey on the map for it is not a part of the Flemish Region). Roughly, the Flemish Region is responsible for territorial issues in a broad sense, including economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit, and foreign trade. It supervises the provinces, municipalities, and intercommunal utility companies.\nThe number of Dutch-speaking &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20people\"&gt;Flemish people&lt;/a&gt; in the Capital Region is estimated to be between 11% and 15% (official figures do not exist as there is no language census and no official subnationality). According to a survey conducted by the &lt;a href=\"Universit%C3%A9%20catholique%20de%20Louvain\"&gt;University of Louvain&lt;/a&gt; (UCLouvain) in &lt;a href=\"Louvain-la-Neuve\"&gt;Louvain-la-Neuve&lt;/a&gt; and published in June 2006, 51% of respondents from Brussels claimed to be bilingual, even if they do not have Dutch as their first language. They are governed by the Brussels Region for economics affairs and by the Flemish Community for educational and cultural issues.\nAs mentioned above, Flemish institutions such as the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Parliament\"&gt;Flemish Parliament&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Government\"&gt;Government&lt;/a&gt;, represent the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region. The region and the community thus \"de facto\" share the same parliament and the same government. All these institutions are based in Brussels. Nevertheless, both types of subdivisions (the Community and the Region) still exist legally and the distinction between both is important for the people living in Brussels. Members of the Flemish Parliament who were elected in the Brussels Region cannot vote on affairs belonging to the competences of the Flemish Region.\nThe &lt;a href=\"official%20language\"&gt;official language&lt;/a&gt; for all Flemish institutions is &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;. French enjoys a limited official recognition in &lt;a href=\"municipalities%20with%20language%20facilities\"&gt;a dozen municipalities&lt;/a&gt; along the borders with French-speaking &lt;a href=\"Wallonia\"&gt;Wallonia&lt;/a&gt;, and a large recognition in the bilingual Brussels Region. French is widely known in Flanders, with 59% claiming to know French according to a survey conducted by &lt;a href=\"Universit%C3%A9%20catholique%20de%20Louvain\"&gt;UCLouvain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Louvain-la-Neuve\"&gt;Louvain-la-Neuve&lt;/a&gt; and published in June 2006.\nPolitics.\nHistorically, the political parties reflected the &lt;a href=\"pillarisation\"&gt;pillarisation&lt;/a&gt; (\"verzuiling\") in Flemish society. The traditional political parties of the three pillars are &lt;a href=\"Christian-Democratic%20and%20Flemish\"&gt;Christian-Democratic and Flemish&lt;/a&gt; (CD&amp;V), the &lt;a href=\"Open%20Flemish%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats\"&gt;Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (Open Vld) and the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Party%20%E2%80%93%20Differently\"&gt;Socialist Party \u2013 Differently&lt;/a&gt; (sp.a).\nHowever, during the last half century, many new political parties were founded in Flanders. One of the first was the nationalist &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Union%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;People's Union&lt;/a&gt;, of which the right nationalist &lt;a href=\"Vlaams%20Blok\"&gt;Flemish Block&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Vlaams%20Belang\"&gt;Flemish Interest&lt;/a&gt;) split off, and which later dissolved into the now-defunct Spirit or &lt;a href=\"Social%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Social Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;, moderate nationalism rather left of the spectrum, on the one hand, and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Flemish%20Alliance\"&gt;New Flemish Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (N-VA), more conservative but independentist, on the other hand. Other parties are the leftist alternative/ecological &lt;a href=\"Groen%21\"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt; party; the short-lived anarchistic libertarian spark &lt;a href=\"ROSSEM\"&gt;ROSSEM&lt;/a&gt; and more recently the conservative-right liberal &lt;a href=\"Lijst%20Dedecker\"&gt;List Dedecker&lt;/a&gt;, founded by &lt;a href=\"Jean-Marie%20Dedecker\"&gt;Jean-Marie Dedecker&lt;/a&gt;, and the socialist &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nParticularly the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Block\"&gt;Flemish Block&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Interest\"&gt;Flemish Interest&lt;/a&gt; has seen electoral success roughly around the turn of the century, and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Flemish%20Alliance\"&gt;New Flemish Alliance&lt;/a&gt; during the last few elections, even becoming the largest party in the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20federal%20election%2C%202010\"&gt;2010 federal elections&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlemish independence.\nFor some inhabitants, Flanders is more than just a geographical area or the federal institutions (Flemish Community and Region). Supporters of the Flemish Movement even call it a nation and pursue Flemish independence, but most people (approximately 75%) living in Flanders say they are proud to be Belgian and opposed to the dissolution of Belgium. 20% is even \"very proud\", while some 25% are not proud and 8% is \"very not proud\". Mostly students claim to be proud of their nationality, with 90% of them saying so. Of the people older than 55, 31% claim to be proud of being a Belgian. Particular opposition to secession comes from women, people employed in &lt;a href=\"Service%20%28economics%29\"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt;, the highest social classes and people from big families. Strongest of all opposing the notion are housekeepers\u2014both housewives and house husbands.\nIn 2012, the Flemish government drafted a \"Charter for Flanders\" (\"Handvest voor Vlaanderen\") of which the first article says \"Vlaanderen is een deelstaat van de federale Staat Belgi\u00eb en maakt deel uit van de Europese Unie.\" (\"Flanders is a &lt;a href=\"federated%20state\"&gt;component state&lt;/a&gt; of the federal State of Belgium and is part of the European Union\"). Although interpreted by many Flemish nationalists as a statement, this phrase is merely a quotation from the Belgian constitution and has no further legal value whatsoever.\nGeography.\nFlanders shares its borders with Wallonia in the south, Brussels being an enclave within the Flemish Region. The rest of the border is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Zeelandic%20Flanders\"&gt;Zeelandic Flanders&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zeeland\"&gt;Zeeland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Brabant\"&gt;North Brabant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Limburg%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;Limburg&lt;/a&gt;) in the north and east, and with &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"French%20Flanders\"&gt;French Flanders&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hauts-de-France\"&gt;Hauts-de-France&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; in the west. &lt;a href=\"Voeren\"&gt;Voeren&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"exclave\"&gt;exclave&lt;/a&gt; of Flanders between Wallonia and the Netherlands, while &lt;a href=\"Baarle-Hertog\"&gt;Baarle-Hertog&lt;/a&gt; in Flanders forms a complicated series of enclaves and exclaves with &lt;a href=\"Baarle-Nassau\"&gt;Baarle-Nassau&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands. &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, although bordering Wallonia and close to &lt;a href=\"Voeren\"&gt;Voeren&lt;/a&gt; in Limburg, does not share a border with Flanders. The &lt;a href=\"German-speaking%20Community%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;German-speaking Community of Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, also close to Voeren, does not border Flanders either. (The commune of &lt;a href=\"Plombi%C3%A8res\"&gt;Plombi\u00e8res&lt;/a&gt;, majority French speaking, lies between them.)\nFlanders is a highly urbanised area, lying completely within the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Banana\"&gt;Blue Banana&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bruges\"&gt;Bruges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leuven\"&gt;Leuven&lt;/a&gt; are the largest cities of the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Region\"&gt;Flemish Region&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt; has a population of more than 500,000 citizens and is the largest city, &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt; has a population of 250,000 citizens, followed by &lt;a href=\"Bruges\"&gt;Bruges&lt;/a&gt; with 120,000 citizens and &lt;a href=\"Leuven\"&gt;Leuven&lt;/a&gt; counts almost 100,000 citizens.\n&lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; is a part of Flanders as far as community matters are concerned, but does not belong to the Flemish Region.\nFlanders has two main geographical regions: the coastal &lt;a href=\"Yser\"&gt;Yser&lt;/a&gt; basin plain in the north-west and a central plain. The first consists mainly of sand dunes and &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;ey &lt;a href=\"alluvial\"&gt;alluvial&lt;/a&gt; soils in the &lt;a href=\"polder\"&gt;polder&lt;/a&gt;s. Polders are areas of land, close to or below sea level that have been reclaimed from the sea, from which they are protected by &lt;a href=\"dike%20%28construction%29\"&gt;dikes&lt;/a&gt; or, a little further inland, by fields that have been drained with canals. With similar soils along the lowermost &lt;a href=\"Scheldt\"&gt;Scheldt&lt;/a&gt; basin starts the central plain, a smooth, slowly rising fertile area irrigated by many waterways that reaches an average height of about five metres (16.4\u00a0ft) above sea level with wide valleys of its rivers upstream as well as the &lt;a href=\"Campine\"&gt;Campine&lt;/a&gt; region to the east having sandy soils at altitudes around thirty metres. Near its southern edges close to &lt;a href=\"Wallonia\"&gt;Wallonia&lt;/a&gt; one can find slightly rougher land, richer in &lt;a href=\"calcium\"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;, with low hills reaching up to and small valleys, and at the eastern border with the Netherlands, in the &lt;a href=\"Meuse\"&gt;Meuse&lt;/a&gt; basin, there are &lt;a href=\"marl\"&gt;marl&lt;/a&gt; caves (\"mergelgrotten\"). Its &lt;a href=\"exclave\"&gt;exclave&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Voeren\"&gt;Voeren&lt;/a&gt; between the Dutch border and &lt;a href=\"Wallonia\"&gt;Wallonia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Li%C3%A8ge%20Province\"&gt;Li\u00e8ge Province&lt;/a&gt; attains a maximum altitude of above sea level.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe present-day &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Region\"&gt;Flemish Region&lt;/a&gt; covers and is divided into &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;five provinces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrondissements%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;22 arrondissements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20municipalities%20of%20the%20Flemish%20Region\"&gt;308 cities or municipalities&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe province of Flemish Brabant is the most recently created, being formed in 1995 after the splitting of the &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20Brabant\"&gt;province of Brabant&lt;/a&gt; on a linguistic basis.\nMost municipalities are made up of several former municipalities, now called \"&lt;a href=\"deelgemeente\"&gt;deelgemeente&lt;/a&gt;n\". The largest municipality (both in terms of population and area) is &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;, having more than half a million inhabitants. Its nine \"deelgemeenten\" have a special status and are called &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Antwerp\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt;, which have an elected council and a college. While any municipality with more than 100,000 inhabitants can establish districts, only Antwerp did this so far. The smallest municipality (also both in terms of population and area) is &lt;a href=\"Herstappe\"&gt;Herstappe&lt;/a&gt; (Limburg).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Community\"&gt;Flemish Community&lt;/a&gt; covers both the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Region\"&gt;Flemish Region&lt;/a&gt; and, together with the French Community, the &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels-Capital Region&lt;/a&gt;. Brussels, an enclave within the province of Flemish Brabant, is not divided into any province nor is it part of any. It coincides with the &lt;a href=\"Arrondissement%20of%20Brussels-Capital\"&gt;Arrondissement of Brussels-Capital&lt;/a&gt; and includes &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20municipalities%20of%20the%20Brussels-Capital%20Region\"&gt;19 municipalities&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Government\"&gt;Flemish Government&lt;/a&gt; has its own local institutions in the Brussels-Capital Region, being the \"&lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Community%20Commission\"&gt;Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie&lt;/a&gt;\" (VGC), and its municipal antennae (\"Gemeenschapscentra\", community centres for the Flemish community in Brussels). These institutions are independent from the educational, cultural and social institutions that depend directly on the Flemish Government. They exert, among others, all those cultural competences that outside Brussels fall under the provinces.\nClimate.\nThe climate is maritime &lt;a href=\"temperate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt;, with significant precipitation in all seasons (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt;: \"Cfb\"; the average temperature is in January, and in July; the average precipitation is 65\u00a0millimetres (2.6\u00a0in) in January, and 78\u00a0millimetres (3.1\u00a0in) in July).\nEconomy.\nTotal GDP of the Flemish Region in 2018 was \u20ac270 billion (&lt;a href=\"Eurostat\"&gt;Eurostat&lt;/a&gt; figures). Per capita GDP at &lt;a href=\"purchasing%20power%20parity\"&gt;purchasing power parity&lt;/a&gt; was 20% above the EU average. Flemish productivity per capita is about 13% higher than that in &lt;a href=\"Wallonia\"&gt;Wallonia&lt;/a&gt;, and wages are about 7% higher than in Wallonia.\nFlanders was one of the first continental European areas to undergo the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, in the 19th century. Initially, the modernization relied heavily on food processing and textile. However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis and there was famine in Flanders (1846\u201350). After World War II, &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt; experienced a fast expansion of the &lt;a href=\"chemical\"&gt;chemical&lt;/a&gt; and petroleum industries. Flanders also attracted a large majority of foreign investments in Belgium. The &lt;a href=\"1973%20oil%20crisis\"&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1979%20oil%20crisis\"&gt;1979 oil crises&lt;/a&gt; sent the economy into a recession. The steel industry remained in relatively good shape. In the 1980s and 90s, the economic centre of Belgium continued to shift further to Flanders and is now concentrated in the populous &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Diamond\"&gt;Flemish Diamond&lt;/a&gt; area. Nowadays, the Flemish economy is mainly service-oriented.\nBelgium is a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Coal%20and%20Steel%20Community\"&gt;European Coal and Steel Community&lt;/a&gt; in 1951, which evolved into the present-day &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999, the &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;, the single European currency, was introduced in Flanders. It replaced the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20franc\"&gt;Belgian franc&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.\nThe Flemish economy is strongly export-oriented, in particular of high value-added goods. The main imports are food products, machinery, rough diamonds, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, clothing and accessories, and textiles. The main exports are automobiles, food and food products, iron and steel, finished diamonds, textiles, plastics, petroleum products, and non-ferrous metals. Since 1922, Belgium and Luxembourg have been a single trade market within a &lt;a href=\"customs%20union\"&gt;customs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"currency%20union\"&gt;currency union&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Belgium%E2%80%93Luxembourg%20Economic%20Union\"&gt;Belgium\u2013Luxembourg Economic Union&lt;/a&gt;. Its main trading partners are Germany, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States, and Spain.\nAntwerp is the number one diamond market in the world, diamond exports account for roughly 1/10 of Belgian exports. The Antwerp-based &lt;a href=\"BASF\"&gt;BASF&lt;/a&gt; plant is the largest BASF-base outside Germany, and accounts on its own for about 2% of Belgian exports. Other industrial and service activities in Antwerp include car manufacturing, telecommunications, photographic products.\nFlanders is home to several science and technology institutes, such as &lt;a href=\"IMEC\"&gt;IMEC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Institute%20for%20Technological%20Research\"&gt;VITO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flanders%20DC\"&gt;Flanders DC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flanders%20Make\"&gt;Flanders Make&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfrastructure.\nFlanders has developed an extensive transportation infrastructure of ports, canals, railways and highways. The &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Antwerp\"&gt;Port of Antwerp&lt;/a&gt; is the second-largest in Europe, after &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Rotterdam\"&gt;Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;. Other ports are &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Bruges-Zeebrugge\"&gt;Bruges-Zeebrugge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Ostend\"&gt;Ostend&lt;/a&gt;, of which Zeebrugge and Ostend are located at the .\nWhereas railways are managed by the federal &lt;a href=\"National%20Railway%20Company%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;National Railway Company of Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, other public transport (&lt;a href=\"De%20Lijn\"&gt;De Lijn&lt;/a&gt;) and roads are managed by the Flemish region.\nThe main airport is &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Airport\"&gt;Brussels Airport&lt;/a&gt;, the only other civilian airport with scheduled services in Flanders is &lt;a href=\"Antwerp%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Antwerp International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, but there are two other ones with cargo or charter flights: &lt;a href=\"Ostend-Bruges%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Ostend-Bruges International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kortrijk-Wevelgem%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Kortrijk-Wevelgem International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, both in West Flanders.\nDemographics.\nThe highest population density is found in the area circumscribed by the &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Leuven\"&gt;Leuven&lt;/a&gt; agglomerations that surround Mechelen and is known as the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Diamond\"&gt;Flemish Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, in other important urban centres as &lt;a href=\"Bruges\"&gt;Bruges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roeselare\"&gt;Roeselare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kortrijk\"&gt;Kortrijk&lt;/a&gt; to the west, and notable centres &lt;a href=\"Turnhout\"&gt;Turnhout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hasselt\"&gt;Hasselt&lt;/a&gt; to the east. On 1 January 2015, the Flemish Region had a population of 6,444,127 and about 15% of the 1,175,173 people in the Brussels Region are also considered Flemish.\nReligion.\nThe Belgian constitution provides for &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20of%20religion%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;freedom of religion&lt;/a&gt;, and the various governments in general respect this right in practice. Since independence, &lt;a href=\"Catholicism\"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;, counterbalanced by strong &lt;a href=\"freethought\"&gt;freethought&lt;/a&gt; movements, has had an important role in Belgium's politics, since the 20th century in Flanders mainly via the Christian trade union &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20Christian%20Trade%20Unions\"&gt;ACV&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Christen-Democratisch%20en%20Vlaams\"&gt;Christian Democratic and Flemish&lt;/a&gt; party (CD&amp;V). According to the \"2001 Survey and Study of Religion\", about 47 percent of the Belgian population identify themselves as belonging to the Catholic Church, while Islam is the second-largest religion at 3.5 percent. A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, considered more religious than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious, and 36% believed that God created the world.\nJews &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;have been present&lt;/a&gt; in Flanders for a long time, in particular &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Antwerp\"&gt;in Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, Muslims have immigrated to Flanders, now forming the largest minority religion with about 3.9% in the Flemish Region and 25% in Brussels. The largest Muslim group is Moroccan in origin, while the second largest is Turkish in origin.\nEducation.\nEducation is compulsory from the ages of six to 18, but most &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20people\"&gt;Flemings&lt;/a&gt; continue to study until around 23. Among the &lt;a href=\"Organisation%20for%20Economic%20Co-operation%20and%20Development\"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&lt;/a&gt; countries in 1999, Flanders had the third-highest proportion of 18- to 21-year-olds enrolled in &lt;a href=\"postsecondary%20education\"&gt;postsecondary education&lt;/a&gt;. Flanders also scores very high in international comparative studies on education. Its secondary school students consistently rank among the top three for mathematics and science. However, the success is not evenly spread: ethnic minority youth score consistently lower, and the difference is larger than in most comparable countries.\nMirroring the historical political conflicts between the secular and Catholic segments of the population, the Flemish educational system is split into a secular branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a &lt;a href=\"subsidy\"&gt;subsidised&lt;/a&gt; religious\u2014mostly Catholic\u2014branch. For the subsidised schools, the main costs such as the teacher's wages and building maintenance completely borne by the Flemish government. Subsidised schools are also free to determine their own teaching and examination methods, but in exchange, they must be able to prove that certain minimal terms are achieved by keeping records of the given lessons and exams. It should however be noted that\u2014at least for the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20school\"&gt;Catholic school&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools, neither do the schools have a lot of power on their own. Instead, the Catholic schools are a member of the Catholic umbrella organisation . The VSKO determines most practicalities for schools, like the advised schedules per study field. However, there's freedom of education in Flanders, which doesn't only mean that every pupil can choose his/her preferred school, but also that every organisation can found a school, and even be subsidised when abiding the different rules. This resulted also in some smaller school systems follow 'methodical pedagogies' (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Waldorf%20education\"&gt;Steiner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Montessori\"&gt;Montessori&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Freinet\"&gt;Freinet&lt;/a&gt;) or serve the Jewish and Protestant minorities.\nDuring the school year 2003\u20132004, 68.30% of the total population of children between the ages of six and 18 went to subsidized private schools (both religious schools or 'methodical pedagogies' schools).\nThe big freedom given to schools results in a constant competition to be the \"best\" school. The schools get certain reputations amongst parents and employers. So it's important for schools to be the best school since the subsidies depend on the number of pupils. This competition has been pinpointed as one of the main reasons for the high overall quality of the Flemish education. However, the importance of a school's reputation also makes schools more eager to expel pupils that don't perform well. Resulting in the ethnic differences and the well-known waterfall system: pupils start high in the perceived hierarchy, and then drop towards more professional oriented directions or \"easier\" schools when they can't handle the pressure any longer.\nHealthcare.\nHealthcare is a federal matter, but the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Government\"&gt;Flemish Government&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for care, health education and &lt;a href=\"preventive%20care\"&gt;preventive care&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nLanguage and literature.\nThe standard language in Flanders is &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;; spelling and grammar are regulated by a single authority, the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Language%20Union\"&gt;Dutch Language Union&lt;/a&gt; (\"Nederlandse Taalunie\"), comprising a committee of ministers of the Flemish and Dutch governments, their advisory council of appointed experts, a controlling commission of 22 parliamentarians, and a secretariate. The term &lt;a href=\"Flemish\"&gt;Flemish&lt;/a&gt; can be applied to the Dutch spoken in Flanders; it shows many regional and local variations.\nThe biggest difference between Belgian Dutch and Dutch used in the Netherlands is in the pronunciation of words. The Dutch spoken in the north of the Netherlands is typically described as being \"sharper\", while Belgian Dutch is \"softer\". In Belgian Dutch, there are also fewer vowels pronounced as &lt;a href=\"diphthongs\"&gt;diphthongs&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to spelling, Belgian Dutch language purists historically avoided writing words using a French spelling, or searched for specific translations of words derived from French, while the Dutch often retain the French spelling. For example, the Dutch word \"punaise\" (English: \"&lt;a href=\"Drawing%20pin\"&gt;Drawing pin&lt;/a&gt;\") is derived directly from the French language. Belgian Dutch language purists have lobbied to accept the word \"duimspijker\" (literally: \"thumb spike\") as official Dutch, though the Dutch Language Union never accepted it as standard Dutch. Other proposals by purists were sometimes accepted, and sometimes reverted again in later spelling revisions. As language purists were quite often professionally involved in language (e.g. as a teacher), these unofficial purist translations are found more often in Belgian Dutch texts.\nThe earliest example of literature in non-&lt;a href=\"standardized%20dialect\"&gt;standardized dialect&lt;/a&gt;s in the current area of Flanders is &lt;a href=\"Hendrik%20van%20Veldeke\"&gt;Hendrik van Veldeke&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Eneas Romance\", the first courtly romance in a &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20language\"&gt;Germanic language&lt;/a&gt; (12th century). With a writer of &lt;a href=\"Hendrik%20Conscience\"&gt;Hendrik Conscience&lt;/a&gt;'s stature, &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20literature\"&gt;Flemish literature&lt;/a&gt; rose ahead of French literature in Belgium's early history. &lt;a href=\"Guido%20Gezelle\"&gt;Guido Gezelle&lt;/a&gt; not only explicitly referred to his writings as Flemish but used it in many of his poems, and strongly defended it:\nOriginal \n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Gij zegt dat 't vlaamsch te niet zal gaan:\"\n\"'t en zal!\"\n\"dat 't waalsch gezwets zal boven slaan:\"\n\"'t en zal!\"\n\"Dat hopen, dat begeren wij:\"\n\"dat zeggen en dat zweren wij:\"\n\"zoo lange als wij ons weren, wij:\"\n\"'t en zal, 't en zal,\"\n\"'t en zal!\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nTranslation . For explanations, continue along\n\"It shan't!\"\n\"This we hope, for this we hanker:\"\n\"this we say and this we vow:\"\n\"as long as we fight back, we:\"\n\"It shan't, It shan't,\"\n\"It shan't!\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe distinction between &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20literature\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; and Flemish literature, often perceived politically, is also made on intrinsic grounds by some experts such as Kris Humbeeck, professor of Literature at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Antwerp\"&gt;University of Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, most &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch-language&lt;/a&gt; literature read (and appreciated to varying degrees) in Flanders is the same as that in the Netherlands.\nInfluential Flemish writers include &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Claes\"&gt;Ernest Claes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stijn%20Streuvels\"&gt;Stijn Streuvels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Timmermans\"&gt;Felix Timmermans&lt;/a&gt;. Their novels mostly describe rural life in Flanders in the 19th century and at beginning of the 20th. Widely read by the older generations, they are considered somewhat old-fashioned by present-day critics. Some famous Flemish writers of the early 20th century wrote in French, including Nobel Prize winners (1911) &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Maeterlinck\"&gt;Maurice Maeterlinck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emile%20Verhaeren\"&gt;Emile Verhaeren&lt;/a&gt;. They were followed by a younger generation, including &lt;a href=\"Paul%20van%20Ostaijen\"&gt;Paul van Ostaijen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaston%20Burssens\"&gt;Gaston Burssens&lt;/a&gt;, who \"&lt;a href=\"Activism\"&gt;activated&lt;/a&gt;\" the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Movement\"&gt;Flemish Movement&lt;/a&gt;. Still widely read and translated into other languages (including English) are the novels of authors such as &lt;a href=\"Willem%20Elsschot\"&gt;Willem Elsschot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Paul%20Boon\"&gt;Louis Paul Boon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hugo%20Claus\"&gt;Hugo Claus&lt;/a&gt;. The recent crop of writers includes the novelists &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Lanoye\"&gt;Tom Lanoye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herman%20Brusselmans\"&gt;Herman Brusselmans&lt;/a&gt;, and poets such as the married couple &lt;a href=\"Herman%20de%20Coninck\"&gt;Herman de Coninck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kristien%20Hemmerechts\"&gt;Kristien Hemmerechts&lt;/a&gt;.\nLanguages.\nAt the creation of the Belgian state, French was the only official language. Historically Flanders was a Dutch-speaking region. For a long period, French was used as a &lt;a href=\"second%20language\"&gt;second language&lt;/a&gt; and, like elsewhere in Europe, commonly spoken among the aristocracy. There is still a French-speaking minority in Flanders, especially in the &lt;a href=\"municipalities%20with%20language%20facilities\"&gt;municipalities with language facilities&lt;/a&gt;, along the language border and the &lt;a href=\"municipalities%20with%20language%20facilities%23Rim%20municipalities\"&gt;Brussels periphery&lt;/a&gt; (Vlaamse Rand), though many of them are French-speakers that migrated to Flanders in recent decades.\nIn &lt;a href=\"French%20Flanders\"&gt;French Flanders&lt;/a&gt;, French is the only official language and now the native language of the majority of the population, but there is still a minority of Dutch-speakers living there. French is also the primary language in the officially bilingual &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Capital%20Region\"&gt;Brussels Capital Region&lt;/a&gt;, (see &lt;a href=\"Francization%20of%20Brussels\"&gt;Francization of Brussels&lt;/a&gt;).\nMany Flemings are also able to speak French, children in Flanders generally get their first French lessons in the 5th primary year (normally around 10 years). But the current lack of French outside the educational context makes it hard to maintain a decent level of French. As such, the proficiency of French is declining. Flemish pupils are also obligated to follow English lessons as their third language. Normally from the second secondary year (around 14 years old), but the ubiquity of English in movies, music, IT and even advertisements makes it easier to learn and maintain the English language.\nMedia.\nThe public radio and television broadcaster in Flanders is &lt;a href=\"Vlaamse%20Radio-%20en%20Televisieomroeporganisatie\"&gt;VRT&lt;/a&gt;, which operates the TV channels &lt;a href=\"%C3%A9%C3%A9n\"&gt;\u00e9\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canvas%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ketnet\"&gt;Ketnet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"OP12\"&gt;OP12&lt;/a&gt; and (together with the Netherlands) &lt;a href=\"BVN\"&gt;BVN&lt;/a&gt;. Flemish provinces each have up to two TV channels as well. Commercial television broadcasters include &lt;a href=\"VTM%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;vtm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vier\"&gt;Vier&lt;/a&gt; (VT4). Popular TV series are for example \"&lt;a href=\"Thuis\"&gt;Thuis&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"F.C.%20De%20Kampioenen\"&gt;F.C. De Kampioenen&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe five most successful Flemish films were \"&lt;a href=\"Loft%20%282008%20film%29\"&gt;Loft&lt;/a&gt;\" (2008; 1,186,071 visitors), \"&lt;a href=\"Koko%20Flanel\"&gt;Koko Flanel&lt;/a&gt;\" (1990; 1,082,000 tickets sold), \"&lt;a href=\"Hector%20%281987%20film%29\"&gt;Hector&lt;/a&gt;\" (1987; 933,000 tickets sold), \"&lt;a href=\"Daens%20%28film%29\"&gt;Daens&lt;/a&gt;\" (1993; 848,000 tickets sold) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Alzheimer%20Case\"&gt;De Zaak Alzheimer&lt;/a&gt;\" (2003; 750,000 tickets sold). The first and last ones were directed by &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Van%20Looy\"&gt;Erik Van Looy&lt;/a&gt;, and an American remake is being made of both of them, respectively \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Loft%20%282012%20film%29\"&gt;The Loft&lt;/a&gt;\" (2012) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Memory%20of%20a%20Killer\"&gt;The Memory of a Killer&lt;/a&gt;\". The other three ones were directed by &lt;a href=\"Stijn%20Coninx\"&gt;Stijn Coninx&lt;/a&gt;.\nNewspapers are grouped under three main publishers: &lt;a href=\"De%20Persgroep\"&gt;De Persgroep&lt;/a&gt; with \"&lt;a href=\"Het%20Laatste%20Nieuws\"&gt;Het Laatste Nieuws&lt;/a&gt;\", the most popular newspaper in Flanders, \"&lt;a href=\"De%20Morgen\"&gt;De Morgen&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"De%20Tijd\"&gt;De Tijd&lt;/a&gt;\". Then &lt;a href=\"Corelio\"&gt;Corelio&lt;/a&gt; with \"\", the oldest extant Flemish newspaper, \"&lt;a href=\"Het%20Nieuwsblad\"&gt;Het Nieuwsblad&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"De%20Standaard\"&gt;De Standaard&lt;/a&gt;\". Lastly, &lt;a href=\"Concentra\"&gt;Concentra&lt;/a&gt; publishes \"&lt;a href=\"Gazet%20van%20Antwerpen\"&gt;Gazet van Antwerpen&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Het%20Belang%20van%20Limburg\"&gt;Het Belang van Limburg&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMagazines include \"&lt;a href=\"Knack%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Knack&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"HUMO\"&gt;HUMO&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSports.\n&lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;Association football&lt;/a&gt; (soccer) is one of the most popular sports in both parts of Belgium, together with cycling, tennis, swimming and judo.\nIn cycling, the &lt;a href=\"Tour%20of%20Flanders\"&gt;Tour of Flanders&lt;/a&gt; is considered one of the five \"&lt;a href=\"Classic%20cycle%20races\"&gt;Monuments&lt;/a&gt;\".
