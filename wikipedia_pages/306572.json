    "text": "Reinaldo Arenas (July 16, 1943 \u2013 December 7, 1990) was a Cuban &lt;a href=\"poet\"&gt;poet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"novelist\"&gt;novelist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"playwright\"&gt;playwright&lt;/a&gt; known as a critic of &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Castro\"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20Revolution\"&gt;Cuban Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, and a rebel of the &lt;a href=\"Politics%20of%20Cuba\"&gt;Cuban government&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nArenas was born in the countryside of Newport Beach Aguas Claras, &lt;a href=\"Holgu%C3%ADn%20Province\"&gt;Holgu\u00edn Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, and later moved to the city of &lt;a href=\"Holgu%C3%ADn\"&gt;Holgu\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; when he was a teenager. He was 6 when he started school, attending Rural School 91 in Perronales County. In that school, is when his interest in boys flourished. He writes about his sexual exploration with himself and the people around him, even detailing that most of his sexual activity was with animals. He talks openly of the first times he has sex, while incomplete, it was with his cousin, Dulce Maria. He shares that, what he calls the consummated act (meaning mutual penetration), was with his cousin Orlando when he was 8 and his cousin 12. He says, \u201cIn the country, sexual energy generally overcomes all prejudice, repression, and punishment\u2026Physical desire overpowers whatever feelings of machismo our fathers take upon themselves to instill in us.\u201d\nAfter moving to Holgu\u00edn when he was a teen, Arenas got a job at a guava paste factory. When conditions in the city started to get worse, around 1958, he decided that he wanted to join the guerillas (Castro and his movement), by then he was 14. He walked to Velasco where he met Cuco S\u00e1nchez who took him to the rebel headquarters in the Sierra Gibara. A guerilla commander, Eddy Su\u00f1ol, interviewed him. He said, \u201cWe have plenty of guerrillas; what we need is weapons.\u201d After ten days with them, he went back to Holgu\u00edn with the intention of killing a guard and taking his weapon. When he made it back to the city, he went home to see his grandparents who were not so happy to see him. Because he made the mistake of leaving a note saying he was going to join the guerillas, the women that lived with his grandparents spread the news like wildfire. Batista's police were then looking for him. His brief trip home made him realize he couldn't stay so he trekked back to Velasco to the rebel encampment. They had to accept him at that point.\nWhen he was 16, he was awarded a scholarship at La Pantoja, the Batista military camp that had been converted into a polytechnic institute. At the school, one of the most important courses was on Marxism\u2013Leninism. Students had to master the Manual of the USSR Academy of Sciences; Manual of Political Economy by Nikitin; Foundations of Socialism in Cuba by Blas Roca. Arenas graduated as an agricultural accountant, and described his schooling as \"communist indoctrination\".\nThe first time Arenas was in Havana was in 1960. He returned later when he enrolled in a planning course at the University of Havana and reported to the Hotel Nacional. While in the program, he worked for INRA, the National Institute for Agrarian Reform. It wasn't until around 1963 that Arenas started to live his life as a gay man, and even then, it was still a life of extreme repression and privacy. He feared ending up in a UMAP (Military Units for Aid to Production) concentration camp, ones made specifically for LGBT people in Cuba. A relationship with a man named Miguel, who was later arrested and taken to a UMAP, was the beginning of Arenas\u2019 life as an out gay man.\nThroughout his life, Arenas became friends with and had relationships with many gay men. Even going so far to say that at one point, he had had sex with at least 5,000 men. He watched as various friends and acquaintances pledged their allegiance to the regime in exchange for safety. They became informers for the government and reported other men, oftentimes friends and/or people they had relationships with in the past. The intention was to find gay and bisexual men and either prosecute and jail them or turn them into informers too. The reward for cooperating with the regime was your life. In order to become an informer, though, it often meant denouncing your homosexuality publicly \u2013 a very humiliating act. The same thing happened when you were found out to be critical of the regime, you were forced to stand in public and say that you were wrong. Failure to do so would result in death. \nArenas watched this happen with Herberto Padilla. He had written a book that was critical of the Revolution to an official competition. Padilla was arrested in 1971 and after 30 days in a cell, he decided to speak. Various Cuban intellectuals were invited by State Security to hear what he had to say. Padilla stood in front of everyone and apologized for everything he had done. He painted himself as a coward and a traitor, apologizing for his previous work and throwing blame on himself. He publicly denounced his friends and his wife, saying they had counterrevolutionary attitudes. Those he named were forced to go to the microphone and accept blame for their actions and say that they were traitors too. \nIn 1963, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; to enroll in the School of Planification and, later, in the Faculty of Letters at the &lt;a href=\"Universidad%20de%20La%20Habana\"&gt;Universidad de La Habana&lt;/a&gt;, where he studied philosophy and literature without completing a degree. The following year, he began working at the Biblioteca Nacional Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed. During his time working for INRA, he spent a lot of time at the National Library. After writing a short story and presenting it to a committee, he received a telegram that they were interested in talking to him. When he went, he met Mar\u00eda Teresa Freye de Andrade, who was the director of the National Library. She orchestrated Arenas\u2019 move from INRA to the Library. From then on, he was employed there. After Mar\u00eda Teresa lost her job and was replaced by Castro's police, Captain Sidroc Ramos, Arenas decided the Library wasn't where he wanted to be. It was about this time that his talent was noticed, and he received a literary award for his novel, Singing from the Well, at Cirilo Villaverde National Competition held by &lt;a href=\"UNEAC\"&gt;UNEAC&lt;/a&gt; (National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists).\nHis El mundo alucinante (This Hallucinatory World, published in the U.S. as The Ill-Fated Peregrinations of Fray Servando) was awarded \"first Honorable Mention\" in 1966. Although, as the judges could find no better entry and they refused to award it to Arenas, no First Prize was awarded that year. His writings and openly gay life were, by 1967, bringing him into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; government. He left the Biblioteca Nacional and became an editor for the Cuban Book Institute until 1968. From 1968 to 1974 he was a journalist and editor for the literary magazine \"La Gaceta de Cuba\".\nIn 1974, he was sent to prison after being charged and convicted of \"ideological deviation\" and for publishing abroad without official consent. He escaped from prison and tried to leave Cuba by launching himself from the shore on a tire inner tube. The attempt failed and he was rearrested near &lt;a href=\"Parque%20Lenin\"&gt;Lenin Park&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned at the notorious &lt;a href=\"Morro%20Castle%20%28Havana%29\"&gt;El Morro Castle&lt;/a&gt; alongside murderers and rapists. He survived by helping the inmates to write letters to wives and lovers. He was able to collect enough paper this way to continue his writing. However, his attempts to smuggle his work out of prison were discovered and he was severely punished. Threatened with death, he was forced to renounce his work and was released in 1976.\nIn 1980, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Mariel%20Boatlift\"&gt;Mariel Boatlift&lt;/a&gt;, he fled to the United States. He came on the boat \"San L\u00e1zaro\" captained by Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9 Roberto Ag\u00fcero.\nIn 1987, Arenas was diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"AIDS\"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;; he continued to write and speak out against the Cuban government. He mentored many &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20exile\"&gt;Cuban exile&lt;/a&gt; writers, including John O'Donnell-Rosales. After battling AIDS, Arenas died of an intentional overdose of drugs and alcohol on December 7, 1990, in New York City. In a suicide letter written for publication, Arenas wrote: Due to my delicate state of health and to the terrible depression that causes me not to be able to continue writing and struggling for the freedom of Cuba, I am ending my life ... I want to encourage the Cuban people abroad as well as on the Island to continue fighting for freedom. ... Cuba will be free. I already am. In 2012 Arenas was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Walk\"&gt;Legacy Walk&lt;/a&gt;, an outdoor public display which celebrates &lt;a href=\"LGBT\"&gt;LGBT&lt;/a&gt; history and people.\nWritings.\nDespite his short life and the hardships imposed during his imprisonment, Arenas produced a significant body of work. In addition to significant poetic efforts (\"El Central\", \"Leprosorio\"), his \"&lt;a href=\"Pentagonia\"&gt;Pentagonia&lt;/a&gt;\" is a set of five novels that comprise a \"secret history\" of post-revolutionary Cuba. It includes \"Singing from the Well\" (in Spanish also titled \"Celestino before Dawn\"), \"&lt;a href=\"Farewell%20to%20the%20Sea\"&gt;Farewell to the Sea&lt;/a&gt;\" (whose literal translation is \"The Sea Once More\"), \"&lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20White%20Skunks\"&gt;Palace of the White Skunks&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Rabelais\"&gt;Rabelais&lt;/a&gt;ian \"Color of Summer\", and \"The Assault\". In these novels Arenas\u2019 style ranges from a stark realist narrative and high modernist experimental prose to absurd, satiric humor. His second novel, \"Hallucinations\" (\"El Mundo Alucinante\"), rewrites the story of the colonial dissident priest &lt;a href=\"Servando%20Teresa%20de%20Mier\"&gt;Fray Servando Teresa de Mier&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn interviews, his autobiography, and in some of his fiction work itself, Arenas draws explicit connections between his own life experience and the identities and fates of his protagonists. As is evident and as critics such as Francisco Soto have pointed out, the \"child narrator\" in \"Celestino\", Fortunato of \"The Palace...\", Hector of \"Farewell..\", and the triply named \"Gabriel/Reinaldo/Gloomy Skunk\" character in \"Color\" appear to live progressive stages of a continuous life story that is also linked to Arenas's own. In turn, Arenas consistently links his individual narrated life to the historical experience of a generation of Cubans. A constant theme in his novels and other writing is the condemnation of the Castro government, although Arenas also critiques the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, US culture and politics. He also critique a series of literary personalities in Havana and internationally, particularly those who he believed had betrayed him and suppressed his work (&lt;a href=\"Severo%20Sarduy\"&gt;Severo Sarduy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%81ngel%20Rama\"&gt;\u00c1ngel Rama&lt;/a&gt; are notable examples). His \"Thirty truculent tongue-twisters\", which he claims circulated in Havana and which are reprinted in \"The Color of Summer\", mock everyone from personal friends who he suggests may have spied on him to figures such as Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n, Alejo Carpentier, Miguel Barnet, Sarduy and of course Castro himself.\nHis autobiography, \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20Night%20Falls\"&gt;Before Night Falls&lt;/a&gt;\" was on the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" list of the ten best books of the year in 1993. In 2000 this work was made into a &lt;a href=\"Before%20Night%20Falls%20%28film%29\"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;, directed by &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Schnabel\"&gt;Julian Schnabel&lt;/a&gt;, in which Arenas was played by &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Bardem\"&gt;Javier Bardem&lt;/a&gt;. An opera based on the autobiography with libretto and music by Cuban-American composer &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Mart%C3%ADn%20%28composer%29\"&gt;Jorge Mart\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; premiered at the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Worth%20Opera\"&gt;Fort Worth Opera&lt;/a&gt; on May 29, 2010, with baritone &lt;a href=\"Wes%20Mason\"&gt;Wes Mason&lt;/a&gt; singing the role of Arenas.\nThe Reinaldo Arenas Papers are held at Princeton University Library. \u201cThe collection consists of personal and working papers of Reinaldo Arenas\u201d and includes typescript and typescript drafts, essays, interviews, newspaper clippings, correspondence and other documents.\nFurther reading.\n\"English\"\nSpanish"
