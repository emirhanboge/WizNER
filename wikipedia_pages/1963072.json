    "text": "K.S.K. Ronse is a Belgian &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club from &lt;a href=\"Ronse\"&gt;Ronse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Flanders\"&gt;East Flanders&lt;/a&gt; born in 1987 from the fusion between Assa Ronse and R.F.C. Renaisien.\nHistory.\nA.S. Renaisienne was founded in 1906 and received later the &lt;a href=\"matricule\"&gt;matricule&lt;/a&gt; n\u00b0 38. The club first reached second division in 1923 but returned to third division in 1926 as only the best 7 from each league (A and B) were qualified to play the united second division on the next season. After two seasons at the third level, A.S. Renaisienne was back to second division for just one year (as they finished last). In 1931, the other club from the town (that was then named Club Renaisien with matricule n\u00b0 46) promoted to second division joined in 1937 by A.S., both clubs remaining there until the competition was stopped due to World War II. After the war, the two clubs declined, Club (now named R.F.C. Renaisien) making a short one-season appearance in second division (1958\u201359). In 1987 the fusion became inevitable. The new club kept the matricule n\u00b0 38. After a few years of struggling in lower divisions they made it back to the second in 2001. After a short intermezzo in third (2007/2008) they again got back into the second division for two more years. Since then however the club declined again. They are currently playing in the second amateur division."
