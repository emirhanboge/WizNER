    "text": "Religion in Australia is diverse with &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; being the most widely professed faith. Section 116 of the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Constitution of Australia&lt;/a&gt; of 1901 prohibits the Commonwealth government from &lt;a href=\"Established%20church\"&gt;establishing a church&lt;/a&gt; or interfering with the &lt;a href=\"freedom%20of%20religion\"&gt;freedom of religion&lt;/a&gt;. In an optional question on the 2016 Census, 52.2% of the Australian population declared some variety of &lt;a href=\"Christianity%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, around 9% less than just five years prior. Historically the percentage was far higher; now, the religious landscape of &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; is changing and diversifying. According to the 2016 estimate, religious distribution is as follows: &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; 23.1% (&lt;a href=\"Anglicanism\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; 13.3%, &lt;a href=\"Uniting%20Church%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Uniting Church&lt;/a&gt; 3.7%, &lt;a href=\"Presbyterianism\"&gt;Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reformed%20Presbyterian%20Global%20Alliance\"&gt;Reformed&lt;/a&gt; 2.3%, &lt;a href=\"Baptists\"&gt;Baptist&lt;/a&gt; 1.5%, &lt;a href=\"Pentecostalism\"&gt;Pentecostal&lt;/a&gt; 1.1%, &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; .7%, other Protestant .5%), &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; 22.6%, other Christian 4.2%, &lt;a href=\"Muslims\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; 2.6%, &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; 2.4%, &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20christian\"&gt;Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; 2.3% (&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; 2.1%, &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodox%20Churches\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; .2%), &lt;a href=\"Hindus\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; 1.9%, other 1.3%, &lt;a href=\"Atheism\"&gt;none&lt;/a&gt; 30.1%, unspecified 9.6%. In 2016, 30.1% of Australians stated \"no religion\" and a further 9.6% chose not to answer the question. Other faiths include &lt;a href=\"Sikhs\"&gt;Sikhs&lt;/a&gt; (0.5%) and &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;s (0.4%).\nAustralia's &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australians\"&gt;Aboriginal people&lt;/a&gt; developed the animist spirituality of &lt;a href=\"Dreaming%20%28spirituality%29\"&gt;the Dreaming&lt;/a&gt; and some of the earliest evidence on earth for religious practices among humans has been found in the archaeological record of their ancestors. &lt;a href=\"Torres%20Strait%20Islander\"&gt;Torres Strait Islander&lt;/a&gt; religion bore similarities to broader &lt;a href=\"Melanesian%20mythology\"&gt;Melanesian&lt;/a&gt; spirituality. The general isolation of indigenous Australian religion ended with the arrival of the first British settlers in 1788, whereafter subsequent immigrants and their descendants have been predominantly Christian.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; originally held a position of privilege in early colonial Australia, a legal framework guaranteeing religious equality evolved within a few decades. Large numbers of Irish Catholics were transported to Australia through the British criminal justice system. British Nonconformist Methodist, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Baptists set up their own churches in the 19th century, as did &lt;a href=\"Lutheran%20Church%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Lutherans from Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmaller groups also arrived and established their churches. Jews started arriving in the early 19th century. The &lt;a href=\"Australian%20gold%20rushes\"&gt;Australian gold rushes&lt;/a&gt; brought in workers from China and the Pacific islands, as well as specialised workers from &lt;a href=\"British%20India\"&gt;British India&lt;/a&gt;, such as the mainly Muslim \"&lt;a href=\"Afghan%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Afghan Cameleers&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWhile Australia has a strong tradition of secular government, religious organisations have played a significant role in public life. The Protestant and Catholic churches played an integral role in the development of education, health and welfare services.\nToday, around a quarter of Christians attend church weekly; around a quarter of all school students attend church-affiliated schools. The Christian festivals of Easter and Christmas are public holidays.\nHistory.\nIndigenous Australian religion.\nAt the time of British settlement, the &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;Indigenous Australians&lt;/a&gt; had their own religious traditions of the &lt;a href=\"Dreaming%20%28spirituality%29\"&gt;Dreaming&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"Mircea%20Eliade\"&gt;Mircea Eliade&lt;/a&gt; put it, \"There is a general belief among the [indigenous] Australians that the world, man, and the various animals and plants were created by certain Supernatural beings who afterwards disappeared, either ascending to the sky or entering the earth.\" and &lt;a href=\"ritual\"&gt;ritual&lt;/a&gt; systems, with an emphasis on life transitions such as &lt;a href=\"adulthood\"&gt;adulthood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to European &lt;a href=\"colonisation\"&gt;colonisation&lt;/a&gt; in 1788 there was contact with Indigenous Australians from people of various faiths. These contacts were with explorers, fishermen and survivors of the numerous shipwrecks. There have been countless artifacts retrieved from these contacts. The Aborigines of Northern Australia (&lt;a href=\"Arnhem%20Land\"&gt;Arnhem Land&lt;/a&gt;) retain stories, songs and paintings of trade and cultural interaction with boat-people from the north. These people are generally regarded as being from the east &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"archipelago\"&gt;archipelago&lt;/a&gt;. (See: &lt;a href=\"Macassan%20contact%20with%20Australia\"&gt;Macassan contact with Australia&lt;/a&gt;.) There is some evidence of Islamic terms and concepts entering northern Aboriginal culture via this interaction.\nCenturies before European sailors reached Australia, Christian theologians already speculated whether the region, located on the opposite side of the world from Europe, had human inhabitants and, if so, whether the &lt;a href=\"Antipodes\"&gt;Antipodes&lt;/a&gt; descended from &lt;a href=\"Adam%20%28Bible%29\"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; and have been redeemed by &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt;. The prevailing point of view, expressed by &lt;a href=\"St.%20Augustine%20of%20Hippo\"&gt;St. Augustine of Hippo&lt;/a&gt;, was that \"it is too absurd to say that some men might have set sail from this side and, traversing the immense expanse of ocean, have propagated there a race of human beings descended from that one first man.\" A dissenting view, held by the Irish-Austrian St. &lt;a href=\"Vergilius%20of%20Salzburg\"&gt;Vergilius of Salzburg&lt;/a&gt;, was \"that beneath the earth there was another world and other men\"; while not much is known about Vergilius' views, the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" speculates that he was able to clear himself from accusations of heresy by explaining that the people of the hypothetical Australia \"were\" descended from Adam and redeemed by Christ.\nBy the early 18th century, Christian leaders felt that the natives of the little-known \"Terra Australis Incognita\" and \"Hollandia Nova\" (still often thought as two distinct land masses) were in need of conversion to Christianity. In 1724, a young &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Edwards%20%28theologian%29\"&gt;Jonathan Edwards&lt;/a&gt; wrote: \nAnd what is peculiarly glorious in it, is the gospelizing the new and before unknown world, that which is so remote, so unknown, where the devil had reigned quietly from the beginning of the world, which is larger \u2013 taking in America, Terra Australis Incognita, Hollandia Nova, ... \u2013 is far greater than the old world. I say, that this new world should all worship the God of Israel, whose worship was then confined to so narrow a land, is wonderful and glorious!\nChristianity.\nChristianity came to Australia with the first British settlers on the &lt;a href=\"First%20Fleet\"&gt;First Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. Of the convicts and settlers, most were members of the established Church of England and Ireland with lesser numbers of Nonconformist Protestants, &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt; and other faiths. The first religious census in 1828 divided the early colony into four groups: Protestants, Catholics, Jews and Pagans.\nThe First Fleet brought tensions to Australia fuelled by historical grievances between Catholics and other Christians, tensions that would continue into the 20th century.\nThe first chaplain, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Johnson%20%28chaplain%29\"&gt;Richard Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; cleric, was charged by Governor &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Phillip\"&gt;Arthur Phillip&lt;/a&gt; with improving \"public morality\" in the colony, but he was also heavily involved in health and education. Christian leaders have remained prominent in health and education in Australia ever since, with over a fifth of students attending church schools at the beginning of the 21st century and a number of the nation's hospitals, care facilities and charities having been founded by Christian organisations.\nThough free settlers began to arrive in the late 18th century, it was the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20gold%20rushes\"&gt;gold rush of the 1850s&lt;/a&gt; that led to radically increased immigration. The new settlers brought with them their religious traditions, such as &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Catholic\"&gt;Irish Catholic&lt;/a&gt;ism, &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Presbyterian\"&gt;Scottish Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt;ism and English &lt;a href=\"Anglicanism\"&gt;Anglicanism&lt;/a&gt; among others. Australian Aborigines suffered a decline during this period as they were dispossessed of their lands and diseases spread among their population. Christian churches organised missions during this period, formally intended to \"civilise\" Aboriginal communities and spread Christianity. The overall consequences of this activity are still disputed, but it contributed to the decline of indigenous languages and beliefs.\nIn Western Australia, the Anglican clergy saw themselves as pioneering a new society. Besides the usual religious roles of leading church building and public worship they took a major part in charity, education and public debate. They attempted to refashion it in their own ecclesiastical image based on English models.\nThe Church of England was &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Adisestablish\"&gt;disestablished&lt;/a&gt; in the colony of &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; by the \"Church Act of 1836\". Drafted by the reformist attorney-general &lt;a href=\"John%20Plunkett\"&gt;John Plunkett&lt;/a&gt;, the act established legal equality for Anglicans, Catholics and Presbyterians and was later extended to Methodists.\n&lt;a href=\"Freedom%20of%20Religion\"&gt;Freedom of Religion&lt;/a&gt; was enshrined in &lt;a href=\"Section%20116%20of%20the%20Constitution%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia&lt;/a&gt; of 1901. By 1901 apart from the indigenous population and the descendants of &lt;a href=\"gold%20rush\"&gt;gold rush&lt;/a&gt; migrants, Australian society was predominantly Anglo-Celtic, with 40% of the population being Anglican, 23% Catholic, 34% other Christian and about 1% professing non-Christian religions. There was a Lutheran population of German descent in South Australia.\nOther religions.\nThere were at least 15 Jews in the First Fleet, 14 convicts and one \"free\" child. The &lt;a href=\"Tolpuddle%20Martyrs\"&gt;Tolpuddle Martyrs&lt;/a&gt; were sentenced to &lt;a href=\"penal%20transportation\"&gt;penal transportation&lt;/a&gt; to Australia because friendly societies had strong elements of what are now considered to be the predominant role of trade unions. Before 1901, some Muslim sailors and prisoners came to Australia on convict ships. &lt;a href=\"Afghan%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Afghan cameleers&lt;/a&gt; settled in Australia from the 1860s onwards, a number of them being &lt;a href=\"Sikhism%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Sikh&lt;/a&gt;. From the 1870s &lt;a href=\"Malay%20race\"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt; divers were recruited (with most subsequently repatriated).\nIn 1901, the government passed an act limiting immigration to those of European descent in what came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"White%20Australia%20Policy\"&gt;White Australia Policy&lt;/a&gt;. By effectively limiting the immigration of practitioners of different faiths, this policy ensured that Christianity remained the religion of the overwhelming majority of Australians for the foreseeable future and, indeed, to the present day. The first census in 1911 showed 96% identified themselves as Christian. The tensions that came with the First Fleet continued into the 1960s: job vacancy advertisements sometimes included the stipulation of \"Protestant preferred\" or that \"Catholics Need Not Apply\". Nevertheless, Australia elected its first Catholic prime minister, &lt;a href=\"James%20Scullin\"&gt;James Scullin&lt;/a&gt;, in 1929 and Sir &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Isaacs\"&gt;Isaac Isaacs&lt;/a&gt;, a Jew, was appointed governor-general in 1930.\nConstitutional status.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Australian%20constitution\"&gt;Australian constitution&lt;/a&gt; consists of several documents, including the &lt;a href=\"Statute%20of%20Westminster%201931\"&gt;Statute of Westminster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Australia%20Act\"&gt;Australia Act of 1986&lt;/a&gt;, but there is only one reference to religion in the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20Commonwealth%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, signed into law in 1900. Notably, the constitution does not include a &lt;a href=\"bill%20of%20rights\"&gt;bill of rights&lt;/a&gt; and, as a result, Australia's fundamental law has been criticised for its lack of explicit protection for several rights and freedoms. However, Section 116 of the 1900 act to constitute the Commonwealth of Australia (Australian Constitution) provides that:\nThe Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.\nTechnically, this article does not affect the states' authority to legislate on religion, nor would it block federal legislation on religion aside from that establishing an &lt;a href=\"official%20religion\"&gt;official religion&lt;/a&gt; of Australia. In practice, though, the government respects these rights and contributes to the generally free practice of religion. Australia does not have a \"separation of church and state\"- the essence of a secular state- in the sense that countries like the USA do. In view of Section 116 of Australia's constitution (\"The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance \u2026\u201d) it is commonly believed that Australia is already a \"secular state\". This is a misconception. In 1981, the High Court determined that there is in fact no constitutional separation of church and state in Australia. However, there is nothing in the constitution that necessitates the legislative establishment of multiple religions, or that prevents the creation of a truly secular state.\nIn 1983, the High Court of Australia defined religion as \"a complex of beliefs and practices which point to a set of values and an understanding of the meaning of existence\". The \"ABS 2001 Census Dictionary\" defines \"no religion\" as a category of religion which has subcategories such as &lt;a href=\"agnosticism\"&gt;agnosticism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"atheism\"&gt;atheism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Humanism\"&gt;Humanism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rationalism\"&gt;rationalism&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Human%20Rights%20and%20Equal%20Opportunity%20Commission\"&gt;Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt; (HREOC) is able to inquire into allegations of discrimination on religious grounds.\nIn 1998 the HREOC addressed the right to freedom of religion and belief in Australia against article 18 of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Covenant%20on%20Civil%20and%20Political%20Rights\"&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&lt;/a&gt;, stating that \"despite the legal protections that apply in different jurisdictions, many Australians suffer discrimination on the basis of religious belief or non-belief, including members of both mainstream and non-mainstream religions, and those of no religious persuasion.\"\nAn example of an HREOC response to such views is the IsmaU project, which examines possible prejudice against Muslims in Australia since the &lt;a href=\"September%2011%20attacks\"&gt;11 September 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; in the US and the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Bali%20bombings\"&gt;Bali bombings&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemographics.\nA question on religion has been asked in every census taken in Australia, with the voluntary nature of this question having been specifically stated since 1933. In 1971, the instruction \"if no religion, write none\" was introduced. This saw a sevenfold increase from the previous census year in the percentage of Australians stating they had no religion. Since 1971, this percentage has progressively increased to 30.1% in 2016.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics\"&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics&lt;/a&gt; (ABS) 2006 Census Dictionary statement on religious affiliation states the purpose for gathering such information:\nData on religious affiliation are used for such purposes as planning educational facilities, aged persons' care and other social services provided by religion-based organisations; the location of church buildings; the assigning of chaplains to hospitals, prisons, armed services and universities; the allocation of time on public radio and other media; and sociological research.\nThe census question about religion is optional, and asks \"What is the person's religion?\", giving respondents a choice of nine religions, \"Other\" and \"No religion\". At the &lt;a href=\"Census%20in%20Australia%232016\"&gt;2016 census&lt;/a&gt; 9.6% of people declined to answer, or they did not give a response adequate for interpretation. The religious views of those people are not known, so it is not proper to group them together with people who state that they have no religion \u2013 instead, all the census figures about religion should be treated with corresponding confidence levels.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Census%20in%20Australia%232016\"&gt;2016 census&lt;/a&gt; identified that 52.1% of Australians classify themselves Christian: 22.6% identifying themselves as Catholic and 13.3% as &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Church\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt;. Another 8.2% of Australians identify themselves as followers of non-Christian religions. The second-largest classification was the 30.1% who categorised themselves as having \"No religion\"; this is most evident amongst younger people, with 39% of people aged 18\u201334 choosing that option (it was 12% in 1976).\nAs in many Western countries, the level of active participation in church worship is much lower than this; weekly attendance at church services is well under 1 million, about 4% of the population.\nAccording to the time series data released with the &lt;a href=\"Census%20in%20Australia%232016\"&gt;2016 census&lt;/a&gt;, the fastest growing religious classifications over the ten years between 2006 and 2016 were:\nMeanwhile, the greatest decreases were in the major Christian denominations; all Christian denominations combined decreased from 63.9% to 52.1%.\nTotal fertility rate.\nAs of 2016, &lt;a href=\"Buddhists\"&gt;Buddhists&lt;/a&gt; (1.68), &lt;a href=\"Hindus\"&gt;Hindus&lt;/a&gt; (1.81) and &lt;a href=\"Irreligion\"&gt;Irreligion&lt;/a&gt; (1.84) have the lowest fertility rate. &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt; (2.11) and &lt;a href=\"Jewish\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; (2.17) have a moderate TFR, with &lt;a href=\"Muslims\"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; having the highest fertility rate at 3.03.\nIndigenous Australian traditions.\nPrior to British colonisation in Australia, the &lt;a href=\"animist\"&gt;animist&lt;/a&gt; beliefs of Indigenous Australian peoples had been practised for millennia. In the case of mainland &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australians\"&gt;Aboriginal Australians&lt;/a&gt;, their spirituality is known as &lt;a href=\"Dreaming%20%28spirituality%29\"&gt;the Dreaming&lt;/a&gt; and it places a heavy emphasis on belonging to the land. The collection of stories which it contains shaped Aboriginal law and customs. &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20art\"&gt;Aboriginal art&lt;/a&gt;, story and dance continue to draw on these spiritual traditions. In the case of the &lt;a href=\"Torres%20Strait%20Islanders\"&gt;Torres Strait Islanders&lt;/a&gt; who inhabit the islands between Australia and New Guinea, spirituality and customs reflected their &lt;a href=\"Melanesia\"&gt;Melanesia&lt;/a&gt;n origins and dependence on the sea.\nIndigenous Australians have a complex &lt;a href=\"oral%20tradition\"&gt;oral tradition&lt;/a&gt; and spiritual values based upon reverence for the land and a belief in &lt;a href=\"Dreaming%20%28spirituality%29\"&gt;the Dreaming&lt;/a&gt;. The Dreaming is at once the ancient time of creation and the present day reality of Dreaming. There were a great many different groups, each with their own individual culture, belief structure, and language. These cultures overlapped to a greater or lesser extent, and evolved over time. The &lt;a href=\"Rainbow%20Serpent\"&gt;Rainbow Serpent&lt;/a&gt; is a major dream spirit for Aboriginal people across Australia. The &lt;a href=\"Yowie%20%28cryptid%29\"&gt;Yowie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bunyip\"&gt;Bunyip&lt;/a&gt; are other well known dream spirits. At the time of the British settlement, traditional religions were &lt;a href=\"animist\"&gt;animist&lt;/a&gt; and also tended to have elements of &lt;a href=\"ancestor%20worship\"&gt;ancestor worship&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the 2001 census, 5,244 persons or less than 0.03 percent of respondents reported practising Aboriginal traditional religions. Aboriginal beliefs and spirituality, even among those Aborigines who identify themselves as members of a traditional organised religion, are intrinsically linked to the land generally and to certain sites of significance in particular. The 1996 census reported that almost 72 percent of Aborigines practised some form of Christianity and 16 percent listed no religion. The 2001 census contained no comparable updated data.\nSince British settlement.\n&lt;a href=\"European%20culture\"&gt;European culture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; have had a significant impact on &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;Indigenous Australians&lt;/a&gt;. As in many &lt;a href=\"colonialism\"&gt;colonial&lt;/a&gt; situations the churches both facilitated the loss of Indigenous Australian culture and religion and also facilitated its maintenance. The involvement of Christians in Aboriginal affairs has evolved significantly since 1788. Around the year 2000, many churches and church organisations officially apologised for past failures to adequately respect indigenous cultures and address the injustices of the dispossession of indigenous people.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Torres%20Strait%20Islands\"&gt;Torres Strait Islands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Coming%20of%20the%20Light%20Festival\"&gt;Coming of the Light Festival&lt;/a&gt; marks the day the Christian missionaries first arrived on the islands on 1 July 1871 and introduced Christianity to the region. This is a significant festival for Torres Strait Islanders, who are predominantly Christian. Religious and cultural ceremonies are held across Torres Strait and mainland Australia.\nProminent Aboriginal activist &lt;a href=\"Noel%20Pearson\"&gt;Noel Pearson&lt;/a&gt;, himself raised at a &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; mission in &lt;a href=\"Cape%20York%20Peninsula\"&gt;Cape York&lt;/a&gt;, has written that missions throughout Australia's colonial history \"provided a haven from the hell of life on the Australian frontier while at the same time facilitating colonisation\". Prominent Aboriginal Christians have included Pastor &lt;a href=\"David%20Unaipon\"&gt;David Unaipon&lt;/a&gt;, the first Aboriginal author; Pastor Sir &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Nicholls\"&gt;Douglas Nicholls&lt;/a&gt;, athlete, activist and former Governor of &lt;a href=\"South%20Australia\"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Mum%20%28Shirl%29%20Smith\"&gt;Mum (Shirl) Smith&lt;/a&gt;, a celebrated &lt;a href=\"Redfern%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Redfern&lt;/a&gt; community worker who, assisted by the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Charity%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Sisters of Charity&lt;/a&gt;, work to assist Aborigines.; and former Senator &lt;a href=\"Aden%20Ridgeway\"&gt;Aden Ridgeway&lt;/a&gt;, the first Chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Catholic%20Ministry\"&gt;Aboriginal Catholic Ministry&lt;/a&gt;. In recent times, Christians such as Fr &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Kennedy%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; of Redfern, &lt;a href=\"Jesuit\"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt; human rights lawyer Fr &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Brennan%20%28Jesuit%29\"&gt;Frank Brennan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20St%20Joseph%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Heart\"&gt;Josephite Sisters&lt;/a&gt; have been prominent in working for Aboriginal rights and improvements to standards of living.\nAbrahamic religions.\nChristianity.\nSince the arrival of the first Christian settlers on the &lt;a href=\"First%20Fleet\"&gt;First Fleet&lt;/a&gt; of British ships in 1788, Christianity has gradually become the major religion in Australia. Consequently, the Christian festivals of &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Easter\"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt; are public holidays, the skylines of Australian cities and towns are marked by church and cathedral spires and the Christian churches have played an integral role in the development of education, health and welfare services in Australia.\nThe churches with the largest number of members are the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Church%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Anglican Church of Australia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Uniting%20Church%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Uniting Church in Australia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pentecostalism\"&gt;Pentecostal&lt;/a&gt; churches are also present with &lt;a href=\"megachurch\"&gt;megachurch&lt;/a&gt;es being found in most states (for example, &lt;a href=\"Hillsong%20Church\"&gt;Hillsong Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Community%20Church\"&gt;Paradise Community Church&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"National%20Council%20of%20Churches%20in%20Australia\"&gt;National Council of Churches in Australia&lt;/a&gt; is the main &lt;a href=\"Ecumenism\"&gt;Christian ecumenical body&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor much of Australian history, the Church of England in Australia, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Church%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Anglican Church of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, was the largest religious affiliation, however multicultural immigration has contributed to a decline in its relative position, with the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; benefiting from the opening of post-war Australia to multicultural immigration and becoming the largest group. The &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Orthodox%20Archdiocese%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia&lt;/a&gt; and other congregations associated with non-British cultures have also expanded.\nIn his welcoming address to the Catholic &lt;a href=\"World%20Youth%20Day%202008\"&gt;World Youth Day 2008&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney, the Prime Minister of Australia, &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Rudd\"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt;, said that Christianity had been a positive influence on Australia: \"It was the\" (Christian) \"church that began first schools for the poor, it was the church that began first hospitals for the poor, it was the church that began first refuges for the poor and these great traditions continue for the future.\" Christian charitable organisations, hospitals and schools have played a prominent role in welfare and education since Colonial times, when &lt;a href=\"First%20Fleet\"&gt;First Fleet&lt;/a&gt; chaplain &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Johnson%20%28chaplain%29\"&gt;Richard Johnson&lt;/a&gt; was credited as \"the physician both of soul and body\" during the famine of 1790, and was charged with general supervision of schools.\nToday, the is the second biggest sector after government schools, with more than 750,000 students in 2018 (and around 21 per cent of all secondary school enrolments). The around 105,000 students and the Uniting Church has around 48 schools. Smaller denominations, including the in Australia. The &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Orthodox%20Archdiocese%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia&lt;/a&gt; also has 8 schools across the country. There are two Catholic universities in Australia, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Catholic%20University\"&gt;Australian Catholic University&lt;/a&gt; which opened in 1991 following the amalgamation of four Catholic tertiary institutions in eastern Australia and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Notre%20Dame%20Australia\"&gt;University of Notre Dame Australia&lt;/a&gt; which is based in Perth.\n&lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Social%20Services%20Australia\"&gt;Catholic Social Services Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s 63 member organisations help more than a million Australians every year. Anglican organisations work in health, missionary work, social welfare and communications; and the Uniting Church does extensive community work, in aged care, hospitals, nursing, family support services, youth services and with the homeless, and especially throughout inland Australia. Christian charities such as the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Vincent%20de%20Paul%20Society\"&gt;Saint Vincent de Paul Society&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Salvation%20Army\"&gt;Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt;, Anglicare, and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Riley%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Youth Off the Streets&lt;/a&gt; receive considerable national support. Religious orders founded many of Australia's hospitals, such as &lt;a href=\"St%20Vincent%27s%20Hospital%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, which was opened as a free hospital in 1857 by the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Charity%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Sisters of Charity&lt;/a&gt; and is now Australia's largest not-for-profit health provider and has trained prominent Australian surgeons such as &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Chang\"&gt;Victor Chang&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable Australian Christians have included: &lt;a href=\"Mary%20MacKillop\"&gt;Mary MacKillop&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 educator, founder of the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20St%20Joseph%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Heart\"&gt;Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart&lt;/a&gt; and the first Australian to be recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church; &lt;a href=\"David%20Unaipon\"&gt;David Unaipon&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 an Aboriginal writer, inventor and Christian preacher currently featured on the Australian $50 note; Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Mannix\"&gt;Daniel Mannix&lt;/a&gt; of Melbourne \u2013 a controversial voice against &lt;a href=\"Conscription\"&gt;Conscription&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and against British policy in Ireland; the Reverend &lt;a href=\"John%20Flynn%20%28minister%29\"&gt;John Flynn&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 founder of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Flying%20Doctor%20Service\"&gt;Royal Flying Doctor Service&lt;/a&gt;, currently featured on the Australian $20 note; Sir &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Nicholls\"&gt;Douglas Nicholls&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Aboriginal rights activist, athlete, pastor and former Governor of &lt;a href=\"South%20Australia\"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Stylianos%20Harkianakis\"&gt;Archbishop Stylianos Harkianakis&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Archbishop and primate of the Greek Orthodox church in Australia from 1975 to 2019\n&lt;a href=\"Sectarianism\"&gt;Sectarianism&lt;/a&gt; in Australia tended to reflect the political inheritance of Britain and Ireland. Until 1945, the vast majority of Catholics in Australia were of Irish descent, causing the British majority to question their loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The first Catholic priests arrived in Australia as convicts in 1800, but the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Hill%20Rebellion\"&gt;Castle Hill Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; of 1804 alarmed the British authorities and no further priests were allowed in the colony until 1820, when London sent &lt;a href=\"John%20Joseph%20Therry\"&gt;John Joseph Therry&lt;/a&gt; and Philip Connolly. In 1901, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Constitution\"&gt;Australian Constitution&lt;/a&gt; guaranteed &lt;a href=\"Separation%20of%20Church%20and%20State\"&gt;Separation of Church and State&lt;/a&gt;. A notable period of sectarianism re-emerged during the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; and the 1916 &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Uprising\"&gt;Easter Uprising&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland, but the significance of sectarian division declined dramatically after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. There was a growth in non-religious adherence, but also a diversification of Christian churches (especially the growth of Greek, Macedonian, Serbian and Russian Orthodox churches), together with an increase in &lt;a href=\"ecumenism\"&gt;ecumenism&lt;/a&gt; among Christians, through organisations such as the &lt;a href=\"National%20Council%20of%20Churches%20in%20Australia\"&gt;National Council of Churches in Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the most visible signs of the historical importance of Christianity to Australia is the prominence of churches in most Australian towns and cities. Among Australia's oldest are Ebenezer Chapel and the Anglican St Matthew's, Windsor, St Luke's, Liverpool, St Peter's, Campbelltown and &lt;a href=\"St%20James%20Church%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;St James Church, Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, built between 1819 and 1824 by Governor &lt;a href=\"Lachlan%20Macquarie\"&gt;Macquarie&lt;/a&gt;'s architect, &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Greenway\"&gt;Francis Greenway&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"St%20Mary%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, was built to a design by &lt;a href=\"William%20Wardell\"&gt;William Wardell&lt;/a&gt; from a foundation stone laid in 1868; the spires of the cathedral were not finally added until the year 2000. Wardell also worked on the design of &lt;a href=\"St%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 among the finest examples of &lt;a href=\"ecclesiastical%20architecture\"&gt;ecclesiastical architecture&lt;/a&gt; in Australia. The Anglican &lt;a href=\"St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, in the iconic hub of the city opposite &lt;a href=\"Flinders%20Street%20railway%20station\"&gt;Flinders Street station&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; is known as the \"City of Churches\", but churches extend far into the Australian &lt;a href=\"Outback\"&gt;Outback&lt;/a&gt;, as at the historic Lutheran Mission Chapel at &lt;a href=\"Hermannsburg%2C%20Northern%20Territory\"&gt;Hermannsburg, Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt;. Along with community attitudes to religion, church architecture changed significantly during the 20th century. Urban churches, such as the &lt;a href=\"Wayside%20Chapel\"&gt;Wayside Chapel&lt;/a&gt; (1964) in Sydney, differed markedly from traditional ecclesiastical designs. In the later 20th century, distinctly Australian approaches were applied at places such as &lt;a href=\"Jambaroo%20Benedictine%20Abbey\"&gt;Jambaroo Benedictine Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, where natural materials were chosen to \"harmonise with the local environment\" and the chapel sanctuary is of glass overlooking rainforest. Similar design principles were applied at &lt;a href=\"Thredbo%20Ecumenical%20Chapel\"&gt;Thredbo Ecumenical Chapel&lt;/a&gt; built in the &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Mountains\"&gt;Snowy Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in 1996.\nThe Christian festivals of Christmas and Easter are national public holidays in Australia. Christmas, which recalls the birth of &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Christ\"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;, is celebrated on 25 December during the Australian summer (although on 7 January by some Eastern Orthodox) and is an important cultural festival even for many non-religious Australians. The European traditions of &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20tree\"&gt;Christmas tree&lt;/a&gt;s, roast dinners, &lt;a href=\"carols\"&gt;carols&lt;/a&gt; and gift giving are all continued in Australia, but they might be conducted between visits to the beach.\nHere are some Christian denominations with Australian articles:\nIslam.\nThe first contacts that Islam had with Australia was when Muslim fishermen native to Makassar, which is today a part of Indonesia, visited North-Western Australia long before British settlement in 1788. This contact of South East Asian ethnic groups of Islamic faith can be identified from the graves they dug for their comrades who died on the journey, being that they face &lt;a href=\"Mecca\"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Arabia\"&gt;Arabia&lt;/a&gt;), in accordance with Islamic regulations concerning burial, as well as evidence from Aboriginal cave paintings and religious ceremonies which depict and incorporate the adoption of Makassan canoe designs and words.\nIn later history, throughout the 19th century following British settlement, other Muslims came to Australia including the Muslim 'Afghan' cameleers, who used their camels to transport goods and people through the otherwise unnavigable desert and pioneered a network of camel tracks that later became roads across the &lt;a href=\"Outback\"&gt;Outback&lt;/a&gt;. Australia's first mosque was built for them at &lt;a href=\"Marree%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Marree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Australia\"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; in 1861. Between the 1860s and 1920s around 2000 cameleers were brought from Afghanistan and the north west of British India (now Pakistan) and perhaps 100 families remained in Australia. Other outback mosques were established at places like &lt;a href=\"Coolgardie\"&gt;Coolgardie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cloncurry\"&gt;Cloncurry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Hill\"&gt;Broken Hill&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 and more permanent mosques in Adelaide, Perth and later Brisbane. A legacy of this pioneer era is the presence of wild camels in Outback and the oldest Islamic structure in the &lt;a href=\"southern%20hemisphere\"&gt;southern hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Central%20Adelaide%20Mosque\"&gt;Central Adelaide Mosque&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, despite their significant role in Australia prior to the establishment of rail and road networks, the formulation of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Australia\"&gt;White Australia&lt;/a&gt; policy at the time of Federation made immigration difficult for the 'Afghans' and their memory slowly faded during the 20th century, until a revival of interest began in the 1980s.\nSuccessive Australian governments dismantled the White Australia Policy in the Post-WW2 period. From the 1970s onwards, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Gough%20Whitlam\"&gt;Gough Whitlam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Fraser\"&gt;Malcolm Fraser&lt;/a&gt;, Australia began to pursue &lt;a href=\"multiculturalism\"&gt;multiculturalism&lt;/a&gt;. Australia in the later 20th century became a refuge for many Muslims fleeing conflicts including those in &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sudan\"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. General immigration, combined with religious conversion to Islam by Christians and other Australians, as well as Australia's participation in UN refugee efforts has increased the overall Muslim population. Around 36% of Muslims are Australian born. Overseas born Muslims come from a great variety of nations and ethnic groups \u2013 with large Lebanese and Turkish communities.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"11%20September%20attacks\"&gt;11 September attacks&lt;/a&gt;, associations drawn between the political ideology of &lt;a href=\"Osama%20Bin%20Laden\"&gt;Osama Bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; and the religion of Islam have stirred debate in some quarters in Australia regarding Islam's relationship with the wider community \u2013 with some advocating greater emphasis on assimilation, and others supporting renewed commitment to diversity. The deaths of Australians in bombings by militant Islamic fundamentalists in New York in 2001, &lt;a href=\"2002%20Bali%20bombings\"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; in 2002\u20135 and &lt;a href=\"7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; in 2005; as well as the sending of Australian troops to &lt;a href=\"East%20Timor\"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, Afghanistan in 2001 and &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in 2003; the arrest of bomb plotters in Australia; and concerns about certain cultural practices such as the wearing of the &lt;a href=\"Burkha\"&gt;Burkha&lt;/a&gt; have all contributed to a degree of tension in recent times A series of comments by a senior Sydney cleric, Sheikh &lt;a href=\"Taj%20El-Din%20Hilaly\"&gt;Taj El-Din Hilaly&lt;/a&gt; also stirred controversy, particularly his remarks regarding \"female modesty\" following an incident of &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20gang%20rapes\"&gt;gang rape in Sydney&lt;/a&gt; Australians were among the targets of Islamic Fundamentalists in the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Bali%20bombings\"&gt;Bali bombings&lt;/a&gt; in Indonesia and attack on Australian Embassy in Jakarta and the &lt;a href=\"South%20East%20Asia\"&gt;South East Asia&lt;/a&gt;n militant group &lt;a href=\"Jemaah%20Islamiyah\"&gt;Jemaah Islamiyah&lt;/a&gt; has been of particular concern to Australians.\nThe Australian government's &lt;a href=\"Mandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia\"&gt;mandatory detention&lt;/a&gt; processing system for &lt;a href=\"asylum%20seekers\"&gt;asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt; became increasingly controversial after the 11 September attacks. A significant proportion of recent Asylum seekers arriving by boat have been Muslims fleeing the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere. Some Islamic leaders and social commentators claim that Islam has suffered from unfair stereotyping Violence and intimidation was directed against Muslims and people of Middle Eastern appearance during southern Sydney's &lt;a href=\"Cronulla%20riots\"&gt;Cronulla riots&lt;/a&gt; in 2005.\nIn 2005, the &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Government\"&gt;Howard Government&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20Community%20Reference%20Group\"&gt;Muslim Community Reference Group&lt;/a&gt; to advise on Muslim community issues for one year, chaired by &lt;a href=\"Ameer%20Ali%20%28academic%29\"&gt;Ameer Ali&lt;/a&gt;. Inter-faith dialogues were also established by Christian and Muslim groups such as The &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Federation%20of%20Islamic%20Councils\"&gt;Australian Federation of Islamic Councils&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Council%20of%20Churches%20in%20Australia\"&gt;National Council of Churches in Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Australia and Indonesia co-operated closely following the Bali-bombings, not only in law-enforcement but in improving education and cross-cultural understanding, leading to a marked improvement in relations. After a series of controversies, Sheikh &lt;a href=\"Taj%20El-Din%20Hilaly\"&gt;Taj El-Din Hilaly&lt;/a&gt; retired as &lt;a href=\"Grand%20mufti\"&gt;Grand mufti&lt;/a&gt; of Australia in 2007 and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Fehmi%20Naji%20El-Imam\"&gt;Fehmi Naji El-Imam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Australia\"&gt;AM&lt;/a&gt;.\nToday, over 370,000 people in Australia identify as Muslim, with diverse communities concentrated mainly in Sydney and Melbourne. More than half are non-practising &lt;a href=\"cultural%20Muslim\"&gt;cultural Muslim&lt;/a&gt;s. Since the 1970s Islamic schools have been established as well as more than 100 mosques and prayer centres. Many notable Muslim places of worship are to be found in large Australian cities, including the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Adelaide%20Mosque\"&gt;Central Adelaide Mosque&lt;/a&gt;, which was constructed during the 1880s; and Sydney's Classical Ottoman style &lt;a href=\"Auburn%20Gallipoli%20Mosque\"&gt;Auburn Gallipoli Mosque&lt;/a&gt;, which was largely funded by the Turkish community and the name of which recalls the shared heritage of the foundation of modern Turkey and the story of the &lt;a href=\"ANZAC\"&gt;ANZAC&lt;/a&gt;s. 1,140 people identified as &lt;a href=\"Islam%20in%20Australia%23Aboriginal%20Muslims\"&gt;Aboriginal Muslim&lt;/a&gt;s in the 2011 census, almost double the number recorded in the 2001 census. Notable Australian Muslims include boxer &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Mundine\"&gt;Anthony Mundine&lt;/a&gt;; community worker and &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href=\"Hazem%20El%20Masri\"&gt;Hazem El Masri&lt;/a&gt;; cricketer &lt;a href=\"Usman%20Khawaja\"&gt;Usman Khawaja&lt;/a&gt; and academic &lt;a href=\"Waleed%20Aly\"&gt;Waleed Aly&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, Labor MP &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Husic\"&gt;Ed Husic&lt;/a&gt; became Australia's first Muslim member of &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;Cabinet&lt;/a&gt;, briefly serving as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and for Broadband in the short lived &lt;a href=\"Rudd%20Government%20%282013%29\"&gt;Second Rudd Government&lt;/a&gt;.\nJudaism.\nAt least eight &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"convict\"&gt;convict&lt;/a&gt;s are believed to have been &lt;a href=\"penal%20transportation\"&gt;transported&lt;/a&gt; to Sydney aboard the &lt;a href=\"First%20Fleet\"&gt;First Fleet&lt;/a&gt; in 1788, when the first British settlement was established on the continent. An estimated 110,000 Jews currently live in Australia, the majority being &lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi%20Jews\"&gt;Ashkenazi Jews&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;an descent, with many being refugees and &lt;a href=\"Holocaust\"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; survivors who arrived during and after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Jewish population has increased slightly in recent times due to immigration from South Africa and the former &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. The largest Jewish community in Australia is in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, with about 60,000, followed by Sydney with about 45,000 members. Smaller communities are dispersed among the other state capitals.\nFollowing the conclusion of the British colonial period, Jews have enjoyed formal equality before the law in Australia and have not been subject to civil &lt;a href=\"Disabilities%20%28Jewish%29\"&gt;disabilities&lt;/a&gt; or other forms of state-sponsored &lt;a href=\"anti-Semitism\"&gt;anti-Semitism&lt;/a&gt; which exclude them from full participation in public life.\nSydney's gothic design &lt;a href=\"Great%20Synagogue%20%28Sydney%29\"&gt;Great Synagogue&lt;/a&gt;, consecrated in 1878, is a notable place of Jewish worship in Australia. Notable Australian Jews have included the Sir &lt;a href=\"John%20Monash\"&gt;John Monash&lt;/a&gt;, the notable World War I general who opened the Maccabean Hall in Sydney in 1923 to commemorate Jews who fought and died in the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; and who is currently featured on the Australian $100 note; and Sir &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Isaacs\"&gt;Isaac Isaacs&lt;/a&gt; who became the first Australian born governor general in 1930. Sir &lt;a href=\"Zelman%20Cowen\"&gt;Zelman Cowen&lt;/a&gt; also served as Governor-General, between 1977 and 1982. The &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Jewish%20Museum\"&gt;Sydney Jewish Museum&lt;/a&gt; opened in 1992 to commemorate &lt;a href=\"The%20Holocaust\"&gt;The Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; \"challenge visitors' perceptions of democracy, morality, social justice and human rights\".\nUntil the 1930s, all synagogues in Australia were nominally &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20Judaism\"&gt;Orthodox&lt;/a&gt;, with most acknowledging leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Rabbi%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. To this day the vast majority of synagogues in Australia are Orthodox. However, there is a wide range of Orthodox congregations, including &lt;a href=\"Mizrachi%20%28religious%20Zionism%29\"&gt;Mizrachi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chabad\"&gt;Chabad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adass%20Israel\"&gt;Adass Israel&lt;/a&gt; congregations. There are also &lt;a href=\"Sephardi\"&gt;Sephardi&lt;/a&gt; congregations.\nThere had been short-lived efforts to establish &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Judaism\"&gt;Reform&lt;/a&gt; congregations as early as the 1890s. However, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Ada%20Phillips\"&gt;Ada Phillips&lt;/a&gt;, a sustained liberal congregation, &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Beth%20Israel%20%28Melbourne%2C%20Australia%29\"&gt;Temple Beth Israel&lt;/a&gt;, was established in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, another synagogue linked to the United States &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Movement\"&gt;Reform Movement&lt;/a&gt;, Temple Emanuel, was established in &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. Following these two congregations, a number of other Liberal synagogues have been founded in other cities.\nSince 1992 &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Judaism\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; (Masorti) services have been held as an alternative service usually in the Neuweg, the smaller second synagogue within Temple Emanuel, Woollahra, Sydney. In 1999, &lt;a href=\"Kehilat%20Nitzan\"&gt;Kehilat Nitzan&lt;/a&gt;, Melbourne's first Conservative (Masorti) congregation was established, with foundation president &lt;a href=\"John%20Rosenberg%20%28academic%29\"&gt;John Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;. The congregation appointed its first rabbi, &lt;a href=\"Ehud%20Bandel\"&gt;Ehud Bandel&lt;/a&gt; in 2006. In 2010 Beit Knesset Shalom became Brisbane's first Conservative (Masorti) synagogue.\nIn 2012, the first &lt;a href=\"Humanistic%20Judaism\"&gt;humanistic Jewish&lt;/a&gt; congregation, known as Kehilat Kolenu, was established in Melbourne with links to the cultural Jewish youth movement &lt;a href=\"Habonim%20Dror\"&gt;Habonim Dror&lt;/a&gt;. Later in 2012, a similar congregation was established in Sydney, known as Ayelet HaShachar. The services are loosely based on the Humanistic Jewish movement in the United States and the musical-prayer group Nava Tehila in Israel.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith&lt;/a&gt; first arrived in Australia in 1922, and at less than 0.1% of the total population, is one of the smaller religious minorities. The &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Temple\"&gt;Sydney Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Temple&lt;/a&gt; is situated in &lt;a href=\"Ingleside%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Ingleside&lt;/a&gt;, a northern suburb of &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Jennifer%20Taylor%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Jennifer Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, a historian at &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20University\"&gt;Sydney University&lt;/a&gt;, it is among Sydney's four most significant religious buildings constructed in the twentieth century. Dedicated in 1961, it was also the world's fourth &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20House%20of%20Worship\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship&lt;/a&gt; to be completed.\nThe 1996 &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Census\"&gt;Australian Census&lt;/a&gt; lists Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed membership at just under 9,000. In 2001, the second edition of \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Practical%20Reference%20to%20Religious%20Diversity%20for%20Operational%20Police%20and%20Emergency%20Services\"&gt;A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services&lt;/a&gt;\" added the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith to its coverage of religions in Australia and noted that the community had grown to over 11,000. The &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Religion%20Data%20Archives\"&gt;Association of Religion Data Archives&lt;/a&gt; (relying on \"&lt;a href=\"World%20Christian%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;World Christian Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;\") estimated some 17,700 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2005, and over 19,300 in 2010. However, census data from 2016 reported a much lower population of only 13,988.\nIndian/Dharmic religions.\nHinduism.\n&lt;a href=\"Hinduism%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Hindus&lt;/a&gt; number 440,300 according to the 2016 census, making &lt;a href=\"Hinduism%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt; the fifth largest and the second fastest growing religion in Australia (12.0% per year since 2011). In the 19th century, &lt;a href=\"Hinduism%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Hindus&lt;/a&gt; first came to Australia to work on cotton and sugar &lt;a href=\"plantations\"&gt;plantations&lt;/a&gt;. Many who remained worked in small business, as camel drivers, merchants and &lt;a href=\"hawker%20%28trade%29\"&gt;hawkers&lt;/a&gt;, selling goods between small rural communities. Their population increased dramatically from the 1960s and 1970s and more than doubled between the 1996 and 2006 census to around 148,000 people. Most were migrants from countries such as &lt;a href=\"Hinduism%20in%20Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, India, &lt;a href=\"Hinduism%20in%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hinduism%20in%20Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hinduism%20in%20Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hinduism%20in%20South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. At present many Hindus are well-educated professionals in fields such as medicine, engineering, commerce and information technology. Among Australia's best-known Hindus is the singer &lt;a href=\"Kamahl\"&gt;Kamahl&lt;/a&gt;. There are around forty-three &lt;a href=\"Hinduism%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; temples in Australia, the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Mandir%20Temple\"&gt;Sri Mandir Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Auburn%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;Auburn, Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, being the first temple. It was established in 1977 to meet the needs of the growing &lt;a href=\"Hinduism%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; community.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhists began arriving in Australia in significant numbers during the &lt;a href=\"goldrush\"&gt;goldrush&lt;/a&gt; of the 1850s with an influx of Chinese miners. However, the population remained low until the 1960s. Buddhism is now one of the fastest growing religions in Australia. Immigration from Asia has contributed to this, but some people of non-Asian origin have also converted. The three main traditions of Buddhism\u2014&lt;a href=\"Theravada\"&gt;Theravada&lt;/a&gt;, East Asian and &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20Buddhism\"&gt;Tibetan&lt;/a&gt;\u2014are now represented in Australia. According to the 2016 census, Buddhism has 563,700 adherents, or 2.4% of the total population.\nBuddhist temples can be very active. Quang Minh Temple in &lt;a href=\"Braybrook%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Braybrook&lt;/a&gt;, Melbourne, Victoria gets about 2,000 people through every Sunday and gives a free vegetarian meal to about 600 people. For important events, more than 20,000 people come. Even more come to the &lt;a href=\"Nan%20Tien%20Temple\"&gt;Nan Tien Temple&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Southern Paradise Temple\", in &lt;a href=\"Wollongong\"&gt;Wollongong&lt;/a&gt;, New South Wales, began construction in the early 1990s, adopting the Chinese palace building style and is now the largest Buddhist temple in the Southern Hemisphere. This temple follows the Venerable Master &lt;a href=\"Hsing%20Yun\"&gt;Hsing Yun&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fo%20Guang%20Shan\"&gt;Fo Guang Shan&lt;/a&gt; Buddhist order. &lt;a href=\"Bodhinyana\"&gt;Bodhinyana Monastery&lt;/a&gt; is a Theravadin Buddhist monastery in the &lt;a href=\"Thai%20Forest%20Tradition\"&gt;Thai Forest Tradition&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Serpentine%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Serpentine, Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSikhism.\n&lt;a href=\"Sikhism\"&gt;Sikhism&lt;/a&gt; is currently the fastest growing religion in Australia. According to census data, Australia's Sikh population grew from 72,000 to 126,000 between 2011 and 2016, an average growth rate of 14.8% per year. Around 42% of Australia's Sikhs live in the state of &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;.\nJainism.\n&lt;a href=\"Jainism\"&gt;Jainism&lt;/a&gt; is currently the fourth fastest growing religion in Australia, recording 4,050 adherents in 2016 and growing an average of 7.7% per year. The overwhelming majority (94.7%) of Jains live inside the state capitals, primarily Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.\nIrreligion.\nNon-religious.\nAustralia is one of the least religious nations in the developed world, with religion not described as a central part in many people's lives. This view is prominent among Australia's youth, who were ranked as the least religious worldwide in a 2008 survey conducted by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor\"&gt;The Christian Science Monitor&lt;/a&gt;\". In the 2016 census, the ABS categorised 7,040,700 Australians (30.1%) as having no religion, up from 4,796,800 (22.3%) in 2011. This category includes &lt;a href=\"agnosticism\"&gt;agnosticism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"atheism\"&gt;atheism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"humanism\"&gt;humanism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rationalism\"&gt;rationalism&lt;/a&gt;, and people who are &lt;a href=\"irreligion\"&gt;unaffiliated&lt;/a&gt; with any particular religion.\nAtheism.\nWhile people with no religion are more than 30% of the Australian population, the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not provide information in the annual \"1301.0 \u2013 Year Book Australia\" on religious affiliation as to how many people fall into each sub-category. Data on religious affiliation is only collected by the ABS at the five yearly population census. Atheist interests in Australia are represented nationally by the &lt;a href=\"Atheist%20Foundation%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Atheist Foundation of Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Humanist interests in Australia are represented nationally by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Australian%20Humanist%20Societies\"&gt;Council of Australian Humanist Societies&lt;/a&gt;. Rationalist interests in Australia are represented nationally by the &lt;a href=\"Rationalist%20Society%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Rationalist Society of Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Global%20Atheist%20Convention\"&gt;Global Atheist Convention&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent atheist event, has been held in Melbourne.\nOther religions.\nThe 2006 census shows 53 listed groups down to 5000 members, most of them Christian denominations, many of them national versions such as &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Orthodox\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Orthodox\"&gt;Serbian Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Assyrian&lt;/a&gt; Orthodox. Of the smaller religions, &lt;a href=\"Pagan\"&gt;Pagan&lt;/a&gt; religions 29,328, the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith&lt;/a&gt; at 12,000, &lt;a href=\"Humanism\"&gt;Humanism&lt;/a&gt; about 7000. Between 1000 and 5000, are the following religions\u2014&lt;a href=\"Taoism\"&gt;Taoism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druze\"&gt;Druse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Satanism\"&gt;Satanism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zoroastrian\"&gt;Zoroastrian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rationalism\"&gt;Rationalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Creativity%20Alliance\"&gt;Creativity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29\"&gt;Theosophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jainism\"&gt;Jainism&lt;/a&gt;. There are also adherents of &lt;a href=\"Tenrikyo\"&gt;Tenrikyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shinto\"&gt;Shinto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unitarian%20Universalism\"&gt;Unitarian Universalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eckankar\"&gt;Eckankar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cao%20%C4%90%C3%A0i\"&gt;Cao Dai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rastafari\"&gt;Rastafari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pantheism\"&gt;Pantheism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scientology\"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raelianism\"&gt;Raelianism&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn general, non-Christian religions and those with no religion have been growing in proportion to the overall population. With fewer classifications, data from 1996 and 2001 showed &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20religion\"&gt;Aboriginal religion&lt;/a&gt; decreasing from 7000 to 5000 while Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed grew from just under 9,000 to over 11,000 and the rest of the \"Other\" category growing from about 69,000 to about 92,000.\nPaganism.\n&lt;a href=\"Alexandrian%20Wicca\"&gt;Alexandrian Wicca&lt;/a&gt;ns and &lt;a href=\"Gardnerian%20Wicca\"&gt;Gardnerian Wicca&lt;/a&gt;ns arrived in Australia from England and the United States around the late 1960s.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Australian%20Census\"&gt;2011 census&lt;/a&gt;, 32,083 Australians identified their religion as a &lt;a href=\"Contemporary%20Paganism\"&gt;Pagan&lt;/a&gt; religion including 8,413 people who identified their religion as &lt;a href=\"Wicca\"&gt;Wicca&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Witchcraft%20%28contemporary%29\"&gt;Witchcraft&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterfaith efforts.\nInterfaith efforts between various religious institutions occur. Since the early 2000s, the &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Conference\"&gt;Abraham Conference&lt;/a&gt; convenes as an annual interfaith event between Christians, Muslims, and Jews."
