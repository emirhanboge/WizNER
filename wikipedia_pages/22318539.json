    "text": "John Charles O'Connor (December 1, 1891 \u2013 May 30, 1982) was a &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; player. Nicknamed \"Bucky\", he played one game at &lt;a href=\"catcher\"&gt;catcher&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; on September 16, 1916. O'Connor replaced the Cubs' &lt;a href=\"Rowdy%20Elliott\"&gt;Rowdy Elliott&lt;/a&gt; after he \"split\" his finger on a foul tip. The Cubs' other catchers, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Archer\"&gt;Jimmy Archer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Art%20Wilson\"&gt;Art Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, were themselves injured. O'Connor caught one inning until Wilson, who had been sitting in the &lt;a href=\"grandstand\"&gt;grandstand&lt;/a&gt;, then \"limped\" to the Cubs' &lt;a href=\"Changing%20room\"&gt;clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; to put on his uniform, replaced O'Connor and finished the game."
