    "text": "\"Hot Summer\" is a song by German pop group &lt;a href=\"Monrose\"&gt;Monrose&lt;/a&gt;. It was written and produced by Danish musicians &lt;a href=\"Remee\"&gt;Remee Sigvardt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Troelsen\"&gt;Thomas Troelsen&lt;/a&gt; and recorded by the trio for their second studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Strictly%20Physical%20%28album%29\"&gt;Strictly Physical&lt;/a&gt;\" (2007). A &lt;a href=\"dance-pop\"&gt;dance-pop&lt;/a&gt; song with heavy elements of &lt;a href=\"electropop\"&gt;electropop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sprechgesang\"&gt;sprechgesang&lt;/a&gt;, it was selected out of sereral hundreds of songs and set much of the tone of its parent album, which was chiefly produced by Remee and Troelsen. \"Hot Summer\" also introduced a stronger dance pop edge to Monrose's overall sound. Lyrically, it features a female protagonist expressing her desire for her &lt;a href=\"love%20interest\"&gt;love interest&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased as the band's third single and \"Strictly Physical\"s leading single on 29 June 2007 in &lt;a href=\"German-speaking%20Europe\"&gt;German-speaking Europe&lt;/a&gt;, \"Hot Summer\" became the band's second non-consecutive number-one hit within a stretch of seven month, reaching the top of the charts of &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"German%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Hitparade\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. It eventually emerged as one of the biggest-selling songs of the year on German &lt;a href=\"online%20music%20store\"&gt;online music store&lt;/a&gt;s, and moreover, garnered the group success in Finland, the Netherlands, and Slovenia, where it served as the band's musical debut. For sales in excess of 150,000 copies, \"Hot Summer\" was certified gold in Austria and Germany.\nBackground and recording.\n\"Hot Summer\" was written and produced by Danish musicians &lt;a href=\"Remee\"&gt;Remee Sigvardt Jackman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Troelsen\"&gt;Thomas Troelsen&lt;/a&gt;. It is one out of several songs they contributed to Monrose's second album \"Strictly Physical\" (2007) and marked one of their first songs as a collaborative duo. Much of it was created at the Delta Lab White recording studios in &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen%2C%20Denmark\"&gt;Copenhagen, Denmark&lt;/a&gt; in fall 2006. Remee also provided backing vocals and rap parts on the song, while Troelsen played &lt;a href=\"Keyboard%20instrument\"&gt;keyboard&lt;/a&gt;s and oversaw the programming of \"Hot Summer\". Vocals by &lt;a href=\"Monrose\"&gt;Monrose&lt;/a&gt; members &lt;a href=\"Mandy%20Capristo\"&gt;Mandy Capristo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Senna%20Gammour\"&gt;Senna Gammour&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bahar%20Kizil\"&gt;Bahar Kizil&lt;/a&gt; were eventually recorded by Claus \u00dcblacker at the Weryton Studios in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;, Germany.\nThe song was selected out of a total of three hundred songs for inclusion on \"Strictly Physical\" (2007). Monrose cited its uptempo nature as a reason for their selection and described it as a perfect \"good mood song.\" An instant favorite of the band, \"Hot Summer\" was eventually picked as the lead single from \"Strictly Physical\" since they considered it a fitting break away from the &lt;a href=\"ballad\"&gt;ballad&lt;/a&gt; stereotype that they had established with the release of their singles \"&lt;a href=\"Shame%20%28Monrose%20song%29\"&gt;Shame&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Even%20Heaven%20Cries\"&gt;Even Heaven Cries&lt;/a&gt;\". Band member &lt;a href=\"Senna%20Gammour\"&gt;Senna Gammour&lt;/a&gt; further elaborated in an interview with the band's official website: \"The song is cool and sexy and goes straight into your dancing legs, [it's] our contribution to great summer parties.\" She also discussed the 1980s influences and &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house music&lt;/a&gt; elements of the record. &lt;a href=\"Mandy%20Capristo\"&gt;Mandy Capristo&lt;/a&gt; called the song a \"&lt;a href=\"promise\"&gt;promise&lt;/a&gt;\" and added: \"It instantly raises your spirits, no matter if you're sitting in your car, dancing on the floor or eating ice-cream \u2014 \"Hot Summer\" is just brimful of life.\"\nRelease and reception.\n\"Hot Summer\" received a generally positive reception from music critics who complimented the song for its hit qualities as well as Monrose's decision to break away from the pop sound of previous releases. Julia D\u00f6rfler from &lt;a href=\"laut.de\"&gt;laut.de&lt;/a&gt; wrote that it \"clearly has hit qualities.\" Similarly, music magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Gruner%20%2B%20Jahr\"&gt;Musikwoche&lt;/a&gt;\" declared the song a \"&lt;a href=\"summer%20hit\"&gt;summer hit&lt;/a&gt;.\" In his review for cdstarts.de, Albert Ranner compared it favorably to Canadian singer &lt;a href=\"Nelly%20Furtado\"&gt;Nelly Furtado&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Maneater%20%28Nelly%20Furtado%20song%29\"&gt;Maneater&lt;/a&gt;\" (2006). He called the record \"extremly danceable.\"\nAlthough a twenty-second clip of \"Hot Summer\" was previewed on the &lt;a href=\"ProSieben\"&gt;ProSieben&lt;/a&gt; network's daily gossip television magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Taff%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;taff&lt;/a&gt;\" on 24 May 2007, the full song was not premiered until Monrose's performance during the season finale of the &lt;a href=\"Germany%27s%20Next%20Topmodel%2C%20Cycle%202\"&gt;second cycle&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Germany%27s%20Next%20Topmodel\"&gt;Germany's Next Topmodel&lt;/a&gt;\" a few hours later.
