    "text": "Caroline Rose Hunt (January 8, 1923 \u2013 November 13, 2018) was an American heiress and hotelier who was at one time the wealthiest woman in the United States. She is known for having been the founder of &lt;a href=\"Rosewood%20Hotels%20%26amp%3B%20Resorts\"&gt;Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts&lt;/a&gt;, which she opened in 1979.\nEarly life.\nCaroline Rose Hunt was born on January 8, 1923, the daughter of oilman &lt;a href=\"H.%20L.%20Hunt\"&gt;H. L. Hunt&lt;/a&gt; (1889\u20131974) and Lyda Bunker (1889\u20131955). She had six siblings: &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Hunt%20Hill\"&gt;Margaret Hunt Hill&lt;/a&gt; (1915\u20132007), &lt;a href=\"H.%20L.%20Hunt%20III\"&gt;H. L. Hunt III&lt;/a&gt; (1917\u20132005), Lyda Bunker Hunt (born and died in 1925), &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20Bunker%20Hunt\"&gt;Nelson Bunker Hunt&lt;/a&gt; (1926\u20132014), &lt;a href=\"William%20Herbert%20Hunt\"&gt;William Herbert Hunt&lt;/a&gt; (born 1929), and &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Hunt\"&gt;Lamar Hunt&lt;/a&gt; (1932\u20132006). While she was growing up, the family lived in the &lt;a href=\"east%20Texas\"&gt;east Texas&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Tyler%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Tyler&lt;/a&gt;. Hunt said that as a child, she was unaware of the family's wealth until she found a \"Life\" magazine picture of her father, \"with a caption that asked, 'Is this the richest man in the world?' \"\nShe was educated at the &lt;a href=\"Hockaday%20School\"&gt;Hockaday School&lt;/a&gt;, an all-girl boarding school in Dallas. She then attended &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Baldwin%20College\"&gt;Mary Baldwin College&lt;/a&gt;, a private &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20colleges%20in%20the%20Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;women's college&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Staunton, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, for two years, until she transferred to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin\"&gt;University of Texas at Austin&lt;/a&gt;, where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and art history.\nCareer.\nPrior to her first marriage, Hunt worked in her father's Dallas office. She later worked as a sales clerk at the &lt;a href=\"Neiman%20Marcus\"&gt;Neiman Marcus&lt;/a&gt; department store in Dallas. During her first marriage and through much of her second, she focused on her family and charitable work, not holding any job outside the home until she entered the hotel business at age 55.\nIn 1980, she opened &lt;a href=\"The%20Mansion%20Restaurant\"&gt;The Mansion Restaurant&lt;/a&gt; on Turtle Creek (later known as the Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek), a luxury hotel in &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20Creek%2C%20Dallas\"&gt;Dallas' Turtle Creek neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; that includes an adjoining restaurant housed in a 1925 Italian Renaissance mansion built by cotton baron Sheppard King and later owned by oilman Toddie Lee Wynne. That same year, Hunt founded &lt;a href=\"Rosewood%20Hotels%20%26amp%3B%20Resorts\"&gt;Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts&lt;/a&gt;, where she served as Honorary Chairman at the time of her death. The company owned the &lt;a href=\"Hotel%20Bel-Air\"&gt;Hotel Bel-Air&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bel%20Air%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Bel Air, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, but sold it in 1989. It currently owns the &lt;a href=\"Carlyle%20Hotel\"&gt;Carlyle Hotel&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20East%20Side\"&gt;Upper East Side&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, among a portfolio of other luxury hotels.

At one time, The Mansion provided Lady Primrose toiletries in its guest rooms. When Rosewood opened its first hotel in London, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lanesborough\"&gt;The Lanesborough&lt;/a&gt;, Hunt used her travel experience scouring the English countryside for antiques to aid her in assuaging fears in the London press that the expensive new hotel overlooking &lt;a href=\"Buckingham%20Palace\"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt; would not fit into London traditions rather than \u2014 in the words of one American writer \u2014 \"a purely American hotel with tent cards on the tables and American waiters introducing themselves with [...] 'Hi, y'all, my name is Steve.' \"\nIn 2000, she wrote a novel, \"Primrose Past: The 1848 Journal of Young Lady Primrose\". She also wrote two cookbooks. Because of her hotels, the acclaim for the restaurant of The Mansion on Turtle Creek, and her cookbooks, she was a member of the Dallas chapter of &lt;a href=\"Les%20Dames%20d%27Escoffier\"&gt;Les Dames d'Escoffier&lt;/a&gt;, a professional organization for women involved in the food, wine, and hospitality industries;.
