    "text": "The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Japan begins after a few mentions of the country by &lt;a href=\"%CA%BBAbdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1\"&gt;\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; first in 1875. Japanese contact with the religion came from the West when was living in &lt;a href=\"Honolulu\"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;, Hawaii in 1902 converted; the second being .\nIn 1914 two Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, George Jacob Augur and &lt;a href=\"Agnes%20Baldwin%20Alexander\"&gt;Agnes Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, and their families, &lt;a href=\"Pioneering%20%28Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%29\"&gt;pioneered&lt;/a&gt; to Japan. Alexander would live some 31 years off and on in Japan until 1967 when she left for the last time. The first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed convert on Japanese soil was in 1915. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 undertook several trips in 1911-1912 and met Japanese travelers in Western cities, in Paris, London, and New York. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 met Fujita in Chicago and Yamamoto in San Francisco.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 wrote a series of letters, or &lt;a href=\"tablets%20%28religious%29\"&gt;tablets&lt;/a&gt;, in 1916-1917 compiled together in the book titled \"&lt;a href=\"Tablets%20of%20the%20Divine%20Plan\"&gt;Tablets of the Divine Plan&lt;/a&gt;\" but which was not presented in the United States until 1919. Fujita would serve between the World Wars first in the household of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and then of Shoghi Effendi. In 1932 the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed &lt;a href=\"Local%20Spiritual%20Assembly\"&gt;Local Spiritual Assembly&lt;/a&gt; was elected in Tokyo and reelected in 1933. In all of Japan there were 19 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds.\nIn 1937 Alexander went on &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20pilgrimage\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt; to return years later. In 1938 Fujita was excused from his services in Haifa out of fears for his safety during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and returned to Japan until 1956. In 1942, back in the United States, the Yamamoto family lived at a &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20American%20internment\"&gt;relocation camp&lt;/a&gt; during the war. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Americans associated with the &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Japan\"&gt;American Occupation Forces&lt;/a&gt; reconnected the Japanese Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community \u2014 Michael Jamir found Fujita by 1946 and Robert Imagire helped re-elect the assembly in Tokyo in 1948. In 1963 the statistics of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed communities showed 13 assemblies and other smaller groups.\nIn 1968 Japanese Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds began to travel outside Japan. In 1971 the first residents of Okinawa converted to the religion. In 1991 the community organized an affiliate of the &lt;a href=\"Association%20for%20Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Studies\"&gt;Association for Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Studies&lt;/a&gt; in Japan which has since held annual conferences, published newsletters, and published and coordinated academic work across affiliates. The &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Religion%20Data%20Archives\"&gt;Association of Religion Data Archives&lt;/a&gt; (relying on &lt;a href=\"World%20Christian%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;World Christian Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;) estimated some 15650 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2005 while the &lt;a href=\"CIA%20World%20Factbook\"&gt;CIA World Factbook&lt;/a&gt; estimated about 12000 Japanese Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2006.\nEarly period.\nThe first mention of Japan in &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20literature\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed literature&lt;/a&gt; is with the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20of%20Divine%20Civilization\"&gt;Secret of Divine Civilization&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=\"%CA%BBAbdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1\"&gt;\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; in 1875. It was written to try to enlighten &lt;a href=\"Persia\"&gt;Persia&lt;/a&gt;. It says:\n\u2026the government of Japan was in the beginning subject to and under the protection of China, and that now for some years, Japan has opened its eyes and adopted the techniques of contemporary progress and civilization, promoting sciences and industries of use to the public, and striving to the utmost of their power and competence until public opinion was focused on reform. This government has currently advanced to such a point that, although its population is only one-sixth, or even one-tenth, that of China, it has recently challenged the latter government, and China has finally been forced to come to terms. Observe carefully how education and the arts of civilization bring honor, prosperity, independence and freedom to a government and its people.\nFirsts.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds moved across Asia from the turn of the century. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds were in &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; in 1902, &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith%20in%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; by 1944, &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith%20in%20Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Canton&lt;/a&gt; in 1923, and &lt;a href=\"Macau\"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt; in 1953. However, for the Japanese contact with the religion came from the West. &lt;a href=\"Kanichi%20Yamamoto\"&gt;Kanichi Yamamoto&lt;/a&gt; was living in &lt;a href=\"Honolulu\"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;, Hawaii in 1902 where a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, Elizabeth Muther, introduced him to the religion. Yamamoto wrote a letter to &lt;a href=\"%CA%BBAbdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1\"&gt;\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; and enters the history books as the first Japanese Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed \u2014 the second and third being &lt;a href=\"Saichiro%20Fujita\"&gt;Saichiro Fujita&lt;/a&gt; and Kenzo Torikai. The first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds to visit Japan were &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Remey\"&gt;Mason Remey&lt;/a&gt; and Howard C. Struve on December 27, 1909 who addressed an audience at a Tokyo &lt;a href=\"YMCA\"&gt;YMCA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"D.%20T.%20Suzuki\"&gt;D. T. Suzuki&lt;/a&gt;'s wife, Beatrice, had multiple contacts with the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds both in America and in Japan and was for a time considered a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed. &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Leach\"&gt;Bernard Leach&lt;/a&gt; lived in Japan from 1909-1920 working on the &lt;a href=\"Mingei\"&gt;Mingei&lt;/a&gt; arts and converted to the religion in 1940. Leach received awards for his continued work in Japanese folk arts in the 1960s and 70s. A few other Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds traveled through Japan in 1911 and 1914. But in 1914 two Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, George Jacob Augur and &lt;a href=\"Agnes%20Baldwin%20Alexander\"&gt;Agnes Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, and their families, &lt;a href=\"Pioneering%20%28Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%29\"&gt;pioneered&lt;/a&gt; to Japan. Alexander would live some 31 years off and on in Japan until 1967 when she left for the last time and much of her work would be through &lt;a href=\"Esperantist\"&gt;Esperantist&lt;/a&gt;s and connections with the &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt; community of Japan. Meetings for the public were set up and talks and interviews were given including to &lt;a href=\"Esperantist\"&gt;Esperantist&lt;/a&gt; audiences. The first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed convert on Japanese soil was &lt;a href=\"Kikutaro%20Fukuta\"&gt;Kikutaro Fukuta&lt;/a&gt; in 1915, followed by the blind Russian youth &lt;a href=\"Vasily%20Eroshenko\"&gt;Vasily Eroshenko&lt;/a&gt; who later drifted to communism. Also in 1915, &lt;a href=\"Martha%20Root\"&gt;Martha Root&lt;/a&gt; arrived for the first time in Japan and &lt;a href=\"Tokujiro%20Torii\"&gt;Tokujiro Torii&lt;/a&gt; converted to the religion. Torrii later served as president of the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Blind%20Association\"&gt;Japanese Blind Association&lt;/a&gt; and received an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Citation%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;Imperial Citation&lt;/a&gt;, the Medal of the Third Order, for his work on behalf of the blind.\nCities where Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds traveled in this early phase include &lt;a href=\"Kobe\"&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kyoto\"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hiroshima\"&gt;Hiroshima&lt;/a&gt; and this period also saw the first observances of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Holy Days of &lt;a href=\"Naw%20Ruz\"&gt;Naw Ruz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A1b%23Declaration%20to%20Mull.C3.A1%20Husayn\"&gt;Declaration of the B\u00e1b&lt;/a&gt;. In the spring of 1916 Fukuta and Eroshenko made the first contributions towards raising the first &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20House%20of%20Worship\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship&lt;/a&gt; being raised in Wilmette, Illinois, USA. In the summer of 1916 Eroshenko took a copy of &lt;a href=\"Some%20Answered%20Questions\"&gt;Some Answered Questions&lt;/a&gt; with him when he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Siam\"&gt;Siam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burma\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;. The first Japanese woman to convert to the religion was Yuri Mochizuki in 1919. Shortly before the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in 1921, Alexander and Oh Sang Sun made a trip from Japan to Korea, then under Japanese rule, for the first entry of the religion in that country. Alexander also spent time with &lt;a href=\"Shibusawa%20Eiichi\"&gt;Shibusawa Eiichi&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere Fujita served as a secretary to &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%ADyyih%20Kh%C3%A1num\"&gt;Bah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num&lt;/a&gt; in communicating the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in late 1921. At a time when women speaking in public was rare, two women, a Miss Mochizuki and Haruko Mori, spoke at the memorial service of the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 held in Japan.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 meets.\nThe Japanese Ambassador to Spain was staying in Paris when \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 stayed there on his 1911 trip to the west and they met and had a prolonged conversation. In London in 1912, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 came in contact with the President of the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Women%27s%20University\"&gt;Japan Women's University&lt;/a&gt;. It was this occasion that \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 wrote the only prayer he wrote for the Japanese. It says:\nO God! The darkness of contention, strife and warfare between the religious, the nations and the people has beclouded the horizon of Reality and hidden the heaven of Truth! The world is in need of the light of Guidance! Therefore, O God! Confer Thy favor so that the Sun of Reality may illumine the East and the West.\nIn New York he met several Japanese as well. On September 12, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 reached Chicago. Fujita attempted to connect with \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 at Cleveland but caught up with him in Chicago. Fujita would accompany \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 across many American cities including Kenosha, Wisconsin, St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota, Denver and Glenwood Springs, Colorado, Salt Lake City, Utah, and San Francisco and Stanford, California - Fujita would serve between the World Wars first in the household of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and then of Shoghi Effendi. On October 22, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 reached San Francisco where he met Yamamoto who arranged for a presentation among a Japanese audience in Oakland.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 writes to Japan and Korea.\nIn all \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 wrote 18 tablets to Japanese living in Japan, and the last one was to the Koreans dated November 5, 1921. Eighteen of the nineteen Tablets were addressed to young people, and seven of these to girls of Tokyo. It is remarkable that the only Tablets to women in Asia were to three Japanese girls: Yuri Mochizuki who received three Tablets, Haruko Mori and Mikae Komatsu, each received one, and the group of girls who were sent two Tablets. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 made mentioned especially to the blind of Japan. He addressed five Tablets to three blind men.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's Tablets of the Divine Plan.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 wrote a series of letters, or &lt;a href=\"tablets%20%28religious%29\"&gt;tablets&lt;/a&gt;, to the followers of the religion in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in 1916-1917 suggesting Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds take the religion to many places; these letters were compiled together in the book titled &lt;a href=\"Tablets%20of%20the%20Divine%20Plan\"&gt;Tablets of the Divine Plan&lt;/a&gt; but were delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 \u2014 after the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20flu\"&gt;Spanish flu&lt;/a&gt;. These tablets were translated and presented by &lt;a href=\"Mirza%20Ahmad%20Sohrab\"&gt;Mirza Ahmad Sohrab&lt;/a&gt; on April 4, 1919, and published in \"&lt;a href=\"Star%20of%20the%20West%20%28Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20magazine%29\"&gt;Star of the West&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine on December 12, 1919. One tablet says in part:\nO that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of \"Y\u00e1 Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'l-Abh\u00e1\" in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it.\u2026\n\u2026if some teachers go to other islands and other parts, such as the continent of &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, Tasmania, also to Japan, &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire%23Government%20and%20administration%23Provincial%20administration\"&gt;Asiatic Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"French%20Indochina\"&gt;French Indochina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siam\"&gt;Siam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Straits%20Settlements\"&gt;Straits Settlements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith%20in%20India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ceylon\"&gt;Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, most great results will be forthcoming.\nGrowth to WW II.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Japan were witness to, and participated in the relief effort of, the &lt;a href=\"1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake\"&gt;1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. Moneys and letters of concern arrived from Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in New York, Haifa, Kenosha, Wi., Brooklyn, Chicago, Somerville, Mass., Montreal, Canada among other places spreading encouragement and reporting on or actually sending funds Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds and others had marshaled for the relief effort. In 1927 &lt;a href=\"Hands%20of%20the%20Cause%23Appointments%23First%20contingent%2C%20appointed%2024%20December%201951%20by%20Shoghi%20Effendi\"&gt;Siegfried Schopflocher&lt;/a&gt; visited Japan and reported the religion was firmly established and progressing.\nIn 1932 the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed &lt;a href=\"Local%20Spiritual%20Assembly\"&gt;Local Spiritual Assembly&lt;/a&gt; was elected in Tokyo. There was a preliminary election that corrected when Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, specified rules that needed to be followed for the election. The members of the community of Tokyo were (former Rev.) Sempo Ito; Yuri Mochizuki Furukawa; Otoe Murakami; Kanae Takeshita; Mr. Y. Kataoka (first name unknown); Keiji Sawada; Agnes Alexander; Antoinette Naganuma; Mr. Nakanishi (first name unknown); Hidehiko Matsuda; and Keiko Eito. The first nine names were elected to the provisional Local Spiritual Assembly but the later official election changed adding Mr. Matsuda, who took the place of Mr. Y. Kataoka, who asked to be relieved. The members included five women and two who were blind. The assembly was reelected in 1933. In all of Japan there were 19 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds. In 1916 Daiun Inouye was a young Buddhist priest when he first heard of the religion. In 1932 he translated &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20literature%23Bibliography%23Other%20authors%23Esslemont%2C%20J.E.\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and the New Era&lt;/a&gt; and it was printed the following year. In 1937 he resigned from the priesthood and wrote that he would be free to spend his time propagating the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nStarting in the 1920s, Alexander began various trips and coming contact with public figures in Japan and some publications reached a broader audience. In 1923 Alexander first visited Hong Kong and returned on several more over the next thirty years. Alexander also accompanied Root on one of her return trips to the area - this time on a trip to China and Alexander made contacts among the Chinese, especially from Canton and Shanghai, who visited Japan as well. In 1928 seven specially bound volumes of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed books were presented for the coronation of the emperor &lt;a href=\"Hirohito\"&gt;Hirohito&lt;/a&gt; and were part of his library and at the Enthronement Ceremonies of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan three foreigners were invited to speak, including Alexander as a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed representative. In 1932 Esperantist Tadashi Watanabe invited Alexander to talk about the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and Esperanto first in &lt;a href=\"Tomakomai\"&gt;Tomakomai&lt;/a&gt;, and then the then-village of &lt;a href=\"Yamabe%20Station\"&gt;Yamabe&lt;/a&gt;, Hokkaido.\nCrisis of WW II.\nIn 1937 Alexander went on &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20pilgrimage\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt; and, aware of the impossibility of returning to Japan during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to other countries. In 1938 Fujita was excused from his services in Haifa out of fears for his safety during the war and returned to Japan until circa 1956. In 1942 back in the United States the Yamamoto family lived at a &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20American%20internment\"&gt;relocation camp&lt;/a&gt; during the war. Two children \u2014 one from Nagasaki and one from Hiroshima \u2014 later converted to the religion and have shared their story.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Americans associated with the &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Japan\"&gt;American Occupation Forces&lt;/a&gt; reconnected the Japanese Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community: They were Michael Jamir, Lorraine Wright, and Robert Imagire. Jamir in particular undertook trips to find Torii and Fujita circa 1945\u20136. Imagire arrived in 1947 and was given an address where Alexander had left her printed materials. He found the only building still standing after the bombing held 200 copies of \"Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and the New Era\" in Japanese. In 1948 Imagire helped re-elect the assembly in Tokyo. While all the Japanese members were new Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds and eventually drifted into inactivity, the assembly was continually re-elected and remains today.\nAlexander was able to return to Japan in 1950 after being sponsored by Lt. J.C. Davenport (USAF) and in 1951 four American pioneers were elected to the Tokyo Local Spiritual Assembly. The Japanese membership then was Miss Ichige, Mr. Kadota, Mr. Horioka, Miss Nakanishi, and Mr. Yoshino. The Americans were Alexander, Lane Skelton, Barbara Davenport, and Imagire. The assembly designated goal areas to take the religion \u2014 Yokohama, Sendai, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Kofu \u2014 and established eight committees with attention ranging from re-translating \"Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and the New Era\" to coordinating membership record keeping and the arrival of Persian pioneers. The Moghbel and Katirai Persian families arrived in 1953. In 1954 the community was 52 adults \u2014 10 were Americans and 13 were Persians. Barbara Sims, one of the American pioneers, was elected to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tokyo in 1954 and served for many years on that body and authored several books on the history of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Japan.\nThe first center owned by the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed assemblies in Japan was in &lt;a href=\"Amagasaki\"&gt;Amagasaki&lt;/a&gt; in 1953. The Tokyo assembly bought a house; it became the second Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Center in 1954. The third one was in &lt;a href=\"Osaka\"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt;. In 1956 there were eight assemblies in Japan and the community had marshaled resources to publish a Japanese language Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed \"Geppo\" (monthly newspaper) which was also read in Korea. In 1957 Sims was elected to the first regional National Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia, and Alexander was appointed as one of the &lt;a href=\"Hands%20of%20the%20Cause\"&gt;Hands of the Cause&lt;/a&gt;, a position which she held the rest of her lifetime.\nPost-War growth.\nIn 1963 the statistics of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed communities showed 13 assemblies, 9 groups of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, and 31 isolated Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds.\nToshio Suzuki became a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed near 1963 and would later serve on the National Spiritual Assembly of Japan and his brother, Hideya Suzuki, serve as the first Japanese Continental Counselor. In 1965 Alexander fell and broke her hip. She convalesced in Japan for two years and returned to Hawaii where she died in 1971. The first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Cemetery \u2014 a division of a larger cemetery \u2014 was established in 1958. The first burial there was in 1964 and represented a departure from socio-Buddhist norm of cremation. In 1968 Masaaki Ushibata traveled outside Japan for Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed purposes and in 1975 became the first Japanese pioneer \u2014 to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Caroline%20Islands\"&gt;Eastern Caroline Islands&lt;/a&gt;. In 1969 the Japanese Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds arrange for the first National Youth Conference in &lt;a href=\"Jogashima\"&gt;Jogashima&lt;/a&gt;. In 1971 the first residents of Okinawa converted to the religion. There were some marriages between Japanese Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds and other nationalities which sometimes faced racism in Japanese society.\nAmerican pioneers continued to play a role in Japan into the 1990s. In 1974 Sims was elected to the first National Spiritual Assembly of Japan, serving until 1993. Sims also had contact with &lt;a href=\"Ainu%20people\"&gt;Ainu&lt;/a&gt; Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds including notably chief &lt;a href=\"Takeichi%20Moritake\"&gt;Takeichi Moritake&lt;/a&gt; (1902\u20131976) and son Kazutomo Umegae (1924\u20131992).\nModern community.\nSince its inception, the religion has had involvement in &lt;a href=\"Socio-economic%20development%20%28Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%29\"&gt;socio-economic development&lt;/a&gt; beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the &lt;a href=\"Universal%20House%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Universal House of Justice&lt;/a&gt; dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20teachings\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings&lt;/a&gt;, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. The highest concentration of members can be found in Tokyo, where the \"Baha'i gatherings are often multi-ethnic and internationally minded,with primary activities consisting of study groups on the faith and discussions of local and global issues.\"\nWorldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The modern Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community of Japan has grown and developed strength in diverse interests.
