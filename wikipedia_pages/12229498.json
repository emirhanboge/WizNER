    "text": "Peter Maughan (May 7, 1811 \u2013 April 24, 1871) was an early &lt;a href=\"pioneer%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-Day%20Saints\"&gt;pioneer of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints&lt;/a&gt; who settled the &lt;a href=\"Cache%20Valley\"&gt;Cache Valley&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Utah\"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Brigham%20Young\"&gt;Brigham Young&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nMaughan was the sixth child of William Maughan and Martha Wilson and was born at Milton, &lt;a href=\"Cumberland\"&gt;Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;, England. As a youth, he worked in the lead mines at &lt;a href=\"Alston%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Alston, England&lt;/a&gt;. He married Ruth Harrison on October 1, 1831 and six children were born to them.\nPeter and Ruth were baptized members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Christ%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29\"&gt;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&lt;/a&gt; in Alston in 1838 and were active in the &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28LDS%20Church%29%23Branch\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt;. Ruth died on March 26, 1841, shortly after the birth of their sixth child. Following the counsel of &lt;a href=\"Brigham%20Young\"&gt;Brigham Young&lt;/a&gt;, who was on a &lt;a href=\"Mormon%20missionary\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; in England, Maughan and his children set sail on the \"Rochester\" for America, arriving May 19, 1841. Sailing with them were seven of the nine &lt;a href=\"Apostle%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29\"&gt;apostles&lt;/a&gt; who had been serving in England. The trip also was a sad occasion for Maughan, as he had to bury his baby daughter, Ruth, at sea.\nMaughan and his family went to &lt;a href=\"Kirtland%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Kirtland, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; for a few weeks where he met a young widow, Mary Ann Weston Davis. When he decided to travel to &lt;a href=\"Nauvoo%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Nauvoo, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, Mrs. Davis and her companion were in the same wagon train which allowed them to become more acquainted. After arriving in Nauvoo, they decided they would be married on November 2, 1841. To them were born eight children.\nIn Nauvoo, Maughan found work as a stonemason on the &lt;a href=\"Nauvoo%20Temple\"&gt;Nauvoo Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The family lived in Nauvoo for about two and a half years before Maughan was sent to &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Island%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Rock Island, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; to mine coal for the families in Nauvoo. When trouble developed in Nauvoo and the Saints were abandoning the city, the family was told to close up the mines in Rock Island and prepare to travel to the West.\nThe family moved to &lt;a href=\"New%20Diggings%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;New Diggings, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; in April 1846 where Maughan and the two older sons worked in the lead mines. Money was very scarce and the expense of living with such a large family and outfitting the two wagons needed caused the family to stay in New Diggings until April 1850. After finding lead ore on their own property, they were able to raise the final $800 in 8 weeks and buy the needed equipment and supplies for the long trip to the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20Valley\"&gt;Salt Lake Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey arrived in &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20City\"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt; on September 15, 1850, and after resting a week, they were sent to &lt;a href=\"Tooele%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Tooele&lt;/a&gt;. Challenges and discouragement filled the next five years. Poor soil, along with lack of water, plagues of grasshoppers, and Indian problems made survival difficult. During this time, Maughan was involved in the government as county clerk and assessor.\nIn the July 1856, &lt;a href=\"Brigham%20Young\"&gt;Brigham Young&lt;/a&gt; directed Maughan to lead a party of men from &lt;a href=\"Tooele%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Tooele&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Cache%20Valley\"&gt;Cache Valley&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of locating a permanent settlement. After surveying the area, the decision was made to settle the valley, and Maughan was chosen to lead the group. They arrived at what is now called &lt;a href=\"Wellsville%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Wellsville&lt;/a&gt; on the September 15, 1856 and began the development first called Maughan's Fort. The settlement of Wellsville was soon enlarged, and other communities in the area were founded. Maughan was called as presiding &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cache%20Valley\"&gt;Cache Valley&lt;/a&gt;, overseeing the &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28LDS%20Church%29\"&gt;wards&lt;/a&gt; and branches of the valley. In 1860, following directions from Brigham Young, he moved his family to &lt;a href=\"Logan%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Logan&lt;/a&gt;. He served as &lt;a href=\"Stake%20president\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; of the Cache Valley &lt;a href=\"Stake%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29\"&gt;Stake&lt;/a&gt;, as probate judge of &lt;a href=\"Cache%20County\"&gt;Cache County&lt;/a&gt;, and as a member of the territorial legislature. He also held the rank of colonel in the &lt;a href=\"Nauvoo%20Legion\"&gt;Nauvoo Legion&lt;/a&gt; in Utah.\nFor a time Maughan served as the regional presiding bishop in Cache County.\nMaughan took a third wife, Elizabeth Francis Preator, in the &lt;a href=\"Endowment%20House\"&gt;Endowment House&lt;/a&gt; on December 8, 1866. Peter and Elizabeth had three children: Frances Mary, Heber Chase, and Ada Lucille. Peter contracted pneumonia and died on April 24, 1871 at 60 years old. His body was buried in the Logan cemetery."
