    "text": "Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia (6 February 1729 \u2013 19 December 1814) was an Italian architect.\nBiography.\nMarvuglia received his first training in his native &lt;a href=\"Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt;. This was followed by a stay in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; from 1747 to 1759. By the end of his time there, a handful of progressive young architects and designers in the circuit of the French Academy in Rome were moving away from the ornate &lt;a href=\"Baroque\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; towards a simpler, more classical form of architecture under the influence of the antiquarian and architect &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Joachim%20Winckelmann\"&gt;Winckelmann&lt;/a&gt;, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Albani\"&gt;Alessandro Albani&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarvuglia's design of a town square won the second prize in a contest organised by the &lt;a href=\"Accademia%20San%20Luca\"&gt;Accademia San Luca&lt;/a&gt;. His entry had, at its centre, a circular domed building reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon%2C%20Rome\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; in Rome, but with Baroque features in its columns and statuary.\nFollowing his return to Sicily, he worked on the rebuilding of the monastery of San Martino delle Scale, in the mountains near Palermo; however, while Marvuglia's basic design was Baroque in style, the straight clean lines in the plan, as opposed to the curved facades and broken rooflines of typical &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Baroque\"&gt;Sicilian Baroque&lt;/a&gt;, are evidence that the tide of fashion was flowing towards &lt;a href=\"Neoclassicism\"&gt;Neoclassicism&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough much of Marvuglia's work was in municipal architecture, two churches are credited to him. One, at the very start of his independent career, is \"San Filippo Neri\" (1769), rather than in high Baroque, it is built with a &lt;a href=\"facade\"&gt;facade&lt;/a&gt; divided into three square divisions decorated with panels of bas-relief. The &lt;a href=\"pilaster\"&gt;pilaster&lt;/a&gt;s are flat and plain. The pediments are unbroken. The interior of the church has a gilded &lt;a href=\"barrel%20vault\"&gt;barrel vault&lt;/a&gt;ed ceiling, supported by great &lt;a href=\"marble\"&gt;marble&lt;/a&gt; columns. What is unusual in the Sicilian Baroque tradition here is that the columns do not support an &lt;a href=\"arcade%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt;, but a flat &lt;a href=\"entablature\"&gt;entablature&lt;/a&gt;. This church, which 18th-century English visitors much preferred to the ornate Sicilian Baroque, clearly shows the emerging migration from Baroque decoration towards a more sober order.\nIn his design for the church of San Francesco di Sales, located in Corso Calatafimi of Palermo (1772\u201376, consecrated 8 May 1818), Marvuglia interpreted a classicizing Palladian program of paired pilasters in the piers of an abbreviated arcade giving onto two pairs of side chapels, supporting an uninterrupted cornice carried entirely round the space, integrating the sober pedimented tabernacle of the high altar, all in a restrained tonality of white and cream that to an early viewer was \"semplice e senza ornamenti\" (\"simple and without ornaments\") as indeed it was in the context of Late Baroque Palermo.\nAs an architect, Marvuglia showed great understanding of proportion and mass. His Palazzo Constantino, a project he took over in 1787, shows a fusion of both the Neoclassical and &lt;a href=\"Palladian\"&gt;Palladian&lt;/a&gt;. He had the palace decorated by &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Velasquez\"&gt;Giuseppe Velasquez&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"Palazzo%20Riso\"&gt;Palazzo Belmonte Riso&lt;/a&gt; (completed in 1784) clearly shows better than any other in Sicily the final days of Sicilian Baroque as it was transformed into Neoclassicism; the unbroken skyline and the plain almost severe pillars and unbroken window pediments, far outweigh the Baroque sentiments in internal arcaded courtyard.\nMarvuglia designed two &lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt;s at the newly fashionable aristocratic enclave of &lt;a href=\"Bagheria\"&gt;Bagheria&lt;/a&gt;. The Villa Villarosa, while neoclassical in spirit is clearly influenced by the h\u00f4tels by Gabriel on the &lt;a href=\"Place%20de%20la%20Concorde\"&gt;Place Louis XV&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. For &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20I%20of%20Naples\"&gt;Ferdinand I of Naples&lt;/a&gt;, forced into temporary residence in Sicily by the republican revolution and the Napoleonic occupation, he designed a whimsical \"&lt;a href=\"Casina%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;Casina&lt;/a&gt; Cinese\" in the royal park of La Favorita outside Palermo and at Ficuzza a long unbroken block of a severely classical villa with very little relief and an unbroken cornice.\nAs a teacher of architecture Marvuglia strongly supported the study of Sicily's Greek temples, however, in spite of his later reputation as a Neoclassical architect he never applied to his own work the strict rules and proportions he found in his studies of ancient Greek architecture.\nHe died in Palermo in 1814."
