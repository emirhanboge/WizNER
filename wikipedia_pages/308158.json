    "title": "Vacuum energy",
    "text": "Vacuum energy is an underlying background &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; that exists in &lt;a href=\"space\"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; throughout the entire &lt;a href=\"Universe\"&gt;Universe&lt;/a&gt;. The vacuum energy is a special case of &lt;a href=\"zero-point%20energy\"&gt;zero-point energy&lt;/a&gt; that relates to the &lt;a href=\"quantum%20vacuum\"&gt;quantum vacuum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe effects of vacuum energy can be experimentally observed in various phenomena such as &lt;a href=\"spontaneous%20emission\"&gt;spontaneous emission&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Casimir%20effect\"&gt;Casimir effect&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lamb%20shift\"&gt;Lamb shift&lt;/a&gt;, and are thought to influence the behavior of the Universe on &lt;a href=\"Physical%20cosmology\"&gt;cosmological scales&lt;/a&gt;. Using the upper limit of the &lt;a href=\"cosmological%20constant\"&gt;cosmological constant&lt;/a&gt;, the vacuum energy of free space has been estimated to be 10\u22129 &lt;a href=\"joule\"&gt;joule&lt;/a&gt;s (10\u22122 &lt;a href=\"erg\"&gt;erg&lt;/a&gt;s), or ~5 GeV per cubic meter. However, in &lt;a href=\"quantum%20electrodynamics\"&gt;quantum electrodynamics&lt;/a&gt;, consistency with the principle of &lt;a href=\"Lorentz%20covariance\"&gt;Lorentz covariance&lt;/a&gt; and with the magnitude of the &lt;a href=\"Planck%20constant\"&gt;Planck constant&lt;/a&gt; suggest a much larger value of 10113 joules per cubic meter. This huge discrepancy is known as the &lt;a href=\"cosmological%20constant%20problem\"&gt;cosmological constant problem&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin.\n&lt;a href=\"Quantum%20field%20theory\"&gt;Quantum field theory&lt;/a&gt; states that all fundamental &lt;a href=\"field%20%28physics%29\"&gt;fields&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"electromagnetic%20field\"&gt;electromagnetic field&lt;/a&gt;, must be &lt;a href=\"Quantization%20%28physics%29\"&gt;quantized&lt;/a&gt; at each and every point in space. A field in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field is like the displacement of a ball from its rest position. The theory requires \"vibrations\" in, or more accurately changes in the strength of, such a field to propagate as per the appropriate &lt;a href=\"wave%20equation\"&gt;wave equation&lt;/a&gt; for the particular field in question. The &lt;a href=\"second%20quantization\"&gt;second quantization&lt;/a&gt; of quantum field theory requires that each such ball\u2013spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. Canonically, if the field at each point in space is a &lt;a href=\"Harmonic%20oscillator\"&gt;simple harmonic oscillator&lt;/a&gt;, its quantization places a &lt;a href=\"quantum%20harmonic%20oscillator\"&gt;quantum harmonic oscillator&lt;/a&gt; at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the &lt;a href=\"elementary%20particle\"&gt;elementary particle&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"particle%20physics\"&gt;particle physics&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, according to the theory, even the &lt;a href=\"vacuum\"&gt;vacuum&lt;/a&gt; has a vastly complex structure and all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.\nThe theory considers vacuum to implicitly have the same properties as a particle, such as &lt;a href=\"spin%20%28physics%29\"&gt;spin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Polarization%20%28waves%29\"&gt;polarization&lt;/a&gt; in the case of &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, energy, and so on. According to the theory, most of these properties cancel out on average leaving the vacuum empty in the literal sense of the word. One important exception, however, is the vacuum energy or the &lt;a href=\"vacuum%20expectation%20value\"&gt;vacuum expectation value&lt;/a&gt; of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator requires the lowest possible energy, or &lt;a href=\"zero-point%20energy\"&gt;zero-point energy&lt;/a&gt; of such an oscillator to be\nSumming over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. To remove this infinity, one may argue that only differences in energy are physically measurable, much as the concept of &lt;a href=\"potential%20energy\"&gt;potential energy&lt;/a&gt; has been treated in &lt;a href=\"classical%20mechanics\"&gt;classical mechanics&lt;/a&gt; for centuries. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of &lt;a href=\"renormalization\"&gt;renormalization&lt;/a&gt;. In all practical calculations, this is how the infinity is handled.\nVacuum energy can also be thought of in terms of &lt;a href=\"virtual%20particles\"&gt;virtual particles&lt;/a&gt; (also known as vacuum fluctuations) which are created and destroyed out of the vacuum. These particles are always created out of the vacuum in particle\u2013&lt;a href=\"antiparticle\"&gt;antiparticle&lt;/a&gt; pairs, which in most cases shortly annihilate each other and disappear. However, these particles and antiparticles may interact with others before disappearing, a process which can be mapped using &lt;a href=\"Feynman%20diagrams\"&gt;Feynman diagrams&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this method of computing vacuum energy is mathematically equivalent to having a &lt;a href=\"quantum%20harmonic%20oscillator\"&gt;quantum harmonic oscillator&lt;/a&gt; at each point and, therefore, suffers the same renormalization problems.\nAdditional contributions to the vacuum energy come from &lt;a href=\"spontaneous%20symmetry%20breaking\"&gt;spontaneous symmetry breaking&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"quantum%20field%20theory\"&gt;quantum field theory&lt;/a&gt;.\nImplications.\nVacuum energy has a number of consequences. In 1948, &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"physicist\"&gt;physicist&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Hendrik%20Casimir\"&gt;Hendrik B. G. Casimir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dirk%20Polder\"&gt;Dirk Polder&lt;/a&gt; predicted the existence of a tiny attractive force between closely placed metal plates due to &lt;a href=\"resonance\"&gt;resonance&lt;/a&gt;s in the vacuum energy in the space between them. This is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Casimir%20effect\"&gt;Casimir effect&lt;/a&gt; and has since been extensively experimentally verified. It is therefore believed that the vacuum energy is \"real\" in the same sense that more familiar conceptual objects such as electrons, magnetic fields, etc., are real. However, alternative explanations for the Casimir effect have since been proposed.\nOther predictions are harder to verify. Vacuum fluctuations are always created as particle\u2013antiparticle pairs. The creation of these virtual particles near the &lt;a href=\"event%20horizon\"&gt;event horizon&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"black%20hole\"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt; has been hypothesized by physicist &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Hawking\"&gt;Stephen Hawking&lt;/a&gt; to be a mechanism for the eventual &lt;a href=\"Hawking%20radiation\"&gt;\"evaporation\" of black holes&lt;/a&gt;. If one of the pair is pulled into the black hole before this, then the other particle becomes \"real\" and energy/mass is essentially radiated into space from the black hole. This loss is cumulative and could result in the black hole's disappearance over time. The time required is dependent on the mass of the black hole (the equations indicate that the smaller the black hole, the more rapidly it evaporates) but could be on the order of &lt;a href=\"Googol\"&gt;10100&lt;/a&gt; years for large solar-mass black holes.\nThe vacuum energy also has important consequences for &lt;a href=\"physical%20cosmology\"&gt;physical cosmology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"General%20relativity\"&gt;General relativity&lt;/a&gt; predicts that energy is equivalent to mass, and therefore, if the vacuum energy is \"really there\", it should exert a &lt;a href=\"gravity\"&gt;gravitational&lt;/a&gt; force. Essentially, a non-zero vacuum energy is expected to contribute to the &lt;a href=\"cosmological%20constant\"&gt;cosmological constant&lt;/a&gt;, which affects the &lt;a href=\"expansion%20of%20the%20universe\"&gt;expansion of the universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe existence of vacuum energy is also sometimes used as theoretical justification for the possibility of free-energy machines. It has been argued that due to the broken symmetry (in QED), free energy does not violate conservation of energy, since the laws of thermodynamics only apply to equilibrium systems. However, consensus amongst physicists is that this is unknown as the nature of vacuum energy remains an unsolved problem.\nHistory.\nIn 1934, &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Lema%C3%AEtre\"&gt;Georges Lema\u00eetre&lt;/a&gt; used an unusual &lt;a href=\"ideal%20gas\"&gt;perfect-fluid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"equation%20of%20state\"&gt;equation of state&lt;/a&gt; to interpret the cosmological constant as due to vacuum energy. In 1948, the &lt;a href=\"Casimir%20effect\"&gt;Casimir effect&lt;/a&gt; provided an experimental method for a verification of the existence of vacuum energy; in 1955, however, &lt;a href=\"Evgeny%20Lifshitz\"&gt;Evgeny Lifshitz&lt;/a&gt; offered a different origin for the Casimir effect. In 1957, &lt;a href=\"Tsung-Dao%20Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Ning%20Yang\"&gt;Yang&lt;/a&gt; proved the concepts of broken symmetry and &lt;a href=\"parity%20violation\"&gt;parity violation&lt;/a&gt;, for which they won the Nobel prize. In 1973, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Tryon\"&gt;Edward Tryon&lt;/a&gt; proposed the &lt;a href=\"zero-energy%20universe\"&gt;zero-energy universe&lt;/a&gt; hypothesis: that the Universe may be a large-scale quantum-mechanical vacuum fluctuation where positive &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;\u2013energy is balanced by negative gravitational &lt;a href=\"potential%20energy\"&gt;potential energy&lt;/a&gt;. During the 1980s, there were many attempts to relate the fields that generate the vacuum energy to specific fields that were predicted by attempts at a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20unification%20theory\"&gt;Grand unification theory&lt;/a&gt; and to use observations of the Universe to confirm one or another version. However, the exact nature of the particles (or fields) that generate vacuum energy, with a density such as that required by inflation theory, remains a mystery."
