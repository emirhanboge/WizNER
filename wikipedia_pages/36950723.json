According to Kelly they were \"just kicking ideas around and we wanted to have a romantic song but an underlying message of what she is about. Obviously, she is married to &lt;a href=\"Grant%20Hill\"&gt;Grant Hill&lt;/a&gt; and they both have working schedules. And we said\u2026 'Let\u2019s celebrate the marriage and what it\u2019s like to come off the road and surprise you. Let\u2019s do \u2018Beautiful Surprise.'\u201d The song was finished in about 45 minutes.\nCritical reception.\nIn his review for the same-titled parent album, Jon Caramanica found that \"Beautiful Surprise\" was out of several tracks on the album that nod \"at the dance floor while never really stepping onto it. Of these, the title track [...] hits hardest, juxtaposing restrained boom-bap against Tamia\u2019s pretty fluttering.\" Mark Edward Nero from &lt;a href=\"About.com\"&gt;About.com&lt;/a&gt; remarked that the song was \"a prime example of how underrated her vocal strength is.\" It had Tamia singing \"sweetly\" over \"a moderately uptempo beat.\" Richard Spadine, writing for \"DJBooth\", felt that the \"track finds Salaam Remi serving up a smooth synth beat as Tamia expresses her joy at finding herself in the arms of the man she loves upon waking up in the morning.\" He called it \"one of many quality tunes to be found on the singer's fifth studio album.\" &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; cited \"Beautiful Surprise\" as \"one of the album's shortcomings,\" calling it \"lukewarm.\"\nMusic video.\n The accompanying music video for \"Beautiful Surprise\" was directed by Canadian filmmaker &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Pallotta\"&gt;Ryan Pallotta&lt;/a&gt;.
