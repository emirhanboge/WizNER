    "text": "Mark McKeever (born 16 November 1978) is a former professional and semi-professional &lt;a href=\"association%20footballer\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player who last played for &lt;a href=\"Conference%20South\"&gt;Conference South&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Weston-super-Mare%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Weston-super-Mare&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nMcKeever began his football career with &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Norwich City&lt;/a&gt; as a youth team player. He was eventually released and moved on to &lt;a href=\"Peterborough%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Peterborough United&lt;/a&gt; with ex-Canaries coach Kit Carson. McKeever became a trainee with the club, but after only three appearances he was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in April 1997 with &lt;a href=\"David%20Billington%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;David Billington&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a31,000,000.\nMcKeever made three appearances in the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; and was looking to break into the first team before a foot injury prematurely ended his season. He was subsequently sent on loan to &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol Rovers&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Reading%20F.C.\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt;. During his stint with the Royals he played in a 4\u20130 away victory over &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Stoke City&lt;/a&gt;. However, over the following weeks, Stoke full-back &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Kavanagh\"&gt;Jason Kavanagh&lt;/a&gt; made a full catalogue of &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20One\"&gt;Division Two&lt;/a&gt; wingers look like Best at his peak.\nMcKeever made his sixth appearance for Wednesday in an &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; tie against &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1999-00%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;December 1999&lt;/a&gt;. A year later, McKeever was linked with a return to Bristol Rovers after they had supposedly tabled a \u00a3100,000 bid for him. But the permanent move did not materialise.\nMcKeever moved to Bristol Rovers on loan for two months in 2001. In March 2001, the move was made permanent, with McKeever moving south on a free transfer. He spent two years with Rovers before being released in &lt;a href=\"2002-03%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;May 2003&lt;/a&gt;. He then joined &lt;a href=\"Weston-super-Mare%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Weston-super-Mare&lt;/a&gt; in August 2003, for whom he played for a period of three years before signing for &lt;a href=\"Bath%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Bath City&lt;/a&gt; in May 2006. It was here that he won a Southern League winners medal in 2007.\nBath City sent McKeever on loan in January 2008 to &lt;a href=\"Mangotsfield%20United\"&gt;Mangotsfield United&lt;/a&gt;, but he was soon transferred to fellow &lt;a href=\"Conference%20South\"&gt;Conference South&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Weston-super-Mare%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Weston-super-Mare&lt;/a&gt; in March 2008 for his second stint with the club.\nOn 18 August 2009 he was forced to retire following injury.\nHe has been capped by the Republic of Ireland at Under-18 level (12 caps) and by their Under-21s (4 caps). McKeever played for the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20under-19%20football%20team\"&gt;Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1997%20UEFA%20European%20Under-18%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;1997 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship&lt;/a&gt; finals in Iceland."
