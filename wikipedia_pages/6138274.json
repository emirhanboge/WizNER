    "text": "The western spinebill (\"Acanthorhynchus superciliosus\") is a &lt;a href=\"honeyeater\"&gt;honeyeater&lt;/a&gt; found in the &lt;a href=\"Heath%20%28habitat%29\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"woodland\"&gt;woodland&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20Australia\"&gt;south-western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Ranging between long, it weighs around . It has a black head, gray back and wings, with a red band behind its neck and from its throat to its breast. Its curved bill is long and slender.\nLike other honeyeaters, the western spinebill feeds on nectar. It tends to obtain its nectar from lower shrubs than most other honeyeaters, including \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia\"&gt;Banksia&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Dryandra\"&gt;Dryandra&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grevillea\"&gt;Grevillea&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Adenanthos\"&gt;Adenanthos&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Verticordia\"&gt;Verticordia&lt;/a&gt;\". It also feeds from trees of \"Banksia\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Eucalyptus\"&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/a&gt;\", and from herbs such as \"&lt;a href=\"Anigozanthos\"&gt;Anigozanthos&lt;/a&gt;\". In addition to nectar, it feeds on insects that it captures in the air or on plants.\nIt is a frequent visitor to \"&lt;a href=\"Adenanthos%20obovatus\"&gt;Adenanthos obovatus&lt;/a&gt;\", and its territories are smaller when they contain more shrubs of this species. Male spinebills often contest their territory borders with other males, and allow females to live within them. These territories range from 0.2 to 0.5 hectares in size. With their long curved bills, western spinebills are the only honeyeaters able to gain nectar out of the tube-like flowers.\nIt breeds from September to January, in a nest made from bark, plant stems, down and spider web. It lays 1\u20132\u00a0eggs, usually incubated by the female.\nSystematics.\nFirst described by &lt;a href=\"John%20Gould\"&gt;John Gould&lt;/a&gt; in 1837, the western spinebill is a &lt;a href=\"monotypic\"&gt;monotypic&lt;/a&gt; species, with only one form found across its range. It forms a &lt;a href=\"superspecies\"&gt;superspecies&lt;/a&gt; with the closely related &lt;a href=\"eastern%20spinebill\"&gt;eastern spinebill&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists believe the two &lt;a href=\"sister%20species\"&gt;sister species&lt;/a&gt; are descended from a shared ancestor whose once widespread populations were separated by &lt;a href=\"climate%20variability\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;. During a past period of &lt;a href=\"desertification\"&gt;desertification&lt;/a&gt;, that ancestor species retreated to &lt;a href=\"refugium%20%28population%20biology%29\"&gt;refuges&lt;/a&gt; in the southwestern and southeastern corners of the continent, and &lt;a href=\"evolution\"&gt;evolved&lt;/a&gt; into the two present-day spinebill species. Recent &lt;a href=\"DNA\"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; studies have shown that the two spinebills belong to a &lt;a href=\"clade\"&gt;clade&lt;/a&gt; which is a &lt;a href=\"sister%20taxon\"&gt;sister taxon&lt;/a&gt; to all other honeyeaters.\nThe two are members of the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Acanthorhynchus\"&gt;Acanthorhynchus&lt;/a&gt;\", from the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; \"akantha\", meaning 'spine' and \"rhunkhos\", meaning 'bill'. The &lt;a href=\"specific%20name%20%28zoology%29\"&gt;specific name&lt;/a&gt; \"superciliosus\" is &lt;a href=\"Latin%20language\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; for 'eyebrowed', a reference to the male's bold white supercilium. Early settler &lt;a href=\"George%20Fletcher%20Moore\"&gt;George Fletcher Moore&lt;/a&gt; reported that the &lt;a href=\"Noongar\"&gt;Noongar&lt;/a&gt;, southwestern Australia's &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;indigenous people&lt;/a&gt;, called this species \"buljit\".\nDescription.\nThe western spinebill is a small honeyeater with a slender, curved &lt;a href=\"beak\"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt;. It ranges in length from , and in weight from . Males are, on average, slightly larger than females. The sexes differ somewhat in plumage. The male is dark olive-grey above with a chestnut nape. Below, his throat and breast are chestnut, edged below with a white band and a black band; his abdomen is buff. He has a white &lt;a href=\"supercilium\"&gt;eyebrow&lt;/a&gt; and a black mask, and white outer tail feathers which are '&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aflirt\"&gt;flirted&lt;/a&gt;' in flight. The female is plainer, with a pale rufous nape. Her throat and underparts are variously described as rufous-buff or pale grey, and she lacks the distinctive banding of the male. The immature resembles a plainer female, though with a yellow base to the bill.\nVoice.\nThe high, shrill, staccato piping of the western spinebill is transcribed as ' or '.\nRange and habitat.\n&lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;Endemic&lt;/a&gt; to the southwestern corner of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the western spinebill is found from north of &lt;a href=\"Jurien%20Bay\"&gt;Jurien Bay&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Israelite%20Bay\"&gt;Israelite Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and inland to an arc described by &lt;a href=\"Moora\"&gt;Moora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corrigin\"&gt;Corrigin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Grace\"&gt;Lake Grace&lt;/a&gt;. It is common in the &lt;a href=\"understorey\"&gt;understorey&lt;/a&gt; of heaths, coastal scrub, woodlands and forest, and in \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia\"&gt;Banksia&lt;/a&gt;\" thickets.\nThe species is kept in Western Australian aviaries, as the sister species \"&lt;a href=\"Acanthorhynchus%20tenuirostris\"&gt;Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris&lt;/a&gt;\" of the east is held in captivity in Sydney, due to the local species being available to avicultural enthusiasts of honeyeaters.\nBehaviour.\nThe western spinebill is known to be locally nomadic.\nFeeding.\nLike other honeyeaters, the western spinebill feeds primarily on &lt;a href=\"nectar\"&gt;nectar&lt;/a&gt;. It feeds for longer time periods\u2014and ingests more nectar\u2014in the first 60 to 90 minutes of each day than it does later in the day.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Banksia%20ilicifolia\"&gt;Banksia ilicifolia&lt;/a&gt;\" is particularly sought over other banksias, which may be foraged, including \"B. menziesii\" (although birds do not congregate in greater numbers when this species is flowering), and \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia%20sessilis\"&gt;B. sessilis&lt;/a&gt;\". The western spinebill has been observed foraging at flower spikes lower down in the tree canopy, possibly to avoid larger and more aggressive honeyeaters.\nBreeding.\nThe western spinebill breeds primarily from September to January, though eggs have been noted as early as August, and fledglings as late as March. The female, only very occasionally with help from the male, builds a tidy &lt;a href=\"bird%20nest\"&gt;cup nest&lt;/a&gt; from bark, grass, plant stems, and plant down, bound with &lt;a href=\"spider%20web\"&gt;spider web&lt;/a&gt;s to a low bush or tree. The nest, which is sometimes conspicuous, is typically located off the ground. The female lays 1\u20132\u00a0&lt;a href=\"egg%20%28biology%29\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;, which measure on average. These are pinkish or bluish with spots and blotches of chestnut or purplish-brown. The eggs are &lt;a href=\"avian%20incubation\"&gt;incubated&lt;/a&gt; primarily by the female, only very occasionally by the male. &lt;a href=\"Nestling\"&gt;Nestling&lt;/a&gt;s are fed by both parents, and &lt;a href=\"fledge\"&gt;fledge&lt;/a&gt; after 15\u00a0days or so. Both parents continue to feed the fledglings for some time after they leave the nest. The species is one of many known to host the offspring of the &lt;a href=\"pallid%20cuckoo\"&gt;pallid cuckoo&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"brood%20parasite\"&gt;brood parasite&lt;/a&gt;."
