    "text": "Denmark\u2013Germany relations (; ) are the foreign relations between &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Both countries are full members of &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; and of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. The border between the countries, which lies in the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Schleswig\"&gt;Schleswig&lt;/a&gt; region, has changed several times through history, the present border was determined by &lt;a href=\"1920%20Schleswig%20plebiscites\"&gt;referendums in 1920&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Denmark%E2%80%93Germany%20border\"&gt;Danish-German border&lt;/a&gt; area has been named as a positive example for other border regions. Substantial minority populations live on both sides of the border, and cross-border cooperation activities are frequently initiated.\nHistory.\nSecond Schleswig War.\nThe Second Schleswig War was the second military conflict as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Schleswig-Holstein%20Question\"&gt;Schleswig-Holstein Question&lt;/a&gt;. It began on 1 February 1864, when Prussian forces crossed the border into Schleswig.\nDenmark fought &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;. Like the &lt;a href=\"First%20Schleswig%20War\"&gt;First Schleswig War&lt;/a&gt; (1848\u201351), it was fought for control of the duchies because of succession disputes concerning the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg when the Danish king died without an heir acceptable to the &lt;a href=\"German%20Confederation\"&gt;German Confederation&lt;/a&gt;. Decisive controversy arose due to the passing of the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein%23The%20November%20Constitution\"&gt;November Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, which brought the Duchy of Schleswig closer to the kingdom of Denmark in violation of the &lt;a href=\"London%20Protocol%20%281852%29\"&gt;London Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, after the German Confederation had rejected the previous state constitution (\"Helstatsforfatning\").\nThe war ended on 30 October 1864, when the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Vienna%20%281864%29\"&gt;Treaty of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; caused Denmark's cession of the Duchies of Schleswig, Holstein, and &lt;a href=\"Saxe-Lauenburg\"&gt;Saxe-Lauenburg&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;. The war resulted in a German victory.\nEnd of World War I.\nDenmark, despite having remained neutral all throughout &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, still ended up involved in the negotiations following the defeat of Germany, due to US President &lt;a href=\"Woodrow%20Wilson\"&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Fourteen%20Points\"&gt;Fourteen Points&lt;/a&gt; listing the different people of Europe's right to self-determination amongst its principles, and the substantial Danish minority living in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Jutland\"&gt;Southern Jutland&lt;/a&gt;/Northern Schleswig area. Eventually, it was decided that the question of national affiliation for the people living in the area would be settled through a democratic election.\nIn accordance with negotiations, the Southern Jutland/Northern Schleswig area was split into three different zones. After an agreement between the Danish government, who declared they had no real interest in the third, southernmost zone, and the British prime-minister &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%20George\"&gt;Lloyd George&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted to give Germany some minor concessions in the peace treaty, it was decided that no election was to take place there, while elections were to take place in the two other zones.\nThe elections could not be arranged until the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt; became effective in January 1920, but following that it was decided that elections were to take place in the first, northernmost zone on February 10, and the second, middle zone on March 14. In the outcome of the first zone election, about 75 percent of the votes favored a reunification with Denmark, while in the second zone about 80 percent of the votes were in favor of staying affiliated with Germany. Further negotiations between the Danish and the German governments settled on Denmark getting the area of &lt;a href=\"T%C3%B8nder\"&gt;T\u00f8nder&lt;/a&gt;, despite it formally being a part of the second zone, while the &lt;a href=\"Flensborg\"&gt;Flensborg&lt;/a&gt; area was to remain on German hands. On June 15 the Southern Jutland area was formally returned to Danish control.\nWorld War II.\nOperation Weser\u00fcbung was the code name for &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; and the opening operation of the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Campaign\"&gt;Norwegian Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. The name comes from the &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; for Operation Weser-Exercise, the &lt;a href=\"Weser%20River\"&gt;Weser&lt;/a&gt; being a German river.\nIn the early morning of 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway, ostensibly as a preventive maneuver against a planned, and openly discussed, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;Franco&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Military%20occupation\"&gt;occupation&lt;/a&gt; of both these countries. After the invasions, envoys of the Germans informed the governments of Denmark and Norway that the \"&lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt;\" had come to protect the countries' &lt;a href=\"Neutral%20country\"&gt;neutrality&lt;/a&gt; against Franco-British aggression. Significant differences in &lt;a href=\"geography\"&gt;geography&lt;/a&gt;, location and &lt;a href=\"climate\"&gt;climate&lt;/a&gt; between the two countries, however, made the actual military operations very dissimilar.\nStrategically, Denmark's importance to Germany was as a staging area for operations in Norway, and of course as a border nation to Germany which would have to be controlled in some way. Given Denmark's position in relation to the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; the country was also important for the control of naval and shipping access to major German and Soviet harbours.\nSmall and relatively flat, the country was ideal territory for German army operations, and Denmark's small army had little hope. Nevertheless, in the early morning hours, a few Danish troops engaged the German army, suffering losses of 16 dead and 20 wounded. The Germans lost an unknown number of casualties, with 12 &lt;a href=\"Armored%20car%20%28military%29\"&gt;armoured car&lt;/a&gt;s and several motorcycles and cars destroyed. Four German tanks were damaged. One German bomber was also damaged. Two German soldiers were temporarily captured by the Danes during the brief fighting.\nAt 04:00 on 9 April 1940, the German ambassador to Denmark, &lt;a href=\"Cecil%20von%20Renthe-Fink\"&gt;Renthe-Fink&lt;/a&gt;, called the Danish Foreign Minister &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Rochegune%20Munch\"&gt;Munch&lt;/a&gt; and requested a meeting with him. When the two men met 20 minutes later, Renthe-Fink declared that German troops were at that moment moving in to occupy Denmark to protect the country from Franco-British attack. The German ambassador demanded that Danish resistance cease immediately and contact be made between Danish authorities and the German armed forces. If the demands were not met, the Luftwaffe would bomb the capital, Copenhagen.\nAs the German demands were communicated, the first German advances had already been made, with forces landing by ferry in &lt;a href=\"Gedser\"&gt;Gedser&lt;/a&gt; at 04:15 and moving north. German Fallschirmj\u00e4ger units had made unopposed landings and taken two airfields at Aalborg, the &lt;a href=\"Storstr%C3%B8m%20Bridge\"&gt;Storstr\u00f8m Bridge&lt;/a&gt; as well as the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Masned%C3%B8\"&gt;Masned\u00f8&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt 04:20 local time, 1,000 German infantrymen landed in Copenhagen harbour from the minelayer \"Hansestadt Danzig\", quickly capturing the Danish garrison at &lt;a href=\"Kastellet%2C%20Copenhagen\"&gt;the Citadel&lt;/a&gt; without encountering resistance. From the harbour, the Germans moved towards &lt;a href=\"Amalienborg%20Palace\"&gt;Amalienborg Palace&lt;/a&gt; to capture the Danish royal family. By the time the invasion forces arrived at the king's residence, the &lt;a href=\"Den%20Kongelige%20Livgarde\"&gt;King's Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt; had been alerted and other reinforcements were on their way to the palace. The first German attack on Amalienborg was repulsed, giving &lt;a href=\"Christian%20X%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Christian X&lt;/a&gt; and his ministers time to confer with the Danish Army chief &lt;a href=\"William%20Wain%20Prior\"&gt;General Prior&lt;/a&gt;. As the discussions were ongoing, several formations of Heinkel He 111 and &lt;a href=\"Dornier%20Do%2017\"&gt;Dornier Do 17&lt;/a&gt; bombers roared over the city dropping the &lt;a href=\"OPROP%21\"&gt;OPROP!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pamphlet\"&gt;leaflets&lt;/a&gt;. Faced with the explicit threat of the &lt;a href=\"Luftwaffe\"&gt;Luftwaffe&lt;/a&gt; bombing the civilian population of Copenhagen, and only General Prior in favour of continuing to fight, King Christian X and the entire Danish government capitulated at 08:34 in exchange for retaining political independence in domestic matters.\nAt 05:45, two squadrons of German Bf 110s attacked &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A6rl%C3%B8se\"&gt;V\u00e6rl\u00f8se&lt;/a&gt; airfield on &lt;a href=\"Zealand%20%28Denmark%29\"&gt;Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and wiped out the Danish Army Air Service by &lt;a href=\"strafing\"&gt;strafing&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Danish &lt;a href=\"Anti-aircraft%20warfare\"&gt;anti-aircraft&lt;/a&gt; fire, the German fighters destroyed 11 Danish aircraft and seriously damaged another 14.\nThe invasion of Denmark lasted less than six hours and was the shortest military campaign conducted by the Germans during the war. The rapid Danish capitulation resulted in the uniquely lenient &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Occupation of Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, particularly until the summer of 1943, and in postponing the arrest and &lt;a href=\"deportation\"&gt;deportation&lt;/a&gt; of Danish &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;s until nearly all of them were &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20of%20the%20Danish%20Jews\"&gt;warned and on their way to refuge in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, 477 Danish Jews were deported, and 70 of them lost their lives, out of a pre-war total of Jews and half-Jews at a little over 8,000.\nContemporary.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and Denmark are members of the European Union and NATO. Denmark has an embassy in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a consulate general in &lt;a href=\"Flensburg\"&gt;Flensburg&lt;/a&gt; and one in &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;. Germany maintains an embassy in Copenhagen as well as a network of honorary consulates around Denmark. The &lt;a href=\"Bonn-Copenhagen%20declarations\"&gt;Bonn-Copenhagen declarations&lt;/a&gt; of 1955 establishes mutual recognition of the minorities on both side of the border, assures full civil rights and the right to establish schools teaching in the minority language. Additionally, the Danish Ministry of Education (Undervisningsministeret) cooperated with the Bundes state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's ministry of education, Kultusministerium, to develop and carry out an exchange programme between gymnasium students in both countries. The official name of the programme is \"Deutsch-D\u00e4nisches grenzen\u00fcbergreifendes Sch\u00fcleraustauschprogramm f\u00fcr die Entwicklung und den Beibehalt, essentieller kultureller Verst\u00e4ndigung und pr\u00e4genden Erfahrungen\". The first exchange was officially carried out in April 2016 in the city of Mosbach, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The second official exchange took place in Odense, Denmark, in May, followed by a third, but not final, successful visit in August 2016. Even though the programme is officially over, plans have been made for a comeback before the end of 2016.\nBorder control.\nIn the context of the &lt;a href=\"European%20migrant%20crisis\"&gt;European migrant crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Denmark has been maintaining temporary &lt;a href=\"border%20control\"&gt;border control&lt;/a&gt; on the Danish-German border since January 4, 2016, which has been repeatedly extended. As of April 2019, slightly more than 10 million people have been stopped, of which 7599 have been turned away. As of October 2018, 801 weapons have been confiscated and 5479 charges of, among other things, human trafficking and drug smuggling, have been brought. The police have been releasing &lt;a href=\"https%3A//politi.dk/statistik/graensekontrol\"&gt;weekly tallies&lt;/a&gt; of individuals checked, individuals denied entry and individuals charged with human trafficking."
