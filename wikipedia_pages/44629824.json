    "text": "The National Struggle Party (&lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;: \"Milli M\u00fccadele Partisi,\" abbreviated MMP) is a &lt;a href=\"Nationalism\"&gt;Nationalist&lt;/a&gt; political party in &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. It was formed by &lt;a href=\"Ahmet%20Kaya%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Ahmet Kaya&lt;/a&gt;, whose Turkish nationalism has been contrasted with the &lt;a href=\"Kurdish%20people\"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; nationalist &lt;a href=\"Ahmet%20Kaya\"&gt;singer&lt;/a&gt; of the same name. The MMP's founders claim that it is neither a rival nor an enemy of any other established party, even though its ideology is close to the &lt;a href=\"Nationalist%20Movement%20Party\"&gt;Nationalist Movement Party&lt;/a&gt; (MHP). The pro-&lt;a href=\"Justice%20and%20Development%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;Justice and Development Party&lt;/a&gt; (AKP) newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Yeni%20Akit\"&gt;Yeni Akit&lt;/a&gt;\" accused the party of being founded by supporters of &lt;a href=\"Fethullah%20G%C3%BClen\"&gt;Fethullah G\u00fclen&lt;/a&gt; after failing to gain influence within the MHP. However, the party also advocates &lt;a href=\"Kemalism\"&gt;Kemalism&lt;/a&gt;, which is in contrast with the &lt;a href=\"Islamist\"&gt;Islamist&lt;/a&gt; political agenda of G\u00fclen.\nThe party currently has no &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;representation&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20National%20Assembly\"&gt;Grand National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; and is yet to contest any elections."
