    "text": "\"(Ain't That) a Lot of Love\" is a 1966 song written by &lt;a href=\"Homer%20Banks\"&gt;Homer Banks&lt;/a&gt; and Willia Dean Parker, and first released by Banks on &lt;a href=\"Minit%20Records\"&gt;Minit Records&lt;/a&gt;, titled \"A Lot of Love\".\nSimply Red version.\nIn 1999, British &lt;a href=\"soul%20music\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Simply%20Red\"&gt;Simply Red&lt;/a&gt; made a cover of \"Ain't That a Lot of Love\". It was released as the first single from their seventh studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20and%20the%20Russian%20Winter\"&gt;Love and the Russian Winter&lt;/a&gt;\" and reached the Top 20 in Iceland, Scotland and the UK. On the &lt;a href=\"Eurochart%20Hot%20100\"&gt;Eurochart Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;, it peaked at number 28. Remixes by &lt;a href=\"Club%2069\"&gt;Club 69&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phats%20%26amp%3B%20Small\"&gt;Phats &amp; Small&lt;/a&gt; were released as bonus tracks on a 2008 Special Edition of the album. A black-and-white &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; was made for the song, directed by Mike Lipscombe. The same year, Welsh singer &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Jones%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Tom Jones&lt;/a&gt; covered the song with Simply Red on his 1999 duet album, \"&lt;a href=\"Reload%20%28Tom%20Jones%20album%29\"&gt;Reload&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCritical reception.\nJames Poletti from \"&lt;a href=\"Dotmusic\"&gt;Dotmusic&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that the song \"is a similarly &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;-influenced production\", like \"&lt;a href=\"Fairground%20%28song%29\"&gt;Fairground&lt;/a&gt;\". He added that it \"is indebted to the popular late 90s prototype laid down by &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20%28band%29\"&gt;Stardust&lt;/a&gt;'s '&lt;a href=\"Music%20Sounds%20Better%20with%20You\"&gt;Music Sounds Better with You&lt;/a&gt;'. The connection isn't as directly obvious this time but the song is built around that kind of groove.\" \"&lt;a href=\"Florida%20Today\"&gt;Florida Today&lt;/a&gt;\" said it \"conjures up a flash of magic\". John Terlesky from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Morning%20Call\"&gt;The Morning Call&lt;/a&gt; \"stated, \"Its rhythmic hooks and catchy chorus, tarted up with &lt;a href=\"techno\"&gt;techno&lt;/a&gt; trappings, stand out\" of the other songs of the &lt;a href=\"Love%20and%20the%20Russian%20Winter\"&gt;album&lt;/a&gt;."
