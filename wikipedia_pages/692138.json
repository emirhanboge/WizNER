    "text": "The chairman of the government of the Slovak Republic (), also known as the prime minister of Slovakia (), is the &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20government\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Slovakia\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovak Republic&lt;/a&gt;. On paper, the officeholder is the third highest constitutional official in Slovakia after the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Slovakia\"&gt;president of the republic&lt;/a&gt; (appointer) and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20speakers%20of%20Slovak%20parliaments\"&gt;speaker&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Council%20%28Slovakia%29\"&gt;National Council&lt;/a&gt;; in practice, the appointee is the country's leading political figure.\nSince the creation of the office in 1969, thirteen persons have served as head of government. Since 1993, when Slovakia gained independence, eight persons have occupied the function. On 1 April 2021, &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20Heger\"&gt;Eduard Heger&lt;/a&gt; became the prime minister of Slovakia.\nHistory.\nThe office of Prime Minister of Slovakia was established in 1969 by the &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20Act%20on%20the%20Czechoslovak%20Federation\"&gt;Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation&lt;/a&gt;. A similar office had existed from 1918 when various officials were presiding over executive bodies governing the Slovak part of &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Slovak%20Republic%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;Slovak State&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Since 1993, when the independent Slovak Republic was established, there have been six persons to hold the office. Since 2021, the prime minister of Slovakia has been &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20Heger\"&gt;Eduard Heger&lt;/a&gt;.\nPowers and role.\nSince Slovakia is a &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20republic\"&gt;parliamentary republic&lt;/a&gt; the prime minister is accountable to the National Council. The &lt;a href=\"Slovak%20Constitution\"&gt;Slovak Constitution&lt;/a&gt; provides that upon the accession to the office each prime minister must gain and thereafter maintain the confidence of the Parliament. As soon as the prime minister loses the confidence, the president is obliged to dismiss him and designate a new prime minister or entrust the dismissed prime minister to act as a caretaker with limited powers.\nThe prime minister is the most powerful office in state, since he commands and presides over the government. Although it is not the prime minister but the president who appoints ministers in Cabinet, the president appoints ministers on the advice of the prime minister.\nDesignated Prime Minister of Slovakia.\nDesignated Prime Minister of Slovakia () is an unofficial title for a person who has been entrusted by the &lt;a href=\"president%20of%20the%20Slovak%20Republic\"&gt;president of the Slovak Republic&lt;/a&gt; with forming a new government and replacing the outgoing prime minister. This title, as well as the authorization of the president to entrust the designated PM, is not set by an act but is a legal or, more precisely, constitutional tradition. According to this tradition, the president designates a person who has support of the majority of deputies in the National Council.\nList of prime ministers of Slovakia.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Czechoslovak%20Republic\"&gt;First Czechoslovak Republic&lt;/a&gt; (1918\u20131938).\nMinister plenipotentiary for administration of Slovakia\nLand President of Slovakia\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Czechoslovak%20Republic\"&gt;Second Czechoslovak Republic&lt;/a&gt; (1938\u20131939).\nPrime ministers of the Autonomy Government of Slovakia\n&lt;a href=\"Slovak%20Republic%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;First Slovak Republic&lt;/a&gt; (1939\u20131945).\nPrime ministers of the First Slovak Republic\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Czechoslovak%20Republic\"&gt;Third Czechoslovak Republic&lt;/a&gt; (1945\u20131948).\nChairman of the Board of Commissioners\n&lt;a href=\"Czechoslovak%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Czechoslovak Socialist Republic&lt;/a&gt; (1948\u20131989).\n\"1 January 1969 \u2013 5 March 1990: called \"Slovak Socialist Republic\" within &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nChairman of the Board of Commissioners\nChairman of the Slovak National Council\nPrime ministers of the &lt;a href=\"Slovak%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Slovak Socialist Republic&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Czech%20and%20Slovak%20Federative%20Republic\"&gt;Czech and Slovak Federative Republic&lt;/a&gt; (1990\u20131992).\n\"6 March 1990 \u2013 31 December 1992: called \"Slovak Republic\" within &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nPrime ministers of the Slovak Republic\n&lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovak Republic&lt;/a&gt; (1993\u2013present).\n\"From 1 January 1993 after the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;dissolution of Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;.\""
