In 2021, the team returned to the name of FC Buz\u0103u.\nIn spite of not holding the record of the old &lt;a href=\"FC%20Gloria%20Buz%C4%83u\"&gt;Gloria Buz\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;, local supporters consider it the main club of the city. Like its predecessor, FC Buz\u0103u plays its home matches on the 12,000-capacity &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Municipal%20%28Buz%C4%83u%29\"&gt;Municipal Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n\"FC Gloria Buz\u0103u (1973\u20132016)\".\n\"FC Gloria Buz\u0103u\", the original football club of the city, was founded on 16 June 1973, by the Buz\u0103u County Local Council, as part of CSM Buz\u0103u (\"Clubul Sportiv Municipal\") (&lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;En&lt;/a&gt;: \"Municipal Sports Club\"), the local all-sports association. Gloria absorbed the former team of &lt;a href=\"Buz%C4%83u\"&gt;Buz\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"AFC%20Metalul%20Buz%C4%83u\"&gt;Metalul&lt;/a&gt;\", whose place it also took in the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20III\"&gt;Divizia C&lt;/a&gt; (currently Liga III). With &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Metalul%20Buz%C4%83u\"&gt;Metalul&lt;/a&gt;'s players, together with other local footballers (especially from another team, \"\u0218oimii\"), they ranked 1st in their first season of Divizia C. Gloria won the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Divizia%20B\"&gt;Divizia B&lt;/a&gt; promotion play-off tournament and thus won promotion in their first year of existence.\nOn 26 May 2016, the Romanian Football Federation fined 14 players and three managers of FC Gloria for match-fixing in the Liga II, in 10 matches between September 2014 and May 2015 and imposed a total ban of 174 months on them. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20Liga%20II\"&gt;2015\u201316 Liga II&lt;/a&gt; season, Gloria had to face &lt;a href=\"FC%20Olimpia%20Satu%20Mare\"&gt;Olimpia Satu Mare&lt;/a&gt; in a relegation play-off in June but the club did not compete after it did not have enough players to line up once the bans had come into effect. Along with these developments the club went into bankruptcy after decades of ups and downs, in which the club spent only seven seasons in the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;top-flight&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n football, where it achieved as a \"best finish\" a 5th place.\nFirst years and ascent (2016\u2013present).\nAfter the bankruptcy of &lt;a href=\"FC%20Gloria%20Buz%C4%83u\"&gt;FC Gloria Buz\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;, businessman Ionel Turturic\u0103 founded a new club, FC Buz\u0103u, which was enrolled in the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20V\"&gt;Liga V&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Buz%C4%83u%20County\"&gt;Buz\u0103u County&lt;/a&gt;.
