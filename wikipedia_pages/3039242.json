Sensini played four seasons for the \"bianconeri\", before moving to &lt;a href=\"Parma%20F.C.\"&gt;Parma&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, where he remained for a further six seasons. During this period Sensini sometimes played in midfield and won two &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;s, two &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Italian Cup&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Super Cup&lt;/a&gt; with the \"gialloblu\", also reaching the final of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1994%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;.

Lazio&lt;/a&gt; starting from the &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1999\u20132000 season&lt;/a&gt;, winning the \"&lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;scudetto&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Italian Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"1999%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Super Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Supercoppa%20Italiana\"&gt;Supercoppa Italiana&lt;/a&gt; in his first season. After two years with the club, he moved back to &lt;a href=\"Parma%20F.C.\"&gt;Parma&lt;/a&gt; for a further year, winning another &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, before returning to his first Italian club, Udinese, in 2002.\nIn 2005, he was one of the most consistent performers in Udinese's surprise qualification for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;. Sensini was one of the oldest players of the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2005\u201306 Serie A&lt;/a&gt;, holding even the record as the oldest foreign player to score a goal in first division, at the age of 39 years, two months and 26 days. With over 380 matches at the top level, he was considered one of the most experienced defenders of the Italian league, and often nicknamed \"nonno\" (grandfather) by Italian sports journalists. He retired at the end of the season.\nInternational career.\n\"Boquita\" Sensini debuted for his &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;national team&lt;/a&gt; in 1987, and played his last match in 2000. He played in the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1990 FIFA World Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; Sensini conceded the disputed penalty kick from which &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt; scored their winning goal. He helped his country to a third-place finish at the &lt;a href=\"1989%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt;, and he was also part of the championship teams in the &lt;a href=\"1991%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1993%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;1993 Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt; tournaments, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;silver medal-winning team&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1996 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, as one of the three over-23 players allowed per squad.\nStyle of play.\nSensini was a consistent, decisive, and intelligent player. He was also extremely tactically versatile, and was capable of playing in any &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;defensive&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Midfielder\"&gt;midfield&lt;/a&gt; position. Throughout his career, he was deployed as a &lt;a href=\"full-back%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;full-back&lt;/a&gt;, an attacking &lt;a href=\"wing-back%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;wing-back&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"centre-back\"&gt;centre-back&lt;/a&gt;, or even as a &lt;a href=\"Central%20midfielder\"&gt;central&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"defensive%20midfielder\"&gt;defensive midfielder&lt;/a&gt;. Although he primarily excelled defensively as a ball winner, due to his marking and tackling ability, as well as his tough, aggressive, and physical playing style, he was also a player with good technique, who was capable of making attacking runs and contributing offensively for his team with occasional goals. Considered one of the best players of the 1990s and 2000s.\nManagement career.\nOn 10 February 2006, after the dismissal of &lt;a href=\"Serse%20Cosmi\"&gt;Serse Cosmi&lt;/a&gt;, Sensini ended his playing career and was appointed Udinese's new manager. He was supported in his new position by &lt;a href=\"Loris%20Dominissini\"&gt;Loris Dominissini&lt;/a&gt;, who was named co-coach. The following month when Dominissini was sacked, Sensini resigned and left the club. Results had not improved with the team in danger of &lt;a href=\"Promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;relegation&lt;/a&gt;, while they were defeated in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n team &lt;a href=\"PFC%20Levski%20Sofia\"&gt;Levski Sofia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the Argentine Torneo Clausura 2008, Sensini coached Estudiantes de La Plata, having replaced &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Simeone\"&gt;Diego Simeone&lt;/a&gt;. Sensini then went to manage &lt;a href=\"Newell%27s%20Old%20Boys\"&gt;Newell's Old Boys&lt;/a&gt; for the Clausura 2009 tournament. In April 2011, he resigned after two years as head coach of Newell's Old Boys after Lepra's sixth loss in nine games, leaving them 19th in the Clausura table.\nOn 21 February 2012, Sensini was appointed as the new head coach of Argentine first division club &lt;a href=\"Col%C3%B3n%20de%20Santa%20Fe\"&gt;Col\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. He resigned on 16 March 2013 after a 1\u20130 loss against rivals &lt;a href=\"San%20Lorenzo%20de%20Almagro\"&gt;San Lorenzo&lt;/a&gt;, following a row of eight matches without winning.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1996 Sensini took &lt;a href=\"Italian%20nationality%20law\"&gt;Italian citizenship&lt;/a&gt;. He is an &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Argentine\"&gt;Italian Argentine&lt;/a&gt;, whose grandfather Pacifico Sensini emigrated from &lt;a href=\"Macerata\"&gt;Macerata&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Rosario%2C%20Santa%20Fe\"&gt;Rosario, Santa Fe&lt;/a&gt; in 1911.\nHonours.\nClub.\nNewell's Old Boys\nParma\nLazio"
