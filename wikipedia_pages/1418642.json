    "text": "The City of Langley, commonly referred to as Langley City, or just Langley, is a municipality in the &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Vancouver%20Regional%20District\"&gt;Metro Vancouver Regional District&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. It lies directly east of &lt;a href=\"Surrey%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt;, adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"Cloverdale%2C%20Surrey\"&gt;Cloverdale&lt;/a&gt; area, and is surrounded on the north, east and south by the &lt;a href=\"Langley%2C%20British%20Columbia%20%28district%20municipality%29\"&gt;Township of Langley&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly European settlement in the area was known as \"Innes Corners\" (after homesteader Adam Innes); in 1911, the area became known as \"Langley Prairie\", part of the Township of Langley a.k.a. &lt;a href=\"Langley%2C%20British%20Columbia%20%28district%20municipality%29\"&gt;Langley Township&lt;/a&gt; since 1873. Twentieth-century improvements in transportation access, including the construction of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia%20Electric%20Railway\"&gt;British Columbia Electric Railway&lt;/a&gt; in 1910, &lt;a href=\"Fraser%20Highway\"&gt;Fraser Highway&lt;/a&gt; in the 1920s, and &lt;a href=\"Pattullo%20Bridge\"&gt;Pattullo Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in 1937, profoundly impacted the area, transforming it from rural into the main urban and commercial core of the Township. In turn, this birthed the need for upgraded and new amenities, especially with respect to health, infrastructure, safety and sanitation.\nThe municipal government, however, refused to finance these projects as it bowed, instead, to politically influential farming communities and smaller, mostly rural, business centres, like &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Langley\"&gt;Fort Langley&lt;/a&gt;, Milner and &lt;a href=\"Murrayville%2C%20Langley\"&gt;Murrayville&lt;/a&gt;, that viewed such spending as unnecessary. Talk of secession began in Langley Prairie in the 1930s, as a result. Headed by a panel of important residents and businesspersons, including Richard Langdon, president of the Langley Board of Trade, the push for independence came to a head in the 1950s.\nSpecifically, two issues decided Langley's future. Street lights, which Langley Prairie argued were not only needed for safety but also progress, but on which &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Langley%2C%20British%20Columbia%20%28district%20municipality%29\"&gt;reeve&lt;/a&gt; George Brooks declared \"not a nickel\" would be spent. As well, Langley Prairie's belief that it did not have the political sway or its fair share of municipal services that it deserved relative to its local tax contribution. Langley Prairie by now constituted 20% of the Township's tax base. A referendum on secession was therefore held in September, 1954. It passed with over 85% of the vote. Langley Prairie officially seceded and became the City of Langley on March 15, 1955.\nCity plan.\nRoad network.\nLangley City follows the same block system as its neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Langley%2C%20British%20Columbia%20%28district%20municipality%29%23Road%20Network\"&gt;Township of Langley&lt;/a&gt; as well as other Districts in the Fraser Valley, where Streets run North-South, and Avenues run East-West.\nDevelopment barriers.\nMany natural and artificial barriers prevent Langley City from following a complete tidy grid:\nThis has affected development in a number of ways, for example, the Langley Bypass turns 45 degrees in the North-West, tracing the boundary outline since it was constructed by the City and could not go over the boundary into the Langley Township. Many streets come to an abrupt halt when reaching the river and continue on the other side without a connecting bridge. Roads such as Douglas Crescent, Logan Avenue, and Eastleigh Crescent parallel the 45-degree angles of Fraser Highway and Glover Road, almost proposing an alternative grid at an angle which conflicts with the grid in place. Even Grade Crescent, which is much further south than these roads, follows this same angle, demonstrating the impact &lt;a href=\"Fraser%20Highway\"&gt;Fraser Highway&lt;/a&gt; had on the development of Langley.\nDowntown.\nLangley City's Downtown was developed around &lt;a href=\"Old%20Yale%20Road\"&gt;Old Yale Road&lt;/a&gt;, which later on became &lt;a href=\"Fraser%20Highway\"&gt;Fraser Highway&lt;/a&gt;. Until 1964, Fraser Highway was part of the &lt;a href=\"Trans-Canada%20Highway\"&gt;Trans-Canada Highway&lt;/a&gt; network - this major route attracted many businesses to the area.\nToday, with the &lt;a href=\"Trans-Canada%20Highway\"&gt;Trans-Canada Highway&lt;/a&gt; now in the north of the &lt;a href=\"Langley%2C%20British%20Columbia%20%28district%20municipality%29\"&gt;Langley Township&lt;/a&gt;, the downtown is more pedestrian oriented. Where Fraser Highway goes through the downtown it is reduced to a single lane of traffic in one direction to limit traffic flow. This stretch is often affectionately referred to by residents as \"The One-Way\" and is lined with restaurants and shops on either side, making it a retail centre in the city. Douglas Park is also near this area in the downtown and is seen as the main park in the city, frequently being used for events and shows.\nIn Summer 2013, McBurney Plaza opened to the public replacing McBurney Lane (previously used as a parking lot). This area connects Fraser Highway and Douglas Park with a pedestrian boulevard, providing outdoor space for cafes and space the city can use for street performance and other civic events.\nJust outside this downtown centre are &lt;a href=\"strip%20mall\"&gt;strip mall&lt;/a&gt;s and a number of &lt;a href=\"Low-rise\"&gt;low rise&lt;/a&gt; apartment buildings. Most detached housing remains outside the downtown area.\nParks.\nThere are over 17 public parks in this city. They range from small neighbourhood adventure playgrounds, to larger parks with nature trails, wildlife, and various sporting fields and equipment.\nBrydon Park.\nThis park contains an adventure playground, a paved play area for ball hockey and basketball, an intermediate soccer field, and a softball diamond. Public washrooms are available. Brydon Lagoon is south of the park and has a peaceful perimeter walk around the lagoon where one may observe wildfowl and turtles.\nCity Park.\nThis park features Al Anderson Memorial Pool, a children\u2019s waterpark and playground, a lacrosse box, twelve picnic tables, and public washrooms. A covered picnic shelter that can accommodate up to 75 people is available and can be booked for a picnic.\nUplands Dog Off-Leash Park.\nThis is an 18-acre, fully fenced area with a perimeter walking path. Dogs and their owners can meet and enjoy a large open space for walking and playing. There is also a drinking fountain designed for both dogs and people.\nDouglas Park.\nDouglas Park is located at the &lt;a href=\"Intersection%20%28road%29\"&gt;intersection&lt;/a&gt; of Douglas Crescent and 206th Street in Langley, &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, Canada.\nThe park contains an adventure playground, two tennis courts, a water park (seasonal), bowling green, sports box, basketball hoops and public washrooms. It also has an outdoor covered performance platform called \"Langley Spirit Square\". Langley Spirit Square is the site of an annual Shakespeare performance, \"Bard in the Valley.\"\nDouglas Recreation Centre, situated in the park, offers many programs for the citizens of Langley and is also available for rentals such as wedding receptions or banquets and other events.\nIn 2000, there were plans to build a library in the park, but public opposition forced the library be built elsewhere. In 1971, Langley's city council had plans to install a &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20garden\"&gt;Chinese garden&lt;/a&gt; in the park, but this was never carried out. In 1982, a &lt;a href=\"day%20care\"&gt;day care&lt;/a&gt; centre in the park was replaced by a &lt;a href=\"bowls\"&gt;bowls&lt;/a&gt; meeting house and a &lt;a href=\"bowling%20green\"&gt;bowling green&lt;/a&gt; was established adjacent to it.\nDouglas Park is the main park in the City of Langley for events, festivals and other civic activities. Featuring a permanent stage, the park is equipped for live performance of music, theatre and other arts.\nLinwood Park.\nThis park contains a fenced dog park and a wheelchair accessible playground. Public washrooms are available.\nNicomekl Park.\nThis park has a suitable parking area and is the starting point to enter the floodplain and various walking trails.\nPenzer Action Park.\nThis park is home to North America's largest Parkour Course, with an in-ground trampoline, numerous climbing walls, balance beams, and swinging bars will provide hours of creative physical fun. In addition, there is a kid size parkour course, a basketball court with optional volleyball net, dirt jumps for mountain bike enthusiasts, and a pump track. A nature trail passes through the park.\nRotary Centennial Park.\nThis park contains a playground, ball diamond, senior soccer field, display garden beds, and public washrooms. A paved walking path follows the perimeter, and the facilities are wheelchair accessible.\nSendall Gardens.\nThis park contains botanical gardens that feature 3.67 acres of plants, shrubs and trees. A nature trail passes through this park, and there are two duck ponds. There are several varieties of wildfowl in the park, including geese and ducks. The tropical greenhouse has a wide variety of exotic plants and is open to the public April 1 to October 1.\nSports.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Langley%20Rams\"&gt;Langley Rams&lt;/a&gt; of the British Columbia Conference of the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Junior%20Football%20League\"&gt;Canadian Junior Football League&lt;/a&gt; are based at the MacLeod Stadium in the &lt;a href=\"Township%20of%20Langley\"&gt;Township of Langley&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Langley%20Rivermen\"&gt;Langley Rivermen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;British Columbia Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vancouver%20Giants\"&gt;Vancouver Giants&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;Western Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; are based at the &lt;a href=\"Langley%20Events%20Centre\"&gt;Langley Events Centre&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Township%20of%20Langley\"&gt;Township of Langley&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Langley%20Blaze\"&gt;Langley Blaze&lt;/a&gt; of the Premier Baseball League is based at McLeod Park.\nA local Little League baseball team represented Canada in the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Little%20League%20World%20Series\"&gt;2011 Little League World Series&lt;/a&gt; in Williamsport, PA.\n&lt;a href=\"Brett%20Lawrie\"&gt;Brett Lawrie&lt;/a&gt;, an infielder for the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; is from Langley, as is professional cyclist Svein Tuft of the Greenedge Cycling Team.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Langley%20Thunder\"&gt;Langley Thunder&lt;/a&gt; is a Senior A team in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Lacrosse%20Association\"&gt;Western Lacrosse Association&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Lacrosse%20Association\"&gt;Canadian Lacrosse Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\n&lt;a href=\"School%20District%2035%20Langley\"&gt;School District 35 Langley&lt;/a&gt; operates public schools.\nThe City of Langley is home to six Elementary schools and one &lt;a href=\"Middle%20school\"&gt;Middle school&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"H.%20D.%20Stafford%20Middle%20School\"&gt;H.
