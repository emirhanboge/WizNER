    "text": "The Battle of Ray was fought between the &lt;a href=\"Sasanians\"&gt;Sasanians&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rashidun%20Caliphate\"&gt;Rashidun Caliphate&lt;/a&gt; in 651. It was also part of the rivalry between the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Ispahbudhan\"&gt;Ispahbudhan family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Mihran\"&gt;Mihran family&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn 642/643, the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20Arabs\"&gt;Muslim Arabs&lt;/a&gt; had conquered &lt;a href=\"Media%20%28region%29\"&gt;Media&lt;/a&gt;, and continued to penetrate into the &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20plateau\"&gt;Iranian plateau&lt;/a&gt;. In 651, &lt;a href=\"Farrukhzad\"&gt;Farrukhzad&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"spahbed\"&gt;spahbed&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Khorasan\"&gt;Khorasan&lt;/a&gt;, and minister of &lt;a href=\"Yazdegerd%20III\"&gt;Yazdegerd III&lt;/a&gt;, mutinied and left for &lt;a href=\"Tabaristan\"&gt;Tabaristan&lt;/a&gt;. On his way to Tabaristan, he met the Arab general Nu'aym near &lt;a href=\"Qazvin\"&gt;Qazvin&lt;/a&gt;, and made peace with him. He then agreed to aid the Arabs against his rival &lt;a href=\"Siyavakhsh\"&gt;Siyavakhsh&lt;/a&gt;, who had murdered his father in 631.\nBattle.\nThe combined Ispahbudhan-Arab army engaged in a night battle against Siyavakhsh's army at the foot of the mountain just outside Ray. Farrukhzad led some of Nu'aim's cavalry by a little-known route into the city, from whence they emerged to attack the defenders' rear, causing great slaughter. To set an example, Nu'aym ordered the destruction of the Old Town, which called \"al-Atiqah\" by the Arabs, (perhaps the aristocratic quarter of Ray). However, the town was later rebuilt by &lt;a href=\"Farrukhzad\"&gt;Farrukhzad&lt;/a&gt;, whom became the ruler of Ray."
