    "text": "The Butcher Boy is a 1997 Irish &lt;a href=\"black%20comedy\"&gt;black comedy&lt;/a&gt; film directed by &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Jordan\"&gt;Neil Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. The film was based on &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McCabe%20%28novelist%29\"&gt;Patrick McCabe\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20Boy%20%28novel%29\"&gt;1992 novel of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jordan.\nSet in the early 1960s, \"The Butcher Boy\" is about Francie Brady (&lt;a href=\"Eamonn%20Owens\"&gt;Eamonn Owens&lt;/a&gt;), a 12-year-old boy who retreats into a violent fantasy world to escape the reality of his dysfunctional family; as his circumstances worsen, his sanity deteriorates and he begins acting out, with increasing brutality. The film won the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Bear%20for%20Best%20Director\"&gt;Silver Bear for Best Director&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"48th%20Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;48th Berlin International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; in 1998 and a Special Mention for Owens \"astonishing lead\". It also won the &lt;a href=\"European%20Film%20Award\"&gt;European Film Award&lt;/a&gt; for Best Cinematographer for &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Biddle\"&gt;Adrian Biddle&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Butcher Boy\" was also the final film produced by &lt;a href=\"The%20Geffen%20Film%20Company\"&gt;The Geffen Film Company&lt;/a&gt;, and was released before their closure in 1998.\nPlot.\nThe film is set in Ireland in the early 1960s in the small town of &lt;a href=\"Clones%2C%20County%20Monaghan\"&gt;Clones&lt;/a&gt;. Francie Brady is a 12-year-old boy whose imagination is fuelled by &lt;a href=\"television\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Extraterrestrial%20life\"&gt;aliens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communists&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Atomic%20Age\"&gt;Atomic Age&lt;/a&gt;. When his mother suffers a &lt;a href=\"nervous%20breakdown\"&gt;nervous breakdown&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately commits suicide, he is left in the care of his father, an emotionally distant and ill-tempered &lt;a href=\"alcoholic\"&gt;alcoholic&lt;/a&gt;. Francie spends most of his time with his best friend Joe Purcell talking about \"gangsters, cowboys and Indians, &lt;a href=\"Comic%20book\"&gt;comic-book&lt;/a&gt; monsters and the early-1960s threat of &lt;a href=\"Doomsday%20device\"&gt;nuclear annihilation&lt;/a&gt;.\" However, when Francie's growing conflict with another boy, Phillip Nugent, and his mother begins to go too far, he ends up at &lt;a href=\"reform%20school\"&gt;reform school&lt;/a&gt;. Here, he is &lt;a href=\"child%20molestation\"&gt;molested&lt;/a&gt; by Father Sullivan, and finds solace only in his fantasies about a foul-mouthed &lt;a href=\"Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29\"&gt;Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt;. He returns home to find Joe has outgrown him and befriended Phillip Nugent. Before long, his father has drunk himself to death. Faced with being left completely alone in the world, Francie loses his grip on reality and lashes out with uncontrollable brutality, which shocks his provincial hometown.\nProduction.\nThe screen rights to the book were bought by &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Jordan\"&gt;Neil Jordan&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 during the filming of \"&lt;a href=\"Interview%20with%20the%20Vampire%20%28film%29\"&gt;Interview with the Vampire&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Film%20adaptation\"&gt;adaptation&lt;/a&gt; is mostly faithful to the novel, but there are some differences, the principal change being the ending. In the book, Francie is not seen to leave prison, and attempts to forge a friendship with an inmate similar to the one he had with Joe. In the film, a much older Francie is released from prison at the end to be brought to a &lt;a href=\"halfway%20house\"&gt;halfway house&lt;/a&gt;. He picks a &lt;a href=\"snowdrop\"&gt;snowdrop&lt;/a&gt;, echoing the opening of the film.\n&lt;a href=\"Casting%20%28performing%20arts%29\"&gt;Casting&lt;/a&gt; the child to play Francie was difficult. With no previous filming experiences, Eamonn Owens and Alan Boyle (who played Francie's best friend, Joe) were found at the local school in &lt;a href=\"Killeshandra\"&gt;Killeshandra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"County%20Cavan\"&gt;County Cavan&lt;/a&gt; where casting assistant Maureen Hughes went to visit her uncle. Owens younger brother Ciaran was also cast. Jordan cast O'Connor because \"she looks like the &lt;a href=\"Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29\"&gt;Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAdaptation.\n&lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McCabe%20%28novelist%29\"&gt;Patrick McCabe&lt;/a&gt;'s accomplishment with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20Boy%20%28novel%29\"&gt;The Butcher Boy&lt;/a&gt;\" was deemed unattainable in a film. During the &lt;a href=\"screenwriting\"&gt;screenwriting&lt;/a&gt; process, McCabe wrote two drafts that digressed from the original novel, like \"planets within planets within planets\" according to Jordan, consequently, Jordan wrote the third draft that was more faithful to the novel. Jordan cast McCabe in the role of town drunk Jimmy the Skite.\nJordan captures Francie's mental illness by using &lt;a href=\"voice-over\"&gt;voice-over&lt;/a&gt;s where the adult narrator Francie speaks with the child Francie. Andrew O'Hehir at Salon Entertainment criticizes Jordan and McCabe for an occasional \"flavor of an after-school special purveying &lt;a href=\"didactic\"&gt;didactic&lt;/a&gt; lessons about &lt;a href=\"physical%20abuse\"&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt; and victimization,\" and losing \"the novel's &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Beckett\"&gt;Beckettian&lt;/a&gt; ambiguity.\" However, he argues that Jordan \"brings a tenderness and sweetness\" to the otherwise unforgiving &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Asubject-matter\"&gt;subject matter&lt;/a&gt;.\nReception.\nThe reception of the film has been generally positive. Review aggregator &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Tomatoes\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; shows a 77% rating based on 61 reviews and an average rating of 7.4/10. Andrew O'Hehir at Salon Entertainment says \"Neil Jordan's sweetly &lt;a href=\"tragicomedy\"&gt;tragicomic&lt;/a&gt; movie\" has \"elaborate &lt;a href=\"fantasy\"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; sequences [that] feel like irrelevant amusements.\" He also praises the film as \"a compelling exploration of the permeable border between normal childhood and full-on &lt;a href=\"insanity\"&gt;insanity&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nJeffrey M. Anderson at Combustible Celluloid calls the film \"a roller-coaster ride for your brain. It's the most alive and deeply-felt movie I've seen in 1998.\" &lt;a href=\"Emanuel%20Levy\"&gt;Emanuel Levy&lt;/a&gt; at \"&lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;\" says it is \"Neil Jordan's most accomplished and brilliant film to date.\"\nOwens received widespread acclaim for his performance; he was awarded a Special Mention at the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Berlin Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; in 1998.\nThe film grossed \u00a31,807,666 ($3 million) in the UK and Ireland, the highest-grossing Irish film of the year. In the United States and Canada, it grossed $1,995,911 for a worldwide total of over $5 million.\nAwards.\n\"The Butcher Boy\" won the following awards:\nSoundtrack.\n&lt;a href=\"Elliot%20Goldenthal\"&gt;Elliot Goldenthal&lt;/a&gt; composed the &lt;a href=\"soundtrack\"&gt;soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; for the film, which was released on CD in 1998. Goldenthal for this score mixes many different &lt;a href=\"music%20genre\"&gt;music genre&lt;/a&gt;s and styles, yet this is one of his most melodic scores. The title song is performed by &lt;a href=\"Sin%C3%A9ad%20O%27Connor\"&gt;Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDVD release.\nA &lt;a href=\"widescreen\"&gt;widescreen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"closed-captioned\"&gt;closed-captioned&lt;/a&gt; version of the film was released on DVD on 13 February 2007 by &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Home%20Video\"&gt;Warner Home Video&lt;/a&gt;. The disc contains &lt;a href=\"deleted%20scene\"&gt;deleted scene&lt;/a&gt;s and an &lt;a href=\"audio%20commentary\"&gt;audio commentary&lt;/a&gt; by Neil Jordan."
