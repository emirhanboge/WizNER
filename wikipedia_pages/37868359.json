The site is a &lt;a href=\"Vihara\"&gt;Buddhist Monastery&lt;/a&gt; and is believed to have been used by pre-Islamic Maldivians dating back to the 7th to 8th century AD. The excavation work was done in various periods from February 1996 through 1998. During this period, an area of 1,880m2 was excavated, revealing 64 coral stone structures. For the vast majority, only the lower most parts have been preserved.\nWeathering and erosion.\nDue to the exposed nature of the archaeological site, and the fact that the structures were of coral stone, the site soon started showing signs of weathering and erosion.

Blake Jr.&lt;/a&gt; handed over the a grant of 370,000 &lt;a href=\"Rufiyaa\"&gt;Rufiyaa&lt;/a&gt; ($28,950) under the &lt;a href=\"Ambassadors%20Fund%20for%20Cultural%20Preservation\"&gt;Ambassador\u2019s Fund for Cultural Preservation&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim of helping the conservation efforts."
