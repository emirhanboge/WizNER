    "text": "Whitefield is a &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Co%C3%B6s%20County%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Co\u00f6s County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire\"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, United States, in the &lt;a href=\"White%20Mountains%20Region\"&gt;White Mountains Region&lt;/a&gt;. The population was 2,490 at the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20census\"&gt;2020 census&lt;/a&gt;. Situated on the northern edge of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Mountains%20%28New%20Hampshire%29\"&gt;White Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Whitefield is home to the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Washington%20Regional%20Airport\"&gt;Mount Washington Regional Airport&lt;/a&gt; and the White Mountains Regional High School.\nWhitefield is part of the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, NH\u2013&lt;a href=\"Vermont\"&gt;VT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20micropolitan%20area\"&gt;Micropolitan Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt;. The central village in the town, where 1,460 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the &lt;a href=\"Whitefield%20%28CDP%29%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Whitefield census-designated place&lt;/a&gt; (CDP) and is located at the junction of &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%203\"&gt;U.S. Route 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire%20Route%20116\"&gt;New Hampshire Route 116&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire%20Route%20142\"&gt;NH Route 142&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe last town to be granted under the &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; provincial government, Whitefield was chartered on July 4, 1774, exactly two years before adoption of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. Some believe it was named for &lt;a href=\"George%20Whitefield\"&gt;George Whitefield&lt;/a&gt;, a famous English &lt;a href=\"Evangelism\"&gt;evangelist&lt;/a&gt; and a friend of &lt;a href=\"William%20Legge%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Dartmouth\"&gt;William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth&lt;/a&gt;, the patron of &lt;a href=\"Dartmouth%20College\"&gt;Dartmouth College&lt;/a&gt;. Others believe the name originated from earlier references to the snowy white fields one would see upon approach through any of the surrounding mountain passages. The chartered name was \"Whitefields\", but the \"s\" was dropped on December 1, 1804, the date of incorporation. Early grantees included &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Belknap\"&gt;Jeremy Belknap&lt;/a&gt;, historian, and &lt;a href=\"John%20Langdon%20%28politician%29\"&gt;John Langdon&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded &lt;a href=\"Sir%20John%20Wentworth%2C%201st%20Baronet\"&gt;John Wentworth&lt;/a&gt; as governor.\nWith the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"railroad\"&gt;railroad&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century, tourists discovered the town and its cool, clean mountain air. They sought relief from the heat, humidity and pollution of coal-era summers in &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hartford%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Hartford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. Several inns and hotels were built to accommodate their increasing numbers. On a hilltop facing the &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Range\"&gt;Presidential Range&lt;/a&gt; is the grandest, the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20View%20House\"&gt;Mountain View House&lt;/a&gt; (now called the Mountain View Grand Resort &amp; Spa), established in 1866. The historic hotel underwent an extensive renovation in the 2000s, and is now one of the most luxurious in New Hampshire.\nWhitefield has many examples of &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20architecture\"&gt;Victorian architecture&lt;/a&gt;, including a landmark &lt;a href=\"bandstand\"&gt;bandstand&lt;/a&gt; built in 1875 on the &lt;a href=\"common%20land\"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt;. The century-old town hall with bell tower was torn down in 2013. At the 2014 town meeting, voters chose to build a pre-fab building to be located outside of the town center.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.37%, are water. Whitefield is drained by the &lt;a href=\"Johns%20River%20%28New%20Hampshire%29\"&gt;Johns River&lt;/a&gt;, which runs through the center of town, and its tributary Bog Brook. Forest Lake, the largest lake in town, straddles the Whitefield/&lt;a href=\"Dalton%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Dalton&lt;/a&gt; town line and is located southwest of the town center. Burns Lake is near Forest Lake, off &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire%20Route%20116\"&gt;Route 116&lt;/a&gt; closer to the town center. Mirror Lake is a small water body close to &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%203\"&gt;Route 3&lt;/a&gt; north of the center of town.\nThe two highest points in Whitefield are Howland Hill and Kimball Hill, both of which top above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemographics.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2010, there were 2,306 people, 976 households, and 613 families residing in the town.
