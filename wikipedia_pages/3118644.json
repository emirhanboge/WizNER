    "text": "USS \"Preston\" (DD\u2013379) was a in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; before and during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. She was the fifth Navy ship named for &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20%28U.S.%20Navy%29\"&gt;Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20W.%20Preston\"&gt;Samuel W. Preston&lt;/a&gt; (1840\u20131865).\n\"Preston\" was &lt;a href=\"Keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 27 October 1934 at the &lt;a href=\"Mare%20Island%20Navy%20Yard\"&gt;Mare Island Navy Yard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vallejo%2C%20California\"&gt;Vallejo, California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ship%20naming%20and%20launching\"&gt;and launched&lt;/a&gt; on 22 April 1936. She was sponsored by Mrs. Edward H. Campbell, &lt;a href=\"ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 27 October 1936, with &lt;a href=\"Commander%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; C.\u00a0D. Swain in command.\nHistory.\nFollowing shakedown, \"Preston\" operated briefly under the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations\"&gt;Chief of Naval Operations&lt;/a&gt;, then joined &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Force\"&gt;Battle Force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fleet\"&gt;U.S. Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. Initially assigned to Destroyer Squadron 2 (DesRon\u00a02), then shifted to DesRon\u00a05, she conducted peacetime training exercises in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific\"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt; until 7 December 1941. Patrol and coastal escort duties along the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;west coast&lt;/a&gt; kept \"Preston\" in the eastern Pacific until 1 June 1942. Then setting a westward course she headed for &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; in the screen of the &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt; . Arriving on 6 June, her group, TG\u00a011.1, departed again the next day to rendezvous with &lt;a href=\"Task%20Force%2017\"&gt;Task Force 17&lt;/a&gt; (TF17) and deliver planes, pilots, and material to the carriers and as that force refueled and rested after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Midway\"&gt;Battle of Midway&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 13 June, \"Preston\" returned to &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and for the next four months conducted type exercises and performed patrol and escort work in the Hawaiian area. She joined TF\u00a016 on 4 October, and on 15 October sailed for the &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Islands\"&gt;Solomon Islands&lt;/a&gt;. On 24 October, TF\u00a016 rendezvoused with TF\u00a017, formed TF\u00a061, and continued on. Two days later, \"Preston\", in the carrier screen, introduced her guns to the enemy at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Santa%20Cruz%20Islands\"&gt;Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Downing two planes, she emerged unscathed from her first engagement and retired to &lt;a href=\"Noum%C3%A9a\"&gt;Noum\u00e9a&lt;/a&gt;.\nRearmed, she headed back to the Solomons for her second and last fight. On the evening of 14 November, \"Preston\", with TF\u00a064, sailed along the western end of &lt;a href=\"Guadalcanal\"&gt;Guadalcanal&lt;/a&gt; to intercept another &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese run down the \u201c&lt;a href=\"New%20Georgia%20Sound%23WWII%E2%80%94The%20Slot\"&gt;Slot&lt;/a&gt;\u201d to bombard &lt;a href=\"Henderson%20Field%20%28Guadalcanal%29\"&gt;Henderson Field&lt;/a&gt; and land reinforcements. Swinging around &lt;a href=\"Savo%20Island\"&gt;Savo Island&lt;/a&gt;, the force, two &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s preceded by four destroyers, entered the channel between Savo and &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Esperance\"&gt;Cape Esperance&lt;/a&gt;. At 23:00, the battleship picked up the on her radar, and, at 23:17, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Battle%20of%20Savo%20Island\"&gt;Third Battle of Savo Island&lt;/a&gt; began.\n\"Sendai\", accompanied by the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20destroyer%20Shikinami%20%281929%29\"&gt;destroyer \"Shikinami\"&lt;/a&gt;, had been following the Americans, but projectiles drove them off. Soon after, however, the battle was rejoined. The Japanese force had been dispersed and within minutes of the battleship/&lt;a href=\"cruiser\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt; encounter, enemy destroyers, edging along the southern shore of Savo, entered the fray. and \"Preston\" followed. , which had been firing illumination shells toward the earlier gunfire exchange, came into the action in time to sight the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20cruiser%20Nagara\"&gt;cruiser \"Nagara\"&lt;/a&gt; and four destroyers closing in. Farther out, heavier Japanese ships were preparing to join in. The concentrated American destroyers were now central targets.\nApproximately eight minutes after the enemy was engaged, was hit. Soon after, \"Preston\", preparing her torpedoes, was struck. One salvo from \"Nagara\" had put both firerooms out and toppled the afterstack. Her fires made an easier target and shells came in from both port and starboard; there is the possibility that the shells coming in from port were from friendly ships (Lundgren, 291f). The fires spread. At 23:36, she was ordered abandoned. Seconds later she rolled on her side. She floated for another ten minutes, bow in the air; then sank, taking 116 of her crew with her.\nThe battle continued. \"Gwin\" now became the target of Japanese guns. Shells exploded in an engine room and on the fantail. At 23:38, \"Walke\"s forecastle was blown off. \"Benham\"s bow was all but demolished; she would go down on 15 November. \"Walke\" soon followed \"Preston\" to the Savo Island graveyard. At 23:48, as the battleships took over, the remaining destroyers were ordered to retire. In the ensuing duel, \"Washington\" inflicted irreparable damage on the Japanese bombardment force and remained unscathed. However, was exposed by searchlight and took shells from that enemy force. The Japanese had again scored heavily, but in doing so had lost a battleship and a destroyer, and, more important, had abandoned their mission of bombarding Henderson Field into uselessness.\nAwards.\n\"Preston\" earned two &lt;a href=\"battle%20star\"&gt;battle star&lt;/a&gt;s for World War II service."
