    "text": "J\u0101nis Medi\u0146\u0161 (October 9, 1890 \u2014 March 4, 1966) was a &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt;. He was born in &lt;a href=\"Riga\"&gt;Riga&lt;/a&gt;. \nHe was a vital force in musical life during the short-lived first independent Latvian republic (1918\u201440). He almost singlehandly established in his country both the &lt;a href=\"ballet\"&gt;ballet&lt;/a&gt;ic genre \u2013 with \"M\u012blas uzvara\" (\u2018Love's Victory\u2019, 1934) \u2013 and the &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic with \"Uguns un nakts\" (\u2018Fire and Night\u2019, 1913\u201419) and \"Dievi un cilv\u0113ki\" (\u2018Gods and People\u2019, 1921). It was as a result of multiple invasions of his country that Medi\u0146\u0161 left Latvia in 1944, eventually settling for good in &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nJ\u0101nis Medi\u0146\u0161's &lt;a href=\"memoir\"&gt;memoir&lt;/a&gt; \"To\u0146i un pusto\u0146i\" (\u2018Tones and Semitones\u2019, published in &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; in 1964), provides posterity with many details of his early years. As an old man \u2013 it was written between autumn 1962 and spring 1963 in collaboration with J\u0101nis Rudz\u012btis \u2013 he characterised his life as \u2018rich in experience, though difficult ... having lived through Tsarist eras [Latvia was under &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n rule until 1918], Latvian independence [including the dictatorship of &lt;a href=\"K%C4%81rlis%20Ulmanis\"&gt;K\u0101rlis Ulmanis&lt;/a&gt; 1934\u201240], &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; occupation [1940 and again in 1944] and &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; occupation, finally\u2019. Unlike many of his Latvian contemporaries, he \u2018had no famous teachers and had to find [his] own way musically\u2019. But he had the advantage in being born into a highly musical family: his brother Jekabs taught at a seminary of music teachers in &lt;a href=\"Valmiera\"&gt;Valmiera&lt;/a&gt; (one of the first music education institutions in Latvia). His father was also a musician and took his children to concerts. J\u0101nis started to play the &lt;a href=\"piano\"&gt;piano&lt;/a&gt; aged four or five, and was taught to read music by his sister Marija, with whom he played duets. Marija gave recitals as a solo pianist and in duos and other &lt;a href=\"chamber%20music\"&gt;chamber ensembles&lt;/a&gt;. She died young in 1912 from an accidental overdose resulting from a mistake in a pharmacy. Another brother \u2013 J\u0101zeps \u2013became another notable figure in Latvian music of the first half of the 20th century, and one of the country's first &lt;a href=\"symphony\"&gt;symphonists&lt;/a&gt;.\nJ\u0101nis studied the violin, \u2018cello and piano at the &lt;a href=\"Em%C4%ABls%20Zigerts\"&gt;Em\u012bls Zigerts&lt;/a&gt; Institute (later renamed the First Riga Musical Institute). On Zigerts\u2019s death, J\u0101zeps took over as director and soon the whole Medi\u0146\u0161 family installed themselves in the premises, their mother becoming housekeeper. J\u0101nis was introduced to German opera, and acquainted himself with a library of some 50,000 scores that J\u0101zeps had obtained for the Institute. By the time of his graduation in 1909 J\u0101nis had already started teaching there.\nAlthough he spent early years in Riga, J\u0101nis frequently visited cousins in rural districts. He played the organ in a village church (in &lt;a href=\"Skaistkalne\"&gt;Skaistkalne&lt;/a&gt;) while still at school. He also occasionally looked after sheep in pigs in a relatives\u2019 &lt;a href=\"smallholding\"&gt;smallholding&lt;/a&gt;, and worked in a windmill and sold the flour in markets. He wrote his first composition aged 11, called \"Sudmali\u0146as\" (\u2018Windmill\u2019) for piano, but many early pieces were lost due to his mother's habit of using paper lying around the house to wrap up herrings brought from the market. But he never thought he would become a composer and so chose instrumental classes in order to become an orchestral musician. However, he considered his experience as a working performer to have been a far better training in orchestration than any theoretical study.\nThe M\u0101mu\u013c\u0101 Association had been founded in Riga in 1904 and both J\u0101nis and J\u0101zeps soon started playing in their theatre orchestra, the Fischer Kappella. They performed operas including \"&lt;a href=\"Undina%20%28Tchaikovsky%29\"&gt;Undine&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Life%20for%20the%20Tsar\"&gt;A Life for the Tsar&lt;/a&gt;\". The society's theatre was destroyed by fire 1907 and relocated to the Interimteatr\u012b, where they played &lt;a href=\"J%C4%81zeps%20V%C4%ABtols\"&gt;J\u0101zeps V\u012btols&lt;/a&gt;'s music for &lt;a href=\"Aspazija\"&gt;Aspazija&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s drama \"Vaidelote\". J\u0101nis later described these experiences as \u2018part of the period of awakening of Latvian art\u2019. During summer months, the orchestra relocated to &lt;a href=\"Haapsalu\"&gt;Haapsalu&lt;/a&gt; on the Baltic; the town was often populated by Russian musicians but, being the only pianist in the orchestra, J\u0101nis was in great demand and there played a large amount of chamber repertoire and got to know the latest Russian song repertoire (including &lt;a href=\"Rachmaninoff\"&gt;Rachmaninoff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arensky\"&gt;Arensky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gli%C3%A8re\"&gt;Gli\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Tchaikovsky\"&gt;Tchaikovsky&lt;/a&gt; had spent one summer there; decades later Medi\u0146\u0161 heard &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Glazunov\"&gt;Glazunov&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s brother listening to music as he passed his house.\nManaging to avoid army call up, from 1909 J\u0101nis took various odd jobs around Riga (including working in a piano shop, in orchestras and making recordings of Latvian art music and folksongs). In 1913 he started work as violist in the orchestra of Latvian Opera, under &lt;a href=\"P%C4%81vuls%20Jurj%C4%81ns\"&gt;P\u0101vuls Jurj\u0101ns&lt;/a&gt; (the orchestra he was later to conduct himself). He first conducted when taking part in another amateur orchestra, this time made up from mostly factory workers from the island &lt;a href=\"Sarkandaugava\"&gt;Sarkandaugava&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts of Riga. The next time was in the Latvian Opera: Jurj\u0101ns had noticed his ability when standing in as chorus-master, and suggested he conduct performances of works already in the repertoire (\"Life for the Tsar\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28opera%29\"&gt;The Demon&lt;/a&gt;\"). For these he travelled to &lt;a href=\"Kharkov\"&gt;Kharkov&lt;/a&gt;, where he also visited the composer &lt;a href=\"Andrejs%20Jurj%C4%81ns\"&gt;Andrejs Jurj\u0101ns&lt;/a&gt; (1856\u20141922), a founder of Latvian art music and, by that time, deaf.\nDebut.\nJ\u0101nis made his debut as a composer with the performance in 1912 of two songs for chorus. Around this time (or soon after) he started work on his opera \"Uguns un nakts\" (\u2018Flames and Night\u2019), and P. Jurj\u0101ns organised performances of sections of this work. Actor and director &lt;a href=\"J%C4%93kabs%20Duburs\"&gt;J\u0113kabs Duburs&lt;/a&gt; heard these extracts, and with fellow-businessmen sponsored J\u0101nis to give up his orchestral position in order to continue work on the opera. As the front approached in 1914, in further attempts to avoid enlistment, J\u0101zeps and J\u0101nis decided to go to Moscow. After a concert tour, the brothers came home to find their father delirious; J\u0101nis left for &lt;a href=\"St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; after the father's funeral. However, he did serve as conductor of the Latvian Riflemen's band for some portion of the war.\n1920s.\nDuring the early 1920s he wrote the first of the 'dainas', and these were followed by a host of orchestral compositions (three suites, &lt;a href=\"concerto\"&gt;concerto&lt;/a&gt;s for violin and piano etc.) and stage works (the opera \"Spr\u012bd\u012btis\" [Tom Thumb], 1925, the ballet \"M\u012blas uzvara\" [Love's Victory], 1934, and \"Lutekl\u012bte\" [The Little Darling] a children's opera of 1939, in addition to the above-mentioned). Additionally, his public career flourished: he became conductor of the &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20National%20Opera\"&gt;Latvian National Opera&lt;/a&gt; (1920\u201328) and chief conductor of the Latvian RSO and artistic director of Latvian Radio (1928\u201344). He also appeared as a guest conductor in &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tallinn\"&gt;Tallinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaunas\"&gt;Kaunas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;. He taught in the orchestration class at the Latvian State Conservatory (1921\u201344), where he was appointed professor in 1929; in 1932 he became head of orchestral conducting.\n1940s and after.\nBut this fruitful period came to a close in 1940 with the annexation of Latvia into the USSR \u2013 resulting in the deportation or execution of over 30,000 of the population \u2013 subsequent German invasion, and then a final Soviet annexation. J\u0101nis took his family abroad, spending time in &lt;a href=\"Rostock\"&gt;Rostock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BCbeck\"&gt;L\u00fcbeck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and then, from 1946, living in the Blomberg refugee camp in Germany with many other Latvians. Finally, in 1948, they settled in Stockholm. Here, although he did not enjoy the high-profile he had enjoyed at home, he remained active as a composer (as he had done in transit) and, during the last two decades of his life he produced a body of chamber works that includes &lt;a href=\"sonata\"&gt;sonata&lt;/a&gt;s for \u2018cello, violin, clarinet, flute and oboe with piano, as well as a Piano Quintet (1946), a Rhapsody for two pianos (1954) and a sonata for solo accordion (1955). In 1960 he received the Award for Exiled Latvians. Following Latvian independence, his opera \"Uguns un nakts\" reopened the restored &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20National%20Opera\"&gt;Latvian National Opera&lt;/a&gt; House in 1995."
