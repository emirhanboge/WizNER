During this time, he was also a member of the U17 and U18 &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;United States men's national soccer team&lt;/a&gt; where he played alongside &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Howard\"&gt;Tim Howard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Cherundolo\"&gt;Steve Cherundolo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Bocanegra\"&gt;Carlos Bocanegra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Albright\"&gt;Chris Albright&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorkus played for the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill\"&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt; from 1997-2000. In 2000, in the most exciting 13 seconds of college soccer, a play that involved a 50-yard pass, three headers and a volley, Caleb scored the golden goal to bring the Tar Heels the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; tournament title. Later in 2000, he played for the &lt;a href=\"Boulder%20Nova\"&gt;Boulder Nova&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20Development%20League\"&gt;Premier Development League&lt;/a&gt;.\nProfessional.\nNorkus was drafted by &lt;a href=\"D.C.%20United\"&gt;D.C. United&lt;/a&gt; in the fifth round of &lt;a href=\"2001%20MLS%20SuperDraft\"&gt;2001 MLS SuperDraft&lt;/a&gt;. Although he trained with the team, Caleb did not catch on with the MLS side and later signed with &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20Eagles\"&gt;Charlotte Eagles&lt;/a&gt; of the then &lt;a href=\"United%20Soccer%20Leagues\"&gt;United Soccer Leagues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A-League%20%28American%29\"&gt;A-League&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter two seasons with the Eagles, Norkus moved to &lt;a href=\"Sportfreunde%20Siegen\"&gt;Sportfreunde Siegen&lt;/a&gt; of the German &lt;a href=\"Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29\"&gt;Regionalliga-S\u00fcd&lt;/a&gt; (German 3rd Division). In 2004, Caleb returned to the United States with the &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20Kickers\"&gt;Richmond Kickers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"USL%20First%20Division\"&gt;USL First Division&lt;/a&gt; (at the time) but transferred midseason to &lt;a href=\"Charleston%20Battery\"&gt;Charleston Battery&lt;/a&gt; of the same league. At the end of that season, Norkus took an opportunity to play in the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Chile\"&gt;Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Chile&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Uni%C3%B3n%20Espa%C3%B1ola\"&gt;Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola&lt;/a&gt; and helped the team to the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Torneo%20Apertura%20%28Chile%29\"&gt;2005 Apertura&lt;/a&gt; title.\nAt the conclusion of the Chilean 2005 Apertura, Norkus moved to &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20Islanders\"&gt;Puerto Rico Islanders&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"USL-1\"&gt;USL-1&lt;/a&gt; for the remainder of the USL 2005 season. In 2006, Norkus season got off to a brilliant start as he scored 4 goals in the Islanders' first 10 games before being sidelined with a &lt;a href=\"sports%20hernia\"&gt;sports hernia&lt;/a&gt; injury. After off-season surgery in &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, Norkus returned to the States to sign with the expansion &lt;a href=\"Carolina%20RailHawks\"&gt;Carolina RailHawks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"USL-1\"&gt;USL-1&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout Norkus' career, he has continually struggled with a series of unfortunate injuries which have limited his playing time and tenure at many of the clubs he has played for professionally. However, in his 2007 season after having surgery to correct a groin injury his fitness was not an issue. He played for the RailHawks through the 2010 season, going on loan to the &lt;a href=\"Charleston%20Battery\"&gt;Charleston Battery&lt;/a&gt; for one game at the end of the season. The following season, he accepted a role as player-coach for the &lt;a href=\"Carolina%20RailHawks\"&gt;Carolina RailHawks&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorkus' coaching career began during his early years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he began leading sessions at both the men's and women's summer camps. Throughout his playing career, Norkus coached youth soccer in multiple settings, including Charlotte Christian Academy's men's varsity program in 2002 and the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Area%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;Capital Area Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;, beginning in 2006. In 2009, Norkus obtained his &lt;a href=\"US%20Soccer%20Federation\"&gt;US Soccer Federation&lt;/a&gt; (USSF) National B coaching license. After ending the 2010 season as a full-time player, Norkus became Community Outreach Liaison and Youth Soccer Ambassador for the &lt;a href=\"Carolina%20RailHawks\"&gt;Carolina RailHawks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Area%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;Capital Area Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;. He continued in this role until he relocated to Puerto Rico, joining the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20Islanders\"&gt;Puerto Rico Islanders&lt;/a&gt; as a player-coach for the remainder of their final season in 2012. He also held the title of Community Outreach &amp; Fan Development Manager for the team during this period.\nControversy.\nPuerto Rico Islanders President &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Guillemard-Noble\"&gt;Andy Guillemard-Noble&lt;/a&gt; accused the RailHawks of piracy in the signing of Norkus, who was out of contract with the Islanders after the 2006 season. While the club executive insists that the Islanders had a verbal agreement with Norkus to return to Puerto Rico for the 2007 season, the player refutes that accusation, saying the two sides never reached terms and cites the lack of an offered written contract as evidence of their lack of agreement.\nInternational.\nNorkus made two appearances for the United States at the &lt;a href=\"1995%20FIFA%20U-17%20World%20Championship\"&gt;1995 FIFA U-17 World Championship&lt;/a&gt;'s played at Atahualpa Stadium in Quito, Ecuador. As a member of the U-15, U-17, and U-19 National Teams, Norkus played in over 40 international games in the Caribbean and Europe. During the summer of 1997, he won the MVP Trophy at the Voreppe Tournament in Paris, France, and was subsequently invited to a try-out with Anderlecht of Belgium's Premier League."
