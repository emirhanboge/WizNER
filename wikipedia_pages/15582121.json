    "text": "Leidolf was a manufacturer of &lt;a href=\"optical\"&gt;optical&lt;/a&gt; equipment situated in &lt;a href=\"Wetzlar\"&gt;Wetzlar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded by Rudolf Leidolf in 1921, initially producing &lt;a href=\"lens%20%28optics%29\"&gt;lens&lt;/a&gt;es for &lt;a href=\"microscope\"&gt;microscope&lt;/a&gt;s. In 1948 camera production was started and in 1962 the factory ceased operations. Leidolf is in no way related to Leitz (the manufacturer of &lt;a href=\"Leica%20Camera\"&gt;Leica&lt;/a&gt;), even though Wetzlar has been the historical location for both companies."
