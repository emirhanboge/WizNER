    "text": "\"Drunk in Love\" is a song by American singer &lt;a href=\"Beyonc%C3%A9\"&gt;Beyonc\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; featuring her husband, American rapper &lt;a href=\"Jay-Z\"&gt;Jay-Z&lt;/a&gt;. The duo composed the song along with credited production and writing by &lt;a href=\"Detail%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Detail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dre%20Moon\"&gt;Andre Eric Proctor&lt;/a&gt;, Rasool Diaz, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Soko\"&gt;Brian Soko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Timbaland\"&gt;Timbaland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J-Roc\"&gt;J-Roc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boots%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Beyonc%C3%A9%20%28album%29\"&gt;self-titled fifth studio album&lt;/a&gt; (2013). &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Records\"&gt;Columbia Records&lt;/a&gt; released \"Drunk in Love\" as one of the two &lt;a href=\"lead%20single\"&gt;lead single&lt;/a&gt;s from \"Beyonc\u00e9\" on December 17, 2013. The song is dominated by &lt;a href=\"Trap%20music%20%28hip%20hop%29\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Beat%20%28music%29\"&gt;beats&lt;/a&gt; in chunks and &lt;a href=\"Bass%20instrument\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt;. Its lyrics, which depict &lt;a href=\"female%20sexuality\"&gt;female sexuality&lt;/a&gt;, are sung by Beyonc\u00e9 in a sensual and confident way.\nMany music critics called the song a follow-up to Beyonc\u00e9's and Jay-Z's song \"&lt;a href=\"Crazy%20in%20Love\"&gt;Crazy in Love&lt;/a&gt;\" (2003). \"Drunk in Love\" peaked at number two on the US &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; chart, spending eight weeks in the top ten. It also reached the top ten in France, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. At the &lt;a href=\"57th%20Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;57th Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt;, \"Drunk in Love\" won &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Song\"&gt;Best R&amp;B Song&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Performance\"&gt;Best R&amp;B Performance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe song's &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; was directed by &lt;a href=\"Hype%20Williams\"&gt;Hype Williams&lt;/a&gt; and shot in &lt;a href=\"black-and-white\"&gt;black-and-white&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Beach%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Golden Beach, Florida&lt;/a&gt; at a beach front &lt;a href=\"manse\"&gt;manse&lt;/a&gt;. The visual features scenes of the pair singing the song together. \"Drunk in Love\" was performed by Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z at the &lt;a href=\"56th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;56th Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt;. It was later added to the set lists of the second European leg of Beyonc\u00e9's &lt;a href=\"The%20Mrs.%20Carter%20Show%20World%20Tour\"&gt;The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 and the pair's joint &lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Run%20Tour%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20and%20Jay-Z%29\"&gt;On the Run Tour&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. Numerous remixes and cover versions of the song were made, most notably the official rework by rapper &lt;a href=\"Kanye%20West\"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt;. The music video won &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Collaboration\"&gt;Best Collaboration&lt;/a&gt; and was nominated for &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Video of the Year&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards\"&gt;2014 MTV Video Music Awards&lt;/a&gt;.\nConception and release.\n\"Drunk in Love\" was written by &lt;a href=\"Beyonc%C3%A9\"&gt;Beyonc\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detail%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Detail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jay-Z\"&gt;Jay-Z&lt;/a&gt; in end of 2012, who appears as the featured artist on the track. Production of the song was handled by &lt;a href=\"Boots%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt; and Beyonc\u00e9 as well as Detail. \"Drunk in Love\" was recorded at &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20City%20Studios\"&gt;Jungle City Studios&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Oven%20Studios\"&gt;Oven Studios&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Detail approached Beyonc\u00e9 with a &lt;a href=\"Beat%20%28music%29\"&gt;beat&lt;/a&gt; he had created called \"Drunk\" inspired by different situations from being affected by alcohol. Beyonc\u00e9 further helped in the production of the song, adding elements that Detail had missed. She and Jay-Z later &lt;a href=\"Freestyle%20rap\"&gt;free-styled&lt;/a&gt; their verses for the song and &lt;a href=\"Timbaland\"&gt;Timbaland&lt;/a&gt; contributed keyboards. &lt;a href=\"J-Roc%20%28record%20producer%29\"&gt;J-Roc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dre%20Moon\"&gt;Dre Moon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Soko\"&gt;Brian Soko&lt;/a&gt; and Rasool Ricardo Diaz contributed to the production of the song. Elaborating on the conception of the song, Beyonc\u00e9 said: \"We just kinda had a party. It was so great, because it wasn't about any ego, we weren't trying to make a hit record [...] we were just having fun...and I think you can hear that in the record.\"\nIn 2014, rapper &lt;a href=\"Future%20%28rapper%29\"&gt;Future&lt;/a&gt; claimed that he had previously recorded a &lt;a href=\"Demo%20%28music%29\"&gt;demo version&lt;/a&gt; of the song. He worked together with Detail who persuaded him to record vocals for the track as it would convince Beyonc\u00e9 more easily to record it. Several days later, Detail informed Future that Beyonc\u00e9 was in the studio recording \"Drunk in Love\". However, when the rapper was working on his second studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Honest%20%28Future%20album%29\"&gt;Honest&lt;/a&gt;\", he used the same melody of the demo version on a song called \"Good Morning\" as Beyonc\u00e9 hadn't released her version seven months since he was told that she worked on it. When Beyonc\u00e9 released her album, the track was scrapped from the track listing of \"Honest\" and Future was not mentioned in its credits.\n\"Drunk in Love\" was subsequently included on Beyonc\u00e9's self-titled fifth studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Beyonc%C3%A9%20%28album%29\"&gt;Beyonc\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\" (2013) which was released on &lt;a href=\"iTunes%20Store\"&gt;iTunes Store&lt;/a&gt; with no promotion having taken place beforehand. Following the album's release, \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that \"Drunk in Love\" would be sent to &lt;a href=\"Urban%20contemporary\"&gt;urban contemporary radio&lt;/a&gt; in the US exclusively. \"XO\" impacted CHR, &lt;a href=\"hot%20adult%20contemporary\"&gt;hot adult contemporary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rhythmic%20contemporary\"&gt;rhythmic contemporary&lt;/a&gt; radio in the US on December 16, 2013, as the first single from the album. \"Drunk in Love\" impacted urban contemporary radio stations on December 17, 2013, serving as one of the two &lt;a href=\"lead%20single\"&gt;lead single&lt;/a&gt;s from \"Beyonc\u00e9\". On March 24, 2014, \"Drunk in Love\" was added to British radio station &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%201\"&gt;BBC Radio 1&lt;/a&gt;'s C-List.\nComposition.\nMusically, the song consists of &lt;a href=\"Bass%20%28instrument%29\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt;, skittering &lt;a href=\"drum\"&gt;drum&lt;/a&gt;s, vague &lt;a href=\"synthesizer\"&gt;synthesizer&lt;/a&gt;s, scintillating &lt;a href=\"String%20instrument\"&gt;strings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finger%20snapping\"&gt;finger snaps&lt;/a&gt; and a substantial amount of &lt;a href=\"Trap%20music%20%28hip%20hop%29\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Beat%20%28music%29\"&gt;beats&lt;/a&gt;. Elements of &lt;a href=\"Hip%20hop%20music\"&gt;hip hop&lt;/a&gt; music are also present in \"Drunk in Love\". Written in the key of A major, the track contains a moderately slow &lt;a href=\"tempo\"&gt;tempo&lt;/a&gt; of 70 beats per minute, while also following a chord progression of Fm\u2014Bm\u2014E\u2014A. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's vocals range from D3 to E5. Many contemporary critics viewed \"Drunk in Love\" as a sequel or an extension to Beyonc\u00e9's own 2003 collaboration with Jay-Z, \"&lt;a href=\"Crazy%20in%20Love%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29\"&gt;Crazy in Love&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Jody%20Rosen\"&gt;Jody Rosen&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Vulture%20%28blog%29\"&gt;Vulture&lt;/a&gt; found trademark Timbaland synths in the song and further went on to describe its production as \"skittering, blaring\".\nKeeping in with the most prominent theme of \"Beyonc\u00e9\", \"Drunk in Love\" explores &lt;a href=\"female%20sexuality\"&gt;female sexuality&lt;/a&gt;. Its lyrics express \"unbridled lust\" and love-making with a wholly committed lover. As she sings about how much she likes sex with her partner, Beyonc\u00e9 uses several &lt;a href=\"double%20entendre\"&gt;double entendre&lt;/a&gt;s, including the line, \"grainin' on that wood\", where she is supposedly referencing a &lt;a href=\"surfboard\"&gt;surfboard&lt;/a&gt;. The singer displays much attitude through her vocal inflections that were described as \"sassy\" by critics. Her vocal performance in the song was described as conversational, half-sung half-rapped, \"talk-over-the-beat\" styled further conveying spontaneity and truth-telling. Her singing is further ornamented by &lt;a href=\"Double%20harmonic%20scale\"&gt;Arabic-scale&lt;/a&gt; vocal &lt;a href=\"arpeggio\"&gt;arpeggio&lt;/a&gt;s. Beyonc\u00e9's vocal performance in the song has been noted for containing a flow similar to rappers &lt;a href=\"Drake%20%28rapper%29\"&gt;Drake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2%20Chainz\"&gt;2 Chainz&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Verge\"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;\"s Trent Wolbe felt that the song featured &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Collective\"&gt;Animal Collective&lt;/a&gt;-esque vocal filtering.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20%28music%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt;, Beyonc\u00e9 sings about having drunken sex in the kitchen: \"We woke up in the kitchen saying / How the hell did this shit happen / Oh baby, drunk in love, we be all night / Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding off in that club\". The second &lt;a href=\"Song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29%23verse\"&gt;verse&lt;/a&gt; of the song is half-rapped by her. Jay-Z later appears to provide his rapped verse as he relates having aggressive sex to &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Tyson\"&gt;Mike Tyson&lt;/a&gt; who was convicted of &lt;a href=\"rape\"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt; in 1992. Tyson also bit off a piece of &lt;a href=\"Evander%20Holyfield\"&gt;Evander Holyfield&lt;/a&gt;'s ear during a &lt;a href=\"Evander%20Holyfield%20vs.%20Mike%20Tyson%20II\"&gt;boxing match&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 which Jay-Z references: \"Catch a charge I might / beat the box up like Mike / In '97 I bite.\" He then compares his relationship with Beyonc\u00e9 to that of &lt;a href=\"Ike%20Turner\"&gt;Ike Turner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Turner\"&gt;Tina Turner&lt;/a&gt;. He forgoes subtlety as he raps, \"Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol/ Slid the panties right to the side/ Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight... your breasteses is my breakfast\". Similarly to Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z sings about the places they have had sex in their house. During his lines, he raps about \"reppin' that Third\", a reference to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Ward%2C%20Houston\"&gt;Third Ward&lt;/a&gt; area located in Houston.\nIn 2014, &lt;a href=\"Romani%20people\"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt; folk singer &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B3nika%20Juh%C3%A1sz%20Miczura\"&gt;M\u00f3nika Juh\u00e1sz Miczura&lt;/a&gt; alleged Beyonc\u00e9, Jay Z and Timbaland had used &lt;a href=\"Sampling%20%28music%29\"&gt;samples&lt;/a&gt; of her singing \"Bajba, Bajba Pelem\" without compensating her. Mitsou was seeking unspecified damages and an end to distribution of the song. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2015, in a ruling that said that the song was a \"constitutionally protected work of art\" and the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Civil%20Rights%20Law\"&gt;New York Civil Rights Law&lt;/a&gt; did not apply to it.\nCritical reception.\nThe song garnered universal acclaim. Mikael Wood of the \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Times\"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that Beyonc\u00e9 \"trades terrifically raunchy come-ons with Jay Z [on 'Drunk in Love']; it's like an NC-17 sequel to their 2003 smash '&lt;a href=\"Crazy%20in%20Love%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29\"&gt;Crazy in Love&lt;/a&gt;'\". Rob Sheffield of \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" chose the \"sex song\" as the album's best one, commenting that it is a \"superb duet\". Jon Dolan from the same publication also chose it as the album's best further comparing it with \"Crazy in Love\" with \"100 percent more drunkenness\". Andrew Hampp of \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" called the track a \"potential smash\" as he praised its appeal to &lt;a href=\"Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; radio stations and its \"infectious, wailing of 'loooove' on the chorus\". He also commended Beyonc\u00e9's and Jay-Z's rapped verses. Andrew Barker from \"&lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote in his review of \"Beyonc\u00e9\", \"a radio-ready pop single [is] buried somewhere within the Jay Z feature 'Drunk In Love,' yet Beyonce and Boots embellish it with enough strange grace notes and recitatives to create a much stranger monster than one might expect\". &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Guerra\"&gt;Joey Guerra&lt;/a&gt; from the \"&lt;a href=\"Houston%20Chronicle\"&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\" stated that Beyonc\u00e9 was in \"a fluid swagger\" in \"Drunk in Love\".\nJody Rosen writing for Vulture described the song as an \"appealing\" record and one of the best collaborations between the duo throughout their careers. He concluded that \"Jay's rap is goofy but not embarrassing.\" Nick Catucci of \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\" termed Beyonc\u00e9's rap as \"truculent\" and noted that \"Drunk in Love\" is one of the few songs of the album that displays scale-busting. &lt;a href=\"Kitty%20Empire\"&gt;Kitty Empire&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Observer\"&gt;The Observer&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that \"Drunk in Love\" finds Beyonc\u00e9 \"rapping lasciviously and making eyes at her husband. It's about 100 times better than that description allows for.\" Julia Leconte from \"&lt;a href=\"Now%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt;\" praised the singer's \"perfect\" growling vocals. Chris Kelly of &lt;a href=\"Fact%20%28UK%20magazine%29\"&gt;FACT&lt;/a&gt; magazine dubbed the song as the \"requisite duet with Jay Z (whose Ike Turner-referencing verse caps off a year of cringeworthy efforts)\". Pitchfork Media's Carrie Battan felt that the lines in which Beyonc\u00e9 ad-libbed \"surfboard\" were \"some of the most infectious snippets of pop music in 2013\", elaborating \"the single word serving as both shorthand for woman-on-top and a neat summation of an entire era of trends in rap cadence\". &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Kot\"&gt;Greg Kot&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Tribune\"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;\" described the track as a \"frisky reverie\". Likewise, Evan Rytlewski of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20A.V.%20Club\"&gt;The A.V. Club&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote:\nThe D'Angelo-indebted grind session '&lt;a href=\"Rocket%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29\"&gt;Rocket&lt;/a&gt;' and frisky 'Drunk In Love' are similarly sexy, but they're not sexy like a glamour shot or a steamy video. They're sexy like an overeager, pre-shower quickie, or a hushed morning make-out session before the baby wakes up. These are the most unapologetically raunchy songs she's ever sung, and in many ways also the most romantic.\nPhilip Matusavage of &lt;a href=\"musicOMH\"&gt;musicOMH&lt;/a&gt; noted that though \"Drunk in Love\" does not have a &lt;a href=\"Refrain\"&gt;chorus&lt;/a&gt;, it absolutely manages to be \"thrilling\", further writing that it is \"packed with ideas and touches\" which listeners would understand after repeated listens. Anupa Mistry of \"&lt;a href=\"Spin%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt;\" considered the song to be one of \"Beyonc\u00e9\"s \"elbows-up boom-trap anthems... ready to soundtrack both dive-bar antics and bottle-service quasi-sophistication.\" Philip Cosores of \"&lt;a href=\"Paste%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Paste&lt;/a&gt;\" highlighted that the track was highly evocative but found its lyrics to be \"half-baked at best\". Ryan Dennehy of &lt;a href=\"AbsolutePunk\"&gt;AbsolutePunk&lt;/a&gt; wrote that \"unconditional love has to be reciprocated to explain Jay Z's odious verse on 'Drunk in Love'\". &lt;a href=\"Stereogum\"&gt;Stereogum&lt;/a&gt;'s Tom Breihan criticized Jay-Z's \"pretty bad\" verse in the song. &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Media%20Network\"&gt;Philadelphia Media Network&lt;/a&gt; writer Dan DeLuca panned \"Drunk in Love\" as \"Beyonc\u00e9\"s biggest \"misstep\" due to Jay-Z's contribution.\nAlthough being praised by media outlets, \"Drunk in Love\" sparked controversy for its lyrics referencing &lt;a href=\"domestic%20violence\"&gt;domestic violence&lt;/a&gt;. On the song, Jay-Z rapped the lyrics \"I'm Ike, Turner, turn up / Baby no I don't play / Now eat the cake, Anna Mae / I said eat the cake, Anna Mae\" which alludes to &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Turner\"&gt;Tina Turner&lt;/a&gt;'s abusive relationship with her former husband, &lt;a href=\"Ike%20Turner\"&gt;Ike Turner&lt;/a&gt;. The lyric specifically refers to a scene from Tina Turner's &lt;a href=\"What%27s%20Love%20Got%20to%20Do%20with%20It%20%28film%29\"&gt;biopic&lt;/a&gt; in which Ike forced Tina to eat cake by pushing a piece of cake in her face. That particular scene was fabricated, but the film is loosely based on Tina Turner's real-life experience with a volatile husband. \"Rolling Stone\"s Rob Sheffield described the reference as \"tasteless\" in his review of the song and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" writer Tshepo Mokoena called the song's lyrics \"disturbing\" and \"distasteful\". British radio station Bang Radio aired an edited version of the song excluding the lyrics.\nRecognition and awards.\nIn the annual &lt;a href=\"Pazz%20and%20Jop\"&gt;Pazz and Jop&lt;/a&gt; mass critics poll of the year's best in music in 2013, \"Drunk in Love\" was ranked at number 162. The following year, \"Drunk in Love\" was ranked at number 21 on the same critics' poll. In 2014, the writers of \"&lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20%28website%29\"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;\" placed the song at number 44 on their list of the 200 best songs of the decade so far, with editor Carrie Battan writing, \"Someday, it will be heard as a brilliant ruse, a masterpiece of pop theater, or as simply a masterpiece, period.\" \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" ranked \"Drunk in Love\" at number one on its year-end list of the best songs in 2014. The magazine's writers described it as a \"future-pop fantasy\" and \"the sexiest thing on the radio\", further praising the singers for making \"marriage sound ridiculously hot\". By the end of 2019, &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;the same magazine&lt;/a&gt; would list \"Drunk in Love\" as the 22nd best song of the 2010s, while \"&lt;a href=\"NME\"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt;\" would place it at number 59 on their decade-end countdown.\nThe song was nominated for Top R&amp;B Song at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Billboard%20Music%20Awards\"&gt;2014 \"Billboard\" Music Awards&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"BET%20Awards%202014\"&gt;2014 BET Awards&lt;/a&gt;, it won &lt;a href=\"BET%20Award%20for%20Best%20Collaboration\"&gt;Best Collaboration&lt;/a&gt; and was nominated for &lt;a href=\"BET%20Award%20for%20Viewer%27s%20Choice\"&gt;Viewer's Choice&lt;/a&gt;, losing to \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Luv%20This%20Shit\"&gt;I Luv This Shit&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"August%20Alsina\"&gt;August Alsina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trinidad%20James\"&gt;Trinidad James&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Soul%20Train%20Music%20Awards\"&gt;2014 Soul Train Music Awards&lt;/a&gt;, \"Drunk in Love\" was nominated in the category for Song of the Year. The track won two Grammy awards, in the categories for &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Performance\"&gt;Best R&amp;B Performance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Song\"&gt;Best R&amp;B Song&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"57th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;57th Annual Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt; in 2015.\nChart performance.\nIn the US, \"Drunk in Love\" debuted at number 48 on the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Airplay\"&gt;Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay&lt;/a&gt; chart dated December 28, 2013. It was also the greatest gainer, with a 3.4 million audience impressions across 46 reporters. For the week ending January 4, 2014, the song soared to number nine on the airplay chart and went on to debut at number two on the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs\"&gt;Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs&lt;/a&gt; chart, the singer's highest debut on that chart with 61,000 downloads and 23.3 million audience impressions.

It was directed by &lt;a href=\"Hype%20Williams\"&gt;Hype Williams&lt;/a&gt; and shot in &lt;a href=\"black-and-white\"&gt;black-and-white&lt;/a&gt;; the clip depicts Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z \"madly in love\". The black-and-white shoot was meant to reference the work of fashion photographer &lt;a href=\"Herb%20Ritts\"&gt;Herb Ritts&lt;/a&gt;. Talking about the video in an iTunes Radio session, Beyonc\u00e9 said, \"The shoot was extremely effortless and spontaneous and we completely captured the energy of the song.\" She also went on to say that it was the most organic shoot she had ever done and further added: \"I wanted to carry this idea of being in the moment and embracing mistakes and effortlessness into the video. I wish every video was like 'Drunk [in Love]'.\" The clip was first released on the &lt;a href=\"iTunes%20Store\"&gt;iTunes Store&lt;/a&gt; on the visual album itself on December 13, 2013, which contained a previously filmed music video for every song and was later uploaded to Beyonc\u00e9's &lt;a href=\"Vevo\"&gt;Vevo&lt;/a&gt; channel three days later, on December 16, 2013.\nThe visual is almost six and a half minutes long. As the video begins, waves are seen crashing on a night time beach. Nearly a minute later, Beyonc\u00e9 appears; she is strolling on a beach at night and she seemingly carries a massive trophy while an eerie music is playing in the background. Sporting a sheer negligee that reveals her bra and panties beneath, she twists her body in the sand. The singer also dances seductively against a backdrop of smoke and mouths the song's lyrics, staring at the camera. Beyonc\u00e9 is later joined by husband Jay-Z, who is wearing a T-shirt and a backwards baseball cap. He raps with his eyes down holding a glass with alcohol in his hand while Beyonc\u00e9 mouths the words behind him, smiling. The last seconds of the video show Beyonc\u00e9 dancing and it concludes with close-up shots of the singer's face.\nReception.\nOn a review of the clip, Kory Glow of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote, \"The video, as metaphorical as it is, perfectly captures the feeling of the track.\" A writer for DJ Booth described the video as an \"equally steamy cinematic accompaniment\" to the song. Carrie Battan of &lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20%28website%29\"&gt;\"Pitchfork\"&lt;/a&gt; commented that the video \"brings the #surfboard line into clear focus\". \"&lt;a href=\"Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt;\" writer Michelle Collins described the scene where the singer sings the line \"surfboard\" as hilarious. An editor writing for \"&lt;a href=\"Rap-Up\"&gt;Rap-Up&lt;/a&gt;\" commended the \"intoxicating visuals\". \"&lt;a href=\"USA%20Today\"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;\"s Elysa Gardner felt that the clip was \"sultry\" showing the pair \"romp and caress on a beach, recalling a night of connubial bliss that lasted into morning\" as the song's lyrics. Gerrick D. Kennedy from the \"Los Angeles Times\" interpreted the scenes showing the trophy as representing the singer as a \"trophy wife\". Joe Lynch of &lt;a href=\"Fuse%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;Fuse&lt;/a&gt; compared Beyonc\u00e9's dancing in the sand with &lt;a href=\"Madonna%20%28entertainer%29\"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt;'s visual for \"&lt;a href=\"Cherish%20%28Madonna%20song%29\"&gt;Cherish&lt;/a&gt;\" (1989). Brent DiCrescenzo of the magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time Out&lt;/a&gt;\" also felt that the video for \"Cherish\" strongly influenced the video for \"Drunk in Love\".\nJon Dolan from \"Rolling Stone\" described the video as the second most &lt;a href=\"NSFW\"&gt;NSFW&lt;/a&gt; from the whole album. An editor from the website &lt;a href=\"Consequence%20of%20Sound\"&gt;Consequence of Sound&lt;/a&gt; described Beyonc\u00e9's dancing as an &lt;a href=\"Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system\"&gt;R-rated&lt;/a&gt; version of &lt;a href=\"Bo%20Derek\"&gt;Bo Derek&lt;/a&gt;'s role in the film \"&lt;a href=\"10%20%28film%29\"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;\" (1978). In her review, \"&lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Star\"&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/a&gt;\"s Malene Arpe called the video \"porny\". &lt;a href=\"HitFix\"&gt;HitFix&lt;/a&gt; reviewer Whitney Phaneuf felt that Beyonc\u00e9 was looking in the camera with pure lust concluding that when Jay-Z appears later, \"it's clear that her gaze has been fixed on him\". Claire Lobenfeld from \"&lt;a href=\"Complex%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Complex&lt;/a&gt;\" felt that the pair \"get wet and wild\" in the video further elaborating, \"For an album that is rooted in love, marriage, and sex, unleashing a video featuring her and her husband frolicking euphorically on the beach is the best first taste.\" \"&lt;a href=\"Slate%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;\"s Forrest Wickman called the clip one of the simplest on the album and noted, \"It's not the album's peak, musically or visually, but unconstrained by heavy choreography... it legitimately looks like they're having fun.\" Maura Johnston of \"Spin\" placed the video at number 5 on the magazine's list of the best music videos in 2013 saying that it was a \"worthy addition\" to the collaborations between Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z.\nThe video was nominated in the categories for &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20Japan%20for%20Best%20Female%20Video\"&gt;Best Female Video&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20Japan%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Video\"&gt;Best R&amp;B Video&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards%20Japan\"&gt;2014 MTV Video Music Awards Japan&lt;/a&gt;. It was also nominated for &lt;a href=\"BET%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Video of the Year&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"BET%20Awards%202014\"&gt;2014 BET Awards&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"2014%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards\"&gt;2014 MTV Video Music Awards&lt;/a&gt; the video was nominated in the categories for &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Video of the Year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Collaboration\"&gt;Best Collaboration&lt;/a&gt;, eventually winning the latter. At the 2014 Soul Train Music Awards the clip was nominated in the category for Video of the Year.\nLive performances.\nOn January 26, 2014, the couple opened the &lt;a href=\"56th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;56th Annual Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, performing the song live together for the first time. The performance opened with Beyonc\u00e9 sporting wet-look hair in a leotard and a leather &lt;a href=\"basque%20%28clothing%29\"&gt;basque&lt;/a&gt;, sitting on a chair with her back to the audience. She continued seductively dancing cabaret-style, singing and gyrating on the dark stage surrounded by smoke. Jay-Z appeared to rap his verses dressed in a suit and bow tie. The sexually-charged performance ended with a kiss and the two walked off with their arms around each other. Beyonc\u00e9's chair dance received comparisons with scenes from the movie \"&lt;a href=\"Flashdance\"&gt;Flashdance&lt;/a&gt;\", the song's music video and the video for \"&lt;a href=\"Partition%20%28song%29\"&gt;Partition&lt;/a&gt;\"; &lt;a href=\"VH1\"&gt;VH1&lt;/a&gt;'s Emily Exton felt that it was one of the best chair dances of all time. The duet was described as \"scorching\" and \"chill inducing\" with many critics considering the performance to be a show highlight; Lily Harrison of &lt;a href=\"E%21\"&gt;E!&lt;/a&gt; added that the pair \"set the bar impossibly high\". A \"Rolling Stone\" editor felt it was \"near flawless\". Nadeska Alexis writing for MTV News noted that when the singer started singing the first verses of the song, \"you could almost taste the aroma of sex appeal in the air\". A negative review came from Beverly Beckham of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Boston%20Globe\"&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt;\" who felt that the pair failed to showcase love in the lyrics and performance.\nThe performance sparked criticisms from some parents on social media who believed the performance was \"provocative\" and \"inappropriate\" due to its risqu\u00e9 nature; Melissa Henson, a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Parents%20Television%20Council\"&gt;Parents Television Council&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement that the performance was \"suggestive\" before adding, \"We have seen pretty consistently enough inappropriate material [on awards shows lately], that a lot of parents have written these off.\" Contrastingly, writing for \"&lt;a href=\"ThinkProgress\"&gt;ThinkProgress&lt;/a&gt;\", Alyssa Rosenberg said of the controversy: \"This may not be the vision of marriage conservatives intended to try to promote [but] if marriage is a product that conservatives desperately want to sell, the smartest thing they could do right now is to hire Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z as a product spokescouple... they made marriage look fun, and sexy, and a source of mutual professional fulfillment.\" On public reaction to the sexual performance, Lavanya Ramanathan of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote: \"The Internet exploded, and it's not surprising. This is a couple who sat separately at awards ceremonies when they were dating several years ago.\" On February 1, 2014, the couple performed the song again during Jay Z's performance at the &lt;a href=\"DirecTv\"&gt;DirecTv&lt;/a&gt; pre-&lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XLVIII\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; party. Christopher R. Weingarten of \"Rolling Stone\" referred to the pair's chemistry as the highlight of the event and said the performance was \"smiles and hugs and laughs, with one of the most famous rappers in the world gladly playing hypeman\" in contrast to the Grammy performance. Nekesa Mumbi Moody writing for the &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; felt that it was the set's highlight. At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, 2014, Beyonc\u00e9 performed \"Drunk in Love\" live during a medley consisting of songs from her self-titled album. The performance featured the singer dressed in a bejeweled bodysuit and a singalong from the audience. She started the performance on a set of steps, with numerous dancers in headstands around her and went to the stage afterwards. Nadeska Alexis from MTV News commented that when the song opened, \"the crowd really started to lose their composure\". Writers of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" described the song's performance as \"booty-popping\".\nThe song was added to the set list and performed live during the second European leg of &lt;a href=\"The%20Mrs.%20Carter%20Show%20World%20Tour\"&gt;The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour&lt;/a&gt; in February and March 2014. For the performance, Beyonc\u00e9 danced on a chair in a &lt;a href=\"catsuit\"&gt;catsuit&lt;/a&gt; as kaleidoscope of lights illuminated her. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey felt that the track became a stadium sing-along like the other hits performed by the singer. Kitty Empire of \"The Observer\" wrote that the singer's ad libs made listeners feel like she \"got tipsy and had the hots for her husband\". Jay-Z joined her on stage to perform the song together at all six London shows of the leg, as well as at the final tour stop in Lisbon. A professionally recorded live performance of the song with Jay-Z from the tour aired on August 4, 2014, on \"Beyonce: X10\", an &lt;a href=\"HBO\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; series documenting renditions of the song performed during The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. Erin Strecker from \"Billboard\" felt that the choreography from the performance was \"instantly iconic\". Anna Silman of Variety praised the singer's different sparkling costumes and noted that overally, the rendition was \"as sultry and showstopping as you'd imagine\". \"Drunk in Love\" was part of the set list of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's co-headlining &lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Run%20Tour%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20and%20Jay-Z%29\"&gt;On the Run Tour&lt;/a&gt; (2014). For the performance of the song, Beyonc\u00e9 performed a chair dance and was accompanied by Jay-Z for his part which contained a short snippet of Kanye West's \"&lt;a href=\"On%20Sight\"&gt;On Sight&lt;/a&gt;\". While reviewing the opening concert of the tour, Rebecca Thomas writing for MTV News described the performance of the song as \"intoxicating\".\nRemixes.\nThe popularity of the song has led to several &lt;a href=\"remix\"&gt;remix&lt;/a&gt;es. In December 2013, American singer &lt;a href=\"Rico%20Love\"&gt;Rico Love&lt;/a&gt; and American rapper &lt;a href=\"Plies%20%28rapper%29\"&gt;Plies&lt;/a&gt; released a remix of \"Drunk in Love\" in which they sang about their sex experiences. On January 16, 2014, English musician &lt;a href=\"James%20Blake%20%28musician%29\"&gt;James Blake&lt;/a&gt; debuted a remix of the song on &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%201\"&gt;BBC Radio 1&lt;/a&gt; using his &lt;a href=\"alter%20ego\"&gt;alter ego&lt;/a&gt; Harmonimix considerably altering Beyonc\u00e9's voice. Future utilized &lt;a href=\"Auto-Tune\"&gt;Auto-Tune&lt;/a&gt; on his version of the song, which he released in late January 2014. At BBC Radio 1's &lt;a href=\"Live%20Lounge\"&gt;Live Lounge&lt;/a&gt;, American rapper &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Haze\"&gt;Angel Haze&lt;/a&gt; performed \"Drunk in Love\", substituting Jay Z's verses with new lines that discuss empowerment and &lt;a href=\"braggadocio%20%28rap%29\"&gt;braggadocio&lt;/a&gt;. She later released a studio version in April leaving some vocals by Beyonc\u00e9 from the original; this version was noted for containing more aggression than her live rendition.\nOn January 27, 2014, DJ &lt;a href=\"MeLo-X\"&gt;MeLo-X&lt;/a&gt; performed a remix with visuals at &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Kelly%20Gallery\"&gt;Sean Kelly Gallery&lt;/a&gt; in New York City. A video of the remix, titled \"Drunk in Lust\", was uploaded to YouTube as part of MeLo-X's five-song EP of unauthorized Beyonc\u00e9 remixes called \"Yonc\u00e9-X\". Beyonc\u00e9's label asked repeatedly for the remixes to be taken offline, but MeLo-X kept uploading them to new host sites. Eventually, Beyonc\u00e9 herself watched \"Drunk in Lust\", and invited MeLo-X to collaborate with Jay-Z on their &lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Run%20Tour%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20and%20Jay-Z%29\"&gt;On the Run Tour&lt;/a&gt;. This led to further collaborations on her \"&lt;a href=\"Lemonade%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20album%29\"&gt;Lemonade&lt;/a&gt;\" album and subsequent tour.\nOn February 13, 2014, &lt;a href=\"Detail%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Detail&lt;/a&gt; released a seven-minute version of the song on which he worked for three weeks. It was titled \"Drunken Love\" and it included unreleased audio elements from the recording of the original song from which several variables of it existed. Pitchfork Media's Carrie Battan described his version as \"chopped-up, stretched out, cathedral-ready\". On February 14, 2014, American rapper &lt;a href=\"Kanye%20West\"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt;, frequent collaborator of &lt;a href=\"Jay-Z\"&gt;Jay-Z&lt;/a&gt;, released the official remix of \"Drunk in Love\", featuring an explicit verse by himself and a slightly modified instrumental produced by &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Dean%20%28record%20producer%29\"&gt;Mike Dean&lt;/a&gt;. In his lines, West rapped about his wife &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Kardashian\"&gt;Kim Kardashian&lt;/a&gt; and referenced the video for his own song, \"&lt;a href=\"Bound%202\"&gt;Bound 2&lt;/a&gt;\" (2013). A day after the release of the remix, Beyonc\u00e9 uploaded a 30-second clip in which she played a cowgirl corralling horses as West's vocals played in the background. Miriam Coleman of \"Rolling Stone\" felt that West's rework was an \"even raunchier spin on the already-adult-themed song\". The remix version was later included on the track listing of the platinum edition of \"Beyonc\u00e9\", released on November 24, 2014. &lt;a href=\"Diplo\"&gt;Diplo&lt;/a&gt; produced an &lt;a href=\"Electronic%20dance%20music\"&gt;EDM&lt;/a&gt;-influenced remix of the song, which he released on February 15, 2014. Canadian singer &lt;a href=\"The%20Weeknd\"&gt;The Weeknd&lt;/a&gt; and American rapper &lt;a href=\"T.I.\"&gt;T.I.&lt;/a&gt; both released their respective remixes on the same date; the former's version featured lyrics about drug use and &lt;a href=\"corruption\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;. On February 18, 2014, American rapper &lt;a href=\"Cassidy%20%28rapper%29\"&gt;Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; released a song titled \"Surfboard\", with the tag \"Drunk in Love G-Mix\", which heavily samples \"Drunk in Love\". On December 18, 2014, &lt;a href=\"Ti%C3%ABsto\"&gt;Ti\u00ebsto&lt;/a&gt; released a remix of the song after playing it in DJ sets a few months earlier.\nCover versions.\nEnglish singer &lt;a href=\"Katy%20B\"&gt;Katy B&lt;/a&gt; performed a medley of \"Drunk in Love\" and &lt;a href=\"Tinashe\"&gt;Tinashe&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Vulnerable\" during &lt;a href=\"Rinse%20FM\"&gt;Rinse FM&lt;/a&gt; sessions at London's &lt;a href=\"Metropolis%20Group\"&gt;Metropolis Studios&lt;/a&gt; in late February 2014. &lt;a href=\"Sevyn%20Streeter\"&gt;Sevyn Streeter&lt;/a&gt; covered the song live during a concert in March. &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Sheeran\"&gt;Ed Sheeran&lt;/a&gt; also performed an acoustic cover version on the \"&lt;a href=\"Elvis%20Duran%20and%20the%20Morning%20Show\"&gt;Elvis Duran and the Morning Show&lt;/a&gt;\" broadcast on April 11 and on &lt;a href=\"4Music\"&gt;4Music&lt;/a&gt; on May 9, 2014. He had sung the beginning of the song for several seconds the month before during \"&lt;a href=\"On%20Air%20with%20Ryan%20Seacrest\"&gt;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&lt;/a&gt;\" and decided to fully cover it following fan demands. Alternative rock band &lt;a href=\"Grouplove\"&gt;Grouplove&lt;/a&gt; performed a rock-infused cover of the song at the 2014 &lt;a href=\"Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival\"&gt;Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival&lt;/a&gt;. The writers of \"Billboard\" magazine described it as \"earnest and uneven\". &lt;a href=\"Rita%20Ora\"&gt;Rita Ora&lt;/a&gt; covered \"Drunk in Love\" on May 25, 2014, during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Glasgow and on the French television show \"Le Before du Grand Journal\" the following day. In July 2014, &lt;a href=\"Sia%20Furler\"&gt;Sia&lt;/a&gt; performed a cover of the song along with Ed Sheeran and Grouplove on the second episode of VH1's SoundClash. During her performance at the &lt;a href=\"G-A-Y\"&gt;G-A-Y&lt;/a&gt; club in London in April 2014, British singer &lt;a href=\"Lily%20Allen\"&gt;Lily Allen&lt;/a&gt; appeared wearing a black bikini and a blond wig emulating Beyonc\u00e9's look from the song's video, lip-syncing the lyrics for a drag performance. She appeared on the stage with a trophy in her hand, getting spilled with water from a bucket and danced in a similar way to the singer. Several media outlets and fans on social media alike called it a \"mocking\" of Beyonc\u00e9 which Allen further denied on &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. For the album 'BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge 2014', singer Angel Haze recorded an acoustic cover of the song, including Jay Z's rap verses. The cover was highly praised by music critics. American rapper Liv included the \"surfboard\" line in her &lt;a href=\"diss%20track\"&gt;diss track&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Sorry%20Mrs.%20Carter\"&gt;Sorry Mrs. Carter&lt;/a&gt;\". Ariana Bacle of \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\" described the reference as \"a (disapproving) nod\" to the original song, while \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Beast\"&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt;\"s Amy Zimmerman praised Liv for criticizing the effectiveness of Beyonc\u00e9's analogy. The &lt;a href=\"mathcore\"&gt;mathcore&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Oceans%20Ate%20Alaska\"&gt;Oceans Ate Alaska&lt;/a&gt; covered \"Drunk in Love\" in 2014 for the compilation &lt;a href=\"Punk%20Goes%20Pop%20Vol.%206\"&gt;Punk Goes Pop Vol. 6&lt;/a&gt;.\nCredits and personnel.\nCredits adapted from Beyonc\u00e9's website.\nSong credits\nVideo credits"
