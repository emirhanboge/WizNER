However, in 482, Peroz sent an army under &lt;a href=\"Shapur%20Mihran\"&gt;Shapur Mihran&lt;/a&gt;, which defeated the Armenian rebels, killing Sahak. Vahan then fled to the mountains, while Shapur regained control of Armenia. Sahak had a son named &lt;a href=\"Spandiat\"&gt;Spandiat&lt;/a&gt;, who was given the title of aspet after his death.\nSources.\n "
