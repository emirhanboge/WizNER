    "text": "Pulp Sport was a New Zealand &lt;a href=\"television%20show\"&gt;television show&lt;/a&gt; that mixed &lt;a href=\"sport\"&gt;sport&lt;/a&gt; with various styles of &lt;a href=\"comedy\"&gt;comedy&lt;/a&gt;. The hosts &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Linehan\"&gt;Jamie Linehan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Boyce\"&gt;Ben Boyce&lt;/a&gt; acted under their respective &lt;a href=\"pseudonym\"&gt;pseudonym&lt;/a&gt;s Bill and Ben, performing a half-hour of various sports based &lt;a href=\"skits\"&gt;skits&lt;/a&gt;. They were usually accompanied by an anthropomorphic &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mascot\"&gt;mascot&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n\"Pulp Sport\" started as a radio show on &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Sport\"&gt;Radio Sport&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, and ran until the TV series began in 2003 on &lt;a href=\"SKY%20Network%20Television\"&gt;SKY Sport&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"broadcast%20syndication\"&gt;Syndication&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=\"C4%20%28television%20channel%29\"&gt;C4&lt;/a&gt; where it achieved strong ratings. As a result, it was soon acquired by &lt;a href=\"TV3%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;TV3&lt;/a&gt; where its popularity continued to grow with even better ratings. In 2006 and 2007, \"Pulp Sport\" was judged \"New Zealand's Best Comedy\" at the &lt;a href=\"Qantas%20Media%20Award\"&gt;Qantas New Zealand Television Awards&lt;/a&gt;. It was also a finalist in 2008 and again in 2010. In the 2009 TV Guide Best of the Box Awards, \"Pulp Sport\" was voted \"Funniest TV Show\" and Bill and Ben were voted \"Funniest Person on TV\".\nThe first series of \"Pulp Sport\" was made by Boyce and Linehan and their two mates using only one camera and edited on a borrowed computer in a kitchen flat. In the second series, they moved out to a garden shed.\nIn 2003, actor &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Laga%27aia\"&gt;Jay Laga'aia&lt;/a&gt; appeared in \"Pulp Sport\"s first ever episode. During the sketch he appeared in, Laga'aia injured his knee cap in two places, ending up in hospital for two days. This mishap delayed the filming of \"\", which Laga'aia was to act in later that month.\nIn 2004, while playing one of their regular pranks on New Zealand sports commentator Stephen McIvor, Bill and Ben hired a plane to fly the message \"McIvor blows goats\" over a &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Warriors\"&gt;New Zealand Warriors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"National%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;National Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; game at &lt;a href=\"Mt%20Smart%20Stadium\"&gt;Ericsson Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. McIvor and the New Zealand Police expressed their disgust over the message and consequently Linehan and Boyce received a police warning.\nLinehan and Boyce set up their own political party, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20and%20Ben%20Party\"&gt;Bill and Ben Party&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"joke%20political%20party\"&gt;joke political party&lt;/a&gt; based on their \"Pulp Sport\" personas. In the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20general%20election%2C%202008\"&gt;2008 New Zealand general election&lt;/a&gt;, they received 13,016 votes, approximately 0.56% of the total &lt;a href=\"Party-list%20proportional%20representation\"&gt;party vote&lt;/a&gt;, out-polling all minor parties in the election.\n&lt;a href=\"Network%20Ten\"&gt;Network Ten&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; syndicated the episodes on their sports channel &lt;a href=\"One%20%28Australian%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 and 2011. Three series of the show also played on &lt;a href=\"Fuel%20TV%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Fuel TV&lt;/a&gt; in Australia. Three of the series also went on to a limited run of &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBoyce went on to star in two series of his own show &lt;a href=\"WANNA-BEn\"&gt;WANNA-BEn&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 and then &lt;a href=\"Jono%20and%20Ben%20at%20Ten\"&gt;Jono and Ben at Ten&lt;/a&gt; in 2013.\nSegments.\nThe show featured recurring skit segments in each episode.\nActive in the final series.\nThe Mc Kay-ver segment has been seen in the shows successor &lt;a href=\"WANNA-BEn\"&gt;WANNA-BEn&lt;/a&gt; on at least 2 occasions.\nFootnotes.\nThis was actually true and confirmed by the medic."
