    "text": "Lake Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l is the largest fresh water &lt;a href=\"lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mongolia\"&gt;Mongolia&lt;/a&gt; by volume and second largest by area. It is located near the northern border of Mongolia, about 200 km (124 mi) west of the southern end of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Baikal\"&gt;Lake Baikal&lt;/a&gt;. It is nicknamed the \"Younger sister\" of those two \"sister lakes\".\nThe lake's name is also spelled Hovsgol, Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l, or Huvsgul in &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; texts. It is called \u0425\u04e9\u0432\u0441\u0433\u04e9\u043b \u043d\u0443\u0443\u0440 \"H\u00f6vsg\u00f6l n\u00far\" in Mongolian, and is also referred to as \u0425\u04e9\u0432\u0441\u0433\u04e9\u043b \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0439 \"H\u00f6vsg\u00f6l dalai\" (\"Ocean Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l\") or \"\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u044d\u044d\u0436\" \"Dalai \u00e9j\" (\"Ocean Mother\").\nGeography.\nLake Khuvsgul is located in the northwest of &lt;a href=\"Mongolia\"&gt;Mongolia&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Mongolia-Russia%20border\"&gt;Russian border&lt;/a&gt;, at the foot of the eastern &lt;a href=\"Sayan%20Mountains\"&gt;Sayan Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href=\"above%20mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;above sea level&lt;/a&gt;, long and deep. It is the second-most voluminous freshwater lake in Asia, and holds almost 70% of Mongolia's fresh water and 0.4% of all the fresh water in the world. The town of &lt;a href=\"Hatgal\"&gt;Hatgal&lt;/a&gt; lies at the southern end of the lake.\nLake Khuvsgul's &lt;a href=\"Drainage%20basin\"&gt;watershed&lt;/a&gt; is relatively small, and it has only small tributaries. It is drained at the southern end by the &lt;a href=\"Egiin%20Gol\"&gt;Egiin Gol&lt;/a&gt;, which connects to the &lt;a href=\"Selenga\"&gt;Selenge&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately flows into &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Baikal\"&gt;Lake Baikal&lt;/a&gt;. Between the two lakes, its waters travel more than , and fall , although the line-of-sight distance is only about . Its location in northern Mongolia forms one part of the southern border of the great Siberian &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt; forest, where the dominant tree is the Siberian larch (\"&lt;a href=\"Larix%20sibirica\"&gt;Larix sibirica&lt;/a&gt;\"),\nThe lake is surrounded by several mountain ranges. The highest mountain is the &lt;a href=\"Munku%20Sardyk\"&gt;B\u00fcrenkhaan / M\u00f6nkh Saridag&lt;/a&gt; (), whose peak, north of the lake, lies exactly on the &lt;a href=\"Russian-Mongolian%20border\"&gt;Russian-Mongolian border&lt;/a&gt;. The lake freezes over completely in winter, and the ice cover is strong enough to carry heavy trucks; transport routes on its surface offer shortcuts to the normal roads. However, this practice is now forbidden, to prevent pollution of the lake from both oil leaks and trucks breaking through the ice. An estimated 30-40 vehicles have broken through the ice into the lake over the years.\nThere is a roughly &lt;a href=\"ellipse\"&gt;elliptical&lt;/a&gt; island in the middle of the lake, named &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Boy%20Island\"&gt;Wooden Boy Island&lt;/a&gt;, measuring 3\u00a0km east-west and 2\u00a0km north-south. It is located about 11\u00a0km from the lake's eastern shore, and 50\u00a0km north of the town of &lt;a href=\"Hatgal\"&gt;Hatgal&lt;/a&gt;.\nEcological significance.\nKhuvsgul is one of seventeen &lt;a href=\"ancient%20lake\"&gt;ancient lake&lt;/a&gt;s in the world, being more than 2 million years old, and the most pristine (apart from &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Vostok\"&gt;Lake Vostok&lt;/a&gt;), as well as being the most significant drinking water reserve of Mongolia. Its water is potable without any treatment. Hovsgol is an ultra&lt;a href=\"oligotrophic\"&gt;oligotrophic&lt;/a&gt; lake with low levels of nutrients, primary productivity and high water clarity (&lt;a href=\"Secchi%20disk%23Secchi%20depth\"&gt;Secchi depth&lt;/a&gt;s &gt; 18 m are common). Hovsgol's fish community is species-poor compared to that of Lake Baikal. Species of commercial and recreational interest include Eurasian perch (\"&lt;a href=\"Perca%20fluviatilis\"&gt;Perca fluviatilis&lt;/a&gt;\"), burbot (\"&lt;a href=\"Lota%20lota\"&gt;Lota lota&lt;/a&gt;\"), lenok (\"&lt;a href=\"Brachymystax%20lenok\"&gt;Brachymystax lenok&lt;/a&gt;\"), and the endangered &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; Hovsgol grayling (\"&lt;a href=\"Thymallus\"&gt;Thymallus&lt;/a&gt; nigrescens\"). Though endangered by poaching during its spawning runs, the Hovsgol grayling is still abundant throughout much of the lake.\nThe Lake area is a National Park bigger than &lt;a href=\"Yellowstone%20National%20Park\"&gt;Yellowstone&lt;/a&gt; and strictly protected as a transition zone between Central Asian &lt;a href=\"Steppe\"&gt;Steppe&lt;/a&gt; and the Siberian &lt;a href=\"Taiga\"&gt;Taiga&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Hovsgol's protected status, illegal fishing is common and prohibitions against commercial fishing with gillnets are seldom enforced. The lake is traditionally considered sacred in a land suffering from arid conditions where most lakes are salty.\nThe Park is home to a variety of wildlife such as &lt;a href=\"ibex\"&gt;ibex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"argali\"&gt;argali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Deer\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wolverine\"&gt;wolverine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"musk%20deer\"&gt;musk deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"brown%20bear\"&gt;brown bear&lt;/a&gt;, Siberian &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sable\"&gt;sable&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe H\u00f6vsg\u00f6l (Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l) Long-term Ecological Research Site (LTERS) was established in 1997 and an extensive research program began soon thereafter. Now part of an international network of long-term study sites, the H\u00f6vsg\u00f6l LTERS provides a stage for nurturing Mongolia's scientific and environmental infrastructures, studying climate change, and developing sustainable responses to some of environmental challenges facing the lake and its watershed.\nRecent studies has identified high levels of &lt;a href=\"plastic%20pollution\"&gt;plastic pollution&lt;/a&gt; (esp. &lt;a href=\"microplastics\"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt;) in the lake, showing that even small rural populations can cause high plastics pollution levels, as high as elsewhere around the world.\nEtymology and transliterations.\nThe name \"Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l\" is derived from &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20languages\"&gt;Turkic&lt;/a&gt; words for \"Khob Su Kol, means Lake with Great water\" \"G\u00f6l\" is the Turkic and Mongolian word for \"lake.\" There are a number of different transcription variants, depending on whether the Cyrillic \"\u0445\" is transliterated to \"h\" or \"kh,\" or whether the \"\u04e9\" is transliterated to \"\u00f6,\" \"o,\" or \"u.\" Transcriptions from the name in the classical Mongolian script, like Hubsugul, Khubsugul etc. may also be seen."
