The company mines and handcrafts many of the products sold on its TV networks, hence its claim to cut out the \"&lt;a href=\"Reseller\"&gt;middleman&lt;/a&gt;\" and to attempt to undercut &lt;a href=\"high-street\"&gt;high-street&lt;/a&gt; prices.\nOn 14 January 2008, The Jewellery Channel moved from &lt;a href=\"Teddington%20Studios\"&gt;Teddington Studios&lt;/a&gt; to new purpose-built studios in Middlesex, simultaneously switching to widescreen-format broadcasting.\nOn 11 April 2008, The Jewellery Channel launched delivery to the Republic of Ireland for the first time.\nIn November 2019, The Jewellery Channel HD launched on Freeview and Virgin Media. It closed on the former service on 22 June 2020 to help make room for COM7 following the closure of COM8.\nIn May 2020, TJC formally changed their registered company name to 'Shop TJC Limited'. This was recorded at Companies House in the UK. The change was taken to reflect that the channel has broadened the products it sells into jewellery, lifestyle and homewares.\nIn June 2020, similar to &lt;a href=\"ITV%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt;'s broadcasting of &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20World\"&gt;Ideal World&lt;/a&gt; and Create and Craft, TJC began simulcasting live broadcasts on &lt;a href=\"More4\"&gt;More4&lt;/a&gt; during the channel's downtime hours.\nOn 15 March 2021, TJC HD launched on Sky, and then launched the following month on Freesat on 26 April.\nProduct offering.\nTJC sells a wide variety of gemstone jewellery, loose gemstones, watches, fashion jewellery and simulated gemstone pieces.

It also holds discount days where it reduces the final auction prices by 10% or 17.5% (the latter the equivalent to the &lt;a href=\"UK\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; 17.5% &lt;a href=\"VAT\"&gt;VAT&lt;/a&gt; charge).\nThe firm launched an additional channel, TJC Gold, in October 2012 to offer more expensive gold and platinum collections. It runs for six hours a day.\nWebsite.\nTJC's website offers their full catalogue of products (approximately 15,000 items), online rising auctions, on-air auction products and web offers not available on-air; TJC's channel can be watched from the website.

Consumers watching the channel live can text in and interact with the presenters.\nThe company offers a 30-day money back guarantee.\nRegulation.\nTJC has been censured by the Advertising Standards Authority the following times since 2007/8\nThe Jewellery Channel was fined \u00a33,200 by Trading Standards for making false claims about the treatment of a gemstone product sold through its TV channel. After complaints were made, the channel discovered that it had been selling jewellery described as natural 'pink topaz\u2019, when in fact it was colourless topaz sprayed pink.\nAuction date, 25 August 2013: The ASA received a complaint as to whether an auction starting price was misleading and exaggerated the item's value. Although the Jewellery Channel attributes no worth or value to the starting price, the ASA upheld the complaint on the grounds that, in this case, most viewers would infer that the opening figure represented a genuine valuation of the ring, and therefore the final reduced price was a genuine saving.\nPlatform availability.\n\"TJC\" is available on &lt;a href=\"Sky%20%28UK%20%26amp%3B%20Ireland%29\"&gt;Sky&lt;/a&gt; and FREEVIEW 24 hours a day.

The channel was replaced with a second &lt;a href=\"Gems%20TV\"&gt;Gems TV&lt;/a&gt; stream, which itself ceased in April 2009 as it was used for extended hours of &lt;a href=\"CNN%20International\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. On 21 September 2011, TJC returned to Freeview on channel 60. On 19 September 2012, TJC moved to Freeview channel 49 as part of a reshuffle of the EPG. On 4 November 2020, the channel moved to channel 50 as part of a move up where every channel from channel 24 to 54 on the platform moved up one place to allow &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Four\"&gt;BBC Four&lt;/a&gt; to move to channel 24 in Scotland due to new &lt;a href=\"Ofcom\"&gt;Ofcom&lt;/a&gt; rules regarding certain PSB channels requiring greater prominence on EPGs.\nTJC also &lt;a href=\"simulcast\"&gt;simulcast&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"5USA\"&gt;5USA&lt;/a&gt; between 6am and 12pm, allowing the channel to be available to viewers on &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Media\"&gt;Virgin Media&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"TalkTalk%20TV\"&gt;TalkTalk TV&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to Freesat, Freeview and Sky."
