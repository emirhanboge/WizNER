It was reborn on experiences and values from other scout and guide associations, especially by support of AGESCI (&lt;a href=\"Associazione%20Guide%20e%20Scout%20Cattolici%20Italiani\"&gt;Associazione Guide e Scout Cattolici Italiani&lt;/a&gt;) leaders from &lt;a href=\"Friuli-Venezia%20Giulia\"&gt;Friuli-Venezia Giulia&lt;/a&gt;, who helped much establishing the concept of the organizations activities (structure, education, programme).\nZSKSS is affiliated to the &lt;a href=\"Slovenska%20Zamejska%20Skavtska%20Organizacija\"&gt;Slovenska Zamejska Skavtska Organizacija&lt;/a&gt; (SZSO) serving Slovenian Scouts in &lt;a href=\"Friuli-Venezia%20Giulia\"&gt;Friuli-Venezia Giulia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, and also to the &lt;a href=\"Associazione%20Guide%20e%20Scouts%20Cattolici%20Italiani\"&gt;Associazione Guide e Scouts Cattolici Italiani&lt;/a&gt; (AGESCI).\nHistory.\nThe history of Scouting in Slovenia dates to the former &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1922, a meeting (slet) of &lt;a href=\"Sokol\"&gt;Sokol&lt;/a&gt;, an important &lt;a href=\"Pan-Slavism\"&gt;Pan-Slavic&lt;/a&gt; movement and sport organisation in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, took place in &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana\"&gt;Ljubljana&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;n Scouts also attended. Scouting was officially established in Slovenia in October 1922, and soon a large number of Scout groups in Slovenia contributed to the establishment of the common Scout Region (named \u017dupa) for &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, founded in &lt;a href=\"Osijek\"&gt;Osijek&lt;/a&gt;. The Slovenian own Scout Region was established in early 1923 at &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana\"&gt;Ljubljana&lt;/a&gt;. The first Slovene Scout and Guide camp was organized during the summer of 1923 at &lt;a href=\"Kamni%C5%A1ka%20Bistrica\"&gt;Kamni\u0161ka Bistrica&lt;/a&gt;. \nScouting in Slovenia was officially dissolved on June 10, 1941 because of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. Just prior to the dissolution, there were 1,380 members of the Slovene Scout Organization.\nSlovene Scout groups in exile, in Italy and Austria.\nSlovene Scouting continued after the war, in exile, at first at &lt;a href=\"refugee%20camp\"&gt;refugee camp&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Carinthia\"&gt;Carinthia&lt;/a&gt;, and afterwards in Slovene communities in &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, among the Slovenes living in &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Gorizia\"&gt;Gorizia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; and nearby. The Scouting was organized among the Slovene ethnic groups in neighboring countries: The Slovene Carinthian Scouts organisation (1957) in &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; (today part of the &lt;a href=\"Pfadfinder%20und%20Pfadfinderinnen%20%C3%96sterreichs\"&gt;Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen \u00d6sterreichs&lt;/a&gt;); the Slovene Scouts of Trieste (Slovenska Zamejska Skavtska Organizacija) (1951 at &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt;) for boys and in 1958 for girls; and the Slovene Scouts of &lt;a href=\"Gorizia\"&gt;Gorizia&lt;/a&gt; (SZSO - ) (1963) for girls and 1964 for boys as well.\nZSKSS establishment.\nIn 1984, a secondary school &lt;a href=\"student\"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; from Ljubljana, Peter Lov\u0161in, became acquainted with the Scout Movement. He decided to begin apolitical Scouting in &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana\"&gt;Ljubljana&lt;/a&gt;. In the summer of 1985 he went to camp with Scouts from &lt;a href=\"Gorizia\"&gt;Gorizia&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1986 he made the Scout Promise as one of their rank. In the same year he gathered a group of young people around him in one of the Catholic &lt;a href=\"parish\"&gt;parish&lt;/a&gt;es of Ljubljana, with assistance from Slovene Scouts from &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorizia\"&gt;Gorizia&lt;/a&gt;. The group was growing and in autumn 1988 was moved to another parish of Ljubljana. During the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20George\"&gt;Saint George&lt;/a&gt; feast of 1989, 12 boys and girls made the Scout Promise, and by 1990, there were 21 Girl Guides and 18 Boy Scouts. The Catholic Scout Movement began to spread all over &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;. On March 31, 1990, the (ZSKSS) was established. The first legal Scout Promises were made by 29 Girl Guides and Boy Scouts, in a suburb of Ljubljana on May 20 of that year. Officially the ZSKSS was registered on Sunday, October 22, 1992.\nInternational membership.\nIn 1996 ZSKSS was accepted as an associate member of &lt;a href=\"WAGGGS\"&gt;WAGGGS&lt;/a&gt;. ZSKSS received full membership in WAGGGS in 1999.\nFor individual members of ZSKSS, the &lt;a href=\"Zveza%20tabornikov%20Slovenije\"&gt;Zveza tabornikov Slovenije&lt;/a&gt;, the Slovenian &lt;a href=\"World%20Organization%20of%20the%20Scout%20Movement\"&gt;WOSM&lt;/a&gt; member, guarantees the right of personal WOSM-membership and to participate as well to the international scout events (like &lt;a href=\"Jamboree\"&gt;Jamboree&lt;/a&gt;'s) and educational activities.\nProgram and organisation.\nThe primary purpose of the Association is to contribute to the fully physical, mental, spiritual and social development of young people so that they could become people of strong character, responsible citizens and members of local, national and international communities.
