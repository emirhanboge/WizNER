    "text": "The Lillooet River is a major river of the southern &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Mountains\"&gt;Coast Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. It begins at Silt Lake, on the southern edge of the &lt;a href=\"Lillooet%20Icecap\"&gt;Lillooet Crown Icecap&lt;/a&gt; about 80 kilometres northwest of &lt;a href=\"Pemberton%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Pemberton&lt;/a&gt; and about 85 kilometres northwest of &lt;a href=\"Whistler%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Whistler&lt;/a&gt;. Its upper valley is about 95 kilometres in length, entering Lillooet Lake about 15\u00a0km downstream from &lt;a href=\"Pemberton%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Pemberton&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern outskirts of the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Currie%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Mount Currie&lt;/a&gt; reserve of the &lt;a href=\"Lil%27wat\"&gt;Lil'wat&lt;/a&gt; branch of the &lt;a href=\"St%27at%27imc\"&gt;St'at'imc&lt;/a&gt; people. From &lt;a href=\"Pemberton%20Meadows\"&gt;Pemberton Meadows&lt;/a&gt;, about 40\u00a0km upstream from Pemberton, to Lillooet Lake, the flat bottomlands of the river form the &lt;a href=\"Pemberton%20Valley\"&gt;Pemberton Valley&lt;/a&gt; farming region.\nBelow the 30\u00a0km (18.6\u00a0mi) length of &lt;a href=\"Lillooet%20Lake\"&gt;Lillooet Lake&lt;/a&gt;, it resumes again just north of the native community and ghost town of &lt;a href=\"Skookumchuck%20Hot%20Springs%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Skookumchuck Hot Springs&lt;/a&gt;, which is known in the St'at'imcets language as &lt;a href=\"Skatin%20First%20Nation\"&gt;Skatin&lt;/a&gt;. The lower stretch of the Lillooet River, from &lt;a href=\"Lillooet%20Lake\"&gt;Lillooet Lake&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Lake\"&gt;Harrison Lake&lt;/a&gt;, is approximately 55\u00a0km (c. 34\u00a0mi) in length. Its main tributaries are &lt;a href=\"Meager%20Creek\"&gt;Meager Creek&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20River\"&gt;Ryan River&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Green%20River%20%28British%20Columbia%29\"&gt;Green River&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Birkenhead%20River\"&gt;Birkenhead River&lt;/a&gt;. Below &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Lake\"&gt;Harrison Lake&lt;/a&gt;, the stream is renamed as the &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20River\"&gt;Harrison River&lt;/a&gt;, which enters the &lt;a href=\"Fraser%20River\"&gt;Fraser&lt;/a&gt; near the First Nations community of &lt;a href=\"Chehalis%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Chehalis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe lower Lillooet River and &lt;a href=\"Lillooet%20Lake\"&gt;Lillooet Lake&lt;/a&gt; were part of a short-lived main route between the Coast and the Interior in the days of the &lt;a href=\"Fraser%20Canyon%20Gold%20Rush\"&gt;Fraser Canyon Gold Rush&lt;/a&gt;. See the &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Road\"&gt;Douglas Road&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"other\" Lillooet River.\nUntil the 1910s, the name Lillooet River also applied to what is now the &lt;a href=\"Alouette%20River\"&gt;Alouette River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maple%20Ridge%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Maple Ridge&lt;/a&gt;; the neighbourhood that grew up on its south branch became known as South Lillooet, but to avoid confusion the new postmaster was requested to come up with a name, choosing &lt;a href=\"Yennadon\"&gt;Yennadon&lt;/a&gt; after his family manor on the &lt;a href=\"Devon\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt;shire Moors. The river name was changed formally on March 31, 1915 with \"Alouette\" chosen because of its resemblance to the sound of \"Lillooet\".\nGeology.\nThe Lillooet River was &lt;a href=\"dam\"&gt;dam&lt;/a&gt;med with &lt;a href=\"breccia\"&gt;breccia&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Plinian%20eruption\"&gt;Plinian&lt;/a&gt; style eruption of the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Meager%20massif\"&gt;Mount Meager massif&lt;/a&gt; 2,400 years ago. The breccia damming the Lillooet River was not very strong, and the water soon eroded the breccia that was damming the river, forming &lt;a href=\"Keyhole%20Falls\"&gt;Keyhole Falls&lt;/a&gt;. There was a massive &lt;a href=\"flood\"&gt;flood&lt;/a&gt; when the water first broke through the breccia. The flood was big enough that small &lt;a href=\"house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; sized blocks of breccia were carried away during the flood."
