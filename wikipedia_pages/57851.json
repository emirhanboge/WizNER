    "text": "Columbia is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20capitals%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina\"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. With a population of 136,632 as of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20U.S.%20Census\"&gt;2020 U.S. Census&lt;/a&gt;, it is &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20municipalities%20in%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;the second-largest city&lt;/a&gt; in South Carolina. The city serves as the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Richland%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Richland County&lt;/a&gt;, and a portion of the city extends into neighboring &lt;a href=\"Lexington%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Lexington County&lt;/a&gt;. It is the center of the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20metropolitan%20area%20%28South%20Carolina%29\"&gt;Columbia metropolitan statistical area&lt;/a&gt;, which had a population of 829,470 and is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20metropolitan%20statistical%20areas\"&gt;72nd-largest metropolitan statistical area&lt;/a&gt; in the nation. The name &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20%28name%29\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt; is a poetic term used for the United States, derived from the name of &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Columbus\"&gt;Christopher Columbus&lt;/a&gt;, who explored for the Spanish Crown. Columbia is often abbreviated as Cola, leading to its nickname as \"Soda City.\"\nThe city is located about northwest of the geographic center of South Carolina, and is the primary city of the &lt;a href=\"Midlands%20%28South%20Carolina%29\"&gt;Midlands&lt;/a&gt; region of the state. It lies at the confluence of the &lt;a href=\"Saluda%20River\"&gt;Saluda River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Broad%20River%20%28Carolinas%29\"&gt;Broad River&lt;/a&gt;, which merge at Columbia to form the &lt;a href=\"Congaree%20River\"&gt;Congaree River&lt;/a&gt;. As the state capital, Columbia is the site of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina%20State%20House\"&gt;South Carolina State House&lt;/a&gt;, the center of government for the state. In 1860, the South Carolina Secession Convention took place here; delegates voted for secession, making this the first state to leave the &lt;a href=\"Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; in the events leading up to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. The first six states to secede were those whose planters held the most enslaved African Americans; these were slave societies.\nColumbia is home to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;University of South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, the state's flagship public university and the largest in the state. The area has benefited from Congressional support for Southern military installations. Columbia is the site of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Jackson%20%28South%20Carolina%29\"&gt;Fort Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, the largest &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; installation for &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Basic%20Training\"&gt;Basic Combat Training&lt;/a&gt;. Twenty miles to the east of the city is &lt;a href=\"McEntire%20Joint%20National%20Guard%20Base\"&gt;McEntire Joint National Guard Base&lt;/a&gt;, which is operated by the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Air%20Force\"&gt;U.S. Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and is used as a training base for the &lt;a href=\"169th%20Fighter%20Wing\"&gt;169th Fighter Wing&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina%20Air%20National%20Guard\"&gt;South Carolina Air National Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn May 1540, a Spanish expedition led by &lt;a href=\"Hernando%20de%20Soto\"&gt;Hernando de Soto&lt;/a&gt; traversed what is now Columbia while moving northward on exploration of the interior of the Southeast. The expedition produced the earliest written historical records of this area, which was part of the regional &lt;a href=\"Cofitachequi\"&gt;Cofitachequi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chiefdom\"&gt;chiefdom&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippian%20culture\"&gt;Mississippian culture&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;colonial era&lt;/a&gt;, European settlers encountered the Congaree in this area, who inhabited several villages along the Congaree River. The settlers established a frontier fort and fur trading post named after the Congaree, on the west bank of the Congaree River. It was at the fall line and the head of navigation in the &lt;a href=\"Santee%20River\"&gt;Santee River&lt;/a&gt; system.\nIn 1754 the &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20government%20in%20the%20Thirteen%20Colonies\"&gt;colonial government&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; established a ferry to connect the fort with the growing European settlements on the higher ground on the east bank.\nLike many other significant early settlements in colonial America, Columbia is on the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Seaboard%20fall%20line\"&gt;fall line&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Piedmont%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Piedmont&lt;/a&gt; region. The &lt;a href=\"fall%20line\"&gt;fall line&lt;/a&gt; is often marked by rapids at the places where the river cuts sharply down to lower levels in the Tidewater or Low Country of the coastal plain. Beyond the fall line, the river is unnavigable for boats sailing upstream. Entrepreneurs and later industrialists established mills in such areas, as the water flowing downriver, often over falls, provided power to run equipment.\nDesignation as state capital.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;American Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt; and United States independence, State Senator &lt;a href=\"John%20Lewis%20Gervais\"&gt;John Lewis Gervais&lt;/a&gt; of the town of &lt;a href=\"Ninety%20Six%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Ninety Six&lt;/a&gt; introduced a bill that was approved by the legislature on March 22, 1786, to create a new state capital. Considerable argument occurred over the name for the new city. According to published accounts, Senator Gervais said he hoped that \"in this town we should find refuge under the wings of &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20%28name%29\"&gt;COLUMBIA&lt;/a&gt;\", for that was the name which he wished it to be called. One legislator insisted on the name \"Washington\", but \"Columbia\" won by a vote of 11\u20137 in the state senate.\nThe site was chosen as the new state capital in 1786 due to its central location in the state. The State Legislature first met there in 1790. After remaining under the direct government of the legislature for the first two decades of its existence, Columbia was incorporated as a village in 1805 and then as a city in 1854.\nColumbia received a large stimulus to development when it was connected in a direct water route to &lt;a href=\"Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Charleston&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Santee%20Canal\"&gt;Santee Canal&lt;/a&gt;. This connected the Santee and Cooper rivers in a section. It was first chartered in 1786 and completed in 1800, making it one of the earliest canals in the United States. With competition later from faster railroad traffic, it ceased operation around 1850.\nThe commissioners designed a town of 400 blocks in a square along the river. The blocks were divided into lots of and sold to speculators and prospective residents. Buyers had to build a house at least long and wide within three years, or face an annual 5% penalty. The perimeter streets and two through streets were wide. The remaining squares were divided by thoroughfares wide. As the capital and one of the first &lt;a href=\"planned%20community\"&gt;planned cities&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, Columbia began to grow rapidly. Its population was nearing 1,000 shortly after the start of the 19th century.\nThe commissioners constituted the local government until 1797, when a Commission of Streets and Markets was created by the General Assembly. Three main issues occupied most of their time: public drunkenness, gambling, and poor sanitation.\n19th century.\nIn 1801, South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) was founded in Columbia. The original building survives. The city was chosen as the site of the state college in an effort to unite residents of the &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Upcountry&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina%20Lowcountry\"&gt;Lowcountry&lt;/a&gt; and to discourage elite youth from traveling to England for their higher education. At the time, South Carolina planter families sent more young men to England than did men of any other state. The leaders of South Carolina kept a close eye on the new college: for many years after its founding, commencement exercises were held in December while the state legislature was in session.\nColumbia received its first charter as a town in 1805. An intendant and six wardens governed the town. &lt;a href=\"John%20Taylor%20%28South%20Carolina%20governor%29\"&gt;John Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, the first elected intendant, later served in both houses of the General Assembly, both houses of Congress, and eventually was elected as governor. By 1816, some 250 homes had been built in the town and a population was more than 1000.\nColumbia became chartered as a city in 1854, with an elected mayor and six aldermen. Two years later, Columbia had a police force consisting of a full-time chief and nine patrolmen. The city continued to grow at a rapid pace, and throughout the 1850s and 1860s, Columbia was the largest inland city in the Carolinas. Railroad transportation served as a significant cause of population expansion in Columbia during this time. Rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s primarily transported cotton bales, not passengers, from there to major markets and the port of Charlestown. Cotton was the chief commodity of the state and lifeblood of the Columbia community; in 1850, virtually all of the city's commercial and economic activity was related to cotton. Cotton was sent to New York and New England's textile mills, as well as to England and Europe, where demand was high.\n\"In 1830, around 1,500 &lt;a href=\"slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; lived and worked in Columbia; this population grew to 3,300 by 1860. Some members of this large enslaved population worked in their masters' households. Masters also frequently hired out slaves to Columbia residents and institutions, including South Carolina College. Hired-out slaves sometimes returned to their owners' homes daily; others boarded with their temporary masters.\" During this period, \n\"legislators developed state and local statutes to restrict the movement of urban slaves in hopes of preventing rebellion. Although various decrees established &lt;a href=\"curfew\"&gt;curfew&lt;/a&gt;s and prohibited slaves from meeting and from learning to read and write, such rulings were difficult to enforce.\" \"[S]everal prewar accounts note that many Columbia slaves were literate; some slaves even conducted classes to teach others to read and write.\" Also, \"many slaves attended services at local Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist churches, yet some struggled to obtain membership in these institutions.\"\nColumbia's &lt;a href=\"First%20Baptist%20Church%20%28Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina%29\"&gt;First Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt; hosted the South Carolina Secession Convention on December 17, 1860. The white delegates drafted a resolution in favor of &lt;a href=\"secession\"&gt;secession&lt;/a&gt;, 159\u20130. Columbia's location made it an ideal location for other conventions and meetings within &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;the Confederacy&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn February 17, 1865, in the last months of the Civil War, much of Columbia was &lt;a href=\"Capture%20of%20Columbia\"&gt;destroyed by fire&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; troops under the command of General &lt;a href=\"William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman\"&gt;William Tecumseh Sherman&lt;/a&gt; approached. Jeff Goodwyn, mayor of Columbia, sent William B. Stanley and Thomas W. Radcliffe to surrender the city to Sherman's troops. According to legend, the First Baptist Church was nearly torched by Sherman's troops. The soldiers marched up to the church and asked the sexton if he could direct them to the First Baptist Church. The sexton directed the men to the nearby Washington Street Methodist Church. First Baptist was saved at the expense of another historic church.\nThe controversy surrounding the burning of the city started soon after the war ended. General Sherman blamed the high winds and retreating Confederate soldiers for firing bales of cotton, which had been stacked in the streets. Sherman denied ordering the burning, though he did order destruction of militarily significant structures, such as the &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20Printing%20Plant\"&gt;Confederate Printing Plant&lt;/a&gt;. Today, tourists can follow the path General Sherman's army took to enter the city and see structures or remnants of structures that survived the fire.\nDuring the Reconstruction era, when African-American Republicans were among the legislators elected to state government, Columbia became the focus of considerable attention. Reporters, journalists, travelers, and tourists flocked here to see a Southern state legislature whose members included freedmen (former slaves), as well as &lt;a href=\"people%20of%20color\"&gt;men of color&lt;/a&gt; who had been free before the war. The city began to rebuild and recover from the devastating fire of 1865; a mild construction boom took place within the first few years of Reconstruction. In addition, repair of railroad tracks in outlying areas created more jobs for residents.\nBy the late nineteenth century, culture was expanding in the city. In 1897 the Columbia Music Festival Association was founded by Mayor William McB. Sloan and the city aldermen. It was headquartered in the Opera House on Main Street, which also served as City Hall. Its role was to book and manage concerts and events in the opera house for the city.\n20th century.\nDuring the early 20th century, Columbia developed as a regional textile manufacturing center. In 1907, Columbia had six mills in operation: &lt;a href=\"Richland%20Cotton%20Mill\"&gt;Richland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Granby%20Mill%20Village%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Granby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Olympia%20Mill\"&gt;Olympia&lt;/a&gt;, Capital City, Columbia, and Palmetto. Combined, they employed over 3,400 workers with an annual payroll of $819,000, giving the Midlands an economic boost of over $4.8 million. Columbia had no paved streets until 1908, when 17 blocks of Main Street were surfaced. But, it had 115 publicly maintained street crossings, boardwalks placed at intersections to keep pedestrians from having to wade through a sea of mud between wooden sidewalks. As an experiment, Washington Street was once paved with wooden blocks. This proved to be the source of much local amusement when they buckled and floated away during heavy rains. The blocks were replaced with asphalt paving in 1925.\nDuring the years 1911 and 1912, some $2.5 million worth of construction occurred in the city, as investors used revenues generated by the mills. New projects included construction of the Union Bank Building at Main and Gervais, the &lt;a href=\"Palmetto%20Building\"&gt;Palmetto National Bank&lt;/a&gt;, a shopping arcade, and large hotels at Main and Laurel (the Jefferson) and at Main and Wheat (the Gresham). In 1917, the city was selected by the US Army to be developed as the site of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Jackson%20%28South%20Carolina%29\"&gt;Camp Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, a U.S. military installation that was officially classified as a \"Field Artillery Replacement Depot\". The first recruits arrived at the camp on September 1, 1917. In the first several decades of the 20th century, white Democrats of the &lt;a href=\"Solid%20South\"&gt;Solid South&lt;/a&gt; controlled an outsize amount of power in the House and Senate. The former Confederate states had effectively &lt;a href=\"Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era\"&gt;disenfranchised&lt;/a&gt; most blacks and many poor whites through passage of discriminatory laws and constitutions that made voter registration and voting more difficult. But they controlled all the seats in Congress related to the total state populations.\nIn 1930, Columbia was the hub of a trading area with about 500,000 potential customers. It had 803 retail establishments, 280 of them being food stores. The city also had 58 clothing and apparel outlets, 57 restaurants and lunch rooms, 55 filling stations, 38 pharmacies, 20 furniture stores, 19 auto dealers, 11 shoe stores, nine cigar stands, five department stores, and one book store. Wholesale distributors located within the city numbered 119, with one-third of them dealing in food.\nIn 1934, the federal courthouse at the corner of Main and Laurel streets was purchased by the city for use as City Hall. Built of granite from nearby &lt;a href=\"Winnsboro%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Winnsboro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20City%20Hall%20%28South%20Carolina%29\"&gt;Columbia City Hall&lt;/a&gt; is listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;. Designed by &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20B.%20Mullett\"&gt;Alfred Bult Mullett&lt;/a&gt;, President &lt;a href=\"Ulysses%20S.%20Grant\"&gt;Ulysses S. Grant&lt;/a&gt;'s federal architect, the building was completed in 1876. Mullet, best known for his design of the &lt;a href=\"Eisenhower%20Executive%20Office%20Building\"&gt;Executive Office Building&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, DC, had originally designed the courthouse with a clock tower. It was not constructed, perhaps because of large cost overruns on the project. Copies of Millet's original drawings can be seen on the walls of City Hall alongside historic photos of other Columbia beginnings. Federal offices were moved to the new &lt;a href=\"J.%20Bratton%20Davis%20United%20States%20Bankruptcy%20Courthouse\"&gt;J. Bratton Davis United States Bankruptcy Courthouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1940 Camp Jackson was reactivated after war started in Europe, and was designated as Fort Jackson. City leaders and the congressional delegation had lobbied to gain such a permanent military installation. In the early 1940s, shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;attack on Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, which catalyzed the entry of the US into &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Lt. Colonel &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Doolittle\"&gt;Jimmy Doolittle&lt;/a&gt; and his group of now-famous pilots began training for the 1942 &lt;a href=\"Doolittle%20Raid\"&gt;Doolittle Raid&lt;/a&gt; over Tokyo at what is now &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Metropolitan%20Airport\"&gt;Columbia Metropolitan Airport&lt;/a&gt;. They trained in &lt;a href=\"B-25%20Mitchell\"&gt;B-25 Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; bombers, the same model as the plane that is installed at Columbia's &lt;a href=\"Owens%20Field\"&gt;Owens Field&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Curtiss-Wright\"&gt;Curtiss-Wright&lt;/a&gt; hangar.\nDuring the 1940s African Americans increased activism for their civil rights: seeking to reverse &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Crow%20laws\"&gt;Jim Crow laws&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"racism\"&gt;racial discrimination&lt;/a&gt; that pushed them into second-class status in Columbia and the state. In 1945, a federal judge ruled that the city's black teachers were entitled to equal pay to that of their white counterparts. But, in following years, the state attempted to strip many blacks of their teaching credentials. Other issues in which the blacks of the city sought equality concerned &lt;a href=\"suffrage\"&gt;voting rights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"racial%20segregation\"&gt;segregation&lt;/a&gt; (particularly regarding public schools). In 1954, in \"&lt;a href=\"Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education\"&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/a&gt;\", the US Supreme Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional.\nOn August 21, 1962, eight downtown chain stores served blacks at their lunch counters for the first time. The University of South Carolina, a public institution, admitted its first black students in 1963. Around that same time, many vestiges of segregation began to disappear from the city: blacks attained membership on various municipal boards and commissions, and the city adopted a non-discriminatory hiring policy. These and other such signs of racial progress helped earn the city the 1964 &lt;a href=\"All-America%20City%20Award\"&gt;All-America City Award&lt;/a&gt; for the second time (the first being in 1951). A 1965 article in \"&lt;a href=\"Newsweek\"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;\" lauded Columbia as a city that had \"liberated itself from the plague of doctrinal &lt;a href=\"apartheid\"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSince the late 20th century, historic preservation has played a significant part in the city. The historic &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Mills%20House\"&gt;Robert Mills House&lt;/a&gt; was restored in 1967, which inspired the renovation and restoration of other historic structures, such as the &lt;a href=\"Hampton-Preston%20House\"&gt;Hampton-Preston House&lt;/a&gt; and others associated with President &lt;a href=\"Woodrow%20Wilson\"&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maxcy%20Gregg\"&gt;Maxcy Gregg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Boykin%20Chesnut\"&gt;Mary Boykin Chesnut&lt;/a&gt;, and noted free black Celia Mann. In the early 1970s, the University of South Carolina initiated the refurbishment of its \"Horseshoe\". Several area museums also benefited from the increased historical interest of that time, among them the Fort Jackson Museum, the McKissick Museum on the campus of the University of South Carolina, and most notably the &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina%20State%20Museum\"&gt;South Carolina State Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which opened in 1988.\nMayor Kirkman Finlay, Jr., was the driving force behind the refurbishment of Seaboard Park, now known as &lt;a href=\"Finlay%20Park\"&gt;Finlay Park&lt;/a&gt;, in the historic Congaree Vista district. His administration developed the $60 million Palmetto Center package, which resulted in construction of an office tower, parking garage, and the Columbia Marriott hotel, which opened in 1983. In 1980, the Columbia metropolitan population reached 410,088, and in 1990, this figure had hit roughly 470,000. During the 1970s and 1980s skyscrapers were constructed and other real-estate development took place throughout Columbia. To meet demand of businesses, the city constructed The &lt;a href=\"Tower%20at%201301%20Gervais\"&gt;Tower at 1301 Gervais&lt;/a&gt; in 1973. In 1983, Hub at Columbia was constructed. In 1987, the &lt;a href=\"Capitol%20Center%20%28Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina%29\"&gt;Capitol Center&lt;/a&gt; was built, which became the tallest building in South Carolina. The &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20America\"&gt;Bank of America&lt;/a&gt; Plaza was built in 1989.\nRecent history.\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s the city worked to revitalize the downtown, as businesses had been pulled out to the suburbs. The &lt;a href=\"Congaree%20Vista\"&gt;Congaree Vista&lt;/a&gt; district along Gervais Street, once known as a warehouse district, became an area of art galleries, shops, and restaurants. The &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Life%20Arena\"&gt;Colonial Life Arena&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as the Colonial Center) opened in 2002, and brought several major entertainers and shows to Columbia. &lt;a href=\"EdVenture\"&gt;EdVenture&lt;/a&gt;, the largest children's museum in the Southeast, opened in 2003. The &lt;a href=\"Village%20at%20Sandhill\"&gt;Village at Sandhill&lt;/a&gt; shopping center opened in 2004 in Northeast Richland County.\nThe Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center opened in 2004, and a new convention center hotel opened in September 2007. A public-private City Center Partnership has been formed to implement the downtown revitalization and boost downtown growth. In 2009, Columbia's most recent skyscraper, the Tower at Main and Gervais, was completed. Mayor &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20K.%20Benjamin\"&gt;Stephen K. Benjamin&lt;/a&gt; started his first term in July 2010, elected as the first African-American mayor in the city's history.\n&lt;a href=\"Founders%20Park\"&gt;Founders Park&lt;/a&gt;, home of USC baseball, opened in 2009. The South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team won two NCAA national championships in 2010 and in 2011. The &lt;a href=\"2010%20South%20Carolina%20Gamecocks%20football\"&gt;2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football&lt;/a&gt; team, under coach &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Spurrier\"&gt;Steve Spurrier&lt;/a&gt;, earned their first appearance in the SEC championship. Historic flooding in the city in October 2015 forced the Gamecocks football team to move their October 10 home game. &lt;a href=\"Segra%20Park\"&gt;Segra Park&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Spirit Communications Park), home of the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Fireflies\"&gt;Columbia Fireflies&lt;/a&gt;, opened in April 2016. In 2017, the Gamecocks women's basketball team (under coach &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Staley\"&gt;Dawn Staley&lt;/a&gt;) won their first NCAA championship, and the men's basketball team went to the Final Four for the first time.\nA &lt;a href=\"Mast%20General%20Store\"&gt;Mast General Store&lt;/a&gt; was opened in 2011. The &lt;a href=\"Music%20Farm%20%28music%20venue%29\"&gt;Music Farm&lt;/a&gt; opened a location in Columbia on Senate Street in 2014. In 2000, the Confederate battle flag was moved from the South Carolina State House to the Confederate monument. On July 10, 2015, the flag was removed from the monument to a museum. In 2017, the central path of a &lt;a href=\"Solar%20eclipse%20of%20August%2021%2C%202017\"&gt;total solar eclipse&lt;/a&gt; passed directly over the city and state capitol.\nGeography.\nOne of Columbia's more prominent geographical features is the fall line, the boundary between the upland &lt;a href=\"Piedmont%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Piedmont region&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coastal%20Plain\"&gt;Atlantic Coastal Plain&lt;/a&gt;, across which rivers drop as falls or rapids. Columbia developed at the fall line of the Congaree River, which is formed by the confluence of the Broad and Saluda rivers. The Congaree was the farthest inland point of river navigation. The energy of falling water also powered Columbia's early &lt;a href=\"Cotton%20mill\"&gt;mills&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city has capitalized on this location, which includes three rivers, by identifying as \"The Columbia Riverbanks Region\". Columbia is located roughly halfway between the Atlantic Ocean and the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Ridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blue Ridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, at an elevation around .\nSoils in Columbia are well drained in most cases, with grayish brown loamy sand topsoil. The subsoil may be yellowish-red, sandy clay loam (Orangeburg series), yellowish-brown sandy clay loam (Norfolk series), or strong brown sandy clay (Marlboro series). All belong to the &lt;a href=\"Ultisol\"&gt;Ultisol&lt;/a&gt; soil order.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water (2.01%). Approximately \u2154 of Columbia's land area, , is contained within the Fort Jackson Military Installation, much of which consists of uninhabited training grounds. The actual inhabited area for the city is slightly more than .\nClimate.\nColumbia has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; \"Cfa\"), with relatively cool to mild winters and hot and humid summers. The area averages 55 nights below freezing and is subject to temporary &lt;a href=\"Cold%20wave\"&gt;cold spells&lt;/a&gt; during the winter, but extended cold or days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing are both rare. These cold snaps usually result from atmospheric &lt;a href=\"Trough%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;troughs&lt;/a&gt; that bring in cold air from Canada across the Eastern part of the country. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture\"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt; places Columbia in the 8a &lt;a href=\"Hardiness%20zone\"&gt;Hardiness Zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith an annual average of 5 days with + and 72 days with + temperatures, the city's current promotional slogan describes Columbia as \"Famously Hot\". In the summer months, Columbia usually has the greatest high temperature in the state. One reason for this is its low &lt;a href=\"elevation\"&gt;elevation&lt;/a&gt; in comparison to other cities at similar latitudes. For example, &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; has a significantly higher elevation, which helps to moderate its summer temperatures. Secondly, the city lies in the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Sandhills%20%28Carolina%29\"&gt;Sandhills&lt;/a&gt; region. Since the region's soils are more sandy, they contain less water and can warm up more quickly. This explains why usually only the high temperatures and not the low temperatures are much different from across the state. Thirdly, because of its distance from the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, it does not receive the same moderating effects of coastal cities like &lt;a href=\"Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Charleston&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the city experiences the &lt;a href=\"urban%20heat%20island\"&gt;urban heat island&lt;/a&gt; effect, making it significantly warmer than some surrounding towns and cities.\nPrecipitation, at annually, peaks in the summer months largely because of afternoon thunderstorms, and is the least during spring and fall. Snowfall averages , but is largely variable depending on the year. Snow flurries usually do fall at least once during the winter season during its coldest periods. Like much of the southeastern U.S., the city is prone to &lt;a href=\"Temperature%20inversion\"&gt;inversions&lt;/a&gt;, which trap ozone and other pollutants over the area.\nOfficial extremes in temperature at the main weather station have ranged from on &lt;a href=\"Summer%202012%20North%20American%20heat%20wave\"&gt;June 29 and 30, 2012&lt;/a&gt; down to , set on &lt;a href=\"Great%20Blizzard%20of%201899\"&gt;February 14, 1899&lt;/a&gt;. Only one other sub-zero temperature has been recored in Columbia: on &lt;a href=\"January%201985%20Arctic%20outbreak\"&gt;January 21, 1985&lt;/a&gt;. A weather station at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;University of South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; campus measured a reading of on June 29, 2012, which is the highest temperature ever recorded in South Carolina.\nMetropolitan area.\nThe &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20statistical%20area\"&gt;metropolitan statistical area&lt;/a&gt; of Columbia is the second-largest in South Carolina; it has a population of 817,488 according to the 2016 Census estimates.\nColumbia's metropolitan counties include:\nColumbia's suburbs and environs include:\nDemographics.\n2020 census.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20census\"&gt;2020 United States census&lt;/a&gt;, there were 136,632 people, 45,474 households, and 22,243 families residing in the city.\n2010 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 129,272 people, 52,471 total households, and 22,638 families residing in the city.

The historic &lt;a href=\"Congaree%20Vista\"&gt;Congaree Vista&lt;/a&gt;, a district running from the central business district toward the Congaree River, features a number of historic buildings that have been rehabilitated since its revitalization begun in the late 1980s. Of note is the &lt;a href=\"adaptive%20reuse\"&gt;adaptive reuse&lt;/a&gt; of the Confederate Printing Plant on Gervais and Huger, used to print Confederate bills during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. The city cooperated with &lt;a href=\"Publix\"&gt;Publix&lt;/a&gt; grocery stores to preserve the look. This won Columbia an award from the International Downtown Association. The Vista district is also where the region's convention center and anchor &lt;a href=\"Hilton%20Hotels\"&gt;Hilton&lt;/a&gt; hotel with a &lt;a href=\"Ruth%27s%20Chris%20Steakhouse\"&gt;Ruth's Chris Steakhouse&lt;/a&gt; restaurant are located. Other notable developments under construction and recently completed include high-end condos and townhomes, hotels, and mixed-use structures.\nThe older buildings lining the Vista's main thoroughfare, Gervais Street, now house art galleries, restaurants, unique shops, and professional office space. Near the end of Gervais is the &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina%20State%20Museum\"&gt;South Carolina State Museum&lt;/a&gt; and the EdVenture Children's Museum. Private student housing and some residential projects are going up nearby; the CanalSide development at the site of the old Central Correctional Institution, is the most high-profile. Completed in 2018, CanalSide is a 23-acre mixed-use development in the Vista on the Congaree River and is home to 750 residential rental apartments: townhomes, condominiums and lofts. Lady Street between Huger and Assembly streets in the Vista and the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Points%20%28Columbia%29\"&gt;Five Points neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; have undergone beautification projects, which mainly consisted of replacing curbs and gutters, and adding brick-paved sidewalks and angled parking.\nSpecial revitalization efforts are being aimed at Main Street, which began seeing an exodus of department and specialty stores in the 1990s. The goal is to re-establish Main Street as a vibrant commercial and residential corridor, and the stretch of Main Street home to most businesses\u2014-from Gervais to Blanding streets\u2014-has been streetscaped in recent years. Notable developments completed in recent years along Main Street include an 18-story, $60 million tower at the high-profile corner of Main and Gervais streets, the renovation of the 1441 Main Street office building as the new Midlands headquarters for &lt;a href=\"Wells%20Fargo\"&gt;Wells Fargo&lt;/a&gt; Bank (formerly &lt;a href=\"Wachovia\"&gt;Wachovia&lt;/a&gt; Bank), a new sanctuary for the Holy Trinity &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Orthodox\"&gt;Greek Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; Church, the location of Mast General store in the historic &lt;a href=\"Efird%27s%20Department%20Store\"&gt;Efird's building&lt;/a&gt;, and the relocation of the Nickelodeon theater. A fa\u00e7ade improvement program for the downtown business district, implemented in 2011, has resulted in the restoration and improvement of the fa\u00e7ades of several historic Main Street shopfronts. One of the most ambitious development projects in the city's history is currently underway which involves old state mental health campus downtown on Bull Street. Known formally as Columbia Common, this project will consist of rehabbing several historic buildings on the campus, as well as constructing new buildings, for residential, hospitality, and retail use. A minor league baseball stadium was built on the campus in 2016. Named &lt;a href=\"Segra%20Park\"&gt;Segra Park&lt;/a&gt;, it is home to the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Fireflies\"&gt;Columbia Fireflies&lt;/a&gt;.\nArts and culture.\nMovies filmed in the Columbia area include &lt;a href=\"The%20Program%20%281993%20film%29\"&gt;\"The Program\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20Man%20%28film%29\"&gt;\"Renaissance Man\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Chasers\"&gt;Chasers&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Death%20Sentence%20%282007%20film%29\"&gt;\"Death Sentence\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Guy%20Named%20Joe\"&gt;A Guy Named Joe&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Accidental%20Love\"&gt;Accidental Love&lt;/a&gt;/Nailed\".\nVenues.\nColumbia Metropolitan Convention Center.\nThe Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center, which opened in September 2004 as South Carolina's only downtown convention center, is a , modern, state-of-the-art facility designed to host a variety of meetings and conventions.

The arena could be easily adapted to serve other entertainment purposes, including concerts, car shows, circuses, ice shows, and other events. The versatility and quality of the coliseum at one time allowed the university to use the facility for performing arts events such as the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Pops\"&gt;Boston Pops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Symphony\"&gt;Chicago Symphony&lt;/a&gt;, Feld Ballet, and other performances by important artists. An acoustical shell and a state-of-the-art lighting system assisted the coliseum in presenting such activities. The coliseum was the home of the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Inferno\"&gt;Columbia Inferno&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"ECHL\"&gt;ECHL&lt;/a&gt; team. However, since the construction of the Colonial Life Arena in 2002, the coliseum now is the center for the men's and women's basketball programs, with the center arena now housing the two main practice courts.\nTownship Auditorium.\n&lt;a href=\"Township%20Auditorium\"&gt;Township Auditorium&lt;/a&gt; seats 3,099 capacity and is located in downtown Columbia. The &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20architecture\"&gt;Georgian Revival&lt;/a&gt; building was designed by the Columbia architectural firm of Lafaye and Lafaye and constructed in 1930. The Township has hosted thousands of events from concerts to conventions to wrestling matches. The auditorium was listed in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; on September 28, 2005, and has recently undergone a $12 million extensive interior and exterior renovation.\nSports.\nThe most popular sports in Columbia are the sports programs at the University of South Carolina. Columbia also offers minor league, semi-pro, and amateur sports. In April 2017 the women's Gamecocks basketball team won the NCAA national championship, defeating Mississippi State 67\u201355.\nColumbia has also hosted the women's U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials in 1996 and 2000 and the 2007 Junior Wildwater World Championships, which featured many European canoe and kayak racers. The Colonial Life Arena has also hosted &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; exhibition games.\nSports venues.\n&lt;a href=\"Williams-Brice%20Stadium\"&gt;Williams-Brice Stadium&lt;/a&gt; is the home of the USC Gamecocks' football team and is the 24th largest college football stadium in the nation. It seats 80,250 people and is located just south of downtown Columbia. The stadium was built in 1934 with the help of federal Works Progress Administration funds, and initially seated 17,600. The original name was Carolina Stadium, but on September 9, 1972, it was renamed to honor the Williams and Brice families. Mrs. Martha Williams-Brice had left much of her estate to the university for stadium renovations and expansions. Her late husband, Thomas H. Brice, played football for the university from 1922 to 1924.\n&lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Life%20Arena\"&gt;Colonial Life Arena&lt;/a&gt;, opened in 2002, is Columbia's premier arena and entertainment facility.

The facility also features a sound system and scoreboard.\nOn January 6, 2015, developers broke ground on the $37 million &lt;a href=\"Segra%20Park\"&gt;Segra Park&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium is the home for the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Fireflies\"&gt;Columbia Fireflies&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Minor League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; team playing in the &lt;a href=\"Low-A%20East\"&gt;Low-A East&lt;/a&gt;. It opened in April 2016 and can seat up to 7,501 people. Columbia had been without minor league baseball since the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City%20Bombers\"&gt;Capital City Bombers&lt;/a&gt; relocated to &lt;a href=\"Greenville%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Greenville, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, in 2004.\nParks and recreation.\n&lt;a href=\"Finlay%20Park\"&gt;Finlay Park&lt;/a&gt; has hosted events from festivals and political rallies to road races and Easter Sunrise services. This park has had two lives; first dedicated in 1859 as Sidney Park, named in honor of Algernon Sidney Johnson, a Columbia City Councilman, the park experienced an illustrious but short tenure. The park fell into disrepair after the Civil War and served as a site for commercial ventures until the late 20th century. In 1990, the park was reopened. It serves as the site for such events as Kids Day, The Summer Concert Series, plus many more activities. In 1992, the park was renamed Finlay Park, in honor of Kirkman Finlay, a past mayor of Columbia who had a vision to reenergize the historic Congaree Vista district, between Main Street and the river, and recreate the site that was formerly known as Sidney Park. The city has plans for an $18 million upgrade of the park in the near future which will include a redesigned parking lot near Laurel Street; a significant overhaul of the pond; construction of a pair of scenic streams; brand new shelters, restrooms, plazas, and performance stage; new waterfall features; and a new, large playground with a splash pad.\nMemorial Park is a tract of land in the Congaree Vista between Main Street and the river. The property is bordered by Hampton, Gadsden, Washington, and Wayne Streets and is one block south of Finlay Park. This park was created to serve as a memorial to those who served their country and presently has monuments honoring the &lt;a href=\"USS%20Columbia\"&gt;USS Columbia&lt;/a&gt; warship and those that served with her during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the China-Burma-India Theater Veterans of WWII, casualties of the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; attack of December 7, 1941, who were from South Carolina, &lt;a href=\"Holocaust%20survivors\"&gt;Holocaust survivors&lt;/a&gt; who live in South Carolina as well as concentration camp liberators from South Carolina, and the State &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; Veterans. The park was dedicated in November 1986 along with the unveiling of the South Carolina Vietnam Monument. In June 2000, the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt; Memorial was dedicated at Memorial Park. In November 2014, Columbia native and resident of Boston, Henry Crede, gave a bronze statue and plaza in the park dedicated to his WWII comrades who served in the Navy from South Carolina.\nGranby Park opened in November 1998 as a gateway to the rivers of Columbia, adding another access to the many river activities available to residents. Granby is part of the Three Rivers Greenway, a system of green spaces along the banks of the rivers in Columbia, adding another piece to the long-range plan and eventually connecting to the existing Riverfront Park. Granby is a linear park with canoe access points, fishing spots, bridges, and \u00bd mile of nature trail along the banks of the Congaree River.\nIn the Five Points district of downtown Columbia is the park dedicated to the legacy and memory of civil rights leader, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.\"&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/a&gt; Formerly known as Valley Park, it was renamed in the late 1980s. The park features a water sculpture and a community center. An integral element of the park is the Stone of Hope monument, unveiled in January 1996. The monument is inscribed with a portion of King's 1964 &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Peace%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; acceptance speech: \"History is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued that self-defeating path of hate. Love is the key to the solutions of the problems of the world.\"\nOne of Columbia's greatest assets is &lt;a href=\"Riverbanks%20Zoo\"&gt;Riverbanks Zoo &amp; Garden&lt;/a&gt;. Riverbanks Zoo is a sanctuary for more than 2,000 animals housed in natural habitat exhibits along the Saluda River. Just across the river, the botanical garden is devoted to gardens, woodlands, plant collections, and historic ruins. Riverbanks has been named one of America's best zoos and the No. 1 travel attraction in the Southeast. It attracted over one million visitors in 2009.\nSituated along the meandering Congaree River in central South Carolina, &lt;a href=\"Congaree%20National%20Park\"&gt;Congaree National Park&lt;/a&gt; is home to champion trees, primeval forest landscapes, and diverse plant and animal life. This park protects the largest contiguous tract of old-growth bottomland hardwood forest remaining in the United States. The park is an international &lt;a href=\"biosphere%20reserve\"&gt;biosphere reserve&lt;/a&gt;. Known for its giant hardwoods and towering pines, the park's floodplain forest includes one of the highest canopies in the world and some of the tallest trees in the eastern United States. Congaree National Park provides a sanctuary for plants and animals, a research site for scientists, and a place to walk and relax in a tranquil wilderness setting.\n&lt;a href=\"Sesquicentennial%20State%20Park\"&gt;Sesquicentennial State Park&lt;/a&gt; is a park, featuring a lake surrounded by trails and picnic areas. The park's proximity to downtown Columbia and three major interstate highways attracts both local residents and travelers. Sesquicentennial is often the site of family reunions and group campouts. Interpretive nature programs are a major attraction to the park. The park also contains a two-story log house, dating back to the mid 18th century, which was relocated to the park in 1969. This house is believed to be the oldest building still standing in Richland County. The park was originally built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Evidence of their craftsmanship is still present today.\nIn November 1996, the River Alliance proposed that a linear park system be created to link people to their rivers. This was named the Three Rivers Greenway, and the $18 million estimated cost was agreed to by member governments (the cities of &lt;a href=\"Cayce%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Cayce&lt;/a&gt;, Columbia, and &lt;a href=\"West%20Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;West Columbia&lt;/a&gt;) with the proviso that the Alliance recommend an acceptable funding strategy.\nWhile the funding process was underway, an existing city of Columbia site located on the &lt;a href=\"Congaree%20River\"&gt;Congaree River&lt;/a&gt; offered an opportunity to be a pilot project for the Three Rivers Greenway. The Alliance was asked to design and permit for construction by a general contractor this component. This approximately one-half-mile segment of the system was opened in November 1998. It is complete with wide concrete pathways, vandal-proof lighting, trash receptacles, water fountains, picnic benches, overlooks, bank fishing access, canoe/kayak access, a public restroom and parking. These set the standards for the common elements in the rest of the system. Eventually, pathways will run from Granby to the Riverbanks Zoo. Boaters, sportspeople, and fisherpeople will have access to the area, and additional recreational uses are being planned along the miles of riverfront.\nRunning beside the historic &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Canal\"&gt;Columbia Canal&lt;/a&gt;, Riverfront Park hosts a two and a half-mile trail. Spanning the canal is an old railway bridge that now is a pedestrian walkway. The park is used for walking, running, bicycling, and fishing. &lt;a href=\"Picnic%20table\"&gt;Picnic table&lt;/a&gt;s and benches dot the walking trail. Markers are located along the trail so that visitors can measure distance. The park is part of the Palmetto Trail, a hiking and biking trail that stretches the entire length of the state, from &lt;a href=\"Greenville%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Greenville&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Charleston&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther parks in the Columbia area include:\nGovernment.\nThe city of Columbia has a &lt;a href=\"council-manager\"&gt;council-manager&lt;/a&gt; form of government. The mayor and &lt;a href=\"city%20council\"&gt;city council&lt;/a&gt; are elected every four years, with no &lt;a href=\"term%20limit\"&gt;term limit&lt;/a&gt;s. Elections are held in the spring. Unlike other mayors in council-manager systems, the Columbia mayor has the power to veto &lt;a href=\"local%20ordinance\"&gt;ordinance&lt;/a&gt;s passed by the council; vetoes can be overridden by a two-thirds majority of the council, which appoints a &lt;a href=\"city%20manager\"&gt;city manager&lt;/a&gt; to serve as chief administrative officer. The current mayor is Daniel Rickenmann, who succeeded &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20K.%20Benjamin\"&gt;Stephen K. Benjamin&lt;/a&gt; on January 4, 2022.\nThe city council consists of six members, four from districts and two elected &lt;a href=\"at-large\"&gt;at-large&lt;/a&gt;.
