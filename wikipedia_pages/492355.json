    "text": "The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is Australia's &lt;a href=\"central%20bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt; and banknote issuing authority. It has had this role since 14 January 1960, when the \"Reserve Bank Act 1959\" removed the central banking functions from the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Bank\"&gt;Commonwealth Bank&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bank has the responsibility of providing services to the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Government of Australia&lt;/a&gt; in addition to also providing services to other central banks and official institutions. It currently consists of the Payments System Board, which governs the &lt;a href=\"payment%20system\"&gt;payments system&lt;/a&gt; policy of the bank, and the Reserve Bank Board, which governs all other monetary and banking policies of the bank.\nBoth boards consist of members of both the bank, the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20the%20Treasury%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Treasury&lt;/a&gt;, other Australian government agencies, and leaders of other institutions that are part of the &lt;a href=\"Economy%20of%20Australia\"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt;. The structure of the Reserve Bank Board has remained consistent ever since 1951, with the exception of the change in the number of members of the board. The governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia is appointed by the &lt;a href=\"Treasurer%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Treasurer&lt;/a&gt; and chairs both the Payment Systems and Reserve Bank Boards and when there are disagreements between both boards, the governor resolves them.\nFrom the middle of the 19th century into the 1890s, the prospects for the forming of a &lt;a href=\"national%20bank\"&gt;national bank&lt;/a&gt; grew. In 1911, the Commonwealth Bank was established, but did not have the authority to print notes, which was a power that was still reserved to the Treasury. A movement toward reestablishing the &lt;a href=\"gold%20standard\"&gt;gold standard&lt;/a&gt; occurred after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, with John Garvan leading various boards in contracting the &lt;a href=\"money%20supply\"&gt;money supply&lt;/a&gt; on the route to doing so, and the gold standard was instituted for both the &lt;a href=\"Pound%20sterling\"&gt;British pound sterling&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20pound\"&gt;Australian pound&lt;/a&gt; in 1925.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;, the Australian pound became devalued, no longer worth the same as the pound sterling, and formally departed from the gold standard with the Commonwealth Bank Act of 1932. Legislation in 1945 led to &lt;a href=\"regulation\"&gt;regulation&lt;/a&gt; of private banks which &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Coombs\"&gt;Herbert Coombs&lt;/a&gt; was opposed to, and when he became governor in 1949, he gave them more overall control over their institutions. When the monetary authorities implemented the advice of Coombs to have a flexible &lt;a href=\"interest%20rate\"&gt;interest rate&lt;/a&gt;, it allowed the bank to rely more on &lt;a href=\"open%20market%20operations\"&gt;open market operations&lt;/a&gt;. In 1980 the issue of short-term government bonds \u2013 Treasury notes of 13 and 26 weeks duration \u2013 changed from a tap system, in which the price was set, to a tender system in which the volume of stock was set and the price determined by the market. Soon afterwards the tender system was extended to the issue of longer-term government bonds.\nThe &lt;a href=\"floating%20currency\"&gt;float&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20dollar\"&gt;Australian dollar&lt;/a&gt; happened in 1983, around the same period of time that the financial system in Australia was deregulated. Administration of the banks was transferred in 1998 from the bank to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Prudential%20Regulation%20Authority\"&gt;Australian Prudential Regulation Authority&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"%23Payments%20System%20Board%20and%20the%20ACCC\"&gt;Payments System Board&lt;/a&gt; was created, while the bank was given power within the board in the same year. The current governor of the Reserve Bank is &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Lowe\"&gt;Philip Lowe&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Stevens\"&gt;Glenn Stevens&lt;/a&gt; as governor on 18 September 2016.\nHistory.\nMid-19th century\u20131924.\nProposals for a national bank in Australia were first raised in the mid-19th century, and got a significant boost in the 1890s as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20banking%20crisis%20of%201893\"&gt;Australian banking crisis of 1893&lt;/a&gt; during which many commercial banks and building societies collapsed, leading to a general economic depression. The &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party\"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, formed during this period, proposed a bank which would be a protected and cheap way of providing &lt;a href=\"financial%20services\"&gt;financial services&lt;/a&gt;. The party's platform for the 1908 election was for a \"Commonwealth Bank\", which would have both &lt;a href=\"commercial%20bank\"&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"central%20bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt; functions.\nRegardless, Fisher's &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Fisher%23Second%20government%201910%E2%80%9313\"&gt;Labor government&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Bank\"&gt;Commonwealth Bank&lt;/a&gt; by the \"Commonwealth Bank Act 1911\", with effect on 22 December 1911. The new bank was a government-owned commercial bank, without any central bank functions. He stated that \"Time and experience will show how its functions for usefulness may be extended [towards central banking].\" The only function at the time that made the bank characteristic of a central one was that it was the banker to the Australian government, in addition to it being the same for the &lt;a href=\"states%20of%20Australia\"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20the%20Treasury%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Treasury of Australia&lt;/a&gt; maintained the role of issuing bank notes through the \"&lt;a href=\"Australian%20Notes%20Act%201910\"&gt;Australian Notes Act 1910&lt;/a&gt;\". The bank was also the first bank in Australia to receive a federal government guarantee. \nThe Commonwealth Bank gradually acquired central bank functions. In response to the disruption of trade during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; (1914\u20131918) the Commonwealth Bank began to manage the Australian government debt. Nevertheless, at the end of the war, the bank's primary role was as a &lt;a href=\"savings%20bank\"&gt;savings&lt;/a&gt; and trading bank. In the war, to fund the great increase in government spending, the &lt;a href=\"currency%20of%20Australia\"&gt;currency of Australia&lt;/a&gt; went off the &lt;a href=\"gold%20standard\"&gt;gold standard&lt;/a&gt;, as did those of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and other parts of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Australian%20pound\"&gt;Australian pound&lt;/a&gt; remained tied to the &lt;a href=\"pound%20sterling\"&gt;pound sterling&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Inflation\"&gt;Inflation&lt;/a&gt; in Australia thus increased, less than in Britain, but more than in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The case for a central bank was increased by the need for the government to cut spending after the war to reduce its debt. Commonwealth Bank Governor &lt;a href=\"Denison%20Miller\"&gt;Denison Miller&lt;/a&gt; had been arguing for the issue of Australian currency to be switched from the treasury to the bank, as it had more staff and more monetary knowledge.\nThe Australian Notes Board (ANB) was created in 1920 and partially acceded to Miller's request, in having four directors, with the &lt;a href=\"%23Governors%20and%20their%20roles\"&gt;governor&lt;/a&gt; of the bank being an \"&lt;a href=\"ex%20officio\"&gt;ex officio&lt;/a&gt;\" member. The ANB began to follow a policy of board member John Garvan, in contracting the &lt;a href=\"money%20supply\"&gt;money supply&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of reducing prices so that free convertibility of the Australian pound to gold could be re-established at pre-war rates, that is return to the former gold standard.\nThis was accomplished by refusing the exchange of notes for gold and it was hoped that this would lower domestic prices and raise the exchange rate for the Australian pound. When gold arrived from &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; the government sold &lt;a href=\"government%20securities\"&gt;securities&lt;/a&gt; to diminish the effect of &lt;a href=\"monetary%20expansion\"&gt;monetary expansion&lt;/a&gt;, therefore executing the first &lt;a href=\"open%20market%20operations\"&gt;open market operations&lt;/a&gt; in the history of Australia and thus the first attempt of central banking.\n1924\u2013present.\nThe Department of Treasury issued notes until 1924, when this responsibility was transferred to the Commonwealth Bank. The ANB was abolished by the Commonwealth Bank Act 1924, due to &lt;a href=\"Treasurer%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Treasurer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"National%20Party%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Country Party&lt;/a&gt; Leader &lt;a href=\"Earle%20Page\"&gt;Earle Page&lt;/a&gt; wanting to end the monetary contraction which particularly hurt his farming constituents, who were as a result receiving reduced export prices. The new Board of Directors replacing it, which was composed of various areas of the &lt;a href=\"Economy%20of%20Australia\"&gt;industry&lt;/a&gt;, soon appointed Garvan chairman, and thus he continued his policies. In 1925, both the pound sterling and Australian pound returned to the pre-war gold standard. The primary role of the Commonwealth Bank continued to be a savings and trading bank, even though the government attempted to make the bank into a central bank through its actions in 1924.\nLegislation was introduced to the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; at the climax of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;, in May 1930, by Treasurer E.G. Theodore, to transfer central banking powers from the Commonwealth Bank to a new central bank, but this failed. The Australian pound was devalued in 1931 and it ceased to be tied to the &lt;a href=\"pound%20sterling\"&gt;pound sterling&lt;/a&gt;. The Reserve Bank departed from the gold standard with the Commonwealth Bank Act 1932, which made the notes no longer exchangeable into gold and allowed the bank not to keep any gold reserves. The &lt;a href=\"monetary%20policy\"&gt;monetary policy&lt;/a&gt; of the bank from 1931 until the early 1970s had been to keep a stable &lt;a href=\"exchange%20rate\"&gt;exchange rate&lt;/a&gt; with the pound sterling.\nThrough the new Commonwealth Bank Act and the Banking Act 1945, the board was replaced by a six-member council, consisting of bank and treasury officials. It additionally formalised the bank's administrative powers of monetary and banking policy and exchange control and also stated the governor was responsible for managing the bank. Highly debated legislation in 1945 caused high amounts of regulation on &lt;a href=\"private%20banks\"&gt;private banks&lt;/a&gt;, which later-Governor &lt;a href=\"H.C.%20Coombs\"&gt;H.C. Coombs&lt;/a&gt; was opposed to, along with his opposition to bank &lt;a href=\"nationalisation\"&gt;nationalisation&lt;/a&gt; in 1947. When he became governor in 1949, he allowed private banks to have more control over their &lt;a href=\"liquidity\"&gt;liquidity&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to introduce &lt;a href=\"Market%20economy\"&gt;market-based&lt;/a&gt; monetary policy. He also warned of the possibility of &lt;a href=\"stagflation\"&gt;stagflation&lt;/a&gt; in 1959.\nLegislation in 1951, substituted the council by a 10-member board which included the governor, deputy governor and the secretary to the treasury. The board took over the management of the bank from the governor. The Reserve Bank Act 1959 (23 April 1959) took out the part of the Commonwealth Bank that executed central bank functions and placed it into the new Reserve Bank, while the commercial and savings bank functions stayed with the Commonwealth Bank. This finally created a separate central bank for Australia in 1959, which took effect 14 January 1960, many years after several other nations already had one and similar to the early proposal by Treasurer Theodore.\nIn the mid-1960s, monetary authorities accepted Coombs' conclusions and allowed a flexible &lt;a href=\"interest%20rate\"&gt;interest rate&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier for the bank to rely on &lt;a href=\"open%20market%20operations\"&gt;open market operations&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Exchange%20Control\"&gt;Exchange Control&lt;/a&gt; was abolished after the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20currency\"&gt;float&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20dollar\"&gt;Australian dollar&lt;/a&gt; occurred in 1983. In the five years after the Campbell Committee probe, 1979\u20131984, the financial system in Australia became &lt;a href=\"Deregulation\"&gt;deregulated&lt;/a&gt;. Another probe was the Wallis Committee in 1996, which took effect in 1998. The effects were the transfer of overseeing the banks from the RBA to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Prudential%20Regulation%20Authority\"&gt;Australian Prudential Regulation Authority&lt;/a&gt; (APRA) and the creation of the Payments System Board (PSB), which would attempt to maintain the safety and performance of the &lt;a href=\"payments%20system\"&gt;payments system&lt;/a&gt;. The bank was given powers within the PSB through additional legislation in 1998.\nIn August 1996, then Governor-designate &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Macfarlane%20%28economist%29\"&gt;Ian Macfarlane&lt;/a&gt; and the Treasurer issued a \"Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy\" which restated the roles of the Reserve Bank and the Government of Australia. It affirmed government endorsement of the Reserve Bank's inflation objective, which was introduced in 1993. A change of government in December 2007 led to another \"Statement\", which was issued by both former Treasurer &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Swan\"&gt;Wayne Swan&lt;/a&gt; and Reserve Bank Governor &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Stevens\"&gt;Glenn Stevens&lt;/a&gt;. This amends previous statements by giving the bank independence and encourages &lt;a href=\"Transparency%20%28behavior%29\"&gt;transparency&lt;/a&gt; and communication.\n\"Securency\" scandal.\nSince 2007, the RBA's reputation has been affected by the 'Securency' or Note Printing Australia scandal. These RBA subsidiaries were involved in bribing overseas officials so that Australia might win lucrative polymer note-printing contracts. Australian press coverage, which continued into late 2011, reflects concerns with the apparent laxity and tardiness of corrective actions undertaken by relevant RBA board members and officials. The matters were not reported to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Federal%20Police\"&gt;Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, although they have been since, while in 2011 it was revealed that the RBA had to correct inaccurate evidence previously given to parliamentary committees.\nIn July 2014, &lt;a href=\"WikiLeaks\"&gt;WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt; released a copy of a court order prohibiting publication throughout Australia of information that \"reveals, implies, suggests or alleges\" corruption involving specifically named past and present high-ranking Malaysian, Indonesian, and Vietnamese officials in relation to the Note Printing Australia bribery allegations.\nRoles and responsibilities.\nIt is currently governed by the Reserve Bank Act 1959. The Reserve Bank Board's duty stated in the Act, within its outlined boundaries, is to ensure that the bank's monetary and banking policy is used to help the Australian population. This should be accomplished through consultation with the government and so in the Reserve Bank Board's opinion that its powers are used to help with:\nIn practice the Reserve Bank concentrates on the &lt;a href=\"open%20market%20operation\"&gt;first objective&lt;/a&gt;, that is to control inflation through &lt;a href=\"monetary%20policy\"&gt;monetary policy&lt;/a&gt;. The current objective is a policy of &lt;a href=\"inflation%20targeting\"&gt;inflation targeting&lt;/a&gt; aimed at maintaining the annual inflation rate at between \"2\u20133 per cent, on average, over the &lt;a href=\"Business%20cycle\"&gt;cycle&lt;/a&gt;\". This target was first set in 1993 by the then Reserve Bank Governor &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Fraser%20%28economist%29\"&gt;Bernie Fraser&lt;/a&gt; and was then formalised in 1996 by the then &lt;a href=\"Treasurer%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Treasurer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Costello\"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; and incoming Reserve Bank Governor Ian Mcfarlane.\nThe Reserve Bank gives banking and registry services to agencies of the government, to other central banks, and other official institutions. The assets of the bank include the gold and foreign exchange reserves of Australia, which is estimated to have a &lt;a href=\"net%20worth\"&gt;net worth&lt;/a&gt; of A$101 billion.\nNearly 94% of the RBA's employees work at its headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and at the Business Resumption Site. The remainder of the total 926 staff work in &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brisbane\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canberra\"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perth\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. A wholly owned subsidiary of the bank is &lt;a href=\"Note%20Printing%20Australia\"&gt;Note Printing Australia&lt;/a&gt;, which employs 257 other workers, and which manufactures the Australian dollar and other securities, for markets both in and outside of Australia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"%23Payments%20System%20Board%20and%20the%20ACCC\"&gt;Payments System Board&lt;/a&gt; fills the role of deciding on the bank's payments system policy and the &lt;a href=\"%23Reserve%20Bank%20Board\"&gt;Reserve Bank Board&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for all other monetary and banking policies of the bank. Conflicts between the two Boards do not occur often, and when they do, they are resolved by the &lt;a href=\"%23Governors%20and%20their%20roles\"&gt;governor&lt;/a&gt;.\nReserve Bank Board.\nThe Reserve Bank Board consists of nine members in total. These members include the three \"&lt;a href=\"ex%20officio\"&gt;ex officio&lt;/a&gt;\" members of the board, consisting of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, who is Chair of the Board, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, who is the Deputy Chair of the Board, and the Secretary to the Treasury.\nIn addition, the board is composed of six external members who are appointed by the Treasurer for a period of five years. According to section 17(1) of the Reserve Bank Act, members of the board are not allowed to be a director, officer, or employee of an institution that is authorised to take in deposits. Excluding changes in the number of members, the structure of the board has remained unchanged since 1951.\nThe current members of the board are:\nThe board normally meets eleven times each year, on the first Tuesday of each month except January. Board meetings are usually held at the Reserve Bank's Head Office in Sydney. Meetings are held in two other Australian cities each year. Five members of the board must meet in order to constitute a quorum, and the meeting must be chaired by the governor, or the deputy governor in his absence.\nThe board usually forms a consensus without a need for structured voting on the issues at hand. Meetings of the board are held in the boardroom of the Reserve Bank's Head Office in Sydney or a similar facility in one of the Bank's State Offices when meetings are held interstate (a secure location is used in Australian cities where the Bank does not have its own premises). The meetings begin at 9.00 am and continue for three and a half hours, with minutes published two weeks after the meeting is held.\nPayments System Board and the ACCC.\nThe Reserve Bank Act 1959 allows the Payments System Board to decide the Reserve Bank's payment systems policy. This is done so it can control risk, promote efficiency and to aid in competitiveness and balance in the financial system. The bank's power through the Payment Systems Act 1998 allows it to regulate any payment system and can create binding rules for security and performance in the system. If members of a payment system are at odds over issues of &lt;a href=\"market%20risk\"&gt;market risk&lt;/a&gt;, admission, safety, and rivalry, the RBA can additionally administer arbitration with the consent of those involved. The Reserve Bank is also permitted to gather information from a payment system or participants thereof. The bank was also given the power to regulate the &lt;a href=\"Clearing%20house%20%28finance%29\"&gt;competition of transactions&lt;/a&gt; in August 2001.\nThe Payment Systems and Netting Act 1998 gives the board power in areas of the law that were previously uncertain. It removed the zero hour rule that allowed a bankruptcy to date a bankruptcy the previous midnight and the Act made it so payments the same day could not be undone. Before the removal of the zero hour rule, the &lt;a href=\"Real%20Time%20Gross%20Settlement\"&gt;Real Time Gross Settlement&lt;/a&gt; system had been violated because payments in the system should inherently not be reversed. Some payments systems had previously agreed to pay and receive obligations to the whole system, rather than merely maintaining their own. But in the event of a bankruptcy, the bankrupt institution did not pay what it owed back to the solvent parties, while they had to pay their dues to the failed bank. This was later changed, when cheques were deemed void if the bankrupt institution doesn't have the funds to back them up, after the Cheques Act 1986 was amended in 1998. The Trade Practices Act 1974 generally does not allow competitors to make cooperative agreements, but if the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Competition%20%26amp%3B%20Consumer%20Commission\"&gt;Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission&lt;/a&gt; (ACCC) is permitted to make exceptions for competitors making agreements among themselves. The ACCC and the Payments Systems Board are encouraged to work together regarding access and rivalry through the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998.\nMembers of the Payment Systems Board are defined by Section 25A of the Reserve Bank Act 1959, with three of the members being \"ex officio\" or representatives of another organisation. The governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia is the Chairman of the Payments System Board, there is one representative of the RBA, and there is one representative of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Prudential%20Regulation%20Authority\"&gt;Australian Prudential Regulation Authority&lt;/a&gt; (APRA). In addition, there are up to five other members of the board that are appointed by the Treasurer for a term up to five years in length. They meet once per quarter, usually in Sydney with five members forming a &lt;a href=\"quorum\"&gt;quorum&lt;/a&gt;, which must be chaired by the Governor or, in his absence, the Deputy Chair. The Chairman meets with the Chairman of the ACCC at least once annually on issues of interest to both parties in the payments system, in addition to members of both organisations consulting over issues that are mutually important.\nThe current members of the Payments System Board are:\nGovernors and their roles.\nThe governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia is the most senior position in the Reserve Bank of Australia. The governor of the Commonwealth Bank of Reserve Bank of Australia was both an \"&lt;a href=\"ex%20officio\"&gt;ex officio&lt;/a&gt;\" member of the Notes Board from 1920 to 1924 and of the eight directors of the Commonwealth Bank from 1924 to 1945. The Commonwealth Bank and Bank Acts in 1945 clearly stated the governor's responsibilities of managing the bank. In 1951, legislation established a 10-member board which the governor is a member of. The bank has maintained a similar structure ever since the 1951 legislation.\nThe governor is required by the Reserve Bank Act 1959 to keep in contact with the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20the%20Treasury%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Secretary&lt;/a&gt; on matters concerning both the Treasury and Reserve Bank and . It is also mandated that the board inform the government of the bank's monetary and banking policy, which is often accomplished through the governor's meetings with the Treasurer. Since 1996, the governor and other senior members of the bank have appeared twice annually before the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics&lt;/a&gt; to explain the conduct of the bank. The Reserve Bank governor is appointed to a term of up to seven years by the Treasurer and are eligible to be reappointed at the end of their term. The governor is the chairman of both the Payment Systems Board and the Reserve Bank Board and therefore resolves any disputes that occur between the two entities.\nThe longest-serving governor, if his service to both the Commonwealth Bank and the Reserve Bank of Australia are included, is &lt;a href=\"H.C.%20Coombs\"&gt;H.C. Coombs&lt;/a&gt;, who served nineteen years and six months combined. He is regarded by some as one of the most committed anti-inflationists in government throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The longest-serving Commonwealth Bank governor is &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Riddle\"&gt;Sir Ernest Riddle&lt;/a&gt;, who served eleven years and four months, while the longest-serving Reserve Bank governor is &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Macfarlane%20%28economist%29\"&gt;Ian Macfarlane&lt;/a&gt;, who served ten years. The shortest-serving governor by many years is James Kell, who served 2 years for the Commonwealth Bank.\nHeritage listings.\nA number of buildings associated with the Reserve Bank are heritage-listed including:"
