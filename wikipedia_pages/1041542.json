    "text": "July Ordinances, also known as the Four Ordinances of Saint-Cloud, were a series of decrees set forth by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20X%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Armand%20de%20Polignac\"&gt;Jules Armand de Polignac&lt;/a&gt;, the chief minister, in July 1830. \nCompelled by what he felt to be a growing, manipulative radicalism in the elected government, Charles felt that as &lt;a href=\"king\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; by right of birth, his primary duty was the guarantee of order and &lt;a href=\"happiness\"&gt;happiness&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and its people; not in political bipartisanship and the self-interpreted rights of implacable political enemies. \nThe result was that on 9 July 1830, Charles announced that in his interpretation of, and in full compliance with, Article 14 of the &lt;a href=\"Charter%20of%201814\"&gt;Charter of 1814&lt;/a&gt;, he would henceforth govern by \"ordonnances\". On 25 July, while a guest at Saint-Cloud, he signed the infamous \"July Ordinances\" which were published in the Parisian newspaper \"Moniteur\" the following day. \nThe ordinances of 26 July:\nIt was intended to quell the people of &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. However, the ordinances had the opposite effect of angering the &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; citizens. Journalists gathered in protest at the headquarters of the \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20National%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt;\" daily, founded in January 1830 by &lt;a href=\"Adolphe%20Thiers\"&gt;Adolphe Thiers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armand%20Carrel\"&gt;Armand Carrel&lt;/a&gt;, and others. The final result was the &lt;a href=\"July%20Revolution\"&gt;July Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and Charles X's &lt;a href=\"abdication\"&gt;abdication&lt;/a&gt; and exile."
