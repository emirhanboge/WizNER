    "text": "B3: Battle by the Bay, the B4 Championships, and the B5 Championships were the first three instances of the &lt;a href=\"open%20%28sport%29\"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fighting%20game\"&gt;fighting game&lt;/a&gt; event that is now known as the annual &lt;a href=\"Evolution%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;Evolution Championship Series&lt;/a&gt;. B3 was created by Tom and Tony Cannon, Joey Cuellar, and Seth Killian, and was held in an arcade hall in &lt;a href=\"Sunnyvale%2C%20California\"&gt;Sunnyvale, California&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. B4 and B5 were held in &lt;a href=\"Folsom%2C%20California\"&gt;Folsom, California&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 and 2001 respectively, and the tournament was renamed Evolution in 2002. The three tournaments were entirely focused on the \"&lt;a href=\"Street%20Fighter\"&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Marvel%20vs.%20Capcom\"&gt;Capcom \"Versus\"&lt;/a&gt; video game franchises.\nThough the Battle by the Bay mainly drew in competitors from the \"Street Fighter\" tournament scenes that had coalesced in various cities throughout the United States in the mid-1990s, the tournaments also attracted international challengers early on.\nB3: Battle by the Bay.\nDuring the mid-1990s, a \"&lt;a href=\"Street%20Fighter%20II\"&gt;Street Fighter II&lt;/a&gt;\" tournament scene had coalesced in various cities across the United States. The &lt;a href=\"Golfland\"&gt;Golfland&lt;/a&gt; arcade hall in &lt;a href=\"Sunnyvale%2C%20California\"&gt;Sunnyvale, California&lt;/a&gt; was one of the hottest spots for competition in the country, with rivalries happening among various player groups, in particular between Northern and Southern California players. Players were also finding each other and discussing strategies through the &lt;a href=\"internet\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"message%20board\"&gt;message board&lt;/a&gt;s. The Battle by the Bay was conceived in order to quell debate over who was the best \"Street Fighter\" player in the country.\nB3: Battle by the Bay was organized by Tom \"inkblot\" Cannon, Tony \"Ponder\" Cannon, Joey \"MrWizard\" Cuellar, and Seth \"S-Kill\" Killian, and held in the Golfland arcade hall in Sunnyvale, California in 1996. The tournament had 40 contenders mostly from the United States, though B3 also featured players from Canada and Kuwait. Tom Cannon noted that the international interest in B3 had a big impact on him.\n&lt;a href=\"Alex%20Valle\"&gt;Alex Valle&lt;/a&gt; made his first major appearance at the Battle by the Bay, defeating &lt;a href=\"John%20Choi%20%28video%20game%20player%29\"&gt;John Choi&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Street%20Fighter%20Alpha%202\"&gt;Street Fighter Alpha 2&lt;/a&gt;\" grand finals. To win the tournament, Valle revealed an unblockable &lt;a href=\"combo%20%28video%20games%29\"&gt;combo&lt;/a&gt; he had discovered, which was dubbed the \"Valle CC.\"\nB4 Championships.\nThe B4 \"Street Fighter\" Championships were held on July 15\u201316, 2000, in &lt;a href=\"Folsom%2C%20California\"&gt;Folsom, California&lt;/a&gt;. Like B3 four years earlier, B4 featured a \"Super Street Fighter II Turbo\" and \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\", but B4 also introduced several new Capcom fighting games to the roster: \"&lt;a href=\"Street%20Fighter%20Alpha%203\"&gt;Street Fighter Alpha 3&lt;/a&gt;\", ', and '. The newly released \"Marvel vs. Capcom 2\" was the first non-\"Street Fighter\" game to be included, and a precedent for the tournament to branch out to other games. The &lt;a href=\"Marvel%20vs.%20Capcom\"&gt;\"Capcom Versus\"&lt;/a&gt; series has since had a large presence in the Battle of the Bay and Evolution Championship Series events.\nThe five winners of the \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\" tournament at B4 were flown to Japan to partake in 5v5 exhibition match between the top-ranking American and Japanese players. Here, &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Valle\"&gt;Alex Valle&lt;/a&gt; would face off against &lt;a href=\"Daigo%20Umehara\"&gt;Daigo Umehara&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. The lead up to this exhibition match was subject to a documentary directed by Peter Kang, titled \"Bang the Machine\".\nB5 Championships.\nHeld in August 2001 in &lt;a href=\"Folsom%2C%20California\"&gt;Folsom, California&lt;/a&gt;, the B5 Championships was attended by a much larger international crowd, particularly from Japan. \"\" made its introduction in the tournament roster at B5, and \"Marvel vs. Capcom 2\" was again a headliner of the event, being described by &lt;a href=\"TechTV\"&gt;TechTV&lt;/a&gt; as \"the hottest arcade fighting game of the season.\""
