    "text": "The UCLA Bruins are the &lt;a href=\"sport\"&gt;athletic&lt;/a&gt; teams that represent the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. The Bruin men's and women's teams participate in &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;NCAA Division I&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Pac-12%20Conference\"&gt;Pac-12 Conference&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Pacific%20Sports%20Federation\"&gt;Mountain Pacific Sports Federation&lt;/a&gt; (MPSF). For &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, they are in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Bowl%20Subdivision\"&gt;Football Bowl Subdivision&lt;/a&gt; of Division I (formerly Division I-A). \nUCLA is second to only &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20Cardinal\"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; as the school with the most NCAA team championships at 119 &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20NCAA%20schools%20with%20the%20most%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20championships\"&gt;NCAA team championships&lt;/a&gt;. \nUCLA offers 11 varsity sports programs for men and 14 for women.\nHistory.\nNickname and mascot.\nUpon UCLA's founding as the Southern Branch of the University of California in 1919, the football team was known as the \"Cubs\" because of its younger relationship to the &lt;a href=\"California%20Golden%20Bears\"&gt;California Bears&lt;/a&gt; in Berkeley. In 1923, the team adopted the nickname \"Grizzlies.\" In 1926, the Grizzlies became the 10th and final member of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Pacific Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt;, which already included the University of Montana Grizzlies. The school, which had taken the \"University of California at Los Angeles\" name that year, became the \"Bruins\" and has been recognized as such in the years since.\nThe Bruins began to use live bears as mascots in the 1930s, renting animals to appear at all UCLA home football games at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Memorial%20Coliseum\"&gt;Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;. The practice grew less common until the 1950s, when students and alumni brought \"Little Joe Bruin\" to Westwood. A Himalayan bear cub from India, \"Little Joe\" grew too large and was transferred to a circus. \"Josephine\" was purchased by a group of alumni in 1961 and was kept in the backyard of the Rally Committee chairman. She was eventually taken to the San Diego Zoo.\nA costumed mascot by the name of &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Bruin\"&gt;Joe Bruin&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in 1963. In 1967, the first female student to take the mascot role created Josephine \"Josie\" Bruin and joined Joe at athletic events. The design for the costumed bears has changed over the years, and Joe has had at least six looks over his history.\nTeam colors.\nThe UCLA athletic teams' colors are &lt;a href=\"UCLA%20Blue\"&gt;UCLA Blue&lt;/a&gt; and Westwood Gold. Blue symbolizes the ocean and wildflowers; yellow to reflect the Golden State, the California poppy and sunsets. The shades have shifted over the years with changing apparel sponsorships. The most recent update came in 2021 after &lt;a href=\"Nike%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Brand\"&gt;Jordan Brand&lt;/a&gt; began outfitting the Bruin varsity sports teams.\nIn the early days of the school, UCLA had the same colors as the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley\"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Yale%20blue\"&gt;Yale Blue&lt;/a&gt; and gold. When football coach Red Sanders came to UCLA for the 1949 season he redesigned the football uniforms. The Yale blue was changed to a lighter shade of blue. Sanders figured that the baby blue would look better on the field and in a film. He would dub the baby blue uniform \"powder-keg blue.\"\nIn 2002, UCLA Athletics and Adidas developed a new &lt;a href=\"True%20Blue%20%28color%29\"&gt;True Blue&lt;/a&gt; color that was darker than powder blue. The shade was replaced in 2017 with a return to Powderkeg Blue when UCLA switched to Under Armour as its apparel provider. In 2021, Nike and the Jordan Brand aligned the athletics blue with the university's UCLA Blue hue, which has been used by the school's academic and administrative units.\nVarsity sports.\nBaseball.\nThe 2010 team, under &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;head coach&lt;/a&gt; John Savage, won the Los Angeles Regional and Super-Regional, and was the first team to win 48 games in a season. The Bruins joined seven other teams in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20College%20World%20Series\"&gt;2010 College World Series&lt;/a&gt; and finished in second place, behind the University of South Carolina Gamecocks. The 2011 team won the &lt;a href=\"Pac-12%20Conference\"&gt;Pac-10 Conference&lt;/a&gt; title.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2013%20UCLA%20Bruins%20baseball%20team\"&gt;2013 team&lt;/a&gt; won UCLA's 109th NCAA Championship and their first in baseball in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20College%20World%20Series\"&gt;2013 College World Series&lt;/a&gt; by beating &lt;a href=\"2013%20Mississippi%20State%20Bulldogs%20baseball%20team\"&gt;Mississippi State&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131 and 8\u20130.\nMany UCLA baseball players have gone on to play in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB). In the &lt;a href=\"2009%20World%20Series\"&gt;2009 World Series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Utley\"&gt;Chase Utley&lt;/a&gt; hit two home runs to help the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt; win Game 1. There were a total of four former UCLA baseball players in the 2009 playoffs: Philadelphia's &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Francisco\"&gt;Ben Francisco&lt;/a&gt; and Chase Utley, Colorado's &lt;a href=\"Garrett%20Atkins\"&gt;Garrett Atkins&lt;/a&gt;, and St. Louis' &lt;a href=\"Troy%20Glaus\"&gt;Troy Glaus&lt;/a&gt;, who was the &lt;a href=\"2002%20World%20Series\"&gt;2002 World Series&lt;/a&gt; MVP for the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim\"&gt;Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Chambliss\"&gt;Chris Chambliss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gerrit%20Cole\"&gt;Gerrit Cole&lt;/a&gt; were No. 1 overall picks in the MLB drafts. &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Bauer\"&gt;Trevor Bauer&lt;/a&gt; was drafted as the No. 3 pick by the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt; on June 6, 2011. Former UCLA shortstop &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Crawford\"&gt;Brandon Crawford&lt;/a&gt; hit a grand-slam home run in his major-league debut with the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt; on May 27, 2011, and helped the Giants to win the &lt;a href=\"2012%20World%20Series\"&gt;2012 Major League World Series&lt;/a&gt;. Cole debuted with the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; by winning his first four games he pitched and also drove in two runs with a single in his first at-bat in the 2013 MLB season.\nBasketball (men).\nSeveral of the most revered championships were won by the Men's &lt;a href=\"Basketball\"&gt;Basketball&lt;/a&gt; team under coaches &lt;a href=\"John%20Wooden\"&gt;John Wooden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Harrick\"&gt;Jim Harrick&lt;/a&gt;. The rich legacy of UCLA basketball has produced 11 NCAA championships \u2013 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, and 1995. From 1971 to 1974, UCLA won 88 consecutive men's basketball games, an NCAA record for men. Recent &lt;a href=\"UConn%20Huskies\"&gt;UConn Huskies&lt;/a&gt; women's basketball teams have set overall NCAA basketball records with 90-game and (ongoing) 91-game winning streaks. The 35-year period (1940\u20131974) preceding and including the UCLA streak was characterized by less dynasties, however: 20 different men's teams won titles during that span. In comparison, the women's game to date has produced 35% less (tournament) parity, with 13 schools winning all 35 titles offered since its inception.\nPast rosters of UCLA basketball teams have included greats such as &lt;a href=\"Rafer%20Johnson\"&gt;Rafer Johnson&lt;/a&gt; who was the 1960 Olympic Decathlon Champion, &lt;a href=\"Gail%20Goodrich\"&gt;Gail Goodrich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar\"&gt;Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&lt;/a&gt; (then known as Lew Alcindor), &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Walton\"&gt;Bill Walton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reggie%20Miller\"&gt;Reggie Miller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Hazzard\"&gt;Walt Hazzard&lt;/a&gt;. The Bruins also had a winning record for 54 consecutive seasons from the 1948\u20131949 season to the 2001\u20132002 season.\nIn recent years, UCLA Men's Basketball was returned to prominence under Coach &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Howland\"&gt;Ben Howland&lt;/a&gt;. Between 2006 and 2008, UCLA has been to three consecutive Final Fours, while UCLA's players have received numerous awards, most notably &lt;a href=\"Arron%20Afflalo\"&gt;Arron Afflalo&lt;/a&gt;, a 2007 First-Team All American and the Pac-10 Player of the Year, and &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Love\"&gt;Kevin Love&lt;/a&gt;, a 2008 First-Team All American and the Pac-10 Player of the Year. UCLA has produced the most &lt;a href=\"NBA%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;NBA Most Valuable Player Award&lt;/a&gt; winners, six of them by Abdul-Jabbar and one by Walton, who was Abdul-Jabbar's successor.\nIn March 2013, UCLA relieved head men's basketball coach &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Howland\"&gt;Ben Howland&lt;/a&gt; of his duties after UCLA dropped an 83\u201363 decision to Minnesota in a second-round game of the NCAA Tournament. The current head coach is &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Cronin%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Mick Cronin&lt;/a&gt;, former head coach at &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasketball (women).\nIn the 1977\u201378 season, the women's basketball team, with a 27\u20132 record, were the AIAW Champions under head coach Billie Moore. The &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20UCLA%20Bruins%20women%27s%20basketball%20team\"&gt;2014\u201315 team&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Women%27s%20National%20Invitation%20Tournament\"&gt;2015 WNIT championship&lt;/a&gt; by defeating &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20women%27s%20basketball%20team\"&gt;the West Virginia Mountaineers&lt;/a&gt; 62\u201360 on April 4, 2015.\nWomen's beach volleyball.\nThe &lt;a href=\"UCLA%20Bruins%20women%27s%20beach%20volleyball\"&gt;UCLA Bruins women's beach volleyball&lt;/a&gt; team plays in the &lt;a href=\"Pac-12%20Conference\"&gt;Pac-12 Conference&lt;/a&gt;. UCLA launched its beach volleyball program in 2013.\nWomen's National Championships: 2018, 2019&lt;br&gt;\nThe beach volleyball team won its first national title on May 6, 2018, by defeating Hawaii and Florida State at Gulf Beach Place, Gulf Shores, Alabama. They repeated one year later on May 5, 2019, defeating rivals USC to win the National Championship.\nCross country.\nThe UCLA Bruins men's cross country team appeared in the NCAA Tournament thirteen times, with their highest finish being 5th place in the 1980\u201381 and 1981\u201382 school years. The UCLA Bruins women's cross country team appeared in the NCAA Tournament eleven times, with their highest finish being 6th place in the 1985\u201386 school year.\nFootball.\nIn 1954, the UCLA football team earned a share of the national title with a 9\u20130 record and a #1 ranking in the Coaches &lt;a href=\"UPI\"&gt;UPI&lt;/a&gt; football poll, while &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football\"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt; was ranked No. 1 in the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Poll\"&gt;AP Poll&lt;/a&gt;. Owing to rules in place at the time, UCLA was unable to face off against Ohio State in the Rose Bowl, which would have resulted in one or the other being declared national champion. The Bruins have played in the &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Bowl%20%28game%29\"&gt;Rose Bowl Game&lt;/a&gt; 12 times, winning 5 of them. The Bruins have won or shared the conference title 17 times. Among the many former UCLA football stars are &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Robinson\"&gt;Jackie Robinson&lt;/a&gt; (better known for his exploits as a baseball player, but nevertheless a 4-sport letterman and All-American), Heisman Trophy winner &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Beban\"&gt;Gary Beban&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Waterfield\"&gt;Bob Waterfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troy%20Aikman\"&gt;Troy Aikman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carnell%20Lake\"&gt;Carnell Lake&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Maddox\"&gt;Tommy Maddox&lt;/a&gt;. One of the great moments in recent history for the Bruins came on December 2, 2006, when they beat &lt;a href=\"2006%20USC%20Trojans%20football%20team\"&gt;USC&lt;/a&gt; 13\u20139 in one of the greatest upsets in the rivalry. The Bruins are the &lt;a href=\"Pac-12%20Conference\"&gt;Pac-12 Conference&lt;/a&gt; South Division Champions for two years in a row and played in both the 2011 and 2012 &lt;a href=\"Pac-12%20Football%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;Pac-12 Football Championship Game&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUCLA became the first school to have a top winner in both basketball and football in the same year with &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Beban\"&gt;Gary Beban&lt;/a&gt; winning the Heisman Trophy and &lt;a href=\"Lew%20Alcindor\"&gt;Lew Alcindor&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar\"&gt;Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&lt;/a&gt;) winning the &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Robertson%20Trophy\"&gt;U.S. Basketball Writers Association&lt;/a&gt; player of the year award in 1968.\n15 football players and coaches have been inducted into the &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;College Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;, John Sciarra being the latest inductee in the Class of 2014. A notable player and alumnus of the UCLA football team is current \"&lt;a href=\"NCIS%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;NCIS&lt;/a&gt;\" star, actor &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Harmon\"&gt;Mark Harmon&lt;/a&gt;. Winner of the \"all-around excellence\" award, Harmon led his team to victory several times as the quarterback.\nThe current head coach is &lt;a href=\"Chip%20Kelly\"&gt;Chip Kelly&lt;/a&gt;. Kelly was hired on November 25, 2017.\nThe UCLA Bruins men's football team have an NCAA Division I FBS Tournament record of 16\u201319\u20131 through thirty-six appearances.\nGolf.\nThe UCLA Bruins men's golf team has won two &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Golf%20Championships\"&gt;NCAA Championships&lt;/a&gt;, in 1988 and &lt;a href=\"2008%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Golf%20Championship\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. In the 2008 national championship, the team was led by senior &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Chappell\"&gt;Kevin Chappell&lt;/a&gt;, who won the respective individual title. In that championship, UCLA won by one shot over USC, and by two shots over Stanford. In 2009, UCLA came first in the NCAA Central Regional, pulling off their third regional championship in the last seven years. With that victory, the defending national champions, advanced to their seventh consecutive NCAA Championship, a school record. For &lt;a href=\"2011%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Golf%20Championship\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;, the Bruins were first in stroke play before losing in the match play of the national championship tournament; and freshman golfer &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Cantlay\"&gt;Patrick Cantlay&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Golf%20Coaches%20Association%20of%20America\"&gt;GCAA&lt;/a&gt; Division I &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Nicklaus\"&gt;Jack Nicklaus&lt;/a&gt; National Player of the Year Award, the fourth player from UCLA. Cantlay was also the National Freshman of the Year, winning the &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Mickelson\"&gt;Phil Mickelson&lt;/a&gt; Award in addition to being the &lt;a href=\"Pac-12%20Conference\"&gt;Pac-10&lt;/a&gt; Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year.

At the &lt;a href=\"2011%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;2011 U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt;, Chappell was the low American (tie with &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Garrigus\"&gt;Robert Garrigus&lt;/a&gt;) and Cantlay was the low amateur. The team has won five Pac-12 Conference championships: 1982, 1983, 1985, 2003, 2006 and has had numerous individual conference champions the first of which was Peter Laszlo in 1970.\nThe women's team won the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Women%27s%20Golf%20Championship\"&gt;national championship&lt;/a&gt; in 1971 (&lt;a href=\"AIAW%20Champions%23Golf\"&gt;DGWS&lt;/a&gt;), 1991, 2004 and 2011.

badminton&lt;/a&gt; team won three national championships in 1977, 1981 and 1982. The 1977 squad was led by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Kinard\"&gt;Chris Kinard&lt;/a&gt;, multiple winner of the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20National%20Badminton%20Championships\"&gt;U.S. Men's Singles Championship&lt;/a&gt; before and during his career at UCLA. Kinard is a member of the U.S. Badminton Hall of Fame.\nThe women's varsity badminton team also won the &lt;a href=\"AIAW\"&gt;AIAW&lt;/a&gt; intercollegiate championship in 1977.\nBoxing.\nThe men's and women's boxing teams have competed as part of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Boxing%20Association\"&gt;National Collegiate Boxing Association&lt;/a&gt; since 2016, after switching from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Intercollegiate%20Boxing%20Association\"&gt;United States Intercollegiate Boxing Association&lt;/a&gt;. The women's team has earned three individual national boxing titles: one from the USIBA in 2014, and two from the NCBA, in 2016 and 2019.\nRugby.\nFounded in 1934, UCLA rugby is one of the historically great &lt;a href=\"college%20rugby\"&gt;college rugby&lt;/a&gt; teams. UCLA won 3 national championships, and amassed a 362\u201346\u20132 record from 1966 to 1982, but the program lost its varsity status in 1982. The Bruins play Division 1 college rugby in the &lt;a href=\"PAC%20Rugby%20Conference\"&gt;PAC Rugby Conference&lt;/a&gt;. The Bruins are led by head coach Scott Stewart, who formerly played international rugby for Canada. The team plays its home games at &lt;a href=\"North%20Athletic%20Field\"&gt;North Athletic Field&lt;/a&gt;.\nUCLA rugby has been steadily improving in recent years. UCLA finished the 2010\u201311 season ranked 25th in the country. In the 2011\u201312 season UCLA placed second in the Pacific Conference, reached the quarterfinals of the 2012 men's national playoffs, and finished the season ranked 11th in the nation. During the 2012\u201313 season, UCLA finished second in the &lt;a href=\"PAC%20Rugby%20Conference\"&gt;PAC conference&lt;/a&gt;, highlighted by a 50\u201338 win over 6th-ranked Utah, which propelled UCLA into a top-10 position in the national rankings. UCLA \u2013 along with fellow PAC schools Cal and Utah \u2013 was one of the original eight teams to form the &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20Cup%20Championship\"&gt;Varsity Cup&lt;/a&gt;, which began play in 2013. UCLA reached the quarterfinals of the 2015 Varsity Cup, before losing to eventual champions BYU.\nUCLA has also been successful in rugby sevens. UCLA reached the quarterfinals of the 2012 Las Vegas Invitational college rugby sevens tournament. UCLA defeated Arizona State to finish third at the 2012 PAC 7s tournament. UCLA defeated Dartmouth to reach the semifinals of the 2013 &lt;a href=\"Collegiate%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;Collegiate Rugby Championship&lt;/a&gt; at PPL Park in Philadelphia in a tournament broadcast live on NBC. UCLA again reached the semifinals of the 2014 Collegiate Rugby Championship, before losing, 17\u201320, to eventual champions Cal. UCLA won the 2014 West Coast 7s with a 14\u201312 upset victory over Cal in the final.\nAthletics facilities.\nIn 2014, UCLA named all of its recreation and athletics facilities in honor of &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Robinson\"&gt;Jackie Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, who was a four-sport student-athlete at the school and went on to play &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; as the first African American to do so in the league. The Jackie Robinson \"42\" Athletics and Recreation Complex monument was installed in front of the John Wooden Recreation Center and was unveiled on March 5, 2016. The school also retired number 42 which was the number Robinson worn as a member of the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers\"&gt;Brooklyn Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo notable sports facilities serve as home venues for UCLA sports. Since 1982, the Bruin football team has played home games at the &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Bowl%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pasadena%2C%20California\"&gt;Pasadena, California&lt;/a&gt;. From 1923 to 1981, including the Bruins' 1954 National Championship year, the team played at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Memorial%20Coliseum\"&gt;Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles. The men's and women's basketball, women's gymnastics and volleyball teams play at &lt;a href=\"Pauley%20Pavilion\"&gt;Pauley Pavilion&lt;/a&gt; on campus. The softball team plays on campus at &lt;a href=\"Easton%20Stadium\"&gt;Easton Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Down the hill, the water polo teams, as well as the swim and dive teams, compete at &lt;a href=\"Spieker%20Aquatics%20Center\"&gt;Spieker Aquatics Center&lt;/a&gt;. For baseball, there is the Steele Field at &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Robinson%20Stadium\"&gt;Jackie Robinson Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, located close to campus.\nSee also: &lt;a href=\"Bel-Air%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Bel-Air Country Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drake%20Stadium%20%28UCLA%29\"&gt;Drake Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Tennis%20Center\"&gt;Los Angeles Tennis Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Canyon%20Recreation%20Center\"&gt;Sunset Canyon Recreation Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UCLA%20Marina%20Aquatic%20Center\"&gt;UCLA Marina Aquatic Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wallis%20Annenberg%20Stadium\"&gt;Wallis Annenberg Stadium&lt;/a&gt;\nAthletic alumni.\n&lt;a href=\"Mark%20Harmon\"&gt;Mark Harmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lynn%20Compton\"&gt;Lynn \"Buck\" Compton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Robinson\"&gt;Jackie Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rafer%20Johnson\"&gt;Rafer Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Hazzard\"&gt;Walt Hazzard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gail%20Goodrich\"&gt;Gail Goodrich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troy%20Aikman\"&gt;Troy Aikman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Beban\"&gt;Gary Beban&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Easley\"&gt;Kenny Easley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Fears\"&gt;Tom Fears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Kilmer\"&gt;Billy Kilmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Waterfield\"&gt;Bob Waterfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Connors\"&gt;Jimmy Connors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lonzo%20Ball\"&gt;Lonzo Ball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar\"&gt;Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&lt;/a&gt; (Lew Alcindor), &lt;a href=\"Jamaal%20Wilkes\"&gt;Jamaal Wilkes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Joyner-Kersee\"&gt;Jackie Joyner-Kersee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evelyn%20Ashford\"&gt;Evelyn Ashford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Walton\"&gt;Bill Walton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Washington%20%28football%20player%29\"&gt;Kenny Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Ashe\"&gt;Arthur Ashe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reggie%20Miller\"&gt;Reggie Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troy%20Glaus\"&gt;Troy Glaus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Daggett\"&gt;Tim Daggett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Davis\"&gt;Baron Davis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stacey%20Nuveman\"&gt;Stacey Nuveman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lisa%20Fernandez\"&gt;Lisa Fernandez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20Freed\"&gt;Amanda Freed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Love\"&gt;Kevin Love&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tairia%20Flowers\"&gt;Tairia Flowers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Donna%20de%20Varona\"&gt;Donna de Varona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Westbrook\"&gt;Russell Westbrook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cobi%20Jones\"&gt;Cobi Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lauren%20Cheney\"&gt;Lauren Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Leroux\"&gt;Sydney Leroux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ann%20Meyers\"&gt;Ann Meyers&lt;/a&gt; are just some of the notable athletic alumni, many of whom have achieved success in other fields.\nFormer coaches have included &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Russell%20Sanders\"&gt;Red Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Prothro\"&gt;Tommy Prothro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Vermeil\"&gt;Dick Vermeil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Donahue\"&gt;Terry Donahue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Al%20Scates\"&gt;Al Scates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Krikorian\"&gt;Adam Krikorian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Bornstein\"&gt;Jonathan Bornstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Banachowski\"&gt;Andy Banachowski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Harrick\"&gt;Jim Harrick&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"John%20Wooden\"&gt;John Wooden&lt;/a&gt;.\nOlympic competitors.\nIn addition to the success of its collegiate sports program, UCLA has been represented at the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Olympics\"&gt;2004 Athens games&lt;/a&gt;, UCLA sent 56 athletes, more than any other university in the country. At the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Beijing%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;2008 Beijing Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;, Bruins won 15 medals, including 4 gold, 9 silver, and 2 bronze. Additionally, five coaches came from UCLA: &lt;a href=\"Jill%20Ellis\"&gt;Jill Ellis&lt;/a&gt; (women's soccer, gold), &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Baker\"&gt;Guy Baker&lt;/a&gt; (women's water polo, silver), &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Alejo\"&gt;Bob Alejo&lt;/a&gt; (men's beach volleyball, gold), &lt;a href=\"Jeannette%20Boldon\"&gt;Jeannette Boldon&lt;/a&gt; (women's track and field, multiple medals), and &lt;a href=\"John%20Speraw\"&gt;John Speraw&lt;/a&gt; (men's volleyball, gold).\nSymbolism.\nThe Bruin &lt;a href=\"mascots\"&gt;mascots&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Bruin\"&gt;Joe and Josephine Bruin&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to regular attendance at UCLA sporting events, the duo participates in other events for the university.\nOn September 30, 1984, the UCLA Alumni Association celebrated its 50th anniversary by installing \"The Bruin\" statue in Bruin Plaza. It was billed as the largest bear sculpture in the United States, at 10 feet long, 6 feet wide, 3 feet across and weighing more than 2 tons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"UCLA%20Bruin%20Marching%20Band\"&gt;Solid Gold Sound of the UCLA Bruin Marching Band&lt;/a&gt; entertains crowds at major athletic and extracurricular events. The school &lt;a href=\"fight%20songs\"&gt;fight songs&lt;/a&gt; are \"&lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Westwood\"&gt;Sons of Westwood&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Mighty%20Bruins\"&gt;The Mighty Bruins&lt;/a&gt;.\" The spirit squad includes the cheer squad, the dance team and the yell crew, in addition to the mascots. The UCLA alumni band is the official band of the gymnastics team at the school.\nRivalries.\nUCLA shares a traditional sports rivalry with the nearby &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20California\"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; (USC). This rivalry is relatively unique in &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; Division I sports because both schools are located within the same city, Los Angeles. The &lt;a href=\"Lexus%20Gauntlet\"&gt;Lexus Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt; was the name given to a now defunct competition between UCLA and USC in the 18 varsity sports that both competed in head-to-head; in 2003, 2005, and 2007 UCLA won the Lexus Gauntlet Trophy, while the University of Southern California won the trophy in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2009. Competitions with official sponsorship were held from 2001 until the licensing contract ended in 2009. The annual football game features both teams vying for the &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Bell%20%28UCLA%E2%80%93USC%29\"&gt;Victory Bell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"California%20Golden%20Bears%20football\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and UCLA have met annually on the football field since 1939. Because UCLA was founded as the southern branch of the University of California, the series takes on the quality of a sibling rivalry. The series was dominated early by Cal, followed by dominance by UCLA in the 1950s until 80s, and has become more evenly matched recently.\nUCLA had a basketball rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;, with games played every year from 1966 to 1995. After UCLA's victory on February 7, 2009, UCLA leads the all-time series, 28\u201319.\nThe performance of UCLA and Arizona influences the national opinion of the conference.\nUCLA Athletics Hall of Fame.\nIn conjunction with the opening of the J.D. Morgan Athletics Center in November 1983, UCLA established an athletics Hall of Fame with 25 charter members representing a cross-section of the school's athletic history. Each year, a minimum of one and a maximum of eight former UCLA athletes, coaches or administrators are added to the Hall of Fame. Upon its 23rd year of existence, The Hall of Fame was moved to a new location facing Westwood Plaza. The new Hall of Fame is now double in size after its renovation and expansion, which was completed in the Winter of 2000. The first floor in the east wing of the new J.D. Morgan Athletics Center features the Athletics Hall of Fame and serves as the main entrance to the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics.\nAthletics apparel sponsorships.\nFrom 1993 to 1999 the school had an apparel contract with &lt;a href=\"Reebok\"&gt;Reebok&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1999, an agreement was reached with &lt;a href=\"Adidas\"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt; for six years, ending in June 2005. The deal was to provide equipment and apparel to UCLA's 21 intercollegiate teams. Additional terms of the deal included internship opportunities for UCLA students and an exclusive licensee for athletic replica wear. The reported monetary terms of the agreement included $1.625 million in cash and $1.3 million in equipment each year.\nIn 2005, the deal was renewed for $2.6 million in cash and $1.6 million in equipment. Additional terms included one full-time Adidas employee on the UCLA campus, $2,500 each year for a \"non-UCLA charitable\" project selected by the Football or Basketball head coach, game tickets for Adidas executives, radio acknowledgements during games, and appearances by the Football and Basketball head coaches at Adidas events.\nIn April 2010, a letter of intent to renew was reached between UCLA Athletics and Adidas. By June of that same year the terms of the deal were finalized but not published. In a report, UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero stated that the deal is for seven years and \"will approach\" the deal Adidas has with Michigan worth $7.5 million.\nIn May 2016, UCLA signed a 15-year, $280 million deal with sportswear manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Under%20Armour\"&gt;Under Armour&lt;/a&gt; starting in the 2017\u201318 season. In June 2020, Under Armour announced that it will be terminating its apparel deal with UCLA.\nIn December 2020, UCLA signed a 6-year deal with the &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Brand\"&gt;Jordan Brand&lt;/a&gt; to outfit the football and men's and women's basketball teams. Starting July 1, 2021, Nike also outfits the other 25 varsity sports teams at UCLA."
