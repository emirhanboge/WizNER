He played at club level for &lt;a href=\"Keighley%20Cougars\"&gt;Keighley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Bulls\"&gt;Bradford Northern&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Bradford%20Bulls%20players\"&gt;Heritage \u2116&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"York%20Wasps\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hunslet%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Hunslet&lt;/a&gt;, as a , and coached at club level for &lt;a href=\"Keighley%20Cougars\"&gt;Keighley&lt;/a&gt; (three spells), &lt;a href=\"Halifax%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Raiders\"&gt;Barrow&lt;/a&gt; (two spells), &lt;a href=\"Swinton%20Lions\"&gt;Swinton&lt;/a&gt; (two spells), &lt;a href=\"Featherstone%20Rovers\"&gt;Featherstone Rovers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wakefield%20Trinity\"&gt;Wakefield Trinity&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nRoe began his career at &lt;a href=\"Oakbank%20School%2C%20Keighley\"&gt;Oakbank School&lt;/a&gt; and when they did not have a fixture he was drafted in to play for the Keighley rugby union colts. However at the same time on a Sunday Roe played his first love rugby league for the Keighley junior supporters club so effectively played two to three games of rugby a week including playing Wednesday afternoons for the first XV. Also at the same Roe had been courted by &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt; as during his time at the age of 15 been captain and centre-half of a successful Keighley boys soccer team. However a fall from a tree whilst living on a farm after his father's early death curtailed any sporting activity for 12-months due to a bad back injury. Roe turned his back on soccer and whilst working as a laboratory technician signed professional forms for &lt;a href=\"Keighley%20Cougars\"&gt;Keighley RLFC&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 17. Whilst at Keighley he became one of the youngest ever to represent &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20League%20War%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; County. On 30 December 1975 Roe was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Bulls\"&gt;Bradford Northern&lt;/a&gt;, where he played 99 games under &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Francis%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;Roy Francis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Fox%20%28rugby%20league%2C%20born%201933%29\"&gt;Peter Fox&lt;/a&gt; who, coached the team to back-to-back championships. His playing position was at . Roe was selected to play for &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; in France but had to pull out due to a serious knee injury and subsequently had to retire prematurely from the game when Bradford Northern cashed in their insurance policy (\u00a330,000) on Roe in 1981. Roe proved the medical people wrong and fought his way back to fitness but was not allowed to play again for Bradford Northern due to the legalities of the payout.\nBy his own admission Roe admitted that this was the low point of his life and went from potential tourist in 1979 go the forgotten man of rugby league. Also by his own admission although continuing to play with &lt;a href=\"York%20Wasps\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hunslet%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Hunslet&lt;/a&gt; he had lost that vital yard of pace which was vital at the top level of the sport.\nCoaching career.\nHe began his coaching career at Keighley, taking over from the late &lt;a href=\"Geoff%20Peggs\"&gt;Geoff Peggs&lt;/a&gt; who 'died in office' in 1985. He left the following year.\nPeter Roe was appointed as head coach at &lt;a href=\"Halifax%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; for season 1990-91 when they achieved promotion along with &lt;a href=\"Salford%20Red%20Devils\"&gt;Salford&lt;/a&gt; who were their opponents in the Divisional Final at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;. Roe was removed from office 24-hours later when he refused to re-apply for his own job. The Halifax board stated that he did not have the required experience for a club in the top division. He returned to Keighley in September 1991 and coached the club to the division three title in 1992-93 and stayed at his home town club until 1994.\nHe was coach of &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Raiders\"&gt;Barrow&lt;/a&gt; for a 15-month period, ending in January 1996.\nPeter Roe led &lt;a href=\"Swinton%20Lions\"&gt;Swinton&lt;/a&gt; to promotion from Division Two in 1996.\nPeter Roe was in charge of &lt;a href=\"Featherstone%20Rovers\"&gt;Featherstone Rovers&lt;/a&gt; from 1999 to October 2001 on a part-time contract, before leaving to take charge of &lt;a href=\"Wakefield%20Trinity\"&gt;Wakefield Trinity&lt;/a&gt;. He was replaced at Featherstone Rovers by his assistant &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Fairhurst\"&gt;Ian Fairhurst&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn October 2001, Roe left his part-time role as &lt;a href=\"Featherstone%20Rovers\"&gt;Featherstone Rovers&lt;/a&gt; coach and his job as a benefit fraud investigator to take up a full-time head coach post with &lt;a href=\"Wakefield%20Trinity\"&gt;Wakefield Trinity&lt;/a&gt;. He was sacked in July 2002 and was replaced by his assistant &lt;a href=\"Shane%20McNally\"&gt;Shane McNally&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeter Roe quit as coach of &lt;a href=\"Swinton%20Lions\"&gt;Swinton&lt;/a&gt; in September 2003, after less than a year in charge.\nIn Peter Roe's second spell with &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Raiders\"&gt;Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, they were &lt;a href=\"RFL%20League%201\"&gt;National League Two&lt;/a&gt; champions in 2004, their first trophy for 20 years with 14 wins from their 18 games. Roe won Coach of the Year in the process. They were promoted to &lt;a href=\"RFL%20Championship\"&gt;National League One&lt;/a&gt; but were relegated back to &lt;a href=\"RFL%20League%201\"&gt;National League Two&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 2005 season after winning just one of their 18 matches. The financial situation at the club forced a review of the coaching structure and the position of head coach was made part-time and the club parted company with Peter Roe.\nPeter Roe returned for his second spell in charge of &lt;a href=\"Keighley%20Cougars\"&gt;Keighley&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2005, succeeding Gary Moorby and starting the rebuilding process of a club still ravaged by relegation from &lt;a href=\"RFL%20Championship\"&gt;National League One&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of players had left and money was in short supply. &lt;a href=\"player-coach\"&gt;player-coach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Eaton\"&gt;Barry Eaton&lt;/a&gt; was the only major signing and promising youngsters were blooded; the side struggled to compete and they finished joint-bottom. Roe gave Eaton full control as &lt;a href=\"player-coach\"&gt;player-coach&lt;/a&gt; in 2007."
