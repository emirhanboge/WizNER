    "text": "HMS \"Aeolus\" was a 32-gun &lt;a href=\"Amphion%20class%20frigate\"&gt;\"Amphion\"-class&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fifth-rate\"&gt;fifth-rate&lt;/a&gt; frigate of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;. She was launched in 1801 and served in the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolutionary%20Wars\"&gt;French Revolutionary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrdered during the last years of the French Revolutionary Wars, \"Aeolus\" was at first engaged in convoy work, before being sent out to the &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies\"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;, where she took part in operations off &lt;a href=\"Saint-Domingue\"&gt;Saint-Domingue&lt;/a&gt; and blockaded the French ships in the harbours. She was involved in the chase of the 74-gun &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Duquesne%20%281787%29\"&gt;\"Duquesne\"&lt;/a&gt; after she put to sea, and assisted in her capture. \"Aeolus\" returned to operate off the British coast, and was part of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Richard%20Strachan%2C%206th%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir Richard Strachan's&lt;/a&gt; squadron in late 1805. The squadron encountered part of the fleeing Franco-Spanish fleet that &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson\"&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt; had decisively defeated two weeks previously at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Trafalgar\"&gt;Battle of Trafalgar&lt;/a&gt;, and after bringing them to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cape%20Ortegal\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt;, captured the entire force.\nAfter spending time off Ireland and North America, \"Aeolus\" was in the Caribbean in 1809, and took part in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Martinique%20%281809%29\"&gt;capture of Martinique&lt;/a&gt;. Deployed with Captain &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Broke\"&gt;Philip Broke&lt;/a&gt;'s squadron after the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt; \"Aeolus\" took part in the capture of , the first ship either side lost in the war, the pursuit of and the capture of the American &lt;a href=\"privateer\"&gt;privateer&lt;/a&gt; \"Snapper\". \"Aeolus\" was used as a &lt;a href=\"storeship\"&gt;storeship&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; after the end of the war, and after returning to Britain was laid up as the Napoleonic Wars drew to a close. She was finally sold in 1817.\nConstruction and commissioning.\n\"Aeolus\" was ordered on 28 January 1800 from the yards of Mrs Frances Barnard, of &lt;a href=\"Deptford\"&gt;Deptford&lt;/a&gt;, and built to a design by Sir William Rule. She was laid down in April 1800 and launched on 28 February 1801. \"Aeolus\" commissioned under her first commander, Captain &lt;a href=\"John%20William%20Spranger\"&gt;John Spranger&lt;/a&gt; in March 1801.\nShe was the third ship in the Navy to be named \"Aeolus\". The first, also a 32-gun fifth rate (launched in 1758), was still in existence but had been reduced to harbour service in 1796 and renamed \"Guernsey\" in 1800 to free the name for the new ship. Then a squadron captured the French frigate \"Pallas\", which received the name \"Aeolus\". In the meantime, \"Guernsey\" was sold in May 1801, shortly after the third \"Aeolus\" had completed fitting out the previous month, at &lt;a href=\"Deptford%20Dockyard\"&gt;Deptford Dockyard&lt;/a&gt;. The second \"Aeolus\" was then renamed to \"Pique\".\nCareer.\nWest Indies.\n\"Aeolus\" was at first employed on convoy duties and sailed to &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; in January 1802. In August she was briefly under the command of Lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Whitby\"&gt;Henry Whitby&lt;/a&gt;, in an acting capacity, but Spranger was not superseded until Captain Andrew Evans took over in May 1803.\nOn 1 February 1804 she captured the American &lt;a href=\"Snow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; \"Antelope\", of 155 tons. \"Antelope\" had a crew of eight men and was carrying provisions, dry goods, wine, staves, hoops and sundries. In May 1804 &lt;a href=\"Lord%20William%20FitzRoy\"&gt;Lord William FitzRoy&lt;/a&gt; assumed command.\n\"Aeolus\" joined Commodore &lt;a href=\"John%20Loring%20%28d.%201808%29\"&gt;John Loring's&lt;/a&gt; squadron off &lt;a href=\"Saint-Domingue\"&gt;Saint-Domingue&lt;/a&gt; following the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Saint-Domingue%20expedition\"&gt;French forces there&lt;/a&gt;, and still serving with Loring, took part in the capture of the French 74-gun &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Duquesne%20%281787%29\"&gt;\"Duquesne\"&lt;/a&gt; off Saint-Domingue on 25 July 1804. The French ship, under Commodore &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Maurice%20Julien%20de%20Qu%C3%A9rangal\"&gt;Qu\u00e9rangal&lt;/a&gt;, had been trapped at &lt;a href=\"Cap-Ha%C3%AFtien\"&gt;Cape Francois&lt;/a&gt; by a British blockade, along with the 74-gun &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Implacable%20%281805%29\"&gt;\"Duguay-Trouin\"&lt;/a&gt;, under Captain &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Touffet\"&gt;Claude Touffet&lt;/a&gt;, and the 40-gun &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Guerriere%20%281806%29\"&gt;\"Guerriere\"&lt;/a&gt;, under Captain Beaudouin. The squadron escaped to sea under cover of squalls on the afternoon of 24 July, and split up, \"Duguay-Trouin\" and \"Guerriere\" heading east pursued by Captain George Dundas in , and \"Duquesne\" heading west followed by Loring in and accompanied by HMS \"Aeolus\" and . and soon joined the chase. \"Duquesne\", unable to escape, &lt;a href=\"striking%20the%20colours\"&gt;struck her colours&lt;/a&gt; to Captain &lt;a href=\"James%20Walker%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29\"&gt;James Walker&lt;/a&gt; of \"Vanguard\".\nCape Ortegal.\n\"Aeolus\" was then assigned to operate in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Channel\"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt;. By late 1805 she was part of Captain &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Richard%20Strachan%2C%206th%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir Richard Strachan's&lt;/a&gt; squadron patrolling in &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Biscay\"&gt;Bay of Biscay&lt;/a&gt;. Strachan, with his pennant aboard the 80-gun &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Caesar%20%281793%29\"&gt;\"Caesar\"&lt;/a&gt;, had the 74-gun ships &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Hero%20%281803%29\"&gt;\"Hero\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Courageux%20%281800%29\"&gt;\"Courageux\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Namur%20%281756%29\"&gt;\"Namur\"&lt;/a&gt; and , the 36-gun &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Santa%20Margarita%20%281779%29\"&gt;\"Santa Margarita\"&lt;/a&gt; and \"Aeolus\". They were searching for a French squadron under Zacharie Allemand which was known to be &lt;a href=\"Allemand%27s%20expedition%20of%201805\"&gt;cruising in the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;, when they were joined late on 3 November by the 36-gun , under Captain &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Baker%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29\"&gt;Thomas Baker&lt;/a&gt;. Baker reported that he had just escaped from a French squadron of four large ships, and Strachan immediately set off in pursuit. Though they were thought to be part of Allemand's squadron, they were in fact four ships which had escaped the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Trafalgar\"&gt;Battle of Trafalgar&lt;/a&gt; under Rear-Admiral &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Dumanoir%20le%20Pelley\"&gt;Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley&lt;/a&gt;, and were now hurrying north to reach &lt;a href=\"Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime\"&gt;Rochefort&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn realising that he had encountered a superior British force, Pelley attempted to flee northwards, but his ships were steadily overhauled by the British, with Strachan sending the faster frigates on to wear down the rear-most ships. \"Aeolus\" joined them in attacking the &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Scipion%20%281798%29\"&gt;\"Scipion\"&lt;/a&gt;, and as the ships of the line came up and Pelley came about to engage them, the frigates formed up on the Frenchmen's starboard side, doubling their line. The French were worn down and all four ships were forced to surrender. \"Aeolus\" had no men killed during the engagement, and only three wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"4 Novr. 1805\" to all surviving claimants from the action.\nIrish station and America.\n\"Aeolus\" spent the rest of 1805 and 1806 on the Irish station, before departing for &lt;a href=\"Halifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; in August 1807. She was then in the Caribbean, taking part in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Martinique%20%281809%29\"&gt;capture of Martinique&lt;/a&gt; in February 1809. She formed part of a small squadron with &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Cleopatra%20%281779%29\"&gt;HMS \"Cleopatra\"&lt;/a&gt; and the brig &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Recruit%20%281806%29\"&gt;HMS \"Recruit\"&lt;/a&gt;, which was sent into &lt;a href=\"Fort-de-France%20Bay\"&gt;Fort-de-France Bay&lt;/a&gt; on 5 February. Panicked by the advance the French militia defending the bay set fire to the ships anchored there, including the frigate &lt;a href=\"French%20frigate%20Amphitrite%20%281808%29\"&gt;\"Amphitrite\"&lt;/a&gt;, and abandoned the forts in the southern part of the island. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"Martinique\" to all surviving claimants from the campaign.\nAfter five years in command of \"Aeolus\" Fitzroy handed over command to Captain &lt;a href=\"John%20Shortland\"&gt;John Shortland&lt;/a&gt; in October 1809. Captain &lt;a href=\"Lord%20James%20Townshend\"&gt;Lord James Townshend&lt;/a&gt; succeeded Shortland in December 1810. Serving aboard \"Aeolus\" in 1811 was &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Marryat\"&gt;Frederick Marryat&lt;/a&gt;, who would later become famous as an author.\nWar of 1812.\nWith the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt; \"Aeolus\" was sent to join Captain &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Broke\"&gt;Philip Broke&lt;/a&gt;'s squadron in July 1812, and was present at the capture of the 14-gun on 15 July. The British squadron, consisting of \"Aeolus\", the 64-gun under Captain &lt;a href=\"John%20Bastard%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29\"&gt;John Bastard&lt;/a&gt;, Broke's 38-gun , the 38-gun under Captain &lt;a href=\"James%20Richard%20Dacres%20%281788%E2%80%931853%29\"&gt;James Richard Dacres&lt;/a&gt; and the 36-gun under Captain &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Byron%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29\"&gt;Richard Byron&lt;/a&gt;, had arrived off &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; in search of , then under Commodore &lt;a href=\"John%20Rodgers%20%28naval%20officer%2C%20War%20of%201812%29\"&gt;John Rodgers&lt;/a&gt;, but she had already sailed.\nInstead, the British found the \"Nautilus\", under &lt;a href=\"William%20M.%20Crane\"&gt;William M. Crane&lt;/a&gt;. \"Nautilus\" was unable to outrun the British squadron and surrendered, becoming the first ship either side lost during the war. Shortly afterwards the squadron fell in with and chased her for three days, with the American ship resorting to throwing her water and stores overboard, and having the ship towed and kedged, before she finally managed to escape.\nOn 3 November 1812 \"Aeolus\", acting in company with , and captured the American &lt;a href=\"privateer\"&gt;privateer&lt;/a&gt; \"Snapper\". \"Snapper\", of 172 or 200 tons (accounts vary), was out of Philadelphia and was armed with ten guns. The American press reported that before she struck she took 800 shots to her hulls and sails.\nOn 7 August 1812 \"Aeolus\" captured and burnt the American ship \"Pomona\". \"Pomona\" had been sailing from &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; to an American port.\nBetween February and March 1813, \"Aeolus\" captured several American merchant ships, and one Spaniard, that she sent in to Bermuda:\nAt some point after these captures command of \"Aeolus\" passed to Captain Joseph Popham in 1813, and he was succeeded in an acting capacity by Commander James Crighton the following year.\nFate.\n\"Aelous\" was sent to &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a &lt;a href=\"storeship\"&gt;storeship&lt;/a&gt;, and returned to Britain to be laid up at &lt;a href=\"Woolwich\"&gt;Woolwich&lt;/a&gt; in August 1814. She was moved to Deptford in June 1816, and was broken up there in October 1817."
