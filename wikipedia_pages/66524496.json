    "text": "The Cal 2-24, also called the Cal 24-2 and the Cal 24 Mark II is an American &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20sailer\"&gt;trailerable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt; that was designed by &lt;a href=\"C.%20William%20Lapworth\"&gt;C. William Lapworth&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Sailing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;racer&lt;/a&gt; and first built in 1967.\nThe boat was an entirely new design to replace the original Lapworth-designed &lt;a href=\"Cal%2024\"&gt;Cal 24&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cal%20Yachts\"&gt;Cal Yachts&lt;/a&gt; product line.\nThe design was officially marketed by the manufacturer as the Cal 24, but was later marketed as the Cal 2-24 to differentiate it from the unrelated 1958 Lapworth &lt;a href=\"Cal%2024\"&gt;Cal 24&lt;/a&gt; design and the 1983 &lt;a href=\"C.%20Raymond%20Hunt%20Associates\"&gt;C. Raymond Hunt Associates&lt;/a&gt;-designed &lt;a href=\"Cal%203-24\"&gt;Cal 3-24&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of their market introduction each of these designs was sold under the designation of Cal 24.\nProduction.\nThe design was built by Cal Yachts in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, from 1967 to 1971 with 185 boats completed, but it is now out of production.\nDesign.\nThe boat incorporated what Lapworth called his \"finer-bow\", which he thought gave it an advantage in windward sailing in waves.\nThe Cal 24 is a racing &lt;a href=\"keelboat\"&gt;keelboat&lt;/a&gt;, built predominantly of &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt;, with wood trim. It has a &lt;a href=\"Fractional%20rig\"&gt;fractional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sloop\"&gt;sloop&lt;/a&gt; rig; a spooned, &lt;a href=\"raked%20stem\"&gt;raked stem&lt;/a&gt;; a raised counter, slightly angled &lt;a href=\"Transom%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;transom&lt;/a&gt;; a spade-type &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"tiller\"&gt;tiller&lt;/a&gt; and a fixed, swept, fin keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of with the standard keel.\nThe boat is normally fitted with a small &lt;a href=\"outboard%20motor\"&gt;outboard motor&lt;/a&gt; for docking and maneuvering.\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin and two straight settee quarter berths in the main cabin. The &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is located just aft of bow \"V\"-berth on the port side. Cabin headroom is .\nThe design has a &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Handicap%20Racing%20Fleet\"&gt;PHRF&lt;/a&gt; racing average handicap of 228 and a &lt;a href=\"hull%20speed\"&gt;hull speed&lt;/a&gt; of .\nOperational history.\nIn a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, \"The raised deck on the Cal 24-2 (sometimes called the Cal 2-24 by her marketers, and by others sometimes called the Cal 24 Mk II) provides an uncluttered foredeck, and though\nraised decks tend to increase headroom below, in this case they don't, as the headroom at 4' 0\" is worst among the Cal's comp[etitor]s. Unlike her comp[etitor]s, the focus of the Cal 24-2's design was mainly on racing, and it shows in her PHRF rating, her lack of galley amenities, and her underbody form. Her fin keel and spade rudder give her a greater ability to maneuver at the starting line and turn quickly at marks, but prevent her from attaining the easy-steering straight-line stability of her more cruising-oriented long-\nkeel comps. Best features: The Cal 24-2 has a presentable PHRF rating of 228, best of her comp[etitor]s and in line with her &lt;a href=\"Cal%2024-1\"&gt;Cal 24-1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cal%2024-3\"&gt;Cal 24-3&lt;/a&gt; sisters, as well as other boats as varied as the &lt;a href=\"Neptune%2024\"&gt;Neptune 24&lt;/a&gt; ...\""
