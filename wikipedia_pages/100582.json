    "text": "Orlando () is a city in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and is the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orange%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Central%20Florida\"&gt;Central Florida&lt;/a&gt;, it is the center of the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Orlando\"&gt;Orlando metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;, which had a population of 2,509,831, according to &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt; figures released in July 2017, making it the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Metropolitan%20Statistical%20Areas\"&gt;23rd-largest metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southern United States&lt;/a&gt;, and the third-largest metropolitan area in Florida behind &lt;a href=\"Miami\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tampa%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;. Orlando had a population of 307,573 in the 2020 census, making it the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20cities%20by%20population\"&gt;67th-largest city&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, the fourth-largest city in Florida, and the state's largest inland city.\nThe City of Orlando is nicknamed \"the City Beautiful\", and its symbol is the Linton E. Allen Memorial Fountain, commonly referred to as simply the \"Lake Eola fountain\" at &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Eola%20Park\"&gt;Lake Eola Park&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Orlando International Airport&lt;/a&gt; (MCO) is the 13th-busiest airport in the United States and the 29th-busiest in the world.\nOrlando is one of the most-visited cities in the world primarily due to tourism, major events, and convention traffic; in 2018, the city drew more than 75\u00a0million visitors. The two largest and most internationally renowned tourist attractions in the Orlando area are the &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20World\"&gt;Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt; Resort, opened by the &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20Company\"&gt;Walt Disney Company&lt;/a&gt; in 1971, and located about southwest of &lt;a href=\"downtown%20Orlando\"&gt;downtown Orlando&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bay%20Lake%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Bay Lake&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Orlando\"&gt;Universal Orlando&lt;/a&gt; Resort, opened in 1990 as a major expansion of &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Studios%20Florida\"&gt;Universal Studios Florida&lt;/a&gt; and the only theme park inside Orlando city limits.\nWith the exception of the theme parks, most major cultural sites like the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Orlando Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Phillips%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts\"&gt;Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts&lt;/a&gt; and world-renowned nightlife, bars and clubs are located in Downtown Orlando while most attractions are located along &lt;a href=\"International%20Drive\"&gt;International Drive&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"the%20Wheel%20at%20ICON%20Park%20Orlando\"&gt;the Wheel at ICON Park Orlando&lt;/a&gt;. The city is also one of the busiest American cities for conferences and conventions; the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20County%20Convention%20Center\"&gt;Orange County Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; is the second-largest convention facility in the United States.\nLike other major cities in the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Belt\"&gt;Sun Belt&lt;/a&gt;, Orlando grew rapidly from the 1970s into the first decade of the 21st century. Orlando is home to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Central%20Florida\"&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;/a&gt;, which is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20university%20campuses%20by%20enrollment\"&gt;largest university campus in the United States&lt;/a&gt; in terms of enrollment . In 2010, Orlando was listed as a \"Gamma +\" level &lt;a href=\"global%20city\"&gt;global city&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Globalization%20and%20World%20Cities%20Research%20Network\"&gt;Globalization and World Cities Research Network&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nFort Gatlin, as the Orlando area was once known, was established at what is now just south of the city limits by the &lt;a href=\"4th%20U.S.%20Artillery\"&gt;4th U.S. Artillery&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Ltc. Alexander C. W. Fanning on November 9, 1838, during the construction of a series of fortified encampments across Florida during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seminole%20War\"&gt;Second Seminole War&lt;/a&gt;. The fort and surrounding area were named for John S. Gatlin, an Army physician who was killed in &lt;a href=\"Dade%27s%20Massacre\"&gt;Dade's Massacre&lt;/a&gt; on December 28, 1835. The site of construction for Fort Gatlin, a defensible position with fresh water between three small lakes, was likely chosen because the location was on a main trail and is less than 250 yards from a nearby Council Oak tree, where &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; had traditionally met. &lt;a href=\"Ee-mat-la\"&gt;King Phillip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Cat%20%28Seminole%29\"&gt;Coacoochee&lt;/a&gt; frequented this area and the tree was alleged to be the place where the previous &lt;a href=\"Dade%27s%20Massacre\"&gt;1835 ambush&lt;/a&gt; that had killed over 100 soldiers had been planned. When the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;U.S. military&lt;/a&gt; abandoned the fort in 1839, the surrounding community was built up by settlers.\nPrior to being known by its current name, Orlando was once known as Jernigan. This name originates from the first European permanent settlers, Issac and &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Jernigan\"&gt;Aaron Jernigan&lt;/a&gt;, cattlemen who moved from the state of Georgia and acquired land northwest of Fort Gatlin along the west end of Lake Holden in July 1843 by the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Armed%20Occupation%20Act\"&gt;Armed Occupation Act&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron Jernigan became Orange County's first state representative in 1845, but his pleas for additional military protection went unanswered.\nFort Gatlin was briefly reoccupied by the military for a few weeks during October and November 1849, and subsequently a volunteer militia was left to defend the settlement. A historical marker indicates that by 1850, the Jernigan homestead (or Fort Gatlin in some sources) served as the nucleus of a village named Jernigan. According to an account written years later by his daughter, at that time, about 80 settlers were forced to shelter for about a year in \"a &lt;a href=\"stockade\"&gt;stockade&lt;/a&gt; that Aaron Jernigan built on the north side of Lake Conway\". One of the county's first records, a &lt;a href=\"grand%20jury\"&gt;grand jury&lt;/a&gt;'s report, mentions a stockade where it states homesteaders were \"driven from their homes and forced to huddle together in hasty defences [sic].\" Aaron Jernigan led a local volunteer militia during 1852.\nA post office opened at Jernigan in 1850. Jernigan appears on an 1855 map of Florida, and by 1856, the area had become the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of Orange County. In 1857, the post office was removed from Jernigan, and opened under the name of Orlando at a new location in present-day downtown Orlando. During the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the post office closed, but reopened in 1866. The move is believed to be sparked, in part, by Aaron Jernigan's fall from grace after he was relieved of his militia command by military officials in 1856. His behavior was so notorious that &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War\"&gt;United States Secretary of War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20Davis\"&gt;Jefferson Davis&lt;/a&gt; wrote, \"It is said they [Jernigan's militia] are more dreadful than the Indians.\" In 1859, Jernigan and his sons were accused of committing a murder at the town's post office. They were then transported to &lt;a href=\"Ocala\"&gt;Ocala&lt;/a&gt;, but escaped.\nAt least five stories relate how Orlando got its name. The most common stories are that the name Orlando originated from the tale of a man who died in 1835 during an attack by Native Americans in the area during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seminole%20War\"&gt;Second Seminole War&lt;/a&gt;. Several of the stories relay an oral history of the marker for a person named Orlando, and the \"&lt;a href=\"double%20entendre\"&gt;double entendre&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Here lies Orlando.\" One variant includes a man named Orlando who was passing by on his way to &lt;a href=\"Tampa%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt; with a herd of &lt;a href=\"oxen\"&gt;oxen&lt;/a&gt;, died, and was buried in a marked grave.\nAt a meeting in 1857, debate had grown concerning the name of the town. Pioneer William B. Hull recalled how James Speer (a local resident, and prominent figure in the stories behind the naming of Orlando) rose in the heat of the argument and said, \"This place is often spoken of as 'Orlando's Grave.' Let's drop the word 'grave' and let the county seat be Orlando.\"\nThrough a retelling of history, a marker of some sort was believed to have been found by one of the original pioneers, but others claim Speer simply used the Orlando Reeves legend to help push his plan for naming the settlement after the Shakespearean character.\nOrlando Reeves.\nHistorians agree that likely no soldier was named Orlando Reeves. &lt;a href=\"Folklore\"&gt;Folklore&lt;/a&gt; is that Reeves was acting as a &lt;a href=\"Border%20guard\"&gt;sentinel&lt;/a&gt; for a company of soldiers that had set up camp for the night on the banks of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Eola\"&gt;Sandy Beach Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Several different lakes are mentioned in the various versions, as no soldiers were in what is now downtown during 1835.\nThe legend grew throughout the early 1900s, particularly with local historian Olive Brumbaugh (or Kena Fries) retelling in various writings and on local radio station &lt;a href=\"WDBO%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WDBO&lt;/a&gt; in 1929. Another historian, Eldon H. Gore, promoted the Reeves legend in \"History of Orlando\" published in 1949. A memorial beside &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Eola\"&gt;Lake Eola&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 originally placed by students of Orlando's Cherokee Junior School in 1939 and updated in 1990 \u2013 designates the spot where the city's supposed namesake fell.\nConflicting legends exist. One legend has Reeves killed during an extended battle with the Seminoles after being field promoted after his platoon commander fell. An in-depth review of military records in the 1970s and 1980s, though, turned up no record of Orlando Reeves ever existing. Some versions attempt to account for Reeves having no military records by using the name of other people named Orlando that exist in some written records \u2013 Orlando Acosta; however, not much is known about Acosta or whether he even existed. Another version of the story has Orlando Reed, supposedly an Englishman and mail carrier between Fort Gatlin and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Mellon\"&gt;Fort Mellon&lt;/a&gt;, allegedly killed while camping with his friends near Fort Gatlin.\nA second variation also places the story in 1835 during the Second Seminole War. This name is taken from a &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolinian\"&gt;South Carolinian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cattle%20ranching\"&gt;cattle rancher&lt;/a&gt; named Orlando Savage Rees. Rees owned a &lt;a href=\"Volusia%20County\"&gt;Volusia County&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sugar%20mill\"&gt;sugar mill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"plantation\"&gt;plantation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as several large estates in Florida and &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;. Rees' sugar farms in the area were burned out in the Seminole attacks of 1835 (the year Orlando Reeves supposedly died). Subsequently, Rees led an expedition to recover stolen slaves and cattle. In 1837, Rees also attempted to stop a peace treaty with the Seminoles because it did not reimburse him for the loss of slaves and crops.\nRees could have left a pine-bough marker with his name next to the trail; later residents misread \"Rees\" as \"Reeves\" and also mistook it as a grave maker. In subsequent years, this story has merged with the Orlando Reeves story (which may have originally incorporated part of Dr. Gatlin's story).\nOn two separate occasions, relatives of Rees claimed their ancestor was the namesake of the city. F.K. Bull of South Carolina (Rees' great-grandson) told an Orlando reporter of a story in 1955; years later, Charles M. Bull, Jr., of Orlando (Rees' great-great-grandson) offered local historians similar information. Unlike Orlando Reeves, who cannot be traced to any historical record, the record is considerable that Orlando Rees did exist and was in Florida during that time. For example, in 1832, &lt;a href=\"John%20James%20Audubon\"&gt;John James Audubon&lt;/a&gt; met with Rees in his large estate at Spring Garden, about 45 minutes from Orlando.\nOrlando (\"As You Like It\").\nThe final variation has the city named after &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20%28As%20You%20Like%20It%29\"&gt;the protagonist&lt;/a&gt; in the Shakespeare play \"&lt;a href=\"As%20You%20Like%20It\"&gt;As You Like It&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1975, Judge Donald A. Cheney put forth a new version of the story in an \"&lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Sentinel\"&gt;Orlando Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;\" article. Cheney (a local historian and then chairman of the county historical commission) recounted a story told to him by his father, Judge &lt;a href=\"John%20Moses%20Cheney\"&gt;John Moses Cheney&lt;/a&gt; (a major figure in Orlando's history, who arrived in Orlando in 1885).\nThe elder Cheney recounted that another gentleman at that time, James Speer, proposed the name Orlando after the character in \"As You Like It\". According to Cheney, Speer, \"was a gentleman of culture and an admirer of William Shakespeare... Quoting a letter that Speer wrote, \"Orlando was a veritable &lt;a href=\"Arden%2C%20Warwickshire\"&gt;Forest of Arden&lt;/a&gt;, the locale of \"As You Like It.\"\" Speer's descendants have also confirmed this version of the naming and the legend has continued to grow.\nThis account also has some validity in that, as mentioned above, Speer was instrumental in changing the name of the settlement from Jernigan to Orlando, though he may have used the Orlando Reeves legend in lieu of his true intent to use the Shakespearean character. According to yet another version of the story, Orlando may have been the name of one of his employees. One of &lt;a href=\"downtown%20Orlando\"&gt;downtown Orlando&lt;/a&gt;'s major streets is named Rosalind Avenue; &lt;a href=\"Rosalind%20%28As%20You%20Like%20It%29\"&gt;Rosalind&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"heroine\"&gt;heroine&lt;/a&gt; of \"As You Like It\", but this could also be a simple coincidence\".\nHistory.\nSettlement.\nIn 1823, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Moultrie%20Creek\"&gt;Treaty of Moultrie Creek&lt;/a&gt; created a &lt;a href=\"Seminole\"&gt;Seminole&lt;/a&gt; reservation encompassing much of central Florida, including the area that would become Orlando. The &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Removal%20Act\"&gt;Indian Removal Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1830 authorized relocation of the Seminole from Florida to Oklahoma, leading to the Second Seminole War. In 1842, white settlement in the area was encouraged by the Armed Occupation Act. The first settler, Mr. &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Jernigan\"&gt;Aaron Jernigan&lt;/a&gt; of Camden County, Georgia, arrived the following year and settled near Lake Holden.\n&lt;a href=\"Mosquito%20County\"&gt;Mosquito County&lt;/a&gt; was renamed Orange County in 1845, with the county seat shortly thereafter relocated to Mellonville, a few miles west of &lt;a href=\"Sanford%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Sanford&lt;/a&gt;. By 1856, settlement had begun in earnest in the interior of the county and a more centrally-located Courthouse was sought. The new town of Orlando, laid out in 1857, consisted of four streets surrounding a courthouse square. The fledgling village suffered greatly during the &lt;a href=\"Union%20blockade\"&gt;Union blockade&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Reconstruction%20Era\"&gt;Reconstruction Era&lt;/a&gt; brought on a population explosion, resulting in the incorporation of the Town of Orlando on July 31, 1875, with 85 residents (22 voters). For a short time in 1879, the town revoked its charter, and was subsequently reincorporated. Orlando was established as a city in 1885.\nThe period from 1875 to 1895 is remembered as Orlando's Golden Era, when it became the hub of Florida's &lt;a href=\"citrus\"&gt;citrus&lt;/a&gt; industry. The period ended with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Freeze\"&gt;Great Freeze of 1894\u201395&lt;/a&gt;, which forced many owners to give up their independent citrus &lt;a href=\"Grove%20%28nature%29\"&gt;grove&lt;/a&gt;s, thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few \"citrus barons\", who shifted operations south, primarily around &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Wales%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Lake Wales&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Polk%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Polk County&lt;/a&gt;. The freeze caused many in Florida, including many Orlandoans, to move elsewhere, mostly to &lt;a href=\"Northern%20United%20States\"&gt;the North&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable homesteaders in the area included the Curry family. Through their property in east Orlando flowed the &lt;a href=\"Econlockhatchee%20River\"&gt;Econlockhatchee River&lt;/a&gt;, which travelers crossed by &lt;a href=\"ford%20%28crossing%29\"&gt;fording&lt;/a&gt;. This was commemorated by the street's name, Curry Ford Road. Also, just south of the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Orlando International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in the Boggy Creek area are of property homesteaded in the late 19th century by the Ward family. This property is still owned by the Ward family, and can be seen from southbound flights out of Orlando International Airport immediately on the south side of SR 417.\nPost\u2013Industrial Revolution.\nOrlando became a popular resort during the years between the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Spanish\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1920s, Orlando experienced extensive housing development during the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Land%20Boom\"&gt;Florida Land Boom&lt;/a&gt;, causing land prices to soar. During this period, dozens of neighborhoods in the vicinity of downtown were constructed. The boom ended when several &lt;a href=\"hurricanes\"&gt;hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; hit Florida in the late 1920s, along with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, a number of Army personnel were stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Orlando Army Air Base&lt;/a&gt; and nearby &lt;a href=\"McCoy%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Pinecastle Army Air Field&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these servicemen stayed in Orlando to settle and raise families. In 1956, the aerospace and defense company &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Marietta\"&gt;Martin Marietta&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin\"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt;) established a plant in the city. Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF were transferred to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; in 1947 when it became a separate service and were redesignated as air force bases (AFB). In 1958, Pinecastle AFB was renamed McCoy Air Force Base after Colonel Michael N. W. McCoy, a former commander of the 320th Bombardment Wing at the installation, killed in the crash of a &lt;a href=\"B-47\"&gt;B-47&lt;/a&gt; Stratojet bomber north of Orlando. In the 1960s, the base subsequently became home to the 306th Bombardment Wing of the &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20Air%20Command\"&gt;Strategic Air Command&lt;/a&gt;, operating &lt;a href=\"B-52%20Stratofortress\"&gt;B-52 Stratofortress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"KC-135\"&gt;KC-135&lt;/a&gt; Stratotanker aircraft, in addition to detachment operations by &lt;a href=\"EC-121\"&gt;EC-121&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20U-2\"&gt;U-2&lt;/a&gt; aircraft.\nIn 1968, Orlando AFB was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; and became Naval Training Center Orlando. In addition to boot camp facilities, the NTC Orlando was home of one of two Navy Nuclear Power Schools, and home of the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Air%20Warfare%20Center%20Training%20Systems%20Division\"&gt;Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division&lt;/a&gt;. When McCoy AFB closed in 1976, its runways and territory to its south and east were imparted to the city to become &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Orlando International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, while a small portion to the northwest was transferred to the Navy as McCoy NTC Annex. That closed in 1995, and became a housing, though the former McCoy AFB still hosts a Navy Exchange, as well as national guard and reserve units for several branches of service. NTC Orlando was completely closed by the end of 1999 by the &lt;a href=\"Base%20Realignment%20and%20Closure%20Commission\"&gt;Base Realignment and Closure Commission&lt;/a&gt;, and converted into the Baldwin Park neighborhood. The Naval Air Warfare Center had moved to Central Florida Research Park near UCF in 1989.\nTourism in history.\nPerhaps the most critical event for Orlando's economy occurred in 1965 when &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney\"&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt; announced plans to build &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20World\"&gt;Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt;. Although Disney had considered the regions of Miami and &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt; for his park, one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to &lt;a href=\"hurricane\"&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt;s \u2013 Orlando's inland location, although not free from hurricane damage, exposed it to less threat than coastal regions. The vacation resort opened in October 1971, ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the Orlando metropolitan area, which now encompasses Orange, &lt;a href=\"Seminole%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Seminole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osceola%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Osceola&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Lake&lt;/a&gt; Counties. As a result, tourism became the centerpiece of the area's economy. Orlando now has more &lt;a href=\"theme%20park\"&gt;theme park&lt;/a&gt;s and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world.\nAnother major factor in Orlando's growth occurred in 1962, when the new Orlando Jetport, the precursor of the present-day Orlando International Airport, was built from a portion of the McCoy Air Force Base. By 1970, four major airlines (&lt;a href=\"Delta%20Air%20Lines\"&gt;Delta Air Lines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"National%20Airlines%20%28NA%29\"&gt;National Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Airlines\"&gt;Eastern Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Airways\"&gt;Southern Airways&lt;/a&gt;) were providing scheduled flights. McCoy Air Force Base officially closed in 1975, and most of it is now part of the airport. The airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code (MCO).\n21st century.\nToday, the historic core of \"Old Orlando\" resides in &lt;a href=\"downtown%20Orlando\"&gt;downtown Orlando&lt;/a&gt; along Church Street, between Orange Avenue and Garland Avenue.\nThe urban development and the central business district of downtown have rapidly shaped the downtown skyline during recent history. The present-day &lt;a href=\"historic%20district\"&gt;historic district&lt;/a&gt; is primarily associated with the neighborhoods around &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Eola\"&gt;Lake Eola&lt;/a&gt; but stretches west across the city to Lake Lorna Dune and north into the College Park Neighborhood where you can find century-old oaks line brick streets. These neighborhoods include the \"Downtown Business District,\" \"North Quarter,\" \"Parramore,\" \"Callahan,\" \"South Eola Heights, \"Lake Eola Heights,\"Thornton Park\" and \"College Park\", and contain some of the oldest homes in Orlando.\n2016 mass shooting.\nOn June 12, 2016, more than 100 people were shot at &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20%28nightclub%29\"&gt;Pulse&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"gay%20bar\"&gt;gay nightclub&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando. Fifty (including the gunman) were killed and 60 were wounded. The gunman, whom the police &lt;a href=\"SWAT%20team\"&gt;SWAT team&lt;/a&gt; shot to death, was identified as 29-year-old &lt;a href=\"Omar%20Mateen\"&gt;Omar Mir Seddique Mateen&lt;/a&gt;, an American security guard. The act of terrorism was both the deadliest &lt;a href=\"mass%20shooting\"&gt;mass shooting&lt;/a&gt; in modern United States history at the time and one of the deadliest mass shootings perpetrated by a single person in recorded world history. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during his unsuccessful negotiations with police. After the shooting, the city held numerous vigils. In November 2016, Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer announced the city's intention to acquire the Pulse Nightclub to build a permanent memorial for the 49 victims of the shooting. The city offered to buy it for $2.25\u00a0million, but the club's owner declined to sell.\nGeography and cityscape.\nThe geography of Orlando is mostly &lt;a href=\"wetlands\"&gt;wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of many lakes and swamps. The terrain is generally flat, making the land fairly low and wet. The area is dotted with hundreds of lakes, the largest of which is &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Apopka\"&gt;Lake Apopka&lt;/a&gt;. Central Florida's &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; is mostly &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; and very porous; the Orlando area is susceptible to &lt;a href=\"sinkholes\"&gt;sinkholes&lt;/a&gt;. Probably the most famous incident involving a sinkhole happened in 1981 in Winter Park, a city immediately north of downtown Orlando, dubbed &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Park%2C%20Florida%23The%20Winter%20Park%20sinkhole\"&gt;\"The Winter Park Sinkhole&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThere are 115 neighborhoods within the city limits and many &lt;a href=\"Unincorporated%20area\"&gt;unincorporated&lt;/a&gt; communities. Orlando's city limits resemble a checkerboard, with pockets of unincorporated Orange County surrounded by city limits. Such an arrangement results in some areas being served by both Orange County and the City of Orlando. This also explains Orlando's relatively low city population when compared to its metropolitan population. The city and county are working together in an effort to \"round-out\" the city limits with Orlando annexing portions of land already bordering the city limits.\nSkyscrapers.\nMetro Orlando has a total of 19 completed skyscrapers. The majority are located in downtown Orlando and the rest are located in the tourist district southwest of downtown. Skyscrapers built in downtown Orlando have not exceeded , since 1988, when the &lt;a href=\"SunTrust%20Center\"&gt;SunTrust Center&lt;/a&gt; was completed. The main reason for this is the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Executive%20Airport\"&gt;Orlando Executive Airport&lt;/a&gt;, just under from the city center, which does not allow buildings to exceed a certain height without approval from the FAA.\nClimate.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt;, Orlando has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Cfa\") like much of the deep Southern United States. The two basic seasons in Orlando are a hot and rainy season, lasting from May until late October (roughly coinciding with the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20hurricane%20season\"&gt;Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;), and a warm and dry season from November through April. The area's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation, its position relatively close to the &lt;a href=\"Tropic%20of%20Cancer\"&gt;Tropic of Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and its location in the center of a &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20peninsulas\"&gt;peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Many characteristics of its climate are a result of its proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Stream\"&gt;Gulf Stream&lt;/a&gt;, which flows around the peninsula of Florida.\nDuring the height of Orlando's humid summer season, high temperatures are typically in the low 90s \u00b0F (32\u201334\u00a0\u00b0C), while low temperatures rarely fall below the low 70s \u00b0F (22\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C). The average window for temperatures is April 9 to October 14. The area's humidity acts as a buffer, usually preventing actual temperatures from exceeding , but also pushing the &lt;a href=\"heat%20index\"&gt;heat index&lt;/a&gt; to over . The city's highest recorded temperature is , set on September 8, 1921. During these months, strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily. These storms are caused by air masses from the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and the Atlantic Ocean colliding over Central Florida. They are highlighted by spectacular &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; and can also bring heavy rain (sometimes several inches per hour) and powerful winds as well as rare damaging &lt;a href=\"hail\"&gt;hail&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the winter, humidity is much lower and temperatures are more moderate, and can fluctuate more readily. The monthly daily average temperature in January is . Temperatures dip below the freezing mark on an average of only 1.6 nights per year and the lowest recorded temperature is , set on &lt;a href=\"Great%20Freeze\"&gt;December 28, 1894&lt;/a&gt;. Because the winter season is dry and freezing temperatures usually occur only after cold fronts (and their accompanying precipitation) have passed, snow is exceptionally rare. The only accumulation ever to occur in the city proper since record keeping began was in 1948, although some accumulation occurred in surrounding areas in a snow event in January 1977 that reached Miami. Flurries have also been observed &lt;a href=\"December%201989%20United%20States%20cold%20wave\"&gt;in 1989&lt;/a&gt;, 2006, and 2010.\nThe average annual rainfall in Orlando is , a majority of which occurs in the period from June to September. October through May are Orlando's dry season. During this period (especially in its later months), often a &lt;a href=\"wildfire\"&gt;wildfire&lt;/a&gt; hazard exists. During some years, fires have been severe. In 1998, a strong &lt;a href=\"El%20Ni%C3%B1o-Southern%20Oscillation\"&gt;El Ni\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt; caused an unusually wet January and February, followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer, causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air-quality alerts in Orlando and severely affected normal daily life, including the postponement of that year's &lt;a href=\"Coke%20Zero%20400\"&gt;Pepsi 400&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"NASCAR\"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; race in nearby &lt;a href=\"Daytona%20Beach%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Daytona Beach&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrlando is a major population center and has a considerable &lt;a href=\"hurricane\"&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt; risk, although it is not as high as in &lt;a href=\"South%20Florida\"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt;'s urban corridor or other coastal regions. Since the city is located inland from the Atlantic and inland from the Gulf of Mexico, hurricanes usually weaken before arriving. Storm surges are not a concern since the region is &lt;a href=\"above%20mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;above mean sea level&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its location, the city does see strong hurricanes. During the notorious &lt;a href=\"2004%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season\"&gt;2004 hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;, Orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage, with &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Charley\"&gt;Hurricane Charley&lt;/a&gt; the worst of these. The city also experienced widespread damage during &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Donna\"&gt;Hurricane Donna&lt;/a&gt; in 1960.\n&lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;es are not usually connected with the strong thunderstorms of the humid summer. They are more common during the infrequent cold days of winter, as well as in passing hurricanes. The two worst major outbreaks in the area's history, a &lt;a href=\"1998%20Kissimmee%20tornado%20outbreak\"&gt;1998 outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that killed 42 people and a &lt;a href=\"2007%20Groundhog%20Day%20tornado%20outbreak\"&gt;2007 outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that killed 21, both happened in February.\nDemographics.\nAs of 2010, there were 121,254 households, out of which 15.4% were vacant. As of 2000, 24.5% of households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 32.4% were married couples living together, 15.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 47.6% were non-families. 35.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.25 and the average family size was 2.97.\nIn 2014, the city's population was spread out, with 12.0% under the age of 18, 5.7% from 18 to 24, 27.3% from 25 to 44, 18.6% from 45 to 64, and 36.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.3 males.\nOrlando not only has the largest population of &lt;a href=\"Stateside%20Puerto%20Ricans\"&gt;Puerto Ricans&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, but is also home to the fastest growing Puerto Rican community in the country. Between 1980 and 2010, the Hispanic population increased from 4.1 to 25.4%. Orlando has an active Jewish community.\nOrlando has a large LGBT population and is recognized as one of the most accepting and tolerant cities in the Southeast. , around 4.1% of Orlando's population identify as LGBT, making Orlando the city with the 20th-highest percentage of LGBT residents in the country. The city is host to &lt;a href=\"Gay%20Days%20at%20Walt%20Disney%20World\"&gt;Gay Days&lt;/a&gt; every June (including at nearby &lt;a href=\"Gay%20Days%20at%20Walt%20Disney%20World\"&gt;Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt;), holds a huge Pride festival every October, and is home to Florida's first openly gay City Commissioner, Patty Sheehan.\nLanguages.\nAs of 2000, 75% of all residents speak English as their first language, while 16.60% speak Spanish, 1.9% speak &lt;a href=\"Haitian%20Creole\"&gt;Haitian Creole&lt;/a&gt;, 1.3% speak French, 0.99% speak Portuguese, and 0.5% of the population speak Arabic as their mother language. In total, 24% of the population 5 years and older speak a language other than English at home.\nAccording to the American Community Survey of 2006\u20132008, 69% of Orlando's residents over the age of five spoke only English at home. Spanish-speakers represented 19.2% of Orlando's population. Speakers of other &lt;a href=\"Indo-European%20languages\"&gt;Indo-European languages&lt;/a&gt; made up 9% of the city's population. Those who spoke an &lt;a href=\"Languages%20of%20Asia\"&gt;Asian language&lt;/a&gt; made up 1% of the population, and speakers of other languages made up the remaining 0.6% of the populace.\nMetropolitan statistical area.\nOrlando is the hub city of the &lt;a href=\"Orlando-Kissimmee%2C%20Florida%2C%20Metropolitan%20Statistical%20Area\"&gt;Orlando-Kissimmee, Florida, Metropolitan Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt;, colloquially known as \"Greater Orlando\" or \"Metro Orlando\". The area encompasses four counties (&lt;a href=\"Orange%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osceola%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Osceola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seminole%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Seminole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Lake&lt;/a&gt;), and is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20metropolitan%20statistical%20areas%20by%20population\"&gt;26th-largest metro area&lt;/a&gt; in the United States with a 2010 Census-estimated population of 2,134,411.\nIn 2000, the population of Orlando's urban area was 1,157,431, making it the third-largest in Florida and the 35th-largest in the United States. As of 2009, the estimated urban area population of Orlando is 1,377,342.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Combined%20Statistical%20Area\"&gt;Combined Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt;s were instituted in 2000, Orlando was initially joined together with &lt;a href=\"The%20Villages%2C%20Florida\"&gt;The Villages, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, Micropolitan Statistical Area, to form the Orlando-The Villages, Florida, &lt;a href=\"Combined%20Statistical%20Area\"&gt;Combined Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt;. In 2006, the metropolitan areas of &lt;a href=\"Deltona%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Deltona&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Volusia%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Volusia County&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Palm%20Coast%2C%20Florida%20Metropolitan%20Statistical%20Area\"&gt;Palm Coast&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Flagler%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Flagler County&lt;/a&gt;) were added to create the Orlando-Deltona-Daytona Beach, Florida, Combined Statistical Area. This new larger CSA has a total population (as of 2007) of 2,693,552, and includes three of the 25 fastest-growing counties in the nation\u2014Flagler ranks 1st; Osceola, 17th; and Lake, 23rd.\nEconomy.\nIndustry.\nOrlando is a major industrial and &lt;a href=\"hi-tech\"&gt;hi-tech&lt;/a&gt; center. The metro area has a $13.4\u00a0billion technology industry employing 53,000 people; and is a nationally recognized cluster of innovation in digital media, agricultural technology, aviation, aerospace, and software design. More than 150 international companies, representing approximately 20 countries, have facilities in Metro Orlando.\nOrlando has the 7th-largest research park in the country, &lt;a href=\"Central%20Florida%20Research%20Park\"&gt;Central Florida Research Park&lt;/a&gt;, with over .

The Naval Training Center until a few years ago was one of the two places where nuclear engineers were trained for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;. Now the land has been converted into the Baldwin Park development. Numerous office complexes for large corporations have popped up along the &lt;a href=\"Interstate%204\"&gt;Interstate 4&lt;/a&gt; corridor north of Orlando, especially in &lt;a href=\"Maitland%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Maitland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Mary%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Lake Mary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heathrow%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Heathrow&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrlando is close enough to &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Space%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Patrick Space Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Canaveral%20Space%20Force%20Station\"&gt;Cape Canaveral Space Force Station&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kennedy%20Space%20Center\"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; for residents to commute to work from the city's suburbs.

The U.S. &lt;a href=\"Institute%20for%20Simulation%20and%20Training\"&gt;modeling, simulation, and training&lt;/a&gt; (MS&amp;T) industry is centered on the Orlando region as well, with a particularly strong presence in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Florida%20Research%20Park\"&gt;Central Florida Research Park&lt;/a&gt; adjacent to &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Central%20Florida\"&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;/a&gt; (UCF). Nearby Maitland is the home of Tiburon, a division of the video game company &lt;a href=\"Electronic%20Arts\"&gt;Electronic Arts&lt;/a&gt;. Tiburon Entertainment was acquired by EA in 1998 after years of partnership, particularly in the &lt;a href=\"Madden%20NFL\"&gt;Madden NFL&lt;/a&gt; series and &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Football%20series\"&gt;NCAA Football series&lt;/a&gt; of video games. Nearby &lt;a href=\"Full%20Sail%20University\"&gt;Full Sail University&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Park%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Winter Park&lt;/a&gt;, draws new-media students in the areas of video game design, film, show production, and computer animation, among others, its graduates spawning several start-ups in these fields in the Orlando area. The headquarters of Ripley Entertainment Inc. are also located in Orlando.\nHealthcare.\nOrlando has two non-profit hospital systems: &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Health\"&gt;Orlando Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adventist%20Health%20System\"&gt;AdventHealth&lt;/a&gt;. Orlando Health's &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Regional%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Orlando Regional Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; is home to Central Florida's only Level I &lt;a href=\"trauma%20center\"&gt;trauma center&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Winnie%20Palmer%20Hospital%20for%20Women%20and%20Babies\"&gt;Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AdventHealth%20Orlando\"&gt;AdventHealth Orlando&lt;/a&gt; have the area's only Level III &lt;a href=\"neonatal%20intensive%20care%20unit\"&gt;neonatal intensive care unit&lt;/a&gt;s. Orlando's medical leadership was further advanced with the completion of &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Central%20Florida\"&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;/a&gt;'s College of Medicine, a new &lt;a href=\"Veterans%20Health%20Administration\"&gt;VA Hospital&lt;/a&gt; and the new &lt;a href=\"Nemours%20Children%27s%20Hospital\"&gt;Nemours Children's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in a new medical district in the Lake Nona area of the city.\nHousing and employment.\nHistorically, the unemployment rate in Greater Orlando was low, which resulted in growth that led to &lt;a href=\"urban%20sprawl\"&gt;urban sprawl&lt;/a&gt; in the surrounding area and, in combination with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20housing%20bubble\"&gt;United States housing bubble&lt;/a&gt;, to a large increase in home prices. Metro Orlando's unemployment rate in June 2010 was 11.1 percent, was 11.4 percent in April 2010, and was about 10 percent in about the same time of year in 2009. As of August 2013, the area's jobless rate was 6.6 percent. Housing prices in Greater Orlando went up 37.08% in one year, from a median of $182,300 in November 2004 to $249,900 in November 2005, and eventually peaked at $264,436 in July 2007. From there, with the economic meltdown, prices plummeted, with the median falling below $200,000 in September 2008, at one point falling at an annual rate of 39.27%. The median dipped below $100,000 in 2010 before stabilizing around $110,000 in 2011. As of April 2012, the median home price is $116,000.\nTourism.\n One of the main driving forces in Orlando's economy is its tourism industry and the city is one of the leading tourism destinations in the world. Nicknamed the 'Theme Park Capital of the World', the Orlando area is home to &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20World\"&gt;Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Orlando\"&gt;Universal Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"SeaWorld%20Orlando\"&gt;SeaWorld Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Legoland%20Florida\"&gt;Legoland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fun%20Spot%20America\"&gt;Fun Spot America&lt;/a&gt; Theme Parks. A record 75\u00a0million visitors came to the Orlando region in 2018, making it the top tourist destination in the United States.\nThe Orlando area features 7 of the 10 most visited &lt;a href=\"theme%20park\"&gt;theme park&lt;/a&gt;s in North America (5 of the top 10 in the world), as well as the 4 most visited &lt;a href=\"water%20park\"&gt;water park&lt;/a&gt;s in the U.S. The Walt Disney World resort is the area's largest attraction with its many facets such as the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Kingdom\"&gt;Magic Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Epcot\"&gt;Epcot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disney%27s%20Hollywood%20Studios\"&gt;Disney's Hollywood Studios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disney%27s%20Animal%20Kingdom\"&gt;Disney's Animal Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disney%27s%20Typhoon%20Lagoon\"&gt;Typhoon Lagoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disney%27s%20Blizzard%20Beach\"&gt;Blizzard Beach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Disney%20Springs\"&gt;Disney Springs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Orlando\"&gt;Universal Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, like Walt Disney World, is a multi-faceted resort comprising &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Studios%20Florida\"&gt;Universal Studios Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Islands%20of%20Adventure\"&gt;Islands of Adventure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Bay\"&gt;Volcano Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Universal%20CityWalk%20Orlando\"&gt;Universal CityWalk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"SeaWorld%20Orlando\"&gt;SeaWorld Orlando&lt;/a&gt; is a large park that features numerous zoological displays and marine animals alongside an amusement park with roller coasters like &lt;a href=\"Mako%20%28roller%20coaster%29\"&gt;Mako&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manta%20%28SeaWorld%20Orlando%29\"&gt;Manta&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kraken%20%28roller%20coaster%29\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt;. The property also comprises more than one park, alongside &lt;a href=\"Aquatica%20Orlando\"&gt;Aquatica water park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Discovery%20Cove\"&gt;Discovery Cove&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fun%20Spot%20America%20Theme%20Parks\"&gt;Fun Spot Orlando&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fun%20Spot%20America%20Theme%20Parks\"&gt;Kissimmee&lt;/a&gt; are more typical amusement parks with big thrills in a small space with roller coasters like &lt;a href=\"White%20Lightning%20%28roller%20coaster%29\"&gt;White Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20Flyer\"&gt;Freedom Flyer&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando and &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Blower\"&gt;Mine Blower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fun%20Spot%20America%20Theme%20Parks\"&gt;Rockstar Coaster&lt;/a&gt; in Kissimmee. Orlando is also home to I-Drive 360 on &lt;a href=\"International%20Drive\"&gt;International Drive&lt;/a&gt; home to The Wheel at ICON Park Orlando, &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Tussauds\"&gt;Madame Tussauds&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Life%20Centres\"&gt;Sealife Aquarium&lt;/a&gt;. Orlando attractions also appeal to many locals who want to enjoy themselves close to home.\nThe convention industry is also critical to the region's economy. The &lt;a href=\"Orange%20County%20Convention%20Center\"&gt;Orange County Convention Center&lt;/a&gt;, expanded in 2004 to over two million square feet (200,000 m2) of exhibition space, is now the second-largest convention complex in terms of space in the United States, trailing only &lt;a href=\"McCormick%20Place\"&gt;McCormick Place&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago. The city vies with Chicago and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; for hosting the most convention attendees in the United States.\nGolf.\nNumerous golf courses can be found in the city, with the most famous being &lt;a href=\"Bay%20Hill%20Club%20and%20Lodge\"&gt;Bay Hill Club and Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, home to the &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Palmer%20Invitational\"&gt;Arnold Palmer Invitational&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nEntertainment and performing arts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"hip%20hop%20music\"&gt;hip hop music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt;, rock music, &lt;a href=\"reggaeton\"&gt;reggaeton&lt;/a&gt; and Latino music scenes are all active within the city. Orlando is known as \"Hollywood East\" because of numerous movie studios in the area. Major motion picture production was active in the city during the mid-to-late 1990s, but has slowed in the past decade. Probably the most famous film-making moment in the city's history occurred with the implosion of Orlando's previous City Hall for the movie \"&lt;a href=\"Lethal%20Weapon%203\"&gt;Lethal Weapon 3&lt;/a&gt;\". Orlando is now a large production center for television shows, direct-to-video productions, and commercial production. In early 2011, filmmaker Marlon Campbell constructed A-Match Pictures and Angel Media Studios; a multimillion-dollar film and recording facility that has been added to the list of major studios in the city.\nUntil recently, Walt Disney Feature Animation operated a studio in &lt;a href=\"Disney%27s%20Hollywood%20Studios\"&gt;Disney's Hollywood Studios&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20World\"&gt;Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt;. Feature Animation-Florida was primarily responsible for the films \"&lt;a href=\"Mulan%20%281998%20film%29\"&gt;Mulan&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Lilo%20%26amp%3B%20Stitch\"&gt;Lilo &amp; Stitch&lt;/a&gt;\", and the early stages of \"&lt;a href=\"Brother%20Bear\"&gt;Brother Bear&lt;/a&gt;\" and contributed on various other projects. &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Studios%20Florida\"&gt;Universal Studios Florida&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Soundstage%2021\"&gt;Soundstage 21&lt;/a&gt; is home to &lt;a href=\"Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling\"&gt;TNA Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;'s flagship show &lt;a href=\"TNA%20Impact%21\"&gt;TNA Impact!&lt;/a&gt;. Nickelodeon Studios, which through the 1990s produced hundreds of hours of GAK-filled game shows targeted at children, no longer operates out of Universal Studios Florida. The &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Florida Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; which takes place in venues throughout the area is one of the most respected regional film festivals in the country and attracts budding filmmakers from around the world. Orlando is very popular among independent filmmakers. Orlando's &lt;a href=\"indie%20film\"&gt;indie film&lt;/a&gt; scene has been active since Haxan Film's \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Blair%20Witch%20Project\"&gt;The Blair Witch Project&lt;/a&gt;\" (1999) and a few years later with &lt;a href=\"Charlize%20Theron\"&gt;Charlize Theron&lt;/a&gt; winning her &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award\"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"Monster%20%282003%20film%29\"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;\" (2003). A Florida state film incentive has also helped increase the number of films being produced in Orlando and the rest of the state.\nThe Orlando Metropolitan Area is home to a substantial theater population. Several professional and semi-professional houses and many community theaters include the Central Florida Ballet, Orlando Ballet, &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Shakespeare%20Theater\"&gt;Orlando Shakespeare Theater&lt;/a&gt;, Orlando Repertory Theatre, &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Cow%20Theatre\"&gt;Mad Cow Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, and IceHouse Theatre in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Dora%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Mount Dora&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Theatre%20Project\"&gt;Orlando Theatre Project&lt;/a&gt;, closed in 2009. Additionally, both &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Central%20Florida\"&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rollins%20College\"&gt;Rollins College&lt;/a&gt; (Winter Park) are home to theater departments that attract an influx of young artists to the area.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Carr%20Performing%20Arts%20Centre\"&gt;Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre&lt;/a&gt; had hosted national Broadway tours on a regular basis. This venue was built in 1926 and underwent a major renovation in 1974. The Bob Carr has since closed due to the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic and has yet to host a show since February 2020. While waiting on the completion of Phase II construction of the &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Phillips%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts\"&gt;Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts&lt;/a&gt;, the newly designated Bob Carr Theater will continue to host non-Broadway events.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20International%20Fringe%20Theater%20Festival\"&gt;Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival&lt;/a&gt;, which draws touring companies from around the world, is hosted in various venues over Orlando's Loch Haven Park every spring. At the festival, there are also readings and fully staged productions of new and unknown plays by local artists. Also in the spring, there is The Harriett Lake Festival of New Plays, hosted by Orlando Shakespeare Theater. Founded in 2002, the Orlando Cabaret Festival showcases local, national, and internationally renowned cabaret artist to Mad Cow Theatre in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Orlando\"&gt;Downtown Orlando&lt;/a&gt; each spring.\nClassical Music and Music Theater are also represented. Orlando has two professional orchestras - the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Symphony%20Orchestra\"&gt;Orlando Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, which was founded in 1991 when the Central Florida Friends of Music reorganized, and the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra\"&gt;Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1993, the second of which also serves as the orchestra for productions of Opera Orlando, which developed when the Florida Opera Theater, founded in 2009, reorganized in 2016.\nLocal culture.\nA substantial amount of the teenage and young adult populations identify as being &lt;a href=\"Goth%20subculture\"&gt;goth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emo\"&gt;emo&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Punk%20subculture\"&gt;punk&lt;/a&gt;. Orlando experienced its own &lt;a href=\"Second%20Summer%20of%20Love\"&gt;Second Summer of Love&lt;/a&gt; between 1991 and 1992 that popularized the subculture surrounding &lt;a href=\"electronic%20dance%20music\"&gt;electronic dance music&lt;/a&gt; in Florida. The culture progressed as time went on, starting in 1995 from when alternative-rock band &lt;a href=\"Matchbox%20Twenty\"&gt;Matchbox Twenty&lt;/a&gt;, and pop bands &lt;a href=\"NSync\"&gt;NSync&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Backstreet%20Boys\"&gt;Backstreet Boys&lt;/a&gt; originated. Over the years, the intensity of the music increased. In the late 1990s, &lt;a href=\"Skrape\"&gt;Skrape&lt;/a&gt;, a metal band, was established, shortly followed by the &lt;a href=\"screamo\"&gt;screamo&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"From%20First%20to%20Last\"&gt;From First to Last&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"alternative%20metal\"&gt;alternative metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Fireflight\"&gt;Fireflight&lt;/a&gt;. In the early 2000s, the heavy metal bands &lt;a href=\"Trivium%20%28band%29\"&gt;Trivium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mindscar\"&gt;Mindscar&lt;/a&gt; formed. In the later 2000s, more screamo bands, such as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Dance%20Floor%20%28duo%29\"&gt;Blood on the Dance Floor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20with%20Sirens\"&gt;Sleeping with Sirens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20%28band%29\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; were established. Major companies, such as &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Topic\"&gt;Hot Topic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vans\"&gt;Vans&lt;/a&gt; have noticed and taken advantage of this. Hot Topic, an emo retailer, established 5 stores in Orlando. The &lt;a href=\"Vans%20Warped%20Tour\"&gt;Vans Warped Tour&lt;/a&gt;, a concert containing metalcore/screamo/punk bands, takes place in Orlando annually.\nIn popular culture.\nThe films \"&lt;a href=\"Miami%20Connection\"&gt;Miami Connection&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Saves%20Christmas\"&gt;Ernest Saves Christmas&lt;/a&gt;\", ', \"&lt;a href=\"Never%20Back%20Down\"&gt;Never Back Down&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Florida%20Project\"&gt;The Florida Project&lt;/a&gt;\" take place in and were filmed entirely in Orlando. The novel \"&lt;a href=\"Paper%20Towns\"&gt;Paper Towns&lt;/a&gt;\" takes place in the city, but the &lt;a href=\"Paper%20Towns%20%28film%29\"&gt;film adaptation&lt;/a&gt; was shot in &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Establishing shots were filmed around Orlando; notably in downtown and along Orange Blossom Trail. \"&lt;a href=\"Geostorm\"&gt;Geostorm&lt;/a&gt;\" has a scene where Orlando is destroyed by a lightning storm. However, those scenes were filmed in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Parenthood%20%28film%29\"&gt;Parenthood&lt;/a&gt;\" was filmed entirely in Orlando, but takes place in St. Louis. \"&lt;a href=\"D.A.R.Y.L.\"&gt;D.A.R.Y.L.&lt;/a&gt;\" was partially filmed in Orlando; notably the climactic chase scene takes place in downtown Orlando along State Road 408 (East/West Expressway). Scenes were also filmed for ' at the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Orlando International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in early October 2010. Orlando is also the city very prominently featured in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; sitcom \"&lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Off%20the%20Boat\"&gt;Fresh Off the Boat&lt;/a&gt;\". Though set in &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, filming for \"&lt;a href=\"Passenger%2057\"&gt;Passenger 57&lt;/a&gt;\" took place in &lt;a href=\"Wesley%20Snipes\"&gt;Wesley Snipes&lt;/a&gt;' hometown of Orlando, Florida, with &lt;a href=\"Orlando-Sanford%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Orlando-Sanford International Airport&lt;/a&gt; standing in for \"Lake Lucille\" airport. The airport's former combination main hangar and control tower from its time as &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Air%20Station%20Sanford\"&gt;Naval Air Station Sanford&lt;/a&gt; was used for many key scenes just prior to its demolition after filming. Various scenes from \"&lt;a href=\"Monster%20%282003%20film%29\"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;\", set in &lt;a href=\"Daytona%20Beach\"&gt;Daytona Beach&lt;/a&gt;, were also filmed in the Orlando, &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Park%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Winter Park, Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kissimmee\"&gt;Kissimmee&lt;/a&gt; areas.\nOrlando is home to numerous recording studios and producers, and as a result, contributed heavily to the &lt;a href=\"boyband\"&gt;boyband&lt;/a&gt; craze of the mid-1990s. The groups &lt;a href=\"Backstreet%20Boys\"&gt;Backstreet Boys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NSync\"&gt;NSync&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"O-Town\"&gt;O-Town&lt;/a&gt; all started in Orlando before becoming nationwide successes. The alternative groups &lt;a href=\"Matchbox%20Twenty\"&gt;Matchbox Twenty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Mary%20Three\"&gt;Seven Mary Three&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alter%20Bridge\"&gt;Alter Bridge&lt;/a&gt; are from Orlando, as is the Christian hip-hop act &lt;a href=\"Group%201%20Crew\"&gt;Group 1 Crew&lt;/a&gt;. Orlando also has a prominent metal scene, spawning bands such as &lt;a href=\"Death%20%28metal%20band%29\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trivium%20%28band%29\"&gt;Trivium&lt;/a&gt;.\nSports.\nOrlando is the home city of two major league professional sports teams: the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Magic\"&gt;Orlando Magic&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt; (NBA), and &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20City%20SC\"&gt;Orlando City SC&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt; (MLS).\nOrlando has three minor league professional teams: the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Solar%20Bears%20%28ECHL%29\"&gt;Orlando Solar Bears&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ECHL\"&gt;ECHL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; team, the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Predators%20%28NAL%29\"&gt;Orlando Predators&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Arena%20League\"&gt;National Arena League&lt;/a&gt; (NAL), and the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Anarchy\"&gt;Orlando Anarchy&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Football%20Alliance\"&gt;Women's Football Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe original &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Solar%20Bears%20%28IHL%29\"&gt;Orlando Solar Bears&lt;/a&gt; were part of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Hockey%20League%20%281945%E2%80%932001%29\"&gt;International Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; winning the last &lt;a href=\"Turner%20Cup\"&gt;Turner Cup&lt;/a&gt; championship in 2001, before the league folded.

Several English-language stations also operate Spanish-language subchannels.\nThe city's cable system is run by &lt;a href=\"Bright%20House%20Networks\"&gt;Bright House Networks&lt;/a&gt;, which merged with &lt;a href=\"Charter%20Communications\"&gt;Charter&lt;/a&gt; in May 2016, and is now called Spectrum. Spectrum operates &lt;a href=\"News%2013\"&gt;News 13&lt;/a&gt;, a cable-exclusive regional 24/7 news channel which covers Central Florida news, including that of Orlando.\nOrlando is also home to &lt;a href=\"NBC%20Sports\"&gt;NBC Sports&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Golf%20Channel\"&gt;Golf Channel&lt;/a&gt; cable television network.

The \"Sentinel\" Spanish language edition, \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Sentinel%20%28Orlando%29\"&gt;El Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;\", is the largest Spanish language newspaper in Florida.\nThe city is also served by the following newspapers:\nTransport.\nOrlando uses the &lt;a href=\"Lynx%20%28Orlando%29\"&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt; bus system as well as a downtown bus service called Lymmo. Orlando and other neighboring communities are also serviced by &lt;a href=\"SunRail\"&gt;SunRail&lt;/a&gt;, a local commuter rail line that began service in 2014.\nRoads.\nOrlando, like other major cities, experiences gridlock and traffic jams daily, especially when commuting from the northern suburbs in &lt;a href=\"Seminole%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Seminole County&lt;/a&gt; south to downtown and from the eastern suburbs of Orange County to Downtown. Heavy traffic is also common in the tourist district south of downtown. Rush hours (peak traffic hours) are usually weekday mornings (after 7\u00a0am) and afternoons (after 4\u00a0pm). There are various traffic advisory resources available for commuters including downloading the Tele-Traffic App (available for &lt;a href=\"iPhone\"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Android%20%28operating%20system%29\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;), dialing &lt;a href=\"5-1-1\"&gt;5-1-1&lt;/a&gt; (a free automated traffic advisory system provided by the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;Florida Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt;, available by dialing 511), visiting the Florida 511 Web site, listening to traffic reports on major radio stations, and reading electronic traffic advisory displays (also called &lt;a href=\"Variable-message%20signs\"&gt;Variable-message signs&lt;/a&gt;, information is also provided by &lt;a href=\"FDOT\"&gt;FDOT&lt;/a&gt;) on the major highways and roadways.\nRail.\nThe Orlando area is served by one through railroad. The line, now known as the Central Florida Rail Corridor (CFRC), was previously known as the \"A\" line (formerly the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Line%20Railroad\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Line Railroad&lt;/a&gt;'s main line). The line was purchased from &lt;a href=\"CSX%20Transportation\"&gt;CSX Transportation&lt;/a&gt; by the State of Florida in 2013 and is now used by &lt;a href=\"SunRail\"&gt;SunRail&lt;/a&gt;, the Central Florida commuter rail system. Some freight spurs still exist off of the line, which are operated by the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Central%20Railroad%20%28current%29\"&gt;Florida Central Railroad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Amtrak\"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt; passenger service runs along CFRC. See also .\n&lt;a href=\"Amtrak\"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt; intercity &lt;a href=\"Passenger%20train\"&gt;passenger rail&lt;/a&gt; service operates from the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20%28Amtrak%20station%29\"&gt;Orlando Amtrak Station&lt;/a&gt; south of downtown. The &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Revival%20Style%20architecture\"&gt;Mission Revival-style&lt;/a&gt; station has been in continuous use since 1927, first for the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Line%20Railroad\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Line&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"Seaboard%20Coast%20Line%20Railroad\"&gt;Seaboard Coast Line Railroad&lt;/a&gt; (signage for which is still displayed over the station's main entrance). Amtrak's \"&lt;a href=\"Silver%20Meteor\"&gt;Silver Meteor&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Silver%20Star%20%28Amtrak%29\"&gt;Silver Star&lt;/a&gt;\" service Orlando four times daily, twice bound for points north to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Penn%20Station\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and twice bound for points south to &lt;a href=\"Miami%20%28Amtrak%20station%29\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;. Orlando also serves as a transfer hub for Amtrak &lt;a href=\"Thruway%20Motorcoach\"&gt;Thruway Motorcoach&lt;/a&gt; bus service. Orlando Station has the highest Amtrak ridership in the state, with the exception of the \"&lt;a href=\"Auto%20Train\"&gt;Auto Train&lt;/a&gt;\" depot located in nearby &lt;a href=\"Sanford%20%28Amtrak%20station%29\"&gt;Sanford&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistorically, Orlando's other major railroad stations have included:\nCommuter rail.\nIn 2005, federal and state funding was granted for the establishment of &lt;a href=\"SunRail\"&gt;SunRail&lt;/a&gt;, a local &lt;a href=\"commuter%20rail\"&gt;commuter rail&lt;/a&gt; service, to operate on the former CSX \"A\" line tracks between &lt;a href=\"DeLand%2C%20Florida\"&gt;DeLand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poinciana%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Poinciana&lt;/a&gt;, passing through the downtown area and surrounding urban neighborhoods along the way. The service is expected to substantially reduce traffic congestion along the I-4 corridor, especially between Downtown Orlando and the suburban communities in Seminole and Volusia Counties. Federal and state funds covered approximately 80% of the estimated $400\u00a0million cost for track modifications and construction of stations along the route. The counties involved approved local matching funds in 2007 and the line was originally projected to begin operations in 2011. However, the project was ultimately voted down by Florida State Senate in 2008 and again in 2009 due to an amendment that would have approved a $200\u00a0million insurance policy for the system. Although there had been growing concern the system would be scrapped, a deadline extension combined with a new insurance arrangement with CSX brought new hope that SunRail will be completed after all. In a special session in December 2009, the Florida Legislature approved commuter rail for Florida, which also enabled high-speed rail &lt;a href=\"Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; funding. SunRail began passenger service on May 1, 2014. Phase I of the rail system runs from &lt;a href=\"DeBary%2C%20Florida\"&gt;DeBary&lt;/a&gt; to Sand Lake Road in South Orlando. Phase II, which isn't expected to be completed until 2018, will connect from DeBary and continue north to &lt;a href=\"DeLand%2C%20Florida\"&gt;DeLand&lt;/a&gt;, as well as extend from Sand Lake Road in Orlando south to &lt;a href=\"Poinciana%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Poinciana&lt;/a&gt;. Attempts to establish a smaller &lt;a href=\"light%20rail\"&gt;light rail&lt;/a&gt; service for the Orlando area were also considered at one time, but were also met with much resistance.\nHigh-speed rail.\nOn January 28, 2010, President &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; said that Florida would be receiving $1.25\u00a0billion to start the construction of a statewide high-speed rail system with Orlando as its central hub. The first stage would have connected Orlando and Tampa, Florida and was expected to be completed by 2014. The second stage was to connect Orlando and Miami, Florida. The project was canceled by Gov. Rick Scott in 2011, and on March 4, 2011, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously turned down the request of two state senators to force Scott to accept federal funding for the project.\nA privately funded initiative known as \"All Aboard Florida\", which would provide &lt;a href=\"high-speed%20rail\"&gt;high-speed rail&lt;/a&gt; service from Miami to Orlando, was announced in March 2012. Now known as &lt;a href=\"Brightline\"&gt;Brightline&lt;/a&gt;, the train currently runs from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Lauderdale%20station%20%28Brightline%29\"&gt;Fort Lauderdale&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"West%20Palm%20Beach%20station%20%28Brightline%29\"&gt;West Palm Beach&lt;/a&gt; with service to &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Central%20Station\"&gt;Miami Central&lt;/a&gt; expected to start in early May 2018. The Orlando extension will include of new railway track and terminate at the new &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20International%20Airport%20Intermodal%20Terminal\"&gt;Orlando International Airport Intermodal Terminal&lt;/a&gt;. Top speeds are expected to reach 125 mph (201 km/h), becoming one of the fastest rail services in the United States. Service to Orlando is slated to be launched in 2022. Future plans are underway to add a terminal at &lt;a href=\"Disney%20Springs\"&gt;Disney Springs&lt;/a&gt;.\nBus.\n&lt;a href=\"Lynx%20%28Orlando%29\"&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt; provides local transit service covering a five-county area: &lt;a href=\"Orange%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seminole%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Seminole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osceola%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Osceola&lt;/a&gt;, Polk, and &lt;a href=\"Volusia%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Volusia&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Greyhound%20Lines\"&gt;Greyhound Lines&lt;/a&gt; offers intercity bus service from Orlando to multiple locations across the country. The Orlando Greyhound Station is located west of Downtown Orlando.\nHaving a very well developed tourism industry and millions of visitors per year the City of Orlando has multiple options for groups arriving and touring the city and surrounding areas. Between the most respected local charter bus companies in town you find &lt;a href=\"https%3A//atcbuses.com\"&gt;ATC Buses Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, Mears Transportation and others. Lynx bus is of most use for local residents, but their frequency varies depending on the route and time of day. So a convenient way to get to know the City of Orlando by bus is to hire a charter coach bus.\nTaxi.\nOrlando is served by a collection of independently owned taxi companies. In downtown Orlando, taxis can be hailed on a regular basis. Taxis are also available in and around the Amway Center, Orlando Convention Center, and all major attractions/theme parks. Orlando also has service from car-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft, which offer service at all airports.\nAirport shuttles.\nTransportation between the Orlando International Airport and various locations in and around Orlando is provided by airport shuttle services. Several shuttles operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nInternational relations.\nOrlando has nine international sister cities as listed by the City of Orlando Office of International Affairs.\nForeign consulates.\nGiven Orlando's status as a busy international tourist destination and growing industrial and commercial base, there are several foreign consulates and honorary consulates in Orlando including Argentina, Colombia, Czech Republic, Haiti, Mexico, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the Ivory Coast. As a result, Orlando now has the second-highest number of foreign consulates in Florida next to Miami. The British Government operated a Consulate from 1994 to 2014 when all services transferred to the British Consulate General in Miami."
