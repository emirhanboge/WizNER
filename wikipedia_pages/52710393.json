    "title": "Solar (John Abercrombie &amp; John Scofield album)",
    "text": "Solar is a studio album by jazz guitarists &lt;a href=\"John%20Abercrombie%20%28guitarist%29\"&gt;John Abercrombie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Scofield\"&gt;John Scofield&lt;/a&gt;. It was initially released in 1984 by Palo Alto Records and reissued in 2001 by West Wind.\nReception.\nKen Dryden of &lt;a href=\"Allmusic\"&gt;Allmusic&lt;/a&gt; stated \"Guitarists John Abercrombie and John Scofield join forces for these early-'80s sessions, mostly duets while occasionally adding bassist George Mraz and drummer Peter Donald. They delve into the jazz canon with an intricate duet of 'Solar', a driving, Latin-fused take of 'Four on Six' (in which Abercrombie overdubs an electric mandolin), and a dreamy duo interpretation of 'If You Could See Me Now.' The sole standard, 'I Should Care', fares just as well in their hands, which settles into a relaxed exchange between the two players as if they are playing for themselves alone. Scofield's 'Small Wonder' is scored for the quartet, a bristling post-bop vehicle with a feature for Mraz as well. Abercrombie's introspective 'Sing Song' best contrasts the styles of the two leaders, with the composer a bit more melodic and Scofield with a more brittle attack. This is an enjoyable CD that has stood the test of time very well.\"\nPersonnel.\nProduction"
