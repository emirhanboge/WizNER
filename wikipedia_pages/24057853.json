He served as &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Manchester\"&gt;Bishop of Manchester&lt;/a&gt; from 1960 to 1974.\nPrimeau was born in &lt;a href=\"Chicago%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, and there studied at &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Quigley%20Preparatory%20Seminary\"&gt;Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary&lt;/a&gt;. He was &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Orders\"&gt;ordained&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Priesthood%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;priesthood&lt;/a&gt; by Cardinal &lt;a href=\"George%20Mundelein\"&gt;George Mundelein&lt;/a&gt; on April 7, 1934. After serving at &lt;a href=\"Parish%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;parishes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20school\"&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;Archdiocese of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, he spent twelve years in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, and was &lt;a href=\"Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29\"&gt;rector&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Saint%20Mary%20of%20the%20Lake\"&gt;Mundelein Seminary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;Chicago's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diocese\"&gt;Archdiocesan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"seminary\"&gt;seminary&lt;/a&gt;.

He received his &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;episcopal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"consecration\"&gt;consecration&lt;/a&gt; on February 13, 1960 from Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Gregory%20Meyer\"&gt;Albert Gregory Meyer&lt;/a&gt;, with Bishops &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Dewey%20McNamara\"&gt;Martin Dewey McNamara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20Peter%20Hillinger\"&gt;Raymond Peter Hillinger&lt;/a&gt; serving as &lt;a href=\"Consecrator\"&gt;co-consecrators&lt;/a&gt;.

During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Vatican%20Council\"&gt;Second Vatican Council&lt;/a&gt; (1962-1965), Primeau was one of the more influential and articulate voices among the Council Fathers. He spoke out in support of the empowerment of the &lt;a href=\"laity\"&gt;laity&lt;/a&gt;, once declaring, \"Let this talk of their duty of subjection cease.\" He also founded the first foreign &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20missions\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; of the diocese in 1963 in &lt;a href=\"Cartago%2C%20Colombia\"&gt;Cartago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;. During Primeau's tenure, the number of Catholics increased by 43,000 and the number of parishes by 11; however, weekly &lt;a href=\"Mass%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;Mass&lt;/a&gt; attendance declined from over 70% to below 50%.\nAfter thirteen years as bishop, he retired on January 30, 1974 at the age of 65. He had often advocated that bishops should retire at that age and so he became the first Bishop of Manchester to resign from office. Primeau died in 1989 at age 79."
