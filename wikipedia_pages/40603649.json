    "text": "Francis Weld Peabody (1881\u20131927) was an American physician born November 24, 1881, in &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. He was known for his research into &lt;a href=\"poliomyelitis\"&gt;poliomyelitis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"typhoid\"&gt;typhoid&lt;/a&gt;, and celebrated as a teacher at &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Medical%20School\"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;. .\nEarly life and education.\nPeabody was the third of four children: William, Gertrude, Francis, and John. His father, &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Greenwood%20Peabody\"&gt;Francis Greenwood Peabody&lt;/a&gt;, (1847\u20131936) was a Harvard graduate and minister\nHe finished his formal schooling in 1898, graduating with mediocre grades from the &lt;a href=\"Buckingham%20Browne%20%26amp%3B%20Nichols%20School\"&gt;Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, . In May, 1899, both Francis and his younger brother John were stricken with typhoid while on vacation in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, Italy. The younger brother died on May 27. It is believed that the death of his younger brother played a role in Francis\u2019 decision to choose medicine as a career.\nHe graduated from &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20College\"&gt;Harvard College&lt;/a&gt; in 1903 and entered &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Medical%20School\"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt; in September. Despite his unremarkable academic record up to this point, he excelled in medical school. During his studies, he distinguished himself as a compassionate clinician, committing long hours to case studies and devoting his attention to each patient he came into contact with. He graduated in June 1907 with honors.\nAfter graduating from medical school, he served a one-year internship on the Medical Service of the Massachusetts General Hospital.\nMedical career.\nIn 1910 he worked in Germany, at the chemistry laboratory of &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Joseph%20Emil%20Fischer\"&gt;Franz Joseph Emil Fischer&lt;/a&gt;. From 1912-1915 he worked at the &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Bent%20Brigham%20Hospital\"&gt;Peter Bent Brigham Hospital&lt;/a&gt; as a resident physician. In 1915 he became an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and in 1921 he became a professor there.\nHe made significant contributions to understanding &lt;a href=\"pernicious%20anemia\"&gt;pernicious anemia&lt;/a&gt; while doing research at the &lt;a href=\"Harvard-Thorndike%20Laboratory\"&gt;Harvard-Thorndike Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong his postings, he worked at distinguished hospitals including Johns Hopkins, Rockefeller Hospital, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, and Boston City Hospital.\nOverseas travels.\nPeabody arrived in Peking, China on April 18, 1914 for an extensive medical trip, and after returning home for nearly three years, left for Romania in August 1917 on a Red Cross Commission during World War I. In February 1918, the Romanian government ended hostilities with Germany and the German government ordered all French, British and American relief operations to leave the country. . Peabody left Romania and travelled to Moscow, where he arrived in November 1917, in order to acquire supplies for his hospital in Romania before the German takeover. Housed in a hotel-turned-hospital near the Kremlin, he became a refugee and eyewitness to the Bolshevik Revolution. He finally returned home unharmed in early 1918.\nMarriage and family life.\nFrancis W. Peabody married Virginia Chandler on December 19, 1919. Together they had two sons: Francis Weld Peabody Jr. and Grigsby Chandler Peabody, born on April 22, 1924, and December 16, 1925, respectively.\n\"The Care of the Patient\".\n\"One of the essential qualities of the clinician is interest in humanity, for the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.\"\nDr. Francis Peabody is most often quoted in his essay \"The Care of the Patient\", which first appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20the%20American%20Medical%20Association\"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;. Since it was published, it has become part of medical school curriculum and is said to be as valid today as it was at the time he first presented it. He also published another essay, \"The Patient and the Man\", which presented his ideas along the same line.\nDeath and afterward.\nPeabody died of cancer on October 13, 1927. While stricken, on his death bead, he wrote objectively about the effects of &lt;a href=\"morphine\"&gt;morphine&lt;/a&gt;, which is also a widely cited essay."
