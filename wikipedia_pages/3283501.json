    "text": "The cuisine of &lt;a href=\"Botswana\"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt; is unique but shares some characteristics with other cuisines of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Africa\"&gt;Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Examples of &lt;a href=\"Setswana\"&gt;Setswana&lt;/a&gt; food include \"&lt;a href=\"Pap%20%28food%29\"&gt;pap&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"samp\"&gt;samp&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"vetkoek\"&gt;vetkoek&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Bogobe%20jwa%20lerotse\"&gt;bogobe&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Gonimbrasia%20belina%23As%20food\"&gt;mophane worms&lt;/a&gt;. A food unique to Botswana is \"&lt;a href=\"seswaa\"&gt;seswaa&lt;/a&gt;\", salted mashed-up meat.\nWatermelons are believed to have originated in Botswana. Other foods include \"morogo wa dinawa\", \"madila\" and \"&lt;a href=\"dikgobe\"&gt;dikgobe&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIt makes Batswana proud to have their own type of food. Batswana get most of the relish locally. These include beef, goat meat, sheep, tswana chicken, Mophane worms and fish. Batswana also make home made refreshing drinks using water melon, morula and ginger powder. At weddings, sorghum meal is usually cooked and mixed with melon and this mixture is called Bogobe jwa lerotse. Usually the melon is pre prepared with sour milk and stored to be used whenever needed. Batswana are also good in &lt;a href=\"food%20preservation\"&gt;food preservation&lt;/a&gt;. Among others they preserve meat by cutting it into small lengths like strings then dry it. When meat is like this, it is called digwapa. They also fetch bean leaves, cook and dry them. It is also common among Batswana to make Mageu from leftover porridge or pap. Some tribes also preserve not very bad or rotten meat by drying it to be used as relish for a long time. This type of meat is called Mokungwana. Other food prepared during weddings are samp mixed with beans or cooked without beans and eaten with pounded meat called Seswaa.\nBatswana value their food from time immemorial. They consider it as part of their culture just like clothes and language.\nIngredients.\nThe markets of Botswana are filled with a large variety of foods. Some are grown locally using irrigation and some are imported from neighbouring countries. A large quantity of high-quality &lt;a href=\"beef\"&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt; is raised in Botswana. &lt;a href=\"Lamb%20and%20mutton\"&gt;Lamb, mutton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;s are also plentiful. Beef is the most popular meat, followed by goat meat. River &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; are also part of Botswana cuisine.\n&lt;a href=\"Sorghum\"&gt;Sorghum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; are the main crops grown in Botswana. &lt;a href=\"Wheat\"&gt;Wheat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt; and other kinds of &lt;a href=\"cereal\"&gt;cereal&lt;/a&gt;s not grown locally are imported. Many different kinds of beans are grown, including &lt;a href=\"cowpea\"&gt;cowpea&lt;/a&gt;s, \"&lt;a href=\"Peanuts\"&gt;ditloo&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"letlhodi\" (&lt;a href=\"mung%20beans\"&gt;mung beans&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Peanut\"&gt;Peanut&lt;/a&gt;s (\"manoko\") are also grown. Many vegetables are grown, such as &lt;a href=\"spinach\"&gt;spinach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cabbage\"&gt;cabbage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"onion\"&gt;onion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"tomato\"&gt;tomato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"sweet%20potato\"&gt;sweet potato&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"lettuce\"&gt;lettuce&lt;/a&gt;. There are some vegetables that grow in the wild that are available seasonally including \"&lt;a href=\"Amaranth\"&gt;thepe&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"delele\"&gt;delele&lt;/a&gt;\" (okra). Dried bean leaves are a popular Setswana food.\nMany fruits are locally available, including \"&lt;a href=\"Sclerocarya%20birrea\"&gt;marula&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Watermelon\"&gt;Watermelon&lt;/a&gt;s, believed to have come originally from Botswana, are plentiful in season. Another kind of melon, called \"lerotse\" or \"lekatane\", is also grown. There are some kinds of wild melon found in sandy &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; areas which are an important food and water source for the people who live in those areas. Many vegetables are seasonal and are often &lt;a href=\"Drying%20%28food%29\"&gt;dried&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Salting%20%28food%29\"&gt;salted&lt;/a&gt; for preservation. There are many different ways of cooking dried vegetables.\nPopular dishes.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Seswaa\"&gt;Seswaa&lt;/a&gt;\", \"tshotlho\" or \"leswao\" (pounded beef) is a very popular traditional meat dish made for most special occasions. Usually prepared by men, it is cooked in a three-legged iron pot, simmered until soft, with only salt, cooking oil and water. It is usually prepared using goat meat or beef and it is a staple in most traditional occasions such as funerals and weddings.\nAnother type is \"serobe\", in which the intestines and some offals of goat, sheep or cow are cooked until soft. Before cooking, the intestines are thoroughly washed. If the animal is sheep or goat, the &lt;a href=\"Pig%27s%20trotters\"&gt;trotters&lt;/a&gt; are included. For this food to be serobe, a scissor used to cut meat is used to cut the intestines into small pieces.\nThe other type of meat is of chicken. Traditionally grown chicken (&lt;a href=\"free-range\"&gt;free-range&lt;/a&gt;) is considered to be tastier than commercially grown chickens. By cooking a traditionally grown chicken for a guest, a host shows special hospitality. Cooking chicken in a three-legged iron pot on an open fire gives it the best flavour. Chicken meat is usually eaten with dumplings or pap.\n\"Bogobe\" is made by putting sorghum, maize or &lt;a href=\"millet\"&gt;millet&lt;/a&gt; flour into boiling water, stirring into a soft paste, and then cooking it slowly. Sometimes the sorghum or maize is fermented before cooking for some days to make it sour. This dish is called \"ting\". This sour porridge can be cooked and eaten with meat or milk and sugar. Without the milk and sugar, \"ting\" &lt;a href=\"Bogobe%20jwa%20lerotse\"&gt;Another way&lt;/a&gt; of making \"bogobe\" is to add sour milk and a cooking melon (\"lerotse\"). This dish is called \"tophi\" by the Kalanga tribe.\nBread flour is not part of the basic diet, but has been imported for some years, so there are various bread recipes that have become part of the national food. The most common are dumplings (\"matlebekwane\"or madombi), flat cakes (\"diphaphatha\") and fat cakes (\"magwinya\"). For these, the flour is made into dough which is cooked in different ways such as boiling with meat, cooking in hot oil or on hot coals putting on a pot lead. \nPopular foods in remote areas include &lt;a href=\"morama%20bean\"&gt;morama bean&lt;/a&gt;, a huge underground &lt;a href=\"tuber\"&gt;tuber&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Edible%20mushroom\"&gt;edible fungus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mopane%20worm\"&gt;Mopane worm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"caterpillar\"&gt;caterpillar&lt;/a&gt; of the moth \"&lt;a href=\"Gonimbrasia%20belina\"&gt;Gonimbrasia belina&lt;/a&gt;\", is cooked in hot ashes, boiled, or dried and fried.\nBeverages.\nMany &lt;a href=\"soft%20drink\"&gt;soft drink&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"alcohol%20%28drug%29\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;ic drinks are produced in factories in Botswana, including &lt;a href=\"Fanta\"&gt;Fanta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coca-Cola\"&gt;Coca-Cola&lt;/a&gt;. Local brands are Castle and Lion &lt;a href=\"beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Milk\"&gt;Milk&lt;/a&gt; is fermented to make \"madila\" (&lt;a href=\"sour%20milk\"&gt;sour milk&lt;/a&gt;) which is eaten on its own or added to &lt;a href=\"porridge\"&gt;porridge&lt;/a&gt;. A favorite non-alcoholic homemade drink is &lt;a href=\"ginger%20beer\"&gt;ginger beer&lt;/a&gt;.This drink is popularly served at special occasions like weddings and parties. It is prepared by boiling ginger powder in water, adding tartaric acid and cream of tartar then left to cool and fermented for one day.\nThere are various traditionally produced alcoholic drinks. \"Bojalwa ja Setswana\" (the beer of Botswana) is brewed from fermented sorghum seeds. Other tribes, like &lt;a href=\"Bakalanga\"&gt;Bakalanga&lt;/a&gt;, use \"lebelebele\" (&lt;a href=\"millet\"&gt;millet&lt;/a&gt;). A commercially produced and packaged beer, &lt;a href=\"Chibuku\"&gt;Chibuku&lt;/a&gt;, brewed from either &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sorghum\"&gt;sorghum&lt;/a&gt;, is a favourite drink particularly in the villages, towns, and in some parts of the city. Chibuku is also brewed in other neighbouring countries such as &lt;a href=\"Malawi\"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Umqombothi\"&gt;Umqombothi&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Zambia\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;. \"Khadi\", which is brewed from various ingredients, the healthiest of which is wild berries, is also a widely consumed alcoholic drink among low-income groups in particular.\nThere are other beverages such as mints called kgomodimetsing and longman. These are leaves which are usually mixed with tea for a good scented taste."
