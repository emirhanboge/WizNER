    "text": "Jim McDonnell (born 12 September 1960) is a British former &lt;a href=\"Boxing\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt; who won the European &lt;a href=\"featherweight\"&gt;featherweight&lt;/a&gt; title and twice fought for World titles at &lt;a href=\"super%20featherweight\"&gt;super featherweight&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nAmateur.\nHe represented &lt;a href=\"England%20at%20the%201982%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and won a &lt;a href=\"silver%20medal\"&gt;silver medal&lt;/a&gt; in the lightweight division, at the &lt;a href=\"1982%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;1982 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brisbane\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. He won the 1982 &lt;a href=\"England%20Boxing\"&gt;Amateur Boxing Association&lt;/a&gt; British &lt;a href=\"England%20Boxing%20National%20Amateur%20Championships%20Lightweight%20Champions\"&gt;lightweight title&lt;/a&gt;, when boxing out of the St. Pancras ABC.\nProfessional.\nBorn in London and a &lt;a href=\"Janitor\"&gt;caretaker&lt;/a&gt; working for &lt;a href=\"Camden%20London%20Borough%20Council\"&gt;Camden Council&lt;/a&gt; outside of boxing, McDonnell made his professional debut in March 1983 with a points win over Phil Duke. In March 1985 he beat &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20Ruan\"&gt;Clyde Ruan&lt;/a&gt; to take the &lt;a href=\"BBBofC\"&gt;BBBofC&lt;/a&gt; Southern Area featherweight title, a fight that was also a British title eliminator.\nThe British title fight didn't materialise but in November 1985 he faced &lt;a href=\"Jose%20Luis%20Vicho\"&gt;Jose Luis Vicho&lt;/a&gt; for the vacant European featherweight title; McDonnell stopped the Spaniard in the fourth round to become European champion. He successfully defended the European title in July 1986 against &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Bottiglieri\"&gt;Salvatore Bottiglieri&lt;/a&gt;, taking a points decision.\nBy 1988 he had moved up to super featherweight and still with a 100% record from 24 fights fought South African &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Mitchell%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Brian Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; for the latter's &lt;a href=\"World%20Boxing%20Association\"&gt;WBA&lt;/a&gt; super featherweight title in November. The fight went the full twelve rounds but Mitchell won via a comfortable unanimous decision, the first defeat of McDonnell's career.\nMcDonnell returned in March 1989 with a points win over &lt;a href=\"Benjie%20Marquez\"&gt;Benjie Marquez&lt;/a&gt;, and in May of that year faced &lt;a href=\"Barry%20McGuigan\"&gt;Barry McGuigan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"G-Mex%20Centre\"&gt;G-Mex Centre&lt;/a&gt;, Manchester. Although the underdog, McDonnell dominated the fight and won after it was stopped in the fourth round due to a cut over McGuigan's right eye. The defeat effectively ended McGuigan's career.\nIn November 1989 McDonnell got a second shot at a World title when he challenged for &lt;a href=\"Azumah%20Nelson\"&gt;Azumah Nelson&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"World%20Boxing%20Council\"&gt;WBC&lt;/a&gt; super featherweight title at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Albert%20Hall\"&gt;Royal Albert Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Nelson had McDonnell down four times and stopped him in the twelfth and final round.\nHe returned in September 1990 when he was stopped by future WBF World champion &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Vice\"&gt;Kenny Vice&lt;/a&gt; in the fourth round. After more than seven years out of the ring, and at the age of 38, he returned in February 1998 against Peter Feher, losing a six-round points decision.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retiring from boxing he worked as a painter and decorator, ran a gym in &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Camden\"&gt;Camden&lt;/a&gt;, and became a trainer, most notably working with &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Williams%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Danny Williams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20DeGale\"&gt;James DeGale&lt;/a&gt;. He also ran the &lt;a href=\"London%20Marathon\"&gt;London Marathon&lt;/a&gt; several times, his best time 2 hours 49 minutes."
