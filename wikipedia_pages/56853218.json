    "text": "Chikanda is a &lt;a href=\"Zambia\"&gt;Zambian&lt;/a&gt; dish made from the boiled root &lt;a href=\"Tuber\"&gt;tubers&lt;/a&gt; of terrestrial &lt;a href=\"Orchidaceae\"&gt;orchids&lt;/a&gt; also called \"chikanda\". The dish is often called \"African polony\" because it has a texture that resembles &lt;a href=\"Bologna%20sausage\"&gt;bologna&lt;/a&gt;. Chikanda can be eaten as a &lt;a href=\"snack\"&gt;snack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dessert\"&gt;dessert&lt;/a&gt;, or an accompaniment to &lt;a href=\"Ugali\"&gt;\"nshima\"&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; flour &lt;a href=\"porridge\"&gt;porridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nChikanda has been eaten for hundreds of years by people in parts of Zambia, northern &lt;a href=\"Malawi\"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt;, and southwestern &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;. The dish is traditionally associated with the &lt;a href=\"Bemba%20people\"&gt;Bemba&lt;/a&gt; tribe in northeast Zambia, although it is eaten throughout Zambia today. For the Bemba, it is an integral part of the culture and is served at special occasions such as &lt;a href=\"Wedding\"&gt;weddings&lt;/a&gt;. Originally a &lt;a href=\"Famine%20food\"&gt;food in the setting of rural scarcity&lt;/a&gt;, it has now shifted to an urban trend. Now, chikanda can be found being sold by &lt;a href=\"Hawker%20%28trade%29\"&gt;street vendors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Supermarket\"&gt;supermarkets&lt;/a&gt;, and large &lt;a href=\"Restaurant\"&gt;restaurants&lt;/a&gt; as the urban population has an increased demand for this rural tradition.\nIn Malawi, it is thought that eating the dish will protect against sickness.\nIn southwestern Tanzania, a similar dish called \"kinaka\" in &lt;a href=\"Swahili%20language\"&gt;Kiswahili&lt;/a&gt; are eaten by the &lt;a href=\"Kyenjojo%20District\"&gt;Nyamwanga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mijikenda%20peoples\"&gt;Nyika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nyiha%20people\"&gt;Nyiha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fipa%20people\"&gt;Fipa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lungu%20people\"&gt;Lungu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ndali%20people\"&gt;Ndali&lt;/a&gt;.\nIngredients.\nThere are many different &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of orchids used, but primarily from the \"&lt;a href=\"Disa%20%28plant%29\"&gt;Disa&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Habenaria\"&gt;Habenaria&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Satyrium%20%28plant%29\"&gt;Satyrium&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Genus\"&gt;genera&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers determined that 16 orchid species in 6 genera are in the \"chikanda\" trade. The orchid roots resemble the shape of an &lt;a href=\"Potato\"&gt;Irish potato&lt;/a&gt; but is smaller in size. The &lt;a href=\"ash\"&gt;ash&lt;/a&gt; water or &lt;a href=\"Sodium%20bicarbonate\"&gt;baking soda&lt;/a&gt; with their &lt;a href=\"Base%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;high pH&lt;/a&gt; likely provides supplemental &lt;a href=\"Mineral\"&gt;minerals&lt;/a&gt; and leads to the soapy taste and firm texture of \"chikanda\".\nPreparation.\nThe tubers are dried and pounded. Then, a mixture of the dried brown orchid meal and &lt;a href=\"Peanut\"&gt;groundnut&lt;/a&gt; meal are boiled to form a &lt;a href=\"slurry\"&gt;slurry&lt;/a&gt;. Dried &lt;a href=\"Chili%20pepper\"&gt;chili peppers&lt;/a&gt; can also be added. The slurry is thickened by soda, salted, and flavored with spices. As it simmers, the slurry thickens into a cake and rises like dough. It is usually served sliced.\nSustainability issues.\nThe orchid roots grow wild throughout Zambia. However, due to the high demand, this had led to the present scarcity of the orchids in the country. Now, they are illegally &lt;a href=\"Import\"&gt;imported&lt;/a&gt; from Tanzania, &lt;a href=\"Angola\"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the risk of &lt;a href=\"Overexploitation\"&gt;overharvesting&lt;/a&gt; abroad. Traditional sustainability practices included only harvested tubers that have spread their seed and replanting stalks. However, the locals have abandoned these practices due to increased demand. Unfortunately, the orchids are difficult to &lt;a href=\"Agriculture\"&gt;cultivate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"captivity\"&gt;captivity&lt;/a&gt;. Current efforts for &lt;a href=\"Conservation%20biology\"&gt;conservation&lt;/a&gt; focus on cultivating the threatened orchids.\nA similar issue with unsustainable harvesting of orchids is noted with the &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; trade in \"&lt;a href=\"salep\"&gt;salep&lt;/a&gt;\", a starch used in dessert and &lt;a href=\"Drink\"&gt;beverages&lt;/a&gt;."
