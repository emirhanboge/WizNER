    "text": "Buddhism includes a wide array of &lt;a href=\"Deity\"&gt;divine beings&lt;/a&gt; that are venerated in various ritual and popular contexts. Initially they included mainly Indian figures such as &lt;a href=\"Deva%20%28Hinduism%29\"&gt;devas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"asura\"&gt;asura&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"yakshas\"&gt;yakshas&lt;/a&gt;, but later came to include other Asian spirits and local gods (like the Burmese &lt;a href=\"Nat%20%28deity%29\"&gt;\"nats\"&lt;/a&gt;). They range from enlightened &lt;a href=\"Buddhahood\"&gt;Buddhas&lt;/a&gt; to regional spirits adopted by Buddhists or practiced on the margins of the religion. Notably, Buddhism &lt;a href=\"Creator%20in%20Buddhism\"&gt;lacks a supreme creator deity&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuddhists later also came to incorporate aspects from the countries to which it spread. As such, it includes many aspects taken from other mythologies of those cultures.\nBuddhas.\nA &lt;a href=\"Buddhahood\"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; is a being who is fully &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;awakened&lt;/a&gt; and has fully comprehended the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Noble%20Truths\"&gt;Four Noble Truths&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Theravada\"&gt;Theravada&lt;/a&gt; tradition, while there is a list of acknowledged past Buddhas, the historical Buddha &lt;a href=\"Sakyamuni\"&gt;Sakyamuni&lt;/a&gt; is the only Buddha of our current era and is generally not seen as accessible or as existing in some higher plane of existence. The &lt;a href=\"Pali%20literature\"&gt;Pali literature&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Theravada\"&gt;Therav\u0101da&lt;/a&gt; tradition includes tales of &lt;a href=\"Buddhahood%23The%2029%20Buddhas%20of%20Therav%C4%81da\"&gt;twenty-nine Buddhas&lt;/a&gt;, which are &lt;a href=\"Sakyamuni\"&gt;Sakyamuni&lt;/a&gt; and the twenty-eight Buddhas who preceded him.\n&lt;a href=\"Mahayana\"&gt;Mahayana&lt;/a&gt; Buddhists venerate numerous Buddhas, more so than the Theravada tradition, including &lt;a href=\"Maitreya\"&gt;Maitreya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amit%C4%81bha\"&gt;Amit\u0101bha&lt;/a&gt;, who are seen as beings of great wisdom and power who preside over &lt;a href=\"pure%20land\"&gt;pure land&lt;/a&gt;s that one can travel to after death. Mahayana and &lt;a href=\"Vajrayana\"&gt;Vajrayana&lt;/a&gt; traditions also recognize &lt;a href=\"Five%20Tathagatas\"&gt;five primary Buddhas&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Vairocana\"&gt;Vairocana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aksobhya\"&gt;Aksobhya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ratnasambhava\"&gt;Ratnasambhava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amit%C4%81bha\"&gt;Amit\u0101bha&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Amoghasiddhi\"&gt;Amoghasiddhi&lt;/a&gt;. Each is associated with a different consort, direction, aggregate (or, aspect of the personality), emotion, element, color, symbol, and mount. Other Buddhas besides these five include &lt;a href=\"Bhaisajyaguru\"&gt;Bhaisajyaguru&lt;/a&gt; (the Buddha of medicine) and Nageshvara Raja (the king of the &lt;a href=\"N%C4%81ga\"&gt;N\u0101ga&lt;/a&gt;s). There is also the idea of the &lt;a href=\"Adi-Buddha\"&gt;Adi-Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, the \"first Buddha\" to attain &lt;a href=\"Buddhahood\"&gt;Buddhahood&lt;/a&gt;. Variously named as &lt;a href=\"Vajradhara\"&gt;Vajradhara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samantabhadra%20%28Bodhisattva%29\"&gt;Samantabhadra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vairocana\"&gt;Vairocana&lt;/a&gt;, the first Buddha is also associated with the concept of &lt;a href=\"Dharmakaya\"&gt;Dharmakaya&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20Buddhism\"&gt;Tibetan Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, several female Buddhas are also recognized, such as &lt;a href=\"Tara%20%28Buddhism%29\"&gt;Tara&lt;/a&gt;, the most popular female Buddha in &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20Buddhism\"&gt;Tibetan Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, who comes in many forms and colors. Other female Buddha figures include &lt;a href=\"Vajrayogini\"&gt;Vajrayogini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nairatmya\"&gt;Nairatmya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kurukull%C4%81\"&gt;Kurukull\u0101&lt;/a&gt;. Some historical figures are also seen as Buddhas, such as the Buddhist philosopher &lt;a href=\"Nagarjuna\"&gt;Nagarjuna&lt;/a&gt; and the figure of &lt;a href=\"Padmasambhava\"&gt;Padmasambhava&lt;/a&gt;.\nBodhisattvas.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Theravada\"&gt;Theravada Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, \"bodhisatta\" is a term used mainly for Sakyamuni Buddha before his awakening. It is also commonly believed that the future Buddha, &lt;a href=\"Maitreya\"&gt;Maitreya&lt;/a&gt; (Pali: Metteya) currently resides in &lt;a href=\"Tr%C4%81yastri%E1%B9%83%C5%9Ba\"&gt;Tavatimsa&lt;/a&gt; Heaven, and this figure is one of the few bodhisattvas who have a prominent place in Theravada.\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, a &lt;a href=\"bodhisattva\"&gt;bodhisattva&lt;/a&gt; is any being that has aroused &lt;a href=\"bodhicitta\"&gt;bodhicitta&lt;/a&gt; (mind of awakening) and is thus working towards full &lt;a href=\"Buddhahood\"&gt;Buddhahood&lt;/a&gt;. Bodhisattvas who are seen as powerful and highly advanced are highly venerated in this tradition. In the &lt;a href=\"East%20Asian%20Buddhism\"&gt;East Asian Buddhist traditions&lt;/a&gt;, which are mainly Mahayana, major bodhisattvas include: &lt;a href=\"Guanyin\"&gt;Guanyin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maitreya\"&gt;Maitreya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samantabhadra%20%28Bodhisattva%29\"&gt;Samantabhadra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manjushri\"&gt;Manjushri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K%E1%B9%A3itigarbha\"&gt;Ksitigarbha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mahasthamaprapta\"&gt;Mahasthamaprapta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vajrapani\"&gt;Vajrapani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akasagarbha\"&gt;Akasagarbha&lt;/a&gt;. Others bodhisattvas include &lt;a href=\"Candraprabha\"&gt;Candraprabha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suryaprabha\"&gt;Suryaprabha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bhai%E1%B9%A3ajyasamudgata\"&gt;Bhai\u1e63ajyasamudgata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bhai%E1%B9%A3ajyar%C4%81ja\"&gt;Bhai\u1e63ajyar\u0101ja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ak%E1%B9%A3ayamati\"&gt;Ak\u1e63ayamati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sarvaniv%C4%81ra%E1%B9%87avi%E1%B9%A3kambhin\"&gt;Sarvaniv\u0101ra\u1e47avi\u1e63kambhin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vajrasattva\"&gt;Vajrasattva&lt;/a&gt;. The most popular bodhisattva in the East Asian pantheon is &lt;a href=\"Guanyin\"&gt;Guanyin&lt;/a&gt; (the East Asian form of the Indian &lt;a href=\"Avalokite%C5%9Bvara\"&gt;Avalokitesvara&lt;/a&gt;), who is also believed by Buddhists to take on numerous manifestations, among which are several other bodhisattvas such as &lt;a href=\"Cundi%20%28Buddhism%29\"&gt;Cundi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cint%C4%81ma%E1%B9%87icakra\"&gt;Cintamanicakra&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Buddhist traditions in different countries have also absorbed native deities into their localized Buddhist pantheon, sometimes as Bodhisattvas. Some examples are &lt;a href=\"Guan%20Yu\"&gt;Guan Yu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Buddhism\"&gt;Chinese Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, who is venerated as Sangharama Bodhisattva (&lt;a href=\"Chinese%20language\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: \u4f3d\u85cd\u83e9\u85a9; &lt;a href=\"Pinyin\"&gt;Pinyin&lt;/a&gt;: \"Qi\u00e9l\u00e1n P\u00fas\u00e0\") as well as a deity, and &lt;a href=\"Hachiman\"&gt;Hachiman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20buddhism\"&gt;Japanese Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, who is venerated as the Bodhisattva Hachiman (&lt;a href=\"Japanese%20language\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt;: \u516b\u5e61\u5927\u83e9\u85a9; &lt;a href=\"Romanization%20of%20Japanese\"&gt;Romanji&lt;/a&gt;: \"Hachiman Daibosatsu\").\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, a &lt;a href=\"Vajrayana\"&gt;Vajrayana Buddhist tradition&lt;/a&gt;, the major bodhisattvas are known as the \"eight great bodhisattvas\": &lt;a href=\"Ksitigarbha\"&gt;Ksitigarbha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vajrapani\"&gt;Vajrapani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akasagarbha\"&gt;Akasagarbha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avalokitesvara\"&gt;Avalokitesvara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maitreya\"&gt;Maitreya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sarvaniv%C4%81ra%E1%B9%87avi%E1%B9%A3kambhin\"&gt;Sarvaniv\u0101ra\u1e47avi\u1e63kambhin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samantabhadra%20%28Bodhisattva%29\"&gt;Samantabhadra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manjushri\"&gt;Manjushri&lt;/a&gt;. Other female Bodhisattvas include &lt;a href=\"Vasudhara\"&gt;Vasudhara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cundi%20%28Buddhism%29\"&gt;Cundi&lt;/a&gt;. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider reborn &lt;a href=\"tulkus\"&gt;tulkus&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"Dalai%20Lamas\"&gt;Dalai Lamas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Karmapa\"&gt;Karmapa&lt;/a&gt;s to be emanations of bodhisattvas.\nWisdom Kings.\nThe Wisdom Kings (Vidy\u0101r\u0101ja) are beings that are venerated in East Asian Buddhism and in Vajrayana Buddhism. They are often depicted with an aggressive or fierce appearance which symbolizes their power to get rid of negative forces. They are therefore an expression of the Buddha's compassion.\nIn East Asian Buddhism, The &lt;a href=\"Five%20Wisdom%20Kings\"&gt;Five Wisdom Kings&lt;/a&gt; are often seen as emanations of the Buddhas. These five are:\nOther important Wisdom Kings include\nYidam.\nThe yidam, or ishta-devata, is a personal meditation deity. The &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; word ' or ' is defined by V. S. Apte as \"a favorite god, one's &lt;a href=\"tutelary%20deity\"&gt;tutelary deity&lt;/a&gt;.\" Though this term is used in many popular books on Buddhist Tantra, the term \"i\u015f\u0163adevat\u0101\" has not been attested in any Buddhist tantric text in Sanskrit. The unrelated Tibetan version of the term, possibly of entirely native origin, is \"yi-dam\" is said to be a contraction of Tib. \"yid-kyi-dam-tshig\", meaning \"&lt;a href=\"samaya\"&gt;samaya&lt;/a&gt; of mind\"- in other words, the state of being indestructibly bonded with the inherently pure and liberated nature of mind.\nThe ishta-devata of Hinduism is an aspect of God for personal worship. In Buddhism, a yidam is a manifestation of &lt;a href=\"Enlightenment%20in%20Buddhism\"&gt;enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; and may take the form of &lt;a href=\"Sambhogak%C4%81ya\"&gt;Sambhogak\u0101ya&lt;/a&gt; Buddhas, tantric deities such as &lt;a href=\"Dakini\"&gt;Dakini&lt;/a&gt;s, bodhisattvas, Dharma protectors (&lt;a href=\"Dharmapala\"&gt;Dharmapala&lt;/a&gt;s) or other historical figures such as past gurus or religious leaders.\nWrathful deities.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Buddhist%20Tantras\"&gt;Buddhist Tantras&lt;/a&gt;, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas often manifest in unusual and fierce forms, which are used in tantra as &lt;a href=\"yidams\"&gt;yidams&lt;/a&gt; or meditation deities.\nWhile some of these deities have a hideous and fierce appearance, they are not personifications of evil or demonic forces. The ferocious appearance of these deities is used to instill fear in evil spirits which threaten the Dharma.\nDivine beings.\nDevas.\nDevas are divine beings, though they are not all necessarily wise or on the Buddhist path and hence not final objects of refuge. They have very long lives which have much less suffering than humans, but are not immortal or immune from suffering. Some devas have no physical form and exist in the formless realms. None of them are &lt;a href=\"Creator%20in%20Buddhism\"&gt;creator gods&lt;/a&gt;, and they are neither &lt;a href=\"Omniscience\"&gt;omniscient&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Omnipotence\"&gt;omnipotent&lt;/a&gt;. With the spread of Buddhism, different cultures have also integrated or syncretized local deities into their pantheon of devas. For example, Chinese Buddhism venerates the &lt;a href=\"Twenty-Four%20Protective%20Deities\"&gt;Twenty-Four Protective Devas&lt;/a&gt;, which include both originally Indian deities, such as &lt;a href=\"Mahe%C5%9Bvara%20%28Buddhism%29\"&gt;Mahesvara&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Shiva\"&gt;Shiva&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Aakra%20%28Buddhism%29\"&gt;Sakra&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Indra\"&gt;Indra&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Brahm%C4%81%20%28Buddhism%29\"&gt;Brahma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sarasvati\"&gt;Sarasvati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laksmi\"&gt;Laksmi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marici%20%28Buddhism%29\"&gt;Marici&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hariti\"&gt;Hariti&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a few deities integrated from &lt;a href=\"Taoism\"&gt;Taoism&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Zi%20wei%20emperor\"&gt;Emperor Zi Wei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leigong\"&gt;Leigong&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Guan%20Yu\"&gt;Guan Yu&lt;/a&gt;, who is regarded as a god of war in &lt;a href=\"Taoism\"&gt;Taoism&lt;/a&gt;, is also regarded as both a bodhisattva and a deva. In &lt;a href=\"Buddhism%20in%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shinto\"&gt;Shinto&lt;/a&gt; gods were also syncretized into the pantheon under the &lt;a href=\"honji%20suijaku\"&gt;honji suijaku&lt;/a&gt; theory by being conflated with the Indian deities imported from Buddhism, such as &lt;a href=\"Ugajin\"&gt;Ugajin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C5%8Ckuninushi\"&gt;\u014ckuninushi&lt;/a&gt;.\nAsuras.\nThe Asuras, sometimes translated as Titans or Demigods, are often depicted as enemies of the Devas and fighting them in wars. They are said to have been defeated by the Devas, led by Sakra, king of the gods. They are often seen as being led by strong passions, such as hatred and greed.\nM\u0101ra.\nM\u0101ra (literally meaning \"death\") refers to either a specific being, or to a class of beings, who are depicted as being antagonistic to the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. As lord of the desire realm, M\u0101ra is depicted as working to keep beings under his control.\nC\u0101turmah\u0101r\u0101jak\u0101yika devas.\nThese are the lowest level of divinity. The name refers to the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Heavenly%20Kings\"&gt;Four Heavenly Kings&lt;/a&gt; (\"C\u0101turmah\u0101r\u0101ja\") who rule over this world along with the \"assemblage\" or \"multitude\" (\"k\u0101yika\") of beings that dwell there.\nThe Four Heavenly Kings are the leaders of various beings who reside here:\nThere are numerous otherworldly spirits and legendary creatures found in &lt;a href=\"Buddhist%20texts\"&gt;Buddhist texts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buddhist%20mythology\"&gt;Buddhist mythology&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these are shared with &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20mythology\"&gt;Hindu mythology&lt;/a&gt;. These include:\nYaksha.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"yaksha\"&gt;yaksha&lt;/a&gt;\" are a broad class of nature-spirits, usually benevolent, who are caretakers of the natural treasures hidden in the earth and tree roots. Having been worshiped in India since before the &lt;a href=\"Vedic%20period\"&gt;Vedic period&lt;/a&gt;, Hinduism adopted the worship of \"yaksha\" like &lt;a href=\"Kubera\"&gt;Kubera&lt;/a&gt;. Later their worship was adopted by Buddhism. In &lt;a href=\"Jainism\"&gt;Jainism&lt;/a&gt;, \"yakshas\" were worshiped as \"shasana devatas\" from the beginning.\nIn Buddhism, it is believed that they reside deep under the Himalayas where they guard the wealth of the Earth. The \"yaksha\" are ruled over by Kubera, the lord of wealth.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Burma\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt; there exists the popular worship of nature spirits called \"&lt;a href=\"Nat%20%28spirit%29\"&gt;nats&lt;/a&gt;\" which are worshiped alongside of Buddhism."
