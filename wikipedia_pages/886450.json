    "text": "Sir George Ayscue (c. 1616 \u2013 5 April 1672) was an English naval officer who served in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Dutch%20Wars\"&gt;Anglo-Dutch Wars&lt;/a&gt; who rose to the rank of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20of%20the%20white\"&gt;Admiral of the White&lt;/a&gt;. He also served as Governor of Scilly Isles (1647) and &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;Governor of Barbados&lt;/a&gt; (1650\u20131652).\nBiography.\nAyscue (sometimes, erroneously, Askew or Ayscough) came from an old &lt;a href=\"Lincolnshire\"&gt;Lincolnshire&lt;/a&gt; family, and was &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;ed by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles I&lt;/a&gt; on 9 August 1641. In 1646 he received a naval command, In August 1647 he was appointed Governor of &lt;a href=\"Scilly%20Isles\"&gt;Scilly Isles&lt;/a&gt; a post he held until January 1647. In July 1648, during the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, while serving as a captain in the navy of the English Parliament, he was recognized as restoring sailors' allegiances at sea and later in the year given command of two vessels and promoted to &lt;a href=\"Rear%20Admiral\"&gt;Rear Admiral&lt;/a&gt;. In 1649 he was appointed &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Squadron%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;Admiral of the Irish Seas&lt;/a&gt;. In 1650 Ayscue was appointed Governor of &lt;a href=\"Barbados\"&gt;Barbados&lt;/a&gt; and Commander of the squadron sent to the island. In 1651 he served with General at Sea &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Blake%20%28admiral%29\"&gt;Robert Blake&lt;/a&gt; in the capture of the &lt;a href=\"Isles%20of%20Scilly\"&gt;Scilly Isles&lt;/a&gt; from Sir &lt;a href=\"John%20Granville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Bath\"&gt;John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year he captured &lt;a href=\"Barbados\"&gt;Barbados&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Willoughby%2C%205th%20Baron%20Willoughby%20of%20Parham\"&gt;Lord Willoughby&lt;/a&gt; and the other English colonies in the Americas. In the &lt;a href=\"First%20Anglo-Dutch%20War\"&gt;First Anglo-Dutch War&lt;/a&gt; he was defeated by the Dutch Commodore &lt;a href=\"Michiel%20de%20Ruyter\"&gt;Michiel de Ruyter&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Plymouth\"&gt;Battle of Plymouth&lt;/a&gt;. Relieved of his command, he went into service in the Swedish Navy, returning after the &lt;a href=\"English%20Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles II&lt;/a&gt;. In 1664 he was appointed &lt;a href=\"Rear-Admiral%20of%20the%20Blue\"&gt;Rear-Admiral of the Blue Squadron&lt;/a&gt;. In June 1665 he was appointed &lt;a href=\"Vice-Admiral%20of%20the%20Blue\"&gt;Vice-Admiral of the Blue&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Anglo-Dutch%20War\"&gt;Second Anglo-Dutch War&lt;/a&gt; he commanded a squadron at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Lowestoft\"&gt;Battle of Lowestoft&lt;/a&gt; in 1665.\nIn February 1666 he was appointed &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20of%20the%20Blue\"&gt;Admiral of the Blue&lt;/a&gt; and at the start of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Days%27%20Battle\"&gt;Four Days' Battle&lt;/a&gt; in June 1666 he was elevated to the rank of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20of%20the%20white\"&gt;Admiral of the White&lt;/a&gt;, his flagship, , &lt;a href=\"Ship%20grounding\"&gt;ran aground&lt;/a&gt; on the Galloper Shoal and he was forced to surrender his ship to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant-Admiral\"&gt;Lieutenant-Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cornelis%20Tromp\"&gt;Cornelis Tromp&lt;/a&gt;, earning the unfortunate distinction of being the highest-ranking English naval officer to have been captured by the enemy. He was held prisoner during the war in the Dutch state prison of &lt;a href=\"Loevestein\"&gt;Loevestein&lt;/a&gt;, and almost certainly never again took to sea as admiral. In December 1671, he was the President of the Court Martial of Rear-Admiral Sir William Jennings, held on board . Sir George Ayscue was still a serving officer when he died at his &lt;a href=\"Westminster%2C%20London\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt; house on 5 April 1672. His burial was held on 13 April 1672 &lt;a href=\"St%20Margaret%27s%20Church%2C%20Westminster\"&gt;St Margaret's Church, Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, London, England."
