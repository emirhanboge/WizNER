    "text": " Frederik Christoffel Hendrik \"Frik\" du Preez (born 28 November 1935) is a former South African &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player who represented &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Bulls\"&gt;Northern Transvaal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Springboks&lt;/a&gt;. He was born on a farm near &lt;a href=\"Rustenburg\"&gt;Rustenburg&lt;/a&gt; and went to school at &lt;a href=\"Parys%20High%20School\"&gt;Parys High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Parys\"&gt;Parys&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Free%20State%20Province\"&gt;Orange Free State&lt;/a&gt;). Du Preez mostly played in the &lt;a href=\"Flanker%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;flank&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20positions%23Loose%20forward%20/%20Lock%20forward\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt; positions.\nDu Preez made his &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%23Major%20international%20competitions\"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; debut for the Springboks on 7 January 1961 in the flank position against &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Twickenham%20Stadium\"&gt;Twickenham&lt;/a&gt;. He played his last test on 7 August 1971 at the age of 35 as a lock against &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Sydney Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt;.\nDu Preez was an excellent all-round footballer, and like Australian lock &lt;a href=\"John%20Eales\"&gt;John Eales&lt;/a&gt;, he was that rare phenomenon: a &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20positions%23Loose%20forward%20/%20Lock%20forward\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt; that could kick and even drop kick. Although he was not particularly tall, he was a tower of strength in the line-out. In addition he had a fantastic turn of speed and fine running skills with ball in hand, as he showed in the try he scored against the &lt;a href=\"British%20and%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British Lions&lt;/a&gt; in 1968.\nAs an expression of the esteem that he is held in by South African rugby fans, Du Preez was named the country's rugby player of the 20th century."
