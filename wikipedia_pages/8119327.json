    "text": "Peter James Turner (born August 1974), better known as Pete Turner, is a British musician and songwriter who has been the &lt;a href=\"bassist\"&gt;bassist&lt;/a&gt; for the rock band &lt;a href=\"Elbow%20%28band%29\"&gt;Elbow&lt;/a&gt; since the group's formation.\nBiography.\nTurner grew up in &lt;a href=\"Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Bury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"adopted%20child\"&gt;adopted child&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; British parents. He has cited &lt;a href=\"Adam%20and%20the%20Ants\"&gt;Adam and the Ants&lt;/a&gt; as the first band which he \"really loved,\" and also cited &lt;a href=\"Duran%20Duran\"&gt;Duran Duran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Public%20Enemy\"&gt;Public Enemy&lt;/a&gt; as early favourites. Turner has credited Duran Duran's &lt;a href=\"John%20Taylor%20%28bass%20guitarist%29\"&gt;John Taylor&lt;/a&gt; as being his initial inspiration in becoming a bassist. He has also said that Public Enemy's record &lt;a href=\"Fear%20of%20a%20Black%20Planet\"&gt;Fear of a Black Planet&lt;/a&gt; is his favourite album.\nTurner was one of the three embryonic founders of what would later become Elbow, as he had formed a band named RPM with future Elbow members Richard Jupp and Mark Potter. Turner befriended future Elbow frontman &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Garvey\"&gt;Guy Garvey&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Bury%20College\"&gt;Bury College&lt;/a&gt; and the latter later joined RPM in 1991, triggering a band name change to Mr. Soft, and eventually later on first to just Soft and finally to Elbow in 1997.\nSometime in the &lt;a href=\"2000s\"&gt;2000s&lt;/a&gt;, Turner relocated from Bury to Manchester's city centre, and then moved again to the suburban area of &lt;a href=\"Chorlton-cum-Hardy\"&gt;Chorlton&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester's southern half in 2008."
