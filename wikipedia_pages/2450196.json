    "text": "IFK Eskilstuna is a &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"association%20Football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club located in &lt;a href=\"Eskilstuna\"&gt;Eskilstuna&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"S%C3%B6dermanland%20County\"&gt;S\u00f6dermanland County&lt;/a&gt;. In their early seasons IFK had a proud record as an &lt;a href=\"Allsvenskan\"&gt;Allsvenskan&lt;/a&gt; club but they now play in Division 2 V\u00e4stra Svealand, which is the fourth tier of Swedish football.\nBackground.\nIdrottsf\u00f6reningen Kamraterna Eskilstuna, which is the club's full name, were founded on 9 September 1897 and have a long rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Eskilstuna%20City%20FK\"&gt;Eskilstuna City FK&lt;/a&gt;. Historically IFK Eskilstuna have the stronger record having spent 14 seasons in the Allsvenskan but currently Eskilstuna City FK play in a higher division. In 1910, IFK participated in the first Svenska Serien along with &lt;a href=\"IFK%20G%C3%B6teborg\"&gt;IFK G\u00f6teborg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%96rgryte%20IS\"&gt;\u00d6rgryte IS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AIK%20Fotboll\"&gt;AIK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"IFK%20Norrk%C3%B6ping\"&gt;IFK Norrk\u00f6ping&lt;/a&gt;. Their first championship final match took place in 1921 when IFK defeated &lt;a href=\"IK%20Sleipner\"&gt;IK Sleipner&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 at the Stockholm Olympic Stadium before 11,695 spectators. They competed in another championship final match in 1923, this time going down 5\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"AIK%20Fotboll\"&gt;AIK&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early years, the club also played &lt;a href=\"bandy\"&gt;bandy&lt;/a&gt; and was playing in the then Swedish top-tier league Division 1 for two years in the 1930s.\nIFK competed in the very first Allsvenskan season in 1924/25 and played a further 13 seasons in the Allsvenskan from 1924/25-1928/29, 1930/31-1935/36, 1942/43, 1957/58 and 1964. Their best season was in 1931/32 when they finished in fifth place. The marathon table of Allsvenskan teams shows IFK in 23rd position, their last season at the highest level being in 1964.\nIFK reached the Allsvenskan qualifying stage in 1981 after winning Division 2 Norra in fine style by pipping &lt;a href=\"%C3%96rebro%20SK\"&gt;\u00d6rebro SK&lt;/a&gt; to the top position. However, IFK failed to win the play-offs against &lt;a href=\"Kalmar%20FF\"&gt;Kalmar FF&lt;/a&gt; to progress to the higher level. The 1987 season proved another near miss when IFK finished in second place to second place in Division I Norra to &lt;a href=\"Djurg%C3%A5rdens%20IF%20Fotboll\"&gt;Djurgarden&lt;/a&gt;. In 1988 history was repeated, this time IFK finishing second to &lt;a href=\"%C3%96rebro%20SK\"&gt;\u00d6rebro SK&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1992 IFK were relegated from Division 1 and subsequently have competed in the middle divisions of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Swedish football league system&lt;/a&gt;. The club currently plays in Division 3 V\u00e4stra Svealand which is the fifth tier of Swedish football. They play their home matches at the &lt;a href=\"Tunavallen\"&gt;Tunavallen&lt;/a&gt; in Eskilstuna.\nIFK Eskilstuna are affiliated to the &lt;a href=\"S%C3%B6dermanlands%20Fotbollf%C3%B6rbund\"&gt;S\u00f6dermanlands Fotbollf\u00f6rbund&lt;/a&gt;. The club have an active youth section. In 1970 and 1985 the junior team won the Swedish Junior Championship. Famous footballers who have played for IFK Eskilstuna include &lt;a href=\"Kennet%20Andersson\"&gt;Kenneth Andersson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20Larsson\"&gt;Sebastian Larsson&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttendances.\nIn recent seasons IFK Eskilstuna have had the following average attendances:\nThe attendance record at &lt;a href=\"Tunavallen\"&gt;Tunavallen&lt;/a&gt; was set in 1963 when 22,491 spectators attended the match with &lt;a href=\"GAIS\"&gt;GAIS&lt;/a&gt;."
