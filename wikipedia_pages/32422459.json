    "text": "Derek Arthur William Birnage (13 June 1913 \u2013 18 January 2004) was a British comics editor and writer and newspaper editor, best known as the founding editor of the weekly sports comic \"&lt;a href=\"Tiger%20%28Fleetway%29\"&gt;Tiger&lt;/a&gt;\" and as a writer of \"&lt;a href=\"Roy%20of%20the%20Rovers\"&gt;Roy of the Rovers&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Wandsworth\"&gt;Wandsworth&lt;/a&gt;, South &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, on 13 June 1913, the son of Frank Birnage, editor of the conservative evangelical newspaper the \"&lt;a href=\"Sunday%20Companion\"&gt;Sunday Companion&lt;/a&gt;\", and was educated at &lt;a href=\"Sutton%20Valence%20School\"&gt;Sutton Valence School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;. After leaving school he joined the comics department of &lt;a href=\"Amalgamated%20Press\"&gt;Amalgamated Press&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Reg%20Eves\"&gt;Reg Eves&lt;/a&gt;, initially working on \"&lt;a href=\"Schooldays%20%28comic%29\"&gt;Schooldays&lt;/a&gt;\". After it folded he moved to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Champion%20%28comics%29\"&gt;The Champion&lt;/a&gt;\" as a sub-editor under &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Smith%20%28comics%20editor%29\"&gt;Bernard Smith&lt;/a&gt;, also writing \"Colwyn Dane\", a detective strip, for the title.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; he did his military service in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Signal%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Signal Corps&lt;/a&gt;, before acting as editor of \"The Champion\" until Smith returned. He then left to write children's stories for rival publisher &lt;a href=\"Amex%20%28publisher%29\"&gt;Amex&lt;/a&gt;, but quit after only four months to run a toy shop in &lt;a href=\"Bexhill-on-Sea\"&gt;Bexhill&lt;/a&gt; with his wife, Audrey Waterman, whom he had married in 1946, and her parents. When Audrey's mother died a few years later, the shop was sold, and Birnage returned to Amalgamated Press. In 1952 he became editor of \"The Champion\" while Smith launched a new title, \"&lt;a href=\"Lion%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Lion&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1954 Birnage launched a new sports-themed comic, \"&lt;a href=\"Tiger%20%28comic%29\"&gt;Tiger&lt;/a&gt;\", and asked writer &lt;a href=\"Frank%20S.%20Pepper\"&gt;Frank S. Pepper&lt;/a&gt; to create a more realistic &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; strip than \"The Champion\"'s \"Danny of the Dazzlers\". The result was \"&lt;a href=\"Roy%20of%20the%20Rovers\"&gt;Roy of the Rovers&lt;/a&gt;\", drawn by &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Colquhoun\"&gt;Joe Colquhoun&lt;/a&gt;, who later also wrote the strip under the pseudonym Stewart Colwyn. After Colquhoun left in 1959, Birnage wrote the strip himself, using the pseudonym Frank Winsor, when not ghost-writing for the credited writer, &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Charlton\"&gt;Bobby Charlton&lt;/a&gt;.\nBirnage left \"Tiger\", and \"Roy of the Rovers\", in 1963, to edit comics annuals. He left comics in 1964 to edit his father's old paper, the \"&lt;a href=\"Sunday%20Companion\"&gt;Sunday Companion&lt;/a&gt;\", until it closed in 1970, before returning to &lt;a href=\"IPC%20Media\"&gt;IPC&lt;/a&gt; (as the publisher was now called after a series of mergers) to work for a new football comic, \"&lt;a href=\"Score%20%27n%27%20Roar\"&gt;Score 'n' Roar&lt;/a&gt;\", under &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Bicknell\"&gt;Sid Bicknell&lt;/a&gt;. He also edited \"&lt;a href=\"Smash%21%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Smash!&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Buster%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Buster&lt;/a&gt;\" before he was made redundant in 1972.\nAfter jobs in publishing, planning, and the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Social%20Security\"&gt;Department of Health and Social Security&lt;/a&gt;, Birnage retired to &lt;a href=\"Burgess%20Hill\"&gt;Burgess Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Sussex\"&gt;West Sussex&lt;/a&gt;, where he died on 18 January 2004, survived by his wife and their three children."
