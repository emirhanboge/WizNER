    "text": "Poopdeck Pappy is a &lt;a href=\"fictional%20character\"&gt;fictional character&lt;/a&gt; featured in the \"&lt;a href=\"Popeye%20%28comic%20strip%29\"&gt;Popeye&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Thimble%20Theatre\"&gt;Thimble Theatre&lt;/a&gt;\") &lt;a href=\"comic%20strip\"&gt;comic strip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"animated%20cartoon\"&gt;animated cartoon&lt;/a&gt; spinoffs. Created by &lt;a href=\"E.%20C.%20Segar\"&gt;E. C. Segar&lt;/a&gt; in 1936, the character is Popeye's father, who is between the ages of 85 and 99.\nHistory.\nPappy first appeared in \"Thimble Theatre\" not long after Popeye acquired &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20the%20Jeep\"&gt;Eugene the Jeep&lt;/a&gt; in 1936. Popeye decided to use the creature's &lt;a href=\"supernatural\"&gt;supernatural&lt;/a&gt; knowledge to find his father. An expedition which included Toar the caveman and &lt;a href=\"Olive%20Oyl\"&gt;Olive Oyl&lt;/a&gt; was set up to go to Barnacle Island. The ungrateful father answered Popeye's greeting with, \"You look like something the cat dragged in... I don't like relatives.\" He came to Popeye's home anyway, followed by some &lt;a href=\"mermaid\"&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt;s with whom he had flirted.\nPoopdeck Pappy made his first &lt;a href=\"animated\"&gt;animated&lt;/a&gt; appearance in the \"Popeye the Sailor\" short \"&lt;a href=\"Goonland\"&gt;Goonland&lt;/a&gt;\" (1938). In this cartoon, it is revealed that Popeye has a long-lost father, not seen since infancy, who is being held captive in the bizarre realm of &lt;a href=\"Goon%20Island\"&gt;Goon Island&lt;/a&gt;. When he goes to rescue the \"ol' goat\" in the Goon &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;, his father refuses to acknowledge Popeye as his son, but when Popeye is himself captured by the Goons, Pappy eats Popeye's mislaid can of &lt;a href=\"spinach\"&gt;spinach&lt;/a&gt; to rescue his only child. In the m\u00eal\u00e9e that ensues, the filmstrip is supposedly broken and the projectionist must safety pin it back together to finish the cartoon.\nPopeye is the spitting image of Poopdeck Pappy, though Pappy has a white &lt;a href=\"beard\"&gt;beard&lt;/a&gt;. Pappy is far less principled than his son, stealing from Popeye's &lt;a href=\"bank%20account\"&gt;bank account&lt;/a&gt; and trying to sell &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; for $5,000 in &lt;a href=\"Death%20Valley\"&gt;Death Valley&lt;/a&gt;. (To which, Popeye, while pouring water to the parched traveler, tells Poopdeck, \"I yam disgustipated wit' ya!\") There is no love lost between him and Olive Oyl, whom he calls a \"lath-legged bean pole.\" (This stemmed from Poopdeck slugging Olive when they first met). However, while he is grumpy and somewhat hostile, he is quite protective of Popeye, and does have a hidden soft side.\nAfter Segar's death, Poopdeck's mother (called Granny who looks like her son and grandson, but wearing a &lt;a href=\"bonnet%20%28headgear%29\"&gt;bonnet&lt;/a&gt;) was introduced into the strip. She refuses to treat her son as an \"eighty-five year-old adult\" (his age has been reduced from 99 to 85 in the comic strip) and often disciplines him after his raucous \"nights on the town.\" She tends to be more amiable to Popeye, although she too believes that Olive needs a bit more meat on her bones. However, Olive agrees with how Granny keeps Pappy in the house, because when she does, the town is able to get a sound sleep. Granny is also notorious as being one of the worst cooks in the world.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Fleischer%20Studios\"&gt;Fleischer Studios&lt;/a&gt; shorts, both Poopdeck Pappy and Popeye share the same voice, performed by &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Mercer\"&gt;Jack Mercer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearances.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Altman\"&gt;Robert Altman&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Popeye%20%281980%20film%29\"&gt;Popeye&lt;/a&gt;\", Poopdeck Pappy is played by &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Walston\"&gt;Ray Walston&lt;/a&gt;. He is the \"Commodore\" of Sweethaven, but gets kidnapped by Captain &lt;a href=\"Bluto\"&gt;Bluto&lt;/a&gt; and must be saved by Popeye. When Popeye sees his bulging arms, \"squinky\" eye and his &lt;a href=\"smoking%20pipe%20%28tobacco%29\"&gt;pipe&lt;/a&gt;, he recognizes his long-lost father\u2014though, as in their meeting on Goon Island, Pappy initially refuses to accept that Popeye is his son.\nHe also appears in &lt;a href=\"Popeye%20and%20Son\"&gt;Popeye and Son&lt;/a&gt;, in \"Poopdeck Pappy and the Family Tree.\" While he comes to help his grandson Junior with his school report, traces of the classic Pappy come shining through when describing their ancestors in greater unsavory detail (much to Junior's initial dismay).
