    "text": "Rye is a small, coastal, suburban &lt;a href=\"Administrative%20divisions%20of%20New%20York%23City\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Westchester County, New York&lt;/a&gt;, United States. It is separate from the &lt;a href=\"Rye%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Town of Rye&lt;/a&gt;, which has more land area than the city. The City of Rye, formerly the Village of Rye, was part of the Town until it received its &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20charter\"&gt;charter&lt;/a&gt; as a city in 1942, making it the youngest city in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York State&lt;/a&gt;. Some resources that track housing estimate that Rye's population is over 16,000. Its population density for its 5.85 square miles of land is roughly 2,729.76/sq mi.\nRye is notable for its waterfront which covers 60 percent of the city's six square miles and is governed by a waterfront act instituted in 1991. Located in the city are two &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt;s: the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Post%20Road%20Historic%20District%20%28Rye%2C%20New%20York%29\"&gt;Boston Post Road Historic District&lt;/a&gt; was designated a National Historic Landmark by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Park%20Service\"&gt;National Park Service&lt;/a&gt; in 1993; its centerpiece is the &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Estate\"&gt;Jay Estate&lt;/a&gt;, the childhood home of &lt;a href=\"John%20Jay\"&gt;John Jay&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Founding Father&lt;/a&gt; and the first &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Chief Justice&lt;/a&gt; of the United States.\n&lt;a href=\"Playland%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;Playland&lt;/a&gt;, a historic amusement park designated a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt; in 1987 is also located in Rye. Playland features one of the oldest wooden &lt;a href=\"roller%20coaster\"&gt;roller coaster&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Northeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;Northeast&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Coaster%20%28Playland%29\"&gt;Dragon Coaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nRye was once a part of &lt;a href=\"Fairfield%20County%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Fairfield County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Connecticut\"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, belonging to the Sachem Ponus, of the Ponus Wekuwuhm, Canaan Parish, and was probably named for that chieftain, \"Peningoe Neck\".\nIt was founded in 1660 by three men: Thomas Studwell, Peter Disbrow and John Coe. Later landowners included John Budd and family.\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries it was a haven for wealthy Manhattanites who travelled by coach or boat to escape the city heat. Its location on Long Island Sound and numerous beaches also appealed to visitors with more moderate means who gravitated for short stays at cottages and waterfront hotels.\nIt has an extraordinary inventory of buildings with architectural distinction that help visually articulate specific neighborhoods and districts.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nRye is \"situated in the eastern part of central Westchester County on Long Island Sound. The western border of the City generally parallels Beaver Swamp Brook, while the eastern border is formed by Milton Harbor and the Sound. Blind Brook traverses the City from the northwest corner of Rye to Milton Harbor at the southern end.\"\nRock and wetlands.\nThe geology and hydrology of Rye is characterized by a significant quantity of rock, marshes and wetlands which makes the city both desirably scenic but also challenging for developers.\nRye's bedrock is predominantly constituted of Fordham gneiss and Harrison diorite also known as Byram Black granite.\nAccording to Rye's 1985 Master Plan, \"Rye contains a variety of environmentally significant areas. Numerous tidal and freshwater wetlands are found near the waterfront and brooks. The Milton Harbor area (including the Marshlands Conservancy and Rye Golf Club), Disbrow Park and the Manursing area contain the most extensive wetlands in the City. In addition, substantial areas near the Sound, Milton Harbor, Blind Brook and Beaver Swamp Brook are within the 100 year flood hazard area, and thus subject to potential flooding.\" According to the City of Rye, \"Considerable acreage of these important natural resources has been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, polluting and other acts inconsistent with the natural uses of such areas. Remaining wetlands are in jeopardy of being lost, despoiled or impaired by such acts contrary to the public safety and welfare.\" As a result,\nthe City has charged itself with the responsibility of \"preventing the despoilation and destruction of wetlands and watercourses while taking into account varying ecological, economic, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands or watercourses should be located on upland sites in such a manner as not to degrade these systems.\"\nIn 2017, Rye resident and then New York State Senator &lt;a href=\"George%20Latimer%20%28New%20York%20politician%29\"&gt;George Latimer&lt;/a&gt; noted that wetlands maps for the area have not been updated in over 20 years \nFlooding.\nFlooding has long been an issue in Rye as in other coastal towns with water coming in from Long Island Sound. The &lt;a href=\"Blind%20Brook%20watershed\"&gt;Blind Brook watershed&lt;/a&gt; is also a source of that flooding.\nThree major weather events in just five years produced catastrophic damage in the town.\nThe City's response to these recurring hazards was to apply for funding through the NY Rising Community Reconstruction Program.c Rye received $3,000,000 to safeguard the city against future flooding threats, upgrade its infrastructure for resiliency, identify stormwater mitigation solutions, and protect historic buildings and natural wetlands.\nSeptember 1\u20132, 2021, Rye, NY had sustained another substantial flooding event. Areas around Indian Village and other areas flooded during Hurricane Irene were under 8\u20139 feet of water. Other areas around the town normally not affected by flooding were affected. Prior to the flooding event, Rye had undergone approximately five inches of rainfall fall from &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Henri\"&gt;Hurricane Henri&lt;/a&gt;. Two weeks later, the remnants &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Ida\"&gt;Hurricane Ida&lt;/a&gt; dropped another 8\u20139 inches of rain in the area within a 12 hour period. \nHurricane Ida remnants caused flooding in Rye nearly 10 years to the day from Hurricane Irene.\nArchaeological significance and notable indigenous sites.\nAs of 2010, seventy-five percent of the acreage in Rye or the equivalent of 3,954 acres had been determined to be archaeologically sensitive with many Native American contact sites. At least two villages have been determined to have existed, one on Manursing Island and the other on today's Milton Point. \nThe presence of indigenous people's activities has been noted in numerous locations where implements and bones were unearthed, including an \"ancient Indian burial ground, site of the present Playland Casino\" together with discoveries of artifacts along the shoreline, pottery, skeletons and relics along Milton Road, Disbrow Park and throughout today's Boston Post Road Historic District including Marshlands Conservancy.\nThe presence of indigenous people in Rye was more recently documented in a 2012 Phase IA archaeological investigation commissioned by Westchester County in connection with the construction of a bike path along the Playland Parkway in Rye. Within just one mile of the project site, the report noted a dozen archeologically sensitive areas. The publication included supporting data from files in the repositories of NYOPRHP and the NY State Museum; it further highlighted the existence of shell middens, evidence of camp sites and at least two burial grounds. One of these documented sites included the Blind Brook. Additional findings have been made at the Jay Estate in archaeological digs conducted by Dr. Euegene Boesch and submitted to the NY State Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS).\nPlanning and zoning.\nThe City's Master Plan was last updated in 1985 with an expectation that it would be updated again in 2000. Failure to update the Master Plan has produced concerns from residents about unrestricted development, flooding, higher than expected volume of teardowns and numerous other negative impacts on community life. Previous Master plans were created in 1929, 1945 and 1963.\nDemographics.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 United States Census&lt;/a&gt;, there were 15,720 people living in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 88.2% White, 1.3% Black, 0.8% Native American, 5.6% Asian, and 2.7% from two or more races. 6.7% were Hispanic or Latino of any race. Estimates for 2018 were 15,752.\nEconomy.\nAccording to a 2018 \"USA Today\" article, Rye is ranked 30th among America's wealthiest towns based on the following data: the median household income was $162,394; the median house value was $1,107,000. 73.2% of Rye residents had a college degree.\nRye is home to:\nArts and culture.\nHistoric sites.\nOf the more than 2600 National Historic Landmark (NHL) sites in the country, Rye has two: the Boston Post Road Historic District and Playland Amusement Park \n&lt;a href=\"Boston%20Post%20Road%20Historic%20District%20%28Rye%2C%20New%20York%29\"&gt;Boston Post Road Historic District (Rye, New York)&lt;/a&gt; (NRHP listing 1982) (NPS designation 1994).\nIncludes 5 historically significant parcels; much of the land was originally the ancestral home of American Founding Father &lt;a href=\"John%20Jay\"&gt;John Jay&lt;/a&gt;. It is where he grew up and where he is buried.\n&lt;a href=\"Playland%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;Rye Playland&lt;/a&gt; (NRHP listing 1980)(NPS designation 1987).\nThis 279-acre theme park is owned and operated by Westchester County and includes rides, games, an indoor skating rink or Ice Casino, beach, a boardwalk, and concession stands. It is one of only two amusement parks in the country with National Historic Landmark status, the other one being &lt;a href=\"Kennywood\"&gt;Kennywood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. It has been a popular destination since it first opened in 1928. Its wooden roller coaster, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Coaster%20%28Playland%29\"&gt;Dragon Coaster&lt;/a&gt;, built in 1929, is one of the last roller coaster rides built by engineer &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Church%20%28engineer%29\"&gt;Frederick Church&lt;/a&gt; that is still operating. The &lt;a href=\"Derby%20Racer\"&gt;Derby Racer&lt;/a&gt;, also built by Church, is one of only three rides of its kind remaining in the world. &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Close\"&gt;Glenn Close&lt;/a&gt;'s and Ellen Latzen's characters ride the roller coaster in the 1980s thriller film, \"&lt;a href=\"Fatal%20Attraction\"&gt;Fatal Attraction&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Airplane%20Coaster\"&gt;Airplane Coaster&lt;/a&gt;, Church's most acclaimed coaster, was removed in 1957. Playland is also the setting for several key scenes in the 1988 comedy film \"&lt;a href=\"Big%20%28film%29\"&gt;Big&lt;/a&gt;\", starring &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Hanks\"&gt;Tom Hanks&lt;/a&gt;\nSites on the National Register of Historic Places.\nOf the more than 88,000 sites in the country that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), Rye has 8.\nAdditional historic resources.\nOf note are two 200 plus year old milestones labeled 24 and 25 on the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Post%20Road\"&gt;Boston Post Road&lt;/a&gt;, oldest thoroughfare in the United States. The concept of mile markers to measure the distance from New York City was originated in 1763 by &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Franklin\"&gt;Benjamin Franklin&lt;/a&gt; during his term as &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Postmaster%20General\"&gt;Postmaster General&lt;/a&gt;. These sandstone markers likely date from 1802 when the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%201%20in%20New%20York\"&gt;Westchester Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; was configured.\nRye is also home to a rare 1938 &lt;a href=\"Works%20Progress%20Administration\"&gt;WPA&lt;/a&gt; mural by realist &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Pene%20du%20Bois\"&gt;Guy Pene du Bois&lt;/a&gt; which is located within the city's Post Office lobby and titled \"John Jay at His Home.\"\nRye is home to two of the 14 sites on the &lt;a href=\"African%20American%20Heritage%20Trail%20of%20Westchester%20County\"&gt;African American Heritage Trail of Westchester County&lt;/a&gt;- The Rye African-American Cemetery and the Jay Estate.\nParks and recreation.\nParks and nature reserves.\nRye has over 454 acres of green open space with multiple types of usage from active to passive recreation including walking, hiking, bird-watching and dog walking. It is also a significant coastal community. In 1991, the City of Rye authored a Local Waterfront Revitalization Program (LWRP) to provide clear guidance for addressing future water conservation and preservation issues \nPrivate and public clubs.\nRye has numerous private country clubs, many of which were formed in the late 19th and early 20th century. The combined acreage of these clubs affords members and guests over 993 acres of recreation.\nRecreation facilities.\nAccess to recreation in Rye is plentiful with numerous public, private and shared sports facilities from tennis, to ice hockey to boating.\nEducation.\nPublic schools.\nRye is served by three public elementary schools: Osborn, Milton, and Midland.\nRye Middle School and &lt;a href=\"Rye%20High%20School%20%28Rye%2C%20New%20York%29\"&gt;Rye High School&lt;/a&gt; are part of the same campus, and the two buildings connect.\nThe Greenhaven and The Preserve at Rye neighborhoods of the City of Rye are served by the &lt;a href=\"Rye%20Neck%20Union%20Free%20School%20District\"&gt;Rye Neck School District&lt;/a&gt;.
