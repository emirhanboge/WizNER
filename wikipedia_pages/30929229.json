    "text": "Dynamic is an Italian &lt;a href=\"independent%20record%20label\"&gt;independent record label&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Genoa\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 1978, it specialises in &lt;a href=\"classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;, especially rarely performed works and has produced several world premiere recordings. The Dynamic catalogue contains over 400 titles, with about 25 new titles added each year and is distributed in 32 countries.\nHistory.\nDynamic was founded in 1978 by Pietro Mosetti Casaretto and his wife Marisa. Mosetti Casaretto, a surgeon and amateur violinist, took over a small label founded by the &lt;a href=\"musicologist\"&gt;musicologist&lt;/a&gt; Edward Neill. In the beginning, Dynamic was a small family business. Mosetti Casaretto and his wife recorded in local churches, oratories and villas. The first recordings were issued on vinyl, the very first one being &lt;a href=\"Paganini\"&gt;Paganini&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Barucab\u00e0 Variations\" played by &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Accardo\"&gt;Salvatore Accardo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1985 the company moved to its current site in the Villa Quartana on the &lt;a href=\"Righi%2C%20Genoa\"&gt;Righi hill&lt;/a&gt; overlooking &lt;a href=\"Genoa\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt;, where it set up a recording hall that could house a small &lt;a href=\"chamber%20orchestra\"&gt;chamber orchestra&lt;/a&gt;. In the late 1990s Mosetti Casaretto retired, and management of the label was taken over by his son-in-law, Alberto Dellepiane. Over the years, the label's focus on chamber music and particularly violin music has widened to include full-length opera recordings on both CD and DVD. More recently, Dynamic has become a &lt;a href=\"High-definition%20television\"&gt;high definition&lt;/a&gt; content producer for television and cinema. &lt;a href=\"Naxos%20%28company%29\"&gt;Naxos&lt;/a&gt; acquired Dynamic in 2014.\nNotable recordings.\nDynamic has recorded on DVD several live opera performances at &lt;a href=\"La%20Fenice\"&gt;La Fenice&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20crociato%20in%20Egitto\"&gt;Il crociato in Egitto&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20roi%20de%20Lahore\"&gt;Le roi de Lahore&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Maometto%20secondo\"&gt;Maometto secondo&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Tha%C3%AFs%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Tha\u00efs&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Pia%20de%27%20Tolomei%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Pia de' Tolomei&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Didone%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Didone&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20in%20Venice%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Death in Venice&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20p%C3%AAcheurs%20de%20perles\"&gt;Les p\u00eacheurs de perles&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Baldassare%20Galuppi\"&gt;Baldassare Galuppi&lt;/a&gt;'s rarely performed \"L'Olimpiade\".
