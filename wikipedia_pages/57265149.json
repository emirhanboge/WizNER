    "text": "Zerzevan Castle ( ), also known as Samachi Castle, is a ruined Eastern Roman castle, a former important military base, in &lt;a href=\"Diyarbak%C4%B1r%20Province\"&gt;Diyarbak\u0131r Province&lt;/a&gt;, southeastern Turkey. Archaeological excavations at the site revealed the existence of underground structures, among them a temple of &lt;a href=\"Mithraism\"&gt;Mithraism&lt;/a&gt;, a mystery religion. The castle was used as a civilian settlement between the 1890s and the 1960s. The site is partly open to tourism.According \nEtymology.\nSome travellers mention the name of this place as \"Kasr Zerzaua\" in 18th century while Evliya Celebi, an Ottoman traveller who lived in 17th century mentions in his &lt;a href=\"Seyahatname\"&gt;Seyahatname&lt;/a&gt; (volume IV) about this place as \"Zerzivan Valley\" while travelling from &lt;a href=\"Diyarbakir\"&gt;Diyarbakir&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mardin\"&gt;Mardin&lt;/a&gt;. The name of Zerzevan derives from Kurdish word of \"z\u00ear\" (gold) and it \"is the changed form of Zerzaua mentioned by the travellers and it is the name given to the settlement while the village\" was located in the same place.\nLocation.\nZerzevan Castle was built in the 4th century by the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Eastern Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; as a military base on the ancient trade route between &lt;a href=\"Diyarbak%C4%B1r\"&gt;Diyarbak\u0131r&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mardin\"&gt;Mardin&lt;/a&gt;. It was in use until the 7th century. The castle is situated on the top of a -high rocky hill next to Demir\u00f6l\u00e7ek village about southeast of &lt;a href=\"%C3%87%C4%B1nar%2C%20Diyarbak%C4%B1r\"&gt;\u00c7\u0131nar&lt;/a&gt; town in &lt;a href=\"Diyarbak%C4%B1r%20Province\"&gt;Diyarbak\u0131r Province&lt;/a&gt; on the highway to Mardin. It is located about from Diyarbak\u0131r.\nArchaeological works.\nThe first archaeological excavations took place in the summer months of 2014. The works were initially carried out by a team of 35 led by an archaeologist from &lt;a href=\"Dicle%20University\"&gt;Dicle University&lt;/a&gt;, under the supervision of the &lt;a href=\"Diyarbak%C4%B1r%20Archaeological%20Museum\"&gt;Diyarbak\u0131r Archaeological Museum&lt;/a&gt;. In 2015, the size of the team working at the site increased to 60. It is expected that excavation works will continue for around 30 more years.\nIn 2020, archaeologists found the entrance of the castle.\nIn 2021, archaeologists discovered a flute with six holes and a bronze ring with a key which was used to open a chest. Both items dated back to the 4th and 5th centuries AD.\nCastle.\nThe castle stretches over an area of . The castle contains structures both above and below ground. Its ruined walls are long and high, and it has a -high &lt;a href=\"watchtower\"&gt;watchtower&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the castle, there are ruins in a wide area and a rock-&lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. In the north of the castle, which is at a lower elevation, residences and streets were erected while in the south public buildings were constructed on the higher terrain. A church building facing east-west remains one of the most well-conserved public buildings. Other public buildings include the palace, administrative building, baths, cereal storage, &lt;a href=\"arsenal\"&gt;arsenal&lt;/a&gt;, and 54 &lt;a href=\"cistern\"&gt;cistern&lt;/a&gt;s. Military and medical material, jewelry, ornaments, and bronze coins were also found during the excavations. In 2016, a subterranean church and secret passageways were discovered. The discovered underground secret passageway was not in use for about 3,000 years and the subterranean church was closed around 1,500 years ago. A &lt;a href=\"Mithraism\"&gt;Mithraic&lt;/a&gt; underground temple and a subterranean sanctuary, able to hold 400 people, were also unearthed. The underground temple remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Greco-Roman%20mysteries\"&gt;mystery religion&lt;/a&gt; attracted more than 20,000 tourists in just one week according to reports by officials. In 2017, four more underground locations were discovered, where further excavation works are necessary to unearth them.\nThe castle was an Eastern Roman military base and a strategic &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; settlement, dominating the entire valley and controlling the ancient road between &lt;a href=\"Amida%20%28Mesopotamia%29\"&gt;Amida&lt;/a&gt; (now Diyarbak\u0131r) and &lt;a href=\"Dara%20%28Mesopotamia%29\"&gt;Dara&lt;/a&gt; (now Mardin). The castle played a key role due to its location on the easternmost border protecting the Roman Empire. It marked the intersection and coalescence of the cultures in the west and the east.\nThe place was known as Samachi in &lt;a href=\"classical%20antiquity\"&gt;classical antiquity&lt;/a&gt;. It was the site of &lt;a href=\"Roman%E2%80%93Persian%20Wars\"&gt;heavy fighting&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Sasanian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Jewelry found in the castle also indicates that the civilian population and military personnel resided together, with soldiers living alongside their family members. It was large enough to sustain a population of around one thousand.\nRestoration and reconstruction works, which took place during the reigns of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Byzantine%20emperors\"&gt;Eastern Roman emperors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anastasius%20I%20Dicorus\"&gt;Anastasius I Dicorus&lt;/a&gt; (r. 491\u2013518) and &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20I\"&gt;Justinian I&lt;/a&gt; (r. 527\u2013565), saw the castle develop into its final state prior to its ruin. The castle was most likely in use until 639 with the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Muslims\"&gt;Arab Muslims&lt;/a&gt; in the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine%20wars\"&gt;Arab\u2013Byzantine wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse as civilian settlement.\nA new settlement was created within the castle once again in the 1890s, when a family moved into the castle. As the population grew to over 30 households, the residents ultimately abandoned the castle in the 1960s, descended to a place about from the castle, and founded a village under the name Zerzevan. This village is called Demir\u00f6l\u00e7ek today."
