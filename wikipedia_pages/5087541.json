    "text": "Kambalda is a small mining town about from the mining city of &lt;a href=\"Kalgoorlie\"&gt;Kalgoorlie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, within the &lt;a href=\"Goldfields-Esperance\"&gt;Goldfields&lt;/a&gt;. It is split into two townsites apart, Kambalda East and Kambalda West; and is located on the western edge of a giant &lt;a href=\"salt%20lake\"&gt;salt lake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Lefroy\"&gt;Lake Lefroy&lt;/a&gt;. According the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Australian%20census\"&gt;2016 census&lt;/a&gt;, Kambalda had a population of 2,539.\nKambalda was discovered from a huge mining boom which triggered &lt;a href=\"prospectors\"&gt;prospectors&lt;/a&gt; from all over Western Australia to come flowing into Kambalda. Kambalda's first modern &lt;a href=\"Human%20settlement\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; was located at the base of nearby Red Hill in 1897. The original Red Hill settlement owed its existence to Percy Larkin, a prospector who discovered gold in the area. For many years Kambalda was mined for its &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; but soon after &lt;a href=\"nickel\"&gt;nickel&lt;/a&gt; was discovered.\nHistory.\nKambalda is a small mining town, in a semi-arid environment, approximately southeast of &lt;a href=\"Coolgardie\"&gt;Coolgardie&lt;/a&gt; and east of &lt;a href=\"Perth\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;. Kambalda was also known to be within the tribal land of the indigenous Galaagu people. Kambalda's determination to keep as much native &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; as possible separates them from other similar mining towns. Kambalda West is approximately from Kambalda East and is the location of the tourist bureau and the shire offices.\nThe original settlement of Kambalda grew up in the area after Percy Larkin discovered &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; in December 1896. The town was officially gazetted on 10 December 1897 and laid out by the Government surveyor, W. Rowley, who chose the name 'Kambalda' The Red Hill Gold Mine, which began operations in 1897, was relatively short-lived. It was closed by 1907 and the small settlement had become a &lt;a href=\"ghost%20town\"&gt;ghost town&lt;/a&gt;. One memory of the original town is the old well in George Cowcill Street.\nNew interest in the area occurred in 1954 when George Cowcill took samples of what he thought was &lt;a href=\"uranium\"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;. Later analysis found large deposits of &lt;a href=\"nickel\"&gt;nickel&lt;/a&gt; and by 1966 &lt;a href=\"Western%20Mining%20Corporation\"&gt;Western Mining Corporation&lt;/a&gt; had established Australia's first nickel mine. It is fair to describe Kambalda East and Kambalda West as Australia's first nickel mining towns. Apart from the Red Hill Lookout with its views over Lake Lefroy, and the opportunity to drive across the causeway, the town offers historical attractions and modern amenities, with a 24-hour RV stop area, shops and a skate park. Kambalda is known for its feral goats.\nPresent day.\nThe first mining company that established the town was the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Mining%20Corporation\"&gt;Western Mining Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (WMC), which in 2005 was taken over by &lt;a href=\"BHP%20Billiton\"&gt;BHP Billiton&lt;/a&gt;. Other mining companies in the area include &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Fields\"&gt;Gold Fields&lt;/a&gt;, Lightning Nickel, and GHB.\nThe town population has more recently been receding, thought to be due to increasing fly-in fly-out operations by mining companies.\nAttractions.\nKambalda's best attraction is the Red Hill Lookout, which is accessed by following Gordon Adams Road. Red Hill has a bushwalking trail (Red Hill Walking Trail), and from the top travellers have a bird's eye view of nearby Lake Lefroy, a large salt pan which stretches to the horizon and is rarely filled with water. The Lake is often used for land-sailing.\nKambalda's Memorial Garden and Miners Memorial Wall are situated behind the Shire office in Kambalda West. The Garden has a shady gazebo surrounded by native plants and scented roses. The Memorial Wall was built to honour those who had lost their lives while working in Kambalda's mines.\nAlso located within the Kambalda area are the remains of King Battery. Located on Woolibah station, the King Battery was employed to process gold-bearing ores from local gold mines. Today all that remains of the original operation is a tower and some brickwork which housed a tailings wheel which is often mistaken for a water paddle wheel. The King Battery area also provides a venue for bushwalking and picnic activities. \nEach year, Kambalda hosts these and many other events:\nServices.\nThe town is serviced with a supermarket, post office, newsagency, public library, hotel, recreation centre, a petrol station and two schools. The local bank, operated by &lt;a href=\"Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Banking%20Group%20Limited\"&gt;ANZ&lt;/a&gt;, closed in September 2018.\nFlights to and from Kambalda via Perth are operated by &lt;a href=\"Cobham%20Aviation%20Services%20Australia\"&gt;Cobham&lt;/a&gt;. (The airport closed commercial flights in October 2015.)\nThe Kambalda Health Centre is open six days a week and is staffed by nursing staff; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.stjohnhealth.com.au/contact-us/kambalda/\"&gt;St John Health&lt;/a&gt; has rolled out its first regional medical practice, with a Doctor available Monday to Saturday, including until 9 pm Thursday evenings. The Health Centre has emergency resuscitation facilities as well as pathology services.\nThere are also a number of defibrillators located around both town sites."
