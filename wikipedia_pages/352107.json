    "text": "Ushuaia ( , ) is the &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20del%20Fuego%20Province%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;Tierra del Fuego, Ant\u00e1rtida e Islas del Atl\u00e1ntico Sur Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, and the southernmost city of the country. Ushuaia claims the title of &lt;a href=\"the%20southernmost%20city%20in%20the%20world\"&gt;world's southernmost city&lt;/a&gt;. Ushuaia is located in a wide &lt;a href=\"bay\"&gt;bay&lt;/a&gt; on the southern coast of &lt;a href=\"Isla%20Grande%20de%20Tierra%20del%20Fuego\"&gt;Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego&lt;/a&gt;, bounded on the north by the &lt;a href=\"Martial%20Mountains\"&gt;Martial mountain&lt;/a&gt; range and on the south by the &lt;a href=\"Beagle%20Channel\"&gt;Beagle Channel&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only &lt;a href=\"municipality\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; in the Department of Ushuaia, which has an area of . It was founded on October 12, 1884, by &lt;a href=\"Augusto%20Lasserre\"&gt;Augusto Lasserre&lt;/a&gt; and is located on the shores of the Beagle Channel surrounded by the mountain range of the Martial Glacier, in the Bay of Ushuaia. Besides being an administrative center, it is a light industrial port and tourist hub. Ushuaia is located roughly from the coast of &lt;a href=\"Antarctica\"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;.\nToponymy.\nThe word \"Ushuaia\" comes from the &lt;a href=\"Yaghan%20language\"&gt;Yaghan language&lt;/a&gt;: \"ush\" and \"waia\" (\"bay\" or \"cove\") and means \"deep bay\" or \"bay to background\". The act creating the subprefecture in 1884 cites the name \"Oshovia\", one of the many orthographic variations of the word. Its &lt;a href=\"demonym\"&gt;demonym&lt;/a&gt; is \"Ushuaiense\".\nThe name is often pronounced \"u-sua-ia\" (), an exception to the orthographic rules of Spanish, since the 's' forms a syllable with the following 'u' despite the intervening 'h'. The pronunciation \"Usua\u00eda\" (accented on the 'i') is erroneous: the prosodic accent is on the first 'a', which is why the word is written without an accent mark.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Selknam%20people\"&gt;Selk\u2019nam Indians&lt;/a&gt;, also called the Ona, first arrived in &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20del%20Fuego\"&gt;Tierra del Fuego&lt;/a&gt; about 10,000 years ago. The southern group of people indigenous to the area, the &lt;a href=\"Yaghan%20people\"&gt;Yaghan&lt;/a&gt; (also known as Y\u00e1mana), who occupied what is now Ushuaia, lived in continual conflict with the northern inhabitants of the island.\nFor much of the latter half of the 19th century, the eastern portion of Tierra del Fuego was populated by a substantial majority of nationals who were not Argentine citizens, including a number of British subjects. Ushuaia was founded informally by British missionaries, following previous British surveys, long before Argentine nationals or government representatives arrived there on a permanent basis. The British ship &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Beagle\"&gt;HMS \"Beagle\"&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Robert%20FitzRoy\"&gt;Robert FitzRoy&lt;/a&gt;, first reached the channel on January 29, 1833, during its maiden voyage surveying &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20del%20Fuego\"&gt;Tierra del Fuego&lt;/a&gt;. The city was originally named by early &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; missionaries using the native &lt;a href=\"Yaghan%20language\"&gt;Y\u00e1mana&lt;/a&gt; name for the area. Much of the early history of the city and its &lt;a href=\"hinterland\"&gt;hinterland&lt;/a&gt; is described in &lt;a href=\"Lucas%20Bridges\"&gt;Lucas Bridges&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s book \"Uttermost Part of the Earth\" (1948). The name \"Ushuaia\" first appears in letters and reports of the &lt;a href=\"South%20American%20Mission%20Society\"&gt;South American Mission Society&lt;/a&gt; in England. The British missionary &lt;a href=\"Waite%20Hockin%20Stirling\"&gt;Waite Hockin Stirling&lt;/a&gt; became the first European to live in Ushuaia when he stayed with the Y\u00e1mana people between 18 January and mid-September 1869. In 1870 more British missionaries arrived to establish a small settlement. The following year the first marriage was performed. During 1872, 36 baptisms and 7 marriages and the first European birth (Thomas Despard Bridges) in Tierra del Fuego were registered. The first house constructed in Ushuaia was a pre-assembled 3 room home prepared in the &lt;a href=\"Falkland%20Islands\"&gt;Falkland Islands&lt;/a&gt; in 1870 for Reverend &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Bridges%20%28Anglican%20missionary%29\"&gt;Thomas Bridges&lt;/a&gt;. One room was for the Bridges family, a second was for a Y\u00e1mana married couple, while the third served as the chapel.\nThomas Bridges learned the Yaghan (coastal dwellers) language and was a fluent speaker. To a lesser extent he was able to communicate in the Ona (forest dwellers) language. His missionary work was mainly directed at the Yaghans. The word Yamana simply means \"people\" in the Yaghan language. He wrote a dictionary of the Yaghan language, the original manuscript of which is in the British Museum. As the Yaghans had no ability nor means to write, Thomas Bridges had to construct an alphabet which was suited to the phonetics of the language. The original manuscript was lost three times but recovered and almost published under an incorrect name. More than one alphabet has been used over the years in the rendering of this dictionary. The odyssey of the manuscript covered nearly half a century before it was finally published. Natalie Goodall was instrumental in reprinting the dictionary in 1987 and providing valuable insights into the history of Thomas Bridges' work. Copies of the dictionary provide material on the letters and pronunciations used which in many respects differ from the alphabet used in the English language. (Ref: A de la Rue).\nDuring 1873, Juan and Clara Lawrence, the first Argentine citizens to visit Ushuaia, arrived to teach school. That same year &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Argentino%20Roca\"&gt;Julio Argentino Roca&lt;/a&gt;, who later served as Argentine President twice, promoted the establishment of a &lt;a href=\"penal%20colony\"&gt;penal colony&lt;/a&gt; for re-offenders, modeled after one in &lt;a href=\"Tasmania\"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, in an effort to secure permanent residents from &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and to help establish Argentine &lt;a href=\"sovereignty\"&gt;sovereignty&lt;/a&gt; over all of Tierra del Fuego. But only after the &lt;a href=\"Boundary%20treaty%20of%201881%20between%20Chile%20and%20Argentina\"&gt;Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina&lt;/a&gt; did formal efforts get under way to establish the township and its prison.\nDuring the 1880s, many gold prospectors came to Ushuaia following rumors of large gold fields, which proved to be false. On 12 October 1884, as part of the South Atlantic Expedition, &lt;a href=\"Commodore%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Commodore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Augusto%20Lasserre\"&gt;Augusto Lasserre&lt;/a&gt; established the sub-division of Ushuaia, with the missionaries and naval officers signing the Act of Ceremony. Don Feliz M Paz was named Governor of Tierra del Fuego and in 1885 named Ushuaia as its capital. In 1885 the territory police was organized under Antonio A. Romero with headquarters also in Ushuaia. But it was not until 1904 that the Federal Government of &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; recognized Ushuaia as the capital of Tierra del Fuego.\nUshuaia suffered several epidemics, including &lt;a href=\"typhus\"&gt;typhus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pertussis\"&gt;pertussis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"measles\"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;, that much reduced the native population. But because the Y\u00e1mana were not included in census data, the exact numbers lost are not known. The first census was held in 1893, which recorded 113 men and 36 women living in Ushuaia. The prison was formally announced in an &lt;a href=\"Executive%20%28government%29\"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; by the then-Acting President Roca in 1896. By 1911 the Y\u00e1mana had all practically disappeared, so the mission was closed. The population grew to 1,558 by the 1914 census.\nIn 1896 the prison received its first inmates, mainly re-offenders and dangerous prisoners transferred from &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, but also some political prisoners. A separate military prison opened in 1903 at the nearby &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Golondrina\"&gt;Puerto Golondrina&lt;/a&gt;. The two prisons merged in 1910, and that combined complex still stands today. Thus, during the first half of the 20th century, the city centered around the prison built by the Argentine government to increase the Argentine population and to ensure Argentine sovereignty over Tierra del Fuego. The prison was intended for repeat offenders and serious criminals, following the example of the British in &lt;a href=\"Tasmania\"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; and the French in &lt;a href=\"Devil%27s%20Island\"&gt;Devil's Island&lt;/a&gt;. Escape from Tierra del Fuego was similarly difficult, although two prisoners managed to escape into the surrounding area for a few weeks. The prison population thus became forced colonists and spent much of their time building the town with timber from the forest around the prison. They also built a railway to the settlement, now a tourist attraction known as the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Fuegian%20Railway\"&gt;End of the World Train&lt;/a&gt; (\"Tren del Fin del Mundo\"), the southernmost railway in the world.\nThe prison operated until 1947, when President &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Per%C3%B3n\"&gt;Juan Per\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; closed it by executive order in response to the many reports of abuse and unsafe practices. Most of the guards stayed in Ushuaia, while the prisoners were relocated to other jails farther north. After the prison closed, it became a part of the , functioning as a storage and office facility until the early 1990s. Later it was converted into the current Museo Maritimo de Ushuaia.\nThe naval base at Ushuaia was active during the &lt;a href=\"Falklands%20War\"&gt;Falklands War&lt;/a&gt; of 1982. The Argentine cruiser &lt;a href=\"ARA%20General%20Belgrano\"&gt;ARA \"General Belgrano\"&lt;/a&gt;, subsequently sunk by the British Fleet, sailed from the Port of Ushuaia, where a memorial was erected in February 1996.\nPhysical geography.\nLocation.\nUshuaia is located on Ushuaia Bay at 6 meters above sea level, surrounded to the west, north, and east by the &lt;a href=\"Andes%20Fueguinos\"&gt;Andes Fueguinos&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only city accessed from the rest of the country by crossing part of the Andes mountain range that runs along the southern edge of &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20del%20Fuego\"&gt;Tierra del Fuego&lt;/a&gt;. National Route 3 crosses the Sierra Alvear through the Garibaldi Pass to enter the Carabajal Valley, where it follows the Olivia River through the Sierra Sorondo to the Beagle Channel and Ushuaia Bay. For this reason, in Argentina it is considered the only trans-Andean city (\"ciudad trasandina\").\nUshuaia has long been described as the southernmost &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in the world. While there are settlements farther south, the only one of any notable size is &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Williams\"&gt;Puerto Williams&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;an settlement of some 2,000 residents. As a center of population, commerce, and culture, and as a town of significant size and importance, Ushuaia however clearly qualifies as a city. A 1998 article in the newspaper \"Clar\u00edn\" reported that the designation \"Southernmost city in the world\" had been transferred to Puerto Williams by a joint committee from Argentina and Chile, but this was denied by Argentine authorities, and the Secretariat of Tourism of Argentina continues to use the slogan in official documentation and web sites.\nClimate.\nUshuaia features a significantly ocean-moderated (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt;: \"ET\"); bordering on a (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt;: \"Cfc\"), with both extremely mild winters and summers (average temperature remains above 0\u00a0\u00b0C and below 10\u00a0\u00b0C year round). Vegetation around the city thus does not resemble typical tundra but is instead heavily forested. Temperatures at the Ushuaia \u2013 Malvinas Argentinas International Airport average in the coolest month (July), and in the warmest month (January). The record low is in July, and the record high is in January. On average, the city experiences 146 days of precipitation a year, with many cloudy and foggy days, averaging 206 cloudy days a year. This results in Ushuaia receiving an average of 3.93 hours of sunshine per day (an annual total of 1,434 hours) or about 30.2% of possible sunshine. Despite receiving only average annual precipitation, Ushuaia is very humid with an average humidity of 77%.\nSummers tend to be cloudy and windy, with maximum temperatures averaging around during the day and about at night. Temperatures of or more occur only on a handful of days, and night frost is always possible, as well as days below . Temperatures gradually diminish during the autumn, to reach maximum temperatures of about and minimum temperatures of in winter, with frequent snow, sleet and rain showers. Some winters may bring extended periods of frost and snow with a perpetual snowcover, whereas other winters might just bring snowstorms followed by thaws. Temperatures then very slowly recover during the spring, but snow showers and frost are a common occurrence until the beginning of the summer in December, and they might occur even in midsummer.\nThe southwestern winds make the outer islands wetter, reaching at &lt;a href=\"Isla%20de%20los%20Estados\"&gt;Isla de los Estados&lt;/a&gt; (Staten Island). Because temperatures are cool throughout the year, there is little evaporation. Snow is common in winter and regularly occurs throughout the year. Ushuaia occasionally experiences snow in summer (from November to March). Due to its high southern latitude, the city's climate is influenced by Antarctica, and the duration of daylight varies significantly, from more than 17 hours in summer to just over 7 hours in winter.\nEconomy.\nThe main economic activities are &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"natural%20gas\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Petroleum\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; extraction , &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ecotourism\"&gt;ecotourism&lt;/a&gt;.\nTourism.\nTourist attractions include the &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20del%20Fuego%20National%20Park\"&gt;Tierra del Fuego National Park&lt;/a&gt; and Lapataia Bay. The park can be reached by highway, or via the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Fuegian%20Railway\"&gt;End of the World Train&lt;/a&gt; (\"Tren del Fin del Mundo\") from Ushuaia. The city has a museum of Y\u00e1mana, English, and Argentine settlement, including its years as a prison colony. Wildlife attractions include local birds, &lt;a href=\"penguin\"&gt;penguin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Pinniped\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Killer%20whale\"&gt;orcas&lt;/a&gt;, many of these species colonizing islands in the &lt;a href=\"Beagle%20Channel\"&gt;Beagle Channel&lt;/a&gt;. There are daily bus and boat tours to &lt;a href=\"Estancia%20Harberton\"&gt;Harberton&lt;/a&gt;, the Bridges family compound, Estancia Harberton. Tours also visit the &lt;a href=\"Les%20Eclaireurs%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;. Les Eclaireurs is sometimes confused with the \"Lighthouse at the End of the World\" (\"Faro del fin del mundo\") made famous by &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Verne\"&gt;Jules Verne&lt;/a&gt; in the novel of the same name; but the latter lies some 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) east of Ushuaia on &lt;a href=\"Isla%20de%20los%20Estados\"&gt;Isla de los Estados&lt;/a&gt; (Island of the States).\nManufacturing.\nUshuaia's industrial sector, led by the &lt;a href=\"Grundig\"&gt;Grundig&lt;/a&gt; \"Renacer\" &lt;a href=\"electronics\"&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"factory\"&gt;factory&lt;/a&gt;, is among the largest in &lt;a href=\"Patagonia\"&gt;Patagonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nArts and culture.\nSince 2007 Ushuaia has hosted the Bienal de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo del Fin del Mundo (Biennial of Contemporary Art at the End of the World), created and organized by the Patagonia Arte &amp; Desaf\u00edo Foundation under the rubric \"South Pole of the Arts, Sciences, and Ecology\". The Bienal has gathered over one hundred artists from five continents addressing the motto \"think at the End of the World that another world is possible\". As a pedagogical project it encourages students at all levels to \"think about a better world\".\nSports.\nAs in most of Argentina, &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; is a popular sport in Ushuaia, and in 2010 the TV show \"FIFA Futbol Mundial\" did a story about the sport's development in this locality. In 2015 Ushuaia hosted the first &lt;a href=\"Pan-American%20Team%20Handball%20Federation\"&gt;PATHF&lt;/a&gt; Snow Handball Panamerican Championship.\nIce hockey.\nA popular sport in Ushuaia is &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt;, and low temperatures all year long make the city a perfect spot for practicing it outdoors. In 2010 the city opened an outdoor &lt;a href=\"Short%20track%20speed%20skating\"&gt;short track&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20hockey%20rink\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; Olympic-size &lt;a href=\"ice%20rink\"&gt;ice rink&lt;/a&gt; (), the first of its kind in South America. After this Argentina became the first South American nation to be upgraded from affiliate to associate member status of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Ice%20Hockey%20Federation\"&gt;International Ice Hockey Federation&lt;/a&gt; (IIHF).\nSince 2005 the Municipality of Ushuaia and the Argentinean Ice Hockey Federation (FAHH) organize the yearly End of the World Cup (\"Copa del Fin del Mundo\") that has gathered ice hockey teams from Ushuaia, &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Punta%20Arenas\"&gt;Punta Arenas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sao%20Paulo\"&gt;Sao Paulo&lt;/a&gt; and includes seven different competitions: one for men, one for women, four junior categories and an international tournament.\nBeside the local league and the Copa del Fin del Mundo, in 2016 the city hosted the first ice hockey Patagonian Championship, with teams from Ushuaia, &lt;a href=\"R%C3%ADo%20Grande%2C%20Tierra%20del%20Fuego\"&gt;R\u00edo Grande&lt;/a&gt; and Punta Arenas. After the tournament it was announced a new plan to build a roof over the ice rink.\nUshuaia has two rival teams: Club Andino de Ushuaia (CAU) and Los \u00d1ires.\nSkiing.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Ski%20resort\"&gt;ski areas&lt;/a&gt; are located near Ushuaia including Glacier El Martial (on &lt;a href=\"Martial%20Mountains\"&gt;Martial Mountains&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Cerro%20Castor\"&gt;Cerro Castor&lt;/a&gt;. Opened in 1999, Cerro Castor is the southernmost full-fledged ski resort in the world. On Cerro Castor, it is possible to ski just above sea level. The summit reaches an elevation of &lt;a href=\"above%20sea%20level\"&gt;above sea level&lt;/a&gt;, and consistently cool temperatures allow the longest skiing season in South America. Winter temperatures fluctuate between . It has ten elevation facilities and 28 &lt;a href=\"Piste\"&gt;ski trails&lt;/a&gt; for all skill levels. There are cafeterias, mountain huts, a ski school, a first aid room and a forest of beech. Snowboarding, sledding, and snowshoeing are also available at Cerro Castor, in addition to alpine skiing. It is located on the southern side of Cerro Krund, north of Ushuaia. The ski season is typically between June through October. In 2012 Cerro Castor hosted the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20FIS%20Freestyle%20Skiing%20World%20Cup%23Slopestyle\"&gt;FIS Freestyle Slopestyle World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, organized by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Ski%20Federation\"&gt;International Ski Federation&lt;/a&gt; (FIS), and in 2015 it hosted the Interski Congress and World Cup, organized by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Ski%20Instructors%20Association\"&gt;International Ski Instructors Association&lt;/a&gt;, which was its first ever event in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt; is popular even during the summer months, when the &lt;a href=\"chairlift\"&gt;chairlift&lt;/a&gt; operates in both directions. Hiking trails lead from the city's edge to the base of the glacier, which has &lt;a href=\"Retreat%20of%20glaciers%20since%201850\"&gt;retreated&lt;/a&gt; considerably over the past century, as shown in photographs on display at the Antarctic Museum of Ushuaia.\nThe Valley of Tierra Mayor and the Francisco Jerman Nordic Ski Area, located 20\u00a0km and 5\u00a0km away from Ushuaia respectively, are popular &lt;a href=\"Cross-country%20skiing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;cross-country&lt;/a&gt; venues. Since 1986 Tierra Mayor hosts the annual Marchablanca, a 21\u00a0km traditional race organized by the Club Andino Ushuaia, and the &lt;a href=\"Ushuaia%20Loppet\"&gt;Ushuaia Loppet&lt;/a&gt;, a full distance marathon that is one of the 20 members of the &lt;a href=\"Worldloppet%20Ski%20Federation\"&gt;Worldloppet Ski Federation&lt;/a&gt;. Usually this race starts the Federation's Marathon Series in August.\nIn October 2014 the Argentine Olympic Committee (COA) revealed the plan to use the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Summer%20Youth%20Olympics\"&gt;2018 Summer Youth Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, to be held in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, as the launchpad for a bid in the near future. The Committee identified Argentina's south-eastern region of &lt;a href=\"Patagonia\"&gt;Patagonia&lt;/a&gt;, which comprises the southern section of the &lt;a href=\"Andes\"&gt;Andes&lt;/a&gt; mountains, as a possible location to host the Winter Games. In 2010 it was suggested that Ushuaia would be the main option for a bid. Before the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Summer%20Youth%20Olympics\"&gt;2018 Summer Youth Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"IOC\"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Bach\"&gt;Thomas Bach&lt;/a&gt; visited Ushuaia and talked about the possibility of holding the 2024 &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Youth%20Olympics\"&gt;Winter Youth Olympics&lt;/a&gt; here.\nGovernment.\nThe city government consists of a Mayor (executive), City Council (seven members, legislative) and the Tribunal de Faltas (small court, judicial).\nEducation.\nUshuaia has twelve secondary schools, four of which also provide &lt;a href=\"adult%20education\"&gt;adult education&lt;/a&gt;.
