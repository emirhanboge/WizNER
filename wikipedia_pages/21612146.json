Captained by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Lewis%20%28rugby%20player%29\"&gt;Charles Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, Norton entered a team containing ten new caps, after the Welsh team were humiliated in their inaugural game against England. Wales won the game making it the very first international victory for the team. Norton was reselected for the next five matches, completing the entirety of the &lt;a href=\"1883%20Home%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;1883&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1884%20Home%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;1884 Home Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt;s. Wales lost both games of the 1883 Championship, and the opening two games of the 1884 tournament, but were successful for the final game of the series against Ireland. The 1884 Irish game saw the Ireland team arrive two players short and were forced to borrow two Welsh players to complete their team. Although the last game of Norton's international career, he ended by scoring his only &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; for his country.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"
