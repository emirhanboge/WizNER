    "text": "Kevin Leese Mannix (born November 26, 1949) is an American &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt;, business &lt;a href=\"Lawyer\"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt;, and former chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Republican%20Party\"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. state of &lt;a href=\"Oregon\"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;.\nMannix has served in both houses of the &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Oregon Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, as a &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Oregon\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; and, later, a Republican. He is known for his advocacy of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Oregon%20ballot%20measures\"&gt;statewide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Initiatives%20and%20referendums%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;ballot measures&lt;/a&gt; and as a candidate for the statewide offices of &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Attorney%20General\"&gt;attorney general&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Oregon\"&gt;governor&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly political career.\nMannix earned a bachelor's degree in liberal arts in 1971 from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1974, he earned his &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Doctor\"&gt;law degree&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;University of Virginia School of Law&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to serving in the legislature, Mannix worked in several different capacities, including Assistant Attorney General of Oregon, Assistant Attorney General of &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;, and a law clerk to the &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Court%20of%20Appeals\"&gt;Oregon Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;.\nMannix was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives five times beginning in 1988. From 1989 through 1996, Mannix served in the &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Oregon House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; as a Democrat. In 1997, he became a Republican and was appointed to the &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20State%20Senate\"&gt;Oregon State Senate&lt;/a&gt;. He was elected back into the Oregon House in November 1998 and served through 2000.\nBallot measure advocacy.\nMannix is a driving force behind the effort to get tougher sentences for criminals. In 1994, he authored &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Ballot%20Measure%2011%20%281994%29\"&gt;Ballot Measure 11&lt;/a&gt;, which established &lt;a href=\"mandatory%20sentencing\"&gt;mandatory minimum sentence&lt;/a&gt;s for violent crimes, including murder, manslaughter, serious assault, kidnapping, rape, sodomy, unlawful sexual penetration, sexual abuse, and robbery. This measure has also now been used to set automatic sentencing on accidental deaths due to addiction issues. A companion measure, Measure 10, also passed, amending the Oregon Constitution to provide that any criminal sentence established by a vote of the people cannot be reduced by the legislature except with a two-thirds vote of both houses. A third successful Mannix measure, Measure 17, amended the Oregon Constitution to establish a new section which requires that state prison inmates work full-time in useful work. This also allowed work time to include education courses, counseling, and job training.\nIn 1996, Mannix brought &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Ballot%20Measure%2040%20%281996%29%20and%20subsequent%20measures\"&gt;Ballot Measure 40&lt;/a&gt; to the ballot. This contained several victims' rights and anti-crime provisions. The effects of these Measures is to set the primary locus of control in sentencing decisions with victims and prosecutors. Measure 40 passed by a margin of 59% to 41%, but was overturned by the &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;Oregon Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; in \"Armatta v. Kitzhaber\", 327 Or. 250, 959 P.2d 49 (1998) on the grounds that it contained more than one amendment to the &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Constitution\"&gt;Oregon Constitution&lt;/a&gt; and should have been subject to separate votes on each provision.\nMeasure 40 returned to voters by legislative referral (engineered by Representative Mannix) as Measures 69\u201375 in November 1999. Of the seven referral measures four were passed by voters, which granted crime victims the right to be present during trial, to be consulted regarding plea bargains and to be heard at sentencing; limited the pre-trial release of violent criminals by authorizing courts to consider the safety of victims and the public; required that any term of imprisonment imposed by a court to be fully served, with the exception of the governor's clemency power; and prohibited felons from serving on grand juries and criminal trial juries.\nIn 2008, Mannix helped lead a citizen initiative effort for Measure 61 which would have created mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain theft, identity theft, forgery, drug and burglary crimes. This measure was trumped by Measure 57, a legislative referral which avoided mandatory minimum sentences in favor of increased sentences for drug trafficking, theft against the elderly, and certain repeat property and identity theft crimes.\nAnother citizen initiative effort led by Mannix in 2010, Measure 73, was approved. This measure provided a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 25 years for repeat convictions of the worst sex crimes and required a minimum sentence of 90 days in jail, with costs reimbursed to the county by the state, for persons with a third &lt;a href=\"driving%20under%20the%20influence\"&gt;DUII&lt;/a&gt; conviction within 10 years.\nIn 2012, Measure 84, an effort to repeal Oregon's estate tax, was also supported by Mannix but was defeated.\nFor the Oregon 2014 general election, Mannix, and Common Sense For Oregon, are supporting several initiatives including No Taxes on Family Giving and the Oregon Castle Doctrine.\nRuns for statewide office.\nIn 1996, Mannix ran for &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Attorney%20General\"&gt;Oregon Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; as a Democrat. At the last minute, &lt;a href=\"Hardy%20Myers\"&gt;Hardy Myers&lt;/a&gt; was recruited by Democrats to run against Mannix in the Democratic &lt;a href=\"Primary%20election\"&gt;primary&lt;/a&gt;, as some felt Mannix was too &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; for their party. Myers defeated Mannix in the primary 62.8% to 36.8%. Myers went on to easily defeat his Republican opponent in the November &lt;a href=\"general%20election\"&gt;general election&lt;/a&gt;. Mannix changed his party affiliation to Republican the following year, 1997. He was appointed to the state Senate in 1998.\nIn 2000, Mannix again ran for State Attorney General against Myers in a bitter campaign. Myers again defeated Mannix 49.8% to 46.2%. Libertarian candidate Tom Cox received 4.0%. There is the possibility that Cox siphoned off votes from Mannix, although it's far from certain that enough of them would have supported him to deny Myers victory.\nIn 2002, Mannix &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%202002\"&gt;ran&lt;/a&gt; for governor. In the Republican primary, he defeated former &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Bureau%20of%20Labor%20and%20Industries\"&gt;Labor Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Roberts%20%28Oregon%20politician%29\"&gt;Jack Roberts&lt;/a&gt; and Portland attorney and &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Public%20Schools%20%28Oregon%29\"&gt;school board&lt;/a&gt; chair &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Saxton\"&gt;Ron Saxton&lt;/a&gt;. He went on to run against Democrat &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Kulongoski\"&gt;Ted Kulongoski&lt;/a&gt;. Kulongoski won 49% of the vote versus 46% for Mannix. &lt;a href=\"Libertarian%20Party%20of%20Oregon\"&gt;Libertarian&lt;/a&gt; candidate Tom Cox received 5% \u2013 a margin which many observe could have swung the election, had those votes gone to Mannix. The defeat also marked the fifth time in a row the Republicans failed to gain control of the governor's mansion.\nMannix became &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Republican%20Party\"&gt;Oregon Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; Chair in January 2003, and stepped down in 2005.\nIn 2006, Mannix ran again for the Republican nomination for governor. He finished second in the primary with 30% of the vote, behind Saxton, who won the nomination with 43%, and ahead of state senator &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Atkinson\"&gt;Jason Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, who received 22%. Mannix was opposed in the primary by the &lt;a href=\"Confederated%20Tribes%20of%20Grand%20Ronde\"&gt;Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde&lt;/a&gt;, who spent $800,000 opposing the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Gorge%20casino\"&gt;Columbia Gorge casino&lt;/a&gt; in the 2006 Democratic and Republican primaries. Saxton, widely considered more moderate than Mannix, went on to lose the general election in May to incumbent Kulongoski by an 8.1% margin.\nIn 2008, Mannix ran for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%20in%20Oregon%2C%202008%23District%205\"&gt;U.S. House primary election&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Oregon%27s%205th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;Oregon's 5th congressional district&lt;/a&gt; to succeed retiring Democrat &lt;a href=\"Darlene%20Hooley\"&gt;Darlene Hooley&lt;/a&gt;. Mannix ran a vigorous campaign, but was narrowly defeated by &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Erickson\"&gt;Mike Erickson&lt;/a&gt;, who went on to lose to &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Schrader\"&gt;Kurt Schrader&lt;/a&gt; in the general election due in part to personal issues that Mannix brought up in the primary.\nOther accomplishments.\nMannix serves as president for several organizations, including the Oregon Anti-Crime Alliance, which he founded in 2008, and Common Sense For Oregon, which he founded in 2009. He is a member of the board of directors for the Salem Catholic Schools Foundation, a role he has served since 1985, and has been president of the foundation since 2000.\nMannix was a founder and has served as chairman of the board of directors for Blanchet Catholic School in Salem since it opened in 1995, is a member of the Knights of Columbus and has been a member of Rotary International since 1982.\nMannix has served on the national board of directors for Life Directions and the Salem Chamber of Commerce board of directors from 2007 to 2013.\nMannix is also a board member, and vice president, of the Johann Strauss Society of America Foundation. This organization was founded in 2013 and is dedicated to supporting the music heritage of Johann Strauss.\nFunding.\nMannix's main financial donor in his political career is &lt;a href=\"Loren%20Parks\"&gt;Loren Parks&lt;/a&gt;, a businessman who is currently a resident of Nevada. Loren Parks has contributed over $4 million to Mannix's political efforts since 1994.\nElectoral history.\n2008 race for U.S. House of Representatives \u2013 Republican primary\n2006 race for governor \u2013 Republican primary\n2002 race for governor\n2002 race for governor \u2013 Republican primary\n2000 race for state attorney general\n2000 race for state attorney general \u2013 Republican primary\n1998 Oregon general election\n1998 Oregon primary election\n1996 Oregon general election\n1996 Oregon primary election\n1994 Oregon primary election\n1992 Oregon general election\n1992 Oregon primary election\n1990 Oregon general election\n1990 Oregon primary election\n1988 Oregon general election\n1988 Oregon primary election "
