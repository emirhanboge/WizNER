    "text": "Howland &amp; Aspinwall was a merchant firm based in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; in the 1830s and 1840s. It specialized in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; trade, especially the importing of goods from &lt;a href=\"Old%20China%20Trade\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. It is best known for taking a pioneering role in the financing of &lt;a href=\"clipper%20ship\"&gt;clipper ship&lt;/a&gt;s, especially the American-built \"&lt;a href=\"Rainbow%20%28clipper%29\"&gt;Rainbow&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Sea%20Witch%20%28clipper%29\"&gt;Sea Witch&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHistory.\nThe firm, originally known as &lt;a href=\"G.G.%20%26amp%3B%20S.S.%20Howland\"&gt;G.G. &amp; S.S. Howland&lt;/a&gt;, was founded by brothers &lt;a href=\"Gardiner%20Greene%20Howland\"&gt;Gardiner Greene Howland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Shaw%20Howland\"&gt;Samuel Shaw Howland&lt;/a&gt;. In 1832, upon the admission of their clerk, &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Aspinwall\"&gt;William Henry Aspinwall&lt;/a&gt;, the firm became known as Howland &amp; Aspinwall.\nHowland &amp; Aspinwall imported high-status goods such as &lt;a href=\"porcelain\"&gt;porcelain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"silk\"&gt;silk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"tea\"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt; from China, and sold them to Americans of means. Import duties paid by firms such as Howland &amp; Aspinwall played a significant role in the financing of the American &lt;a href=\"Federal%20budget%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;federal budget&lt;/a&gt; during the 1840s. Howland &amp; Aspinwall exported &lt;a href=\"opium\"&gt;opium&lt;/a&gt; to China. \nPacific Mail Steamship Company.\nIn 1848, as a result of the United States's acquisition of &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, partners G.S. Howland, S.S. Howland, and &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Aspinwall\"&gt;William Henry Aspinwall&lt;/a&gt; turned their attention from the China trade to California traffic. Improvements in the &lt;a href=\"marine%20steam%20engine\"&gt;marine steam engine&lt;/a&gt; had begun to make clipper ships and other fast sailing ships obsolete. With other New York businessmen, the Howland and Aspinwall interests formed the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Mail%20Steamship%20Company\"&gt;Pacific Mail Steamship Company&lt;/a&gt;. Pacific Mail eventually became &lt;a href=\"American%20President%20Lines\"&gt;American President Lines&lt;/a&gt;, which is now part of &lt;a href=\"Neptune%20Orient%20Lines\"&gt;Neptune Orient Lines&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nPart of the Aspinwall family fortune was eventually bequeathed, through paternal grandmother &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Roosevelt%20%28businessman%29%23Personal%20life\"&gt;Mary Aspinwall Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, 32nd President of the United States."
