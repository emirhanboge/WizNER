    "text": "The Chief Minister (Manx: \"Ard-shirveishagh\") is the executive head of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man%20Government\"&gt;Isle of Man Government&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe office derives from that of Chairman of the Executive Council. Before 1980 the Executive Council was chaired by the &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20the%20Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Lieutenant Governor&lt;/a&gt;, but thereafter the chairman was elected by &lt;a href=\"Tynwald\"&gt;Tynwald&lt;/a&gt;, the parliament of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/a&gt;. The title was changed to \"Chief Minister\" in 1986.\nThe Chief Minister is appointed by the Lieutenant Governor on the nomination of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Keys\"&gt;House of Keys&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the nomination of Tynwald) after a general election for the House of Keys. He holds office until the next general election (i.e. normally for five years) and is eligible for re-appointment, but may be removed from office by simple majority in Tynwald on a vote of no confidence in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Ministers%20%28Isle%20of%20Man%29\"&gt;Council of Ministers&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter the general election in November 2006, Mr John Shimmin &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Keys\"&gt;MHK&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Stephen Rodan MHK (Minister for Health and Social Security) and Mr David Cannan MHK (former Minister for the Treasury) sought nomination as Chief Minister, but none received the necessary majority of votes in Tynwald. In a second vote Mr Tony Brown (Speaker of the House of Keys) was nominated unopposed.\nTony Brown stepped down from the role as Chief Minister on 29 September 2011. His successor from 9 December 2011 was &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Bell\"&gt;Allan Bell&lt;/a&gt;. On 1 August 2016 Allan Bell announced that he would retire, after 32 years representing Ramsey in the House of Keys, following seven years as a Ramsey Commissioner. &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Quayle\"&gt;Howard Quayle&lt;/a&gt; took office on 4 October 2016 and served until 2021. He was succeeded as Chief Minister on 12 October 2021 by &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Cannan\"&gt;Alfred Cannan&lt;/a&gt;."
