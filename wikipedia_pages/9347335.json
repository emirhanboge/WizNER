    "text": "Peter O'Rourke (1 June 1873 \u2013 10 January 1956) was a Scottish &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;. In two spells as manager of &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt;, he won the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1911%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1911&lt;/a&gt; as well as two league titles, the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Football League Second Division&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1907%E2%80%9308%20Football%20League\"&gt;1908&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North\"&gt;Third Division North&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1928%E2%80%9329%20Football%20League\"&gt;1929&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nO'Rourke was a &lt;a href=\"defender%20%28football%29\"&gt;centre half&lt;/a&gt; who played for &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burnley%20F.C.\"&gt;Burnley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Lincoln City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Third%20Lanark\"&gt;Third Lanark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chesterfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Chesterfield&lt;/a&gt; before his final playing days at &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt;. He became player-manager in 1905 following the departure of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Campbell%20%28football%20manager%29\"&gt;Robert Campbell&lt;/a&gt; while he was still captain. He was given the job permanently and in December 1905 played his final game in an &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; tie against &lt;a href=\"Darlington%20F.C.\"&gt;Darlington&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe led the Bantams to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; championship in 1908. Three years later, O'Rourke clinched the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; with Bradford in 1911, beating &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in a replay. His son, Francis, died in Newfoundland in October 1919, affecting him deeply, and in June 1921, due to ill health, O'Rourke retired from the game.\nHe came back with Welsh side &lt;a href=\"Pontypridd%20Town%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Pontypridd&lt;/a&gt; in 1922 for five months. In December of that year, O'Rourke joined &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee Hibernian&lt;/a&gt;, who were then a non-league club, but stayed for only three months, resigning after lacking financial support. His next managerial job was with &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20%28Park%20Avenue%29%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford Park Avenue&lt;/a&gt; from 1924 to 1925. He spent just ten months at Park Avenue but signed another son, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20O%27Rourke%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201903%29\"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, who scored twice on his debut against &lt;a href=\"Durham%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Durham City&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe returned to Bradford City in 1928, winning the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Division%20North\"&gt;Third Division North&lt;/a&gt; the following year. After leaving Bradford for the second time in 1930, he moved to Walsall, before a final managerial spell with &lt;a href=\"Llanelli%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Llanelli&lt;/a&gt;. He retired in July 1933.\nAfter retiring, O'Rourke returned to Bradford living in Burlington Terrace next to City's &lt;a href=\"Valley%20Parade\"&gt;Valley Parade&lt;/a&gt; ground until he died in January 1956 at the age of 82.\nHonours.\nManager.\nBradford City"
