    "title": "Cabinet de Broglie II (France)",
    "text": "The Second Cabinet of Albert de Broglie is the 57th cabinet of &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the fifth of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Third%20Republic\"&gt;Third Republic&lt;/a&gt;, seating from 26 November 1873 to 22 May 1874, headed by &lt;a href=\"Albert%2C%204th%20duc%20de%20Broglie\"&gt;Albert de Broglie&lt;/a&gt; as Vice-President of the Council of Ministers and &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28France%29\"&gt;Minister of Interior&lt;/a&gt;, under the presidency of &lt;a href=\"Patrice%20de%20MacMahon\"&gt;Patrice de MacMahon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe cabinet was formed on 26 November 1873, following the approval of the septennate by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20%281871%29\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. Albert de Broglie stayed head of government, but exchanged his position of Minister of Foreign Affairs with the one of Minister of Interior.\nIn many ways this government was a reshuffle. Monarchists ministers displeased by the fact that a King would not be restored soon resigned. de Broglie faced opposition by the &lt;a href=\"Legitimists\"&gt;Legitimists&lt;/a&gt; that signified they would not help him this time. With the intervention of MacMahon, a new cabinet was secured and new ministers were appointed, notably &lt;a href=\"Charles%20de%20Larcy\"&gt;Charles de Larcy&lt;/a&gt;, who was minister under the republican &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Dufaure\"&gt;Jules Dufaure&lt;/a&gt;.\nFour new Undersecretaries of State were appointed, while only one or two were called under previous administrations ; the nomination of an Undersecretary of State for the Ministry of Public Instruction was particularly consistent with the cabinet's policy. Indeed, de Broglie, pursued the \"Ordre Moral\" started with his first cabinet.\nA turning point of the government was a bill introduced in the Assembly in January 1874 that would put appointments of certain officials in the hands of the Minister of Interior or its subordinates, the &lt;a href=\"Prefect%20%28France%29\"&gt;prefects&lt;/a&gt;. The bill was initially defeated by a vote of Legitimists realizing the consequences of the septennate voted in November 1873 ; MacMahon, as president, would keep his place until 1880, making it less than likely an early restoration. This led to de Broglie to offer his resignation, but the president refused it. The government survived a vote of no confidence and secured a vote for the bill that finally passed the Assembly.\nThe cabinet was dissolved on 22 May 1874 with the withdrawal of the Legitimists. It was replaced when &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Courtot%20de%20Cissey\"&gt;Ernest Courtot de Cissey&lt;/a&gt;, former Minister of War under &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Dufaure\"&gt;Jules Dufaure&lt;/a&gt; was called to form a new government."
