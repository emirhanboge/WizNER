    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Turkmenistan\"&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt; is a country with large potential for an expanded tourism industry. Many of its &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt;n cities were main points of trade on the &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Road\"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt;, linking Eastern and Western civilizations. Many neighboring countries (including &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uzbekistan\"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;) promote their countries based on their location along the Great Silk Road. Tourism has grown rapidly in recent years. Tourists from abroad are deterred by the restrictive &lt;a href=\"visa%20policy%20of%20Turkmenistan\"&gt;visa policy regime&lt;/a&gt; with all countries of the world. Tourism is regulated by the &lt;a href=\"Tourism%20Committee%20of%20Turkmenistan\"&gt;Tourism Committee of Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistorical sites.\nThere are three World Heritage Sites in Turkmenistan.\n&lt;a href=\"Nisa%2C%20Turkmenistan\"&gt;Nisa&lt;/a&gt; (also Parthaunisa) was an ancient city, located near modern-day Bagyr, a neighbourhood in &lt;a href=\"Ashgabat\"&gt;Ashgabat&lt;/a&gt; 18\u00a0km southwest of downtown. Nisa is described by some as one of the first capitals of the &lt;a href=\"Parthia\"&gt;Parthia&lt;/a&gt;ns. It is traditionally assumed to have been founded by &lt;a href=\"Arsaces%20I%20of%20Parthia\"&gt;Arsaces I&lt;/a&gt; (reigned c. 250 BC\u2013211 BC), and was reputedly the royal &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arsacid%20Empire\"&gt;Parthian kings&lt;/a&gt;, although it has not been established that the fortress at Nisa was either a royal residence or a mausoleum.\n&lt;a href=\"Merv\"&gt;Merv&lt;/a&gt;, formerly an &lt;a href=\"Achaemenid\"&gt;Achaemenid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Satrap\"&gt;Satrap&lt;/a&gt;y of &lt;a href=\"Margiana\"&gt;Margiana&lt;/a&gt;, and later Alexandria and Antiochia in Margiana, was a major &lt;a href=\"oasis\"&gt;oasis&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt;, on the historical &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Road\"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt;, located near today's &lt;a href=\"Mary%2C%20Turkmenistan\"&gt;Mary&lt;/a&gt;. Several cities have existed on this site, which is significant for the interchange of culture and politics at a site of major strategic value. It is claimed that Merv was briefly &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20largest%20cities%20throughout%20history\"&gt;the largest city in the world&lt;/a&gt; in the 12th century.\n&lt;a href=\"Konye-Urgench\"&gt;Konye-Urgench&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"municipality\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; of about 30,000 inhabitants in north-eastern &lt;a href=\"Turkmenistan\"&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;, just south out the border with &lt;a href=\"Uzbekistan\"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;. It is the site of the ancient town of \u00dcrgen\u00e7, which contains the unexcavated ruins of the 12th-century capital of &lt;a href=\"Khwarezm\"&gt;Khwarezm&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2005, the ruins of Old Urgench have been protected by &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;. (\"See\" &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20Turkmenistan\"&gt;List of World Heritage Sites in Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;)\nResorts and nature tourism.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20Sea\"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast of Turkmenistan is the site of a number of popular sea resorts, including the &lt;a href=\"Awaza\"&gt;Awaza&lt;/a&gt; National Resort Zone.\nWildlife areas in the desert and other attractions.\nDesert fauna of &lt;a href=\"Karakum%20Desert\"&gt;Karakum&lt;/a&gt; include many kinds of rare animals. There is a Karakum nature reserve at the flood-land drained by the &lt;a href=\"Amu%20Darya\"&gt;Amu Darya&lt;/a&gt;.\nNear &lt;a href=\"Derweze\"&gt;Derweze&lt;/a&gt; village in the middle of the Karakum Desert is a &lt;a href=\"natural%20gas\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; deposit. While drilling in 1971, Soviet geologists tapped into a cavern filled with natural gas. The ground beneath the drilling rig collapsed, creating the &lt;a href=\"Darvaza%20gas%20crater\"&gt;Darvaza gas crater&lt;/a&gt;, a large hole with a diameter of at . To avoid poisonous gas discharge, it was decided the best solution was to burn it off. Geologists had hoped the fire would use all the fuel in a matter of days, but the gas is still burning today. Locals have dubbed the cavern the \"Door to Hell\".\nAccessibility of the country.\nMost trips to Turkmenistan begin with arrival at the capital &lt;a href=\"Ashgabat\"&gt;Ashgabat&lt;/a&gt; or the seaside town &lt;a href=\"T%C3%BCrkmenba%C5%9Fy%2C%20Turkmenistan\"&gt;Turkmenbashy&lt;/a&gt;. Ashgabat has a modern &lt;a href=\"Ashgabat%20Airport\"&gt;international airport&lt;/a&gt;, which is the base of &lt;a href=\"Turkmenistan%20Airlines\"&gt;Turkmenistan Airlines&lt;/a&gt;. The airport is served by &lt;a href=\"S7%20Airlines\"&gt;S7 Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Airlines\"&gt;Turkish Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flydubai\"&gt;Flydubai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belavia\"&gt;Belavia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"China%20Southern%20Airlines\"&gt;China Southern Airlines&lt;/a&gt; as well as the national carrier, &lt;a href=\"Turkmenistan%20Airlines\"&gt;Turkmenistan Airlines&lt;/a&gt;. Another five airports in Turkmenistan (Turkmenabat, Dashoguz, Mary, Turkmenbashy, and Kerki) have international status. Because of current restrictions, tickets for domestic flights cannot be booked or purchased more than 14 days prior to departure. \nCOVID pandemic.\nDue to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; global pandemic, scheduled international flights have been curtailed, and only special charter flights are allowed in and out of the country. Such flights arrive at Turkmenabat, where arriving passengers undergo a 21-day quarantine.\nMuseums.\nMost museums are located in the major cities of Turkmenistan such as Ashgabat, Turkmenabat, Balkanabat, Mary and Dashoguz. Some of these include:\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Serdar%20%28city%29\"&gt;Serdar&lt;/a&gt; features a fine local history museum, and the city of &lt;a href=\"Bereket\"&gt;Bereket&lt;/a&gt; a railroad museum.\nNumber of tourists annually.\nForeign visitor arrivals in 2011.\nThe three following countries had the most tourists visiting Turkmenistan in 2011:"
