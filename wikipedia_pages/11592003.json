    "text": "Health Systems Engineering or Health Engineering (often known as \"Health Care Systems Engineering (HCSE)\") is an academic and a pragmatic discipline that approaches the &lt;a href=\"health%20care\"&gt;health care&lt;/a&gt; industry, and other industries connected with health care delivery, as &lt;a href=\"complex%20adaptive%20system\"&gt;complex adaptive system&lt;/a&gt;s, and identifies and applies engineering design and analysis principles in such areas. This can overlap with &lt;a href=\"biomedical%20engineering\"&gt;biomedical engineering&lt;/a&gt; which focuses on design and development of various medical products; &lt;a href=\"industrial%20engineering\"&gt;industrial engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"operations%20management\"&gt;operations management&lt;/a&gt; which involve improving organizational operations; and various health care practice fields like &lt;a href=\"medicine\"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pharmacy\"&gt;pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dentistry\"&gt;dentistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nursing\"&gt;nursing&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Other fields participating in this interdisciplinary area include &lt;a href=\"public%20health\"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"information%20technology\"&gt;information technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"management\"&gt;management&lt;/a&gt; studies, and regulatory &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople whose work implicates this field in some capacity can include members of all the above-noted fields, many of which have sub-fields targeted toward health care matters even if health or health care is not a principal focus of the overall field (e.g. management, law). Areas of &lt;a href=\"biomedical%20engineering\"&gt;biomedical engineering&lt;/a&gt; (BME) in this area often include &lt;a href=\"clinical%20engineering\"&gt;clinical engineering&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes also called \"hospital engineering\") as well as those BMEs developing &lt;a href=\"medical%20devices\"&gt;medical devices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pharmaceutical%20drug\"&gt;pharmaceutical drug&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"industrial%20engineering\"&gt;industrial engineering&lt;/a&gt; (IE) principles employed tend to include optimization, decision analysis, &lt;a href=\"human%20factors%20engineering\"&gt;human factors engineering&lt;/a&gt;, quality engineering, and value engineering."
