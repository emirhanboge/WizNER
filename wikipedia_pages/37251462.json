The boat had a &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20company\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; of between forty-four and sixty.\nService history.\nThe submarine was &lt;a href=\"Keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 21 May 1940 at &lt;a href=\"Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss\"&gt;Blohm &amp; Voss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; as yard number 545, &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 20 March 1941 and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 8 May under the command of \"&lt;a href=\"Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant\"&gt;Kapit\u00e4nleutnant&lt;/a&gt;\" Hans-Peter Hinsch.\nShe served with the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20U-boat%20Flotilla\"&gt;3rd U-boat Flotilla&lt;/a&gt; from 1 August 1941 for training and stayed with that organization for operations until her loss from 1 August 1941 to 22 May 1943.\nFirst and second patrols.\n\"U-569\"s first patrol was from &lt;a href=\"Trondheim\"&gt;Trondheim&lt;/a&gt; in Norway, she headed for the Atlantic Ocean via the &lt;a href=\"GIUK%20gap\"&gt;gap&lt;/a&gt; separating &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Faroe%20Islands\"&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/a&gt;. She arrived at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Nazaire\"&gt;St. Nazaire&lt;/a&gt; in occupied France, on 21 September 1941.\nHaving left St. Nazaire on 12 October 1941, \"U-569\" made for the &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/a&gt; coast. She returned to her French base on 12 November.\nThird patrol.\nThe submarine was attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Fairey%20Swordfish\"&gt;Fairey Swordfish&lt;/a&gt; west of &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt; on 16 December 1941. She, along with four other U-boats, was to have operated in the Mediterranean, but the damage was such that she had to return to St. Nazaire.\nFourth and fifth patrols.\n\"U-569\" sank the \"Hengist\" on 8 March 1942 northwest of &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Wrath\"&gt;Cape Wrath&lt;/a&gt; (Scotland) and returned to France (&lt;a href=\"La%20Pallice\"&gt;La Pallice&lt;/a&gt;), on 2 April 1942.\nOn her fifth sortie, she damaged the \"Pontypridd\" northeast of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Johns%2C%20Newfoundland\"&gt;St. Johns, Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;, on 11 June 1942 and took the master prisoner. She returned to La Pallice on the 28th.\nSixth and seventh patrols.\nThe boat was attacked by the Norwegian corvette HNoMS &lt;a href=\"Flower-class%20corvette\"&gt;\"Potentilla\"&lt;/a&gt; on 25 August 1942. The warship lost the element of surprise and her intention to ram when her 4 in gun opened fire prematurely. Several hits were scored on the &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt; by 20mm AA guns, but the larger weapon failed to register in the encounter in mid-Atlantic.\nThe boat's seventh patrol was relatively peaceful with no contacts.\nEighth patrol.\n\"U-569\" was attacked by the escorts of &lt;a href=\"CU%20convoys\"&gt;Convoy UC-1&lt;/a&gt; on 23 February 1943 and seriously damaged. She had departed La Pallice on 7 February 1943 and returned there on 13 March.\nNinth patrol and loss.\nThe boat was badly damaged by &lt;a href=\"depth%20charge\"&gt;depth charge&lt;/a&gt;s dropped by a &lt;a href=\"TBM%20Avenger\"&gt;TBM Avenger&lt;/a&gt;, piloted by William F. Chamberlain, from the escort carrier on 22 May 1943. A relief Avenger also from USS \"Bogue\", piloted by Howard S. Roberts, was waiting overhead when the U-boat resurfaced. Roberts dropped more depth charges and machine-gunned the bridge to prevent the German crew from manning the &lt;a href=\"antiaircraft\"&gt;antiaircraft&lt;/a&gt; guns. U-boat Commander Johannsen had no intention of fighting back and, according to American records ordered his crew to raise a &lt;a href=\"white%20flag\"&gt;white flag&lt;/a&gt; on the periscope. Upon seeing this, Roberts ceased his attack and guided the Canadian destroyer to the area. As the destroyer approached, Johannsen ordered his crew to scuttle the boat and jump overboard. \"St. Laurent\" rescued Johannsen and 24 of his crew of 46 and the survivors were sent to Washington for interrogation.\nWolfpacks.\n\"U-569\" took part in 15 &lt;a href=\"Wolfpack%20%28naval%20tactic%29\"&gt;wolfpacks&lt;/a&gt;, namely"
