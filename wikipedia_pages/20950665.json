    "text": "Toulouse Olympique Broncos are a semi-professional &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; team based in &lt;a href=\"Toulouse\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt; in the south of &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. Formerly called Toulouse Jules-Julien Broncos XIII the club changed name at the end of the 2011-12 season after being taken over by &lt;a href=\"Toulouse%20Olympique\"&gt;Toulouse Olympique&lt;/a&gt;. Formed in 1980, they currently play in the &lt;a href=\"Elite%20One%20Championship\"&gt;Elite One Championship&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nFounded in 1980 as Association Sportive Toulouse Jules-Julien XIII the club joined the amateur ranks in rugby league. In 1987 a youth academy was set up running teams from 4 years and up. The club was promoted in 1994 after winning the &lt;a href=\"National%20Division%202\"&gt;National Division 2&lt;/a&gt; title. During the following season the club, after getting into financial trouble, had to withdraw from the league. It wasn't until 2010 that a senior side reappeared, they were created to compete in the &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Two%20Championship\"&gt;Elite Two Championship&lt;/a&gt;. During this time the youth sides had still competed. Before the 2012/13 season had started, the senior side moved under the umbrella of city neighbours &lt;a href=\"Toulouse%20Olympique\"&gt;Toulouse Olympique&lt;/a&gt; changing their name to the current one used today. In 2015 following Toulouse Olympique's acceptance into the British &lt;a href=\"League%201%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;League 1&lt;/a&gt; competition, the Broncos were moved up to the &lt;a href=\"Elite%20One%20Championship\"&gt;Elite One Championship&lt;/a&gt; to replace the departing Toulouse club and to also act as their feeder team, while also maintaining a Toulouse presence in the French League.\nThe original club name Toulouse Jules-Julien XIII lives on to this day at academy level with teams from ages 4 to 20.\nColours and badge.\nThe original club played in predominantly red with yellow, after being taken over the club used the same colours as their parent club, blue and white.
