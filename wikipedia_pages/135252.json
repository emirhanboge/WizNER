    "text": "Jefferson City (originally named Mossy Creek) is a &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20County%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Jefferson County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tennessee\"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, United States. It is part of the &lt;a href=\"Morristown%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Morristown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Morristown%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Metropolitan Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt;. As of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt; the population was 8,047.\nHistory.\nHeading southwest along the &lt;a href=\"Holston%20River\"&gt;Holston River&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, Adam and Elizabeth Peck arrived on the banks of Mossy Creek in 1788, soon settling the area with a fort, a house of worship, and a &lt;a href=\"gristmill\"&gt;gristmill&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is suggested that original name of the city, Mossy Creek, originated due to the first settlers' description of the 'vivid' green &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt; developed around a creek near the settlement. By 1797, Mossy Creek had around 75 to 100 families with a four-mile-radius of the city.\nAround the beginnings of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in September 1861, &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army%20of%20Tennessee\"&gt;Union Army&lt;/a&gt; General &lt;a href=\"Ambrose%20Burnside\"&gt;Ambrose Burnside&lt;/a&gt; liberated the city from the &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20Army\"&gt;Confederacy&lt;/a&gt;, but was attacked in an unsuccessful siege by Confederate General &lt;a href=\"James%20Longstreet\"&gt;James Longstreet&lt;/a&gt;. Several skirmishes took place around Mossy Creek, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mossy%20Creek\"&gt;Battle of Mossy Creek&lt;/a&gt; on December 19, 1863.\nIn the later 19th century, two communities formed around Mossy Creek, Frame Addition and Carsonville. In 1901, Mossy Creek merged with the two communities, incorporating as Jefferson City.\nIn 1940, the &lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority\"&gt;Tennessee Valley Authority&lt;/a&gt; (TVA) began purchasing property in Jefferson City for the construction of &lt;a href=\"Cherokee%20Dam\"&gt;Cherokee Dam&lt;/a&gt; and the impounding of the Holston River for &lt;a href=\"Cherokee%20Lake\"&gt;Cherokee Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Many residents reluctantly gave up their farms and homes for the promise of &lt;a href=\"flood%20control\"&gt;flood control&lt;/a&gt; and electricity offered by the TVA. Construction brought many new residents to the city, and Cherokee Lake made Jefferson City a popular recreational hub for locals and tourists alike.\nIn the late 20th century, Jefferson City became industrialized with the &lt;a href=\"Zinc%20mining%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;zinc mining industry&lt;/a&gt; after geologists discovered valuable zinc ore deposits around the city earlier in the century.\nSince 2010, &lt;a href=\"redevelopment\"&gt;redevelopment&lt;/a&gt; and revitalization efforts have been underway in the downtown district of Jefferson City. The Mossy Creek Foundation, a &lt;a href=\"501%28c%29%283%29%20organization\"&gt;501(c)(3) organization&lt;/a&gt;, was established in 2012 to advance these efforts, receiving funding a for a public park with a mock &lt;a href=\"train%20depot\"&gt;train depot&lt;/a&gt; pavilion on the original site of the Mossy Creek station, and &lt;a href=\"facade\"&gt;facade&lt;/a&gt; grants for existing structures downtown.\nGeography.\nJefferson City is located in northern Jefferson County at (36.116389, -83.486500).
