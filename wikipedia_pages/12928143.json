    "text": "American Dreier Looping (formerly Monta\u00f1a Infinitum [\"Infinitum Mountain\"] (2007-2014), Monta\u00f1a Triple Loop [\"Triple Loop Mountain\"] (2014-2016) and Quimera [\"Chimera\"] (2017-2019)) is an upcoming &lt;a href=\"roller%20coaster\"&gt;roller coaster&lt;/a&gt; under construction at &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Beach\"&gt;Indiana Beach&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Monticello%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Monticello, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;.\nManufactured by &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Schwarzkopf\"&gt;Anton Schwarzkopf&lt;/a&gt;, it was originally purchased by showman Rudolf Barth in 1984 who operated it as Dreier Looping for 12 years on the German fair circuit.\nAfter this, it was the main attraction in three major theme parks: first spending 2 years in &lt;a href=\"Sunway%20Lagoon\"&gt;Sunway Lagoon&lt;/a&gt; as Triple Loop Coaster, next, it spent 5 years in &lt;a href=\"Flamingo%20Land\"&gt;Flamingo Land&lt;/a&gt; resort as Magnum Force, and finally at its third and most recent location at &lt;a href=\"La%20Feria%20de%20Chapultepec\"&gt;La Feria Chapultepec M\u00e1gico&lt;/a&gt;, as Monta\u00f1a Triple Loop. In 2017 it was renamed Quimera. In 2022, it will open at &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Beach\"&gt;Indiana Beach&lt;/a&gt; as American Dreier Looping.\nOn September 28, 2019, the derailment of the last car at an approximate height of 33\u00a0ft (10 m) resulted in 5 injuries and 2 deaths. This accident was much like that of another Schwarzkopf looping coaster, &lt;a href=\"Mindbender%20%28Galaxyland%29\"&gt;Mindbender&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe coaster first operated as \"Dreier Looping\" in 1984. Dreier Looping was one of many massive Schwarzkopf traveling coasters to make its debut during this period of time, alongside units including the famed \"Alpina Bahn\", \"&lt;a href=\"Olympia%20Looping\"&gt;Olympia Looping&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Doppel Looping\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Tsunami%20%28roller%20coaster%29\"&gt;Thriller&lt;/a&gt;\" traveling coasters. Dreier Looping, which is German for \"Triple Loop\", also became the first roller coaster to feature three &lt;a href=\"vertical%20loop\"&gt;vertical loop&lt;/a&gt;s. It was purchased by showman Rudolf Barth, and operated on the German fair circuit for 12 years. Dreier Looping made its last fairground stop in 1996.\nThe coaster was then purchased by the recently opened &lt;a href=\"Sunway%20Lagoon\"&gt;Sunway Lagoon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, where it operated as Triple Loop Coaster; a complete English translation of the German name \"Dreier Looping\". It was also outfitted with a pink and white colour scheme. Despite its renovations to fit in at the park, it was placed for sale during the 1999 season and promptly removed.\nIts next stop would be at the &lt;a href=\"Flamingo%20Land\"&gt;Flamingo Land&lt;/a&gt; park in &lt;a href=\"North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;North Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. They had bought the coaster in June 1999, and was rechristened as the \"Magnum Force\". It adopted a white and red paint scheme, although much of the ride's taller portions were painted completely white, presumably to blend in with the skyline a little more. It was put up for sale in 2005 alongside \"Bullet\", another Schwarzkopf looping coaster in the park, and both were promptly removed after the 2005 season. They were replaced by &lt;a href=\"Kumali\"&gt;Kumali&lt;/a&gt;, which debuted the next year and primarily utilizes Bullet's site. As of 2020, the Magnum Force plot of land has remained empty.\nMagnum Force would then be sold to &lt;a href=\"La%20Feria%20de%20Chapultepec\"&gt;La Feria Chapultepec M\u00e1gico&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. In order to accommodate it, the park's existing Rat\u00f3n Loco had to be relocated to the park's lower level. It was outfitted with a brand new yellow-white-blue paint scheme and rechristened \"Monta\u00f1a Infinitum\". Around 2014, it would be renamed \"Monta\u00f1a Triple Loop\" (Triple Loop Mountain), and later \"Quimera\" in 2017, receiving another repaint in the meantime.\n2019 accident.\nOn September 28, 2019, the derailment of the last car at an approximate height of 33\u00a0ft (10 m) resulted in 5 injuries and 2 deaths. This accident was much like that of another Schwarzkopf looping coaster, &lt;a href=\"Mindbender%20%28Galaxyland%29\"&gt;Mindbender&lt;/a&gt;. This accident lead to government officials investigating the park, who found that design flaws and little-to-no maintenance on the ride were to blame. The coaster's track, supports, and trains had also deteriorated due to the coaster being run much faster than it was intended to be. On October 13, the Mexican amusement park authorities announced the indefinite closure of the park, and revoked their operational license. La Feria has since not reopened, but several companies have been in a bid to buy the park.\nFuture.\nIn late 2020, Quimera was reportedly being carefully dismantled for relocation from La Feria. The park's Rat\u00f3n Loco and several other rides had already been removed from the site some time ago. However, it wasn't until the days leading up to the announcement that individuals with inside knowledge had posted information online regarding Quimera's future, stating that it would find a new home at &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Beach\"&gt;Indiana Beach&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Monticello%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Monticello, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors promptly began to circulate, but it was only days later, on November 24, 2020, that until Indiana Beach released a press statement confirming such. Alongside a used &lt;a href=\"Octopus%20%28ride%29\"&gt;Polyp&lt;/a&gt; attraction, it was undergoing a complete refurbishment and is currently intended to open for the summer of 2022 (originally 2021).\nOn January 19, 2021, Indiana Beach announced that the new coaster would be placed in the gravel parking lot west of &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Hawg\"&gt;Steel Hawg&lt;/a&gt;.\nReferences.\nhttps://www.radioformula.com.mx/noticias/20191013/la-feria-de-chapultepec-anuncia-cierre-definitivo/"
