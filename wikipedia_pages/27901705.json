    "text": "Ernest Francis Carless (9 September 1912 \u2013 26 September 1987) was a &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20people\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;er. Carless was a right-handed &lt;a href=\"batsman%20%28cricket%29\"&gt;batsman&lt;/a&gt; who played primarily as a &lt;a href=\"wicketkeeper\"&gt;wicketkeeper&lt;/a&gt;. He also bowled right-arm off-breaks though he did not bowl in first-class cricket. Carless played &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20Football%20League\"&gt;the Football League&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Cardiff City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.\"&gt;Plymouth Argyle&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"inside%20forward\"&gt;inside forward&lt;/a&gt;. He was born at &lt;a href=\"Cadoxton%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan\"&gt;Cadoxton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glamorgan\"&gt;Glamorgan&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarless made his &lt;a href=\"first-class%20cricket\"&gt;first-class&lt;/a&gt; debut for &lt;a href=\"Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Glamorgan&lt;/a&gt; in 1934 against &lt;a href=\"Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Middlesex&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Brierley\"&gt;Tom Brierley&lt;/a&gt; kept wicket in this match; he played one further match for the county in that season, against &lt;a href=\"Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt;, when Carless kept wicket. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; he played for the club in fund-raising matches. Following the end of the war and the resumption of &lt;a href=\"County%20Cricket\"&gt;County Cricket&lt;/a&gt; in 1946, Carless made his final first-class appearance, 12 years after his previous first-class match, in a Glamorgan side which was beset by injuries and struggling to field a team. His final first-class match was against &lt;a href=\"Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;. In his 3 matches he scored 35 runs at a &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28cricket%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; of 11.66 and a high score of 25.\nIn 1947, Carless joined &lt;a href=\"Devon%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt;, where he made his &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Counties%20Championship\"&gt;Minor Counties Championship&lt;/a&gt; debut for the county against &lt;a href=\"Cornwall%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;. From 1947 to 1949, he represented Devon in 7 Minor Counties fixtures, with his final appearance for the county coming against the Glamorgan Second XI.\nA multi-talented sportsman, Carless played &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"inside%20forward\"&gt;inside forward&lt;/a&gt;. He began his career at &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;, but did not make a first team appearance, and then returned to Wales to play for &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Barry Town&lt;/a&gt;. Carless made his &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; debut in 1932 with &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Cardiff City&lt;/a&gt; and spent several years there without establishing himself in the first team. He went on to play for &lt;a href=\"Altrincham%20F.C.\"&gt;Altrincham&lt;/a&gt; and return to Barry Town before the Second World War. Carless joined &lt;a href=\"Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.\"&gt;Plymouth Argyle&lt;/a&gt; in 1946, playing 11 games as a guest in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20South\"&gt;Football League South&lt;/a&gt; and then signing up to make four &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; appearances when the full league programme returned.\nIn 1947, soon after his last appearance for Argyle, Carless accepted an offer to become the club's head groundsman, having gained experience doing the job for Cardiff City before moving to &lt;a href=\"Plymouth\"&gt;Plymouth&lt;/a&gt;. The role enabled him to continue his cricket career with Devon.\nCarless died at &lt;a href=\"Barry%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan\"&gt;Barry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glamorgan\"&gt;Glamorgan&lt;/a&gt; on 26 September 1987."
