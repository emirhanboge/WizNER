    "text": "TAK-4 &lt;a href=\"independent%20suspension\"&gt;independent suspension&lt;/a&gt; system is a family of independent suspension systems designed and manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Oshkosh%20Corporation\"&gt;Oshkosh Corporation&lt;/a&gt; for use on military, severe-duty and &lt;a href=\"emergency%20vehicle\"&gt;emergency vehicle&lt;/a&gt;s. The system was developed from the mid-1990s.\nIn addition to third party usage for &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Army\"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;Marines&lt;/a&gt; Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (&lt;a href=\"MRAP\"&gt;MRAP&lt;/a&gt;) fleet upgrades, TAK-4 independent suspension system is fitted by Oshkosh to a variety of its military vehicles and by its business unit, Oshkosh Airport Products, to its &lt;a href=\"Oshkosh%20Striker\"&gt;Striker&lt;/a&gt; Airport Rescue vehicle and &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Manufacturing\"&gt;Pierce Manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href=\"Aircraft%20rescue%20and%20firefighting\"&gt;Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting&lt;/a&gt; (ARFF) trucks and other appliances.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1999 Oshkosh was awarded a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (USAF) contract to supply P23 ARFF trucks. These, and the earlier P23 supplied to the Air Force between 1994 and 1996 by &lt;a href=\"Teledyne%20Technologies\"&gt;Teledyne&lt;/a&gt; and Emergency-One (E-One) were fitted with independent suspension designed by &lt;a href=\"Timoney%20Technology%20Limited%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Timoney Technology of Ireland.&lt;/a&gt;\nThe success of the P23, and subsequent interest in an independent suspension solution for US Army and Marines 5-ton truck upgrade projects led to Oshkosh (and the then &lt;a href=\"Rockwell%20International\"&gt;Rockwell&lt;/a&gt;) approaching Timoney with regard to a licence arrangement for the suspension. Following discussions with both, Timoney opted to enter into a licence arrangement with Rockwell (now &lt;a href=\"Meritor\"&gt;Meritor&lt;/a&gt;).\nOshkosh then developed two, possibly three independent suspension systems, including the set-up that came to be marketed as TAK-4 independent suspension system.\nThe first use of TAK-4 independent suspension system was on an M939 5-ton truck as part of the Marines\u2019 plan to upgrade its &lt;a href=\"M939%20Truck\"&gt;M939&lt;/a&gt; fleet. The &lt;a href=\"upgrade\"&gt;upgrade&lt;/a&gt; approach was ultimately abandoned, this replaced by a new-build approach for which the Oshkosh &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Tactical%20Vehicle%20Replacement\"&gt;Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement&lt;/a&gt; (MTVR) was selected.\nThe first production contract for the MTVR was awarded in February 1999 and the type remains in production for the US Marines. The MTVR is fitted with TAK-4 independent suspension system independent suspension and was the first mass-produced military truck with fully independent suspension. \nOshkosh has since fitted TAK-4 independent suspension system to its &lt;a href=\"Palletized%20Load%20System\"&gt;Palletized Load System&lt;/a&gt; (PLS) trucks, &lt;a href=\"Oshkosh%20Logistic%20Vehicle%20System%20Replacement%20%28LVSR%29\"&gt;Logistic Vehicle System Replacement&lt;/a&gt; (LVSR) trucks and &lt;a href=\"Oshkosh%20M-ATV\"&gt;M-ATVs&lt;/a&gt; (MRAP \u2013 All-Terrain Vehicle), and the system has been retro-fitted to US Army/Marines General Dynamics/Force Protection &lt;a href=\"Cougar%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Cougar&lt;/a&gt; MRAPs, BAE Systems\u2019 &lt;a href=\"RG-31%20Nyala\"&gt;RG-31&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RG-33\"&gt;RG-33&lt;/a&gt; MRAPs. Oshkosh business units Pierce Manufacturing and Oshkosh Airport Products fit TAK-4 independent suspension system systems to a large amount of its &lt;a href=\"Fire%20engine\"&gt;fire trucks.&lt;/a&gt;\nMost recently the latest TAK-4i intelligent independent suspension system has been fitted to Oshkosh's &lt;a href=\"L-ATV\"&gt;L-ATV&lt;/a&gt; (Light Combat Tactical \u2013 All-Terrain Vehicle), this selected to meet the US Army and Marines &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Light%20Tactical%20Vehicle\"&gt;JLTV&lt;/a&gt; (Joint Light Tactical Vehicle) requirement.\nOshkosh remains current market leader for independent suspension systems above the 5000\u00a0kg threshold for where commercial systems are often used, and excluding Striker and Pierce products has equipped in the region of 30,000 military vehicles with the TAK-4 independent suspension system set-up. This figure will increase as JLTV production ramps up.\nTo date the TAK-4 independent suspension system has accrued in excess of 1,000,000 actual durability test miles, most of these in extreme conditions.\nDescription.\nThe Oshkosh TAK-4 (and TAK-4i) suspension is known as &lt;a href=\"Double%20wishbone%20suspension\"&gt;double wishbone independent suspension.&lt;/a&gt; This is an independent suspension design using two wishbone-shaped arms to locate the wheel. Each arm has two mounting points to the &lt;a href=\"subframe\"&gt;subframe&lt;/a&gt; and one joint at the &lt;a href=\"Knuckle%20joint%20%28mechanical%29\"&gt;knuckle&lt;/a&gt;, and in the case of TAK-4 independent suspension system these arms are of unequal length. The &lt;a href=\"shock%20absorber\"&gt;shock absorber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coil%20spring\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; mount to the lower arm to control vertical movement. The double-wishbone suspension can also be referred to as \u2018double A-arm,\u2019 though the arms themselves can be A-shaped, L-shaped, or even a single bar linkage. The complete TAK-4 independent suspension system set-up also includes a subframe which contains the axle &lt;a href=\"Differential%20%28mechanical%20device%29\"&gt;differential&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"half%20shaft\"&gt;half shaft&lt;/a&gt;s, and wheel ends with steering attachments and &lt;a href=\"brakes\"&gt;brakes&lt;/a&gt;.\nTAK-4 independent suspension system accepts various spring mediums, but the vast majority of systems supplied by Oshkosh to date have been fitted with coil springs. Exceptions are the rear axles on the LVSR and the wrecker variant of the MTVR which are hydro-pneumatic struts with Hendrickson components.\nThe original TAK-4 independent suspension system &lt;a href=\"coil%20spring\"&gt;coil spring&lt;/a&gt; set-up as fitted to MTVR, LVSR and PLS A1 (front axles), M-ATV and upgraded MRAPs offers around 16-inches of vertical wheel travel and for MTVR, LVSR and PLS-A1, and has an off-road &lt;a href=\"gross%20vehicle%20weight%20rating\"&gt;gross vehicle weight rating&lt;/a&gt; (GVWR) of 12,020\u00a0kg. The slighter lighter-capacity version fitted to the M-ATV has an off-road GVWR of 10,433\u00a0kg. The light version offered as a potential &lt;a href=\"Humvee\"&gt;HMMWV&lt;/a&gt; upgrade has a GVWR of 10,000\u00a0kg and offers around 14-inches of vertical wheel travel. In all cases the operating profile of the system is 70% off-road, 30% on-road.\nThe new Oshkosh TAK-4i intelligent independent suspension system suspension provides 20-inches of wheel travel, and again a 70% off-road, 30% on-road operating profile. TAK-4i intelligent independent suspension system suspension is fitted to Oshkosh's JLTV/L-ATV. TAK-4i intelligent independent suspension system suspension is an \u2018intelligent\u2019 independent suspension, providing variable ride height through gas springs.\nTo promote TAK-4i intelligent independent suspension system suspension, Oshkosh has stated the following: \u201cIn fact, Independent testing proves that the Oshkosh L-ATV provides the same ride quality at speeds 70 percent faster than today\u2019s industry gold standard for off-road mobility, the Oshkosh MRAP All-Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV).\u201d"
