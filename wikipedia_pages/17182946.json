He also played for the &lt;a href=\"Hull%20Kingston%20Rovers\"&gt;Hull Kingston Rovers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Totalisator%20Agency%20Board\"&gt;Totalisator Agency Board&lt;/a&gt; (TAB) announced that 95 per cent of bets placed on the first scoring play of this match were for the unusual option of a Cowboys penalty goal. Friends and associates of Tandy placed a large number of bets, with the total windfall for a successful bet expected to be over $100,000. Tandy was then responsible for two actions in the match to allow the opposing side to score a penalty goal inside the first two minutes: first by giving away possession to the Cowboys in the opening moments of the match by knocking on, and then giving away a penalty in the play-the-ball ten metres in front of the goal posts. These actions put the Cowboys in a position where a penalty goal was a likely outcome; but they decided on an attacking option and scored a try instead.\nTandy denied the accusations of deliberately giving away possession and a penalty to allow the exotic option on the bets to be successful. Despite this, he was arrested on 2 February 2011 for providing false evidence to a law enforcement agency during the investigation of the betting scandal. Tandy was in more than $70,000 debt at the time of the match, owing to losses from his own long-standing gambling addiction.\nOn 6 October 2011, Tandy was found to be guilty of manipulating the first scoring point of the game. He received an intensive correction order for six months. It required: community service, supervision and curfew, but he could have been jailed for two years. He appealed the charge in January 2014 but lost the case. Tandy received a lifetime ban from NRL rugby league over the &lt;a href=\"spot%20fixing\"&gt;spot fixing&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater life and death.\nIn January 2014, Tandy was arrested and charged with kidnapping in connection with the recovery of a drug debt from the victim, police alleging that Tandy was serving as a standover man. Three months after being bailed, Tandy was found dead at his parents' home in &lt;a href=\"Saratoga%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Saratoga, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, following what is believed to have been an accidental overdose of prescription drugs."
