It became known as the Deutsches Derby in 1889.\nFor most of its history the race has been held at Hamburg. It has also been staged at &lt;a href=\"Grunewald\"&gt;Grunewald&lt;/a&gt; (1919), &lt;a href=\"Hoppegarten\"&gt;Hoppegarten&lt;/a&gt; (1943\u201344), &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; (1946) and &lt;a href=\"Cologne-Weidenpesch%20Racecourse\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt; (1947). It was titled the Grosser Deutschlandpreis der Dreij\u00e4hrigen during World War II.\nThe present system of race grading was introduced in Germany in 1972, and the Deutsches Derby was given Group 1 status.\nThe race was sponsored by &lt;a href=\"BMW\"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; from 1991 to 2008. It was backed by IDEE Kaffee from 2009 to 2011 and &lt;a href=\"Sparda-Bank\"&gt;Sparda-Bank&lt;/a&gt; from 2012 to 2014 before IDEE returned as sponsors from 2015.\nRecords.\nLeading &lt;a href=\"jockey\"&gt;jockey&lt;/a&gt; (8 wins):\nLeading &lt;a href=\"Horse%20trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; (9 wins):\nLeading owner (19 wins):\nWinners since 1965.\n Taishan finished first in 1989, but he was relegated to second place following a stewards' inquiry.\nEarlier winners.\n1 Primas finished first in 1872, but he was disqualified. Hymenaeus tied with Seemann, but he was awarded victory by the drawing of lots.2 The 1875, 1882 and 1893 races were dead-heats and have joint winners."
