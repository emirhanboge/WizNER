    "title": "Checkmate (Sydney Horler novel)",
    "text": "Checkmate (&lt;a href=\"1930%20in%20literature\"&gt;1930&lt;/a&gt;) is one of the many popular novels written by &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;Englishman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Horler\"&gt;Sydney Horler&lt;/a&gt; in the first half of the 20th century. Forgotten today, the book describes the exciting lifestyle of the wealthy social elite. \"Checkmate\" adds an element of &lt;a href=\"crime%20fiction\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adventure\"&gt;adventure&lt;/a&gt; to that atmosphere, but the countless &lt;a href=\"coincidence\"&gt;coincidence&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the plot guarantee a thoroughly predictable &lt;a href=\"happy%20ending\"&gt;happy ending&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a double wedding.\nPlot introduction.\nThe novel is about a gang of four international criminals who hire a young and na\u00efve English girl as an innocent &lt;a href=\"decoy\"&gt;decoy&lt;/a&gt; in a scheme to rid an English aristocrat of her family jewels.\nPlot summary.\nThe innocent girl is 24-year-old Mary Mallory, who has spent the last seven years in isolation caring for her invalid aunt. After the latter's death, Mary, now living in London, realizes that she has to earn her own money unless she wants to live in relative &lt;a href=\"poverty\"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt;. She answers the &lt;a href=\"Advertising\"&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt; of a Comtesse Zamoyski, who is looking for a companion with whom to travel to the &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B4te%20d%27Azur\"&gt;C\u00f4te d'Azur&lt;/a&gt;, and, after an interview, she is accepted for the post. As Mary sees it, her new job combines at least two advantages: seeing the world and proving, to herself as well as her friends, that she is an independent woman. Mary's blinkered view lets her ignore all the warning signs that are pointed out to her. Jessie Stevens, her old schoolmate, even suspects that \"&lt;a href=\"sexual%20slavery\"&gt;White Slavery&lt;/a&gt;\" could be behind that ad, but Mary does not listen and leaves London with her new employer.\nThrough a series of coincidences a number of people are alerted to the dangers that might be in store for Mary. Apart from Jessie Stevens, it is Dick Delabrae, a &lt;a href=\"columnist\"&gt;society columnist&lt;/a&gt; for \"The Sun\", and his friend Robert Wingate, who happens to be the nephew of Lady Wentworth, whose &lt;a href=\"pearl\"&gt;pearl&lt;/a&gt;s the gang wants to steal. They all come to &lt;a href=\"Cannes\"&gt;Cannes&lt;/a&gt;, where the Comtesse Zamoyski and Mary Mallory are staying in a remote &lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt;, in order to help the young woman and prevent the theft of the pearls.\nThe Comtesse turns out to be rather moody, but at first Mary has no idea that she is associating with criminals. Her first visit to the &lt;a href=\"Casino\"&gt;Casino&lt;/a&gt; is a huge success: Not only does she win more than \u00a31,500 at &lt;a href=\"baccarat\"&gt;baccarat&lt;/a&gt; but she also makes the acquaintance of Lady Wentworth, who immediately takes a liking to the charming girl. Later that night, however, back at the villa, she overhears a conversation between the Comtesse, Jos\u00e9 Santes, allegedly the Comtesse's nephew, and a young Russian called Nadja, allegedly her &lt;a href=\"maid\"&gt;maid&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it unmistakably clear to her that she is staying under the same roof with criminals.\nHowever, escape is now no longer possible. Before she can get away from the villa, Mary Mallory is captured, drugged and &lt;a href=\"hypnosis\"&gt;hypnotized&lt;/a&gt; by the fourth member of the gang, a &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;Frenchman&lt;/a&gt; posing as a doctor. On his way to the villa to rescue Mary, Robert Wingate, who has fallen in love with Mary, is &lt;a href=\"kidnapping\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; by Santes's men and thrown into &lt;a href=\"catacomb\"&gt;catacomb&lt;/a&gt;s somewhere below the streets of Cannes. Lady Wentworth is lured to the Comtesse's villa with the prospect of seeing Mary again but after her arrival she is tied to a chair and, in a drug-induced frenzy, stabbed to death by Jos\u00e9 Santes, a \"dope fiend\". As she is not wearing her pearls, the gang flee without any loot. When Mary Mallory wakes from her stupor some time later it is only to encounter the French &lt;a href=\"police\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; accusing her of murdering Lady Wentworth, whose body she discovers in the same room where she was lying unconscious.\nBut Robert Wingate can escape from the dungeon, and all misunderstandings are cleared up in the end. The members of the gang are &lt;a href=\"arrest\"&gt;arrest&lt;/a&gt;ed near the Italian border, and the two couples \u2014 Dick and Jessie on the one hand, Robert and Mary on the other \u2014 return to England to get married.\nMajor themes.\nIn \"Checkmate\" it is described how railway passengers, before boarding their train, would grab the latest novel from the bookstall at &lt;a href=\"London%20Victoria%20station\"&gt;Victoria Station&lt;/a&gt; in order to be able to indulge in some light reading during their journey. \"Checkmate\" itself would have been such a novel: sensational, thrilling \u2014 a variation of the old \"&lt;a href=\"damsel%20in%20distress\"&gt;damsel in distress&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"motif%20%28literature%29\"&gt;motif&lt;/a&gt; \u2014, romantic, sexy, with characters larger than life, with many complications during the plot but a clear-cut ending where &lt;a href=\"goodness%20and%20value%20theory\"&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"virtue\"&gt;virtuous&lt;/a&gt; behavior is rewarded and &lt;a href=\"evil\"&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt; is punished.\nYoung women, it seems, are placed into three categories according to their knowledge of the world: Women like Nadja, who have seen and done it all, clearly belong to the \"wrong 'un\" type; the same would be true of the so-called Comtesse in her younger days (\"a woman with a history [\u2026] and a past\"). Girls such as Jessie Stevens, on the other hand, know what is going on and enjoy life to the full but never do anything illegal or immoral, which implies that they do not indulge in &lt;a href=\"pre-marital%20sex\"&gt;pre-marital sex&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"recreational%20drug\"&gt;recreational drug&lt;/a&gt;s. Finally, there are young women like Mary Mallory, who is described as \"absolutely a child, so far as the world is concerned\" and so gullible she will believe almost anything she is told.\nIn a world full of double standards of &lt;a href=\"morality\"&gt;morality&lt;/a&gt;, men are conceded a greater amount of freedom. Robert Wingate, for example,\npossessed about the usual number of faults and &lt;a href=\"virtue\"&gt;virtue&lt;/a&gt;s of his type. Whilst certainly not a &lt;a href=\"hypocrisy\"&gt;prig&lt;/a&gt;, he could not with justice have been placed in the &lt;a href=\"saint\"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt;ly category. He enjoyed life to the full, but he had a certain &lt;a href=\"code%20of%20honor\"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; to which he adhered. Briefly, it was this: he was always prepared to be amused by a girl who was \"goey\", provided she was sufficiently attractive, but no girl of the stricter class had ever had cause to regret getting to know Bobby Wingate. There were certain unwritten rules in the game, and this was one of them. Unlike so many of his contemporaries, he barred married women \u2014 which is to say he respected them even when they didn't respect themselves. One day \u2014 if ever he did get married \u2014 he would be able to look into his wife's eyes without undue shame, which is as much as any man, born of woman, can hope to do. (Chapter IV)\nThe people who have time and money enough to travel to the C\u00f4te d'Azur are seen in rather an unfavorable light. At one point in the novel Robert Wingate explains to Mary Mallory that, \"apart from the millionaires, the &lt;a href=\"courtesan\"&gt;courtesan&lt;/a&gt;s, the crooks, and the gamblers\", the majority of visitors to Cannes are \"\"\u00e9migr\u00e9s\" and \"hivernants\" \u2014 people who leave England in order to escape paying taxes, and who are able to make a better show financially than they would in their own country\" (Chapter XII). However, honest members of the British &lt;a href=\"upper%20class\"&gt;upper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"upper%20middle%20class\"&gt;upper middle class&lt;/a&gt;es such as Delabrae and Jessie Stevens also mingle with that crowd.\n&lt;a href=\"wikt%3AProgress\"&gt;Progress&lt;/a&gt; is one of the magic words with that particular set of people, with progress in &lt;a href=\"aviation\"&gt;aviation&lt;/a&gt; being especially appealing. The members of the &lt;a href=\"jet%20set\"&gt;jet set&lt;/a&gt; appreciate the fact that there are scheduled flights now not only from &lt;a href=\"Croydon%20Airport\"&gt;Croydon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Le%20Bourget\"&gt;Le Bourget&lt;/a&gt; but also from Paris to Cannes. When Dick Delabrae and Jessie Stevens decide to join Mary in Cannes, they consider the various means of transport available to them:\n\"How do we go? &lt;a href=\"Le%20Train%20Bleu\"&gt;Blue train&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Nothing so prosaic! By air \u2014 the only possible way nowadays. You're provincial, my child.\"\n\"Provincial be damned!\" was the quick retort; \"I have only one neck and I want to keep it intact!\"\nDelabrae laughed at the suggestion of any danger.
