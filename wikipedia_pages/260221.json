    "text": "St. Albans is the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20County%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Franklin County, Vermont&lt;/a&gt;, United States. At the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%2C%202020\"&gt;2020 census&lt;/a&gt;, the city population was 6,877. St. Albans City is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"St.%20Albans%20%28town%29%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;the town of Saint Albans&lt;/a&gt; which is incorporated separately from the city of St. Albans. The city is located in Northwestern Vermont in Franklin County. It lies 29 miles north of &lt;a href=\"Burlington%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Burlington&lt;/a&gt;, the state's most populous city which is located in &lt;a href=\"Chittenden%20County%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Chittenden County&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOne of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire%20grants\"&gt;New Hampshire grants&lt;/a&gt;, St. Albans was chartered by Colonial Governor &lt;a href=\"Benning%20Wentworth\"&gt;Benning Wentworth&lt;/a&gt; on August 17, 1763, to Stephen Pomeroy and 63 others. Named after &lt;a href=\"St%20Albans\"&gt;St Albans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hertfordshire\"&gt;Hertfordshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, it was first settled during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolution\"&gt;Revolution&lt;/a&gt; by Jesse Welden. The war delayed further settlement until 1785, when many others began to arrive. Farmers found the rich, dark &lt;a href=\"loam\"&gt;loam&lt;/a&gt; suitable for &lt;a href=\"Tillage\"&gt;cultivation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as for the raising of &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Butter\"&gt;Butter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt; were produced in great quantities. St. Albans also became known as \"Railroad City,\" home to a major &lt;a href=\"train%20station\"&gt;depot&lt;/a&gt;, operations center and repair shop of the &lt;a href=\"Vermont%20and%20Canada%20Railroad\"&gt;Vermont and Canada Railroad&lt;/a&gt;. When the village was incorporated in 1859, it had an &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt;, a manufacturer of &lt;a href=\"freight%20car\"&gt;freight car&lt;/a&gt;s, and a large number of &lt;a href=\"mechanic\"&gt;mechanic&lt;/a&gt; shops.\nThe northernmost engagement of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Albans%20Raid\"&gt;St. Albans Raid&lt;/a&gt;, occurred here on October 19, 1864. In 1902, the City of St. Albans was incorporated, comprising two square miles (518 hectares) within the town of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Albans%20%28town%29%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;St. Albans&lt;/a&gt;. Today it is a &lt;a href=\"tourist%20destination\"&gt;tourist destination&lt;/a&gt; noted for its &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20architecture\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"American%20Craftsman\"&gt;Craftsman&lt;/a&gt; style &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt; built during the railroad era, when over 200 trains a day passed through. St. Albans is a research target for &lt;a href=\"genealogy\"&gt;genealogists&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;a href=\"immigrant\"&gt;immigrant&lt;/a&gt;s heading for the United States would sometimes land in Canada at &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Halifax\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Montreal%2C%20Quebec\"&gt;Montreal, Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, then take a train through the border crossing here.
