    "text": "Osu Castle (also known as Fort Christiansborg or the Castle) is a castle located in &lt;a href=\"Osu%2C%20Accra\"&gt;Osu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghana\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; on the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Guinea\"&gt;Gulf of Guinea&lt;/a&gt; in Africa. \nA substantial &lt;a href=\"fort\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt; was built by &lt;a href=\"Denmark-Norway\"&gt;Denmark-Norway&lt;/a&gt; in the 1660s, thereafter the fort changed ownership between Denmark-Norway, &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Akwamu\"&gt;Akwamu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, and finally post-Independence &lt;a href=\"Ghana\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;. Under Denmark\u2013Norway control it was the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Danish%20Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Danish Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, and held and dispatched enslaved people overseas.\nIn 1902, Osu Castle became the &lt;a href=\"seat%20of%20government\"&gt;seat of government&lt;/a&gt; in Ghana but this has now moved to &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Jubilee%20House\"&gt;Golden Jubilee House&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe area was first occupied in 1550 by the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Empire\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, though in the 17th century Portuguese influence diminished. The area came under the control of &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Empire\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; in the 1650s, led by the German trader &lt;a href=\"Hendrik%20Carloff\"&gt;Heinrich Carloff&lt;/a&gt;. In 1652, he was given permission to build a small fortified lodge by the King of Accra, with whom he had previously done business. In 1660, control passed to the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Empire\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; but it was soon lost to &lt;a href=\"Denmark-Norway\"&gt;Denmark-Norway&lt;/a&gt;. In 1657, Carloff had again traveled to &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, this time representing Denmark-Norway. He aimed to conquer the forts he had previously established, which he found easy at Osu. In its early life, the castle was primarily used in the &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ivory%20trade\"&gt;ivory trade&lt;/a&gt;, but under Dano-Norwegian control it increasingly dealt with &lt;a href=\"African%20slave%20trade\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt;.\nOsu Castle was located close to two other forts. &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Cr%C3%A8vecoeur%20%28Ghana%29\"&gt;Fort Cr\u00e8vec\u0153ur&lt;/a&gt; was controlled by the Dutch and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20James%20%28Ghana%29\"&gt;Fort James&lt;/a&gt; by the British. The settlement at Osu was too small to store sufficient goods to compete with the others. Consequently, Denmark-Norway purchased adjoining land and expanded the building, naming it Fort Christiansborg after the reigning Danish King &lt;a href=\"Christian%20V%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Christian V&lt;/a&gt;. This is not to be confused with the slightly later &lt;a href=\"Christiansborg%20Palace%20%281st%29\"&gt;royal palace in Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;. Denmark-Norway would occupy the fort for most of the next 200 years, with some interruptions, and for much of that time it served as the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Danish%20Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast of Denmark-Norway&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1679 or 1680, the fort's &lt;a href=\"Greeks\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; assistant commander incited a &lt;a href=\"mutiny\"&gt;mutiny&lt;/a&gt; to murder the commander. Shortly after that, a Portuguese ship commanded by Juli\u00e3o de Campos Barreto visited the fort and agreed to purchase it. The fort was named Fort &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Xavier\"&gt;S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; missionary &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Xavier\"&gt;Francis Xavier&lt;/a&gt;. The Portuguese built a &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; and raised the &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt;s by three feet. The fort was abandoned on 29 August 1682 after the &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; mutinied and it became clear that &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20people\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; traders could not compete with the other Gold Coast powers. Danish forces returned in February 1683 after purchasing the fort back from the Portuguese. In 1685, Fort Christiansborg became the capital of the Gold Coast of Denmark-Norway, taking over from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frederiksborg\"&gt;Fort Frederiksborg&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Akwamu\"&gt;Akwamu&lt;/a&gt; ethnic group occupied the fort in 1693 after overpowering the occupants (who were reduced by death and disease) while disguised as merchants. Assameni, the Akwamu leader, occupied the fort for a year, trading with merchants from many nations. In 1694, Assameni sold the fort back to Denmark-Norway for 50 &lt;a href=\"mark%20%28weight%29\"&gt;marks&lt;/a&gt; of gold (400 troy ounces, worth \u00a3200,000 to \u00a3250,000 in 2008) but retained the keys, which are still in the ethnic group's possession to this day. The early 18th century was not kind to the fort, and in 1722 the English reported it to be in disrepair. Extensions were made later that century, however, and structural improvements were made in 1824. The additional store rooms, garrison quarters, platforms, bastions and houses resulted in the castle being four times the size of the original fort. In the 1770s, the Danes at Osu became involved in a conflict with Dutch-controlled Accra.\nIn 1850, the British bought all of Denmark's &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28British%20colony%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; possessions for &lt;a href=\"pound%20sterling\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;10,000 (between \u00a3850,000 and \u00a31.5m in 2007), including Fort Christiansborg. Denmark had been considering selling these outposts for some time. After the slave trade had been &lt;a href=\"abolitionism\"&gt;abolished&lt;/a&gt; they were expensive to run and brought little benefit. &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; experienced the same problems, but was keen to prevent illegal slave trading and &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empires\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; strengthening in the area. An earthquake in 1862 destroyed most of the upper floors, which were rebuilt in wood. Later that century, the castle became the seat of the colonial government. It was abandoned by the British colonial powers from 1890 to 1901. Within this period, it was used as a constabulary mess and later a &lt;a href=\"psychiatric%20asylum\"&gt;psychiatric asylum&lt;/a&gt;. It became the seat of government again in 1902. In 1950, the wooden upper floors were rebuilt according to the original Danish plans. In 1957, when Ghana became independent, with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; as head of state, the fort became Government House, the residence of the &lt;a href=\"Governor-General\"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt;. When Ghana became a &lt;a href=\"republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt; in 1960, it became the residence of Ghana's first president, &lt;a href=\"Kwame%20Nkrumah\"&gt;Kwame Nkrumah&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2005, there was debate over whether Osu Castle should be replaced as the seat of government. President &lt;a href=\"John%20Kufuor\"&gt;John Kufuor&lt;/a&gt; argued that his government should not sit at the castle due to its previous association with slavery and also because its facilities were inadequate. &lt;a href=\"National%20Democratic%20Congress%20%28Ghana%29\"&gt;National Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt; MPs, however, argued that the $50\u00a0m that a new presidential palace would cost would be better spent elsewhere.\nFeatures.\nOsu Castle is no longer the seat of government. The seat of government is now the &lt;a href=\"Jubilee%20House\"&gt;Jubilee House&lt;/a&gt;. This name is now gazetted after being changed from its former name, &lt;a href=\"The%20Flagstaff%20House\"&gt;The Flagstaff House&lt;/a&gt;. Many international dignitaries have visited the castle while in the region, including U.S. Presidents &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; and German Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Gerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der\"&gt;Gerhard Schr\u00f6der&lt;/a&gt;. Additional rooms were built in order to accommodate &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;'s visit in 1961, one year after Ghana became a republic.\nThe present castle is made up of various extensions to the original and is thus in an unorthodox shape. It has many facilities for the use of employees, including a clinic, caf\u00e9, shopping centre and a post office. It also still accommodates a permanent garrison. The extensive gardens feature a wide variety of plants, both local and imported, and employ 30 people. They are used for the president's outdoor receptions and parties. The Castle is closed to walk-in visitors.\nControversies.\nIn 2007, the opposition &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20parliament\"&gt;Ministers of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (MPs) in &lt;a href=\"Ghana\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"National%20Democratic%20Congress%20%28Ghana%29\"&gt;National Democratic Congress, NDC&lt;/a&gt;) stormed out of a parliamentary debate on whether to take out a $50m loan to build a new presidential palace. MPs from &lt;a href=\"President%20%28government%20title%29\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Agyekum%20Kufuor\"&gt;John Agyekum Kufuor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"New%20Patriotic%20Party\"&gt;New Patriotic Party&lt;/a&gt; voted unanimously in favour of taking the loan from &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. They argued that the president should not be based in Osu Castle, where slaves used to be kept. \nThe opposition &lt;a href=\"National%20Democratic%20Congress%20%28Ghana%29\"&gt;National Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt; said the money would be better spent such as improving the &lt;a href=\"economy\"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt; and helping promote the &lt;a href=\"Better%20Ghana%20Agenda\"&gt;Better Ghana Agenda&lt;/a&gt;. This led to the then general secretary to the opposition &lt;a href=\"National%20Democratic%20Congress%20%28Ghana%29\"&gt;NDC&lt;/a&gt; to describe the new &lt;a href=\"Jubilee%20House\"&gt;Flagstaff House&lt;/a&gt; as a \"hen coop only fit for rearing chicken\". The old &lt;a href=\"The%20Flagstaff%20House\"&gt;Flagstaff House&lt;/a&gt; used by Ghana's first president as his residence is being renovated into a museum, with the grounds on which it stands being built up as an ultra-modern office complex and residence for the president and vice-president of Ghana as well as their staff."
