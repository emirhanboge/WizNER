    "title": "Zygmunt Mycielski",
    "text": "Count Zygmunt Mycielski (17 August 1907 \u2013 5 August 1987) was a Polish &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"music%20critic\"&gt;music critic&lt;/a&gt;. He was born in &lt;a href=\"Przeworsk\"&gt;Przeworsk&lt;/a&gt; and completed his childhood education in &lt;a href=\"Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, where he was taught by &lt;a href=\"Bernardino%20Rizzi\"&gt;Bernardino Rizzi&lt;/a&gt;. In 1928, Mycielski moved to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, where he studied composition at &lt;a href=\"%C3%89cole%20Normale%20de%20Musique\"&gt;\u00c9cole Normale de Musique&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Dukas\"&gt;Paul Dukas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nadia%20Boulanger\"&gt;Nadia Boulanger&lt;/a&gt;. While there, he served as president of the Association of Young Polish Musicians in Paris from 1934 to 1936. In 1936, he moved back to Poland and began his music and writing career.\nMycielski served in the Polish military during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and became a &lt;a href=\"prisoner%20of%20war\"&gt;prisoner of war&lt;/a&gt; after being captured by the &lt;a href=\"German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29\"&gt;German Army&lt;/a&gt;. For the rest of the war, he did compulsory work for a German farmer. After the war ended, he returned to Poland and served two terms as editor for \"&lt;a href=\"Ruch%20Muzyczny\"&gt;Ruch Muzyczny&lt;/a&gt;\" (1946\u20131948 and 1957\u20131959) before becoming editor-in-chief from 1960 to 1968. His political views clashed with &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; Polish authorities, however. His publications caused him to be ousted as editor-in-chief of \"Ruch Muzyczny\"; his writings were then subject to strict censorship and he was forbidden to leave the country.\nMycielski continued his political activism though. In 1975, he signed a group letter with other Polish intellectuals protesting proposed changes to the Polish constitution by the Communist party. In 1978, he founded the Academic Education Society, a student organisation that was deemed illegal and later banned.\nMycielski died in &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; and he was buried in &lt;a href=\"Wi%C5%9Bniowa%2C%20Strzy%C5%BC%C3%B3w%20County\"&gt;Wi\u015bniowa&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82ok%20River\"&gt;Wis\u0142ok River&lt;/a&gt;."
