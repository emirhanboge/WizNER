    "text": "John Theodore Salveson (January 5, 1914 \u2013 December 28, 1974) was a &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; who played for five seasons. He played for the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; from 1933 to 1934, the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; in 1935, and the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; in 1943 and 1945.\nSalveson had a long and successful minor league career, spanning 22 years. From 1936 to 1942 and 1946 to 1953 he pitched in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League\"&gt;Pacific Coast League&lt;/a&gt;, where he won 204 games. In 1942, he won 24 games with the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Oaks%20%28PCL%29\"&gt;Oakland Oaks&lt;/a&gt;, enough to earn him a shot at the majors for the first time in eight years.\nDuring his career, Salveson was known for his efficiency, once pitching a full game in just one hour, twenty minutes, and another time completed a game with just 54 pitches. Long-time PCL star &lt;a href=\"Lefty%20O%27Doul\"&gt;Lefty O'Doul&lt;/a&gt; dubbed him \"the great conservationist\".\nHe was a good hitting pitcher in his brief major league career. He posted a .260 &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; (20-for-77) with 8 &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt;, 5 &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubles&lt;/a&gt;, 3 &lt;a href=\"home%20runs\"&gt;home runs&lt;/a&gt; and 10 &lt;a href=\"RBI\"&gt;RBI&lt;/a&gt;. He recorded a .976 &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt; with only two errors in 83 &lt;a href=\"total%20chances\"&gt;total chances&lt;/a&gt;.\nSalveson also appeared in the movie \"&lt;a href=\"Pride%20of%20the%20Yankees\"&gt;Pride of the Yankees&lt;/a&gt;\", in which he played a pitcher who hit &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Gehrig\"&gt;Lou Gehrig&lt;/a&gt; (played by &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Cooper\"&gt;Gary Cooper&lt;/a&gt;) in the head with a pitch."
