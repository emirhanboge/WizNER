    "text": "Maidstone Grammar School (MGS) is a &lt;a href=\"grammar%20school\"&gt;grammar school&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maidstone\"&gt;Maidstone&lt;/a&gt;, England. The school was founded in 1549 after &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Somerset\"&gt;Protector Somerset&lt;/a&gt; sold Corpus Christi Hall on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Edward%20VI%20of%20England\"&gt;King Edward VI&lt;/a&gt; to the people of &lt;a href=\"Maidstone\"&gt;Maidstone&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a3200. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20charter\"&gt;Royal Charter&lt;/a&gt; for establishment of a &lt;a href=\"grammar%20school\"&gt;grammar school&lt;/a&gt; was also granted at this time.\nAdmissions.\nMaidstone Grammar School is a &lt;a href=\"selective%20school\"&gt;selective school&lt;/a&gt;, taking boys at the age of 11 and over based on their &lt;a href=\"Eleven-plus\"&gt;11+ results&lt;/a&gt;, and also admits male and female pupils at 16+ based on their &lt;a href=\"GCSE\"&gt;GCSE&lt;/a&gt; results. Current admissions into &lt;a href=\"Sixth%20Form\"&gt;Sixth Form&lt;/a&gt; are at a 5.5 average GCSE grade. \nThe school currently has 1292 pupils and 112 members of staff, with 69 teachers as of the academic year 2018\u20132019.\nBuildings.\nThe main school building surrounds a &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20period\"&gt;Tudor-style&lt;/a&gt; quadrangle with a &lt;a href=\"cloister\"&gt;cloister&lt;/a&gt; on one side. Two new blocks were added in the 1960s and 80s to complete a second quadrangle, nicknamed the 'Court'. In 2005, a new &lt;a href=\"refectory\"&gt;refectory&lt;/a&gt; and teaching block (renamed the 'Walker Building') opened, followed by 'Applied Learning' and Sixth Form buildings in 2011.\nAdditional funding from &lt;a href=\"Kent%20County%20Council\"&gt;Kent County Council&lt;/a&gt; allowed the school to open a designated Performing Arts building, new sports pavilion, and computing and science block between 2017 and 2019. The pavilion was constructed to replace the traditional pavilion which had fallen into disrepair. More recently, the school opened a refurbishment of the War Memorial Library and an all-weather sports pitch.\nHouses.\nA house system was inaugurated in 1899 with three houses of 'School', 'East Borough' and 'West Borough'; allocation was based on local geography. In September 2007, the school reformed the tradition with the introduction of six new school houses named after military vehicles: &lt;a href=\"Challenger%202\"&gt;Challenger&lt;/a&gt; (purple), &lt;a href=\"Churchill%20tank\"&gt;Churchill&lt;/a&gt; (yellow), &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Endeavour\"&gt;Endeavour&lt;/a&gt; (red), &lt;a href=\"Hawker%20Hurricane\"&gt;Hurricane&lt;/a&gt; (green), &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Invincible%20%28R05%29\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, (blue) and &lt;a href=\"Supermarine%20Spitfire\"&gt;Spitfire&lt;/a&gt; (white).\nFor the 2017\u201318 academic year, a new house system was introduced to accommodate the expansion of the school. The four new house names are based on the four sites the school has used since its foundation in 1549, being Barton (blue), College (green), Corpus Christi (red) and Tonbridge (yellow).\nSixth form.\nThe sixth form is one of the largest in the south-east of England. Each year the school takes up to 200 students into Year 12, including about thirty external pupils of mixed gender from any school according to their GCSE results. The sixth form teaches AS and A-Level courses.\nSport.\nSchool sport participation includes &lt;a href=\"rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soccer\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"field%20hockey\"&gt;field hockey&lt;/a&gt;, cricket, rowing, &lt;a href=\"sport%20of%20athletics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"team%20handball\"&gt;handball&lt;/a&gt;, and basketball.\nCombined Cadet Force (CCF).\nThe school has a &lt;a href=\"Combined%20Cadet%20Force\"&gt;Combined Cadet Force&lt;/a&gt;, with Navy, Army and RAF sections accepting students on a voluntary basis when they reach year nine. The &lt;a href=\"Combined%20Cadet%20Force\"&gt;Combined Cadet Force&lt;/a&gt;, in particular the Army section, has roots in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Engineers\"&gt;Royal Engineers&lt;/a&gt;. The Navy section is affiliated with &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Collingwood%20%28shore%20establishment%29\"&gt;HMS Collingwood&lt;/a&gt; and, a land establishment in &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;, and also has an affiliated ship (&lt;a href=\"HMS%20Kent%20%28F78%29\"&gt;HMS Kent (F78)&lt;/a&gt;). The RAF section regularly enters teams into both regional and national competitions and have won a total of nine &lt;a href=\"Ground%20Training%20Competition\"&gt;Air Squadron Trophies&lt;/a&gt;\nSchool song.\nIn 1908, Rev C. G. Duffield (the headmaster from 1898 to 1913), wrote Latin lyrics to the music of music-master Dr H. F. Henniker for \"Gaudeamus\", the school song. The words, based on verses in &lt;a href=\"Virgil\"&gt;Virgil&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s \"&lt;a href=\"Aeneid\"&gt;Aeneid&lt;/a&gt;\", are still sung on special occasions such as upper and lower school speech days.\nNotable events.\nIn May 2016, former Maidstone Grammar School teacher &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Restarick\"&gt;Steve Restarick&lt;/a&gt; was found guilty of fraud charges, involving embezzling \u00a36,258 of the schools resources over several years.\nIn December 2020, Maidstone Grammar School was widely reported in the news for choosing to delay the reopening of the school over concerns of the impact of &lt;a href=\"Brexit\"&gt;Brexit&lt;/a&gt; on its students and staff being able to access the school.\nNotable alumni (Old Maidstonians).\nFormer pupils of the school are called \"Old Maidstonians\" and include:\n\"Art, Music &amp; Literature\"\n\"Business &amp; Commerce\"\n\"Media, television &amp; film\"\n\"Military\"\n\"Politics &amp; government\"\n\"Religion\"\n\"Science &amp; academia\"\n\"Sport\"\n\"Other\""
