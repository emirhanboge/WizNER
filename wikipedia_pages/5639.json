    "text": "The Cyrillic script ( ) is a &lt;a href=\"writing%20system\"&gt;writing system&lt;/a&gt; used for various languages across &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt; and is used as the national script in various &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20languages\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20languages\"&gt;Turkic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mongolic%20languages\"&gt;Mongolic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uralic%20languages\"&gt;Uralic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caucasian%20languages\"&gt;Caucasian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20languages\"&gt;Iranic&lt;/a&gt;-speaking countries in &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Europe\"&gt;Southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Caucasus\"&gt;Caucasus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Asia\"&gt;North Asia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"East%20Asia\"&gt;East Asia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\n, around 250\u00a0million people in Eurasia use Cyrillic as the official script for their national languages, with &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; accounting for about half of them. With the &lt;a href=\"accession%20of%20Bulgaria%20to%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;accession of Bulgaria to the European Union&lt;/a&gt; on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href=\"Latin%20script\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greek%20alphabet\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; alphabets.\nThe writing system dates back to the 9th century AD, when the &lt;a href=\"First%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tsar\"&gt;tsar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20I%20of%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Simeon I the Great&lt;/a&gt; \u2013following the cultural and political course of his father &lt;a href=\"Boris%20I%20of%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Boris I&lt;/a&gt;\u2013 commissioned a new script, the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Cyrillic%20alphabet\"&gt;Early Cyrillic alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, to be made at the &lt;a href=\"Preslav%20Literary%20School\"&gt;Preslav Literary School&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;First Bulgarian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which would replace the &lt;a href=\"Glagolitic%20script\"&gt;Glagolitic script&lt;/a&gt;, produced earlier by &lt;a href=\"Saints%20Cyril%20and%20Methodius\"&gt;Saints Cyril and Methodius&lt;/a&gt; and the same &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Naum\"&gt;disciples&lt;/a&gt; that created the new Slavic script in &lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;. The usage of the Cyrillic script in &lt;a href=\"First%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; was made official in 893. The new script became the basis of &lt;a href=\"alphabet\"&gt;alphabet&lt;/a&gt;s used in various languages in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; dominated Eastern Europe, both Slavic and non-Slavic (such as &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt;). For centuries Cyrillic was also used by Catholic and Muslim Slavs too (see &lt;a href=\"Bosnian%20Cyrillic\"&gt;Bosnian Cyrillic&lt;/a&gt;).\nCyrillic is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20alphabet\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"uncial%20script\"&gt;uncial script&lt;/a&gt;, augmented by letters from the older &lt;a href=\"Glagolitic%20alphabet\"&gt;Glagolitic alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, including some &lt;a href=\"Typographic%20ligature\"&gt;ligature&lt;/a&gt;s. These additional letters were used for &lt;a href=\"Old%20Church%20Slavonic\"&gt;Old Church Slavonic&lt;/a&gt; sounds not found in Greek. The script is named in honor of the &lt;a href=\"Cyril%20the%20Philosopher\"&gt;Saint Cyril&lt;/a&gt;, one of the two &lt;a href=\"Byzantine\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; brothers, &lt;a href=\"Saints%20Cyril%20and%20Methodius\"&gt;Saints Cyril and Methodius&lt;/a&gt;, who created the Glagolitic alphabet earlier on. Modern scholars believe that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by the early disciples of Cyril and Methodius in the &lt;a href=\"Preslav%20Literary%20School\"&gt;Preslav Literary School&lt;/a&gt;, the most important early literary and cultural centre of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;First Bulgarian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and of all &lt;a href=\"Slavs\"&gt;Slavs&lt;/a&gt;:\nUnlike the Churchmen in Ohrid, Preslav scholars were much more dependent upon Greek models and quickly abandoned the &lt;a href=\"Glagolitic%20script\"&gt;Glagolitic script&lt;/a&gt;s in favor of an adaptation of the Greek uncial to the needs of Slavic, which is now known as the Cyrillic alphabet.\nThe earliest datable Cyrillic inscriptions have been found in the area of &lt;a href=\"Preslav\"&gt;Preslav&lt;/a&gt;. They have been found in the medieval city itself, and at nearby &lt;a href=\"Patleina%20Monastery\"&gt;Patleina Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, both in present-day &lt;a href=\"Shumen%20Province\"&gt;Shumen Province&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Ravna%20Monastery\"&gt;Ravna Monastery&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Varna%20Monastery\"&gt;Varna Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the orthographic reform of Saint &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20Evtimiy%20of%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Evtimiy of Tarnovo&lt;/a&gt; and other prominent representatives of the &lt;a href=\"Tarnovo%20Literary%20School\"&gt;Tarnovo Literary School&lt;/a&gt; (14th and 15th centuries) such as &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20Tsamblak\"&gt;Gregory Tsamblak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20of%20Kostenets\"&gt;Constantine of Kostenets&lt;/a&gt; the school influenced Russian, Serbian, Wallachian and Moldavian medieval culture. That is famous in Russia as the second &lt;a href=\"South%20Slavs\"&gt;South-Slavic&lt;/a&gt; influence.\nIn the early 18th century, the Cyrillic script used in Russia was heavily reformed by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Great\"&gt;Peter the Great&lt;/a&gt;, who had recently returned from his &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Embassy%20of%20Peter%20the%20Great\"&gt;Grand Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Europe\"&gt;Western Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The new letterforms, called the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20script\"&gt;Civil script&lt;/a&gt;, became closer to those of the Latin alphabet; several archaic letters were abolished and several letters were designed by Peter himself. Letters became distinguished between upper and lower case. West European typography culture was also adopted. The pre-reform forms of letters called '\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432' were notably kept for use in Church Slavonic and are sometimes used in Russian even today, especially if one wants to give a text a 'Slavic' or 'archaic' feel.\nLetters.\nCyrillic script spread throughout the East Slavic and some South Slavic territories, being adopted for writing local languages, such as &lt;a href=\"Old%20East%20Slavic\"&gt;Old East Slavic&lt;/a&gt;. Its adaptation to local languages produced a number of Cyrillic alphabets, discussed below.\nCapital and lowercase letters were not distinguished in old manuscripts.\nYeri () was originally a &lt;a href=\"ligature%20%28typography%29\"&gt;ligature&lt;/a&gt; of Yer and I ( + = ). &lt;a href=\"Iotation\"&gt;Iotation&lt;/a&gt; was indicated by ligatures formed with the letter \u0406: (not an ancestor of modern Ya, \u042f, which is derived from ), , (ligature of and ), , . Sometimes different letters were used interchangeably, for example = = , as were typographical variants like = . There were also commonly used ligatures like = .\nThe letters also had numeric values, based not on Cyrillic alphabetical order, but inherited from the letters' &lt;a href=\"Greek%20numerals\"&gt;Greek ancestors&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe early Cyrillic alphabet is difficult to represent on computers. Many of the letterforms differed from those of modern Cyrillic, varied a great deal in &lt;a href=\"manuscript\"&gt;manuscript&lt;/a&gt;s, and changed over time. Few fonts include &lt;a href=\"glyph\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt;s sufficient to reproduce the alphabet. In accordance with &lt;a href=\"Unicode\"&gt;Unicode&lt;/a&gt; policy, the standard does not include letterform variations or &lt;a href=\"Ligature%20%28typography%29\"&gt;ligatures&lt;/a&gt; found in manuscript sources unless they can be shown to conform to the Unicode definition of a character.\nThe Unicode 5.1 standard, released on 4 April 2008, greatly improves computer support for the early Cyrillic and the modern &lt;a href=\"Church%20Slavonic\"&gt;Church Slavonic&lt;/a&gt; language. In Microsoft Windows, the &lt;a href=\"Segoe%20UI\"&gt;Segoe UI&lt;/a&gt; user interface font is notable for having complete support for the archaic Cyrillic letters since Windows 8.\nLetterforms and typography.\nThe development of Cyrillic &lt;a href=\"typography\"&gt;typography&lt;/a&gt; passed directly from the &lt;a href=\"medieval\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; stage to the late &lt;a href=\"Baroque\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt;, without a &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; phase as in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Europe\"&gt;Western Europe&lt;/a&gt;. Late Medieval Cyrillic letters (categorized as &lt;a href=\"vyaz%20%28Cyrillic%20calligraphy%29\"&gt;vyaz'&lt;/a&gt; and still found on many &lt;a href=\"icon\"&gt;icon&lt;/a&gt; inscriptions today) show a marked tendency to be very tall and narrow, with strokes often shared between adjacent letters.\n&lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Great\"&gt;Peter the Great&lt;/a&gt;, Tsar of Russia, mandated the use of &lt;a href=\"Civil%20script\"&gt;westernized letter forms&lt;/a&gt; () in the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters (such as the placement of &lt;a href=\"serif\"&gt;serif&lt;/a&gt;s, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are much the same as modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.\nLowercase forms.\nCyrillic &lt;a href=\"capital%20letters\"&gt;uppercase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lower%20case\"&gt;lowercase&lt;/a&gt; letter forms are not as differentiated as in Latin typography. Upright Cyrillic lowercase letters are essentially &lt;a href=\"small%20caps\"&gt;small capitals&lt;/a&gt; (with exceptions: Cyrillic , , , , , and adopted Western lowercase shapes, lowercase is typically designed under the influence of Latin , lowercase , and are traditional handwritten forms), although a good-quality Cyrillic typeface will still include separate small-caps glyphs.\nCyrillic fonts, as well as Latin ones, have &lt;a href=\"roman%20type\"&gt;roman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"italic%20type\"&gt;italic&lt;/a&gt; types (practically all popular modern fonts include parallel sets of Latin and Cyrillic letters, where many glyphs, uppercase as well as lowercase, are simply shared by both). However, the native font terminology in most Slavic languages (for example, in Russian) does not use the words \"roman\" and \"italic\" in this sense. Instead, the nomenclature follows German naming patterns:\nItalic and cursive forms.\nSimilarly to Latin fonts, italic and cursive types of many Cyrillic letters (typically lowercase; uppercase only for handwritten or stylish types) are very different from their upright roman types. In certain cases, the correspondence between uppercase and lowercase glyphs does not coincide in Latin and Cyrillic fonts: for example, italic Cyrillic is the lowercase counterpart of not of .\nNote: in some fonts or styles, , i.e. the lowercase italic Cyrillic , may look like Latin , and , i.e. lowercase italic Cyrillic , may look like small-capital italic .\nIn Standard Serbian, as well as in Macedonian, some italic and cursive letters are allowed to be different to more closely resemble the handwritten letters. The regular (upright) shapes are generally standardized in &lt;a href=\"small%20caps\"&gt;small caps&lt;/a&gt; form.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20alphabet\"&gt;Bulgarian typography&lt;/a&gt;, many lowercase letterforms may more closely resemble the cursive forms on the one hand and Latin glyphs on the other hand, e.g. by having an ascender or descender or by using rounded arcs instead of sharp corners. Sometimes, uppercase letters may have a different shape as well, e.g. more triangular, \u0414 and \u041b, like Greek delta \u0394 and lambda \u039b.\nNotes: Depending on fonts available, the Bulgarian row may appear identical to the Russian row. &lt;a href=\"Unicode\"&gt;Unicode&lt;/a&gt; approximations are used in the \"&lt;a href=\"Faux%20Cyrillic\"&gt;faux&lt;/a&gt;\" row to ensure it can be rendered properly across all systems; in some cases, such as \u0436 with \"k\"-like ascender, no such approximation exists.\nAccessing variant forms.\nComputer fonts typically default to the Central/Eastern, Russian letterforms, and require the use of &lt;a href=\"OpenType\"&gt;OpenType&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20typographic%20features\"&gt;Layout (OTL) features&lt;/a&gt; to display the Western, Bulgarian or Southern, Serbian/Macedonian forms. Depending on the choices of the font manufacturer, they may either be automatically activated by the \"local variant\" codice_1 feature for text tagged with an appropriate &lt;a href=\"ISO%20639-1\"&gt;language code&lt;/a&gt;, or the author needs to opt-in by activating a \"stylistic set\" codice_2 or \"character variant\" codice_3 feature. These solutions only enjoy partial support and may render with default glyphs in certain software configurations.\nCyrillic alphabets.\nAmong others, Cyrillic is the standard script for writing the following languages:\nThe Cyrillic script has also been used for languages of Alaska, &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20Europe\"&gt;Slavic Europe&lt;/a&gt; (except for &lt;a href=\"Western%20Slavs\"&gt;Western Slavic&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Slavs\"&gt;Southern Slavic&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Caucasus\"&gt;Caucasus&lt;/a&gt;, the languages of &lt;a href=\"Idel-Ural\"&gt;Idel-Ural&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siberia\"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Far%20East\"&gt;Russian Far East&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first alphabet derived from Cyrillic was &lt;a href=\"Abur\"&gt;Abur&lt;/a&gt;, used for the &lt;a href=\"Komi%20language\"&gt;Komi language&lt;/a&gt;. Other Cyrillic alphabets include the &lt;a href=\"Molodtsov%20alphabet\"&gt;Molodtsov alphabet&lt;/a&gt; for the Komi language and various alphabets for &lt;a href=\"Caucasian%20languages\"&gt;Caucasian languages&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nSince the script was conceived and popularised by the followers of &lt;a href=\"Cyril%20and%20Methodius\"&gt;Cyril and Methodius&lt;/a&gt;, rather than by Cyril and Methodius themselves, its name denotes homage rather than authorship. The name \"Cyrillic\" often confuses people who are not familiar with the script's history, because it does not identify a country of origin (in contrast to the \"Greek alphabet\"). Among the general public, it is often called \"the Russian alphabet,\" because Russian is the most popular and influential alphabet based on the script. Some Bulgarian intellectuals, notably &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Tsanev\"&gt;Stefan Tsanev&lt;/a&gt;, have expressed concern over this, and have suggested that the Cyrillic script be called the \"Bulgarian alphabet\" instead, for the sake of historical accuracy. It must be noted here that 'alphabet' is not the same as 'script' (e.g. the letter \u0407\u0457 has existed in the Cyrillic script since its very invention and is still used in Ukrainian, but is absent in the modern Bulgarian alphabet, that is Cyrillic as used in Bulgarian), so the accurate name is actually 'the Bulgarian script'.\nIn Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian, Czech and Slovak, the Cyrillic alphabet is also known as \"azbuka\", derived from the old names of the first two letters of most Cyrillic alphabets (just as the term \"alphabet\" came from the first two Greek letters \"alpha\" and \"beta\"). In Czech and Slovak, which have never used Cyrillic, \"azbuka\" refers to Cyrillic and contrasts with \"abeceda\", which refers to the local Latin script and is composed of the names of the first letters (A, B, C, and D). In Russian, &lt;a href=\"Syllabary\"&gt;syllabaries&lt;/a&gt;, especially the Japanese &lt;a href=\"kana\"&gt;kana&lt;/a&gt;, are commonly referred to as 'syllabic azbukas' rather than 'syllabic scripts'.\nHistory.\nThe Cyrillic script was created in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;First Bulgarian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Its first variant, the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Cyrillic%20alphabet\"&gt;Early Cyrillic alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, was created at the &lt;a href=\"Preslav%20Literary%20School\"&gt;Preslav Literary School&lt;/a&gt;. A number of prominent Bulgarian writers and scholars worked at the school, including &lt;a href=\"Naum%20of%20Preslav\"&gt;Naum of Preslav&lt;/a&gt; until 893; &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20of%20Preslav\"&gt;Constantine of Preslav&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"John%20the%20Exarch\"&gt;Joan Ekzarh&lt;/a&gt; (also transcr. John the Exarch); and &lt;a href=\"Chernorizets%20Hrabar\"&gt;Chernorizets Hrabar&lt;/a&gt;, among others. The school was also a centre of translation, mostly of &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; authors. The Cyrillic script is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20alphabet\"&gt;Greek uncial script&lt;/a&gt; letters, augmented by &lt;a href=\"Typographic%20ligature\"&gt;ligature&lt;/a&gt;s and consonants from the older &lt;a href=\"Glagolitic%20alphabet\"&gt;Glagolitic alphabet&lt;/a&gt; for sounds not found in Greek. Tradition holds that Glagolitic and Cyrillic were formalized by &lt;a href=\"Saints%20Cyril%20and%20Methodius\"&gt;Saints Cyril and Methodius&lt;/a&gt; and their disciples, like the Saints &lt;a href=\"Naum%20of%20Preslav\"&gt;Naum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clement%20of%20Ohrid\"&gt;Clement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Angelar\"&gt;Angelar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Sava%20%28disciple%20of%20Saints%20Cyril%20and%20Methodius%29\"&gt;Sava&lt;/a&gt;. They spread and taught Christianity in the whole of Bulgaria. Paul Cubberley posits that although Cyril may have codified and expanded Glagolitic, it was his students in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;First Bulgarian Empire&lt;/a&gt; under Tsar &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20the%20Great\"&gt;Simeon the Great&lt;/a&gt; that developed Cyrillic from the Greek letters in the 890s as a more suitable script for church books. Cyrillic spread among other Slavic peoples, as well as among non-Slavic &lt;a href=\"Vlachs\"&gt;Vlachs&lt;/a&gt;.\nCyrillic and &lt;a href=\"Glagolitic\"&gt;Glagolitic&lt;/a&gt; were used for the &lt;a href=\"Church%20Slavonic%20language\"&gt;Church Slavonic language&lt;/a&gt;, especially the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Church%20Slavonic\"&gt;Old Church Slavonic&lt;/a&gt; variant. Hence expressions such as \"\u0418 is the tenth Cyrillic letter\" typically refer to the order of the Church Slavonic alphabet; not every Cyrillic alphabet uses every letter available in the script. The Cyrillic script came to dominate Glagolitic in the 12th century.\nThe literature produced in Old Church Slavonic soon spread north from Bulgaria and became the &lt;a href=\"lingua%20franca\"&gt;lingua franca&lt;/a&gt; of the Balkans and Eastern Europe.\nThe alphabet used for the modern &lt;a href=\"Church%20Slavonic%20language\"&gt;Church Slavonic language&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Catholic\"&gt;Eastern Catholic&lt;/a&gt; rites still resembles early Cyrillic. However, over the course of the following millennium, Cyrillic adapted to changes in spoken language, developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages, and was subjected to academic reform and political decrees. A notable example of such linguistic reform can be attributed to &lt;a href=\"Vuk%20Karad%C5%BEi%C4%87\"&gt;Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107&lt;/a&gt; who updated the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Cyrillic%20alphabet\"&gt;Serbian Cyrillic alphabet&lt;/a&gt; by removing certain graphemes no longer represented in the vernacular, and introducing graphemes specific to Serbian (i.e. \u0409 \u040a \u0402 \u040b \u040f \u0408), distancing it from Church Slavonic alphabet in use prior to the reform. Today, &lt;a href=\"Languages%20using%20Cyrillic\"&gt;many languages&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Languages%20of%20the%20Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt;, Eastern Europe, and &lt;a href=\"Eurasiatic%20languages\"&gt;northern Eurasia&lt;/a&gt; are written in Cyrillic alphabets.\nUsage of Cyrillic versus other scripts.\nLatin script.\nA number of languages written in a Cyrillic alphabet have also been written in a &lt;a href=\"Latin%20alphabet\"&gt;Latin alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijani%20language\"&gt;Azerbaijani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uzbek%20language\"&gt;Uzbek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20language\"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; (in the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Moldova\"&gt;Republic of Moldova&lt;/a&gt; until 1989, in &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; throughout the 19th century). After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, some of the former republics officially shifted from Cyrillic to Latin. The transition is complete in most of Moldova (except the breakaway region of &lt;a href=\"Transnistria\"&gt;Transnistria&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Moldovan%20Cyrillic%20alphabet\"&gt;Moldovan Cyrillic&lt;/a&gt; is official), &lt;a href=\"Turkmenistan\"&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Uzbekistan\"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; still uses both systems, and &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; has officially begun a transition from Cyrillic to Latin (scheduled to be complete by 2025). The &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n government has mandated that Cyrillic must be used for all public communications in all &lt;a href=\"federal%20subjects%20of%20Russia\"&gt;federal subjects of Russia&lt;/a&gt;, to promote closer ties across the federation. This act was controversial for speakers of many Slavic languages; for others, such as &lt;a href=\"Chechen%20language\"&gt;Chechen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ingush%20language\"&gt;Ingush&lt;/a&gt; speakers, the law had political ramifications. For example, the separatist Chechen government mandated a Latin script which is still used by many Chechens. Those in the diaspora especially refuse to use the Chechen Cyrillic alphabet, which they associate with Russian imperialism.\nStandard &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20language\"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20language%23Writing%20system\"&gt;both the Cyrillic and Latin scripts&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrillic is nominally the official script of Serbia's administration according to the Serbian constitution; however, the law does not regulate scripts in standard language, or standard language itself by any means. In practice the scripts are equal, with Latin being used more often in a less official capacity.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zhuang%20alphabet\"&gt;Zhuang alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, used between the 1950s and 1980s in portions of the People's Republic of China, used a mixture of Latin, phonetic, numeral-based, and Cyrillic letters. The non-Latin letters, including Cyrillic, were removed from the alphabet in 1982 and replaced with Latin letters that closely resembled the letters they replaced.\nRomanization.\nThere are various systems for &lt;a href=\"Romanization\"&gt;Romanization&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrillic text, including &lt;a href=\"transliteration\"&gt;transliteration&lt;/a&gt; to convey Cyrillic spelling in &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; letters, and &lt;a href=\"Transcription%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;transcription&lt;/a&gt; to convey &lt;a href=\"pronunciation\"&gt;pronunciation&lt;/a&gt;.\nStandard Cyrillic-to-Latin transliteration systems include:\nSee also &lt;a href=\"Romanization%20of%20Belarusian\"&gt;Romanization of Belarusian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romanization%20of%20Bulgarian\"&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"romanization%20of%20Kyrgyz\"&gt;Kyrgyz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"romanization%20of%20Russian\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"romanization%20of%20Macedonian\"&gt;Macedonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"romanization%20of%20Ukrainian\"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt;.\nCyrillization.\nRepresenting other writing systems with Cyrillic letters is called &lt;a href=\"Cyrillization\"&gt;Cyrillization&lt;/a&gt;.\nComputer encoding.\nUnicode.\nAs of Unicode version 14.0, Cyrillic letters, including national and historical alphabets, are encoded across several &lt;a href=\"Unicode%20block\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe characters in the range U+0400 to U+045F are essentially the characters from &lt;a href=\"ISO%208859-5\"&gt;ISO 8859-5&lt;/a&gt; moved upward by 864 positions. The characters in the range U+0460 to U+0489 are historic letters, not used now. The characters in the range U+048A to U+052F are additional letters for various languages that are written with Cyrillic script.\nUnicode as a general rule does not include accented Cyrillic letters. A few exceptions include:\nTo indicate stressed or long vowels, &lt;a href=\"combining%20diacritical%20mark\"&gt;combining diacritical mark&lt;/a&gt;s can be used after the respective letter (for example, : \u0435\u0301 \u0443\u0301 \u044d\u0301 etc.).\nSome languages, including &lt;a href=\"Church%20Slavonic%20language\"&gt;Church Slavonic&lt;/a&gt;, are still not fully supported.\nUnicode 5.1, released on 4 April 2008, introduces major changes to the Cyrillic blocks. Revisions to the existing Cyrillic blocks, and the addition of Cyrillic Extended A (2DE0 ... 2DFF) and Cyrillic Extended B (A640 ... A69F), significantly improve support for the &lt;a href=\"early%20Cyrillic%20alphabet\"&gt;early Cyrillic alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abkhaz%20language\"&gt;Abkhaz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aleut%20language\"&gt;Aleut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chuvash%20language\"&gt;Chuvash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdish%20language\"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moksha%20language\"&gt;Moksha&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther.\nPunctuation for Cyrillic text is similar to that used in European Latin-alphabet languages.\nOther &lt;a href=\"character%20encoding\"&gt;character encoding&lt;/a&gt; systems for Cyrillic:\nKeyboard layouts.\nEach language has its own standard &lt;a href=\"keyboard%20layout\"&gt;keyboard layout&lt;/a&gt;, adopted from &lt;a href=\"typewriter\"&gt;typewriter&lt;/a&gt;s. With the flexibility of computer input methods, there are also transliterating or phonetic/homophonic keyboard layouts made for typists who are more familiar with other layouts, like the common English &lt;a href=\"QWERTY%20keyboard\"&gt;QWERTY keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. When practical Cyrillic keyboard layouts or fonts are unavailable, computer users sometimes use transliteration or look-alike &lt;a href=\"volapuk%20encoding\"&gt;\"volapuk\" encoding&lt;/a&gt; to type in languages that are normally written with the Cyrillic alphabet."
