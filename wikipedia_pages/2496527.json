    "text": "Sir Cresswell Cresswell, &lt;a href=\"Privy%20Councillor\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; (20 August 1794 \u2013 29 July 1863), born Cresswell Easterby, was an English lawyer, judge and &lt;a href=\"Tory\"&gt;Tory&lt;/a&gt; politician. As a judge in the newly created divorce court, Cresswell did much to start the emergence of modern &lt;a href=\"family%20law\"&gt;family law&lt;/a&gt; by setting divorce on a secular footing, removed from the traditional domain of &lt;a href=\"canon%20law\"&gt;canon law&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamily.\nBorn at &lt;a href=\"Bigg%20Market\"&gt;Bigg Market&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne\"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt;, Cresswell's father was Francis Easterby (died 1834), a &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; and sailor. His mother was Frances Dorothea \"n\u00e9e\" Cresswell (1768\u20131832), daughter of a distinguished northern family that could trace its ancestry back to the twelfth century and service in the &lt;a href=\"Crusades\"&gt;Crusades&lt;/a&gt;. The family owned land in &lt;a href=\"Northumberland\"&gt;Northumberland&lt;/a&gt; and were scions of the &lt;a href=\"Cresswell%20%28surname%29\"&gt;Cresswell&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Bibury\"&gt;Bibury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sidbury\"&gt;Sidbury&lt;/a&gt; and Sherston Pinkney, ancestors of &lt;a href=\"Edward%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward\u00a0I&lt;/a&gt;. Francis adopted the name Cresswell in 1807 when his wife inherited much of the ancestral wealth.\nHis brother &lt;a href=\"Addison%20Cresswell%20%28MP%29\"&gt;Addison&lt;/a&gt; was the Tory MP for &lt;a href=\"North%20Northumberland%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;North Northumberland&lt;/a&gt; between 1841 and 1857.\nEducation.\nCresswell was educated at &lt;a href=\"Charterhouse%20School\"&gt;Charterhouse School&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a contemporary of &lt;a href=\"Connop%20Thirlwall\"&gt;Connop Thirlwall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Grote\"&gt;George Grote&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Havelock\"&gt;Henry Havelock&lt;/a&gt;. He attended &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Trinity&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Emmanuel%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Emmanuel College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Maule\"&gt;William Henry Maule&lt;/a&gt; was his tutor. Graduating BA in 1814, he received the lowest place in the honours list of the entire university. Nonetheless, he was awarded an &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Arts%20%28Oxbridge%20and%20Dublin%29\"&gt;MA&lt;/a&gt; in 1818 and was &lt;a href=\"called%20to%20the%20bar\"&gt;called to the bar&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Temple\"&gt;Inner Temple&lt;/a&gt; in 1819.\nEarly career.\nCresswell began his practice on the northern circuit and fell under the guidance and mentorship of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Brougham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brougham%20and%20Vaux\"&gt;Henry Brougham&lt;/a&gt;. Cresswell found his familiarity with his father's nautical career an advantage in the maritime city of &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; and he soon established a reputation in &lt;a href=\"commercial%20law\"&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shipping%20law\"&gt;shipping&lt;/a&gt; cases. From 1822 to 1830 he was co-author, with &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Barnewall\"&gt;Richard Barnewall&lt;/a&gt;, of a well-received series of &lt;a href=\"law%20report\"&gt;law report&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFrom the 1820s, Brougham's and &lt;a href=\"James%20Scarlett%2C%201st%20Baron%20Abinger\"&gt;James Scarlett&lt;/a&gt;'s energies were directed elsewhere and Cresswell became a leader of the northern circuit, being made &lt;a href=\"recorder%20%28judge%29\"&gt;recorder&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20upon%20Hull\"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt; in 1830. In 1834 he was made &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Counsel\"&gt;KC&lt;/a&gt; and the same year became &lt;a href=\"Attorney%20General\"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"County%20Palatine\"&gt;County Palatine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"County%20Durham\"&gt;Durham&lt;/a&gt;.\nCresswell had gained a reputation as a \"violent Tory\" but was elected as &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; Member of Parliament for &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1837%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1837 United Kingdom general election&lt;/a&gt; and again in &lt;a href=\"1841%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1841&lt;/a&gt; when he defeated &lt;a href=\"William%20Ewart%20%28English%20politician%29\"&gt;William Ewart&lt;/a&gt;. Cresswell was &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;ed in 1842. A dedicated party-man who loyally followed Sir &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Peel\"&gt;Robert Peel&lt;/a&gt;, Cresswell made little contribution to parliamentary debate. He resigned his parliamentary seat in 1842 when he was made a judge of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Common%20Pleas%20%28England%29\"&gt;Court of Common Pleas&lt;/a&gt; by Peel, being knighted at the same time. Cresswell's contributions to the &lt;a href=\"common%20law\"&gt;common law&lt;/a&gt; were modest. He was a cautious judge, somewhat in awe of &lt;a href=\"chief%20justice%20of%20the%20common%20pleas\"&gt;chief justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Conyngham%20Tindal\"&gt;Tindal&lt;/a&gt;, and was all too willing to concur rather than to take the lead.\nIn 1856 Cresswell sat in the &lt;a href=\"Swynfen%20will%20case\"&gt;Swynfen will case&lt;/a&gt;, the case of a contested will that generated extensive &lt;a href=\"satellite%20litigation\"&gt;satellite litigation&lt;/a&gt; including a claim that the &lt;a href=\"plaintiff\"&gt;plaintiff&lt;/a&gt;'s counsel, Sir &lt;a href=\"Frederic%20Thesiger%2C%201st%20Baron%20Chelmsford\"&gt;Frederic Thesiger&lt;/a&gt;, had been guilty of &lt;a href=\"malpractice\"&gt;malpractice&lt;/a&gt; in agreeing a settlement without authority. It was further alleged that Cresswell had induced the agreement by suggesting to Thesiger at an early stage that he had formed an unfavourable view of his client's case. At Thesiger's trial, counsel &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Rann%20Kennedy\"&gt;Charles Rann Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; described Cresswell's behaviour as being of a \"highly criminal nature\" amounting to a \"fraud\" and a \"&lt;a href=\"misdemeanour\"&gt;misdemeanour&lt;/a&gt;\". Cresswell admitted having shared his impressions with Thesiger saying, \"If any gentleman had asked me a question about [the trial] I should have answered him\", sharing his adverse opinion. While this case raised some negative publicity, no legal action was taken against Cresswell.\nThe divorce court.\nIn 1858 he was named the first divorce judge-in-ordinary of the new &lt;a href=\"Court%20for%20Divorce%20and%20Matrimonial%20Causes\"&gt;Probate, Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Court&lt;/a&gt; which replaced the jurisdiction of the &lt;a href=\"ecclesiastical%20court\"&gt;ecclesiastical court&lt;/a&gt;s and created the remedy of civil divorce. He was reputedly offered a peerage at the time but declined. He did, however, become a &lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Honourable%20Privy%20Council\"&gt;privy councillor&lt;/a&gt;. Appointed with bipartisan support, such was the sensitivity of the office, there was some disquiet that a notoriously bad-tempered, confirmed bachelor had been appointed in such a role but Cresswell succeeded superbly in establishing tone, procedure and practice.\nThe new law increased petitions for divorce one hundredfold and there were fears of chaos but Cresswell took a managerial role in regulating the new flood of litigation. He showed great sensitivity in dealing with genuine grievances but upheld the sanctity of marriage and was capable of being severe when necessary. However, he was also instrumental in moving the legal view of marriage from that based on a &lt;a href=\"sacrament\"&gt;sacrament&lt;/a&gt; to that based on contract. He worked with colossal speed and energy, deciding over one thousand cases in six years, only one of which was reversed on &lt;a href=\"appeal%20%28law%29\"&gt;appeal&lt;/a&gt;. He achieved some public fame and huge respect popularly being held as representing the five million married women of Britain. His activities in this field are referred to in &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Trollope\"&gt;Anthony Trollope&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Framley%20Parsonage\"&gt;Framley Parsonage&lt;/a&gt;; \"most marriages are fairly happy, in spite of Sir Cresswell Cresswell\".\nDeath.\nCresswell died in office, from complications after a fall from his horse in London, and was buried in &lt;a href=\"Kensal%20Green%20Cemetery\"&gt;Kensal Green Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. He was unmarried and had no children so he left his considerable fortune of \u00a335,000 (\u00a32.8 million at 2003 prices) to charity."
