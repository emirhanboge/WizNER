Television services under the name Thai Thorathat (Channel 4) started on 24 June 1955 in time for national day celebrations.\nIn 1977 TTV Radio and Thailand Color Television Channel 9 moved to the present Huai Khwang headquarters in Bangkok and merged to form the Mass Communication Organization of Thailand (MCOT). In 1970, with the launch of &lt;a href=\"Channel%203%20%28Thailand%29\"&gt;Chong Sam&lt;/a&gt; (Channel 3;Defunct in 2020), its newest station, while the original Thai Thorathat (Channel Four) network was renamed Chong Kao (Channel 9).\nWitthayu Tor Tor Tor (\"TTV Radio\") later became Radio MCOT on 25 March 1977 and became the nation's first 24-hour radio station.\nColor television began in 1970 on TV3 and 1974 on TV9. Chong Kao (Channel 9) was renamed &lt;a href=\"Modernine%20TV\"&gt;Modernine TV&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.\n2001\u2013present.\nIn 2005, the Ministry of Finance announced their plan to digitize &lt;a href=\"free-to-air\"&gt;free-to-air&lt;/a&gt; television broadcasts nationwide. Trial broadcasts were undertaken, involving 1,000 households in the &lt;a href=\"Bangkok%20Metropolitan%20Area\"&gt;Bangkok Metropolitan Area&lt;/a&gt;.\nMCOT has prepared at least three new channels exclusively for &lt;a href=\"digital%20television\"&gt;digital television&lt;/a&gt;, besides the two initial channels, Modernine TV and Channel 3. Though the trials had been long over, the digital channels are (said to be) still active in test form.\nIn addition, MCOT would introduce regional television channels for each province in &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these regions will have its own dedicated television channel with localised content compared to national television making it about 80 television channels for a digitised MCOT as part of the state broadcaster's three-year restructuring plan. MCOT was expected to launch its digital terrestrial television services nationally in 2012. MCOT launched digital terrestrial television in 2013, with full service in 2014.\nIn March 2011, MCOT announced that it is also possible that MCOT may be planning to switch to &lt;a href=\"DVB-T2\"&gt;DVB-T2&lt;/a&gt; in some occasion.\nList of television channels.\nTerrestrial television current channels.\nAnalogue.\nAll Analogue television Stations was switched off in 2020\nDigital.\nBroadcasting on MCOT's 3rd MUX of 5 (UHF Channel 40 for Bangkok)\nBrand.\nCommercial breaks.\nThe logo is shown on commercial breaks and test transmissions.\nClocks.\nThe clock in &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; was not in colour until 1974.
