He was seen as a looming threat to &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Jones%20Jr\"&gt;Roy Jones Jr&lt;/a&gt; at light heavyweight due to his punching power, but instead of a unification bout, he lost the title in his next fight to &lt;a href=\"Reggie%20Johnson%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Reggie Johnson&lt;/a&gt; by a knockout in the 5th. The knockout was a brutal one, and Guthrie left the ring on a stretcher &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.boxingtimes.com/analyses/1998/980206johnson_guthrie.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of retiring, he instead moved up to cruiserweight and continued to fight, but has not fought for a belt since."
