    "text": "The 2nd BRDC International Trophy meeting \u2013 formally the International Daily Express Trophy \u2013 was held on 26 August 1950 at the &lt;a href=\"Silverstone%20Circuit\"&gt;Silverstone Circuit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The race was run to &lt;a href=\"Formula%20One\"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; regulations, and was held over two heats of 15 laps each, followed by a final race of 35 laps. Italian driver &lt;a href=\"Nino%20Farina\"&gt;Nino Farina&lt;/a&gt; emerged the winner, in an &lt;a href=\"Alfa%20Romeo%20in%20Formula%20One\"&gt;Alfa Romeo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alfa%20Romeo%20158\"&gt;158&lt;/a&gt;, repeating his victory from the &lt;a href=\"1950%20British%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;1950 British Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;, held at the same circuit in May. He beat his Argentine team-mate &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Manuel%20Fangio\"&gt;Juan Manuel Fangio&lt;/a&gt;, and British driver &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Whitehead%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Peter Whitehead&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Scuderia%20Ferrari\"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;. Other notable entrants were the two &lt;a href=\"British%20Racing%20Motors%23V%2016\"&gt;BRM V16&lt;/a&gt; cars entered for &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20Sommer\"&gt;Raymond Sommer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Walker%20%28driver%29\"&gt;Peter Walker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20Mays\"&gt;Raymond Mays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reg%20Parnell\"&gt;Reg Parnell&lt;/a&gt;. However, their legendary lack of reliability resulted in neither car completing a lap in anger."
