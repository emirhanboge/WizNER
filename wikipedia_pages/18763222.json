    "text": "Lawrence Clyde Gowell (May 2, 1948 \u2013 May 11, 2020) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"baseball%20player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. He was a right-handed &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; who played in two &lt;a href=\"games%20pitched\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; in . Gowell was drafted by the Yankees in the fourth round of the &lt;a href=\"1967%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft\"&gt;1967 Major League Baseball draft&lt;/a&gt; on June 6, 1967. After &lt;a href=\"win%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;winning&lt;/a&gt; every game at &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Little%20High%20School\"&gt;Edward Little High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Auburn%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Auburn, Maine&lt;/a&gt;, he was signed by the Yankees to a professional contract. He pitched in the &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;minor leagues&lt;/a&gt; for six years before making his major league debut, after winning 11 games in a row in Double-A. Gowell was listed at tall and .\nMajor league career.\nThe Yankees called up Gowell from their minor league organization in 1972 to play as a September call-up. Gowell made his major league debut on September 21 against the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Brewers\"&gt;Milwaukee Brewers&lt;/a&gt;. The game was held at &lt;a href=\"County%20Stadium\"&gt;County Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, with 4,185 people attending the game. After &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Torres\"&gt;Rusty Torres&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pinch%20hitter\"&gt;pinch hit&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Beene\"&gt;Fred Beene&lt;/a&gt; in the sixth inning, Gowell came in to replace Beene on the mound in the bottom of the sixth. He pitched two innings with one &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"Felipe%20Alou\"&gt;Felipe Alou&lt;/a&gt; was called on to pinch-hit for him in the top of the eighth inning. The Yankees lost the game 6-4. On October 4, as a starting pitcher (again facing Milwaukee) Gowell hit a &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt; on a 3\u20132 count, hitting a &lt;a href=\"fastball\"&gt;fastball&lt;/a&gt; by pitcher &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Lonborg\"&gt;Jim Lonborg&lt;/a&gt; for his first and only Major League &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; and the last hit by a pitcher in a regular season &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; game before the start of the &lt;a href=\"designated%20hitter\"&gt;designated hitter&lt;/a&gt; rule. The baseball that Gowell hit now resides in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum\"&gt;National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Cooperstown, New York&lt;/a&gt;. Although Gowell allowed only one run during that game, the Yankees lost 1\u20130. It was Gowell's only MLB &lt;a href=\"decision%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nGowell died while playing golf on May 11, 2020, aged 72."
