    "text": "Hymiskvi\u00f0a (Old Norse: 'The lay of Hymir'; &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse%20orthography\"&gt;anglicized&lt;/a&gt; as \"Hymiskvitha\", \"Hymiskvidha\" or \"Hymiskvida\") is a poem collected in the \"&lt;a href=\"Poetic%20Edda\"&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/a&gt;\". The poem appears to have been first written down in the late 12th century.\nSummary.\nThe &lt;a href=\"%C3%86sir\"&gt;\u00c6sir&lt;/a&gt; consult their augury twigs and decide, since \u00c6gir owns a lot of kettles for making beer, that he should be their host frequently. \u00c6gir has to reluctantly agree, but as this will be a lot of work, he makes a condition (that he hopes they won't be able to meet) that they bring a kettle large enough for him to make beer for all of them at once. That presents a problem, until &lt;a href=\"T%C3%BDr\"&gt;T\u00fdr&lt;/a&gt; remembers a particularly large kettle in the possession of his father &lt;a href=\"Hymir\"&gt;Hymir&lt;/a&gt;. So the \u00c6sir set off. Eventually they find Hymir's place, where &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;\u00de\u00f3rr&lt;/a&gt; (Thor) eats so much that Hymir and his guests have no alternative but to go fishing. The poem then tells the story of how \u00de\u00f3rr almost caught the &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B6rmungandr\"&gt;J\u00f6rmungandr&lt;/a&gt;, which is also recounted in the &lt;a href=\"Prose%20Edda\"&gt;Prose Edda&lt;/a&gt;. \u00de\u00f3rr shows off his strength, but Hymir taunts him and says that he could hardly be called strong if \u00de\u00f3rr couldn't break Hymir's chalice. The chalice was a magic one and could not be broken unless slung against Hymir's head. \u00de\u00f3rr is eventually told so and proceeds to do it. Hymir is annoyed but says that they can take the kettle and leave. There follows the slaying of hordes of &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B6tunn\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;, whereupon the \u00c6sir leave with the kettle and booze contentedly at \u00c6gir's place ever after (or at least until &lt;a href=\"Lokasenna\"&gt;Lokasenna&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe poem contains fragments of a number of myths, and it shows. There is little structure to it, and scenes follow each other in a very rough logical order. Some of the allusions are not known from other sources and it contains unusually many &lt;a href=\"kenning\"&gt;kenning&lt;/a&gt;s for an Eddic poem.\nComparative mythology.\nSimilarities between the \"Hymiskvi\u00f0a\" and the Indian \"Samudra manthan\" have been pointed out by &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Dum%C3%A9zil\"&gt;Georges Dum\u00e9zil&lt;/a&gt; and others; see ."
