    "text": "Dafnis B.C. is a Greek professional &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; club. The club's full name is Athlitikos Omilos Dafnis B.C., or A.O. Dafnis B.C. The club is located in &lt;a href=\"Dafni%2C%20Athens\"&gt;Dafni, Athens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. The colors of the team are yellow and black, and the team's symbol is the laurel branch.\nHistory.\nThe athletic organization's parent athletic union, the A.O. A.C. Dafni, was founded in 1939, when the sports club started with a &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club. In 1967, the athletic union added the basketball club, A.O. Dafni B.C., as one of its sports sections.\nIn 1969, the team competed in the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20basketball%20league%20system\"&gt;top-tier level&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Basket%20League\"&gt;Greek Basket League&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, and stayed there until 1975. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the club often competed in the Greek top-tier league (&lt;a href=\"Greek%20Basket%20League\"&gt;A1&lt;/a&gt;). Legendary &lt;a href=\"EuroLeague\"&gt;EuroLeague&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Theo%20Papaloukas\"&gt;Theo Papaloukas&lt;/a&gt;, played with the club from 1997 to 1999. In the 1998\u201399 season, Papaloukas led Dafni B.C. to the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20A2%20Basket%20League\"&gt;Greek 2nd Division&lt;/a&gt; championship. In 2010, Dafni and &lt;a href=\"Amyntas%20BC\"&gt;A.O. Amyntas&lt;/a&gt; merged, creating A.O. Amyntas Dafnis. In 2015, the two clubs broke their merger, and Dafni was reformed."
