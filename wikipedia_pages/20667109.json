    "text": "SM \"U-67 was a &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20U%2066%20submarine\"&gt;Type U 66&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"German%20Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;German Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; () during the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;. She had been &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; in November 1913 as U-8\" the second boat of the &lt;a href=\"U-7%20class%20submarine%20%28Austria-Hungary%29\"&gt;\"U-7\" class&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Navy\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Navy&lt;/a&gt; () but was sold to Germany, along with the others in her class, in November 1914.\nThe submarine was ordered as \"U-8\" from &lt;a href=\"Germaniawerft\"&gt;Germaniawerft&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt; as the second of five boats of the \"U-7\" class for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Navy became convinced that none of the submarines of the class could be delivered to the &lt;a href=\"Adriatic\"&gt;Adriatic&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;. As a consequence, the entire class, including \"U-8\", was sold to the German Imperial Navy in November 1914. Under German control, the class became known as the \"U 66\" type and the boats were renumbered; \"U-8\" became \"U-67\", and all were redesigned and reconstructed to German specifications. \"U-67\" was &lt;a href=\"launch%20%28ship%29\"&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt;ed in May 1915 and &lt;a href=\"commission%20%28ship%29\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt;ed in August. As completed, she displaced , surfaced, and , submerged. The boat was long and was armed with five &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"deck%20gun\"&gt;deck gun&lt;/a&gt;.\nA part of the IV Flotilla throughout the war, \"U-67\" sank 17 ships with a combined &lt;a href=\"gross%20register%20tonnage\"&gt;gross register tonnage&lt;/a&gt; (GRT) of 39,720 in thirteen war patrols. She also damaged four other ships of . On 20 November 1918, nine days after the &lt;a href=\"Armistice%20with%20Germany\"&gt;Armistice&lt;/a&gt;, \"U-67\" was surrendered to the British. She was broken up in 1921 at &lt;a href=\"Fareham\"&gt;Fareham&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign and construction.\nAfter the Austro-Hungarian Navy had competitively evaluated three foreign submarine designs, it selected the &lt;a href=\"Germaniawerft\"&gt;Germaniawerft&lt;/a&gt; 506d design, also known as the Type UD, for its new \"U-7\" class of five submarines. The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913.\nThe \"U-7\" class was seen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy as an improved version of its &lt;a href=\"U-3%20class%20submarine%20%28Austria-Hungary%29\"&gt;\"U-3\" class&lt;/a&gt;, which was also a Germaniawerft design. As designed for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the boats were to &lt;a href=\"displace%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displace&lt;/a&gt; on the surface and while submerged. The &lt;a href=\"hull%20%28submarine%29\"&gt;doubled-hulled&lt;/a&gt; boats were to be &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;long overall&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . The Austrian specifications called for two shafts with twin &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s ( total) for surface running at up to , and twin &lt;a href=\"electric%20motor\"&gt;electric motor&lt;/a&gt;s ( total) for a maximum of when submerged. The boats were designed with five &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s; four located in the bow, one in the stern. The boats' armament was to also include a single L/26 deck gun.\n\"U-8\" and &lt;a href=\"sister%20boat\"&gt;sister boat&lt;/a&gt; were both &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 1 November 1913, the first two boats of the class begun. Her construction was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months.\nNeither \"U-8\" nor any of her &lt;a href=\"sister%20boat\"&gt;sister boat&lt;/a&gt;s were complete when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at &lt;a href=\"Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt;, the Austrians became convinced that it would be impossible to take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;, a British territory. As a result, \"U-8\" and her four sisters were sold to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20German%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial German Navy&lt;/a&gt; on 28 November 1914.\n\"U-8\" was renumbered by the Germans as \"U-67\" when her class was redesignated as the Type U 66. The Imperial German Navy had the submarines redesigned and reconstructed to German standards, which increased the surface displacement by and the submerged by . The torpedo load was increased by a third, from 9 to 12, and the deck gun was upgraded from the gun originally specified to an &lt;a href=\"8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun\"&gt;Uk L/30&lt;/a&gt; one.\nService career.\n\"U-67\" was &lt;a href=\"launch%20%28ship%29\"&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt;ed on 15 May 1915. On 4 August, SM \"U-67\" was &lt;a href=\"commission%20%28ship%29\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt;ed into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20German%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial German Navy&lt;/a&gt; under the command of \"&lt;a href=\"Korvettenkapit%C3%A4n\"&gt;Korvettenkapit\u00e4n&lt;/a&gt;\" Erich von Rosenberg-Grusczyski. On 28 October 1915, \"U-67\" was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"IV%20Flottille\"&gt;IV. \"U-Halbflotille\"&lt;/a&gt; in which she remained for the duration of the war.\nIn March 1916, &lt;a href=\"Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant\"&gt;Kapit\u00e4nleutnant&lt;/a&gt; Hans Nieland replaced von Rosenberg-Grusczyski as the captain of \"U-67\", and it was under his command that \"U-67\" was most successful, sinking 17 ships with a combined a total of , while damaging a further four of 19,048 GRT. \"U-67\"s most successful month was April 1917, when she sank four ships of 15,223 GRT in a span of twelve days.\nNieland was succeeded as commander of \"U-67\" by &lt;a href=\"Oberleutnant%20zur%20See\"&gt;Oberleutnant zur See&lt;/a&gt; Helmuth von Rabenau in December 1917. Under his command during the last eleven months of the war, \"U-67\" sank no more ships. During her service career under three commanders, \"U-67\" had completed thirteen war patrols. She was surrendered to the British on 20 November 1918, nine days after the &lt;a href=\"Armistice%20with%20Germany\"&gt;Armistice&lt;/a&gt;, and broken up at &lt;a href=\"Fareham\"&gt;Fareham&lt;/a&gt; in 1921."
