    "text": "Donald Howard Menzel (April 11, 1901 \u2013 December 14, 1976) was one of the first theoretical &lt;a href=\"astronomer\"&gt;astronomer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"astrophysics\"&gt;astrophysicists&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. He discovered the physical properties of the solar &lt;a href=\"chromosphere\"&gt;chromosphere&lt;/a&gt;, the chemistry of stars, the atmosphere of Mars, and the nature of gaseous nebulae.\nBiography.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Florence%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Florence, Colorado&lt;/a&gt; in 1901 and raised in &lt;a href=\"Leadville%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Leadville&lt;/a&gt;, he learned to read very early, and soon could send and receive messages in &lt;a href=\"Morse%20code\"&gt;Morse code&lt;/a&gt;, taught by his father. He loved science and mathematics, collected ore and rock specimens, and as a teenager he built a large chemistry laboratory in the cellar. He made a radio transmitter at a time when kits were rarely available and qualified as a &lt;a href=\"Amateur%20radio\"&gt;radio ham&lt;/a&gt;. He was an &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Scout%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29\"&gt;Eagle Scout&lt;/a&gt;, specializing in &lt;a href=\"cryptanalysis\"&gt;cryptanalysis&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an outdoorsman, hiking and fly fishing throughout much of his life. He married Florence Elizabeth Kreager on June 17, 1926 and had two daughters (Suzanne Kay and Elizabeth Ina).\nAt 16, he enrolled in the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Denver\"&gt;University of Denver&lt;/a&gt; to study &lt;a href=\"chemistry\"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt;. His interest in astronomy was aroused through a boyhood friend (Edgar Kettering), through observing the &lt;a href=\"solar%20eclipse%20of%20June%208%2C%201918\"&gt;solar eclipse of June 8, 1918&lt;/a&gt;, and through observing the eruption of Nova Aquilae 1918 (&lt;a href=\"V603%20Aquilae\"&gt;V603 Aquilae&lt;/a&gt;). He graduated from the University of Denver in 1920 with a &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt; in chemistry and stayed on to receive a &lt;a href=\"master%27s%20degree\"&gt;master's degree&lt;/a&gt; in chemistry and mathematics from the institution in 1921. He also found summer positions in 1922, 1923, and 1924 as research assistant to &lt;a href=\"Harlow%20Shapley\"&gt;Harlow Shapley&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20College%20Observatory\"&gt;Harvard College Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. \nAt &lt;a href=\"Princeton%20University\"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; he acquired a second master's degree in astronomy in 1923, and in 1924 a Ph.D. in astrophysics for which his advisor was &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Norris%20Russell\"&gt;Henry Norris Russell&lt;/a&gt;, who inspired his interest in theoretical astronomy. After teaching for two years at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Iowa\"&gt;University of Iowa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20University\"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;, in 1926 he was appointed &lt;a href=\"assistant%20professor\"&gt;assistant professor&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lick%20Observatory\"&gt;Lick Observatory&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California\"&gt;University of California&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%2C%20California\"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked for several years. He moved to &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; in 1932. \nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Menzel was commissioned as a &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20commander%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;lieutenant commander&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; and asked to head a division of intelligence, where he used his many-sided talents, including deciphering enemy codes. Even until 1955, he worked with the Navy improving radio-wave propagation by tracking the Sun's emissions and studying the effect of the aurora on radio propagation for the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; (Menzel &amp; Boyd, p.\u00a060). Returning to Harvard after the war, he was appointed acting director of the &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Observatory\"&gt;Harvard Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in 1952, and was the full director from 1954 to 1966. The term \"Menzel Gap\" was used to refer to the absence of &lt;a href=\"Photographic%20plate%23Astronomy\"&gt;astronomical photographic plates&lt;/a&gt; during a brief period in the 1950s when plate-making operations were temporarily halted by Menzel as a cost-cutting measure. He retired from Harvard in 1971. From 1964 to his death, Menzel was a &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20State%20Department\"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt; consultant for &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;n affairs.\nHe received honorary A.M. and Sc.D. degrees from Harvard University in 1942 and the University of Denver in 1954 respectively. From 1946-1948 he was the vice president of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Astronomical%20Society\"&gt;American Astronomical Society&lt;/a&gt;, becoming their president from 1954-1956. In 1965, Menzel was given the John Evans Award of the University of Denver. In May 2001, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics hosted \"Donald H. Menzel: Scientist, Educator, Builder,\" a symposium in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Donald H. Menzel.\nMenzel traveled with several expeditions to view &lt;a href=\"solar%20eclipse\"&gt;solar eclipse&lt;/a&gt;s to obtain scientific data. On 19 June 1936, he led the Harvard-MIT expedition to the steppes of Russia (at Ak Bulak in southwestern Siberia) to observe a total eclipse. For the 9 July 1945 eclipse, he directed the Joint U.S.-Canadian expedition to Saskatchewan, although they were clouded out. Menzel observed many total solar eclipses, often leading the expeditions, including &lt;a href=\"Catalina%2C%20California\"&gt;Catalina, California&lt;/a&gt; (10 September 1923, cloudy), &lt;a href=\"Camptonville%2C%20California\"&gt;Camptonville, California&lt;/a&gt; (28 April 1930), &lt;a href=\"Fryeburg%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Fryeburg, Maine&lt;/a&gt; (31 August 1932), &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis-St.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; (30 June 1954), the Atlantic coast of &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; (2 October 1959), northern &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; (15 February 1951), &lt;a href=\"Orono%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Orono, Maine&lt;/a&gt; (20 July 1963, cloudy), &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;/Sunion Road, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; (20 May 1966), &lt;a href=\"Arequipa%2C%20Peru\"&gt;Arequipa, Peru&lt;/a&gt; (12 November 1966), &lt;a href=\"Miahuatl%C3%A1n%20District\"&gt;Miahuatlan&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"Oaxaca%2C%20Oaxaca\"&gt;Oaxaca, Mexico&lt;/a&gt; (7 March 1970), &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Edward%20Island\"&gt;Prince Edward Island&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; (10 July 1972), and western &lt;a href=\"Mauritania\"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt; (30 June 1973), in addition to the other three mentioned above. He proudly held the informal record for greatest number of observed solar eclipses, a \"title\" later broken by his student, colleague, and co-author &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Pasachoff\"&gt;Jay Pasachoff&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the late 1930s he built an observatory for solar research at &lt;a href=\"Climax%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Climax, CO&lt;/a&gt;, using a telescope that mimicked a total eclipse of the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him and his colleagues to study the &lt;a href=\"solar%20corona\"&gt;solar corona&lt;/a&gt; and to film the spouting flames, called &lt;a href=\"solar%20prominence\"&gt;prominences&lt;/a&gt;, emitted by the Sun. Menzel initially performed solar research, but later concentrated on studying gaseous &lt;a href=\"nebula\"&gt;nebula&lt;/a&gt;e. His work with &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20Aller\"&gt;Lawrence Aller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Gilbert%20Baker\"&gt;James Gilbert Baker&lt;/a&gt; defined many of the fundamental principles of the study of &lt;a href=\"planetary%20nebula\"&gt;planetary nebula&lt;/a&gt;e. He wrote the first edition (1964) of \"A Field Guide to the Stars and Planets\", part of the &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Tory%20Peterson\"&gt;Peterson&lt;/a&gt; Field Guides. In one of his last papers, Menzel concluded, based on his analysis of the Schwarzschild equations, that &lt;a href=\"black%20hole\"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt;s do not exist, and he declared them to be a myth.\nHe also believed in the EPH (exploded planet hypothesis), stating, 'Presque toutes ces petites plan\u00e8tes circulent entre les orbites de Mars et Jupiter. On admet qu'elles repr\u00e9sentent les fragments dispers\u00e9s d'une grande plan\u00e8te qui se serait d\u00e9sint\u00e9gr\u00e9e.'\nMenzel was a science fiction author; his \"Fin's Funeral\" appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction\"&gt;Galaxy Science Fiction&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1965. He was also an artist, creating watercolor paintings of alien creatures and scenes which often featured 3-dimensional \"holes\" though characters, clouds, and alien spaceships.\nMenzel's \"Field Guide\".\nMenzel wrote the first edition of \"A Field Guide to the Stars and Planets\", published in 1975 by &lt;a href=\"HarperCollins\"&gt;HarperCollins&lt;/a&gt;, which rapidly became a best-seller. Subsequent editions were prepared after Menzel's death by his student &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Pasachoff\"&gt;Jay Pasachoff&lt;/a&gt;; the current version is one of the &lt;a href=\"Peterson%20Field%20Guides\"&gt;Peterson Field Guides&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Chapter IV of the first edition, Menzel apportions all 88 of the modern constellations recognized by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Astronomical%20Union\"&gt;International Astronomical Union&lt;/a&gt; into 8 broad families, as a way to help observers remember where the constellations are located.\nThe families are organized by common location or common theme. The Ursa Major, Perseus, Hercules, and Orion families include mainly constellations in the general vicinity of those four constellations. The Zodiac family includes the traditional 12 &lt;a href=\"Zodiac\"&gt;Zodiac&lt;/a&gt; constellations. The Heavenly Waters family includes mostly constellations generally associated with water. The Bayer family includes southern constellations first introduced by &lt;a href=\"Petrus%20Plancius\"&gt;Plancius&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently included in &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Bayer\"&gt;Johann Bayer&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Uranometria\"&gt;Uranometria&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1603. The La\u00a0Caille family includes most of the constellations introduced by &lt;a href=\"Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille\"&gt;Lacaille&lt;/a&gt; in 1756 from stars charted during his observations at Cape Town.\nMenzel and UFOs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Psychological%20Strategy%20Board\"&gt;Psychological Strategy Board&lt;/a&gt; commissioned Menzel to advocate for skepticism concerning the reality of &lt;a href=\"UFO\"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt;s. He authored or co-authored three popular books to &lt;a href=\"debunker\"&gt;debunk&lt;/a&gt; UFOs: \"Flying Saucers - Myth - Truth - History\" (1953), \"The World of Flying Saucers\" (1963, co-authored with Lyle G Boyd), and \"The UFO Enigma\" (1977, co-authored with &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20H.%20Taves\"&gt;Ernest H. Taves&lt;/a&gt;). All of Menzel's UFO books argued that UFOs are nothing more than misidentification of prosaic phenomena such as stars, clouds and airplanes; or the result of people seeing unusual atmospheric phenomena they were unfamiliar with. He was among the first prominent scientists to offer an opinion on the matter. One of Menzel's earliest public involvements in UFO matters was his appearance on a &lt;a href=\"radio\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; documentary directed and narrated by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20R.%20Murrow\"&gt;Edward R. Murrow&lt;/a&gt; in mid-1950. (Swords, 98)\nMenzel claimed to have his own UFO experience on 3 March 1955 while returning from the &lt;a href=\"North%20Pole\"&gt;North Pole&lt;/a&gt; on the daily &lt;a href=\"Air%20Force%20Weather%20Agency\"&gt;Air Force Weather&lt;/a&gt; \"Ptarmigan\" flight. His account is in both Menzel &amp; Boyd and Menzel &amp; Taves, in which he identified the 'flying saucer' he observed, as a mirage of &lt;a href=\"Sirius\"&gt;Sirius&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Steuart%20Campbell\"&gt;Steuart Campbell&lt;/a&gt; claimed that it was a mirage of &lt;a href=\"Saturn\"&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt;). Menzel often explained that atmospheric &lt;a href=\"haze\"&gt;haze&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"temperature%20inversion\"&gt;temperature inversion&lt;/a&gt;s could distort stars or planets, and make them appear to be larger than in reality, unusual in their shape, and in motion.\nIn 1968, Menzel testified before the U.S. House Committee on Science and Astronautics - Symposium on UFOs, stating that he considered all &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20reported%20UFO%20sightings\"&gt;UFO sightings&lt;/a&gt; to have natural explanations.\nLegacy.\nThe minor planet &lt;a href=\"1967%20Menzel\"&gt;1967 Menzel&lt;/a&gt; was named in his honor, as well as a small &lt;a href=\"Menzel%20%28crater%29\"&gt;lunar crater&lt;/a&gt; located in the southeast of Mare Tranquilitatis, the Sea of Tranquility.\nPublications.\nMenzel published over &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20160304003533/http%3A//oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua17001\"&gt;270 scientific and other papers&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe also wrote a popular account of astronomy: \"A Field Guide to the Stars and Planets Including the Moon, Satellites, Comets and Other Features of the Universe\" (1975); 2nd edition (1984) by Menzel and Pasachoff, 3rd edition (1992) by Pasachoff and Menzel, 4th edition (2000) by Pasachoff."
