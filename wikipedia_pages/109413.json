As of the 2010 census, the population was 15,313, up from 14,393 in 2000. After three decades of population loss, Brownsville gained population for the first time in over 40 years in the 2010 US Census.\nHistory.\nBrownsville was originally a settlement for &lt;a href=\"White%20American\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; families in the 1920s. &lt;a href=\"African%20Americans\"&gt;Black families&lt;/a&gt; began moving into the neighborhood between the late 1940s and early 1960s as the population surrounding nearby &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Square%20%28Miami%29\"&gt;Liberty Square&lt;/a&gt; expanded and many inner-city &lt;a href=\"white%20flight\"&gt;whites moved&lt;/a&gt; to newly built &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt;an subdivisions surrounding Miami &lt;a href=\"city%20proper\"&gt;city proper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Post%E2%80%93World%20War%20II%20economic%20expansion\"&gt;the wake of World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1945, two black couples who lived in Brownsville were arrested and jailed for allegedly mishandling their garbage disposal. That same year, members of the &lt;a href=\"Ku%20Klux%20Klan\"&gt;Ku Klux Klan&lt;/a&gt; burned crosses in lawns and marched against black home ownership in the area.\nBy the mid-1960s, Brownsville was a thriving community for black professionals. However, the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201968\"&gt;Civil Rights Act of 1968&lt;/a&gt; that outlawed the &lt;a href=\"restrictive%20covenants\"&gt;restrictive covenants&lt;/a&gt; and riots in &lt;a href=\"1968%20Republican%20National%20Convention\"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1980%20Miami%20riots\"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt; brought the &lt;a href=\"black%20flight\"&gt;black flight&lt;/a&gt; of middle and upper-class families from the community. Brownsville experienced continued population loss from 1970 until 2000, as part of a greater &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt;anization trend of among the U.S. upwardly-mobile &lt;a href=\"middle%20class\"&gt;middle class&lt;/a&gt;.
