It serves as the &lt;a href=\"flagship%20%28broadcasting%29\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt; television station of locally based &lt;a href=\"Forum%20Communications%20Company\"&gt;Forum Communications Company&lt;/a&gt;, which also owns &lt;a href=\"WDAY%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WDAY radio&lt;/a&gt; (970 AM) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Forum%20of%20Fargo-Moorhead\"&gt;The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead&lt;/a&gt;\". The television and radio stations share studios on South 8th Street in downtown Fargo, while WDAY-TV's transmitter is located near &lt;a href=\"Amenia%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Amenia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSemi-satellites.\nWDAY-TV serves one of the largest geographic viewing areas of any station in the United States. It consists of all of &lt;a href=\"North%20Dakota\"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt; as well as northwestern &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href=\"South%20Dakota\"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, eastern &lt;a href=\"Montana\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"southern%20Manitoba\"&gt;southern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Manitoba\"&gt;Manitoba&lt;/a&gt;, Canada including &lt;a href=\"Winnipeg\"&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"northwestern%20Ontario\"&gt;far western&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, Canada including &lt;a href=\"Kenora%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Kenora&lt;/a&gt;. It covers this region with a network of three full-power &lt;a href=\"broadcast%20relay%20station%23Semi-satellites\"&gt;semi-satellites&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"WDAZ-TV\"&gt;WDAZ-TV&lt;/a&gt; (channel 8) in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Forks%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Grand Forks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KBMY\"&gt;KBMY&lt;/a&gt; (channel 17) in &lt;a href=\"Bismarck%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Bismarck&lt;/a&gt;, and KMCY (channel 14) in &lt;a href=\"Minot%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Minot&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is a semi-satellite of KBMY.\nWDAZ-TV.\nWDAZ-TV (channel 8), serving Grand Forks and licensed to &lt;a href=\"Devils%20Lake%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Devils Lake&lt;/a&gt;, operates as a semi-satellite of WDAY-TV. As such, it &lt;a href=\"simulcast\"&gt;simulcast&lt;/a&gt;s all network and &lt;a href=\"broadcast%20syndication\"&gt;syndicated&lt;/a&gt; programming as provided through WDAY-TV, and the two stations share a website. However, WDAZ-TV airs separate &lt;a href=\"station%20identification\"&gt;legal identifications&lt;/a&gt; and commercial inserts targeting the Grand Forks metro and northern portion of the Fargo\u2013Grand Forks &lt;a href=\"media%20market\"&gt;market&lt;/a&gt;. Local newscasts, produced by WDAY-TV, are simulcast on both stations. The two stations are counted as a single unit for &lt;a href=\"Nielsen%20ratings\"&gt;ratings&lt;/a&gt; purposes. \nKBMY/KMCY.\nKBMY (channel 17) in Bismarck, and KMCY (channel 14) in Minot, clear all network programming as provided through WDAY-TV and simulcast WDAY-TV's newscasts, but airs a separate offering of syndicated programming; there are also separate commercial inserts and legal station identifications. Internal operations are based at WDAY-TV's studios in Fargo.\nHistory.\nWDAY-TV went on the air for the first time in 1953 as the second television station in North Dakota (after KCJB-TV, now &lt;a href=\"KXMC-TV\"&gt;KXMC-TV&lt;/a&gt;, in Minot), and the first in Fargo and the eastern part of the state. It was owned by a group of Fargo investors led by Norman Black, owner and publisher of \"The Forum.\" It took its call letters from WDAY radio, which has been owned by \"The Forum\" since 1935. Black bought the remaining shares in 1958.\nIt originally carried programming from all four networks of the day\u2013&lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, ABC and &lt;a href=\"DuMont%20Television%20Network\"&gt;DuMont&lt;/a&gt;. However, it was a primary NBC affiliate owing to its radio sister's long affiliation with NBC radio. It lost CBS to &lt;a href=\"KXJB-TV\"&gt;KXJB-TV&lt;/a&gt; (channel 4) in 1954, lost DuMont later in 1955 as that network was winding up operations, and lost ABC in 1959 when KXGO-TV (channel 11, now &lt;a href=\"KVLY-TV\"&gt;KVLY-TV&lt;/a&gt;) signed on. In 1983, WDAY-TV swapped affiliations with channel 11, then known as KTHI-TV, and became an ABC affiliate.\nAlthough it was apparent that Fargo and Grand Forks were going to be a single market, channel 6 did not cover the northern portion of this vast market very well. It was required to conform its signal to protect &lt;a href=\"CBC%20Television\"&gt;CBC Television&lt;/a&gt;'s Winnipeg station, &lt;a href=\"CBWT-DT\"&gt;CBWT&lt;/a&gt;, which took to the air on channel 6 a year after WDAY-TV signed on. As a result, it was barely viewable in northern Grand Forks and could not be seen at all in much of the northern part of the market. To solve this problem, it signed on WDAZ-TV in 1967 as a semi-satellite for the northern portion of the market.\nWDAY-TV and WDAZ-TV began operating &lt;a href=\"The%20WB%20100%2B%20Station%20Group\"&gt;cable-only&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20WB\"&gt;WB&lt;/a&gt; affiliate \"WBFG\" in 1998. WDAY/WDAZ replaced &lt;a href=\"The%20CW%20Plus\"&gt;The CW Plus&lt;/a&gt; successor of \"WBFG\" with the Justice Network (which moved from 6.4) on new digital broadcast subchannels WDAY 6.2 and WDAZ 8.2 on September 12, 2016 and WDAY'Z Xtra (which launched in 2013) on digital subchannel 6.3 in the Fargo area and 8.3 in the Grand Forks area. WDAY-DT4 returned to the air in 2017 as an affiliate of &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Television\"&gt;Ion Television&lt;/a&gt;.\nWDAY-TV is one of the westernmost stations in the country whose call sign begins with W. Most stations west of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt; begin with K; however, WDAY radio signed on in 1922, a year before the U.S. government moved the K-W boundary from the state borders between 102 and 104 degrees West longitude (including the North Dakota\u2013Montana border) to the Mississippi River.\nWDAY Xtra.\nWDAY Xtra is a &lt;a href=\"digital%20subchannel\"&gt;digital subchannel&lt;/a&gt; carried on WDAY 6.3, WDAZ 8.3, KBMY 17.3, and KMCY 14.3, airing as a primary affiliation to &lt;a href=\"MyNetworkTV\"&gt;MyNetworkTV&lt;/a&gt; on KBMY and KMCY but &lt;a href=\"Independent%20station%20%28North%20America%29\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; without interruption on WDAY-TV and WDAZ-TV.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//titantvguide.titantv.com/apg/ttv.aspx%3Fsiteid%3D77125\"&gt;\u2074&lt;/a&gt; This subchannel airs syndicated programming, North Dakota and Minnesota high school sports, North Dakota high school state tournaments, &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20State%20University%20Moorhead\"&gt;Minnesota State University Moorhead&lt;/a&gt; Athletics, and select &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;University of North Dakota&lt;/a&gt; athletic events. It airs &lt;a href=\"Weather%20radar\"&gt;Doppler weather radar&lt;/a&gt; and \"Storm Tracker\" weather loop with easy listening music during overnights. WDAY Xtra is carried on all cable providers in the coverage area.\nWDAY Xtra became available in &lt;a href=\"High-definition%20television\"&gt;HD&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, and in 2016, MyNetworkTV programming began airing in prime time, although on KBMY and KMCY only (in Bismarck and Minot respectively) but not on WDAY or WDAZ; &lt;a href=\"KRDK-TV\"&gt;KRDK-TV&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valley%20City%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Valley City&lt;/a&gt; serves as Fargo's MyNetworkTV affiliate.\nNews operation and programming.\nWDAY-TV presently broadcasts 37\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts and other programming each week (with 6\u00bd hours each weekday, 3\u00bd hours\u00a0on Saturdays, and two hours on Sundays). WDAY's newscasts have traditionally led the ratings in the Fargo\u2013Grand Forks market. \nWDAZ once had a larger news presence, as it aired separate 5 p.m., 6 p.m., 10 p.m., and weekend newscasts, with the only WDAY newscast airing being the morning \"First News\". WDAZ's weekend news was taken over by WDAY in 2011 and its 5\u00a0p.m. weekday newscast was taken over in July 2014. The decision to replace the 5\u00a0p.m. broadcast was met with an immediate backlash from viewers, including those who circulated a petition on &lt;a href=\"Change.org\"&gt;Change.org&lt;/a&gt; demanding that Forum restore the local 5 p.m. news to WDAZ.\nOn February 22, 2012, WDAY-TV began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. KBMY and KMCY began airing some of WDAY's newscasts in 2014.\nWDAY-TV &lt;a href=\"sign-on%20and%20sign-off\"&gt;signs off&lt;/a&gt; briefly in the overnight hours; as a result, ABC's overnight news program, \"&lt;a href=\"World%20News%20Now\"&gt;World News Now&lt;/a&gt;\", is not broadcast. It goes off the air at 3:37\u00a0a.m. and signs on again at 4\u00a0a.m. to broadcast \"&lt;a href=\"America%20This%20Morning\"&gt;America This Morning&lt;/a&gt;\". \nIn August 2016, WDAY-TV launched a half-hour prime time newscast on its second and third subchannels called \"WDAY Xtra News at 9\". It is simulcast on WDAZ's subchannels in Grand Forks, as well as KBMY/KMCY's subchannels in the Bismarck\u2013Minot market.\nOn September 11, 2017, WDAY-TV launched a 4 p.m. weekday newscast that is simulcast on sister station WDAZ. It was the first afternoon newscast ever to air in the market.\nOn November 30, 2018, it was announced that WDAZ would merge its news department with that of WDAY-TV, resulting in the cancellation of WDAZ's separate 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts, effective December 21. General manager Joshua Roher cited \"changes to distribution of television, emerging technologies and economic factors in our area\" as reasons for the consolidation, in a statement to the \"Grand Forks Herald\". WDAY-TV continues to maintain a news bureau and sales office in Grand Forks.\nOn September 5, 2021, WDAY-TV launched a Sunday morning newscast that is simulcast on sister stations WDAZ and KBMY/KMCY. It was the first Sunday morning newscast to air in the market.\nTechnical information.\nSubchannels.\nThe station's digital signal is &lt;a href=\"Multiplex%20%28TV%29\"&gt;multiplexed&lt;/a&gt;:\nAnalog-to-digital conversion.\nWDAY-TV shut down its analog signal, over &lt;a href=\"Very%20high%20frequency\"&gt;VHF&lt;/a&gt; channel 6, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States &lt;a href=\"Digital%20television%20transition%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition &lt;a href=\"UHF\"&gt;UHF&lt;/a&gt; channel 21. Through the use of &lt;a href=\"Program%20and%20System%20Information%20Protocol\"&gt;PSIP&lt;/a&gt;, digital television receivers display the station's &lt;a href=\"virtual%20channel\"&gt;virtual channel&lt;/a&gt; as its former VHF analog channel 6."
