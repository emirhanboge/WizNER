    "text": "Hammersmith was a &lt;a href=\"Civil%20parishes%20in%20England\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20boroughs%20of%20the%20County%20of%20London\"&gt;metropolitan borough&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, England. It was formed as a civil parish in 1834 from the chapelry of Hammersmith that had existed in the &lt;a href=\"ancient%20parish\"&gt;ancient parish&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Fulham%20%28parish%29\"&gt;Fulham&lt;/a&gt;, Middlesex since 1631. The parish was grouped with Fulham as the &lt;a href=\"Fulham%20District%20%28Metropolis%29\"&gt;Fulham District&lt;/a&gt; from 1855 until 1886, when separate parish administration was restored. In 1889 it became part of the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20London\"&gt;County of London&lt;/a&gt; and in 1900 it became a metropolitan borough. It included &lt;a href=\"Hammersmith\"&gt;Hammersmith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wormwood%20Scrubs\"&gt;Wormwood Scrubs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Oak%20Common\"&gt;Old Oak Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shepherd%27s%20Bush\"&gt;Shepherd's Bush&lt;/a&gt;. In 1965 it was abolished and became the northern part of the London Borough of Hammersmith, since 1979 renamed the &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Hammersmith%20and%20Fulham\"&gt;London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nHammersmith was part of the ancient parish of Fulham, Middlesex which occupied broadly the same area as the current &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Hammersmith%20and%20Fulham\"&gt;London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham&lt;/a&gt; in Greater London.\nA &lt;a href=\"chapel%20of%20ease\"&gt;chapel of ease&lt;/a&gt; was built for Hammersmith in 1631 and the chapelry developed its own independent vestry. This was recognised in 1834 when the parish of Hammersmith was split from the parish of Fulham. In 1855 the two parishes were combined for civil purposes as the &lt;a href=\"Fulham%20District%20%28Metropolis%29\"&gt;Fulham District&lt;/a&gt;, governed by the Fulham District Board of Works. This coincided with the parish becoming part of the area of responsibility of the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Board%20of%20Works\"&gt;Metropolitan Board of Works&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1886 the district was dissolved and the parish was governed by the Hammersmith Vestry. It was transferred from the &lt;a href=\"Middlesex\"&gt;County of Middlesex&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20London\"&gt;County of London&lt;/a&gt; in 1889. The parish became a &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20boroughs%20of%20the%20County%20of%20London\"&gt;metropolitan borough&lt;/a&gt; in 1900 and the Hammersmith Vestry became Hammersmith Borough Council.\nIn 1965 it was merged with the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Fulham\"&gt;Metropolitan Borough of Fulham&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Hammersmith%20and%20Fulham\"&gt;London Borough of Hammersmith&lt;/a&gt; and was renamed Hammersmith and Fulham in 1979. The new London borough council retained Hammersmith's motto of &lt;a href=\"Spectemur%20agendo\"&gt;Spectemur Agendo&lt;/a&gt;, although it was spelled out in English (\"Let us be judged by our acts\") in the &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20London%20Borough%20of%20Hammersmith%20and%20Fulham\"&gt;new coat of arms&lt;/a&gt; for the first few years.\nCoat of arms.\nThe coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith was granted in 1897. It was \"Per pale azure and gules on a chevron or between in chief two cross crosslets and in base a scallop argent, three horseshoes of the second.\" The cross crosslets come from the arms of &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Latymer\"&gt;Edward Latymer&lt;/a&gt;, who founded schools in Hammersmith in the seventeenth century which later evolved into &lt;a href=\"Latymer%20Upper%20School\"&gt;Latymer Upper School&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Godolphin%20and%20Latymer%20School\"&gt;Godolphin and Latymer School&lt;/a&gt; (both feature cross crosslets in their coats of arms). The horseshoes come from the arms of brickmaker &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Nicholas%20Crispe%2C%201st%20Baronet\"&gt;Nicholas Crisp&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced his technique into Hammersmith and who helped build a chapel, which was to become Hammersmith's parish church of Saint Paul; and the scallop comes from the arms of George Pring, a surgeon who projected &lt;a href=\"Hammersmith%20Bridge\"&gt;Hammersmith Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. The crest was a castle tower surmounted by two hammers, a pun on the name Hammersmith.\nPoor law.\nWith the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Poor%20Law\"&gt;New Poor Law&lt;/a&gt; the parish became part of the Kensington Poor Law Union in 1837. From 1845, it was grouped with Fulham as the Fulham Poor Law Union. In 1889 Hammersmith became a single parish for poor law purposes and this lasted until the boards of guardians were abolished in 1930.\nPopulation and area.\nThe borough covered . It included &lt;a href=\"Hammersmith\"&gt;Hammersmith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wormwood%20Scrubs\"&gt;Wormwood Scrubs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Oak%20Common\"&gt;Old Oak Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shepherd%27s%20Bush\"&gt;Shepherd's Bush&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe population in each census was:\nHammersmith Vestry 1801\u20131899\nMetropolitan Borough 1900\u20131961\nPolitics.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Metropolis%20Management%20Act%201855\"&gt;Metropolis Management Act 1855&lt;/a&gt; any parish that exceeded 2,000 &lt;a href=\"Rates%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;ratepayers&lt;/a&gt; was to be divided into wards; however the parishes of Fulham District Board of Works did not exceed this number so were not divided into wards.\nIn 1873 the population had increased enough for the parish of Hammersmith to be divided into three wards (electing &lt;a href=\"vestrymen\"&gt;vestrymen&lt;/a&gt;): North (24), Centre (27) and South (21).\nIn 1894 as its population had increased the newly incorporated vestry was re-divided into six wards (electing &lt;a href=\"vestrymen\"&gt;vestrymen&lt;/a&gt;): No. 1 (12), No. 2 (18), No. 3 (15), No. 4 (15), No. 5 (6) and No. 6 (6).\nThe metropolitan borough was divided into seven &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28electoral%20subdivision%29\"&gt;wards&lt;/a&gt; for elections: No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7.\nParliament constituency.\nFor elections to &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, the borough was represented by one constituency:\nIn 1918 the borough's representation was increased to two seats:\nIn 1955 the borough's representation was reduced to one and a half seats, when part of it was merged with &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Fulham\"&gt;Fulham&lt;/a&gt;:\nFurther reading.\n "
