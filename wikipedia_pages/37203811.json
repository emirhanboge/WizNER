    "text": "The passenger steamer SS \"Peel Castle\" was operated by the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man%20Steam%20Packet%20Company\"&gt;Isle of Man Steam Packet Company&lt;/a&gt; from her purchase in 1912 until she was sold for breaking in 1939.\nConstruction and dimensions.\nPeel Castle was built as \"Duke of York\" at &lt;a href=\"Dumbarton\"&gt;Dumbarton&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"William%20Denny%20and%20Brothers\"&gt;William Denny and Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, who also supplied her engines and boilers. She had a registered tonnage of ; length 310 feet; &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; 37 feet; &lt;a href=\"Draught%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; 16 feet and a design speed of 17 knots.\nPeel Castle had accommodation for 1,162 passengers, and a crew of 42.\nPre-war service.\nAs \"Duke of York\" she entered service in 1894 on the joint &lt;a href=\"Fleetwood\"&gt;Fleetwood&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Belfast\"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; service of the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway and the London &amp; North Western Railway. In 1911, she was sold to the \"Turkish Patriotic Committee\". In 1912 the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man%20Steam%20Packet%20Company\"&gt;Isle of Man Steam Packet Company&lt;/a&gt; purchased her and renamed her \"&lt;a href=\"Peel%20Castle\"&gt;Peel Castle&lt;/a&gt;\"; the company also purchased \"Duke of Lancaster\", renamed \"The Ramsey\".\nWar service.\nShe was requisitioned by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Admiralty\"&gt;Admiralty&lt;/a&gt; at the outbreak of war in 1914.\nShe was fitted out as an &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20boarding%20vessel\"&gt;Armed Boarding Vessel (ABV)&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Cammell%20Laird\"&gt;Cammell Laird&lt;/a&gt; in late November 1914. She was to have 100 officers and crew and was fitted out as an &lt;a href=\"auxiliary%20ship\"&gt;auxiliary&lt;/a&gt;, capable of carrying boarding parties and &lt;a href=\"prize%20crew\"&gt;prize crew&lt;/a&gt;s, and was put under the command of Lieutenant-Commander P. E. Haynes &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy%20Reserve\"&gt;RNR&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Peel Castle\" sailed under the &lt;a href=\"White%20Ensign\"&gt;White Ensign&lt;/a&gt; in January 1915, her engine room manned mostly by Steam Packet Company personnel, and became part of the Downs Boarding Flotilla, a section of the &lt;a href=\"Dover%20Patrol\"&gt;Dover Patrol&lt;/a&gt;. She remained with the Patrol for three years and one month.\nShe would spend ten days at sea and four days in port at &lt;a href=\"Dover\"&gt;Dover&lt;/a&gt;. She was mainly tasked with regulating the large amount of maritime traffic between the &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; coast and the &lt;a href=\"Goodwin%20Sands\"&gt;Goodwin Sands&lt;/a&gt; and to act as one of the guard ships that would stop and examine all neutral shipping proceeding to Continental ports. For the duration of the war the &lt;a href=\"Dover%20Strait\"&gt;Dover Strait&lt;/a&gt; was closed by anti-submarine nets and &lt;a href=\"minefield\"&gt;minefield&lt;/a&gt;s. No ship could pass except through the Patrol, and at one stage British warships were intercepting, searching and marshalling up to 115 vessels a day.\nIn this strenuous work, \"Peel Castle\" played a busy and successful part. She was first fired upon by a retreating merchantman, and then at least once by &lt;a href=\"artillery%20battery\"&gt;British shore batteries&lt;/a&gt;. She endured many air raids and sent boarding parties onto many ships. Her crew captured a number of enemy personnel who were trying to get back to Europe hidden in neutral ships, including &lt;a href=\"Franz%20von%20Rintelen\"&gt;Franz von Rintelen&lt;/a&gt;, an infamous agent of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Tirpitz\"&gt;Admiral Tirpitz&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1916 she was badly damaged by fire and had to be refitted at &lt;a href=\"Chatham%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Chatham&lt;/a&gt;. Later she transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Orkney%20Islands\"&gt;Orkney Islands&lt;/a&gt;. After having been fitted with &lt;a href=\"depth%20charge\"&gt;depth charge&lt;/a&gt; throwers and &lt;a href=\"Paravane%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;paravanes&lt;/a&gt; and with her &lt;a href=\"boat%20deck\"&gt;boat deck&lt;/a&gt; extended as a landing for &lt;a href=\"kite%20balloon\"&gt;kite balloon&lt;/a&gt;s, she patrolled north of &lt;a href=\"Shetland\"&gt;Shetland&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Peel Castle\" was next moved to the Humber-Tyne Patrol, an area where shipping was very concentrated and where losses had been heavy. With her observer aloft in the &lt;a href=\"Observation%20balloon\"&gt;balloon&lt;/a&gt; she would cruise up and down the &lt;a href=\"convoy\"&gt;convoy&lt;/a&gt;s, looking for enemy &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe war over, \"Peel Castle\" was refitted once more, this time as a troop carrier, work she continued until May 1919, after which she returned to &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; and resumed her peacetime Steam Packet Company duties.\nPost-war service.\nUpon returning to the Steam Packet fleet, \"Peel Castle\" was mainly used for subsidiary winter services. She undertook the direct Friday sailing from &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ramsey%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;, and also excursion trips and cargo duties.\nOn the morning of Saturday 7 June 1924, \"Peel Castle\" went aground in Douglas Bay. She had left &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; operating the sailing, and had approximately 550 passengers embarked. As she approached &lt;a href=\"Douglas%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Douglas&lt;/a&gt;, \"Peel Castle\" encountered a bank of &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt; which forced her to slow her speed. Steaming at minimal speed, \"Peel Castle\" continued inbound to &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Harbour\"&gt;Douglas&lt;/a&gt;, sounding her &lt;a href=\"Whistle%23Ships\"&gt;whistle&lt;/a&gt; continuously, but ran &lt;a href=\"Ship%20grounding\"&gt;aground&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Shoal%23Sandbars%20and%20longshore%20bars\"&gt;bank of sand&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of Douglas foreshore. The impact was reported to be so slight that passengers were unaware of the situation until members of the &lt;a href=\"ship%27s%20company\"&gt;ship's company&lt;/a&gt; informed them of the development.\nAs the tide receded and the fog began to lift, a large crowd gathered on the shore. Passengers remained on board \"Peel Castle\" until she refloated. Shortly after the vessel was refloated, aided by the &lt;a href=\"SS%20Fenella%20%281881%29\"&gt;\"Fenella\"&lt;/a&gt;, and then proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Harbour\"&gt;Douglas Harbour&lt;/a&gt; under her own power.\nNo apparent damage could be seen so \"Peel Castle\" left &lt;a href=\"Douglas%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Douglas&lt;/a&gt; the following day, bound for the &lt;a href=\"Drydock%23Graving\"&gt;Graving Dock&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Cammell%20Laird\"&gt;Cammell Laird's&lt;/a&gt; in order to be inspected by representatives of &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%27s%20of%20London\"&gt;Lloyd's of London&lt;/a&gt;. No damage was found on the subsequent inspection, and \"Peel Castle\" returned to service.\nDisposal.\n\"Peel Castle\" was retired after a service life of 45 years. She was broken up at &lt;a href=\"Dalmuir\"&gt;Dalmuir&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Clyde\"&gt;Clyde&lt;/a&gt; in February 1939."
