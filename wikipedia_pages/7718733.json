    "text": "Julio Navarro Ventura (January 9, 1934 \u2013 January 24, 2018) was a &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"relief%20pitcher\"&gt;relief pitcher&lt;/a&gt;. He played for the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels\"&gt;Los Angeles Angels&lt;/a&gt; (1962\u201364), &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Tigers\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; (1964\u201366), and &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt; (1970).\nThe 5'11\", 190\u00a0lb. right-hander with the nickname \"Whiplash\" was acquired by the Angels from the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt; organization on September 2, 1962. Navarro made his major league debut in relief on September 3, 1962 against the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; in game 2 of a &lt;a href=\"doubleheader%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubleheader&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Yankee%20Stadium\"&gt;Yankee Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. He pitched three &lt;a href=\"inning\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt;s and gave up two &lt;a href=\"earned%20runs\"&gt;earned runs&lt;/a&gt; in the 6\u20135 Angels victory. He struck out one batter, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Maris\"&gt;Roger Maris&lt;/a&gt;. He won his first &lt;a href=\"MLB\"&gt;major league&lt;/a&gt; game the very next day with 1.1 scoreless innings against New York. He retired &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Richardson\"&gt;Bobby Richardson&lt;/a&gt; to end the 8th, L.A. scored in the top of the 9th, and then he got Roger Maris, &lt;a href=\"Elston%20Howard\"&gt;Elston Howard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Blanchard\"&gt;Johnny Blanchard&lt;/a&gt; to close out the game. He pitched seven more games that month, ending with a 4.70 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;ERA&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next season, 1963, was Navarro's best statistically. He teamed with 40-year-old &lt;a href=\"Art%20Fowler\"&gt;Art Fowler&lt;/a&gt; to give the Angels a pair of dependable closers. Navarro finished in the &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; top ten for &lt;a href=\"games%20pitched\"&gt;games pitched&lt;/a&gt; (57), &lt;a href=\"save%20%28sport%29\"&gt;saves&lt;/a&gt; (12), and &lt;a href=\"games%20finished\"&gt;games finished&lt;/a&gt; (30). He was 4\u20135 with an ERA of 2.89.\nNavarro began the 1964 season in excellent fashion. He relieved in five games for the Angels with a 1.93 ERA, then was traded to the Detroit Tigers for &lt;a href=\"outfielder\"&gt;outfielder&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Smith%20%28outfielder%29\"&gt;Willie Smith&lt;/a&gt; on April 28. He was never the same after that, pitching decently for Detroit but not with the degree of effectiveness he had shown with Los Angeles. He was out of the big leagues after 1966 but returned in 1970 to make 17 appearances for the Atlanta Braves.\nCareer totals include a 7\u20139 record in 130 games, 1 &lt;a href=\"games%20started\"&gt;game started&lt;/a&gt;, 66 games finished, 17 saves, and an ERA of 3.65. He had 151 &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt;s in 212.1 &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings pitched&lt;/a&gt; for a 6.40 &lt;a href=\"K/9IP\"&gt;K/9IP&lt;/a&gt;, higher than the major league average during his era. Very good defensively, he handled 49 out of 50 &lt;a href=\"total%20chances\"&gt;total chances&lt;/a&gt; successfully for a &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt; of .980.\nHe is the father of former major league pitcher &lt;a href=\"Jaime%20Navarro\"&gt;Jaime Navarro&lt;/a&gt;.\nNavarro died peacefully January 24, 2018 in Orlando, Florida surrounded by his beloved wife and children."
