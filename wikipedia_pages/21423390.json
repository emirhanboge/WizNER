    "text": "Michael J. Homer (February 24, 1958 \u2013 February 1, 2009) was an American electronics and computer industry executive who played major roles in the development of the &lt;a href=\"personal%20computer\"&gt;personal computer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mobile%20device\"&gt;mobile device&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Internet\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife and career.\nHomer was born in &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; on February 24, 1958 and was awarded a bachelor's degree at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley\"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was hired by &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Inc.\"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt; in 1982, where he served as the technology adviser to the firm's chief executive, &lt;a href=\"John%20Sculley\"&gt;John Sculley&lt;/a&gt;. He followed with a position as marketing vice president at &lt;a href=\"GO%20Corp.\"&gt;GO Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, an early pioneer in creating software for mobile computers and personal digital assistants that did early work in pen-based computing.\nAfter Go closed in 1994, &lt;a href=\"John%20Doerr\"&gt;John Doerr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kleiner%20Perkins%20Caufield%20%26amp%3B%20Byers\"&gt;Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers&lt;/a&gt;, Go's main &lt;a href=\"venture%20capital\"&gt;venture capital&lt;/a&gt; backer, made the connection for Homer at &lt;a href=\"Marc%20Andreessen\"&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Netscape\"&gt;Netscape Communications Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. Homer was a vice president at the Netscape in the 1990s at the dawn of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Wide%20Web\"&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;. There, Homer developed the company's initial &lt;a href=\"business%20plan\"&gt;business plan&lt;/a&gt; and played a pivotal role in obtaining the private financing necessary to allow the company to progress to its 1995 &lt;a href=\"initial%20public%20offering\"&gt;initial public offering&lt;/a&gt;. He developed marketing plans for Netscape in 1994 at a time when few people had ever heard of the Internet. During the period where &lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; challenged Netscape's early browser dominance with its &lt;a href=\"Internet%20Explorer\"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; product, Homer headed the firm's marketing department as it faced bitter competition from Microsoft, a challenge that ultimately resulted in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20v.%20Microsoft\"&gt;an antitrust suit&lt;/a&gt;. Homer helped argue that Microsoft had abused its monopoly power in the operating system market to push out Netscape's browser in favor of its own.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"AOL\"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt;'s acquisition of Netscape in 2000, Homer founded &lt;a href=\"Kontiki%20%28company%29\"&gt;Kontiki&lt;/a&gt;, a peer-assisted content delivery technology company, that was purchased by &lt;a href=\"VeriSign\"&gt;VeriSign&lt;/a&gt; in March 2006 for $62 million, with a proviso that the rights to use the firm's technology would be donated to the non-profit &lt;a href=\"Open%20Media%20Network\"&gt;Open Media Network&lt;/a&gt;. Homer fostered the early growth of a series of technology firms, including roles in the development of &lt;a href=\"Google\"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tellme%20Networks\"&gt;Tellme Networks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"TiVo\"&gt;TiVo&lt;/a&gt;, and sat on the board of &lt;a href=\"Palm%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Palm, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;\nIllness.\nIn 2007, persistent memory problems he had been experiencing led to a diagnosis of &lt;a href=\"Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob%20disease\"&gt;Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease&lt;/a&gt;, a very rare and incurable &lt;a href=\"degeneration%20%28medical%29\"&gt;degenerative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"neurological%20disorder\"&gt;neurological disorder&lt;/a&gt;. Several people close to him created \"Fight for Mike\", an organization that raised $7 million used to fund research in the neurology department of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20San%20Francisco\"&gt;University of California, San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; towards study and potential cure of the disease. The team at UCSF includes Dr. &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20B.%20Prusiner\"&gt;Stanley B. Prusiner&lt;/a&gt;, winner of the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine\"&gt;Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 for his discovery of the &lt;a href=\"prion\"&gt;prion&lt;/a&gt;, misfolded proteins that trigger CJD and &lt;a href=\"bovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy\"&gt;bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; (\"mad cow disease\"). The team at UCSF was studying the use of &lt;a href=\"Quinacrine\"&gt;Quinacrine&lt;/a&gt;, long used as an &lt;a href=\"antimalarial%20drug\"&gt;antimalarial drug&lt;/a&gt;, in the treatment of CJD.\nHomer died at age 50 on February 1, 2009 in &lt;a href=\"Atherton%2C%20California\"&gt;Atherton, California&lt;/a&gt;. He was survived by his wife, three children, his mother and sister. The science center at &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Heart%20Schools%2C%20Atherton\"&gt;Sacred Heart Schools, Atherton&lt;/a&gt; is named after him."
