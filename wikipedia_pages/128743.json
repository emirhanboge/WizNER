    "text": "Tidaholm Municipality (\"Tidaholms kommun\") is a &lt;a href=\"municipalities%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4stra%20G%C3%B6taland%20County\"&gt;V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County&lt;/a&gt; in western &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. Its seat is located in the &lt;a href=\"stad%20%28Sweden%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tidaholm\"&gt;Tidaholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe municipality is located on the banks of the &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tidan%20%28river%29\"&gt;Tidan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early 1970s a nationwide local government reform was carried out in Sweden. Urban and rural areas were merged into larger unitary municipalities. The former \"City of Tidaholm\" (instituted in 1910) was in 1974 amalgamated with the surrounding rural municipality H\u00f6kens\u00e5s and parts of Dimbo and Fr\u00f6jered. The number of original entities (as of 1863) within the present municipality is 20.\nMany well-preserved &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; churches stand in the municipality. Some church sites also contain examples of early &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s."
