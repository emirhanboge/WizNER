    "text": "Fudbalski klub Sloga Stari Bar is a &lt;a href=\"Montenegro\"&gt;Montenegrin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in the town of &lt;a href=\"Stari%20Bar\"&gt;Stari Bar&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Bar%2C%20Montenegro\"&gt;Bar&lt;/a&gt;. They currently compete in the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20Third%20League\"&gt;Montenegrin Third League&lt;/a&gt; - South.\nHistory.\nFK Sloga was founded in 1926, as FK \"Orao\" (Eagle), in &lt;a href=\"Stari%20Bar\"&gt;Stari Bar&lt;/a&gt; (the Old town of &lt;a href=\"Bar%2C%20Montenegro\"&gt;Bar&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn the first decades (1926-1941), FK Orao played mostly exhibition matches, with the popular local rivalry with &lt;a href=\"FK%20Mornar\"&gt;FK Mornar&lt;/a&gt; (at that time named as \"JSK Crnojevi\u0107\"), with a few seasons in the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20Football%20Championship%20%281922-1940%29\"&gt;Montenegrin Football Championship (1922-1940)&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1946 until now, under the new name - \"Sloga\", the club played only in the lowest-rank competition. In the period between1961-1968, FK Sloga played in the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20clubs%20in%20Yugoslav%20football%20competitions%20%281946%E2%80%932006%29%23Montenegrin%20regional%20league%20system\"&gt;Fourth League - South&lt;/a&gt;. In 1968, the club was dissolved, but it was refounded in 1984. After that, FK Sloga continued to play in the Fourth League.\nSince 2006, Sloga is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20Third%20League\"&gt;Montenegrin Third League&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a finalist of the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20Regional%20Cups\"&gt;Southern Region Cup&lt;/a&gt;, FK Sloga played in the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20Cup\"&gt;Montenegrin Cup&lt;/a&gt; seasons 2008\u201309, 2009\u201310, 2015\u201316 and 2016\u201317.\nStadium.\nBecause there is no football pitch in Stari Bar, FK Sloga plays its important home games at &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Topolica\"&gt;Stadion Topolica&lt;/a&gt; in Bar, whose capacity is 2,500 seats. The stadium is built at the coast of &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt;, near the city beach and &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Bar\"&gt;Port of Bar&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium has floodlights, and except football, it's the main athletic field in Montenegro. For other matches, FK Sloga is using the smaller stadium at the Topolica Sports Complex, whose capacity is 1,000 seats."
