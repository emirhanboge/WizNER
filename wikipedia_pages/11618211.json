    "text": "The George Sturges House is a single-family &lt;a href=\"house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, designed by architect &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright\"&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright&lt;/a&gt; and built for George D. Sturges in the Brentwood Heights neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Brentwood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Brentwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. Designed and built in 1939, the one-story residence is fairly small compared to 21st century standards, 1,200 square feet (110\u00a0m2), but features a 21-foot panoramic deck. The home is made out of &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"brick\"&gt;brick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Redwood\"&gt;redwood&lt;/a&gt;. Wright hired &lt;a href=\"Taliesin%20%28studio%29\"&gt;Taliesin&lt;/a&gt; fellow &lt;a href=\"John%20Lautner%20%28architect%29\"&gt;John Lautner&lt;/a&gt; to oversee its construction.\nThe Sturges House is the only structure in &lt;a href=\"Southern%20California\"&gt;Southern California&lt;/a&gt; built in the modern style Wright called &lt;a href=\"Usonia\"&gt;Usonia&lt;/a&gt;n design. Other Wright homes in the area were built in the 1920s with interlocking, pre-cast concrete blocks, which he named \"textile block\" style, and seen in such homes as the &lt;a href=\"Ennis%20House\"&gt;Ennis House&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe house was owned by actor &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Larson\"&gt;Jack Larson&lt;/a&gt;. After his death in 2015 the house was to be put up for auction, with the proceeds to benefit the nonprofit Bridges/Larson Foundation. In February 2016 Los Angeles Modern Auctions announced that no qualified bidder had registered, and it was withdrawn. \nThe George Sturges House can be viewed easily from the street (449 N. Skyewiay Road). It was designated as Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #577 on May 25, 1993."
