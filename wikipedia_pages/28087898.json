    "text": "Two human polls comprised the &lt;a href=\"1952%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;1952&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (NCAA) football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a &lt;a href=\"national%20championship\"&gt;national championship&lt;/a&gt;, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason\u2014the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Poll\"&gt;AP Poll&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Coaches%27%20Poll\"&gt;Coaches' Poll&lt;/a&gt;.\nAP Poll.\nThe final AP Poll was released on December 1, at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1952%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;1952 regular season&lt;/a&gt;, weeks before the major bowls. The AP would not release a post-bowl season final poll regularly until &lt;a href=\"1968%20NCAA%20University%20Division%20football%20rankings\"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinal Coaches' Poll.\nThe final &lt;a href=\"United%20Press\"&gt;UP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Coaches%20Poll\"&gt;Coaches Poll&lt;/a&gt; was released prior to the bowl games, on \n&lt;br&gt;Michigan State received 32 of the 35 first-place votes; one each went to Georgia Tech, Notre Dame, and Oklahoma."
