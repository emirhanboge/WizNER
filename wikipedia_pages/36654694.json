    "text": "Silent Heaven is a compilation album by composer &lt;a href=\"C.W.%20Vrtacek\"&gt;C.W. Vrtacek&lt;/a&gt;, released on March 12, 1996 through &lt;a href=\"Cuneiform%20Records\"&gt;Cuneiform Records&lt;/a&gt;. It comprises two of Vrtacek's out-of-print records, \"&lt;a href=\"Learning%20to%20Be%20Silent\"&gt;Learning to Be Silent&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"When%20Heaven%20Comes%20to%20Town\"&gt;When Heaven Comes to Town&lt;/a&gt;\".\nRelease and reception.\n&lt;a href=\"Allmusic\"&gt;Allmusic&lt;/a&gt; critic Fran\u00e7ois Couture found Vrtacek's work to be \"very aerial\" and that \"one can't help but think of &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Hackett\"&gt;Steve Hackett's&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Bay of Kings&lt;/a&gt;\": simple songs with beautiful melodies.\" He gave \"Silent Heaven\" three out of five stars, noting that \"some will perceive it as lacking sustenance, but it is refreshing to hear Vrtacek away from the surf guitar licks.\""
