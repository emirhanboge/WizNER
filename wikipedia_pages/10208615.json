Long simmering rage ignited the city that was fueled by other problems. Within hours, storefronts were ablaze, and teenagers pelted police cruisers with rocks and bottles. Snipers held police and firefighters at bay. Fearing the violence would turn into another riot situation similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Watts%20Riots\"&gt;Watts, California&lt;/a&gt;, Sheriff Beard asked Governor Claude Kirk to call out the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20National%20Guard\"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt;.

Beard was convinced by black leaders to allow groups of their own to quell the rioters, and within two days, Beard declared the riots were over.\nMisconduct.\nIn 2006, sheriff's deputies, along with other law enforcement agencies arrested 52 members of the Caribbean American Club on racketeering charges.

In 2013, the department agreed to pay $260,000 to ten of those arrested as compensation.\nIn 2007, Deputy Roosevelt Givens began a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old girl. In 2012 the deputy was allowed to resign.

Surveillance video showed Sterner tumbling to the floor and officers searching his clothing as he lay prone. The deputy later resigned and was charged with felony abuse on a disabled person after the video was publicized. Charges were dropped when she agreed to a plea deal which she agrees to never work in law enforcement again and does 100 hours of community service with the disabled. Several other deputies were suspended without pay and one supervisor was fired for not reporting the incident.\nOn 11 September 2008, a mentally ill man was hog-tied by three sheriff's deputies and subjected to a number of electrical shocks. The local medical examiner said that Roney Wilson died as a result of \"delirium with agitation due to schizoaffective disorder.\" The death was the subject of a civil lawsuit.\nIn 2008, sheriff's deputies and officers from the Temple Terrace Police Department lied on official documents regarding a routine arrest for driving under the influence. Deputy James Glover falsely attested the correct procedures had been followed. When the defense attorney asked for the video of the incident, he discovered the tapes had been altered by officials.\nLine of duty deaths.\n17 Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office deputies died while they were actively employed by the sheriff's office.
