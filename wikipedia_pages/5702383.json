After finishing 11th in 1991 they were entitled to enter the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Russian Top Division&lt;/a&gt; formed after the dissolution of the USSR. In 1993 Tekstilshchik finished fourth in the league, achieving the best result in the club's history. In 1996\u20131997 the club suffered two consecutive relegations (17th in Top Division in 1996, 19th in &lt;a href=\"Russian%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; in 1997). They were then excluded from the Second Division Volga Zone midway through the 1998 season for not paying their participation fee, thereby dropping into the fourth-level &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Amateur%20Football%20League\"&gt;KFK (Amateur) League&lt;/a&gt;.

However, 2005\u20132007 brought three consecutive last-place finishes, the third of which saw them relegated back to the Amateur League. Prior to the 2009 season the club voluntarily withdrew from the national football pyramid by the decision of &lt;a href=\"Kamyshin\"&gt;Kamyshin&lt;/a&gt; mayor Aleksandr Chunakov, and instead entered the &lt;a href=\"Volgograd%20Oblast%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;Volgograd Oblast Championship&lt;/a&gt; (nominally the fifth level, but with no automatic promotion to the Amateur League). They remain there as of 2015.\nTekstilshchik participated in the UEFA Cup in &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%201994-95\"&gt;1994\u201395&lt;/a&gt;, beating Hungarians &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9k%C3%A9scsaba%201912%20El%C5%91re%20SE\"&gt;Bekescsabai Elore&lt;/a&gt; to reach the second round where they lost to &lt;a href=\"FC%20Nantes\"&gt;FC Nantes&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeam name history.\n\"Tekstilshchik\" is a nickname meaning \"the textile workers\" or \"the weavers\".\nReserve squad.\nTekstilshchik's reserve squad played professionally as FC Tekstilshchik-d Kamyshin (&lt;a href=\"Russian%20Second%20League\"&gt;Russian Second League&lt;/a&gt; in 1992) and FC Energiya-d Kamyshin (&lt;a href=\"Russian%20Third%20League\"&gt;Russian Third League&lt;/a&gt; in 1997).\nNotable past players.\nHad international caps for their respective countries.
