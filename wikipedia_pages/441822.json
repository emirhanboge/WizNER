    "text": "Psilocybe ( ) is a &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of gilled &lt;a href=\"mushrooms\"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;, growing worldwide, in the family &lt;a href=\"Hymenogastraceae\"&gt;Hymenogastraceae&lt;/a&gt;. Most or nearly all species contain the &lt;a href=\"Psychedelic%20drug\"&gt;psychedelic&lt;/a&gt; compounds &lt;a href=\"Psilocybin\"&gt;Psilocybin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"psilocin\"&gt;psilocin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"baeocystin\"&gt;baeocystin&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThe genus name \"Psilocybe\" is a compound of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; elements \u03c8\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 (\"psil\u00f3s\") \"bare\" / \"naked\" and \u03ba\u03cd\u03b2\u03b7 (\"k\u00fabe\") \"head\" / \"swelling\", giving the meaning \"bare-headed\" (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Hair%20loss\"&gt;bald&lt;/a&gt;) referring to the mushroom's detachable pellicle (loose skin over the cap), which can resemble a bald pate.\nDescription.\n\"Psilocybe\" &lt;a href=\"basidiocarp\"&gt;fruit bodies&lt;/a&gt; are typically small, nondescript mushrooms with a typical \"&lt;a href=\"little%20brown%20mushroom\"&gt;little brown mushroom&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Morphology%20%28biology%29\"&gt;morphology&lt;/a&gt;. Macroscopically, they are characterized by their small to occasionally medium size, brown to yellow-brown coloration, with a typically &lt;a href=\"hygrophanous\"&gt;hygrophanous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pileus%20%28mycology%29\"&gt;cap&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"spore%20print\"&gt;spore print&lt;/a&gt;-color that ranges from lilac-brown to dark purple-brown (though rusty-brown colored varieties are known in at least one species). Hallucinogenic species typically have a blue-staining reaction when the fruit body is bruised. Microscopically, they are characterized by &lt;a href=\"pileipellis\"&gt;pileipellis&lt;/a&gt; with hyphae that run parallel to the pileus surface, forming a \"cutis\", by their lack of &lt;a href=\"chrysocystidia\"&gt;chrysocystidia&lt;/a&gt;, and by &lt;a href=\"spore\"&gt;spore&lt;/a&gt;s that are smooth, ellipsoid to rhomboid to subhexagonal in shape, with a distinct apical &lt;a href=\"germ%20pore\"&gt;germ pore&lt;/a&gt;. Ecologically, all species of \"Psilocybe\" are &lt;a href=\"saprotrophs\"&gt;saprotrophs&lt;/a&gt;, growing on various kinds of decaying organic matter.\nClassification.\nA 2002 study of the &lt;a href=\"molecular%20phylogeny\"&gt;molecular phylogeny&lt;/a&gt; of the agarics indicated that the genus \"Psilocybe\" as then defined was &lt;a href=\"polyphyletic\"&gt;polyphyletic&lt;/a&gt;, falling into two distinct &lt;a href=\"clades\"&gt;clades&lt;/a&gt; that are not directly related to each other. The blue-staining hallucinogenic species constituted one clade and the non-bluing species the other. The previous &lt;a href=\"Type%20%28botany%29\"&gt;type species&lt;/a&gt; (\"Psilocybe \") of the genus was in the non-bluing clade, but in 2010 the type species was changed to \"&lt;a href=\"Psilocybe%20semilanceata\"&gt;Psilocybe semilanceata&lt;/a&gt;\", a member of the bluing clade. A 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of the &lt;a href=\"Agaricales\"&gt;Agaricales&lt;/a&gt; by Matheny and colleagues, further demonstrated the separation of the bluing and non-bluing clades of \"Psilocybe\" in a larger, strongly supported phylogenetic tree of the Agaricales.\n\"Psilocybe\" had been placed &lt;a href=\"Taxonomy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;taxonomically&lt;/a&gt; in the agaric family &lt;a href=\"Strophariaceae\"&gt;Strophariaceae&lt;/a&gt; based upon its &lt;a href=\"basidiospore\"&gt;spore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pileipellis\"&gt;pileipellis&lt;/a&gt; morphology. The phylogenetic study by Matheny \"et al.\", placed the non-bluing \"Psilocybe\" and its close relatives in a &lt;a href=\"basal%20%28phylogenetics%29\"&gt;basal&lt;/a&gt; position within the Strophariaceae, a &lt;a href=\"Cladistics%23Introduction\"&gt;sister taxon&lt;/a&gt; to a clade containing the other genera within that family. The bluing \"Psilocybe\", however, form a clade that is sister to \"&lt;a href=\"Galerina\"&gt;Galerina&lt;/a&gt;\" in the newly revised family, &lt;a href=\"Hymenogastraceae\"&gt;Hymenogastraceae&lt;/a&gt; that used to be restricted to secotioid, false-truffles. The phylogenetic study by Moncalvo, \"et al.\" confirmed that the agaric genus \"Melanotus\" is simply a subgroup of the non-bluing \"Psilocybe\", all of which are placed in \"&lt;a href=\"Deconica\"&gt;Deconica&lt;/a&gt;\", and also pointed to a close relationship between the latter genus and the genera \"&lt;a href=\"Kuehneromyces\"&gt;Kuehneromyces&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Phaeogalera\"&gt;Phaeogalera&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2007, a paper by Redhead \"et al.\" proposed &lt;a href=\"conserved%20name\"&gt;conserving&lt;/a&gt; the genus \"Psilocybe\" with \"Psilocybe semilanceata\" as its type species. The suggestion was accepted by unanimous vote of the &lt;a href=\"Nomenclature%20Committee%20for%20Fungi\"&gt;Nomenclature Committee for Fungi&lt;/a&gt; of the International Botanical Congress in 2010, meaning that \"P.\u00a0semilanceata\" (a member of the bluing clade) now serves as the type species of the genus. Since \"P.\u00a0semilanceata\" is now the type species of the genus, the bluing hallucinogenic clade remained in the genus \"Psilocybe\" (&lt;a href=\"Hymenogastraceae\"&gt;Hymenogastraceae&lt;/a&gt;) while the non-bluing clade were transferred to the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Deconica\"&gt;Deconica&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Strophariaceae\"&gt;Strophariaceae&lt;/a&gt;). However, it has been demonstrated that \"&lt;a href=\"Psilocybe%20fuscofulva\"&gt;Psilocybe fuscofulva&lt;/a&gt;\", a species that used to be known as \"Psilocybe atrobrunnea\", belongs to the genus \"Psilocybe\" s.s. but does not contain psychotropic compounds.\nDistribution and habitat.\nGeographically, species in this genus are found throughout the world in most &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. The greatest species diversity seems to be in the &lt;a href=\"neotropics\"&gt;neotropics&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerica\"&gt;Mesoamerica&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;. \"Psilocybe\" are found in a variety of &lt;a href=\"habitat\"&gt;habitat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Substrate%20%28biology%29\"&gt;substrate&lt;/a&gt;s. Many of the species found in &lt;a href=\"temperate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; regions, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Psilocybe%20cyanescens\"&gt;Psilocybe cyanescens&lt;/a&gt;\", seem to have an affinity for &lt;a href=\"Landscaping\"&gt;landscaped&lt;/a&gt; areas &lt;a href=\"mulch\"&gt;mulch&lt;/a&gt;ed with &lt;a href=\"woodchips\"&gt;woodchips&lt;/a&gt; and are actually rather rare in natural settings removed from human habitation. Contrary to popular belief, only a minority of \"Psilocybe\" species, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Psilocybe%20cubensis\"&gt;P.\u00a0cubensis&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Psilocybe%20subcubensis\"&gt;P.\u00a0subcubensis&lt;/a&gt;\", grow directly on &lt;a href=\"feces\"&gt;feces&lt;/a&gt;. Many other species are found in habitats such as &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;y, &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;y, or &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"humus\"&gt;humus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"soil\"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPsychoactivity.\nBiochemistry and pharmacology.\nThe &lt;a href=\"psilocybin\"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; molecule is indirectly responsible for the hallucinogenic properties of the \"Psilocybe\". This compound, as well as all other &lt;a href=\"indole\"&gt;indole&lt;/a&gt; alkaloids, are derived from the amino acid &lt;a href=\"tryptophan\"&gt;tryptophan&lt;/a&gt;, being the only amino acid with the indole-amine ring. Tryptophan is converted to &lt;a href=\"tryptamine\"&gt;tryptamine&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"decarboxylation\"&gt;decarboxylation&lt;/a&gt;. Two methylation steps occur producing &lt;a href=\"Dimethyltryptamine\"&gt;DMT&lt;/a&gt;, another psychedelic compound. Hydroxylation of this compound produces the more potent hallucinogen &lt;a href=\"psilocin\"&gt;psilocin&lt;/a&gt;, followed by phosphorylation yielding &lt;a href=\"psilocybin\"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt;. After ingestion of the psilocybin compound &lt;a href=\"alkaline%20phosphatase\"&gt;alkaline phosphatase&lt;/a&gt;s present in the body's digestive system, kidneys, and possibly in the blood readily cleave the phosphoryl ester bond from psilocybin, yielding the hydroxyl compound, psilocin. Psilocin is the chemical primarily responsible for the hallucinogenic effects of the \"Psilocybe\". The blue-staining species of \"Psilocybe\" are characterized by the presence of psilocin and psilocybin. This blue-staining reaction occurs after the fruit body has been injured, particularly near the base of the stalk. This reaction is thought to be due to the &lt;a href=\"oxidation\"&gt;oxidation&lt;/a&gt; of psilocybin after the outer surface of the fruit body has been breached. The degree of bluing in a \"Psilocybe\" fruit body roughly correlates with the concentration of psilocin in the mushroom. Psilocybin is chemically far more stable than psilocin, the latter compound being largely lost when the mushroom is heated or dried.\nThe chemical structure of &lt;a href=\"serotonin\"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt;, an innate indole alkaloid &lt;a href=\"neurotransmitter\"&gt;neurotransmitter&lt;/a&gt; that regulates our mood and therefore happiness, is nearly identical to that of psilocin. The latter differing mainly by the hydroxyl group moving one carbon and the addition of two methyl groups that make the molecule &lt;a href=\"lipophilic\"&gt;lipophilic&lt;/a&gt; (fat soluble), ergo capable of crossing the &lt;a href=\"lipid%20membrane\"&gt;lipid membrane&lt;/a&gt; sheaths of the &lt;a href=\"central%20nervous%20system\"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt;. After psilocybin has been ingested and dephosphorylated, to psilocin, the mechanism it uses in the brain has a direct agonist effect on the 5-HT &lt;a href=\"serotonin%20receptor\"&gt;serotonin receptor&lt;/a&gt;s. To explain this effect, the psilocin molecule essentially mimics the serotonin molecule, binding to the 5-HT receptors and initiating the same response as the serotonin. This effect explains the euphoria experienced by ingestion of this \"agonist.\" Initially, hallucinogens were thought to blockade these serotonin neurotransmitters, but persistent research led to this agonist effect conclusion.\nWoolley and Campbell conducted research to determine whether the depletion of the hormone serotonin had a direct effect on mental disorders and that hallucinations might be due to an excess of serotonin. Their results led them to study chemicals analogous to serotonin. They found that the psychoactive chemicals psilocybin and psilocin exhibited serotonin-like effects, however as dosage increased, these compounds acted as serotonin antagonists, psilocybin being comparable to the most potent antagonist yet discovered. This is a plausible basis for the psychological effects of these hallucinogenic compounds.\nEven though these chemicals are psychoactive and therefore the &lt;a href=\"basidiomycete\"&gt;basidiomycete&lt;/a&gt; deemed toxic, there have been no reports of fatalities or induced internal organ damage directly associated with ingestion of these chemicals. Misidentification of the fruit body could lead to ingestion of a lethal fungus.\nSome psychoactive species contain &lt;a href=\"baeocystin\"&gt;baeocystin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"norbaeocystin\"&gt;norbaeocystin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beta-Carboline\"&gt;\u03b2\u2010carboline&lt;/a&gt; monoamine oxidase inhibitors in addition to psilocin and psilocybin.\nMedical and psychiatric aspects.\nThe medicinal uses of the \"Psilocybe\" was recorded by Native Americans of Central America. Shamans, or &lt;a href=\"curandera\"&gt;curandera&lt;/a&gt;s would avidly ingest the \"sacred mushrooms\" for the extrasensory perceptual effects it gave them in order to better assess problems faced in their society. The observed effects of the alkaloids found in these mushrooms has given rise to research into their possible uses for psychiatric medicine.\nFor details on contemporary research, see: &lt;a href=\"Psilocybin%23Medical%20research\"&gt;Psilocybin: Medical research&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory and ethnography.\nHallucinogenic species of \"Psilocybe\" have a long history of use among the native peoples of Mesoamerica for religious communion, divination, and healing, from &lt;a href=\"pre-Columbian\"&gt;pre-Columbian&lt;/a&gt; times up to the present day. Hallucinogenic \"Psilocybe\" were known to the aboriginal &lt;a href=\"Mexicans\"&gt;Mexicans&lt;/a&gt; as \"teonan\u00e1catl\" (literally \"divine mushroom\") and were reportedly served at the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Moctezuma%20II\"&gt;Moctezuma II&lt;/a&gt; in 1502. After the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20conquest%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Spanish conquest of the Americas&lt;/a&gt;, the use of hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms, like other pre-&lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; traditions, was forcibly suppressed and driven underground.\nBy the 20th century, hallucinogenic mushroom use was thought by non-&lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; to have disappeared entirely. However, in 1955, &lt;a href=\"Valentina%20Pavlovna%20Wasson\"&gt;Valentina Wasson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Gordon%20Wasson\"&gt;R. Gordon Wasson&lt;/a&gt; became the first &lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;Westerner&lt;/a&gt;s to actively participate in an indigenous mushroom ceremony. The Wassons did much to publicize their discovery, even publishing an article on their experiences in \"&lt;a href=\"Life%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1957. In 1956, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Heim\"&gt;Roger Heim&lt;/a&gt; identified the hallucinogenic mushroom that the Wassons had brought back from Mexico as \"Psilocybe\" and in 1958, &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Hofmann\"&gt;Albert Hofmann&lt;/a&gt; first reported psilocin and psilocybin as the active compound in these mushrooms. There is some skepticism as to whether or not these \"sacred mushrooms\" were actually in the genus \"Psilocybe\". However, according to Heim's research in Mexico, he identified three species of \"Psilocybe\" that he believed were used in these native ceremonies. The species identified by Heim were; \"Psilocybe mexicana, P. caerulescens\", and \"P. zapotecorum\". are a variety of \"Psilocybe\" mushrooms that make up the \"teonan\u00e1catl\" group of hallucinogenic mushrooms, including \"Psilocybe cubensis\". Isauro Nava Garcia, a Mazotec man, provided guidance to Heim while Heim conducted his field and culture work. Garcia was an avid observer of the fungi in his environment while identifying specific characteristics about the fruit body of the \"Psilocybe\" his ancestors utilized, as well as knowing where they could be found.\nAt present, hallucinogenic mushroom use has been reported among a number of groups spanning from central Mexico to Oaxaca, including groups of &lt;a href=\"Nahua%20peoples\"&gt;Nahua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mixtecs\"&gt;Mixtecs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mixe%20people\"&gt;Mixe&lt;/a&gt;, Mazatecs, &lt;a href=\"Zapotec%20peoples\"&gt;Zapotecs&lt;/a&gt;, and others.\nThe popularization of &lt;a href=\"entheogens\"&gt;entheogens&lt;/a&gt; by Wasson, &lt;a href=\"Timothy%20Leary\"&gt;Timothy Leary&lt;/a&gt;, and others has led to an explosion in the use of hallucinogenic \"Psilocybe\" throughout the world. By the early 1970s, a number of psychoactive \"Psilocybe\" species were described from temperate North America, Europe, and Asia and were widely collected. Books describing methods of cultivating \"&lt;a href=\"Psilocybe%20cubensis\"&gt;Psilocybe cubensis&lt;/a&gt;\" in large quantities were also published. The relatively easy availability of hallucinogenic \"Psilocybe\" from wild and cultivated sources has made it among the most widely used of the &lt;a href=\"hallucinogenic%20drugs\"&gt;hallucinogenic drugs&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegal status.\nThe purified chemicals psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Schedule I drugs under the United Nations 1971 &lt;a href=\"Convention%20on%20Psychotropic%20Substances\"&gt;Convention on Psychotropic Substances&lt;/a&gt;. However, the UN drug treaties do not apply to cultivation, preparation, or international transport of psilocybin mushrooms.\nInternationally, the two chemicals are generally considered controlled substances. However, there is much ambiguity about what is considered a \"container\" of these compounds in several countries (e.g. Brazil), the chemicals themselves are listed as controlled substances, but the mushrooms that contain the chemicals are not, therefore deemed legal.\nIn the United States, possession of \"Psilocybe\" mushroom fruiting bodies is illegal in every state except for Florida. This is because the Supreme Court of Florida does not believe that these mushrooms could \"reasonably be found to be containers of the schedule I substance, psilocybin\".\nIn the United States there is no federal law mentioning the possession of \"Psilocybe\" spores, this is because only the psilocybin and psilocin compounds are considered Schedule I drugs and there is no presence of these compounds in the spores themselves, only in the fruiting body of the cultivated spores. However, there are several US states that have actually prohibited possession of these spores because they can be cultivated to produce these hallucinogenic, Schedule I drugs. These states includes California, Georgia, and Idaho.\nHowever, possession of the spores by a qualified mycologist in California is legal if being put to use for research purposes, which must be approved by Research Advisory Panel. If not authorized by law, possession of spores or cultivation of fruiting bodies of the \"Psilocybe\" is punishable to not more than one year in county jail or state prison.\nPsilocybin mushrooms as well as other \"soft drugs\" which are stronger than cannabis but not synthetic, are legally available through &lt;a href=\"smart%20shop\"&gt;smart shop&lt;/a&gt;s in The Netherlands. Only the &lt;a href=\"sclerotium\"&gt;truffle&lt;/a&gt; form of magic mushrooms (such as \"&lt;a href=\"Psilocybe%20tampanensis\"&gt;Psilocybe tampanensis&lt;/a&gt;\") are currently legal, but these still contain the active ingredients and produce similar effect as the caps and stalks."
