    "text": "D\u00f9n is an island in &lt;a href=\"St%20Kilda%2C%20Scotland\"&gt;St Kilda&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland. It is nearly long. Its name simply means \"fort\" in &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Gaelic\"&gt;Scottish Gaelic&lt;/a&gt; (for more information, see \"&lt;a href=\"dun\"&gt;dun&lt;/a&gt;\"), but the fort itself has been lost \u2013 old maps show it on Gob an D\u00f9in (), which is at the seaward end.\nThough D\u00f9n is almost joined to &lt;a href=\"Hirta\"&gt;Hirta&lt;/a&gt; at Ruiaval, the two islands are separated by Caolas an D\u00f9in (the straits of D\u00f9n). This prevents &lt;a href=\"Soay%20sheep\"&gt;Soay sheep&lt;/a&gt; from Hirta straying onto the island, and thus it is more vegetated.\nThe small island is home to the largest colony of &lt;a href=\"fulmar\"&gt;fulmar&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;. Before 1828, St Kilda was their only &lt;a href=\"British%20Isles\"&gt;British Isles&lt;/a&gt; breeding ground, but they have since spread and established colonies elsewhere, such as at &lt;a href=\"Fowlsheugh\"&gt;Fowlsheugh&lt;/a&gt;.\nD\u00f9n, which protects Village Bay on Hirta from the prevailing south-westerly winds, was at one time joined to Hirta by a natural arch. MacLean (1972) suggests that the arch was broken when struck by a &lt;a href=\"galleon\"&gt;galleon&lt;/a&gt; fleeing the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Armada\"&gt;Armada&lt;/a&gt;, but other sources, such as Mitchell (1992), provide the more credible (if less romantic) explanation that the arch was simply swept away by one of the many fierce storms which batter the islands every winter."
