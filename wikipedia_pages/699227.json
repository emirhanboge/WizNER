    "text": "Mleccha (from &lt;a href=\"Vedic%20Sanskrit\"&gt;Vedic Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; \"\", meaning \"non-Vedic\", \"foreigner\" or \"&lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;\") is a &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; term referring to foreign or barbarous peoples in ancient &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, as contra-distinguished from &lt;a href=\"Aryan\"&gt;Aryas&lt;/a&gt;. \"Mleccha\" was used by the ancient Indians originally to indicate the uncouth and incomprehensible speech of foreigners and then extended to their unfamiliar behaviour, and also used as a derogatory term in the sense of \"impure\", \"impolite\", and/or \"inferior\" people.\nThe word Mleccha was commonly used for foreign 'barbarians of whatever race or colour'. As a \"mlechchha (or mleccha)\", any foreigner stood completely outside the caste system (which means they are outcastes) and the ritual ambience. The Vedic people consider the mlecchas as impure. Thus, historically, contact with them was viewed by the caste Hindu (&lt;a href=\"Savarna%20%28Hinduism%29\"&gt;Savarna Hindus&lt;/a&gt;) as polluting.\nThe Indians referred to all alien cultures and races in ancient times as 'Mleccha' or &lt;a href=\"barbarians\"&gt;barbarians&lt;/a&gt;. Among the tribes termed Mleccha were &lt;a href=\"Saka\"&gt;Saka&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Huna%20people\"&gt;Hunas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yavana\"&gt;Yavana&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Kambojas\"&gt;Kambojas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pahlavas\"&gt;Pahlavas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bahlikas\"&gt;Bahlikas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rishikas\"&gt;Rishikas&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Amarakosha\"&gt;Amarakosha&lt;/a&gt; described the &lt;a href=\"Kiratas\"&gt;Kiratas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khas\"&gt;Khas&lt;/a&gt;as and &lt;a href=\"Pulindas\"&gt;Pulindas&lt;/a&gt; as the Mleccha \"&lt;a href=\"J%C4%81tis\"&gt;J\u0101tis&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Indo-Greeks\"&gt;Indo-Greeks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scythians\"&gt;Scythians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kushanas\"&gt;Kushanas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arabs\"&gt;Arabs&lt;/a&gt; were also mlecchas.\nEtymology.\nThe Sanskrit word \"mleccha\" does not have a standard Indo-European etymology and has no counterpart in Iranian languages. However, it has cognates in Middle Indo-Aryan languages: &lt;a href=\"Pali\"&gt;Pali&lt;/a&gt; \"milakkha\", and &lt;a href=\"Prakrit\"&gt;Prakrit&lt;/a&gt; \"mliccha\", from the latter of which originate &lt;a href=\"Sindhi%20language\"&gt;Sindhi&lt;/a&gt; \"milis\", &lt;a href=\"Punjabi%20language\"&gt;Punjabi&lt;/a&gt; \"milech\", &lt;a href=\"Kashmiri%20language\"&gt;Kashmiri&lt;/a&gt; \"brichun\" (weep or lament), Western &lt;a href=\"Pahari%20language\"&gt;Pahari&lt;/a&gt; \"melech\" (dirty). The Sanskrit word occurs as a verb \"mlecchati\" for the first time in the latic Vedic text \"\u015aathapatha\u2010Br\u0101hmana\" dated to around 700 BCE. It is taken to mean \"to speak indistinctly or barbarously\". Brahmins are prohibited from speaking in this fashion.\nAs \"mleccha\" does not have an Indo-European etymology, scholars infer that it must have been a self-designation of a non-Aryan people within India. Based on the geographic references to the \"Mleccha de\u015ba\" (Mleccha country) to the west, the term is identified with the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20Valley%20Civilisation\"&gt;Indus&lt;/a&gt; people, whose land is known from the Sumerian texts as &lt;a href=\"Meluhha\"&gt;Melu\u1e2b\u1e2ba&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Asko%20Parpola\"&gt;Asko Parpola&lt;/a&gt; has proposed a &lt;a href=\"Dravidian%20languages\"&gt;Dravidian&lt;/a&gt; derivation for \"Melu\u1e2b\u1e2ba\", as \"mel-akam\" (\"high country\", a possible reference to the &lt;a href=\"Balochistan\"&gt;Balochistan&lt;/a&gt; high lands). &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Southworth\"&gt;Franklin Southworth&lt;/a&gt; suggests that mleccha comes from \"mizi\" meaning 'speak', or 'one's speech' derived from &lt;a href=\"Proto-Dravidian%20language\"&gt;Proto-Dravidian&lt;/a&gt; for language.\n&lt;a href=\"Pali\"&gt;Pali&lt;/a&gt;, the older &lt;a href=\"Prakrit\"&gt;Prakrit&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"Theravada\"&gt;Theravada&lt;/a&gt; Buddhism, uses the term \"milakkha\". It also employs \"milakkhu\", a borrowing from a &lt;a href=\"Dramatic%20Prakrit\"&gt;Dramatic Prakrit&lt;/a&gt;.\nLanguage.\nSome explanations of the name \"mleccha\" suggest that the word was derived from the &lt;a href=\"Indo-Iranians\"&gt;Indo-Aryan&lt;/a&gt; perception of the speech of the indigenous peoples. Namely, \"mlech\" was a word that meant \"to speak indistinctly.\" As such, some suggest that the Indo-Aryans used an onomatopoeic sound to imitate the harshness of alien tongue and to indicate incomprehension, thus coming up with \"mleccha\".\nEarly Indians spoke Sanskrit, which evolved into the various local modern Sanskrit-derived languages. Sanskrit was believed to include all the sounds necessary for communication. Early Indians would therefore dismiss other languages as foreign tongue, \"mleccha bhasha\". As the Sanskrit word itself suggests, \"mlecchas\" were those whose speech was alien. \"Correct speech\" was a crucial component of being able to take part in the appropriate \"&lt;a href=\"yajna\"&gt;yajna&lt;/a&gt;\"s (religious rituals and sacrifices). Thus, without correct speech, one could not hope to practice correct religion, either.\nThe notion of being Arya suggested a knowledge of Sanskrit in order to effectively perform ritual hymns; thus suggesting the importance of language. Parasher discusses the importance of knowing the \"correct speech\" in order to perform sacrifice and ritual in the religion of the \"&lt;a href=\"brahmanas\"&gt;brahmanas&lt;/a&gt;\". Parasher continued that: \"The best experts of the sacrificial art were undoubtedly the various families of the Brahmins who, placed in a hierarchy within the Indo-Aryan social system, became the upholders of pure and best speech\".\nHistorians note that early Indo-Aryans believed Sanskrit to be the superior language over all other forms of speech. As such, mleccha or barbarian speech was said to have meant any of the following: \"1) a language which was not necessarily alien, but the speech of the person or persons was improper because it was either hostile or vulgar; 2) a language, and here most probably Sanskrit, that was mispronounced and, thereby, incomprehensible: 3) finally, any foreign tongue which was naturally incomprehensible because it was unintelligible to those who did not understand a particular language\".\nTerritory.\nHistorians have stated that the notion of foreigners in ancient India \u2013 those living outside of the Indian subcontinent \u2013 was often accompanied by the idea that one was a barbarian. Still, it seemed that groups who did not come from outside of these areas, as well as foreigners, were designated by the term \"mleccha\", which carried with it a barbarian connotation.\nThus another distinction that was made between the mlecchas and non-mlecchas was area of habitation. Though they were considered a marginal group, the area characterize as the mleccha-desa (the natural border that separated their lands from that of the Aryans) was never permanent. Instead, it was defined by the changing ideas about the &lt;a href=\"%C4%80ry%C4%81varta\"&gt;\u0100ry\u0101varta&lt;/a&gt;. Parasher noted that \"the only consistent areas dubbed as \"mleccha desa\" were those regions inhabited by 'primitive tribes' who for long periods of time did not come under the sway of the brahmanical, Buddhist or Jaina influence\".\nThough the area of the Aryas expanded with time, the notion that was held over all of the land was that of \"purity.\" As Vedic literature refers only to the places and territories that were familiar to the Indo-Aryans, these lands eventually became part of the \u0100ry\u0101varta. Parasher thus indicates that the \u0100ry\u0101varta was designated as \"[t]he region where the river Sarasvati disappears is the Patiala district in the Punjab. The Pariyatra mountains belong to the Vindhya range, probably the hills of Malwa. The Kalakavana is identified with a tract somewhere near Prayaga.\" Still, other interpretations of the \u0100ry\u0101varta refer to those areas where the black antelope roams, for these areas are fit for the performance of sacrifice. Early Vedic literature focused on defining the area of habitation of the aryas for this land was considered pure; yet there is no actual reference to the mleccha country or behavior. Wherever the territory, though, the implications of naming such lands as the Aryavarta is that any lands excluded from that area were considered impure.\nFurther, there is evidence that Indians of the Vedic period actually had contact with people outside of the subcontinent, namely the Persians. The Persians, who ruled over the Indus river valley during this time (522\u2013486 BC) were not designated as mleccha, perhaps because they did not interfere with the brahmanical way of life.\nLater Vedic literature speaks of the western Anava tribes as mlecchas and occupying northern Punjab, &lt;a href=\"Sindh\"&gt;Sindh&lt;/a&gt; and eastern &lt;a href=\"Rajasthan\"&gt;Rajasthan&lt;/a&gt;. The tribes of the north were mlecchas either because they were located on the frontiers such as &lt;a href=\"Gandhara\"&gt;Gandhara&lt;/a&gt;, Kashmira and Kambojas and therefore both their speech and culture had become contaminated and differed from that of \u0100ry\u0101varta, or else, as in the case of southern India, they were once Aryas but having forsaken the Vedic rituals were regarded to mleccha status.\nCultural behavior.\nThe word \"mleccha\" emerged as a way for the ancient Hindus to classify those who did not subscribe to the \"traditional value system,\" though the characteristics of the so-called system were ambiguous. In sum, though, the idea was that the mlecchas were peoples who did not conform to what was culturally acceptable.\nEarly writings refer to these foreign peoples as \"half-civilized, unconverted people who rise or eat at improper times.\" They stated that monks and nuns should avoid certain areas of habitation because they were unsafe. Namely, that \"the ignorant populace might beat, harass, rob them under the impression that they were spies from hostile villages.\" Further, while some of these non-mlecchas, such as those of the Jaina faith, had established contact with people of the forest tribes, they were automatically designated as mlecchas. This was the typical attitude of people from the plains who took pride in their norms of settled agricultural and urban lifestyles.\nHistorians note that there were also systems in place to determine the validity \u2013 or \"purity\" \u2013 of certain customs, which would ultimately be judged by the Priest. As such there were intricate rules in place to define purity from impurity, laws of behavior, as well as rituals and customs, in an effort to educate the members of the Brahmanical system. Namely, these advisors took great pains to ensure that peoples of the Brahmanical system did not subscribe to any mleccha customs or rituals.\nThe Sanskrit-ization of names was a common feature among both indigenous and foreign mlecchas who slowly tried to move away from their status of mleccha. Very often, in the case of ruling families, it took one to two generations to make a transition. One of the most direct forms of the expression of the Brahmanical ritual purity was the form and type of food which a Brahmin could eat. He was forbidden to accept cooked food from any unclean person. Thus when the &lt;a href=\"Punjab%20region\"&gt;Punjab region&lt;/a&gt; became a mleccha area conquered by Muslims, the staple food was given a lower place in the food-ranking. By the twelfth century AD, wheat was described in one lexicon as 'food of the mlecchas', and &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt; became the 'pure' cereal. &lt;a href=\"Onions\"&gt;Onions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"garlic\"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt; was also regarded as the food of the mlecchas and therefore prohibited to the priestly intellectual class of Brahmins. Mlecchas drank &lt;a href=\"alcohol%20%28drug%29\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, ate cow flesh, which was strictly forbidden to a follower of Hindu orthopraxy, and believed in false gods.\n\"And the whole world will be filled with \"mleccha\" behavior and notions and ceremonies, and sacrifices will cease and joy will be nowhere and general rejoicing will disappear.[...] And, O Yudhishthira, the whole world will be \"mlecchified\". And men will cease to gratify the gods by offerings of Sraddhas. And no one will listen to the words of others and no one will be regarded as a preceptor by another. And, O ruler of men, intellectual darkness will envelop the whole earth.\"\nLiterature describing the Mleccha.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Mahabharata\"&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/a&gt;\", some Mleccha warriors are described as having \"heads completely shaved or half-shaved or covered with &lt;a href=\"Dreadlocks\"&gt;matted locks&lt;/a&gt;, [as being] impure in habits, and of crooked faces and noses They are \"dwellers of hills\" and \"denizens of mountain-caves. Mlecchas were born of the &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt; (belonging to &lt;a href=\"Vasishtha\"&gt;Vasishtha&lt;/a&gt;), of fierce eyes, accomplished in smiting looking like messengers of Death, and all conversant with the deceptive powers of the &lt;a href=\"Asura\"&gt;Asura&lt;/a&gt;s\".\nSwami Parmeshwaranand states the mleccha tribe was born from the tail of the celestial cow Nandini, kept by Vashishta for sacrificial purposes when there was a fight between &lt;a href=\"Vishvamitra\"&gt;Vishvamitra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vasistha\"&gt;Vasistha&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Mahabharata\" gives the following information regarding them:\nThe term is not attested in the &lt;a href=\"Vedas\"&gt;Vedas&lt;/a&gt;, but occurs for the first time in the late Vedic text the \"&lt;a href=\"Shatapatha%20Brahmana\"&gt;Shatapatha Brahmana&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Baudhayana%20sutras\"&gt;Baudhayana sutras&lt;/a&gt; define a mleccha as someone \"who eats beef or indulges in self-contradictory statements or is devoid of righteousness and purity of conduct\".\nMedieval Hindu literature, such as that of &lt;a href=\"Chaitanya%20Mahaprabhu\"&gt;Chaitanya Mahaprabhu&lt;/a&gt;, also uses the term to refer to those of larger groups of other religions, especially &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;s. In &lt;a href=\"medieval\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; India, a foreign visitor &lt;a href=\"al-Biruni\"&gt;al-Biruni&lt;/a&gt; (died 1048) noted that foreigners were regarded as 'unclean' or 'Mleccha' and Hindus were forbidden any social or matrimonial contact with them.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Gwalior\"&gt;Gwalior&lt;/a&gt; inscription of his descendant &lt;a href=\"Mihira%20Bhoja\"&gt;Mihira Bhoja&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gurjara-Pratihara%20dynasty\"&gt;Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty&lt;/a&gt; ruler &lt;a href=\"Nagabhata%20I\"&gt;Nagabhata I&lt;/a&gt; repulsed a mleccha invasion. These mlechchhas are identified with the &lt;a href=\"Caliphate%20campaigns%20in%20India\"&gt;Arab Muslim invaders&lt;/a&gt;."
