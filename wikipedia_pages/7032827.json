    "text": "The Atlantic languages of &lt;a href=\"Semitic%20languages\"&gt;Semitic&lt;/a&gt; or \"Semitidic\" (&lt;a href=\"paraphyletic\"&gt;para&lt;/a&gt;-Semitic) origin are a disputed concept in &lt;a href=\"historical%20linguistics\"&gt;historical linguistics&lt;/a&gt; put forward by &lt;a href=\"Theo%20Vennemann\"&gt;Theo Vennemann&lt;/a&gt;. He proposed that Semitic-language-speakers occupied regions in Europe thousands of years ago and influenced the later European languages that are not part of the Semitic family. The theory has found no notable acceptance among linguists or other relevant scholars and is criticised as being based on sparse and often-misinterpreted data.\nTheory and lines of argumentation.\nAccording to Vennemann, Afroasiatic seafarers settled the European Atlantic coast and are to be associated with the &lt;a href=\"European%20Megalithic%20Culture\"&gt;European Megalithic Culture&lt;/a&gt;. They left a &lt;a href=\"superstratum\"&gt;superstratum&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20languages\"&gt;Germanic languages&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"substratum\"&gt;substratum&lt;/a&gt; in the development of &lt;a href=\"Insular%20Celtic\"&gt;Insular Celtic&lt;/a&gt;. He claimed that speakers of \"Atlantic\" (Semitic or Semitidic) founded coastal colonies from the 5th millennium BC. Thus, \"Atlantic\" influenced the lexicon and the structure of Germanic and the structure of Insular Celtic. According to Vennemann, migrating Indo-European-speakers encountered non-Indo-European-speakers in Northern Europe, who had already named rivers, mountains and settlements in a language that he called \"&lt;a href=\"Vasconic%20substratum%20theory\"&gt;Vasconic&lt;/a&gt;\". He considered some toponyms on the Atlantic coast to be neither Vasconic nor Indo-European. He considered them to have derived from languages that were related to the Mediterranean &lt;a href=\"Afroasiatic%20languages\"&gt;Hamito-Semitic group&lt;/a&gt;.\nVennemann based his theory on the claim that Germanic &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20substrate%20hypothesis\"&gt;words without cognates&lt;/a&gt; in other &lt;a href=\"Indo-European%20languages\"&gt;Indo-European languages&lt;/a&gt; very often belong to semantic fields that are typical for &lt;a href=\"loanwords\"&gt;loanwords&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"superstratum\"&gt;superstratum&lt;/a&gt; language, such as warfare, law and communal life. Likewise, he proposed Semitic etymologies for words of unknown or disputed origin; for instance, he related the word \"bee\" to &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20language\"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; \"bj-t\" or the name \"&lt;a href=\"%C3%89ire\"&gt;\u00c9ire&lt;/a&gt;\", older \"*\u012bwerij\u016b\" to \"*\u02bcj-wr\u02bc(m)\", 'island (of) copper', as in &lt;a href=\"Akkadian%20language\"&gt;Akkadian&lt;/a&gt; \"weri\u02bcum\" 'copper'.\nOther evidence for a Semitic superstratum included a Semitic influence on the Germanic form of the &lt;a href=\"Indo-European%20ablaut\"&gt;Indo-European ablaut&lt;/a&gt; system and similarities between &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20paganism\"&gt;Germanic paganism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamian%20mythology\"&gt;Mesopotamian mythology&lt;/a&gt;, such as the parallelism between &lt;a href=\"Freyja\"&gt;Freyja&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ishtar\"&gt;Ishtar&lt;/a&gt;, goddesses of war and love.\nThe idea of a connection between Insular Celtic and Afroasiatic goes back to &lt;a href=\"John%20Davies%20%28Mallwyd%29\"&gt;John Davies&lt;/a&gt; (1632) but was expanded by &lt;a href=\"John%20Morris-Jones\"&gt;John Morris-Jones&lt;/a&gt; in 1913 and was developed further by Vennemann. The position is supported by &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Pokorny\"&gt;Julius Pokorny&lt;/a&gt; (1927\u20131949), and Vennemann identified &lt;a href=\"Phoenicians\"&gt;Phoenicians&lt;/a&gt; as the likely people. A key factor was the dominant word order in Insular Celtic, compared to other Indo-European languages, together with lexical correspondences. Another important factor was the identification of the people later known as &lt;a href=\"Picts\"&gt;Picts&lt;/a&gt;. Vennemann held the position that they spoke an Atlantic language. That belief was also held by &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Zimmer%20%28Celticist%29\"&gt;Heinrich Zimmer&lt;/a&gt; (1898) but is not generally accepted.\nCriticism.\nHayim Y. Sheynin, adjunct professor of Jewish Literature at &lt;a href=\"Gratz%20College\"&gt;Gratz College&lt;/a&gt;, critically reviewed the work \"Europa Vasconica \u2013 Europa Semitica\" (2003) in which Vennemann laid out his arguments for the existence of a Semitic (or \"Semitidic\") superstratum in the Germanic languages. Sheynin concluded that Vennemann's arguments were unacceptable on several grounds. He noted that Vennemann based important parts of his main claim on long-outdated and critically rejected literature, that many of the words presented by Vennemann as evidence of an Atlantic (Semitidic) superstratum were nothing more than \"mere ad hoc sound similarities\" and that Vennemann's claims made in reference to Semitic range from \"objectionable\" to \"ridiculous\". In summary, Sheynin concludes \"that [Vennemann] failed in this book not only as comparative linguist, or etymologist, but even in his narrow specialization as a Germanist... In short, we consider the book a complete failure\".\nThe book was also reviewed by &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Baldi\"&gt;Baldi&lt;/a&gt; and Page (\"Lingua\" 116, 2006). They also were critical of his Germanic part of the theory. Since there are no Phoenician inscriptions in Britain, if traders visited the island, the Insular Celtic part of the theory depended on linguistic evidence. The 5th millennium is very early for Celtic-speakers in Britain, compared with other theories, and Mallory suggested a date of around 1000 BC. Vennemann's view of the establishment of megaliths is not supported by mainstream archaeologists, who view their construction as having a widespread local origin along Oceanic Europe or one that spread from Portugal long before the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Beaker\"&gt;Bell Beaker&lt;/a&gt; or any possible &lt;a href=\"Cardium%20pottery\"&gt;Cardium culture&lt;/a&gt; influences from the Mediterranean. Eska (1994) argues that the change from verb-noninitial word order in Continental Celtic to verb-initial in Insular Celtic is internally motivated. Baldi and Page stated that the strength of Vennemann's proposals lies in his lexical arguments, which merited serious consideration. The origin of the Picts is unknown: see discussions by Jackson and by Wainright as well as those by Kitson and by Forsyth. Since about 2000, it has been generally held that &lt;a href=\"Pictish%20language\"&gt;Pictish&lt;/a&gt; is Celtic, and clear evidence of Pre-Indo-European elements is absent."
