    "text": "Hyde and Go Tweet is a 1960 &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Merrie%20Melodies\"&gt;Merrie Melodies&lt;/a&gt;\" animated short directed by &lt;a href=\"Friz%20Freleng\"&gt;Friz Freleng&lt;/a&gt;. The voices were performed by &lt;a href=\"Mel%20Blanc\"&gt;Mel Blanc&lt;/a&gt;. The short was released on May 14, 1960, and stars &lt;a href=\"Tweety\"&gt;Tweety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvester%20the%20Cat\"&gt;Sylvester&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe short is the third directed by &lt;a href=\"Friz%20Freleng\"&gt;Freleng&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson\"&gt;Robert Louis Stevenson&lt;/a&gt;'s 1886 novella \"&lt;a href=\"Strange%20Case%20of%20Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde\"&gt;Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&lt;/a&gt;\". The title is a play on the game &lt;a href=\"Hide%20and%20seek\"&gt;hide and go seek&lt;/a&gt;. It was featured in the film \"&lt;a href=\"Daffy%20Duck%27s%20Quackbusters\"&gt;Daffy Duck's Quackbusters&lt;/a&gt;\", with new animation showing Sylvester in Daffy's office.\nPlot.\nSylvester is sleeping on the ledge of a tall &lt;a href=\"building\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;. He is just outside the window of the laboratory and office of mild-mannered &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%28character%29\"&gt;Dr. Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, who is shown entering the laboratory, drinking a Hyde Formula and briefly turning into a monstrous, evilly laughing alter-ego. Sylvester hears the laughter and awakens, startled, but when he looks inside the window, he sees only the re-transformed Jekyll departing the laboratory. Sylvester laughs it off and goes back to sleep.\nSuddenly waking up, Sylvester tries to catch some &lt;a href=\"Columbidae\"&gt;pigeons&lt;/a&gt;, but to no avail. He then pursues his prey, Tweety, along the building's ledge. Tweety escapes into the laboratory and jumps into the Hyde Formula bottle. Sylvester demands that Tweety show himself, which he does, thanks to the Hyde formula, now as a crazy, evilly laughing giant bird-monster that begins chasing Sylvester.\nFor most of the rest of the cartoon, Tweety frequently switches between his usual, innocent self (which Sylvester chases) and the evil bird-monster (from which Sylvester runs away). After several back-and-forth chases (which includes Sylvester being tricked by the normal Tweety into running into an out of order chute for an elevator, as well as jumping out a window to escape the evil bird-monster form), Sylvester nabs a normal-sized Tweety. The cat locks himself in a small kitchen, throws the key out the window to make sure that Tweety \"don't get out and that 'goon' don't get in,\" and begins to make Tweety into a sandwich. But while Sylvester is searching for some ketchup, Tweety changes back into his menacing, Hyde-like self and devours his adversary whole in a single gulp (\"What? No ketchup? Well, I guess I'll just have to eat you without KETCH...!\"). Sylvester frees himself and tries to escape from the room.\nJust then, Sylvester awakens...to realize that this whole experience was only a nightmare and to see a normal-sized Tweety struggling to fly to the ledge of the building. Fearing the events of his nightmare are about to come true, Sylvester cries out and runs through a &lt;a href=\"brick\"&gt;brick&lt;/a&gt; wall to escape (\"Help! Save me! Ah, ah, ah! Save me! He's a killer! HELP!!!\"). Two cats (variants of two of the cats in \"&lt;a href=\"Birds%20Anonymous\"&gt;Birds Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;\") observe his action and each remark \"Most outrageous exhibition of wanton cowardice.\" and \"Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk...Shameful.\" Tweety agrees on that, closing the cartoon by telling the audience, \"Yeah, shameful!\""
