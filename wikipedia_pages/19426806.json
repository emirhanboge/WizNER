During this time, he became the principal &lt;a href=\"Military%20Secretary%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;military secretary&lt;/a&gt; to President Ayub Khan. In a short time, Rear-Admiral Ahsan gained influence on President Ayub Khan and advised him on important military issues concerning on the defence of the nation at the cabinet meeting chaired by the President Ayub.\nWhile in East, he played a crucial role in deployment of armed forces and prevented the army to involve in politics while opposing any military action against East Pakistani activists after the &lt;a href=\"1964%20East%20Pakistan%20riots\"&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt; in 1964 despite the calls.\n1965 war with India and Commander in chief.\nIn 1965, he was stationed back to Pakistan and assumed the command of Naval Intelligence as its &lt;a href=\"Director-General\"&gt;Director-General&lt;/a&gt;, and participated in &lt;a href=\"Indo-Pakistani%20war%20of%201965\"&gt;second war with India&lt;/a&gt; in 1965. Rear-Admiral Ahsan and his staff at the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Headquarters%20%28Pakistan%20Navy%29\"&gt;Navy NHQ&lt;/a&gt; helped planned out the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Somnath\"&gt;naval offense&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dwarka\"&gt;Dwarka&lt;/a&gt; and partially leading the fleet as its Commander. The operation met with mixed results but it stopped the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Indian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; raiding Karachi and Pakistan's coastal areas as Admiral Ahsan collated the intelligence reports on the Indian Navy's strategic western naval positions, and orchestrated naval operations against the Indian Navy.\nAfter the war, he was most senior admiral serving in the navy and was nominated for navy's &lt;a href=\"chief%20of%20staff\"&gt;chief of staff&lt;/a&gt; by outgoing &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Naval%20Staff%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;naval chief&lt;/a&gt; Admiral &lt;a href=\"Afzal%20Rahman%20Khan\"&gt;A.R. Khan&lt;/a&gt; in 1966. His nomination papers were approved by President Ayub Khan in 1966, and appointed him as &lt;a href=\"Commander%20in%20Chief%20%28Pakistan%20Navy%29\"&gt;commander in chief&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Navy\"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1967, he was promoted to the three-star rank, &lt;a href=\"Vice-Admiral\"&gt;Vice-Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, and was honored with &lt;a href=\"Sitara-e-Pakistan\"&gt;Sitara-e-Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; by President Ayub.\nAs a naval chief, he oversaw the induction of the &lt;a href=\"PNS%20Hangor\"&gt;Daphn\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; submarines procured from France in 1966 in navy's submarine branch. In 1966, he held successful negotiation with &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Navy\"&gt;Turkish Navy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Refitting\"&gt;refitted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mid-life%20update\"&gt;upgraded&lt;/a&gt; the submarine &lt;a href=\"PNS%20Ghazi\"&gt;PNS \"Ghazi\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 1966\u201368, Admiral Ahsan knew of Indian Navy massive &lt;a href=\"Future%20of%20the%20Indian%20Navy\"&gt;procurement and acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20systems%20of%20the%20Indian%20Navy\"&gt;weapon systems&lt;/a&gt; being acquired from the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and United Kingdom. On multiple meetings with President Ayub, he raised the issue of modernizing the navy against India, and kept warning the &lt;a href=\"GHQ%20%28Pakistan%20Army%29\"&gt;Army GHQ&lt;/a&gt; of potential and possible Indian Navy's attack on &lt;a href=\"West%20Pakistan\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Pakistan\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt; region of the country; his reservations were bypassed on every meeting and warnings were not heed due to the financial reasons. His Navy NHQ staff was in brief conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Headquarters%20%28Pakistan%20Air%20Force%29\"&gt;Air AHQ&lt;/a&gt; staff over the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Naval%20Air%20Arm\"&gt;naval aviation&lt;/a&gt; by induction of fighter jets in 1968. The &lt;a href=\"Air%20Headquarters%20%28Pakistan%20Air%20Force%29\"&gt;Air AHQ&lt;/a&gt; staff bypassed his recommendation over the loss of jets and their pilots in seas in an event of conflict with India. He succeeded in convincing President Ayub in acquiring the missile boats only, and permissions were granted to procured the Soviet-built &lt;a href=\"Osa-class%20missile%20boat\"&gt;Osa-class missile boat&lt;/a&gt; in 1968.\nHe led series of unsuccessful talks with the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Navy\"&gt;Soviet Navy&lt;/a&gt; and Russian Marshal &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Grechko\"&gt;Andrei Grechko&lt;/a&gt; in 1969 due to their &lt;a href=\"Indo-Soviet%20Treaty%20of%20Friendship%20and%20Cooperation\"&gt;warming&lt;/a&gt; of relations with India. From 1966 to 1969, his &lt;a href=\"NHQ%20%28Pakistan%20Navy%29\"&gt;Navy NHQ&lt;/a&gt; staff tussle with the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Finance%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;Finance ministry&lt;/a&gt; over the issues of budget and financial support for modernization of navy without any success.\nHe established the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Services%20Group%20Navy\"&gt;Special Services Group Navy&lt;/a&gt; (SSG[N]) and commissioned the &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Marines\"&gt;Pakistan Marines&lt;/a&gt; in 1966 after commissioning the naval &lt;a href=\"PNS%20Qasim\"&gt;facilities&lt;/a&gt; for training purposes in the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Operations%20Forces\"&gt;special operations&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1966, he further accepted the recommendation from &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; to train its special forces unit, an equivalent organization to that of &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Navy%20SEALs\"&gt;U.S. Navy SEALs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Karachi, he went on to commission the &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Naval%20Academy\"&gt;Naval Academy&lt;/a&gt; to provide teaching of the naval staff and cadets instead of sending cadets to United Kingdom for training and education. From 1966 to 1968, he served on the served on the &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20Governors\"&gt;Board of Governors&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cadet%20College%20Petaro\"&gt;Cadet College Petaro&lt;/a&gt;.\nVice-Admiral Ahsan is also credited with founding &lt;a href=\"Port%20Qasim\"&gt;Port Qasim&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 Pakistan's second port\u00a0\u2013 after exploring the coast around &lt;a href=\"Phitti\"&gt;Phitti Creek&lt;/a&gt;, when he was Chief of Naval Staff. He immediately met with then\u2013Foreign Minister &lt;a href=\"Zulfikar%20Ali%20Bhutto\"&gt;Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&lt;/a&gt; where he convinced Bhutto in 1972 to locate the port there.\nAfter convincing Bhutto, he supervised the construction and establishment of the port where he set up the main industries and machineries at the Port. The main channel of this port bears his name. From 1966 to 1969, he established the &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Navy\"&gt;East-Pakistan Navy&lt;/a&gt; and commissioned the &lt;a href=\"warship\"&gt;warship&lt;/a&gt;s, \"PNS &lt;a href=\"Sylhet\"&gt;Sylhet&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"PNS%20Tughril%20%28D167%29\"&gt;\"PNS Tughril\"&lt;/a&gt;, in its arm. However, he struggled with expanding the East-Pakistan Navy's capabilities as many sailors and officers had defected to India to joined the &lt;a href=\"Awami%20League\"&gt;Awami League&lt;/a&gt;'s military wing\u2013 the \"&lt;a href=\"Mukti%20Bahini\"&gt;Mukti Bahini&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPolitics.\nYahya administration and governorship.\nAfter President &lt;a href=\"Ayub%20Khan%20%28general%29\"&gt;Ayub Khan&lt;/a&gt; tendered resignation due to worsening of &lt;a href=\"Law%20and%20order%20in%20Pakistan\"&gt;law and order&lt;/a&gt; situation in the country, and invited &lt;a href=\"Commander-in-Chief%20of%20the%20Pakistan%20Army\"&gt;Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army&lt;/a&gt; General &lt;a href=\"Yahya%20Khan\"&gt;Yahya Khan&lt;/a&gt; to take over the &lt;a href=\"Pakistani%20presidency\"&gt;presidency&lt;/a&gt;. In 1969, he relieved the &lt;a href=\"Commander%20in%20Chief%20%28Pakistan%20Navy%29\"&gt;naval command&lt;/a&gt; to Admiral &lt;a href=\"Muzaffar%20Hassan\"&gt;Muzaffar Hassan&lt;/a&gt; to be appointed as deputy &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Martial%20Law%20Administrator\"&gt;CMLA&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Yahya%20Khan\"&gt;Yahya administration&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 1969, he joined the Yahya administration as &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;cabinet minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Finance%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Statistics%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Commerce%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;commerce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Industry%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;industry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Planning%20Commission%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;planning commission&lt;/a&gt;. However, this was short-lived and Admiral Ahsan was appointed as Governor of East Pakistan on 1 September 1969.\nThe assignment was considered very difficult by the &lt;a href=\"Pakistani%20military\"&gt;Pakistani military&lt;/a&gt; when many senior officials in West were reluctant to accept appointments in East Pakistan. The &lt;a href=\"Law%20and%20order%20%28politics%29\"&gt;law and order&lt;/a&gt; situation was quickly deteriorating under the &lt;a href=\"Military%20coups%20in%20Bangladesh\"&gt;martial law&lt;/a&gt; enforced by &lt;a href=\"Major-General\"&gt;Major-General&lt;/a&gt; Muzaffaruddin in &lt;a href=\"East%20Pakistan\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Cabinet meeting, &lt;a href=\"Yahya%20Khan\"&gt;President Yahya&lt;/a&gt; was told that the situation in East is at a critical, and his government needed an administrator with a good reputation in the province. In an attempt to control the &lt;a href=\"Law%20and%20order%20in%20Pakistan\"&gt;law and order&lt;/a&gt; in the country, Admiral Ahsan's service was extended and appointed governor in East and arrived his &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dacca&lt;/a&gt; to take an oath from &lt;a href=\"Dhaka%20High%20Court\"&gt;Dhaka High Court&lt;/a&gt; Justice Salahuddin at the &lt;a href=\"Dhaka%20University\"&gt;Dhaka University&lt;/a&gt; in 1969. In talks with representatives of Pakistani print and electronic news media, Admiral Ahsan reportedly quoted that he was \"pretty sure\" that by 1971, new government of elected representatives would replace the interim government.\"\nHe became governor of East Pakistan in 1969. Soon after, he was reportedly in conflict with Governor of West Pakistan, Air Marshal &lt;a href=\"Nur%20Khan\"&gt;Nur Khan&lt;/a&gt;, over the issues of &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Framework%20Order%2C%201970\"&gt;legal and political&lt;/a&gt; reforms in the country while President Yahya was in conflict with his army chief Lieutenant-General &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Hamid%20Khan%20%28general%29\"&gt;Abdul Hamid Khan&lt;/a&gt; on administrative issues in 1969\u201370.\nMany initiatives were taken by Admiral Ahsan to resolve the political crises of East by keeping in good terms with President Yahya and noted that the &lt;a href=\"Six%20point%20movement\"&gt;six-point&lt;/a&gt; were not new. In 1969, he paid a &lt;a href=\"state%20visit\"&gt;state visit&lt;/a&gt; to the United States to meet with &lt;a href=\"Elliot%20Richardson\"&gt;Elliot Richardson&lt;/a&gt; to gain foreign support for East Pakistan and sustainability in the region. In addition, he also arranged the visit of U.S. Navy officials to visit him at the &lt;a href=\"Bangabhaban\"&gt;Governor's House, Dhaka&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%E2%80%93United%20States%20military%20relations\"&gt;strengthened military relations&lt;/a&gt; with the United States.\nIn 1970, his government coordinated efforts to rehabilitate the infrastructure after the &lt;a href=\"1970%20Bhola%20cyclone\"&gt;deadly cyclone&lt;/a&gt; and used the military coordinate to relief operations after meeting with President Yahya who had instruct him to \"take charge\".\n1970 general elections, resignation and 1971 war.\nIn 1970, he oversaw the electoral process to hold the nationwide &lt;a href=\"1970%20Pakistani%20general%20election\"&gt;parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt; held in the country in a charged atmosphere. Under his rule, the law and order had been improved and it was projected that Awami League led by &lt;a href=\"Sheikh%20Mujibur%20Rahman\"&gt;Sheikh Mujibur Rahman&lt;/a&gt; would claim the &lt;a href=\"supermajority\"&gt;supermajority&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20parliament\"&gt;provincial assembly&lt;/a&gt; that would allow them to form the national government in &lt;a href=\"Islamabad\"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;. The Awami League secured ~39.2% of the seats in the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Peoples%20Party\"&gt;Pakistan Peoples Party&lt;/a&gt; (PPP) led by &lt;a href=\"Zulfikar%20Ali%20Bhutto\"&gt;Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&lt;/a&gt; who ended up with 18.6% of the seats\u00a0\u2013 all from West Pakistan. Zulfikar Bhutto refused to negotiate the &lt;a href=\"Six%20point%20movement\"&gt;six points&lt;/a&gt; when President Yahya met with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and put more stress on the situation after telling his party workers not to visit Dhaka. About the postpone of the power ceremony, &lt;a href=\"Kamal%20Hossain\"&gt;Kamal Hossain&lt;/a&gt; reportedly notified Admiral Ahsan of \"danger\" of delaying the power transition.\nTogether with his principal staff officer Lieutenant-General &lt;a href=\"Sahabzada%20Yaqub%20Khan\"&gt;Sahabzada Yaqub Khan&lt;/a&gt;, he provided his arguments on numerous occasions to President Yahya against the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Searchlight\"&gt;military actions&lt;/a&gt; in East and their arguments were well known to the United States's politicians.\nOn 22 February 1971, Ahsan attended a high-level meeting chaired by President Yahya Khan, a gathering which Ahsan described as \"tense\", where the atmosphere was highly \"anti-Bengali\", with no Bengali representation in the policy and decision-making. He opposed a military solution to the supposed crisis in East Pakistan.\nAdmiral Ahsan renewed his offer to President Yahya, Rahman, and Bhutto to work out an arrangement where the Pakistani military deployments to support the &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Eastern%20Command\"&gt;Eastern Command&lt;/a&gt; could get out intact, without &lt;a href=\"Instrument%20of%20Surrender%20%281971%29\"&gt;being humiliated&lt;/a&gt;. Known as the Ahsan Formula, Pakistan would become a confederation of the two wings, giving East Pakistan a degree of autonomy. Yahya would head the confederation. East Pakistanis in West Pakistan would be moved to East Pakistan and vice versa. National assets would be divided in proportion to population. The military vetoed the plan.\nIn February 1971, he supervised the military deployments in East that were already preparing to conduct a military operation to curb the movement.\nDisheartened and isolated by his colleagues, Admiral Ahsan tried reaching President Yahya by telephone without success. On 7 March 1971, Admiral Ahsan resigned in protest from his position as Martial Law Administrator of East Pakistan.\nHe participated in the &lt;a href=\"Indo-Pakistani%20war%20of%201971\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; in 1971 but without an assignment of any command at the &lt;a href=\"NHQ%20%28Pakistan%20Navy%29\"&gt;Navy NHQ&lt;/a&gt; and sought &lt;a href=\"honorable%20discharge\"&gt;honorable discharge&lt;/a&gt; from the navy after the &lt;a href=\"Instrument%20of%20Surrender%20%281971%29\"&gt;war ended&lt;/a&gt; in the winter of 1971.\nIn an article titled \"A nation's shame\" published in the \"Newsline magazine\" of September 2000, Ahsan concluded:\nBut who was responsible for creating this hostile atmosphere and hatred among the people? The situation deteriorated further after General Yahya Khan postponed the first session of the newly elected constituent assembly. It became very clear immediately after the election results that the generals were not prepared to transfer power to the Awami League. First the delay in summoning the National Assembly session and later its postponement confirmed the Bengalis' worst fears, that the election results were not acceptable both to the generals and to the majority of West Pakistani politicians. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto publicly called for a boycott of the assembly session. Such a transgression was bound to further fuel public resentment.\nWar Enquiry Commission.\nHe welcomed the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Hamoodur%20Rahman%20Commission\"&gt;War Enquiry Commission&lt;/a&gt; that was to be chaired by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Justice%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;Chief Justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hamoodur%20Rahman\"&gt;Hamoodur Rahman&lt;/a&gt; in 1972, and attended its proceedings. He testified before the commission and described the hostile mood of the military leadership when they decided to postpone the assembly session and launch a military operation in the eastern province. Ahsan stated:\nOn arrival in Rawalpindi, I was alarmed to notice the high tide of &lt;a href=\"militarism\"&gt;militarism&lt;/a&gt; flowing turbulently... There was open talk of a military solution according to plan. I was caught quite unaware in this atmosphere for I know of no military solution which could possibly solve whatever crisis was supposed to be impending in the minds of the authorities. It was evident from the statement that the decision to launch a military operation was taken without consulting the Governor of East Pakistan who was the only sane voice in the government.\nThe President presided over the meeting of the governors and martial law administrators attended as usual by the military and the civilian officers of the &lt;a href=\"Pakistani%20Intelligence%20Community\"&gt;intelligence community&lt;/a&gt;. It is relevant to record that among the tribe of governors and MLAs, I was the only non-army governor and the only active naval officer in the midst of active service men. I was the only person, though a non-Bengali, who had to represent the sentiments of seventy million Bengalis to a &lt;a href=\"Pakistani%20government\"&gt;Pakistani government&lt;/a&gt;. During the past 17 months, in meetings and conferences, my brief ran counter to the cut-and-dried solutions of Pakistan representatives and civil servants. The president invariably gave decisions which accommodated East Pakistan's viewpoint, at least partially. This made me unpopular with my colleagues who probably thought I was \"difficult at best\" and \"sold\" to the Bengalis at worst.\nLegacy.\npost-retirement, death and honours.\nAhsan retired from the Navy.\nHe was appointed chairman of Port Qasim Authority in 1972 and later chairman of &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20National%20Shipping%20Corporation\"&gt;National Shipping Corporation&lt;/a&gt; from 1975 to 1976. After leaving the public service in 1976, he spent his remaining years in quietness and put himself out of public eye during his last years. During his last years, Admiral Ahsan learned French and played bridge.\nAhsan died peacefully in 1989 in his Karachi villa and was given an honorary &lt;a href=\"guard%20of%20honor\"&gt;guard of honor&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;Government of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and buried in military graveyard in Karachi per accordance to his will. His death was mourned by Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Benazir%20Bhutto\"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt;, President &lt;a href=\"Ghulam%20Ishaq%20Khan\"&gt;Ghulam Ishaq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chairman%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;Chairman joint chiefs&lt;/a&gt; Admiral &lt;a href=\"Iftikhar%20Ahmed%20Sirohey\"&gt;Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey&lt;/a&gt;, and Chiefs of Staff of &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Army%20Staff%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Naval%20Staff%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Air%20Staff%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1990, the Pakistan Navy established a &lt;a href=\"naval%20base\"&gt;naval base&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Balochistan%2C%20Pakistan\"&gt;Balochistan&lt;/a&gt; and commissioned in 1991 as &lt;a href=\"PNS%20Ahsan\"&gt;PNS Ahsan&lt;/a&gt; to honor his services.\nThe main channel of the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Qasim\"&gt;Port Qasim&lt;/a&gt; bears his name, as it known as Ahsan Channel, which was inaugurated by Prime minister &lt;a href=\"Benazir%20Bhutto\"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt; who acknowledged Admiral Ahsan's as the founder of Port Qasim at a speech on the occasion of the opening of a new terminal at Port Qasim on 4 August 1989."
