    "text": "Cala Xuclar (pronounced in &lt;a href=\"eivissenc\"&gt;eivissenc&lt;/a&gt; \"choocla\") is a beach in the northern part of the &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href=\"Ibiza\"&gt;Ibiza&lt;/a&gt;. It is in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Sant%20Joan%20de%20Labritja%20%28municipality%29\"&gt;Sant Joan de Labritja&lt;/a&gt; and is north of the village of &lt;a href=\"Sant%20Joan%20de%20Labritja\"&gt;Sant Joan de Labritja&lt;/a&gt;, and west of the beach resort of &lt;a href=\"Portinatx\"&gt;Portinatx&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe beach of \"Cala Xuclar\" is set in a very small cove surrounded by cliffs and is at the head of a \"seasonal\" river. This is one of the best \"get-away-from-it-all beaches\" on the island. The small bay is excellent for &lt;a href=\"snorkelling\"&gt;snorkelling&lt;/a&gt; and you enjoy the richness of underwater &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; living in its crystal waters of this cove. On both side of the cove there are several rustic fishermens' huts and at the water line there are some &lt;a href=\"sea%20caves\"&gt;sea caves&lt;/a&gt;. From the cove there are walks along the cliffs paths through the pine woods that clad the cliff tops here. During July and August there is a small snack bar (chiringuito) which serves visitors a selection of locally-caught fish and &lt;a href=\"tapas\"&gt;tapas&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Alioli\"&gt;Alioli&lt;/a&gt; potatoes.\nGetting There.\nLeave Portinatx on the C 733 road and after watch out for the small signpost on the left just after the S' Illot d'es Rencli bay. From here there is a very steep rutted dirt track down to the cove. There is very limited parking space available, which will get very full at the height of the season."
