    "text": "A d\u00e9tournement (), meaning \"rerouting, hijacking\" in &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, is a technique developed in the 1950s by the &lt;a href=\"Letterist%20International\"&gt;Letterist International&lt;/a&gt;, and later adapted by the &lt;a href=\"Situationist%20International\"&gt;Situationist International&lt;/a&gt; (SI), that was defined in the SI's inaugural 1958 journal as \"[t]he integration of present or past artistic productions into a superior construction of a milieu. In this sense there can be no situationist painting or music, but only a situationist use of those means. In a more elementary sense, \"d\u00e9tournement\" within the old cultural spheres is a method of propaganda, a method which reveals the wearing out and loss of importance of those spheres.\" \nIt has been defined elsewhere as \"turning expressions of the capitalist system and its &lt;a href=\"media%20culture\"&gt;media culture&lt;/a&gt; against itself\"\u2014as when slogans and logos are turned against their advertisers or the political status quo. \nD\u00e9tournement was prominently used to set up subversive political pranks, an influential tactic called &lt;a href=\"situationist%20prank\"&gt;situationist prank&lt;/a&gt; that was reprised by the &lt;a href=\"punk%20movement\"&gt;punk movement&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1970s and inspired the &lt;a href=\"culture%20jamming\"&gt;culture jamming&lt;/a&gt; movement in the late 1980s.\nIts opposite is &lt;a href=\"recuperation%20%28politics%29\"&gt;recuperation&lt;/a&gt;, in which radical ideas or the social image of people who are viewed negatively are twisted, commodified, and absorbed in a more socially acceptable context.\nDefinition.\nIn general it can be defined as a variation on previous work, in which the newly created work has a meaning that is antagonistic or antithetical to the original. The original media work that is \"d\u00e9tourned\" must be somewhat familiar to the target audience, so that it can appreciate the opposition of the new message. The artist or commentator making the variation can reuse only some of the characteristic elements of the originating work.\nD\u00e9tournement is similar to &lt;a href=\"satire\"&gt;satirical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"parody\"&gt;parody&lt;/a&gt;, but employs more direct reuse or faithful &lt;a href=\"mimicry\"&gt;mimicry&lt;/a&gt; of the original works rather than constructing a new work which merely alludes strongly to the original. It may be contrasted with &lt;a href=\"recuperation%20%28sociology%29\"&gt;recuperation&lt;/a&gt;, in which originally subversive works and ideas are themselves appropriated by mainstream media.\nOne could view d\u00e9tournement as forming the opposite side of the coin to \"&lt;a href=\"recuperation%20%28politics%29\"&gt;recuperation&lt;/a&gt;\" (where radical ideas and images become safe and commodified), in that images produced by the spectacle get altered and subverted so that rather than supporting the \"status quo\", their meaning becomes changed in order to put across a more radical or oppositional message.\n&lt;a href=\"Guy%20Debord\"&gt;Guy Debord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gil%20J.%20Wolman\"&gt;Gil J. Wolman&lt;/a&gt; categorized d\u00e9tourned elements into two types: \"minor d\u00e9tournements\" and \"deceptive d\u00e9tournements\". Minor d\u00e9tournements are d\u00e9tournements of elements that in themselves are of no real importance such as a snapshot, a press clipping, an everyday object which draw all their meaning from being placed in a new context. Deceptive d\u00e9tournements are when already significant elements such as a major political or philosophical text, great artwork or work of literature take on new meanings or scope by being placed in a new context.\nD\u00e9tournement is the integration of past or present artistic production into a superior construction of a milieu. In this sense there can be no situationist painting or music, but only a situationist use of these means. In a more primitive sense, d\u00e9tournement with the old cultural spheres is a method of propaganda, a method that testifies to the wearing out and loss of importance of those spheres.\nExamples after the Situationist International.\nIn the United States, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Discussion\"&gt;Frank Discussion&lt;/a&gt; is widely known for his use of d\u00e9tournement in his works dating from the late 1970s through the present, particularly with the &lt;a href=\"Feederz\"&gt;Feederz&lt;/a&gt;. The use of d\u00e9tournement by &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Kruger\"&gt;Barbara Kruger&lt;/a&gt; familiarised many with the technique, and it was extensively and effectively used as part of the early &lt;a href=\"AIDS%20Coalition%20to%20Unleash%20Power\"&gt;HIV/AIDS activism&lt;/a&gt; of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Examples of contemporary detournement include &lt;a href=\"Adbusters\"&gt;Adbusters&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"subvertising\"&gt;subvertisements&lt;/a&gt;\" and other instances of &lt;a href=\"culture%20jamming\"&gt;culture jamming&lt;/a&gt;, as well as poems composed collaboratively by &lt;a href=\"Marlene%20Mountain\"&gt;Marlene Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Conneally\"&gt;Paul Conneally&lt;/a&gt;, and others, in which quotations from such famous sources as the &lt;a href=\"Ten%20Commandments\"&gt;Ten Commandments&lt;/a&gt; and quotations by &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; are combined with haiku-like phrases to produce a larger work intended to subvert the original source. The comic artist &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Neely\"&gt;Brad Neely&lt;/a&gt;'s reinterpretation of &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Potter\"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Wizard%20People%2C%20Dear%20Reader\"&gt;Wizard People&lt;/a&gt;,\" took &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt;' first Harry Potter film, \"&lt;a href=\"Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Philosopher%27s%20Stone%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Sorcerer's Stone&lt;/a&gt;,\" and substituted the original soundtrack with a narration that casts the hero as a &lt;a href=\"Nietzschean\"&gt;Nietzschean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cbermensch\"&gt;superman&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe concept of d\u00e9tournement has had a popular influence amongst contemporary radicals, and the technique can be seen in action in the present day when looking at the work of &lt;a href=\"Culture%20Jammer\"&gt;Culture Jammer&lt;/a&gt;s including the &lt;a href=\"Cacophony%20Society\"&gt;Cacophony Society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Billboard Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"monochrom\"&gt;monochrom&lt;/a&gt;, Occupy Movements and &lt;a href=\"Adbusters\"&gt;Adbusters&lt;/a&gt;, whose \"subvertisements\" \"detourn\" &lt;a href=\"Nike%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt; adverts, for example. In this case, the original advertisement's imagery is altered in order to draw attention to said company's policy of shifting their production base to cheap-labour third-world \"&lt;a href=\"free%20trade%20zone\"&gt;free trade zone&lt;/a&gt;s\". However, the line between \"recuperation\" and \"d\u00e9tournement\" can become thin (or at least very fuzzy) at times, as &lt;a href=\"Naomi%20Klein\"&gt;Naomi Klein&lt;/a&gt; points out in her book \"&lt;a href=\"No%20Logo\"&gt;No Logo&lt;/a&gt;\". Here she details how &lt;a href=\"corporation\"&gt;corporation&lt;/a&gt;s such as Nike, &lt;a href=\"Pepsi\"&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; or Diesel have approached Culture Jammers and Adbusters and offered them lucrative contracts in return for partaking in \"ironic\" promotional campaigns. She points out further irony by drawing attention to merchandising produced in order to promote Adbusters' &lt;a href=\"Buy%20Nothing%20Day\"&gt;Buy Nothing Day&lt;/a&gt;, an example of the recuperation of d\u00e9tournement if ever there was one.\nKlein's arguments about irony &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Areify\"&gt;reifying&lt;/a&gt; rather than breaking down power structures are echoed by &lt;a href=\"Slavoj%20%C5%BDi%C5%BEek\"&gt;Slavoj \u017di\u017eek&lt;/a&gt;. \u017di\u017eek argues that the kind of distance opened up by d\u00e9tournement is the condition of possibility for ideology to operate: by attacking and distancing oneself from the sign-systems of capital, the subject creates a fantasy of transgression that \"covers up\" their actual complicity with capitalism as an overarching system. In contrast, scholars are very fond of pointing out the differences between &lt;a href=\"hypergraphics\"&gt;hypergraphics&lt;/a&gt;, \"detournement\", the &lt;a href=\"postmodern\"&gt;postmodern&lt;/a&gt; idea of &lt;a href=\"cultural%20appropriation\"&gt;appropriation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Neoist\"&gt;Neoist&lt;/a&gt; use of &lt;a href=\"plagiarism\"&gt;plagiarism&lt;/a&gt; as the use of different and similar techniques used for different and similar means, effects and causes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Neue%20Slowenische%20Kunst\"&gt;Neue Slowenische Kunst&lt;/a&gt; has a long history of aggressive d\u00e9tournement of extreme political ideologies, as do several &lt;a href=\"industrial%20music\"&gt;industrial music groups&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Die%20Krupps\"&gt;Die Krupps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nitzer%20Ebb\"&gt;Nitzer Ebb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KMFDM\"&gt;KMFDM&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Front%20242\"&gt;Front 242&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Chris%20Morris%20%28satirist%29\"&gt;Chris Morris&lt;/a&gt; uses d\u00e9tournement and &lt;a href=\"culture%20jamming\"&gt;culture jamming&lt;/a&gt; extensively in his work, particularly in the British television series \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Day%20Today\"&gt;The Day Today&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Brass%20Eye\"&gt;Brass Eye&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;-based platform InEnArt, on the occasion of the &lt;a href=\"Istanbul%20Biennial\"&gt;13th Istanbul Biennial&lt;/a&gt; 2013, launched a forum titled Urban Voices focusing on phenomena that are turning expressions of the system and its media culture against itself. The authors of InEnArt regularly publish different phenomena of d\u00e9tournement and invite the online community to participate by uploading similar examples."
