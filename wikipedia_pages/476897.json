    "text": "Mikl\u00f3s \"Mickey\" Hargitay (January 6, 1926 \u2013 September 14, 2006) was a Hungarian-American actor and the &lt;a href=\"Universe%20Championships\"&gt;1955 Mr. Universe&lt;/a&gt;. Born in &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;, Hargitay moved to the United States in 1947, where he eventually became a citizen. He was married to actress &lt;a href=\"Jayne%20Mansfield\"&gt;Jayne Mansfield&lt;/a&gt; and is the father of actress &lt;a href=\"Mariska%20Hargitay\"&gt;Mariska Hargitay&lt;/a&gt;. During their marriage, Hargitay and Mansfield made four movies together: \"&lt;a href=\"Will%20Success%20Spoil%20Rock%20Hunter%3F\"&gt;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&lt;/a&gt;\" (1957), \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Loves%20of%20Hercules\"&gt;The Loves of Hercules&lt;/a&gt;\" (1960), \"&lt;a href=\"Promises%21%20Promises%21\"&gt;Promises! Promises!&lt;/a&gt;\" (1963), and \"&lt;a href=\"L%27Amore%20Primitivo\"&gt;L'Amore Primitivo&lt;/a&gt;\" (1964).\nEarly life and sports career.\nHargitay was born in &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest, Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, one of four children of an athletic father. He and his brothers were all brought up as athletes. During his youth, Hargitay was part of an acrobatic act with his brothers. The act was significantly popular that they performed throughout all Hungary, including the largest opera house in Budapest. After being introduced to the sport by his brother, Hargitay began competing in &lt;a href=\"speed%20skating\"&gt;speed skating&lt;/a&gt;. In 1946, he won the Middle European championship at 500 and 1,500 meters, and placed second in the 5,000 meter race. He was also a proficient &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player, and was an underground fighter during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1947, Hargitay left Hungary to emigrate to the United States. He settled in &lt;a href=\"Cleveland\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, where he met and married his first wife, fellow acrobat Mary Birge. Hargitay had one child with Birge, a daughter named Tina, who was born in 1949. He worked as a plumber and carpenter, and also performed in an acrobatic act with Birge. He was inspired to begin &lt;a href=\"bodybuilding\"&gt;bodybuilding&lt;/a&gt; after seeing a magazine cover featuring &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Reeves\"&gt;Steve Reeves&lt;/a&gt;, famed for playing &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt;. Hargitay became &lt;a href=\"National%20Amateur%20Body-Builders%27%20Association\"&gt;National Amateur Body-Builders' Association&lt;/a&gt; (NABBA) &lt;a href=\"Universe%20Championships\"&gt;Mr. Universe&lt;/a&gt; in 1955. After winning Mr. Universe and divorcing Birge, Hargitay joined &lt;a href=\"Mae%20West\"&gt;Mae West&lt;/a&gt;'s muscleman revue at New York's &lt;a href=\"Latin%20Quarter%20%28nightclub%29\"&gt;Latin Quarter&lt;/a&gt;, where he met &lt;a href=\"Jayne%20Mansfield\"&gt;Jayne Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;, whom he married in 1958. He is the first recipient of the &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Weider\"&gt;Joe Weider&lt;/a&gt; Lifetime Achievement Award.\nActing career.\nHargitay's first film role came when Jayne Mansfield demanded he be cast in her movie, \"&lt;a href=\"Will%20Success%20Spoil%20Rock%20Hunter%3F\"&gt;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&lt;/a&gt;\" (1957). The two had met the year before at \"The &lt;a href=\"Mae%20West\"&gt;Mae West&lt;/a&gt; Show\" at the Latin Quarter. When Mansfield noticed Hargitay performing, she allegedly told the waiter, \"I'll have a steak and that tall man on the left.\" The two fell in love, and were described as inseparable. &lt;a href=\"20th%20Century%20Fox\"&gt;20th Century Fox&lt;/a&gt; didn't want Hargitay in \"Rock Hunter\", because they disliked Mansfield's view of Hargitay as her \"only\" lover; Fox preferred their &lt;a href=\"sex%20symbol\"&gt;sex symbol&lt;/a&gt;s to be single.\nIn 1960, Hargitay and Mansfield played the lead roles in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Loves%20of%20Hercules\"&gt;The Loves of Hercules&lt;/a&gt;\". The film was shot in Italy, and has never been released in movie theaters in the United States, though it is available on &lt;a href=\"Netflix\"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; under the title \"Hercules vs. Hydra\", and under its original title as episode 1108 of \"&lt;a href=\"Mystery%20Science%20Theater%203000\"&gt;Mystery Science Theater 3000&lt;/a&gt;\", released in 2017. Over the next four years, Hargitay and Mansfield would appear together in \"&lt;a href=\"Promises%21%20Promises%21\"&gt;Promises! Promises!&lt;/a&gt;\" (1963) and \"&lt;a href=\"L%27Amore%20Primitivo\"&gt;L'Amore Primitivo&lt;/a&gt;\" (1964). In 1965, Hargitay played the lead role in \"&lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Pit%20of%20Horror\"&gt;Bloody Pit of Horror&lt;/a&gt;\" without Mansfield.\nHargitay's acting career wasn't limited to the United States; he also appeared in many Italian productions, and acted in Hungarian director &lt;a href=\"Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Szomjas\"&gt;Gy\u00f6rgy Szomjas&lt;/a&gt;' 1988 film, \"Mr. Universe\".\nIn 2003, Hargitay made his final acting appearance on \"\", the series in which his daughter &lt;a href=\"Mariska%20Hargitay\"&gt;Mariska&lt;/a&gt; stars. In the episode, titled \"Control\", Hargitay played a man who witnessed the aftermath of a brutal assault on a subway station escalator. He and his daughter are seen together on screen when Mariska's character, &lt;a href=\"Olivia%20Benson\"&gt;Olivia Benson&lt;/a&gt;, is interviewing his character.\nPersonal life.\nHargitay and Jayne Mansfield met in 1956, when he was performing in \"The Mae West Show\" at the Latin Quarter. The couple married on January 13, 1958. They had three children: Mikl\u00f3s Jeffrey Palmer Hargitay (b. December 21, 1958), Zolt\u00e1n Anthony Hargitay (b. August 1, 1960), and &lt;a href=\"Mariska%20Hargitay\"&gt;Mariska Magdolina Hargitay&lt;/a&gt; (b. January 23, 1964). Hargitay remodeled much of his and Mansfield's &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Hills%2C%20California\"&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt; mansion, known as \"&lt;a href=\"Jayne%20Mansfield%27s%20Pink%20Palace\"&gt;The Pink Palace&lt;/a&gt;\", building its famous heart-shaped swimming pool. In November 2002, the house was razed by developers who had purchased it from &lt;a href=\"Engelbert%20Humperdinck%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Engelbert Humperdinck&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May 1963, Hargitay and Mansfield filed for divorce in &lt;a href=\"Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez\"&gt;Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez&lt;/a&gt;. The divorce was ruled invalid, and the two reconciled in October 1963. After Mariska's birth, Mansfield sued for the Ju\u00e1rez divorce to be declared legal, and ultimately won. The divorce was recognized in the United States on August 26, 1964. After Mansfield's death in a car crash on June 29, 1967, Hargitay sued Mansfield's estate for over $5,000 to support the children. In their divorce decree, Mansfield had agreed to pay child support, as well as to give Hargitay approximately $70,000 in cash and property.\nHargitay married Ellen Siano in 1967. Hargitay and Siano remained married until his death.\nDeath.\nOn September 14, 2006, Hargitay died in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;, aged 80, from &lt;a href=\"multiple%20myeloma\"&gt;multiple myeloma&lt;/a&gt;. The \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Times\"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;\" noted in Hargitay's obituary:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Walter%20Winchell\"&gt;Walter Winchell&lt;/a&gt; once said that what [President] Eisenhower did for golf, Mickey Hargitay did for bodybuilding, because he brought it to the forefront,\" Gene Mozee, a bodybuilding historian and writer for \"Iron Man\" magazine, told \"The Times\" on Monday. \"Back in those days, bodybuilding was thought of as a freakish, unusual activity that wasn't popular with the general public,\" Mozee said. \"At that time, athletic coaches discouraged lifting weights, thinking you'd become musclebound. And along came Mickey Hargitay, a great all-around athlete.\nIn popular culture.\nHargitay was portrayed by &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Schwarzenegger\"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980 television film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jayne%20Mansfield%20Story\"&gt;The Jayne Mansfield Story&lt;/a&gt;\"."
