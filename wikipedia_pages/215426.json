    "text": "Sir Bernard Katz, &lt;a href=\"Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society\"&gt;FRS&lt;/a&gt; (; 26 March 1911 \u2013 20 April 2003) was a German-born &lt;a href=\"British%20people\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; physician and &lt;a href=\"biophysics\"&gt;biophysicist&lt;/a&gt;, noted for his work on &lt;a href=\"nerve\"&gt;nerve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"physiology\"&gt;physiology&lt;/a&gt;. He shared the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine\"&gt;Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine&lt;/a&gt; in 1970 with &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Axelrod\"&gt;Julius Axelrod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulf%20von%20Euler\"&gt;Ulf von Euler&lt;/a&gt;. He was made a &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Bachelor\"&gt;Knight Bachelor&lt;/a&gt; in 1969.\nLife and career.\nKatz was born in &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, to a Jewish family originally from Russia, the son of Eugenie (Rabinowitz) and Max Katz, a fur merchant. He was educated at the Albert Gymnasium in that city from 1921 to 1929 and went on to study medicine at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Leipzig\"&gt;University of Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated in 1934 and fled to Britain in February 1935.\nKatz went to work at &lt;a href=\"University%20College%20London\"&gt;University College London&lt;/a&gt;, initially under the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Archibald%20Vivian%20Hill\"&gt;Archibald Vivian Hill&lt;/a&gt;. He finished his PhD in 1938 and won a &lt;a href=\"Carnegie%20Fellowship\"&gt;Carnegie Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; to study with &lt;a href=\"John%20Carew%20Eccles\"&gt;John Carew Eccles&lt;/a&gt; at the Kanematsu Institute of &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Medical%20School\"&gt;Sydney Medical School&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, both he and Eccles gave research lectures at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Sydney\"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. He obtained British nationality in 1941 and joined the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Australian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; in 1942. He spent the war in the Pacific as a &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; officer and in 1946 was invited back to UCL as an assistant director by &lt;a href=\"A%20V%20Hill\"&gt;Hill&lt;/a&gt;. For three years until 1949, the Katz family lived with &lt;a href=\"A%20V%20Hill\"&gt;Hill&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Hill%20%28social%20reformer%29\"&gt;Margaret&lt;/a&gt; in the top flat of their house in &lt;a href=\"Highgate\"&gt;Highgate&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack in England he also worked with the 1963 Nobel prize winners &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Hodgkin\"&gt;Alan Hodgkin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Huxley\"&gt;Andrew Huxley&lt;/a&gt;. Katz was made a professor at UCL in 1952 and head of biophysics, he was elected a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Fellows%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20elected%20in%201952\"&gt;Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1952&lt;/a&gt;. He stayed as head of biophysics until 1978 when he became emeritus professor.\nKatz married Marguerite Penly in 1945. He died in London on 20 April 2003, at the age of 92. His son Jonathan is &lt;a href=\"Public%20Orator\"&gt;Public Orator&lt;/a&gt; of The &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;.\nResearch.\nHis research uncovered fundamental properties of &lt;a href=\"synapse\"&gt;synapse&lt;/a&gt;s, the junctions across which nerve cells signal to each other and to other types of cells. By the 1950s, he was studying the biochemistry and action of &lt;a href=\"acetylcholine\"&gt;acetylcholine&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"neurotransmitter\"&gt;signalling molecule&lt;/a&gt; found in synapses linking &lt;a href=\"motor%20neuron\"&gt;motor neuron&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"muscle\"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt;s, used to stimulate contraction. Katz won the Nobel for his discovery with &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Fatt\"&gt;Paul Fatt&lt;/a&gt; that neurotransmitter release at synapses is \"&lt;a href=\"Quantal%20neurotransmitter%20release\"&gt;quantal&lt;/a&gt;\", meaning that at any particular synapse, the amount of neurotransmitter released is never less than a certain amount, and if more is always an integral number times this amount. Scientists now understand that this circumstance arises because, prior to their release into the synaptic gap, transmitter molecules reside in like-sized subcellular packages known as &lt;a href=\"synaptic%20vesicle\"&gt;synaptic vesicle&lt;/a&gt;s, released in a similar way to any other &lt;a href=\"vesicle%20%28biology%29\"&gt;vesicle&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"exocytosis\"&gt;exocytosis&lt;/a&gt;.\nKatz's work had immediate influence on the study of &lt;a href=\"organophosphate\"&gt;organophosphate&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"organochlorine\"&gt;organochlorine&lt;/a&gt;s, the basis of new post-war study for &lt;a href=\"nerve%20agent\"&gt;nerve agent&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pesticide\"&gt;pesticide&lt;/a&gt;s, as he determined that the complex enzyme cycle was easily disrupted."
