    "text": "Caro is a &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in and the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tuscola%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Tuscola County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The population was 4,328 at the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%2C%202020\"&gt;2020 census&lt;/a&gt; and 4,145 at the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%2C%202000\"&gt;2000 census&lt;/a&gt; (an increase of 4.4%).\nCaro is located northeast of &lt;a href=\"Flint%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Flint&lt;/a&gt; and east of &lt;a href=\"Saginaw%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Saginaw&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan's &lt;a href=\"The%20Thumb\"&gt;Upper Thumb region&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCaro began as a logging camp on the Cass River established by Curtis Emerson in 1847.\nLater Samuel P. Sherman, who purchased in the north half of the northwest quarter of &lt;a href=\"section%20%28the%20United%20States%20land%20surveying%29\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; 3 in &lt;a href=\"Indianfields%20Township%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Indianfields Township&lt;/a&gt; on September 8, 1852. Prior to this, only two land sales had been recorded, both for lumbering or speculative purposes. His son, William E. Sherman, had worked in the lumber industry nearby on the &lt;a href=\"Cass%20River%20%28Michigan%29\"&gt;Cass River&lt;/a&gt; for some time prior to 1852 and William's favorable report persuaded his father to visit in 1851 and afterward purchased several tracts of land in addition to his initial purchase.\nIn the 1856-57 session of the Michigan Legislature, construction of a road was authorized from &lt;a href=\"Bridgeport%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Bridgeport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Saginaw%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Saginaw County&lt;/a&gt; northeast to &lt;a href=\"Forestville%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Forestville&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sanilac%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Sanilac County&lt;/a&gt;, with a route that would pass through what is now Caro. Once the road was cleared, commercial interests began to locate here. Melvin Gibbs, who had been keeping a hotel in an old log house, in 1858 put up a new frame building, known as the Gibbs House. In 1859, William E. Sherman built another hotel, which he named the Centerville House, based on the location being near the center of the county. The name Centerville became associated with the developing community.\nIn 1865, Centerville was selected as the county seat. A post office named Tuscola Center was established on April 25, 1866. To address the confusion caused by the differing names, community leaders met in 1868, and at the suggestion of William, E Sherman selected the name Caro, based on a variant spelling of the Egyptian city of &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 23, 2007, Governor &lt;a href=\"Jennifer%20Granholm\"&gt;Jennifer Granholm&lt;/a&gt; announced Caro as a community chosen by the Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) to take part in the Blueprints for Downtowns program. Caro will receive a comprehensive, market-driven strategy toward developing an action-oriented downtown that will result in economic growth, job creation and private investments.\nCaro residents voted in favor of changing to the status of a city on November 3, 2009. Village President Tom Striffler was elected to the position of &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt;. Elected to the city council were Mike Henry, Rick Lipan, Joe Greene, Charlotte Kish, Amanda Langmaid, and Richard Pouliot. The first meeting of the new city council was held on November 13.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nCaro is located in central &lt;a href=\"Tuscola%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Tuscola County&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Indianfields%20Township%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Indianfields Township&lt;/a&gt; on its west, south, and east. &lt;a href=\"Almer%20Township%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Almer Township&lt;/a&gt; surrounds the northern part of the city.
