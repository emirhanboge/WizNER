    "text": "Fischer random chess, also known as Chess960, is a &lt;a href=\"Chess%20variant\"&gt;variation&lt;/a&gt; of the game of &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; invented by the former &lt;a href=\"World%20Chess%20Championship%201972\"&gt;World Chess Champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Fischer\"&gt;Bobby Fischer&lt;/a&gt;. Fischer announced this variation on June 19, 1996, in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, Argentina. Fischer random chess employs the same &lt;a href=\"chessboard\"&gt;board&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chess%20piece\"&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; as classical chess, but the starting position of the pieces on the players' is randomized, following certain rules. The random setup makes gaining an advantage through the memorization of &lt;a href=\"Chess%20opening\"&gt;openings&lt;/a&gt; impracticable; players instead must rely more on their skill and creativity .\nRandomizing the main pieces had long been known as \"shuffle chess\", but Fischer random chess introduces new rules for the initial random setup, \"preserving the dynamic nature of the game by retaining for each player and the right to &lt;a href=\"castling%20%28chess%29\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; for both sides\". The result is 960 unique possible starting positions.\nIn 2008, &lt;a href=\"FIDE\"&gt;FIDE&lt;/a&gt; added Chess960 to an appendix of the Laws of Chess. The first world championship officially sanctioned by FIDE, the &lt;a href=\"FIDE%20World%20Fischer%20Random%20Chess%20Championship%202019\"&gt;FIDE World Fischer Random Chess Championship 2019&lt;/a&gt;, brought additional prominence to the variant.\nSetup.\nBefore the game, a starting position is randomly determined and set up, subject to certain requirements. White's pieces (not pawns) are placed randomly on the first , following two rules:\n&lt;a href=\"White%20and%20Black%20in%20chess\"&gt;Black's&lt;/a&gt; pieces are placed equal-and-opposite to White's pieces. (For example, if the white king is randomly determined to start on f1, then the black king is placed on f8.) Pawns are placed on the players' second ranks as in classical chess.\nAfter setup, the game is played the same as &lt;a href=\"Rules%20of%20chess\"&gt;classical chess&lt;/a&gt; in all respects, with the exception of castling from the different possible starting positions for king and rooks.\nCreating starting positions.\nUsually, the players accept the conditions of the organizer to generate the starting position with software, as it was used in the &lt;a href=\"FIDE%20World%20Fischer%20Random%20Chess%20Championship%202019\"&gt;2019 World Fischer Random Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the software is not available or the players don't accept it, there are several procedures for generating random starting positions with equal probability.\nThere are 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 1 = 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1 = 960\nlegal starting positions:\n4 possible squares for the light-squared bishop\n4 possible squares for the dark-squared bishop\n6 remaining squares for the queen and 5! / (3! \u00d7 2!) = 5 \u00d7 4 / 2 = 10 ways to place the two (identical) knights on the remaining 5 squares\nor\n6! / (4! \u00d7 2!) = 5 \u00d7 6 / 2 = 15 ways to place the two (identical) knights on the remaining 6 squares and 4 remaining squares for the queen\n1 way to place the two rooks and king on the remaining 3 squares, since the king must be between the rooks.\nIn 1998, &lt;a href=\"Ingo%20Alth%C3%B6fer\"&gt;Ingo Alth\u00f6fer&lt;/a&gt; proposed a method that requires only a single standard &lt;a href=\"Dice\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;. (Re-roll if needed to get values in the range 1\u20134 or 1\u20135).\nIf a full set of &lt;a href=\"Polyhedral%20dice%23Non-cubical%20dice\"&gt;polyhedral dice&lt;/a&gt; is available (a &lt;a href=\"tetrahedron\"&gt;tetrahedron&lt;/a&gt; (d4), &lt;a href=\"cube%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;cube&lt;/a&gt; (d6), &lt;a href=\"octahedron\"&gt;octahedron&lt;/a&gt; (d8), &lt;a href=\"dodecahedron\"&gt;dodecahedron&lt;/a&gt; (d12), and an &lt;a href=\"icosahedron\"&gt;icosahedron&lt;/a&gt; (d20)), one never needs to reroll any dice.\nTossing a coin to create binary numbers and convert them to decimal.\nShuffling objects (cards, pieces, pawns, dominoes tiles, scrabble letters) and use the permutations.\nSince all 960 starting positions have been assigned a number (per the &lt;a href=\"Fischer%20Random%20Chess%20numbering%20scheme\"&gt;Fischer Random Chess numbering scheme&lt;/a&gt;) any method that generates a random number between 0 and 959 can be used to generate a starting position.\nCastling rules.\nAs in classical chess, each player may &lt;a href=\"castling\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; once per game, moving both the king and a rook in a single move; however, the castling rules were reinterpreted in Fischer random chess to support the different possible initial positions of king and rook. After castling, the final positions of king and rook are exactly the same as in classical chess, namely:\nCastling prerequisites are the same as in classical chess, namely:\nFIDE's recommended procedure for castling unambiguously is first to move the king outside the playing area next to its final square, then to move the rook to its final square, then to move the king to its final square. Another recommendation is to verbally announce the intent to castle before doing so.\nObservations.\nIn some starting positions, squares can remain occupied during castling that would be required to be vacant under classical rules. Castling a-side (0-0-0) could still be possible despite the home rank a-, b-, or e-file squares being occupied, and similarly for the e- and h-files for h-side castling (0-0). In other positions, it can happen that the king or rook does not move during the castling maneuver since it already occupies its destination square \u2013 e.g., an h-side rook that starts on the f-file; in this case, only the king moves. No initial position allows a castling where neither piece moves, as the king must start between the rooks.\nAnother unusual possibility is for castling to be available as the first move of the game, as happened in the 11th game of the tournament match between &lt;a href=\"Hikaru%20Nakamura\"&gt;Hikaru Nakamura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Carlsen\"&gt;Magnus Carlsen&lt;/a&gt;, Fischer Random Blitz 2018. The starting position had kings at f1/f8 and h-side rooks at g1/g8. Both players took the opportunity to castle on the first move (1.0-0 0-0).\nTheory.\nThe study of openings in Fischer random chess is in its infancy, but fundamental &lt;a href=\"Chess%20opening%23Aims%20of%20the%20opening\"&gt;opening principles&lt;/a&gt; still apply, including: protect the king, control the central squares (directly or indirectly), and develop rapidly, starting with the less valuable pieces. Unprotected pawns may also need to be dealt with quickly. The majority of starting positions have unprotected pawns, and some starting positions have up to two that can be attacked on the first move (see diagram). The &lt;a href=\"Stockfish%20%28chess%29\"&gt;Stockfish&lt;/a&gt; program rates the Fischer random chess opening positions between 0.00 and 0.57 pawns advantage for White, while the mean value for the same in classical chess is 0.2.\nIt has been argued that two games should be played from each starting position, with players alternating colors, since &lt;a href=\"First-move%20advantage%20in%20chess\"&gt;the advantage offered to White&lt;/a&gt; by some initial positions may be greater than in classical chess. For example, in some Fischer random chess starting positions, White can attack an unprotected black pawn on the first move, whereas in classical chess it takes two moves for White to attack, and there are no unprotected pawns.\nHistory.\nFischer random chess is a variant of shuffle chess, which had been suggested as early as 1792 with games played as early as 1842.\nFischer's modification \"imposes certain restrictions, arguably an improvement on the anarchy of the fully randomized game in which one player is almost certain to start at an advantage\". Fischer started to develop his new version of chess after the &lt;a href=\"Fischer%E2%80%93Spassky%20%281992%20match%29\"&gt;1992 return match with Boris Spassky&lt;/a&gt;. The result was the formulation of the rules of Fischer random chess in September 1993, introduced formally to the public on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DkwQ3bpEhW6I\"&gt;Fischer describes the rules here.&lt;/a&gt;\nFischer's goal was to eliminate what he considered the complete dominance of openings preparation in classical chess, replacing it with creativity and talent. In a situation where the starting position was random it would be impossible to fix every move of the game. Since the \"opening book\" for 960 possible opening systems would be too difficult to devote to memory, the players must create every move originally. From the first move, both players must devise original strategies and cannot use well-established patterns. Fischer believed that eliminating memorized book moves would level the playing field.\nDuring the summer of 1993, Bobby Fischer visited &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Polg%C3%A1r\"&gt;L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Polg\u00e1r&lt;/a&gt; and his family in Hungary. All of the Polgar sisters (&lt;a href=\"Judit%20Polg%C3%A1r\"&gt;Judit Polg\u00e1r&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Susan%20Polgar\"&gt;Susan Polgar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sofia%20Polgar\"&gt;Sofia Polgar&lt;/a&gt;) played many games of Fischer random chess with Fischer. At one point Sofia beat Fischer three games in a row. Fischer was not pleased when the father, L\u00e1szl\u00f3, showed Fischer an old chess book that described what appeared to be a forerunner of Fischer random chess. The book was written by &lt;a href=\"Izidor%20Gross\"&gt;Izidor Gross&lt;/a&gt; and published in 1910. Fischer then changed the rules of his variation in order to make it different.\nTournaments.\nMainz Championships.\n\"Note: None of the Mainz championships were recognized by &lt;a href=\"FIDE\"&gt;FIDE&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, they were all played with rapid time controls.\"\nComputers.\nIn 2005, chess program &lt;a href=\"The%20Baron%20%28chess%20program%29\"&gt;The Baron&lt;/a&gt; played two Fischer random chess games against Chess960 World Champion &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Svidler\"&gt;Peter Svidler&lt;/a&gt;, who won 1\u00bd\u2013\u00bd. The chess program &lt;a href=\"Shredder%20%28chess%29\"&gt;Shredder&lt;/a&gt;, developed by Stefan Meyer-Kahlen of Germany, played two games against &lt;a href=\"Zolt%C3%A1n%20Alm%C3%A1si\"&gt;Zolt\u00e1n Alm\u00e1si&lt;/a&gt; from Hungary, where Shredder won 2\u20130.\nMatches.\nFrom February 9 to 13, 2018, a Fischer random chess match between reigning classical World Chess Champion &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Carlsen\"&gt;Magnus Carlsen&lt;/a&gt; and the unofficial Fischer random chess world champion &lt;a href=\"Hikaru%20Nakamura\"&gt;Hikaru Nakamura&lt;/a&gt; was held in &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B8vikodden\"&gt;H\u00f8vikodden&lt;/a&gt;, Norway. The match consisted of 8 rapid and 8 blitz games, with the rapid games counting double. Each position was used in two games, with colors reversed. Carlsen prevailed with a score of 14\u201310.\nFrom September 11 to 14, 2018, the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Louis%20Chess%20Club\"&gt;Saint Louis Chess Club&lt;/a&gt; held a Fischer random chess event. The playing format included five individual matches, each pair of players facing the same five different starting positions, with 6 rapid games (counting 2 points each) and 14 blitz games (counting 1 point each). \"The players and scores:\" &lt;a href=\"Veselin%20Topalov\"&gt;Veselin Topalov&lt;/a&gt; (14\u00bd\u201311\u00bd) defeated &lt;a href=\"Garry%20Kasparov\"&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/a&gt;; Hikaru Nakamura (14\u201312) defeated &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Svidler\"&gt;Peter Svidler&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Wesley%20So\"&gt;Wesley So&lt;/a&gt; (14\u00bd\u201311\u00bd) defeated &lt;a href=\"Anish%20Giri\"&gt;Anish Giri&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Maxime%20Vachier-Lagrave\"&gt;Maxime Vachier-Lagrave&lt;/a&gt; (17\u00bd\u20138\u00bd) defeated &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Shankland\"&gt;Sam Shankland&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Levon%20Aronian\"&gt;Levon Aronian&lt;/a&gt; (17\u00bd\u20138\u00bd) defeated &lt;a href=\"Leinier%20Dominguez\"&gt;Leinier Dominguez&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld Championship.\nThe first world championship in Fischer random chess officially recognized by FIDE were announced April 20, 2019, and ended on November 2, 2019. &lt;a href=\"Wesley%20So\"&gt;Wesley So&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Carlsen\"&gt;Magnus Carlsen&lt;/a&gt; 13\u00bd\u20132\u00bd in the last round, and became the first world champion in Fischer random chess.\nDuring the announcement FIDE president &lt;a href=\"Arkady%20Dvorkovich\"&gt;Arkady Dvorkovich&lt;/a&gt; commented: It is an unprecedented move that the International Chess Federation recognizes a new variety of chess, so this was a decision that required to be carefully thought out. But we believe that Fischer Random is a positive innovation: It injects new energies and enthusiasm into our game, but at the same time it doesn't mean a rupture with our classical chess and its tradition. It is probably for this reason that Fischer Random chess has won the favor of the chess community, including the top players and the world champion himself. FIDE couldn't be oblivious to that: It was time to embrace and incorporate this modality of chess.\nNaming.\nThe variant has held a number of different names. It was originally known as \"Fischerandom\", the name given by Fischer. Fischer random chess is the official term, used by &lt;a href=\"FIDE\"&gt;FIDE&lt;/a&gt;.\nHans-Walter Schmitt, chairman of the Frankfurt Chess Tigers e.V. and an advocate of the variant, started a brainstorming\nprocess for creating a new name, which had to meet the requirements of leading grandmasters; specifically, the new name and its parts:\nThe effort culminated in the name choice \"Chess960\"\u00a0\u2013 derived from the number of different possible starting positions. Fischer never publicly expressed an opinion on the name \"Chess960\".\nReinhard Scharnagl, another proponent of the variant, advocated the term \"FullChess\". Today he uses FullChess, however, to refer to variants which consistently embed classical chess (e.g. Chess960 and similar variants). He recommends the name Chess960 for the variant in preference to Fischer random chess.\nIt is known as Chess9LX, by the Saint Louis Chess Club\nCoding games and positions.\nRecorded games must convey the Fischer random chess starting position. Games recorded using the &lt;a href=\"Portable%20Game%20Notation\"&gt;Portable Game Notation&lt;/a&gt; (PGN) can record the initial position using &lt;a href=\"Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards%20Notation\"&gt;Forsyth\u2013Edwards Notation&lt;/a&gt; (FEN), as the value of the \"FEN\" tag. Castling is notated the same as in classical chess (except PGN requires letter \"O\" not number \"0\"). Note that not all chess programs can handle castling correctly in Fischer random chess games. To correctly record a Fischer random chess game in PGN, an additional \"Variant\" tag (not \"Variation\" tag, which has a different meaning) must be used to identify the rules; the rule named \"Fischerandom\" is accepted by many chess programs as identifying Fischer random chess, though \"Chess960\" should be accepted as well. This means that in a PGN-recorded game, one of the PGN tags (after the initial seven tags) would look like this: [Variant \"Fischerandom\"].\nFEN is capable of expressing all possible \"starting\" positions of Fischer random chess; however, unmodified &lt;a href=\"Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards%20Notation\"&gt;FEN&lt;/a&gt; cannot express all possible positions of a Chess960 game. In a game, a rook may move into the back row on the same side of the king as the other rook, or pawn(s) may be underpromoted into rook(s) and moved into the back row. If a rook is unmoved and can still castle, yet there is more than one rook on that side, FEN notation as traditionally interpreted is ambiguous. This is because FEN records that castling is possible on that side, but not \"which\" rook is still allowed to castle.\nA modification of FEN, &lt;a href=\"X-FEN\"&gt;X-FEN&lt;/a&gt;, has been devised by Reinhard Scharnagl to remove this ambiguity. In X-FEN, the castling markings \"KQkq\" have their expected meanings: \"Q\" and \"q\" mean a-side castling is still legal (for White and Black respectively), and \"K\" and \"k\" mean h-side castling is still legal (for White and Black respectively). However, if there is more than one rook on the baseline on the same side of the king, and the rook that can castle is not the outermost rook on that side, then the file letter (uppercase for White) of the rook that can castle is used instead of \"K\", \"k\", \"Q\", or \"q\"; in X-FEN notation, castling potentials belong to the outermost rooks by default. The maximum length of the castling value is still four characters. X-FEN is upwardly compatible with FEN, that is, a program supporting X-FEN will automatically use the normal FEN codes for a traditional chess starting position without requiring any special programming. As a benefit all 18 pseudo FRC positions (positions with traditional placements of rooks and king) still remain uniquely encoded.\nThe solution implemented by chess engines like &lt;a href=\"Shredder%20%28chess%29\"&gt;Shredder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fritz%20%28chess%29\"&gt;Fritz&lt;/a&gt; is to use the letters of the columns on which the rooks began the game. This scheme is sometimes called Shredder-FEN. For the traditional setup, Shredder-FEN would use HAha instead of KQkq.\nViews of grandmasters.\nFischer's proposed \"new chess\" has elicited various comments from grandmasters.\nSimilar variants.\nThere are several variants based on randomization of the initial setup. \"Randomized Chess, in one or other of its many reincarnations, continues to attract support even, or perhaps especially, that of top players.\"\nRemarks\nShuffle chess\nThe castling is not possible in any case or is possible only when king and rook are on their traditional starting squares.\nChess2880\nThe castling is possible as follows:\nAfter castling with the nearest rook to the column:\nChess480\nIn \"Castling in Chess960: An appeal for simplicity\", John Kipling Lewis proposes alternative castling rules which Lewis has named \"Orthodoxed Castling\".\nThe preconditions for castling are the same as in Chess960, but when castling, [...] the king is transferred from its original square two squares towards (or over) the rook, then that rook is transferred to the square the king has just crossed (if it is not already there). If the king and rook are adjacent in a corner and the king cannot move two spaces over the rook, then the king and rook exchange squares.\nUnlike Fischer random chess, the final position after castling in Chess480 will usually \"not\" be the same as the final position of a castling move in traditional chess. Lewis argues that this alternative better conforms to how the castling move was historically developed.\nLewis has named this chess variation \"Chess480\"; it follows the rules of Chess960 with the exception of the castling rules. Although a Chess480 game can start with any of 960 starting positions, the castling rules are symmetrical (whereas the Chess960 castling rules are not), so that mirror-image positions have identical strategies; thus there are only 480 \"effectively\" different positions. The number of starting positions could be reduced to 480 without losing any possibilities, for example by requiring the white king to start on a light (or dark) square.\nThere are other claims to the nomenclature \"Chess480\"; Reinhard Scharnagl defines it as the white queen is always to the left of the white king.\nDavid O'Shaughnessy argues in \"Castling in Chess480: An appeal for sanity\" that the Chess480 rules are often not useful from a gameplay perspective. In about 66% of starting positions, players have the options of castling deeper into the wing the king started on, or castling into the center of the board (when the king starts on the b-, c-, f-, or g-files). From Wikipedia article &lt;a href=\"Castling\"&gt;Castling&lt;/a&gt;: \"Castling is an important goal in the early part of a game, because it serves two valuable purposes: it moves the king into a safer position away from the center of the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position in the center of the board.\" An example of poor castling options is a position where the kings start on g1 and g8 respectively. There will be no possibility of \"opposite-side castling\" where each player's pawns are free to be used in , as the kings' scope for movement is very restricted (it can only move to the h- or e-file). These \"problem positions\" play well with Chess960 castling rules.\nNon-random setups\nThe initial setup need not necessarily be random.\nThe players or a tournament setting may decide on a specific position in advance, for example. Tournament Directors prefer that all boards in a single round play the same random position, as to maintain order and abbreviate the setup time for each round.\nEdward Northam suggests the following approach for allowing players to jointly create a position without randomizing tools: First, the back ranks are cleared of pieces, and the white bishops, knights, and queen are gathered together. Starting with Black, the players, in turn, place one of these pieces on White's back rank, where it must stay. The only restriction is that the bishops must go on opposite-color squares. There will be a vacant square of the required color for the second bishop, no matter where the previous pieces have been placed. Some variety could be introduced into this process by allowing each player to exercise a one-time option of moving a piece already on the board instead of putting a new piece on the board. After all five pieces have been put on the board, the king must be placed on the middle of the three vacant back rank squares that remain. Rooks go on the other two.\nThis approach to the opening setup has much in common with Pre-Chess, the variant in which White and Black, alternately and independently, fill in their respective back ranks. Pre-Chess could be played with the additional requirement of ending up with a legal Fischer random chess opening position. A chess clock could even be used during this phase as well as during normal play.\nWithout some limitation on which pieces go on the board first, it is possible to reach impasse positions, which cannot be completed to legal Fischer random chess starting positions. Example: Q.RB.N.N If the players want to work with all eight pieces, they must have a prior agreement about how to correct illegal opening positions that may arise. If the bishops end up on same color squares, a simple action, such as moving the a-side bishop one square toward the h-file, might be agreeable, since there is no question of preserving randomness. Once the bishops are on opposite-color squares, if the king is not between the rooks, it should trade places with the nearest rook.\nReferences.\nBibliography"
