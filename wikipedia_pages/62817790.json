    "text": "SMS \"W\u00fcrttemberg\" was the fourth and final member of the s ordered but never finished for the German \"&lt;a href=\"Kaiserliche%20Marine\"&gt;Kaiserliche Marine&lt;/a&gt;\" (Imperial Navy) in the 1910s, sometimes considered to be part of a sub-class with her sister . She was to be armed with the same &lt;a href=\"main%20battery\"&gt;main battery&lt;/a&gt; of eight guns in four &lt;a href=\"gun%20turret\"&gt;gun turret&lt;/a&gt;s. Originally intended to serve as a fleet &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt;, the start of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; in July 1914 forced the Navy to simplify her design in the hopes that she could be completed in time to see service during the conflict. She was &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; in January 1915 at the &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Krupp%20Germaniawerft\"&gt;Germaniawerft&lt;/a&gt; shipyard, but as resources were diverted to more pressing projects, including &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; construction, work on the ship slowed; she was &lt;a href=\"ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in June 1917, but only to clear the &lt;a href=\"slipway\"&gt;slipway&lt;/a&gt; for other work. By the time construction stopped, she was about twelve months from completion. The &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt; that ended the war in June 1919 specified that all warships under construction in Germany were to be destroyed, and \"W\u00fcrttemberg\" was accordingly sold for &lt;a href=\"scrap\"&gt;scrap&lt;/a&gt; in 1921 and &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;dismantled&lt;/a&gt; the following year.\nDevelopment.\nDesign work on the began in 1910 in the context of the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race\"&gt;Anglo-German naval arms race&lt;/a&gt;, with initial discussions focused on the caliber of the &lt;a href=\"main%20battery\"&gt;main battery&lt;/a&gt;; previous &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s had carried guns, but as foreign navies adopted and weapons, the German naval command felt the need to respond with larger guns of their own. They considered , , and guns. Admiral &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz\"&gt;Alfred von Tirpitz&lt;/a&gt;, the State Secretary of the \"&lt;a href=\"Reichsmarineamt\"&gt;Reichsmarineamt&lt;/a&gt;\" (RMA\u2014Imperial Naval Office), was able to use public outcry over the &lt;a href=\"Agadir%20Crisis\"&gt;Agadir Crisis&lt;/a&gt; to pressure the &lt;a href=\"Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29\"&gt;\"Reichstag\"&lt;/a&gt; (Imperial Diet) into appropriating additional funds for the \"Kaiserliche Marine\" (Imperial Navy) to offset the additional cost of the larger weapons. The design staff settled on the 38\u00a0cm caliber since the 40\u00a0cm was significantly more expensive and the 38\u00a0cm gun marked a significant improvement over existing German guns. The class was authorized under the fourth and final &lt;a href=\"German%20Naval%20Laws\"&gt;Naval Law&lt;/a&gt;, which was passed in 1912.\nAs work on the first two units of the class\u2014 and \u2014began, the design staff examined the latest developments in foreign warships and learned that the latest British battleships, the , would have a high top speed. This prompted them to alter the third member of the class, , to include a &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;. \"Sachsen\"s length increased to accommodate the larger engine, increasing displacement by about over the earlier members of the class. As work began on \"W\u00fcrttemberg\", the last member of the class, the designers intended to retain the increased dimensions while reverting to an all-&lt;a href=\"steam%20turbine\"&gt;steam turbine&lt;/a&gt; arrangement. The savings in weight would be used to improve \"W\u00fcrttemberg\"s armor layout. This proved to be impossible, because the decision was made to outfit the new vessel as a fleet &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt;, and the larger &lt;a href=\"bridge%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; necessary for an admiral's staff more than offset the reduction in weight. Indeed, the alterations forced the design staff to increase standard displacement by another 200\u00a0t. Cost of the new ships spiraled higher and higher; \"W\u00fcrttemberg\" amounted to an 8.6\u00a0percent increase over \"Sachsen\", which was in turn a 13\u00a0percent increase over the estimated costs for \"Bayern\" and \"Baden\".\nTirpitz presented the finalized design for the new ship to &lt;a href=\"German%20Emperor\"&gt;Kaiser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20II\"&gt;Wilhelm II&lt;/a&gt; for approval in June 1914, during the &lt;a href=\"Kiel%20Week\"&gt;Kiel Week&lt;/a&gt; sailing &lt;a href=\"regatta\"&gt;regatta&lt;/a&gt;, calculated to take advantage of Wilhelm's good mood to secure his approval for the skyrocketing price. Wilhelm registered no objection, but events were to rapidly force Tirpitz to rework the design. Later that month, &lt;a href=\"assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand\"&gt;Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was assassinated&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the &lt;a href=\"July%20Crisis\"&gt;July Crisis&lt;/a&gt; that started &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; in late July. On 2 August, Tirpitz issued instructions that \"W\u00fcrttemberg\" was to be completed as quickly as possible to strengthen the fleet now that the country was at war; the ship was to be completed identically to \"Sachsen\", albeit without the diesel engine, discarding the modifications to her bridge structure. The contract for the ship was quickly awarded to &lt;a href=\"AG%20Vulcan\"&gt;AG Vulcan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"W\u00fcrttemberg\" was &lt;a href=\"length%20at%20the%20waterline\"&gt;long at the waterline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;long overall&lt;/a&gt;. She had a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a draft of between . \"W\u00fcrttemberg\" would have &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; at her designed displacement, which did not include a full load of supplies, fuel, and other operational necessities; at &lt;a href=\"full%20load\"&gt;full load&lt;/a&gt;, she would have displaced up to . Though her sister \"Sachsen\" was to receive a diesel engine, \"W\u00fcrttemberg\" reverted to an all-steam turbine propulsion system like her earlier sisters. Steam for the engines was provided by nine coal-fired and three &lt;a href=\"fuel%20oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;-burning &lt;a href=\"water-tube%20boiler\"&gt;water-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s. The propulsion system was rated to produce for a maximum speed of . Her engines would have provided a cruising range of at a speed of . Upon commissioning, she would have carried a crew of 42 officers and 1,129 enlisted men.\nHad she been completed, the ship would have been armed with eight &lt;a href=\"38%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20%26quot%3BMax%26quot%3B\"&gt;SK L/45&lt;/a&gt; guns. These would have been arranged in four twin-&lt;a href=\"gun%20turret\"&gt;gun turret&lt;/a&gt;s: two &lt;a href=\"superfire\"&gt;superfiring&lt;/a&gt; turret pairs fore and aft of the &lt;a href=\"superstructure\"&gt;superstructure&lt;/a&gt;. Her &lt;a href=\"battleship%20secondary%20armament\"&gt;secondary armament&lt;/a&gt; was to have consisted of sixteen &lt;a href=\"15%20cm%20SK%20L/45\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt;. She would also have been fitted with five &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; tubes submerged in her hull, one in the bow and two on each &lt;a href=\"Broadside%20%28naval%29\"&gt;broadside&lt;/a&gt;. The ship had an &lt;a href=\"Belt%20armor\"&gt;armored belt&lt;/a&gt; that was thick and an armored deck that was thick. Her forward &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt; had sides, and the main battery turrets had 350\u00a0mm thick sides and thick roofs.\nConstruction and cancellation.\n\"W\u00fcrttemberg\", ordered under the provisional name \"Ersatz Kaiser Wilhelm II\" to replace the old &lt;a href=\"pre-dreadnought\"&gt;pre-dreadnought&lt;/a&gt; , was named for the earlier &lt;a href=\"ironclad%20warship\"&gt;ironclad corvette&lt;/a&gt; , which had been built in the 1870s. The ship had been scheduled for the 1915 fiscal year, but due to the start of the war, she was begun early using war funds. The contract that had been awarded to AG Vulcan was finalized on 29 December 1914, which specified the beginning of construction in January 1915, her &lt;a href=\"ship%20launching\"&gt;launching&lt;/a&gt; in mid-1916, and completion in early 1917. Her &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; on 4 January 1915 under &lt;a href=\"yard%20number\"&gt;yard number&lt;/a&gt; 386, and AG Vulcan intended to rush work on the ship as much as possible. But as resources and manpower were diverted to other, more pressing projects like the &lt;a href=\"U-boat%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;U-boat campaign&lt;/a&gt; against Britain, work on the ship slowed.\nBy December 1915, about 31\u00a0percent of her hull had been completed, which amounted to 60\u00a0percent of her outer hull plating below the &lt;a href=\"waterline\"&gt;waterline&lt;/a&gt;, 75\u00a0percent of her inner bottom, and 50\u00a0percent of her lower decks and &lt;a href=\"bulkhead%20%28partition%29\"&gt;bulkheads&lt;/a&gt; below the armor deck. Work on assembling her propulsion system had begun in the workshop alongside the &lt;a href=\"slipway\"&gt;slipway&lt;/a&gt;, as had the manufacturing of her armor plate. Further work on the hull proceeded more slowly in 1916, and her launching date was repeatedly delayed until she finally was ready to exit the slipway on 20 June 1917, a year behind schedule. By that time, there was no intention to complete the ship, and her launching was primarily intended to clear the slipway for other projects.\nAfter Germany resumed and greatly expanded the &lt;a href=\"unrestricted%20submarine%20warfare\"&gt;unrestricted submarine warfare&lt;/a&gt; campaign in February 1917, Admiral &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20von%20Capelle\"&gt;Eduard von Capelle&lt;/a&gt;, who had by then replaced Tirpitz as the head of the RMA, argued that &lt;a href=\"capital%20ship\"&gt;capital ship&lt;/a&gt; construction should be halted in favor of U-boat construction. The RMA filed a report dated 1February 1918, which stated that capital ship construction had stopped, primarily due to the shifting priorities to the U-boat war. When work stopped on \"W\u00fcrttemberg\" altogether, she was about twelve months from completion. The eight 38\u00a0cm guns that had been manufactured for \"W\u00fcrttemberg\" were instead converted into &lt;a href=\"railway%20gun\"&gt;railway gun&lt;/a&gt;s or fixed batteries in &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt;. The incomplete vessel was still in AG Vulcan's possession at the end of the war in November 1918. According to Article 186 of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt;, signed in June 1919, all German surface warships under construction were to be immediately &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt; for scrap. \"W\u00fcrttemberg\" was accordingly stricken from the &lt;a href=\"naval%20register\"&gt;naval register&lt;/a&gt; on 3 November 1919 and sold to &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaker\"&gt;ship breaker&lt;/a&gt;s in 1921, thereafter being dismantled in Hamburg."
