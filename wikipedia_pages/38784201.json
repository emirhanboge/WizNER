    "text": "Austin Willard Lord &lt;a href=\"FAIA\"&gt;FAIA&lt;/a&gt; (June 27, 1860\u00a0\u2013 January 19, 1922) was an &lt;a href=\"Americans\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"architect\"&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Painting\"&gt;painter&lt;/a&gt;. He was a &lt;a href=\"Partner%20%28business%20rank%29\"&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Architectural%20firm\"&gt;firm&lt;/a&gt; of Lord &amp; Hewlett, best known for their work on the design of the former &lt;a href=\"William%20A.%20Clark%20House\"&gt;William A. Clark House&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Avenue\"&gt;Fifth Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in New York.\nEducation and early career.\nLord was born in &lt;a href=\"Rollingstone%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Rolling Stone, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Orville Morrell Lord (1826\u20131906), one of the first settlers in the area. After receiving his initial training at the &lt;a href=\"Winona%20State%20University\"&gt;Minnesota State Normal School&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Winona%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Winona&lt;/a&gt; and in architects' offices in Minnesota, he entered the &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in 1884. In 1887 he married Margaret Gage (or Gaige) of Winona, and the following year he traveled alone to Europe on a &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Rotch\"&gt;Rotch Traveling Scholarship&lt;/a&gt;. He spent the 1889\u201390 academic year studying in the &lt;a href=\"atelier\"&gt;atelier&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Honor%C3%A9%20Daumet\"&gt;Honor\u00e9 Daumet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Girault\"&gt;Charles Girault&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, after which he visited Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Italy.\nOn his return to the United States in 1890, Lord joined the firm of &lt;a href=\"McKim%2C%20Mead%2C%20and%20White\"&gt;McKim, Mead, and White&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked on such projects as the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Museum%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;Brooklyn Museum of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Club\"&gt;Metropolitan Club&lt;/a&gt;, and buildings at &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20University\"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;. There he met &lt;a href=\"James%20Monroe%20Hewlett\"&gt;James Monroe Hewlett&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he formed a partnership which was to endure until Lord's death in 1922. Among the architects who worked at the firm were &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Hull\"&gt;Washington Hull&lt;/a&gt; (1895\u20131909), &lt;a href=\"Electus%20D.%20Litchfield\"&gt;Electus D. Litchfield&lt;/a&gt; (1901\u201308) and &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Tallant\"&gt;Hugh Tallant&lt;/a&gt; (who had been a partner with &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Beaumont%20Herts\"&gt;Henry Beaumont Herts&lt;/a&gt; since 1897 before joined Lord and Hewlett in 1911). During various times the firm was also known as \"Lord, Hewlett and Hull\" or (more infrequently) \"Lord, Hewlett and Tallant.\"\nAlso in 1894, Lord, under the aegis of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Follen%20McKim\"&gt;Charles F. McKim&lt;/a&gt;, was appointed Director of the American School of Architecture in Rome (later the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20in%20Rome\"&gt;American Academy in Rome&lt;/a&gt;), where he stayed until 1896.\nIn 1899, &lt;a href=\"William%20A.%20Clark\"&gt;William A. Clark&lt;/a&gt;, a wealthy businessman (and later &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;U. S. senator&lt;/a&gt;) from &lt;a href=\"Montana\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, commissioned Lord, Hewlett, &amp; Hull to design a large &lt;a href=\"William%20A.%20Clark%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; for him to be built on &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Avenue%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;Fifth Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. (Clark had commissioned the firm to design his &lt;a href=\"mausoleum\"&gt;mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Woodlawn%20Cemetery%20%28Bronx%29\"&gt;Woodlawn Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bronx\"&gt;Bronx&lt;/a&gt; in 1897.) In 1904 the commission led to a major legal dispute within the firm which was only resolved in 1908, and the house was not completed until 1911.\nLord and Hewlett were also entangled in a legal dispute over the &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20L.%20Whitten%20Building\"&gt;Department of Agriculture Building&lt;/a&gt; to be erected on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Mall\"&gt;National Mall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20DC\"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;. Although the firm won the national design competition for the building (over submissions by such prominent firms as &lt;a href=\"Carr%C3%A8re%20and%20Hastings\"&gt;Carr\u00e8re and Hastings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peabody%20and%20Stearns\"&gt;Peabody and Stearns&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U. S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruled that the appropriation made by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;U. S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; for the project covered only the basic design of the building, and that the firm was never asked to proceed with detailed plans, let alone the actual construction.\nLater career.\nIn 1912, Lord was appointed Trustees Professor of Architecture and Director of the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Architecture%2C%20Planning%20and%20Preservation\"&gt;School of Architecture at Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;. In the same year he was selected by &lt;a href=\"George%20Washington%20Goethals\"&gt;George W. Goethals&lt;/a&gt; to design the administration buildings for the &lt;a href=\"Isthmian%20Canal%20Commission\"&gt;Isthmian Canal Commission&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Panama\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;. \"Lord spent the month of July 1912 on the &lt;a href=\"Isthmus%20of%20Panama\"&gt;Isthmus&lt;/a&gt; studying the &lt;a href=\"topography\"&gt;topography&lt;/a&gt; of the land and local conditions that would affect the design of the buildings. The agreement was that he would return to New York to work out a general scheme in which all of the buildings \"from Toro Point to &lt;a href=\"Taboga%20Island\"&gt;Taboga Island&lt;/a&gt; would be of a prevailing style.\" Due to mutual frustration between Lord and Goethals, Lord resigned from the project in August 1913. Lord's consequent neglect of his work at Columbia led to concern on the part of the trustees of the university and eventually to his dismissal from his position there in 1915.\nShortly after leaving his post at Columbia, Lord retired to &lt;a href=\"Silvermine%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Silvermine, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, where he had bought a large farmhouse and had been active in the artists' colony there, the Silvermine Group of Artists, since its formal establishment in 1909. Although his partnership with Hewlett was to remain until his death, it was about this time that Lord began to devote most of his energies to painting. This was due in part to his friendship with another member of the Silvermine Group, the painter &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Schmitt%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Carl Schmitt&lt;/a&gt;, who married his daughter Gertrude in 1918 and settled permanently in Silvermine the following year. In addition to being part of exhibitions at Silvermine and other local venues, including a one-man show in &lt;a href=\"Winona%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Winona&lt;/a&gt;, Lord's work was shown at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Academy%20of%20Design\"&gt;National Academy of Design&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts\"&gt;Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Newport%20Art%20Museum\"&gt;Art Association of Newport&lt;/a&gt;, and the Mahoning Institute in &lt;a href=\"Youngstown%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Youngstown, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord died in Silvermine in 1922.\nSelected works.\n\"All works attributed to Lord and Hewlett unless otherwise noted.\""
