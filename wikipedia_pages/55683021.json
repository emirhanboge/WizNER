    "text": "The 35th Division () was a &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Republican%20Army\"&gt;Spanish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. \nThis unit was established in March 1937 in order to gather certain scattered units of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Brigades\"&gt;International Brigades&lt;/a&gt; under one command, therefore it was also known as the 35th International Division (\"35.\u00aa Divisi\u00f3n Internacional\"). It took part in some of the major battles of the conflict such as &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Brunete\"&gt;Brunete&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Teruel\"&gt;Teruel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Ebro\"&gt;Battle of the Ebro&lt;/a&gt; persistently being afflicted by numerous casualties, especially in the latter.\nHistory.\nThe 35th Division was established on 23 March 1937 with the &lt;a href=\"XII%20International%20Brigade\"&gt;XII&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"XIV%20International%20Brigade\"&gt;XIV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"International%20Brigades\"&gt;International Brigades&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"69th%20Mixed%20Brigade\"&gt;69th Mixed Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, becoming part of the &lt;a href=\"V%20Army%20Corps%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;5th Army Corps&lt;/a&gt;. The command of the division was entrusted to &lt;a href=\"Karol%20%C5%9Awierczewski\"&gt;Karol \u015awierczewski&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"General Walter\" and the Chief of Staff was Lt. Colonel &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Renn\"&gt;Ludwig Renn&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned &lt;a href=\"German%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;German Communist&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt took part in the &lt;a href=\"Segovia%20Offensive\"&gt;Segovia Offensive&lt;/a&gt; towards the end of May together with the &lt;a href=\"34th%20Division%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;34th Division&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Gal%C3%A1n\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gal\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;. The combats were led by \"General Walter\" but ended up in complete failure, both divisions taking a high number of casualties. One month later the division took part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Brunete\"&gt;Battle of Brunete&lt;/a&gt; where it was unable to fulfill its targets ending up again with many casualties, even though it fought well and was able to conquer a few positions.\nAt the Aragon Front.\nTowards the end of August the 35th Division was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Aragon\"&gt;Aragon&lt;/a&gt; to take part in the &lt;a href=\"Zaragoza%20Offensive\"&gt;Zaragoza Offensive&lt;/a&gt; together with the &lt;a href=\"11th%20Division%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;11th Division&lt;/a&gt;. This would be one of the main battles of the Civil War. Both divisions were part of the \"Agrupaci\u00f3n \u00abD\u00bb\", which was under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Guilloto%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Modesto&lt;/a&gt; and included cavalry and artillery sections, as well as Soviet-made tanks. The international units under \"&lt;a href=\"General%20Walter\"&gt;General Walter&lt;/a&gt;\" soon took &lt;a href=\"Codo%2C%20Aragon\"&gt;Codo&lt;/a&gt; town, where 300 fanatical &lt;a href=\"Carlist\"&gt;Carlist&lt;/a&gt; troops holed up and put up a fierce fight against the two thousand attacking Republican soldiers. When the brigades entered Codo they saw a wall defaced with the words:\" \"Por cada rojo que m\u00e1teis, un a\u00f1o menos de purgatorio\"\" (For every Red you kill, one year less in &lt;a href=\"purgatory\"&gt;purgatory&lt;/a&gt;). Then the division moved on to nearby &lt;a href=\"Belchite\"&gt;Belchite&lt;/a&gt;, a besieged town that doggedly resisted Republican attacks. The British and American troops of the &lt;a href=\"XV%20International%20Brigade\"&gt;XV International Brigade&lt;/a&gt; fought bravely from house to house, taking a high number of casualties among their ranks. The small town held until 7 September, when the Republican offensive lost steam without having been able to conquer the capital of Aragon further north. After three months of continuous combats the 35th Division was quite mangled and, following a brief attack on &lt;a href=\"Fuentes%20de%20Ebro\"&gt;Fuentes de Ebro&lt;/a&gt;, it withdrew to the rearguard where it was given much needed reinforcement and new weapons. At that time the division was made up of the &lt;a href=\"XI%20International%20Brigade\"&gt;XI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"XV%20International%20Brigade\"&gt;XV&lt;/a&gt; International Brigades, as well as the &lt;a href=\"32nd%20Mixed%20Brigade\"&gt;32nd Mixed Brigade&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of December the division went to the &lt;a href=\"Teruel%20Front\"&gt;Teruel Front&lt;/a&gt; in order to try to curb the Francoist counterattack which was threatening the small city which had been conquered by the Republicans at a high cost in human lives. At the beginning the 35th Division was assigned to the Reserve, but on 29 December it was called to check the rebel counterattack led by General &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Aranda%20Mata\"&gt;Antonio Aranda&lt;/a&gt;. Unable to face the powerful enemy thrust the division had to withdraw to &lt;a href=\"La%20Muela%20%28Teruel%29\"&gt;\"La Muela\"&lt;/a&gt; Hill, a position which it defended fiercely during the following few days until it moved down to the &lt;a href=\"Singra\"&gt;Singra&lt;/a&gt; sector. On 19 January General Walter's men put up a good fight during the bloody combats in the outskirts of Teruel, putting a check to the Francoist onslaught. Fighting in conditions of extreme cold, the hapless 35th Division suffered a huge number of fatalities during the Teruel campaign.\nBut all that effort would be in vain for on 7 March the rebel armies, after having reconquered &lt;a href=\"Teruel\"&gt;Teruel&lt;/a&gt;, attacked all along the &lt;a href=\"Aragon%20Front\"&gt;Aragon Front&lt;/a&gt;, breaching it in various places. The British, American and Canadian men of the XV International Brigade were the last to leave &lt;a href=\"Belchite\"&gt;Belchite&lt;/a&gt;, by then a ruined place, which they had conquered at such high cost in human lives and materiel the previous summer. In the middle of the debacle General &lt;a href=\"Vicente%20Rojo\"&gt;Vicente Rojo&lt;/a&gt; summoned the International Brigades to gather at &lt;a href=\"Caspe\"&gt;Caspe&lt;/a&gt; in order to try to contain the relentless enemy advance. The 35th Division did its best to comply with the order, although its units were badly shattered, all having suffered heavy casualties and hardly being fit for combat. On 17 March, despite the international units putting up a brave resistance, Caspe fell to the enemy and the Republicans initiated a massive withdrawal towards &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalonia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Levante%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Levant&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of the Ebro.\nAt the beginning of April the 35th Division entered &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalonia&lt;/a&gt; where it would be cut off from the remaining Republican territory to the southwest when the rebels reached the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; shore at &lt;a href=\"Vinar%C3%B2s\"&gt;Vinar\u00f2s&lt;/a&gt; (north of &lt;a href=\"Castell%C3%B3n%20Province\"&gt;Castell\u00f3n Province&lt;/a&gt;). By mid May the division had been largely reorganized and a Spanish commander, &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Mateo%20Merino\"&gt;Pedro Mateo Merino&lt;/a&gt;, was chosen to lead it. Also a new &lt;a href=\"Commissar\"&gt;Commissar&lt;/a&gt; and a new Chief of Staff were named.\nThe division became part of the &lt;a href=\"XV%20Army%20Corps%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;15th Army Corps&lt;/a&gt; led by Colonel &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Tag%C3%BCe%C3%B1a\"&gt;Manuel Tag\u00fce\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; and its brigades were reorganized, including a number of new Spanish recruits and officers in the &lt;a href=\"XI%20International%20Brigade\"&gt;XII&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"XIII%20International%20Brigade\"&gt;XIV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"XV%20International%20Brigade\"&gt;XV&lt;/a&gt; International Brigades. On the night of the 24 to 25 July the division crossed the &lt;a href=\"Ebro%20River\"&gt;Ebro River&lt;/a&gt;, signalling the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Ebro\"&gt;Battle of the Ebro&lt;/a&gt;, one of the major Republican offensives of the war. The first unit of the division that reached the left bank of the river was the &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Beimler%20Battalion\"&gt;Hans Beimler Battalion&lt;/a&gt; of the XI International Brigade. The division crossed at &lt;a href=\"Asc%C3%B3\"&gt;Asc\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;, north of &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B3ra%20d%27Ebre\"&gt;M\u00f3ra d'Ebre&lt;/a&gt;, evicting two Francoist battalions from their fortified positions, occupying &lt;a href=\"La%20Fatarella\"&gt;La Fatarella&lt;/a&gt; and forcing the &lt;a href=\"50th%20Division%20%28Francoist%20Spain%29\"&gt;50th Division&lt;/a&gt; of the rebel army to withdraw. It reached the &lt;a href=\"Camposines\"&gt;Venta de Camposines&lt;/a&gt;, taking &lt;a href=\"Corbera%20d%27Ebre\"&gt;Corbera d'Ebre&lt;/a&gt; and the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Gandesa\"&gt;Gandesa&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the Republican division that made the most spectacular advance in territory previously controlled by the rebels in the whole battle. On 6 August the &lt;a href=\"27th%20Division%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;27th Division&lt;/a&gt; relieved the 35th Division and took over its positions at &lt;a href=\"Vilalba%20dels%20Arcs\"&gt;Vilalba dels Arcs&lt;/a&gt;, so that it could go to the rearguard for a well-deserved rest after nearly two weeks of uninterrupted combats. Barely a week later it went back to the frontline relieving the much-battered &lt;a href=\"11th%20Division%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;11th Division&lt;/a&gt; on 15 August. \nIn order to satisfy the demands of the &lt;a href=\"Non-Intervention%20Committee\"&gt;Non-Intervention Committee&lt;/a&gt;, the directive to withdraw the foreign members of the division arrived on 22 September. On that day the XV International Brigade took part in its last battle. In a similar manner as in August, the British battalion again suffered heavy losses. The division held its positions around Corbera until the fourth Francoist counteroffensive, when it was forced to move north by the rebel advance and had to cross back the Ebro east of &lt;a href=\"Fay%C3%B3n\"&gt;Fay\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; by mid November, being the last Republican unit to withdraw. By then the international troops of the division had been withdrawn from the front and had been replaced by Spanish conscripts.\nTwilight and end of the division.\nOn 23 December the rebels began their &lt;a href=\"Catalonia%20Offensive\"&gt;Catalonia Offensive&lt;/a&gt; with a series of attacks along the &lt;a href=\"Segre%20River\"&gt;Segre River&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"V%20Army%20Corps%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;V Army Corps&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20L%C3%ADster\"&gt;Enrique L\u00edster&lt;/a&gt; was swiftly sent to the area in order to try to plug the gap at the height of &lt;a href=\"Borges%20Blanques\"&gt;Borges Blanques&lt;/a&gt;. For an anguishing period of twelve days the last remnants of Republican elite troops in Catalonia were able to contain the fierce attacks of the Fascist Italians of the &lt;a href=\"Corpo%20Truppe%20Volontarie\"&gt;Corpo Truppe Volontarie&lt;/a&gt; (CTV), but on 5 January the loyalist resistance crumbled and there was a general debacle. Those left of the 35th Division withdrew alongside the Catalan coast northwards together with the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"XV%20Army%20Corps%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;XV Army Corps&lt;/a&gt;. They passed through &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and moved on with the relentless rebel advance at their heels until they reached the French border in the first days of February. Once in France the division was extinguished as the Republican soldiers were disarmed and interned in &lt;a href=\"concentration%20camps\"&gt;concentration camps&lt;/a&gt; by the French authorities."
