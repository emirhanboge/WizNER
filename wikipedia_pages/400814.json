    "text": "Luzhniki Stadium () is the &lt;a href=\"national%20stadium\"&gt;national stadium&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, located in its capital city, &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. The full name of the stadium is Grand Sports Arena of the Luzhniki Olympic Complex. Its total &lt;a href=\"seating%20capacity\"&gt;seating capacity&lt;/a&gt; of 81,000 makes it the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20football%20stadiums%20in%20Russia\"&gt;largest football stadium in Russia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20European%20stadiums%20by%20capacity\"&gt;ninth-largest stadium in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium is a part of the &lt;a href=\"Luzhniki%20Olympic%20Complex\"&gt;Luzhniki Olympic Complex&lt;/a&gt;, and is located in &lt;a href=\"Khamovniki%20District\"&gt;Khamovniki District&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Administrative%20Okrug\"&gt;Central Administrative Okrug&lt;/a&gt; of Moscow city. The name \"Luzhniki\" derives from the flood meadows in the bend of &lt;a href=\"Moskva%20River\"&gt;Moskva River&lt;/a&gt; where the stadium was built, translating roughly as \"The Meadows\". The stadium is located at Luzhniki Street, 24, Moscow.\nLuzhniki was the main stadium of the &lt;a href=\"1980%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1980 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as some of the competitions, including the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201980%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; of the football tournament. A &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20stadium%20categories\"&gt;UEFA Category 4&lt;/a&gt; stadium, Luzhniki hosted the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20UEFA%20Cup%20and%20Europa%20League%20finals\"&gt;UEFA Cup final&lt;/a&gt; in 1999 and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20finals\"&gt;UEFA Champions League final&lt;/a&gt; in 2008. The stadium also hosted such events as &lt;a href=\"1973%20Summer%20Universiade\"&gt;Summer Universiade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1986%20Goodwill%20Games\"&gt;Goodwill Games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2013%20World%20Championships%20in%20Athletics\"&gt;World Athletics Championships&lt;/a&gt;. It was the main stadium of the &lt;a href=\"2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2018 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and hosted 7 matches of the tournament, including the opening match and the &lt;a href=\"2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the past, its field has been used as the home ground (at various times) for &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; games played by &lt;a href=\"PFC%20CSKA%20Moscow\"&gt;CSKA Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Spartak%20Moscow\"&gt;Spartak Moscow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Torpedo%20Moscow\"&gt;Torpedo Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are currently no clubs based at the stadium. Today, it is mainly used as one of the home stadiums of the &lt;a href=\"Russia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Russia national football team&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium is used from time to time for various other sporting events and for concerts. It is also used to host the finals of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Cup%20%28football%29\"&gt;Russian domestic cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nThe stadium is located in &lt;a href=\"Khamovniki%20District\"&gt;Khamovniki District&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Administrative%20Okrug\"&gt;Central Administrative Okrug&lt;/a&gt; of Moscow city, south-west of the city center. The name \"Luzhniki\" derives from the flood meadows in the bend of &lt;a href=\"Moskva%20River\"&gt;Moskva River&lt;/a&gt; where the stadium was built, translating roughly as \"The Meadows\". It was necessary to find a very large plot of land, preferably in a green area close to the city center that could fit into the transport map of the capital without too much difficulty.\nAccording to one of the architects: \"On a sunny spring day of 1954, we, a group of architects and engineers who were tasked with designing the Central stadium, climbed onto a large paved area on the Lenin Hills... the proximity of the river, green mass of clean, fresh air \u2013 this circumstance alone mattered to select the area of the future city of sports... In addition, Luzhniki is located relatively close to the city center and convenient access to major transport systems with all parts of the capital\".\nPlaying surface.\nIt was one of the few major European football stadia to use an artificial pitch, having installed a FIFA-approved &lt;a href=\"FieldTurf\"&gt;FieldTurf&lt;/a&gt; pitch in 2002. However, a temporary natural grass pitch was installed for the &lt;a href=\"2008%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;2008 UEFA Champions League Final&lt;/a&gt;. The game between &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; was the first &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20finals\"&gt;UEFA Champions League final&lt;/a&gt; held in Russia. On the match day, &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; gave Luzhniki its elite status.\nIn August 2016 a permanent hybrid turf was installed, consisting of 95 percent natural grass reinforced with plastic.\nHistory.\nBackground and early years.\nOn 23 December 1954, the Government of the USSR adopted a resolution on the construction of a stadium in the Luzhniki area in Moscow. The decision of the Soviet Government was a response to a specific current international situation: By the early 1950s, Soviet athletes took to the world stage for the first time after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; (rus. the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Patriotic%20War\"&gt;Great Patriotic War&lt;/a&gt;), participating in the Olympic Games. The &lt;a href=\"1952%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1952 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Helsinki brought the Soviet team 71 medals (of which 22 gold) and second place in the unofficial team standings.\nIt was a major success, but the increased athletic development of the Soviet Union, which was a matter of &lt;a href=\"Sports%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;state policy&lt;/a&gt;, required the construction of a new sports complex. The proposed complex was to meet all modern international standards and at the same time serve as a training base for the Olympic team and arena for large domestic and international competitions.\nThe stadium was built in 1955\u201356 as the Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium. The design began in January 1955 and was completed in 90 days by the architects Alexander Vlasov, Igor Rozhin, Nikolai Ullas, Alexander Khryakov and engineers Vsevolod Nasonov, Nikolai Reznikov, Vasily Polikarpov. Building materials came from &lt;a href=\"Leningrad\"&gt;Leningrad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20SSR\"&gt;Armenian SSR&lt;/a&gt;, electrical and oak beams for the spectator benches from the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20SSR\"&gt;Ukrainian SSR&lt;/a&gt;, furniture from &lt;a href=\"Riga\"&gt;Riga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kaunas\"&gt;Kaunas&lt;/a&gt;, glass was brought from &lt;a href=\"Minsk\"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt;, electrical equipment from &lt;a href=\"Podolsk\"&gt;Podolsk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Oblast\"&gt;Moscow Oblast&lt;/a&gt;, and larch lumber from Irkutsk in Siberia. It was necessary to demolish a whole area of dilapidated buildings (including the Trinity Church, which is supposed to be restored). Because the soil was heavily waterlogged, almost the entire area of the foundations of the complex had to be raised half a meter. 10,000 piles were hammered into the ground and dredgers reclaimed about 3\u00a0million cubic metres of &lt;a href=\"soil\"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt;. The total area of the stadium occupies 160 hectares. Eight thousand people moved home to make place for the stadium. The Church &lt;a href=\"Tikhvin\"&gt;Tikhvin&lt;/a&gt;, an architectural monument of the 18th century was moved, too.\nThe stadium was officially opened on 31 July 1956, with a friendly football match between the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;RSFSR&lt;/a&gt; and China. 100 thousand spectators welcomed the event. The stadium was built in just 450 days. It was the &lt;a href=\"national%20stadium\"&gt;national stadium&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, and is now the national stadium of Russia. In 1960 a 26-foot bronze statue of &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Lenin\"&gt;Lenin&lt;/a&gt; by sculptor &lt;a href=\"Matvey%20Manizer\"&gt;Matvei Manizer&lt;/a&gt;, which was created for &lt;a href=\"Expo%2058\"&gt;Expo 58&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussel&lt;/a&gt;, was placed on the square in front of the main stadium entrance.\n1980 Summer Olympics.\nIn 1976\u20131979 the &lt;a href=\"sports%20complex\"&gt;sports complex&lt;/a&gt; was repaired for the first time. The stadium was the chief venue for the &lt;a href=\"1980%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1980 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, the spectator capacity being 103,000 at that time. The events hosted in this stadium were the &lt;a href=\"1980%20Summer%20Olympics%20opening%20ceremony\"&gt;opening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1980%20Summer%20Olympics%20closing%20ceremony\"&gt;closing&lt;/a&gt; ceremonies, &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20at%20the%201980%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201980%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; finals, and the &lt;a href=\"Equestrian%20at%20the%201980%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;individual jumping grand prix&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen General Secretary of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;CPSU Central Committee&lt;/a&gt; and Chairman of the Presidium of the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;USSR Supreme Soviet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Brezhnev\"&gt;Leonid Brezhnev&lt;/a&gt; declared the &lt;a href=\"1980%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;XXII Summer Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; open.\n1982 Luzhniki disaster.\nOn 20 October 1982, &lt;a href=\"Luzhniki%20disaster\"&gt;disaster struck&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"1982%E2%80%9383%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; match between FC Spartak Moscow and &lt;a href=\"HFC%20Haarlem\"&gt;HFC Haarlem&lt;/a&gt;. 66 people died in the &lt;a href=\"stampede\"&gt;stampede&lt;/a&gt;, which made it Russia's worst sporting disaster and most famous cover-up at the time.\n1990s and 2000s.\nIn the spring of 1992, the state enterprise, including the sports complex, was privatized and renamed the Luzhniki Olympic Complex, and by June of the same year, Lenin's name was removed. An extensive renovation in 1996 saw the construction of a roof over the stands, and the refurbishment of the seating areas, resulting in a decrease in capacity. Till the renovation, the stadium could accommodate 81 thousand people.\nIn 1998, the stadium was listed by UEFA in the list of &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20stadium%20categories\"&gt;5-star European football stadiums&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stadium hosted the &lt;a href=\"1999%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1999 UEFA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href=\"Parma%20F.C.\"&gt;Parma&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20de%20Marseille\"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt; in the second &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20UEFA%20Cup%20and%20Europa%20League%20finals\"&gt;UEFA Cup final&lt;/a&gt; to be played as a single fixture.\nThe Luzhniki Stadium was chosen by the UEFA to host the &lt;a href=\"2008%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;2008 UEFA Champions League Final&lt;/a&gt; won by &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; who beat &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; in the first all-English &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20finals\"&gt;Champions League final&lt;/a&gt; on 21 May. The match passed incident-free and a spokesman for the British Embassy in Moscow said, \"The security and logistical arrangements put in place by the Russian authorities have been first-rate, as has been their cooperation with their visiting counterparts from the UK.\"\nIn August 2013, the stadium hosted the &lt;a href=\"2013%20World%20Championships%20in%20Athletics\"&gt;World Athletics Championships&lt;/a&gt;.\nRenovation for FIFA World Cup.\nThe original stadium was demolished in 2013 to give a way for the construction of a new stadium. However, the self-supported cover was retained. The facade wall was retained as well, due to its architectural value, and was later reconnected to the new building. Construction of the new stadium was completed in 2017. The total cost of repairs was 24\u00a0billion &lt;a href=\"Russian%20ruble\"&gt;rubles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2018 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; was held in Russia with the Luzhniki Stadium selected as the venue for the opening match and also the &lt;a href=\"2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;, which was held on 15 July 2018. For the 2018 World Cup the stadium organized six checkpoints with 39 inspection lanes and seven pedestrian points with 427 points for the passage of spectators. About 900 scanners, 3000 cameras and monitors were installed. Special seats were provided for fans with disabilities. The stadium's capacity was increased from 78,000 to 81,000 seats, partly caused by the removal of the athletics track around the pitch. In 2018 FIFA named the stadium as best arena in the world.\nThe stadium joins Rome's &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Olimpico\"&gt;Stadio Olimpico&lt;/a&gt;, London's &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;old Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, Berlin's &lt;a href=\"Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29\"&gt;Olympiastadion&lt;/a&gt; and Munich's &lt;a href=\"Olympiastadion%20%28Munich%29\"&gt;Olympiastadion&lt;/a&gt; as the only stadiums to have hosted the finals of the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and UEFA's &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup/Champions League&lt;/a&gt; and featured as a main stadium of the &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Summer Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;. Saint Denis' &lt;a href=\"Stade%20de%20France\"&gt;Stade de France&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to become another in 2024.\nNotable events.\nWhen the Luzhniki Stadium hosted the final game of the 1957 &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Hockey%20World%20Championship\"&gt;Ice Hockey World Championship&lt;/a&gt; between Sweden and the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, it was attended by a crowd of 55,000 and set a new world record at the time. On 23 May 1963, &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Castro\"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; made a historic speech in Luzhniki Stadium during his record 38-day visit to the Soviet Union.\n&lt;a href=\"New%20Japan%20Pro-Wrestling\"&gt;New Japan Pro-Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, the Japanese &lt;a href=\"professional%20wrestling\"&gt;professional wrestling&lt;/a&gt; promotion, ran a show in 1989. Luzhniki Stadium also makes an appearance in the Russian supernatural thriller film \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch%20%282004%20film%29\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;\" (), during the power shut-down scene when the power station goes into overload. The stadium is seen with a match taking place, and then the lights go out.\nIn 2008, &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw to win their third &lt;a href=\"European%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt;.
