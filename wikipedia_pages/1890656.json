    "text": "General elections were held in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; on 21 September 1963. The elections saw the Malaysian ruling party, &lt;a href=\"United%20Malays%20National%20Organisation\"&gt;United Malays National Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (UMNO), backed with &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Alliance%20Party\"&gt;Singapore Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt; (SAP) in an attempt to oust the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Action%20Party\"&gt;People's Action Party&lt;/a&gt; (PAP), after violating previous agreement not to do so and a highlight in the &lt;a href=\"PAP-UMNO%20relations\"&gt;relations between UMNO and the PAP&lt;/a&gt;. However, the result was a victory for the PAP, which won 37 of the 51 seats in the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;Singapore Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. The 1963 election was the only election to date with no &lt;a href=\"redistricting\"&gt;boundary changes&lt;/a&gt; to any of the 51 existing constituencies.\nAs Singapore gained &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Singapore%23Independence%20from%20Malaysia\"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt; in 1965, this election was the only election that was held as &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20in%20Malaysia\"&gt;a state of Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. After independence, the elected members of the Legislative Assembly would then become Members of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Parliament%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;inaugural Parliament of Singapore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Action%20Party\"&gt;People's Action Party&lt;/a&gt; (PAP) had won 43 seats in the &lt;a href=\"1959%20Singaporean%20general%20election\"&gt;1959 elections&lt;/a&gt;, they lost four seats in 1961 (two were from the &lt;a href=\"1961%20Singaporean%20by-elections\"&gt;by-election defeats&lt;/a&gt;, and two defected to the new &lt;a href=\"United%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Singapore%29\"&gt;United People's Party&lt;/a&gt; (UPP)). A further 13 legislators were expelled from PAP for voting against the government in a no-confidence motion on 20 July 1961; the dissidents subsequently formed a new party, the &lt;a href=\"Barisan%20Sosialis\"&gt;Barisan Sosialis&lt;/a&gt; (BS), alleging PAP as a communist front. The combination of by-election defeats, defections and expulsions reduced the PAP by 17 seats down to 26, leaving PAP with a one-seat majority.\nOn 3 July 1962, while the &lt;a href=\"1962%20Singaporean%20integration%20referendum\"&gt;integration referendum&lt;/a&gt; debate was in procession, PAP lost its majority following the resignation of legislator &lt;a href=\"Ho%20Puay%20Choo\"&gt;Ho Puay Choo&lt;/a&gt; (who later joined BS on 11 August). Five days later, UPP legislator &lt;a href=\"S.%20V.%20Lingam\"&gt;S. V. Lingam&lt;/a&gt; returned to PAP fold, giving it back its one-seat majority, but five days later, PAP lost its majority again after health minister &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Ibrahim%20%28Singaporean%20politician%29\"&gt;Ahmad Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt; died from liver cancer. BS initially planned to field its iconic leader, &lt;a href=\"Lim%20Chin%20Siong\"&gt;Lim Chin Siong&lt;/a&gt;, in the vacated seat, but the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew opted against a by-election, and instead called a fresh election.\nOn 31 August 1963, Singapore was declared independent from the United Kingdom with PAP declared as trustees until the merger with Malaysia could be complete. On 3 September, Lee dissolved the Legislative Assembly in accordance with procedure, and called for elections to be held on 21 September.\nCampaign.\nThe elections, held in the midst of Singapore's merger with Malaysia, are remembered as the PAP's most hard-fought election, as the party fielded a full slate and faced intensive challenges from three components that did nearly the same. BS collated with &lt;a href=\"Parti%20Rakyat%20Malaysia\"&gt;Parti Rakyat&lt;/a&gt;, and fielded candidates in all but two seats, while UPP had an unusual large number of candidates. The PAP government launched &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Coldstore\"&gt;Operation Coldstore&lt;/a&gt; on 2 February 1963 and detained several BS leaders, including Lim.\nOn the final night of campaigning, PAP officials warned that should BS win the election and defeat PAP, the Malaysia Federal government could send troops into Singapore to invoke emergency powers in place of the incoming government led by the new pro-communist party, leaving no opportunity for BS to respond. This was said to have accounted for the eventual victory of the PAP the following day.\nThe sole &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (WP) legislator &lt;a href=\"David%20Marshall%20%28Singaporean%20politician%29\"&gt;David Marshall&lt;/a&gt; resigned from the party he founded and became the only independent. Another participant was &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Alliance\"&gt;Singapore Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, an extension of the ruling federal &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Party%20%28Malaya%29\"&gt;Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt; in Malaysia, which was a coalition consisting of the &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20People%27s%20Alliance\"&gt;Singapore People's Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (SPA) along with the local branches of UMNO, the &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20Chinese%20Association\"&gt;Malayan Chinese Association&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20Indian%20Congress\"&gt;Malayan Indian Congress&lt;/a&gt;. However, former Chief Minister and leader &lt;a href=\"Lim%20Yew%20Hock\"&gt;Lim Yew Hock&lt;/a&gt; opted not to run in the elections, citing a defamation campaign by the PAP.\nResults.\nThe PAP won a landslide victory, securing a two-thirds majority, an outcome that had been in doubt or unexpected in the lead-up to the vote. However, the party's vote share was its lowest-ever at just under 47%. Despite the BS and UPP winning a combined 14 seats, both parties failed to win most of the seats they contested, due to the &lt;a href=\"vote%20splitting\"&gt;split&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-PAP vote. A total of 92 candidates lost their deposits.\nThe Singapore Alliance lost all seven seats it had held before dissolution, losing even in core support areas such as Malay constituencies &lt;a href=\"Kampong%20Kembangan%20Single%20Member%20Constituency\"&gt;Kampong Kembangan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Geylang%20Serai%20Single%20Member%20Constituency\"&gt;Geylang Serai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Islands%20Single%20Member%20Constituency\"&gt;Southern Islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nNine incumbent members lost their re-election on the election, among which the defeats of &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Michael%20Byrne\"&gt;Kenneth Michael Byrne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tan%20Kia%20Gan\"&gt;Tan Kia Gan&lt;/a&gt; (in the seats of &lt;a href=\"Crawford%20Single%20Member%20Constituency\"&gt;Crawford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paya%20Lebar%20Single%20Member%20Constituency\"&gt;Paya Lebar&lt;/a&gt;, respectively) marked the first time a higher-ranked PAP cabinet minister had been defeated in their constituencies. This would not happen again until the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Singaporean%20general%20election\"&gt;2011 elections&lt;/a&gt;, 48 years and 11 elections later, where cabinet ministers &lt;a href=\"Lim%20Hwee%20Hua\"&gt;Lim Hwee Hua&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20Yeo\"&gt;George Yeo&lt;/a&gt; were defeated in his constituency of &lt;a href=\"Aljunied%20Group%20Representation%20Constituency\"&gt;Aljunied&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nMany cited factors that led to the PAP victory include: \nTo discourage future defections, the PAP government passed a constitutional amendment stipulating that legislators who resign or are expelled from the parties they were elected under would lose their seats. As a result, by-elections were subsequently held in &lt;a href=\"1965%20Hong%20Lim%20by-election\"&gt;Hong Lim&lt;/a&gt; in 1965, &lt;a href=\"1966%20Singaporean%20by-elections\"&gt;seven constituencies&lt;/a&gt; in 1966 and &lt;a href=\"1967%20Singaporean%20by-elections\"&gt;five constituencies&lt;/a&gt; in 1967. Those victories resulted PAP in achieving a parliament &lt;a href=\"monopoly\"&gt;monopoly&lt;/a&gt; that would last for the next 15 years until the first elected opposition MP in &lt;a href=\"1981%20Anson%20by-election\"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe distribution of 15 Singapore seats in Malaysia's lower house of Parliament (&lt;a href=\"Dewan%20Rakyat\"&gt;Dewan Rakyat&lt;/a&gt;) was based on the outcome of the election. PAP was allocated 12, which were given to Prime Minister Lee, Deputy Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Toh%20Chin%20Chye\"&gt;Toh Chin Chye&lt;/a&gt;, ministers &lt;a href=\"Goh%20Keng%20Swee\"&gt;Goh Keng Swee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ong%20Pang%20Boon\"&gt;Ong Pang Boon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S.%20Rajaratnam\"&gt;S. Rajaratnam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yong%20Nyuk%20Lin\"&gt;Yong Nyuk Lin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jek%20Yeun%20Thong\"&gt;Jek Yeun Thong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lim%20Kim%20San\"&gt;Lim Kim San&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Othman%20Wok\"&gt;Othman Wok&lt;/a&gt; and assembly members &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Rahim%20Ishak\"&gt;Abdul Rahim Ishak&lt;/a&gt;, Wee Toon Boon and Ho See Beng. BS was allocated 3: &lt;a href=\"Chia%20Thye%20Poh\"&gt;Chia Thye Poh&lt;/a&gt;, Lim Huan Boon and Kow Kee Seng."
