    "text": "Rowing, sometimes called crew &lt;a href=\"American%20English\"&gt;in the United States&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"sport\"&gt;sport&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"racing\"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt; boats using &lt;a href=\"Oar%20%28sport%20rowing%29\"&gt;oars&lt;/a&gt;. It differs from &lt;a href=\"paddling\"&gt;paddling&lt;/a&gt; sports in that rowing oars are attached to the boat using &lt;a href=\"oarlock\"&gt;oarlock&lt;/a&gt;s, while paddles are not connected to the boat. Rowing is divided into two disciplines: &lt;a href=\"sculling\"&gt;sculling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sweep%20rowing\"&gt;sweep rowing&lt;/a&gt;. In sculling, each rower holds two oars\u2014one in each hand, while in sweep rowing each rower holds one oar with both hands. There are several boat classes in which athletes may compete, ranging from &lt;a href=\"single%20scull\"&gt;single scull&lt;/a&gt;s, occupied by one person, to shells with eight rowers and a &lt;a href=\"coxswain%20%28rowing%29\"&gt;coxswain&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"eight%20%28rowing%29\"&gt;eight&lt;/a&gt;s. There are a wide variety of course types and formats of racing, but most elite and championship level racing is conducted on calm water courses long with several lanes marked using buoys.\nModern rowing as a competitive sport can be traced to the early 17th century when professional &lt;a href=\"watermen\"&gt;watermen&lt;/a&gt; held races (&lt;a href=\"regatta\"&gt;regatta&lt;/a&gt;s) on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, England. Often prizes were offered by the London Guilds and &lt;a href=\"Livery%20Companies\"&gt;Livery Companies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Amateurism%20in%20sport\"&gt;Amateur&lt;/a&gt; competition began towards the end of the 18th century with the arrival of \"boat clubs\" at British &lt;a href=\"Public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;public schools&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, clubs were formed at colleges within &lt;a href=\"Colleges%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colleges%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; in the early nineteenth century. Public rowing clubs were beginning at the same time in England, Germany, the United States. In 1843, the first American college rowing club was formed at &lt;a href=\"Yale%20College\"&gt;Yale College&lt;/a&gt;.\nRowing is one of the oldest &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic sports&lt;/a&gt;. Though it was on the programme for the 1896 games, racing did not take place due to bad weather. Male rowers have competed since the &lt;a href=\"1900%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1900 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. Women's rowing was added to the Olympic programme in &lt;a href=\"1976%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1976&lt;/a&gt;. Today, there are fourteen boat classes which race at the Olympics. \nIn addition, the sport's governing body, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Rowing%20Federation\"&gt;World Rowing Federation&lt;/a&gt;, holds the annual &lt;a href=\"World%20Rowing%20Championships\"&gt;World Rowing Championships&lt;/a&gt; with twenty-two boat classes.\nAcross six continents, 150 countries now have rowing federations that participate in the sport. Major domestic competitions take place in dominant rowing nations and include &lt;a href=\"The%20Boat%20Race\"&gt;The Boat Race&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henley%20Royal%20Regatta\"&gt;Henley Royal Regatta&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Rowing%20Championships\"&gt;Australian Rowing Championships&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, the &lt;a href=\"Harvard%E2%80%93Yale%20Regatta\"&gt;Harvard\u2013Yale Regatta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20the%20Charles%20Regatta\"&gt;Head of the Charles Regatta&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Henley%20Regatta\"&gt;Royal Canadian Henley Regatta&lt;/a&gt; in Canada. Many other competitions often exist for racing between clubs, schools, and universities in each nation.\nHistory.\nAn Egyptian funerary inscription of 1430 BC records that the warrior &lt;a href=\"Amenhotep%20II\"&gt;Amenhotep&lt;/a&gt; (Amenophis) II was also renowned for his feats of oarsmanship, though there is some disagreement among scholars over whether there were rowing contests in ancient Egypt. In the &lt;a href=\"Aeneid\"&gt;Aeneid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virgil\"&gt;Virgil&lt;/a&gt; mentions rowing forming part of the funeral games arranged by &lt;a href=\"Aeneas\"&gt;Aeneas&lt;/a&gt; in honour of his father. In the 13th century, &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venetian&lt;/a&gt; festivals called \"regata\" included boat races among others.\nThe first known \"modern\" rowing races began from competition among the professional &lt;a href=\"watermen\"&gt;watermen&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; that provided ferry and taxi service on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. Prizes for wager races were often offered by the London &lt;a href=\"Guilds\"&gt;Guilds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Livery%20Companies\"&gt;Livery Companies&lt;/a&gt; or wealthy owners of riverside houses.\nThe oldest surviving such race, &lt;a href=\"Doggett%27s%20Coat%20and%20Badge\"&gt;Doggett's Coat and Badge&lt;/a&gt; was first contested in 1715 and is still held annually from &lt;a href=\"London%20Bridge\"&gt;London Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%2C%20London\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;. During the 19th century these races were to become numerous and popular, attracting large crowds. Prize matches amongst professionals similarly became popular on other rivers throughout Great Britain in the 19th century, notably on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Tyne\"&gt;Tyne&lt;/a&gt;. In America, the earliest known race dates back to 1756 in New York, when a pettiauger defeated a Cape Cod whaleboat in a race.\nAmateur competition in England began towards the end of the 18th century. Documentary evidence from this period is sparse, but it is known that the Monarch Boat Club of &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton College&lt;/a&gt; and the Isis Club of &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20School\"&gt;Westminster School&lt;/a&gt; were both in existence in the 1790s. The Star Club and Arrow Club in London for gentlemen amateurs were also in existence before 1800. At the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt; bumping races were first organised in 1815 when &lt;a href=\"Brasenose%20College%20Boat%20Club\"&gt;Brasenose College&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20College%20Boat%20Club%20%28Oxford%29\"&gt;Jesus College&lt;/a&gt; boat clubs had the first annual race while at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; the first recorded races were in 1827. Brasenose beat Jesus to win Oxford University's first Head of the River; the two clubs claim to be the oldest established boat clubs in the world. &lt;a href=\"The%20Boat%20Race\"&gt;The Boat Race&lt;/a&gt; between Oxford University and Cambridge University first took place in 1829, and was the second intercollegiate sporting event (following the first Varsity Cricket Match by 2 years). The interest in the first Boat Race and subsequent matches led the town of &lt;a href=\"Henley-on-Thames\"&gt;Henley-on-Thames&lt;/a&gt; to begin hosting an &lt;a href=\"Henley%20Royal%20Regatta\"&gt;annual regatta&lt;/a&gt; in 1839.\nFounded in 1818, &lt;a href=\"Leander%20Club\"&gt;Leander Club&lt;/a&gt; is the world's oldest public rowing club. The second oldest club which still exists is the &lt;a href=\"Der%20Hamburger%20und%20Germania%20Ruder%20Club\"&gt;Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club&lt;/a&gt; which was founded 1836 and marked the beginning of rowing as an organized sport in Germany. During the 19th century, as in England, wager matches in North America between professionals became very popular attracting vast crowds. Narragansett Boat Club was founded in 1838 exclusively for rowing. During an 1837 parade in Providence, R.I, a group of boatmen were pulling a longboat on wheels, which carried the oldest living survivor of the 1772 Gaspee Raid. They boasted to the crowd that they were the fastest rowing crew on the Bay. A group of Providence locals took issue with this and challenged them to race, which the Providence group summarily won. The six-man core of that group went on in 1838 to found NBC. Detroit Boat Club was founded in 1839 and is the second oldest continuously-operated rowing club in the U.S. In 1843, the first American college rowing club was formed at &lt;a href=\"Yale%20University\"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Harvard%E2%80%93Yale%20Regatta\"&gt;Harvard\u2013Yale Regatta&lt;/a&gt; is the oldest intercollegiate sporting event in the United States, having been contested every year since 1852 (excepting interruptions for wars and the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Schuylkill%20Navy\"&gt;Schuylkill Navy&lt;/a&gt; is an association of amateur rowing clubs of &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 1858, it is the oldest amateur athletic governing body in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The member clubs are all on the &lt;a href=\"Schuylkill%20River\"&gt;Schuylkill River&lt;/a&gt; where it flows through &lt;a href=\"Fairmount%20Park\"&gt;Fairmount Park&lt;/a&gt; in Philadelphia, mostly on the historic &lt;a href=\"Boathouse%20Row\"&gt;Boathouse Row&lt;/a&gt;. The success of the Schuylkill Navy and similar organizations contributed heavily to the extinction of professional rowing and the sport's current status as an amateur sport. At its founding, it had nine clubs; today, there are 12. At least 23 other clubs have belonged to the Navy at various times. Many of the clubs have a rich history, and have produced a large number of Olympians and world-class competitors.\nThe sport's governing body, &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20des%20Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9s%20d%27Aviron\"&gt;F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d'Aviron&lt;/a&gt;, was founded in 1892, and is the oldest international sports federation in the Olympic movement.\nFISA first organized a &lt;a href=\"European%20Rowing%20Championships\"&gt;European Rowing Championships&lt;/a&gt; in 1893. An annual &lt;a href=\"World%20Rowing%20Championships\"&gt;World Rowing Championships&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in 1962. Rowing has also been conducted at the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=\"1900%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1900&lt;/a&gt; (cancelled at the first modern Games in &lt;a href=\"1896%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1896&lt;/a&gt; due to bad weather).\nHistory of women's rowing.\nWomen row in all boat classes, from single scull to coxed eights, across the same age ranges and standards as men, from junior amateur through university-level to elite athlete. Typically men and women compete in separate crews although mixed crews and mixed team events also take place. Coaching for women is similar to that for men. The world's first women's rowing team was formed in 1896 at the &lt;a href=\"Furnivall%20Sculling%20Club\"&gt;Furnivall Sculling Club&lt;/a&gt; in London. The club, with signature colors a very distinct myrtle and gold, began as a women's club, but eventually allowed the admittance of men in 1901.\nThe first international women's races were the 1954 &lt;a href=\"European%20Rowing%20Championships\"&gt;European Rowing Championships&lt;/a&gt;. The introduction of women's &lt;a href=\"rowing%20at%20the%201976%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;rowing at the 1976 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal increased the growth of women's rowing because it created the incentive for national rowing federations to support women's events. &lt;a href=\"Rowing%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Rowing at the 2012 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in London included six events for women compared with eight for men. In the US, rowing is an NCAA sport for women but not for men; though it is one of the country's oldest collegiate sports, the difference is in large part due to the requirements of &lt;a href=\"Title%20IX\"&gt;Title IX&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the international level, women's rowing traditionally has been dominated by Eastern European countries, such as Romania, Russia, and Bulgaria, although other countries such as Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Great Britain and New Zealand often field competitive teams. The United States also has had very competitive crews, and in recent years these crews have become even more competitive given the surge in women's &lt;a href=\"College%20rowing%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;collegiate rowing&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow there is usually the same number of girls and boys in a group.\nTechnique.\nWhile rowing, the athlete sits in the boat facing toward the &lt;a href=\"stern\"&gt;stern&lt;/a&gt; and uses the &lt;a href=\"oars\"&gt;oars&lt;/a&gt;, which are held in place by &lt;a href=\"oarlock\"&gt;oarlock&lt;/a&gt;s, to propel the boat forward (towards the &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;). Rowing is distinguished from &lt;a href=\"paddling\"&gt;paddling&lt;/a&gt; in that the oar is attached to the boat using an &lt;a href=\"oarlock\"&gt;oarlock&lt;/a&gt;, where in paddling there is no oarlock or attachment of the paddle to the boat.\nThe rowing stroke may be characterized by two fundamental reference points: the \"catch\", which is placement of the oar blade in the water, and the \"extraction\", also known as the \"finish\" or \"release\", when the rower removes the oar blade from the water.\nAfter the blade is placed in the water at the catch, the rower applies pressure to the oar levering the boat forward which is called the drive phase of the stroke. Once the rower extracts the oar from the water, the recovery phase begins, setting up the rower's body for the next stroke.\nAt the catch, the rower places the blade in the water and applies pressure to the oar by pushing the seat toward the bow of the boat by extending the legs, thus pushing the boat through the water. The point of placement of the blade in the water is a relatively fixed point about which the oar serves as a lever to propel the boat. As the rower's legs approach full extension, the rower pivots the torso toward the bow of the boat and then finally pulls the arms towards his or her chest. The hands meet the chest right above the diaphragm.\nAt the end of the stroke, with the blade still in the water, the hands drop slightly to unload the oar so that spring energy stored in the bend of the oar gets transferred to the boat which eases removing the oar from the water and minimizes energy wasted on lifting water above the surface (splashing).\nThe recovery phase follows the drive. The recovery starts with the extraction and involves coordinating the body movements with the goal to move the oar back to the catch position. In extraction, the rower pushes down on the oar handle to quickly lift the blade from the water and rapidly rotates the oar so that the blade is parallel to the water. This process is sometimes referred to as \"feathering the blade\". Simultaneously, the rower pushes the oar handle away from the chest. The blade emerges from the water square and feathers immediately once clear of the water. After feathering and extending the arms, the rower pivots the body forward. Once the hands are past the knees, the rower compresses the legs which moves the seat towards the stern of the boat. The leg compression occurs relatively slowly compared to the rest of the stroke, which affords the rower a moment to recover, and allows the boat to glide through the water. The gliding of the boat through the water during recovery is often called \"run\".\nA controlled slide is necessary to maintain momentum and achieve optimal boat run. However, various teaching methods disagree about the optimal relation in timing between drive and recovery. Near the end of the recovery, the rower squares the blade into perpendicular orientation with respect to the water and begins another stroke.\nBoat classes.\nBroadly, there are two ways to row, sometimes called disciplines:\nWithin each discipline, there are several boat classes. A single regatta (series of races) will often feature races for many boat classes. They are classified using:\nAlthough sculling and sweep boats are generally identical to each other (except having different &lt;a href=\"outrigger\"&gt;riggers&lt;/a&gt;), they are referred to using different names:\nSculling boat classes:\nSweep boat classes:\nEquipment.\nRacing shell.\n&lt;a href=\"Racing%20shell\"&gt;Racing boat&lt;/a&gt;s (often called \"shells\") are long, narrow, and broadly semi-circular in cross-section in order to reduce drag in the water. There is some trade off between boat speed and stability in choice of hull shape. They usually have a fin towards the rear, to help prevent roll and yaw and to increase the effectiveness of the rudder.\nOriginally made from &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, shells are now almost always made from a &lt;a href=\"composite%20material\"&gt;composite material&lt;/a&gt; (usually a double skin of &lt;a href=\"carbon-fiber%20reinforced%20plastic\"&gt;carbon-fiber reinforced plastic&lt;/a&gt; with a sandwich of honeycomb material) for strength and weight advantages. World Rowing rules specify minimum weights for each class of boat so that no individual team will gain a great advantage from the use of expensive materials or technology.\nSmaller sculling boats are usually steered by the scullers pulling harder on one side or the other while larger boats often have a &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt;, controlled by the coxswain, if present, or by one of the crew using a cable attached to one of the shoes.\nWith the smaller boats, specialist versions of the shells for sculling can be made lighter. The riggers in sculling apply the forces symmetrically to each side of the boat, whereas in sweep oared racing these forces are staggered alternately along the boat. The sweep oared boat has to be stiffer to handle these unmatched forces, so consequently requires more bracing and is usually heavier \u2013 a pair (2-) is usually a more robust boat than a double scull (2x) for example, and being heavier is also slower when used as a double scull. In theory, this could also apply to the 4x and 8x, but most rowing clubs cannot afford to have a dedicated large hull which might be rarely used and instead generally opt for versatility in their fleet by using stronger shells which can be rigged for either sweep rowing or sculling. The symmetrical forces also make sculling more efficient than rowing: the double scull is faster than the coxless pair, and the quadruple scull is faster than the coxless four.\nMany adjustments can be made to the equipment to accommodate the physiques of the crew. Collectively these adjustments are known as the boat's &lt;a href=\"Boat%20rigging%20%28sport%20rowing%29\"&gt;rigging&lt;/a&gt;.\nOar.\nOars, sometimes referred to as blades, are used to propel the boat. They are long (sculling: 250\u2013300\u00a0cm; sweep oar: 340\u2013360\u00a0cm) poles with one flat end about 50\u00a0cm long and 25\u00a0cm wide, called the blade. Classic blades were made out of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, but modern blades are made from more expensive and durable &lt;a href=\"Synthetic%20fiber\"&gt;synthetic&lt;/a&gt; material, the most common being &lt;a href=\"carbon%20fiber\"&gt;carbon fiber&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn 'oar' is often referred to as a \"blade\" in the case of sweep oar rowing and as a \"scull\" in the case of sculling. A sculling oar is shorter and has a smaller blade area than the equivalent sweep oar. The combined blade area of a pair of sculls is however greater than that of a single sweep oar, so the oarsman when sculling is working against more water than when rowing sweep-oared. He is able to do this because the body action in sculling is more anatomically efficient (due to the symmetry).\nThe \"spoon\" of oars is normally painted with the colours of the club to which they belong. This greatly simplifies identification of boats at a distance. As many sports teams have logos printed on their jerseys, rowing clubs have specifically painted blades that each team is associated with.\nTraining equipment.\nIndoor rowing (on &lt;a href=\"indoor%20rower\"&gt;indoor rower&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"rowing%20tank\"&gt;rowing tank&lt;/a&gt;) is a way to train technique and strength by going through the same motions as rowing, with resistance(usually a large tank of water). Indoor rowing is helpful when there are no rowable bodies of water near by, or weather conditions don't permit rowing.\nA rowing tank is an indoor facility which attempts to mimic the conditions rowers face on open water. Rowing tanks are used primarily for off-season rowing, muscle-specific conditioning and technique training, or simply when bad weather prevents open-water training.\n&lt;a href=\"Indoor%20rower\"&gt;Ergometer&lt;/a&gt; rowing machines (colloquially \"ergs\" or \"ergo\") simulate the rowing action and provide a means of training on land when waterborne training is restricted, and of measuring rowing fitness. Ergometers do not simulate the lateral balance challenges, the exact resistance of water, or the exact motions of true rowing including the sweep of the oar handles. For that reason ergometer scores are generally not used as the sole selection criterion for crews (colloquially \"ergs don't float\"), and technique training is limited to the basic body position and movements. However, this action can still allow a workout comparable to those experienced on the water. Indoor rowing has become popular as a sport in its own right with numerous indoor competitions (and the annual World Championship &lt;a href=\"CRASH-B%20Sprints\"&gt;CRASH-B Sprints&lt;/a&gt; in Boston) during the winter off-season.\nRace formats.\nThere are several formats for rowing races, often called \"&lt;a href=\"regattas\"&gt;regattas&lt;/a&gt;\". The two most common are side by side and &lt;a href=\"head%20race\"&gt;head race&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSide-by-side.\nMost races that are held in the spring and summer feature side-by-side, or sprint racing; all the boats start at the same time from a stationary position, and the winner is the boat that crosses the finish line first. The number of boats in a race typically varies between two (which is sometimes referred to as a \"dual race\") to eight, but any number of boats can start together if the course is wide enough.\nThe standard length races for the Olympics and the &lt;a href=\"World%20Rowing%20Championships\"&gt;World Rowing Championships&lt;/a&gt; is long. In the United States, some scholastic (high school) races are , while many youth races are the standard 2 kilometres. \"Masters\" rowers (rowers older than 27) often race 1,000\u00a0m. However the race distance can and does vary from \"dashes\" or sprints, which may be long, to longer dual races like the &lt;a href=\"The%20Boat%20Race\"&gt;Boat Race&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo traditional non-standard distance shell races are the annual &lt;a href=\"Boat%20Race\"&gt;Boat Race&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Oxford\"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Harvard-Yale%20Boat%20Race\"&gt;Harvard-Yale Boat Race&lt;/a&gt; which cover courses of approximately . The &lt;a href=\"Henley%20Royal%20Regatta\"&gt;Henley Royal Regatta&lt;/a&gt; is also raced upon a non-standard distance at 2,112\u00a0meters (1\u00a0mile, 550\u00a0yards).\nIn general, multi-boat competitions are organized in a series of rounds, with the fastest boats in each heat qualifying for the next round. The losing boats from each heat may be given a second chance to qualify through a &lt;a href=\"repechage\"&gt;repechage&lt;/a&gt;. The World Rowing Championships offers multi-lane racing in heats, finals and repechages. At Henley Royal Regatta two crews compete side by side in each round, in a straightforward &lt;a href=\"Single-elimination%20tournament\"&gt;knock-out format&lt;/a&gt;, with no repechages.\nHead races.\n&lt;a href=\"Head%20race\"&gt;Head race&lt;/a&gt;s are &lt;a href=\"time%20trial\"&gt;time trial&lt;/a&gt; / processional races that take place from autumn (fall) to early spring (depending on local conditions). Boats begin with a rolling start at &lt;a href=\"interval%20%28time%29\"&gt;interval&lt;/a&gt;s of 10 \u2013 20\u00a0seconds, and are timed over a set distance. Head courses usually vary in length from to , though there are longer races such as the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Rowing%20Marathon\"&gt;Boston Rowing Marathon&lt;/a&gt; and shorter such as &lt;a href=\"Pairs%20Head\"&gt;Pairs Head&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe oldest, and arguably most famous, head race is the &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20the%20River%20Race\"&gt;Head of the River Race&lt;/a&gt;, founded by &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Fairbairn\"&gt;Steve Fairbairn&lt;/a&gt; in 1926 which takes place each March on the river &lt;a href=\"Thames\"&gt;Thames&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, United Kingdom. Head racing was exported to the United States in the 1950s, and the &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20the%20Charles\"&gt;Head of the Charles Regatta&lt;/a&gt; held each October on the &lt;a href=\"Charles%20River\"&gt;Charles River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, United States is now the largest rowing event in the world. The Head of the Charles, along with the &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20the%20Schuylkill%20Regatta\"&gt;Head of the Schuylkill&lt;/a&gt; in Philadelphia and the Head of the Connecticut, are considered to be the three \"fall classics.\"\nThese processional races are known as \"Head Races\", because, as with bumps racing, the fastest crew is awarded the title \"Head of the River\" (as in \"head of the class\"). It was not deemed feasible to run bumps racing on the Tideway, so a timed format was adopted and soon caught on.\nTime trials are sometimes used to determine who competes in an event where there is a limited number of entries, for example, the qualifying races for Henley Royal Regatta, and \"rowing on\" and \"getting on\" for the Oxford and Cambridge &lt;a href=\"Bumps%20race\"&gt;Bumps race&lt;/a&gt;s respectively.\nOther race formats.\nA &lt;a href=\"bumps%20race\"&gt;bumps race&lt;/a&gt; is a multi-day race beginning with crews lined up along the river at set intervals. They start simultaneously and all pursue the boat ahead while avoiding being bumped by a boat from behind. If a crew overtakes or makes physical contact with the crew ahead, a \"bump\" is awarded. As a result, damage to boats and equipment is common during bumps racing. To avoid damage the cox of the crew being bumped may concede the bump before contact is actually made. The next day, the bumping crew will start ahead of any crews that have been bumped. The positions at the end of the last race are used to set the positions on the first day of the races the next year. Oxford and Cambridge Universities hold bumps races for their respective colleges twice a year, and there are also \"Town Bumps\" races in both cities, open to non-university crews. Oxford's races are organised by City of Oxford Rowing Club and Cambridge's are organised by the &lt;a href=\"Cambridgeshire%20Rowing%20Association\"&gt;Cambridgeshire Rowing Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stake format was often used in early American races. Competitors line up at the start, race to a stake, moored boat, or buoy some distance away, and return. The 180\u00b0 turn requires mastery of steering. These races are popular with spectators because one may watch both the start and finish. Usually only two boats would race at once to avoid collision. The Green Mountain Head Regatta continues to use the stake format, but it is run as a head race with an interval start. A similar type of racing is found in UK and Irish coastal rowing, where a number of boats race out to a given point from the coast and then return fighting rough water all the way. In Irish coastal rowing the boats are in individual lanes with the races consisting of up to 3 turns to make the race distance 2.3\u00a0km.\nBoat positions.\nRowers in multi-rower boats are numbered sequentially from the bow aft. The number-one rower is called the &lt;a href=\"bow%20%28position%29\"&gt;bowman&lt;/a&gt;, or just 'bow', whilst the rower closest to the stern is called the '&lt;a href=\"strokeman\"&gt;strokeman&lt;/a&gt;' or just 'stroke'. There are some exceptions to this \u2013 some UK coastal rowers, and in France, Spain, and Italy rowers number from stern to bow.\nIn addition to this, certain crew members have other titles and roles. In an 8+ the stern pair are responsible for setting the stroke rate and rhythm for the rest of the boat to follow. The middle four (sometimes called the \"engine room\" or \"power house\") are usually the less technical, but more powerful rowers in the crew, whilst the bow pair are the more technical and generally regarded as the pair to set up the balance of the boat. They also have most influence on the line the boat steers.\nCoxswain.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Coxswain%20%28rowing%29\"&gt;coxswain&lt;/a&gt; (or simply the cox) is the member who steers the boat using rudder strings, and coordinates the power and rhythm of the rowers, by communicating to the crew, often through a device called a &lt;a href=\"cox%20box\"&gt;cox box&lt;/a&gt; and speakers. The cox usually sits in the stern of the boat facing the rowers but in &lt;a href=\"bowloader\"&gt;bowloader&lt;/a&gt;s, usually seen in the &lt;a href=\"coxed%20four\"&gt;coxed four&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coxed%20pair\"&gt;coxed pair&lt;/a&gt; types of boat,the coxswain lies in the bow.\nIt is an advantage for the coxswain to be light as this requires less effort for the crew to propel the boat. In many competitive events there is a minimum weight, under World Rowing rules, set for the coxswain to prevent unfair advantage. If a coxswain is under the minimum weight allowance (underweight), they may have to carry weights in the boat such as sandbags.\nAthlete categories.\nAge.\nAt the elite level, the World Rowing Federation recognizes an under 19 category for athletes who are age 18 or less by the end of the calendar year for a given event. The &lt;a href=\"World%20Rowing%20Junior%20Championships\"&gt;World Rowing Junior Championships&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"world%20championship\"&gt;world championship&lt;/a&gt; event for this category. Athletes under 23 years of age by the end of the calendar year may compete in the under 23 category, and the &lt;a href=\"World%20Rowing%20U23%20Championships\"&gt;World Rowing U23 Championships&lt;/a&gt; is held for these athletes. World Rowing uses the term \"Senior\" for events open to any age.\nUnder World Rowing rules, athletes may compete in \"&lt;a href=\"Senior%20sport\"&gt;Masters&lt;/a&gt;\" categories when they reach age 27. World Rowing holds the &lt;a href=\"World%20Rowing%20Masters%20Regatta\"&gt;World Rowing Masters Regatta&lt;/a&gt; for these athletes, at which there are several age subcategories.\nWeight.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightweight%20rowing\"&gt;Lightweight boat classes&lt;/a&gt; are restricted by the rowers' weight. According to the World Rowing Federation, this weight category was introduced \"to encourage more universality in the sport especially among nations with less statuesque people\". The first lightweight events were held at the World Championships in &lt;a href=\"1974%20World%20Rowing%20Championships\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt; for men and &lt;a href=\"1985%20World%20Rowing%20Championships\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt; for women. Lightweight rowing was added to the Olympics in &lt;a href=\"1996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;. As of 2021, the only Olympic lightweight boat classes are the men's and women's double sculls.\nThe World Rowing Federation lightweight standards are:\nAt the &lt;a href=\"College%20rowing%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;collegiate level in the United States&lt;/a&gt;, the lightweight weight requirements can be different depending on competitive season. For fall regattas (typically head races), the lightweight cutoff for men is 165.0\u00a0lb. and 135.0\u00a0lb. for women. In the spring season (typically sprint races), the lightweight cutoff for men is 160.0\u00a0lb., with a boat average of 155.0\u00a0lb. for the crew; for women, the lightweight cutoff is 130.0\u00a0lb.\nFor juniors in the United States, the lightweight cutoff for men is 150.0\u00a0lb.; for women, it is 130.0\u00a0lb. In the fall the weight limits are increased for women, with the cutoff being 135\u00a0lb.\nPararowing.\nAdaptive rowing is a special category of races for those with physical disabilities. Under World Rowing rules there are 5 boat classes for adaptive rowers; mixed (2 men and 2 women plus cox) LTA (Legs, Trunk, Arms), mixed intellectual disability (2 men and 2 women plus cox) LTA (Legs, Trunk, Arms), mixed (1 man and 1 woman) TA (Trunk and Arms), and men's and women's AS (Arms and Shoulders). Events are held at the World Rowing Championships and were also held at the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;2008 Summer Paralympics&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoverning bodies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"World%20Rowing%20Federation\"&gt;World Rowing Federation&lt;/a&gt;, known as FISA until recently, is the sport's international governing body. World Rowing runs the &lt;a href=\"World%20Rowing%20Championships\"&gt;World Rowing Championships&lt;/a&gt;, as well as several other international elite competitions including the &lt;a href=\"World%20Rowing%20Cup\"&gt;World Rowing Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20Rowing%20Junior%20Championships\"&gt;World Rowing Junior Championships&lt;/a&gt;. World Rowing also sponsors &lt;a href=\"rowing%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;rowing at the Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld Rowing has over 155 who govern the sport in their respective nations.\nInternational competitions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; are held every four years, where only select boat classes are raced (14 in total):\nAt the end of each year, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Federation%20of%20Rowing%20Associations\"&gt;FISA&lt;/a&gt; holds the World Rowing Championships with events in 22 different boat classes. Athletes generally consider the Olympic classes to be premier events. In 2017 FISA voted to adopt a new Olympic programme for 2020, whereby the lightweight men's coxless four event was replaced by the women's heavyweight coxless four. This was done to ensure that rowing had a gender equal Olympic programme. During Olympic years only non-Olympic boats compete at the World Championships.\nFitness and health.\nRowing is one of the few bearing sports that &lt;a href=\"exercise\"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;s all the major muscle groups, including &lt;a href=\"Quadriceps%20femoris%20muscle\"&gt;quads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"biceps\"&gt;biceps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"triceps\"&gt;triceps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Latissimus%20dorsi%20muscle\"&gt;lats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gluteal%20muscles\"&gt;glutes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human%20abdomen\"&gt;abdominal&lt;/a&gt; muscles. The sport also improves &lt;a href=\"cardiovascular\"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt; endurance and &lt;a href=\"muscular%20strength\"&gt;muscular strength&lt;/a&gt;. High-performance rowers tend to be tall and muscular: although extra weight does increase the drag on the boat, the larger athletes' increased power tends to compensate. The increased power is achieved through the increased leverage on the oar provided by the longer limbs of the athlete. In multi-person boats (2,4, or 8), the lightest person typically rows in the bow seat at the front of the boat.\nRowing is a low-impact sport with movement only in defined ranges, so that twist and sprain injuries are rare. However, the repetitive rowing action can put strain on &lt;a href=\"knee%20joint\"&gt;knee joint&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"human%20vertebral%20column\"&gt;spine&lt;/a&gt; and the tendons of the forearm, and &lt;a href=\"inflammation\"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; of these are the most common rowing injuries. If one rows with poor technique, especially rowing with a curved rather than straight back, other injuries may surface, including back pains. Blisters occur for almost all rowers, especially in the beginning of one's rowing career, as every stroke puts pressure on the hands, though rowing frequently tends to harden hands and generate protective calluses. Holding the oars too tightly or making adjustments to technique may cause recurring or new blisters, as it is common to feather the blade. Another common injury is getting \"track bites\", thin cuts on the back of one's calf or thigh caused by contact with the seat tracks at either end of the stroke."
