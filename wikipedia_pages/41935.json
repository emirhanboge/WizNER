    "text": "Oldenburg () is an &lt;a href=\"independent%20city\"&gt;independent city&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Oldenburg%20%28district%29\"&gt;district of Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt; in the state of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Saxony\"&gt;Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt;, Germany. The city is officially named Oldenburg (Oldb) (\"Oldenburg in Oldenburg\") to distinguish from &lt;a href=\"Oldenburg%20in%20Holstein\"&gt;Oldenburg in Holstein&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the French annexation (1811\u20131813) in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic war&lt;/a&gt; against Britain, it was also known as \"Le Vieux-Bourg\" in French. The city is at the rivers &lt;a href=\"Hunte\"&gt;Hunte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haaren%20%28river%29\"&gt;Haaren&lt;/a&gt;, in the northwestern region between the cities of &lt;a href=\"Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt; in the east and &lt;a href=\"Groningen\"&gt;Groningen&lt;/a&gt; (Netherlands) in the west. It has a population of 170,000 (November 2019). Oldenburg is part of the &lt;a href=\"Bremen/Oldenburg%20Metropolitan%20Region\"&gt;Bremen/Oldenburg Metropolitan Region&lt;/a&gt;, with 2.37\u00a0million people.\nThe city is the place of origin of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Oldenburg\"&gt;House of Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt;. Before the end of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt; (1918), it was the administrative centre and residence of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Oldenburg\"&gt;monarchs of Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nArchaeological finds point to a settlement dating back to the 8th century. The first documentary evidence, in 1108, referenced \"Aldenburg\" in connection with &lt;a href=\"Elimar%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Oldenburg\"&gt;Elimar I&lt;/a&gt; (also known as Egilmar I) who is now commonly seen as the first count of Oldenburg. The town gained importance due to its location at a &lt;a href=\"ford%20%28river%29\"&gt;ford&lt;/a&gt; of the navigable Hunte river. Oldenburg became the capital of the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Oldenburg\"&gt;County of Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt; (later a &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Oldenburg\"&gt;Duchy&lt;/a&gt; (1774- 1810), &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Oldenburg\"&gt;Grand Duchy&lt;/a&gt; (1815\u20131918), and &lt;a href=\"Free%20State%20of%20Oldenburg\"&gt;Free State&lt;/a&gt; (1918\u20131946)), a small state in the shadow of the much more powerful &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20League\"&gt;Hanseatic&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Bremen%20%28city%29\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 17th century Oldenburg was a wealthy town in a time of &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;war and turmoil&lt;/a&gt; and its population and power grew considerably. In 1667, the town was struck by a disastrous &lt;a href=\"Black%20Death\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; epidemic and, shortly after, a fire destroyed Oldenburg. The Danish kings, who were also counts of Oldenburg at the time, had little interest in the condition of the town and it lost most of its former importance. In 1773, Danish rule ended. Only then were the destroyed buildings in the city rebuilt in a &lt;a href=\"Neoclassicism\"&gt;neoclassicist&lt;/a&gt; style. (&lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;-speakers usually call the \"neoclassicist style\" of that period ', while ' specifically refers to the classicist style of the early 20th century.)\nAfter the German government announced the abdication of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor\"&gt;Wilhelm II&lt;/a&gt; (9 November 1918) following the exhaustion and defeat of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, monarchic rule ended in Oldenburg as well with the abdication of Grand Duke &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Augustus%20II%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Oldenburg\"&gt;Frederick Augustus II of Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt; \"()\" on 11 November 1918. The Grand Duchy now became the Free State of Oldenburg \"()\", with the city remaining the capital.\nIn the 1928 city elections, the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Party\"&gt;Nazi Party&lt;/a&gt; received 9.8% of the vote, enough for a seat on the Oldenburg city council. In the September 1930 Oldenburg state elections, the Nazi Party's share of the vote rose to 27.3%, and on May 29, 1932, the Nazi Party received 48.4% in the state election, enough to put the Nazi party in charge of forming a state government and, significantly, making Oldenburg the first state in the country to put the Nazis in power based on electoral turnout. By that autumn, a campaign of &lt;a href=\"Aryanization%20%28Nazism%29\"&gt;Aryanization&lt;/a&gt; began, forcing the sale of formerly Jewish-owned properties at steep discounts.\nIn 1945, after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the State of Oldenburg became part of the &lt;a href=\"Allied-occupied%20Germany\"&gt;British zone of occupation&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Control%20Commission%20for%20Germany%20-%20British%20Element\"&gt;British military government&lt;/a&gt; of the Oldenburg region resided in the city. Several &lt;a href=\"displaced%20persons%20camp\"&gt;displaced-persons camp&lt;/a&gt;s were set up in the city that had suffered only 1.4% destruction during the &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20Bombing%20During%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;bombing campaigns of World War II&lt;/a&gt;. About 42,000 refugees migrated into Oldenburg, which raised the number of residents to over 100,000. In 1946 the Free State of Oldenburg was dissolved and the area became the 'Administrative District' of Oldenburg \"()\" within the newly formed &lt;a href=\"States%20of%20Germany\"&gt;federal German state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Saxony\"&gt;Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt; \"()\". The city was now capital of the district. In 1978 the district was dissolved and succeeded by the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Weser-Ems\"&gt;Weser-Ems&lt;/a&gt; administrative region \"()\", again with the city as administrative capital. The state of Lower Saxony dissolved all of the by the end of 2004 in the course of administrative reforms.\nCity government.\nLocal elections take place every five years. The city council \"(Stadtrat)\" has 50 seats. The &lt;a href=\"lord%20mayor\"&gt;lord mayor&lt;/a&gt; \"(Oberb\u00fcrgermeister)\" is elected directly by the citizens.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nTransport.\nThe city centre of Oldenburg is surrounded by a ring of freeways (&lt;a href=\"German%20autobahns\"&gt;autobahns&lt;/a&gt;) consisting of &lt;a href=\"Bundesautobahn%2028\"&gt;A 28&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bundesautobahn%2029\"&gt;A 29&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bundesautobahn%20293\"&gt;A 293&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, Oldenburg is connected to the nationwide network of federal autobahns, as well as to the &lt;a href=\"international%20E-road%20network\"&gt;international E-road network&lt;/a&gt; (German: \"Europastra\u00dfen\").\n&lt;a href=\"Oldenburg%20Central%20Station\"&gt;Oldenburg Central Station&lt;/a&gt;, \"Oldenburg (Oldb) Hauptbahnhof\", is at the intersection of the railway lines &lt;a href=\"Norddeich%20Mole%20station\"&gt;Norddeich Mole&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Leer\"&gt;Leer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Oldenburg\u2014Bremen and &lt;a href=\"Wilhelmshaven\"&gt;Wilhelmshaven&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Oldenburg\u2014Osnabr\u00fcck, with &lt;a href=\"Intercity%20%28Deutsche%20Bahn%29\"&gt;Intercity&lt;/a&gt; services to &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dresden\"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"InterCityExpress\"&gt;InterCityExpress&lt;/a&gt; services to &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;.\nOldenburg is only about half an hour drive from &lt;a href=\"Bremen%20Airport\"&gt;Bremen Airport&lt;/a&gt; (about 50\u00a0km | 31 miles). Other international airports nearby are &lt;a href=\"Hamburg%20Airport\"&gt;Hamburg Airport&lt;/a&gt; (160\u00a0km | 100 miles) and &lt;a href=\"Hannover-Langenhagen%20Airport\"&gt;Hannover-Langenhagen Airport&lt;/a&gt; (170\u00a0km | 106 miles).\nThe small &lt;a href=\"Hatten\"&gt;Hatten&lt;/a&gt; Airfield, (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.flugplatz-hatten.de\"&gt;Flugplatz Oldenburg-Hatten&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ICAO%20airport%20code\"&gt;ICAO airport code&lt;/a&gt;: EDWH), is located about 17\u00a0km south-west of Oldenburg. It serves to small aircraft (private planes, gliders, balloons, and helicopters). A flight training school is also located there, and small planes can be chartered. Scenic flights can be booked as well.\nOldenburg is connected to shipping through the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%BCstenkanal\"&gt;K\u00fcstenkanal&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"ship%20canal\"&gt;ship canal&lt;/a&gt; connecting the rivers &lt;a href=\"Ems%20%28river%29\"&gt;Ems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weser%20River\"&gt;Weser&lt;/a&gt;. With 1.6 million tons of goods annually, it is the most important non-coastal harbour in Lower Saxony.\n&lt;a href=\"Bicycle\"&gt;Bicycle&lt;/a&gt;s play a very important part in personal transport.\nAgriculture.\nThe city is surrounded by large agricultural areas, about 80% of which is grassland. There are farms near and even a few within city limits. Predominant agricultural activities of the region are the cultivation of livestock, especially dairy cows and other grazing animals, crops such as grains for food and animal feed, as well as asparagus, corn, and kale.\nIndustry.\nSea salt production in the Oldenburg region has been used since the 15th century to supply the huge salt demand in the Baltic region. Peat extraction in the area continued for many centuries until it was replaced by coal mines.\nDemographics.\nAs of 31.12.2019 Oldenburg had 169,960 residents. 24.8% of the population were first or second generation immigrants.\nCultural life.\nLutheran community.\nOldenburg is the seat of administration and bishop of the &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20in%20Oldenburg\"&gt;Evangelical Lutheran Church in Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt;, whose preaching venue is the &lt;a href=\"St%20Lamberti%20Church\"&gt;St Lamberti Church&lt;/a&gt;.\nJewish community.\nThe &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Oldenburg\"&gt;history of the Jewish community of Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt; dates back to the 14th century. Towards and during the 19th century, the Jews in Oldenburg were always around 1% of the total population, and by that time had acquired their own synagogue, cemetery and school. Most of them were merchants and businessmen. On 1938 &lt;a href=\"Kristallnacht\"&gt;Kristallnacht&lt;/a&gt;, the town men were led to &lt;a href=\"Sachsenhausen%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;Sachsenhausen concentration camp&lt;/a&gt;, among them &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Trepp\"&gt;Leo Trepp&lt;/a&gt;, the community &lt;a href=\"Rabbi\"&gt;Rabbi&lt;/a&gt; who survived and later became an honorary citizen of Oldenburg and honored by a street named after him. Since 1981 an annual commemoration walk (Erinnerungsgang) has been held by Oldenburg citizens in memory of the deportation of the Oldenburg Jews on November 10, 1938. Those who remained after 1938 emigrated to Canada, USA, United Kingdom, Holland or Mandatory Palestine.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, a group of survivors returned to the city and maintained a small community until it was dissolved during the 1970s. Nevertheless, due to Jewish emigration from the former &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt; to Germany in the 1990s, a community of about 340 people is now maintaining its own synagogue, cemetery and other facilities. The old Jewish cemetery, which is no longer active after the opening of a new one, was desecrated twice in 2011 and 2013.\nEducation.\nTertiary education.\nThere are two &lt;a href=\"Public%20university\"&gt;public universities&lt;/a&gt; in Oldenburg:\nPrivately managed institutions of higher education:\nOther:\nSports.\nOldenburg hosted the &lt;a href=\"Fistball%23Fistball%20World%20Championship%20-%20Men\"&gt;2007 Fistball World Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has two &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; teams, &lt;a href=\"VfB%20Oldenburg\"&gt;VfB Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"VfL%20Oldenburg\"&gt;VfL Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt;, who also have a &lt;a href=\"Handball%20%28sport%29\"&gt;handball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"VfL%20Oldenburg%20%28handball%29\"&gt;section of the same name&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoreover, Oldenburg is home to the &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"EWE%20Baskets%20Oldenburg\"&gt;EWE Baskets Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nDatteln is &lt;a href=\"Sister%20city\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with:\nNotable people.\nAssociated with Oldenburg.\nSee in particular the &lt;a href=\"Counts%2C%20dukes%20and%20grand%20dukes%20of%20Oldenburg\"&gt;Counts, Dukes and Grand Dukes of Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt; for the rulers who were not born in Oldenburg."
