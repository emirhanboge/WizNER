    "text": "Bobby Henderson (April 16, 1910 \u2013 December 9, 1969) was an American &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; musician, who also performed under the name Jody Bolden.\nBiography.\nBobby Henderson was born in New York City on April 16, 1910, to a single mother, who was middle-aged at the time he was born. He was her only child, and he lived with her for much of his life. Henderson began playing piano at the age of nine, and some years later studied bookkeeping in college. He left college suddenly one day, without notice or regret, to become a professional musician. During his career in music, he was known as a warm, kind and gentle person, who lived quietly with his mother.\nHenderson was a great admirer of pianist &lt;a href=\"Fats%20Waller\"&gt;Fats Waller&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Henderson had an opportunity to play, informally. After Waller's death, in 1943, Henderson was regarded as the successor to Waller. This did not occur, as Henderson had largely disappeared from music at that time\nHenderson was briefly engaged to the teenaged &lt;a href=\"Billie%20Holiday\"&gt;Billie Holiday&lt;/a&gt; in 1934, whom he met and accompanied at the nightclub &lt;a href=\"Pod%27s%20and%20Jerry%27s\"&gt;Pod's and Jerry's&lt;/a&gt;, but on December 1 that year the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Age\"&gt;New York Age&lt;/a&gt;\" announced that he was no longer engaged to her.\nSubsequent to the termination of his engagement to Billie Holiday, Henderson went into self-imposed exile for over twenty years. He changed his name to Jody Bolden, in honor of jazz &lt;a href=\"cornetist\"&gt;cornetist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buddy%20Bolden\"&gt;Buddy Bolden&lt;/a&gt; who, suffering from schizophrenia, had died in an asylum in 1931. Henderson was rediscovered and recorded by &lt;a href=\"John%20Hammond%20%28producer%29\"&gt;John Hammond&lt;/a&gt; in 1956, and appeared at the &lt;a href=\"Newport%20Jazz%20Festival\"&gt;Newport Jazz Festival&lt;/a&gt; in 1957; a recording appeared on an album shared with &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Braff\"&gt;Ruby Braff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pee%20Wee%20Russell\"&gt;Pee Wee Russell&lt;/a&gt;'s group. Hammond had first known Henderson in the 1930s, during Henderson's time playing with Holiday. At the time of the termination of his engagement to Holiday, Henderson had been contracted by Hammond for an important recording session, which Henderson did not attend, and instead disappeared.\nHenderson died in &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Albany, New York&lt;/a&gt;, in 1969.\nSelected discography.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Williams%20%28jazz%20singer%29\"&gt;Joe Williams&lt;/a&gt;"
