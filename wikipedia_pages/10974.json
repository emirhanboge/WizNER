The franchise centers on a series of fantasy and science fantasy &lt;a href=\"role-playing%20video%20game\"&gt;role-playing video game&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;first game in the series&lt;/a&gt; was released in 1987, with 15 numbered main entries having been released to date and an upcoming 16th installment announced in 2020. The franchise has since branched into other &lt;a href=\"video%20game%20genres\"&gt;video game genres&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"tactical%20role-playing%20game\"&gt;tactical role-playing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"action%20role-playing%20game\"&gt;action role-playing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"massively%20multiplayer%20online%20role-playing%20game\"&gt;massively multiplayer online role-playing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"racing%20video%20game\"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"third-person%20shooter\"&gt;third-person shooter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighting%20game\"&gt;fighting&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rhythm%20game\"&gt;rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, as well as branching into other media, including &lt;a href=\"Computer-generated%20imagery\"&gt;CGI&lt;/a&gt; films, &lt;a href=\"anime\"&gt;anime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"manga\"&gt;manga&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"novel\"&gt;novel&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"Final Fantasy\" installments are generally stand-alone stories or role playing games, each with different settings, plots and main characters, but the franchise is linked by several recurring elements, including game mechanics and recurring character names. Each plot centers on a particular group of heroes who are battling a great evil, but also explores the characters' internal struggles and relationships. Character names are frequently derived from the history, languages, &lt;a href=\"pop%20culture\"&gt;pop culture&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"mythologies\"&gt;mythologies&lt;/a&gt; of cultures worldwide. The mechanics of each game involve similar battle systems and maps.\nThe \"Final Fantasy\" video game series has been both critically and commercially successful, with some entries (&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20IV\"&gt;IV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20VI\"&gt;VI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20VII\"&gt;VII&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20VIII\"&gt;VIII&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20IX\"&gt;IX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20X\"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20XIV\"&gt;XIV&lt;/a&gt;) regarded by many as some of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best\"&gt;the greatest video games&lt;/a&gt;, and the series as a whole selling more than software units worldwide, making it one of the &lt;a href=\"best-selling%20video%20game%20franchises\"&gt;best-selling video game franchises&lt;/a&gt; of all time. The series is well known for its innovation, visuals, such as the inclusion of &lt;a href=\"full%20motion%20video\"&gt;full-motion video&lt;/a&gt;s (FMVs), &lt;a href=\"Photorealism\"&gt;photorealistic&lt;/a&gt; character models, and music by &lt;a href=\"Nobuo%20Uematsu\"&gt;Nobuo Uematsu&lt;/a&gt;. It has popularized many features now common in role-playing games, also popularizing the genre as a whole in markets outside &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedia.\nGames.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;first installment&lt;/a&gt; of the series was released in Japan on December 18, 1987. Subsequent games are numbered and given a story unrelated to previous games, so the numbers refer to volumes rather than to sequels. Many \"Final Fantasy\" games have been &lt;a href=\"Internationalization%20and%20localization\"&gt;localized&lt;/a&gt; for markets in North America, Europe, and Australia on numerous &lt;a href=\"video%20game%20console\"&gt;video game console&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"personal%20computer\"&gt;personal computer&lt;/a&gt;s (PC), and &lt;a href=\"mobile%20phone\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt;s. Future installments will appear on &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28seventh%20generation%29\"&gt;seventh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28eighth%20generation%29\"&gt;eighth generation consoles&lt;/a&gt;. As of November 2016, the series includes the main installments from \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;\" to \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20XV\"&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as direct sequels and &lt;a href=\"Spin-off%20%28media%29\"&gt;spin-off&lt;/a&gt;s, both released and confirmed as being in development. Most of the older games have been remade or re-released on multiple platforms.\nMain series.\nThree \"Final Fantasy\" installments were released on the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System\"&gt;Nintendo Entertainment System&lt;/a&gt; (NES). \"Final Fantasy\" was released in Japan in 1987 and in North America in 1990. It introduced many concepts to the console RPG genre, and has since been remade on several platforms. \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII\"&gt;Final Fantasy\u00a0II&lt;/a&gt;\", released in 1988 in Japan, has been bundled with \"Final Fantasy\" in several re-releases. The last of the NES installments, \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII\"&gt;Final Fantasy\u00a0III&lt;/a&gt;\", was released in Japan in 1990; however, it was not released elsewhere until a &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Video%20game%20remake\"&gt;remake&lt;/a&gt; in 2006.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System\"&gt;Super Nintendo Entertainment System&lt;/a&gt; (SNES) also featured three installments of the main series, all of which have been re-released on several platforms. \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIV\"&gt;Final Fantasy\u00a0IV&lt;/a&gt;\" was released in 1991; in North America, it was released as \"Final Fantasy\u00a0II\". It introduced the \"&lt;a href=\"Gameplay%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%23Parties%20and%20battles\"&gt;Active Time Battle&lt;/a&gt;\" system. \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BV\"&gt;Final Fantasy\u00a0V&lt;/a&gt;\", released in 1992 in Japan, was the first game in the series to spawn a sequel: a short anime series, \"\". \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVI\"&gt;Final Fantasy\u00a0VI&lt;/a&gt;\" was released in Japan in 1994, titled \"Final Fantasy\u00a0III\" in North America.\nThe &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20%28console%29\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; console saw the release of three main \"Final Fantasy\" games. \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVII\"&gt;Final Fantasy\u00a0VII&lt;/a&gt;\" (1997) moved away from the &lt;a href=\"2D%20computer%20graphics\"&gt;two-dimensional (2D) graphics&lt;/a&gt; used in the first six games to &lt;a href=\"3D%20computer%20graphics\"&gt;three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics&lt;/a&gt;; the game features &lt;a href=\"polygon%20%28computer%20graphics%29\"&gt;polygonal&lt;/a&gt; characters on &lt;a href=\"Pre-rendering\"&gt;pre-rendered&lt;/a&gt; backgrounds. It also introduced a more modern setting, a style that was carried over to the next game. It was also the second in the series to be released in Europe, with the first being \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20Mystic%20Quest\"&gt;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&lt;/a&gt;\". \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20VIII\"&gt;Final Fantasy VIII&lt;/a&gt;\" was published in 1999, and was the first to consistently use realistically proportioned characters and feature a vocal piece as its theme music. \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIX\"&gt;Final Fantasy\u00a0IX&lt;/a&gt;\", released in 2000, returned to the series' roots by revisiting a more traditional \"Final Fantasy\" setting rather than the more modern worlds of \"VII\" and \"VIII\".\nThree main installments, as well as one online game, were published for the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; (PS2). \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BX\"&gt;Final Fantasy\u00a0X&lt;/a&gt;\" (2001) introduced full 3D areas and &lt;a href=\"voice%20acting\"&gt;voice acting&lt;/a&gt; to the series, and was the first to spawn a sub-sequel (\"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20X-2\"&gt;Final Fantasy X-2&lt;/a&gt;\", published in 2003). The first massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) in the series, \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BXI\"&gt;Final Fantasy\u00a0XI&lt;/a&gt;\", was released on the PS2 and PC in 2002, and later on the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;. It introduced real-time battles instead of &lt;a href=\"random%20encounter\"&gt;random encounter&lt;/a&gt;s. \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20XII\"&gt;Final Fantasy XII&lt;/a&gt;\", published in 2006, also includes real-time battles in large, interconnected playfields. The game is also the first in the main series to utilize a world used in a previous game, namely the land of &lt;a href=\"Ivalice\"&gt;Ivalice&lt;/a&gt;, which had previously featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20Tactics\"&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Vagrant%20Story\"&gt;Vagrant Story&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2009, \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20XIII\"&gt;Final Fantasy XIII&lt;/a&gt;\" was released in Japan, and in North America and Europe the following year, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is the flagship installment of the \"&lt;a href=\"Fabula%20Nova%20Crystallis%20Final%20Fantasy\"&gt;Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;\" series and became the first mainline game to spawn two sub-sequels (\"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20XIII-2\"&gt;XIII-2&lt;/a&gt;\" and '). It was also the first game released in Chinese and &lt;a href=\"High-definition%20video\"&gt;high definition&lt;/a&gt; along with being released on two consoles at once. \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20XIV%20%282010%20video%20game%29\"&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/a&gt;\", a MMORPG, was released worldwide on &lt;a href=\"Microsoft%20Windows\"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, but it received heavy criticism when it was launched, prompting Square Enix to rerelease the game as ', this time to the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; as well, in 2013. \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20XV\"&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/a&gt;\" is an action role-playing game that was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2016. Originally a \"XIII\" spin-off titled \"Versus XIII\", \"XV\" uses the mythos of the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" series, although in many other respects the game stands on its own and has since been distanced from the series by its developers. The next mainline entry, \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20XVI\"&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/a&gt;\", was announced in September 2020 for the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%205\"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nRemakes, sequels and spin-offs.\n\"Final Fantasy\" has spawned numerous &lt;a href=\"Spin-off%20%28media%29\"&gt;spin-offs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Media%20franchise\"&gt;metaseries&lt;/a&gt;. Several are, in fact, not \"Final Fantasy\" games, but were rebranded for North American release. Examples include the &lt;a href=\"SaGa\"&gt;\"SaGa\" series&lt;/a&gt;, rebranded \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Fantasy%20Legend\"&gt;The Final Fantasy Legend&lt;/a&gt;\", and its two sequels, \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20Legend%20II\"&gt;Final Fantasy Legend II&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20Legend%20III\"&gt;Final Fantasy Legend III&lt;/a&gt;\". \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20Mystic%20Quest\"&gt;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&lt;/a&gt;\" was specifically developed for a United States audience, and \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20Tactics\"&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics&lt;/a&gt;\" is a &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20role-playing%20game\"&gt;tactical RPG&lt;/a&gt; that features many references and themes found in the series. The spin-off &lt;a href=\"Chocobo%E2%80%99s%20Chocotto%20Farm\"&gt;\"Chocobo\" series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20Crystal%20Chronicles\"&gt;\"Crystal Chronicles\" series&lt;/a&gt;, and \"&lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20Hearts\"&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/a&gt;\" series also include multiple \"Final Fantasy\" elements. In 2003, the \"Final Fantasy\" series' first sub-sequel, \"Final Fantasy X-2\", was released. \"Final Fantasy XIII\" was originally intended to stand on its own, but the team wanted to explore the world, characters and mythos more, resulting in the development and release of two sequels in &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20XIII-2\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; and respectively, creating the series' first official trilogy. \"&lt;a href=\"Dissidia%20Final%20Fantasy\"&gt;Dissidia Final Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;\" was released in 2009, a &lt;a href=\"fighting%20game\"&gt;fighting game&lt;/a&gt; that features heroes and villains from the first ten games of the main series. It was followed by a &lt;a href=\"Dissidia%20012%20Final%20Fantasy\"&gt;prequel&lt;/a&gt; in 2011. Other spin-offs have taken the form of subseries\u2014\"&lt;a href=\"Compilation%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVII\"&gt;Compilation of Final Fantasy\u00a0VII&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Ivalice%20Alliance\"&gt;Ivalice Alliance&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy\". Enhanced 3D remakes of \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20III%20%282006%20video%20game%29\"&gt;Final Fantasy III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20IV%20%282007%20video%20game%29\"&gt;Final Fantasy IV&lt;/a&gt;\" were released in 2006 and 2007 respectively. \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20VII%20Remake\"&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/a&gt;\" was released on the PlayStation 4 in 2020.\nOther media.\nFilm and television.\nSquare Enix has expanded the \"Final Fantasy\" series into various media. Multiple anime and &lt;a href=\"computer-generated%20imagery\"&gt;computer-generated imagery&lt;/a&gt; (CGI) films have been produced that are based either on individual \"Final Fantasy\" games or on the series as a whole. The first was an &lt;a href=\"original%20video%20animation\"&gt;original video animation&lt;/a&gt; (OVA), ', a sequel to \"Final Fantasy\u00a0V\". The story was set in the same world as the game, although 200 years in the future. It was released as four 30-minute episodes, first in Japan in 1994 and later in the United States by &lt;a href=\"Urban%20Vision\"&gt;Urban Vision&lt;/a&gt; in 1998. In 2001, &lt;a href=\"Square%20Pictures\"&gt;Square Pictures&lt;/a&gt; released its first feature film, '. The film is set on a future &lt;a href=\"Earth\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; invaded by &lt;a href=\"Extraterrestrial%20life\"&gt;alien&lt;/a&gt; life forms. \"The Spirits Within\" was the first animated feature to seriously attempt to portray photorealistic CGI humans, but was considered a &lt;a href=\"box%20office%20bomb\"&gt;box office bomb&lt;/a&gt; and garnered mixed reviews.\nA 25-episode anime television series, \",\" was released in 2001 based on the common elements of the \"Final Fantasy\" series. It was broadcast in Japan by &lt;a href=\"TV%20Tokyo\"&gt;TV Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; and released in North America by &lt;a href=\"ADV%20Films\"&gt;ADV Films&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2005, ', a feature length &lt;a href=\"Direct-to-video\"&gt;direct-to-DVD&lt;/a&gt; CGI film, and ', a non-canon OVA, were released as part of the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\". \"Advent Children\" was animated by Visual Works, which helped the company create CG sequences for the games. The film, unlike \"The Spirits Within\", became a commercial success. \"Last Order,\" on the other hand, was released in Japan in a special DVD bundle package with \"Advent Children\". \"Last Order\" sold out quickly and was positively received by Western critics, though fan reaction was mixed over changes to established story scenes.\nTwo animated tie-ins for \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20XV\"&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/a&gt;\" were announced at the Uncovered Final Fantasy XV fan and press event, forming part of a larger multimedia project dubbed the \"Final Fantasy XV\" Universe. ' is a series of five 10-to-20-minute-long episodes developed by &lt;a href=\"A-1%20Pictures\"&gt;A-1 Pictures&lt;/a&gt; and Square Enix detailing the backstories of the main cast. ', a CGI movie set for release prior to the game in Summer 2016, is set during the game's opening and follows new and secondary characters.\nOn February 26, 2019, Square Enix released a short anime, produced by &lt;a href=\"Satelight\"&gt;Satelight Inc&lt;/a&gt;, called \"Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn \u2013 Prologue\" on their YouTube channel which acts as the background story for the final piece of DLC for \"Final Fantasy XV\" giving insight into Ardyn's past.\nSquare Enix also released \"\", an 8-episode Japanese soap opera. It features a mix of live-action scenes and \"Final Fantasy XIV\" gameplay footage. It premiered in Japan on April 16, 2017, and became available worldwide via &lt;a href=\"Netflix\"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; in September of the same year.\nIt was announced in June 2019 that &lt;a href=\"Sony%20Pictures%20Television\"&gt;Sony Pictures Television&lt;/a&gt; is working on a first ever live-action adaptation of the series with Hivemind and Square Enix. Jason F. Brown, Sean Daniel and Dinesh Shamdasani for Hivemind will be the producers while Ben Lustig and &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Thornton\"&gt;Jake Thornton&lt;/a&gt; will write for the series and will serve as executive producers.\nOther media.\nSeveral video games have either been adapted into or have had spin-offs in the form of &lt;a href=\"manga\"&gt;manga&lt;/a&gt; and novels. The first was the novelization of \"Final Fantasy\u00a0II\" in 1989, and was followed by a manga adaptation of \"Final Fantasy\u00a0III\" in 1992. The past decade has seen an increase in the number of non-video game adaptations and spin-offs. \"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\" has been adapted into a novel, the spin-off game \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20Crystal%20Chronicles\"&gt;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;\" has been adapted into a manga, and \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\" has had a novel and manga set in its continuity. Seven &lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Way%20to%20a%20Smile\"&gt;novella&lt;/a&gt;s based on the \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVII\"&gt;Final Fantasy\u00a0VII&lt;/a&gt;\" universe have also been released. The \"Final Fantasy: Unlimited\" story was partially continued in novels and a manga after the anime series ended. The \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Final Fantasy XIII\" series have also had novellas and audio dramas released. \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20Tactics%20Advance\"&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" has been adapted into a &lt;a href=\"radio%20drama\"&gt;radio drama&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Final Fantasy: Unlimited\" has received a radio drama sequel.\nA &lt;a href=\"collectible%20card%20game\"&gt;trading card game&lt;/a&gt; named the \"Final Fantasy trading card game\" is produced by Square Enix and &lt;a href=\"Hobby%20Japan\"&gt;Hobby Japan&lt;/a&gt;, first released Japan in 2012 with an English version in 2016. The game has been compared to \"\", and a tournament circuit for the game also takes place.\nCommon elements.\nAlthough most \"Final Fantasy\" installments are independent, many &lt;a href=\"gameplay\"&gt;gameplay&lt;/a&gt; elements recur throughout the series. Most games contain elements of fantasy and science fiction and feature recycled names often inspired from various cultures' history, languages and mythology, including &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Asia\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Europe\"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle-Eastern&lt;/a&gt;. Examples include weapon names like &lt;a href=\"Excalibur\"&gt;Excalibur&lt;/a&gt; and Masamune\u2014derived from &lt;a href=\"Matter%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Arthurian legend&lt;/a&gt; and the Japanese swordsmith &lt;a href=\"Masamune\"&gt;Masamune&lt;/a&gt; respectively\u2014as well as the spell names Holy, Meteor, and Ultima. Beginning with \"Final Fantasy\u00a0IV\", the main series adopted its current logo style that features the same &lt;a href=\"typeface\"&gt;typeface&lt;/a&gt; and an emblem designed by Japanese artist &lt;a href=\"Yoshitaka%20Amano\"&gt;Yoshitaka Amano&lt;/a&gt;. The emblem relates to a game's plot and typically portrays a character or object in the story. Subsequent remakes of the first three games have replaced the previous logos with ones similar to the rest of the series.\nPlot and themes.\nThe central conflict in many \"Final Fantasy\" games focuses on a group of characters battling an evil, and sometimes ancient, antagonist that dominates the game's world. Stories frequently involve a &lt;a href=\"sovereign%20state\"&gt;sovereign state&lt;/a&gt; in rebellion, with the protagonists taking part in the rebellion. The heroes are often destined to defeat the evil, and occasionally gather as a direct result of the antagonist's malicious actions. Another staple of the series is the existence of two villains; the main villain is not always who it appears to be, as the primary antagonist may actually be subservient to another character or entity. The main antagonist introduced at the beginning of the game is not always the final enemy, and the characters must continue their quest beyond what appears to be the final fight.\nStories in the series frequently emphasize the internal struggles, passions, and tragedies of the characters, and the main plot often recedes into the background as the focus shifts to their personal lives. Games also explore relationships between characters, ranging from &lt;a href=\"love\"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; to rivalry. Other recurring situations that drive the plot include &lt;a href=\"amnesia\"&gt;amnesia&lt;/a&gt;, a hero corrupted by an evil force, mistaken identity, and &lt;a href=\"Self-denial\"&gt;self-sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;. Magical orbs and crystals are recurring in-game items that are frequently connected to the themes of the games' plots. Crystals often play a central role in the creation of the world, and a majority of the \"Final Fantasy\" games link crystals and orbs to the planet's &lt;a href=\"Energy%20%28esotericism%29\"&gt;life force&lt;/a&gt;. As such, control over these crystals drives the main conflict. The &lt;a href=\"classical%20element\"&gt;classical element&lt;/a&gt;s are also a recurring theme in the series related to the heroes, villains, and items. Other common plot and setting themes include the &lt;a href=\"Gaia%20hypothesis\"&gt;Gaia hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"apocalypse\"&gt;apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, and conflicts between advanced &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacters.\nThe series features a number of recurring character archetypes. Most famously, every game since \"Final Fantasy\u00a0II\", including subsequent remakes of the original \"Final Fantasy\", features a character named &lt;a href=\"Cid%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29\"&gt;Cid&lt;/a&gt;. Cid's appearance, personality, goals, and role in the game (non-playable ally, party member, villain) vary dramatically. However, two characteristics many versions of Cid have in common are 1) being a scientist or engineer, and 2) being tied in some way to an airship the party eventually acquires. Every Cid has at least one of these two traits.\n&lt;a href=\"Biggs%20and%20Wedge\"&gt;Biggs and Wedge&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by two \"&lt;a href=\"Star%20Wars\"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;\" characters of the same name, appear in numerous games as minor characters, sometimes as comic relief. The later games in the series feature several males with &lt;a href=\"effeminacy\"&gt;effeminate&lt;/a&gt; characteristics. Recurring creatures include &lt;a href=\"Chocobo\"&gt;Chocobo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Moogle\"&gt;Moogle&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Cactuar\"&gt;Cactuar&lt;/a&gt;s. Chocobos are large, often flightless birds that appear in several installments as a means of long-distance travel for characters. Moogles are white, stout creatures resembling teddy bears with wings and a single antenna. They serve different roles in games including mail delivery, &lt;a href=\"Metalsmith\"&gt;weaponsmiths&lt;/a&gt;, party members, and &lt;a href=\"Saved%20game\"&gt;saving the game&lt;/a&gt;. Cactuars are &lt;a href=\"Anthropomorphism\"&gt;anthropomorphic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cactus\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt; with \"&lt;a href=\"haniwa\"&gt;haniwa&lt;/a&gt;\"-like faces presented in a running or dashing pose. They usually appear as recurring enemy units, and also as &lt;a href=\"Recurring%20elements%20in%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20series%23Summoning\"&gt;summoned allies&lt;/a&gt; or friendly &lt;a href=\"non-player%20character\"&gt;non-player character&lt;/a&gt;s in certain titles. Chocobo and Moogle appearances are often accompanied by specific &lt;a href=\"Theme%20%28music%29\"&gt;musical themes&lt;/a&gt; that have been arranged differently for separate games.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Final Fantasy\" games, players command a party of characters as they progress through the game's story by exploring the game world and defeating enemies. Enemies are typically &lt;a href=\"Random%20encounter\"&gt;encountered randomly&lt;/a&gt; through exploring, a trend which changed in \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\" and \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\". The player issues combat orders\u2014like \"Fight\", \"Magic\", and \"Item\"\u2014to individual characters via a menu-driven interface while engaging in battles. Throughout the series, the games have used different battle systems. Prior to \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\", battles were turn-based with the protagonists and antagonists on different sides of the battlefield. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0IV\" introduced the \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system that augmented the turn-based nature with a perpetual time-keeping system. Designed by &lt;a href=\"Hiroyuki%20Ito\"&gt;Hiroyuki Ito&lt;/a&gt;, it injected urgency and excitement into combat by requiring the player to act before an enemy attacks, and was used until \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20X\"&gt;Final Fantasy\u00a0X&lt;/a&gt;\", which implemented the \"Conditional Turn-Based\" (CTB) system. This new system returned to the previous turn-based system, but added nuances to offer players more challenge. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\" adopted a real-time battle system where characters continuously act depending on the issued command. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\" continued this gameplay with the \"Active Dimension Battle\" system. \"Final Fantasy XIII\"s combat system, designed by the same man who worked on \"X\", was meant to have an action-oriented feel, emulating the cinematic battles in \"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\". The latest installment to the franchise, \"Final Fantasy XV\", introduces a new \"Open Combat\" system. Unlike previous battle systems in the franchise, the \"Open Combat\" system (OCS) allows players to take on a fully active battle scenario, allowing for free range attacks and movement, giving a much more fluid feel of combat. This system also incorporates a \"Tactical\" Option during battle, which pauses active battle to allow use of items.\nLike most RPGs, the \"Final Fantasy\" installments use an &lt;a href=\"Experience%20point\"&gt;experience level&lt;/a&gt; system for character advancement, in which experience points are accumulated by killing enemies. &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20character%20jobs\"&gt;Character classes&lt;/a&gt;, specific jobs that enable unique abilities for characters, are another recurring theme. Introduced in the first game, character classes have been used differently in each game. Some restrict a character to a single job to integrate it into the story, while other games feature dynamic job systems that allow the player to choose from multiple classes and switch throughout the game. Though used heavily in many games, such systems have become less prevalent in favor of characters that are more versatile; characters still match an archetype, but are able to learn skills outside their class.\n&lt;a href=\"Gameplay%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%23Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; is another common RPG element in the series. The method by which characters gain magic varies between installments, but is generally divided into classes organized by color: \"White magic\", which focuses on spells that assist teammates; \"Black magic\", which focuses on harming enemies; \"Red magic\", which is a combination of white and black magic, \"Blue magic\", which mimics enemy attacks; and \"Green magic\" which focuses on applying &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s to either allies or enemies. Other types of magic frequently appear such as \"Time magic\", focusing on the themes of time, space, and gravity; and \"Summoning magic\", which &lt;a href=\"Evocation\"&gt;evokes&lt;/a&gt; legendary creatures to aid in battle and is a feature that has persisted since \"Final Fantasy\u00a0III\". Summoned creatures are often referred to by names like \"Espers\" or \"Eidolons\" and have been inspired by mythologies from &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20mythology\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20mythology\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norse%20mythology\"&gt;Norse&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Greek%20mythology\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; cultures.\nDifferent means of transportation have appeared through the series. The most common is the airship for long range travel, accompanied by chocobos for travelling short distances, but others include sea and land vessels. Following \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\", more modern and futuristic vehicle designs have been included.\nDevelopment and history.\nOrigin.\nIn the mid-1980s, Square entered the Japanese &lt;a href=\"video%20game%20industry\"&gt;video game industry&lt;/a&gt; with simple RPGs, &lt;a href=\"racing%20video%20game\"&gt;racing games&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"platform%20game\"&gt;platformers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Nintendo\"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Family%20Computer%20Disk%20System\"&gt;Famicom Disk System&lt;/a&gt;. In 1987, Square designer &lt;a href=\"Hironobu%20Sakaguchi\"&gt;Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt; chose to create a new fantasy role-playing game for the cartridge-based NES, and drew inspiration from popular fantasy games: &lt;a href=\"Enix\"&gt;Enix&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Warrior\"&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/a&gt;\", Nintendo's \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20%281986%20video%20game%29\"&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Origin%20Systems\"&gt;Origin Systems&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ultima%20%28series%29\"&gt;\"Ultima\" series&lt;/a&gt;. Though often attributed to the company allegedly facing bankruptcy, Sakaguchi explained that the game was his personal last-ditch effort in the game industry and that its title, \"Final Fantasy\", stemmed from his feelings at the time; had the game not sold well, he would have quit the business and gone back to university. Despite his explanation, publications have also attributed the name to the company's hopes that the project would solve its financial troubles. In 2015, Sakaguchi explained the name's origin: the team wanted a title that would abbreviate to \"FF\", which would sound good in Japanese. The name was originally going to be \"Fighting Fantasy\", but due to concerns over trademark conflicts with the &lt;a href=\"Fighting%20Fantasy\"&gt;roleplaying gamebook series of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, they needed to settle for something else. As the English word \"Final\" was well-known in Japan, Sakaguchi settled on that. According to Sakaguchi, any title that created the \"FF\" abbreviation would have done.\nThe game indeed reversed Square's lagging fortunes, and it became the company's flagship franchise. Following the success, Square immediately developed a second installment. Because Sakaguchi assumed \"Final Fantasy\" would be a stand-alone game, its story was not designed to be expanded by a sequel. The developers instead chose to carry over only thematic similarities from its predecessor, while some of the &lt;a href=\"gameplay\"&gt;gameplay&lt;/a&gt; elements, such as the character advancement system, were overhauled. This approach has continued throughout the series; each major \"Final Fantasy\" game features a new setting, a new cast of characters, and an upgraded battle system. Video game writer John Harris attributed the concept of reworking the game system of each installment to &lt;a href=\"Nihon%20Falcom\"&gt;Nihon Falcom&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20%28series%29\"&gt;Dragon Slayer&lt;/a&gt;\" series, with which Square was previously involved as a publisher. The company regularly released new games in the main series. However, the time between the releases of \"Final Fantasy XI\" (2002), \"Final Fantasy XII\" (2006), and \"Final Fantasy XIII\" (2009) were much longer than previous games. Following \"Final Fantasy XIV\", Square Enix stated that it intended to release \"Final Fantasy\" games either annually or biennially. This switch was to mimic the development cycles of Western games in the \"&lt;a href=\"Call%20of%20Duty\"&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Assassin%27s%20Creed\"&gt;Assassin's Creed&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Battlefield%20%28video%20game%20series%29\"&gt;Battlefield&lt;/a&gt;\" series, as well as maintain fan-interest.\nDesign.\nFor the original \"Final Fantasy\", Sakaguchi required a larger production team than Square's previous games. He began crafting the game's story while experimenting with gameplay ideas. Once the gameplay system and game world size were established, Sakaguchi integrated his story ideas into the available resources. A different approach has been taken for subsequent games; the story is completed first and the game built around it. Designers have never been restricted by consistency, though most feel each game should have a minimum number of common elements. The development teams strive to create completely new worlds for each game, and avoid making new games too similar to previous ones. Game locations are conceptualized early in development and design details like building parts are fleshed out as a base for entire structures.\nThe first five games were directed by Sakaguchi, who also provided the original concepts. He drew inspiration for game elements from anime films by &lt;a href=\"Hayao%20Miyazaki\"&gt;Hayao Miyazaki&lt;/a&gt;; series staples like the airships and chocobos are inspired by elements in \"&lt;a href=\"Castle%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Castle in the Sky&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Nausica%C3%A4%20of%20the%20Valley%20of%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29\"&gt;Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind&lt;/a&gt;\", respectively. Sakaguchi served as a producer for subsequent games until he left Square in 2001. &lt;a href=\"Yoshinori%20Kitase\"&gt;Yoshinori Kitase&lt;/a&gt; took over directing the games until \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VIII\", and has been followed by a new director for each new game. &lt;a href=\"Hiroyuki%20Ito\"&gt;Hiroyuki Ito&lt;/a&gt; designed several gameplay systems, including \"Final Fantasy\u00a0V\"s \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20V%23Job%20System\"&gt;Job System&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VIII\"s \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20VIII%20Guardian%20Forces\"&gt;Junction System&lt;/a&gt;\" and the Active Time Battle concept, which was used from \"Final Fantasy\u00a0IV\" until \"Final Fantasy\u00a0IX\". In designing the Active Time Battle system, Ito drew inspiration from &lt;a href=\"Formula%20One\"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; racing; he thought it would be interesting if character types had different speeds after watching race cars pass each other. Ito also co-directed \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VI\" with Kitase. &lt;a href=\"Kenji%20Terada\"&gt;Kenji Terada&lt;/a&gt; was the scenario writer for the first three games; Kitase took over as scenario writer for \"Final Fantasy\u00a0V\" through \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\". &lt;a href=\"Kazushige%20Nojima\"&gt;Kazushige Nojima&lt;/a&gt; became the series' primary scenario writer from \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\" until his resignation in October 2003; he has since formed his own company, Stellavista. Nojima partially or completely wrote the stories for \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\", \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VIII\", \"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\", and \"Final Fantasy X-2\". He also worked as the scenario writer for the spin-off series, \"Kingdom Hearts\". &lt;a href=\"Daisuke%20Watanabe\"&gt;Daisuke Watanabe&lt;/a&gt; co-wrote the scenarios for \"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\" and \"XII\", and was the main writer for the \"XIII\" games.\nArtistic design, including character and monster creations, was handled by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from \"Final Fantasy\" through \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VI\". Amano also handled title logo designs for all of the main series and the image illustrations from \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\" onward. &lt;a href=\"Tetsuya%20Nomura\"&gt;Tetsuya Nomura&lt;/a&gt; was chosen to replace Amano because Nomura's designs were more adaptable to 3D graphics. He worked with the series from \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\" through \"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\". For \"Final Fantasy\u00a0IX\" character designs were handled by &lt;a href=\"Shuk%C5%8D%20Murase\"&gt;Shuk\u014d Murase&lt;/a&gt;, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Shin Nagasawa. Nomura is also the character designer of the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, \"Compilation of Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\", and \"Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy\". Other designers include Nobuyoshi Mihara and &lt;a href=\"Akihiko%20Yoshida\"&gt;Akihiko Yoshida&lt;/a&gt;. Mihara was the character designer for \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\", and Yoshida served as character designer for \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", the Square-produced \"&lt;a href=\"Vagrant%20Story\"&gt;Vagrant Story&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\".\nGraphics and technology.\nBecause of graphical limitations, the first games on the NES feature small &lt;a href=\"sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29\"&gt;sprite&lt;/a&gt; representations of the leading party members on the main world screen. Battle screens use more detailed, full versions of characters in a side-view perspective. This practice was used until \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VI\", which uses detailed versions for both screens. The NES sprites are 26\u00a0&lt;a href=\"pixel\"&gt;pixel&lt;/a&gt;s high and use a &lt;a href=\"Palette%20%28computing%29\"&gt;color palette&lt;/a&gt; of 4\u00a0colors. 6\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Film%20frame\"&gt;frames of animation&lt;/a&gt; are used to depict different character statuses like \"healthy\" and \"fatigued\". The SNES installments use updated graphics and effects, as well as higher quality audio than in previous games, but are otherwise similar to their predecessors in basic design. The SNES sprites are 2\u00a0pixels shorter, but have larger palettes and feature more animation frames: 11\u00a0colors and 40\u00a0frames respectively. The upgrade allowed designers to have characters be more detailed in appearance and express more emotions. The first game includes &lt;a href=\"non-player%20character\"&gt;non-player character&lt;/a&gt;s (NPCs) the player could interact with, but they are mostly static in-game objects. Beginning with the second game, Square used predetermined pathways for NPCs to create more dynamic scenes that include comedy and drama.\nIn 1995, Square showed an &lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20VI%23Legacy\"&gt;interactive SGI technical demonstration&lt;/a&gt; of \"Final Fantasy VI\" for the then &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fifth%20generation%29\"&gt;next generation of consoles&lt;/a&gt;. The demonstration used &lt;a href=\"Silicon%20Graphics\"&gt;Silicon Graphics&lt;/a&gt;'s prototype &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%2064\"&gt;Nintendo 64&lt;/a&gt; workstations to create 3D graphics. Fans believed the demo was of a new \"Final Fantasy\" game for the Nintendo 64 console. 1997 saw the release of \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\" for the Sony PlayStation. The switch was due to a dispute with Nintendo over its use of faster but more expensive &lt;a href=\"ROM%20cartridge\"&gt;cartridge&lt;/a&gt;s, as opposed to the slower and cheaper, but much higher capacity &lt;a href=\"Compact%20Disc\"&gt;Compact Disc&lt;/a&gt;s used on rival systems. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\" introduced &lt;a href=\"3D%20computer%20graphics\"&gt;3D graphics&lt;/a&gt; with fully &lt;a href=\"Rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29\"&gt;pre-rendered&lt;/a&gt; backgrounds. It was because of this switch to 3D that a &lt;a href=\"CD-ROM\"&gt;CD-ROM&lt;/a&gt; format was chosen over a cartridge format. The switch also led to increased production costs and a greater subdivision of the creative staff for \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\" and subsequent 3D games in the series.\nStarting with \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VIII\", the series adopted a more photo-realistic look. Like \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\", &lt;a href=\"full%20motion%20video\"&gt;full motion video&lt;/a&gt; (FMV) sequences would have video playing in the background, with the polygonal characters composited on top. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0IX\" returned to the more stylized design of earlier games in the series, although it still maintained, and in many cases slightly upgraded, most of the graphical techniques used in the previous two games. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\" was released on the PlayStation 2, and used the more powerful hardware to render graphics in real-time instead of using pre-rendered material to obtain a more dynamic look; the game features full 3D environments, rather than have 3D character models move about pre-rendered backgrounds. It is also the first \"Final Fantasy\" game to introduce &lt;a href=\"voice%20acting\"&gt;voice acting&lt;/a&gt;, occurring throughout the majority of the game, even with many minor characters. This aspect added a whole new dimension of depth to the character's reactions, emotions, and development.\nTaking a temporary divergence, \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\" used the PlayStation 2's online capabilities as an MMORPG. Initially released for the PlayStation 2 with a PC port arriving six months later, \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\" was also released on the Xbox 360 nearly four years after its original release in Japan. This was the first \"Final Fantasy\" game to use a free rotating camera. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\" was released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2 and uses only half as many polygons as \"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\", in exchange for more advanced textures and lighting. It also retains the freely rotating camera from \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\". \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XIII\" and \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XIV\" both make use of &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tools\"&gt;Crystal Tools&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"middleware\"&gt;middleware&lt;/a&gt; engine developed by Square Enix. \nMusic.\nThe \"Final Fantasy\" games feature a variety of music, and frequently reuse themes. Most of the games open with a piece called \"Prelude\", which has evolved from a simple, 2-voice &lt;a href=\"arpeggio\"&gt;arpeggio&lt;/a&gt; in the early games to a complex, melodic arrangement in recent installments. Victories in combat are often accompanied by a victory fanfare, a theme that has become one of the most recognized pieces of music in the series. The basic theme that accompanies Chocobo appearances has been rearranged in a different musical style for each installment. A piece called \"Prologue\" (and sometimes \"Final Fantasy\"), originally featured in the first game, is often played during the ending credits. Although &lt;a href=\"leitmotif\"&gt;leitmotif&lt;/a&gt;s are common in the more character-driven installments, theme music is typically reserved for main characters and recurring plot elements.\n&lt;a href=\"Nobuo%20Uematsu\"&gt;Nobuo Uematsu&lt;/a&gt; was the primary composer of the \"Final Fantasy\" series until his resignation from Square Enix in November 2004. Other notable composers who have worked on main entries in the series include &lt;a href=\"Masashi%20Hamauzu\"&gt;Masashi Hamauzu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hitoshi%20Sakimoto\"&gt;Hitoshi Sakimoto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yoko%20Shimomura\"&gt;Yoko Shimomura&lt;/a&gt;. Uematsu was allowed to create much of the music with little direction from the production staff. Sakaguchi, however, would request pieces to fit specific game scenes including battles and exploring different areas of the game world. Once a game's major scenarios were completed, Uematsu would begin writing the music based on the story, characters, and accompanying artwork. He started with a game's main theme, and developed other pieces to match its style. In creating character themes, Uematsu read the game's scenario to determine the characters' personality. He would also ask the scenario writer for more details to scenes he was unsure about. Technical limitations were prevalent in earlier games; Sakaguchi would sometimes instruct Uematsu to only use specific notes. It was not until \"Final Fantasy\u00a0IV\" on the SNES that Uematsu was able to add more subtlety to the music.\nReception.\nOverall, the \"Final Fantasy\" series has been critically acclaimed and commercially successful, though each installment has seen different levels of success. The series has seen a steady increase in total sales; it sold over 10\u00a0million software units worldwide by early 1996, more than units by 1999, more than units and nearly revenue (between adjusted for inflation) by 2001, 45\u00a0million units by August 2003, 63\u00a0million by December 2005, and 85\u00a0million by July 2008. In June 2011, Square Enix announced that the series had sold over units, and by March 2014, it had sold over 110\u00a0million units. Its high sales numbers have ranked it as one of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20best-selling%20video%20game%20franchises\"&gt;best-selling video game franchise&lt;/a&gt;s in the industry; in January 2007, the series was listed as number three, and later in July as number four. As of 2019, the series had sold over 149 million units worldwide. As of October 2021, the series has sold over 164million units worldwide.\nSeveral games within the series have become best-selling games. At the end of 2007, the seventh, eighth, and ninth best-selling RPGs were \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\", \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VIII\", and \"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\" respectively. The original \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\" has sold over 13.3\u00a0million copies worldwide, earning it the position of the best-selling \"Final Fantasy\" game. Within two days of \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VIII\"s North American release on September 9, 1999, it became the top-selling video game in the United States, a position it held for more than three weeks. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\" sold over 1.4\u00a0million Japanese units in pre-orders alone, which set a record for the fastest-selling console RPG. The MMORPG, \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\", reached over 200,000 active daily players in March 2006 and had reached over half a million subscribers by July 2007. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\" sold more than 1.7\u00a0million copies in its first week in Japan. By November 6, 2006\u2014one week after its release\u2014\"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\" had shipped approximately 1.5\u00a0million copies in North America. \"Final Fantasy XIII\" became the fastest-selling game in the franchise, and sold one million units on its first day of sale in Japan. \"Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn\", in comparison to its predecessor, was a runaway success, originally suffering from servers being overcrowded, and eventually gaining over one million unique subscribers within two months of its launch.\nThe series has received critical acclaim for the quality of its visuals and soundtracks. In 1996, \"&lt;a href=\"Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Next Generation&lt;/a&gt;\" ranked the series collectively as the 17th best game of all time, speaking very highly of its graphics, music and stories. In 1999, \"&lt;a href=\"Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Next Generation&lt;/a&gt;\" listed the \"Final Fantasy\" series as number 16 on their \"Top 50 Games of All Time\", commenting that, \"By pairing state-of-the-art technology with memorable, sometimes shamelessly melodramatic storylines, the series has successfully outlasted its competitors [...] and improved with each new installation.\" It was awarded a star on the &lt;a href=\"Walk%20of%20Game\"&gt;Walk of Game&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, making it the first franchise to win a star on the event (other winners were individual games, not franchises). WalkOfGame.com commented that the series has sought perfection as well as having been a risk taker in innovation. In 2006, &lt;a href=\"GameFAQs\"&gt;GameFAQs&lt;/a&gt; held a contest for the best video game series ever, with \"Final Fantasy\" finishing as the runner-up to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda\"&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/a&gt;\". In a 2008 public poll held by &lt;a href=\"Game%20%28retailer%29\"&gt;The Game Group plc&lt;/a&gt;, \"Final Fantasy\" was voted the best game series, with five games appearing in their \"Greatest Games of All Time\" list.\nMany \"Final Fantasy\" games have been included in various lists of top games. Several games have been listed on multiple &lt;a href=\"IGN\"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt; \"Top Games\" lists. Twelve games were listed on \"&lt;a href=\"Famitsu\"&gt;Famitsu&lt;/a&gt;\"'s 2006 \"Top 100 Favorite Games of All Time\", four of which were in the top ten, with \"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\" and \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\" coming first and second, respectively. The series holds seven &lt;a href=\"Guinness%20World%20Records\"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Guinness%20World%20Records%20Gamer%27s%20Edition\"&gt;Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition&lt;/a&gt; 2008\", which include the \"Most Games in an RPG Series\" (13 main games, seven enhanced games, and 32 spin-off games), the \"Longest Development Period\" (the production of \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\" took five years), and the \"Fastest-Selling Console RPG in a Single Day\" (\"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\"). The 2009 edition listed two games from the series among the top 50 consoles games: \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\" at number 8 and \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\" at number 20. In 2018, \"Final Fantasy VII\" was inducted as a member of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Video%20Game%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;World Video Game Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the series has garnered some criticism. \"IGN\" has commented that the menu system used by the games is a major detractor for many and is a \"significant reason why they haven't touched the series.\" The site has also heavily criticized the use of random encounters in the series' battle systems. \"IGN\" further stated the various attempts to bring the series into film and animation have either been unsuccessful, unremarkable, or did not live up to the standards of the games. In 2007, \"&lt;a href=\"Edge%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Edge&lt;/a&gt;\" criticized the series for a number of related games that include the phrase \"Final Fantasy\" in their titles, which are considered inferior to previous games. It also commented that with the departure of &lt;a href=\"Hironobu%20Sakaguchi\"&gt;Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt;, the series might be in danger of growing stale.\nSeveral individual \"Final Fantasy\" games have garnered extra attention; some for their positive reception and others for their negative reception. \"Final Fantasy VII\" topped \"&lt;a href=\"GamePro\"&gt;GamePro&lt;/a&gt;'s\" \"26 Best RPGs of All Time\" list, as well as GameFAQs \"Best Game Ever\" audience polls in 2004 and 2005. Despite the success of \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\", it is sometimes criticized as being overrated. In 2003, &lt;a href=\"GameSpy\"&gt;GameSpy&lt;/a&gt; listed it as the seventh most overrated game of all time, while IGN presented views from both sides. \"\" shipped 392,000\u00a0units in its first week of release, but received review scores that were much lower than that of other \"Final Fantasy\" games. A delayed, negative review after the Japanese release of \"Dirge of Cerberus\" from Japanese gaming magazine \"Famitsu\" hinted at a controversy between the magazine and Square Enix. Though \"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\" was praised for its visuals, the plot was criticized and the film was considered a box office bomb. \"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles\" for the &lt;a href=\"GameCube\"&gt;GameCube&lt;/a&gt; received overall positive review scores, but reviews stated that the use of &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt;s as controllers was a big detractor. The predominantly negative reception of the original version of \"Final Fantasy XIV\" caused then-president Yoichi Wada to issue an official apology during a Tokyo press conference, stating that the brand had been \"greatly damaged\" by the game's reception.\nRankings and aggregators.\nVarious video game publications have created rankings of the mainline \"Final Fantasy\" games. In the table below, the lower the number given, the better the game is in the view of the respective publication. By way of comparison, the rating provided by the review aggregator \"&lt;a href=\"Metacritic\"&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;\" is also given; in this row, higher numbers indicate better reviews.\nLegacy.\n\"Final Fantasy\" has been very influential in the history of video games and game mechanics. \"Final Fantasy IV\" is considered a milestone for the genre, introducing a dramatic storyline with a strong emphasis on character development and personal relationships. In 1992, &lt;a href=\"Nintendo\"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shigeru%20Miyamoto\"&gt;Shigeru Miyamoto&lt;/a&gt; noted the impact of \"Final Fantasy\" on &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20role-playing%20games\"&gt;Japanese role-playing games&lt;/a&gt;, stating \"Final Fantasy\"s \"interactive cinematic approach\" with an emphasis on \"presentation and graphics\" was gradually becoming \"the most common style\" of Japanese RPG at the time. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\" is credited as having the largest industry impact of the series, and with allowing console role-playing games to gain global mass-market appeal. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\" is considered to be one of the most important and influential video games of all time.\nThe series affected Square's business on several levels. The commercial failure of \"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\" resulted in hesitation and delays from Enix during merger discussions with Square. Square's decision to produce games exclusively for the Sony PlayStation\u2014a move followed by Enix's decision with the \"Dragon Quest\" series\u2014severed their relationship with Nintendo. \"Final Fantasy\" games were absent from Nintendo consoles, specifically the Nintendo 64, for seven years. Critics attribute the switch of strong third-party games like the \"Final Fantasy\" and \"Dragon Quest\" games to Sony's PlayStation, and away from the Nintendo 64, as one of the reasons behind PlayStation being the more successful of the two consoles. The release of the Nintendo GameCube, which used optical disc media, in 2001 caught the attention of Square. To produce games for the system, Square created the &lt;a href=\"Shell%20corporation\"&gt;shell company&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Game%20Designers%20Studio\"&gt;The Game Designers Studio&lt;/a&gt; and released \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Fantasy%20Crystal%20Chronicles\"&gt;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;\", which spawned its own &lt;a href=\"Media%20franchise\"&gt;metaseries&lt;/a&gt; within the main franchise. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\"s lack of an online method of subscription cancellation prompted the creation of legislation in &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; that requires internet gaming services to provide such a method to the state's residents.\nThe series' popularity has resulted in its appearance and reference in numerous facets of popular culture like anime, TV series, and &lt;a href=\"webcomic\"&gt;webcomic&lt;/a&gt;s. Music from the series has permeated into different areas of culture. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0IV\"s \"Theme of Love\" was integrated into the &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20Japan\"&gt;curriculum of Japanese school children&lt;/a&gt; and has been performed live by orchestras and metal bands. In 2003, Uematsu co-founded &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Mages\"&gt;The Black Mages&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Hard%20rock\"&gt;instrumental rock&lt;/a&gt; group independent of Square that has released albums of &lt;a href=\"arrangement\"&gt;arranged&lt;/a&gt; \"Final Fantasy\" tunes. &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20medal\"&gt;Bronze medal&lt;/a&gt;ists &lt;a href=\"Alison%20Bartosik\"&gt;Alison Bartosik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Kozlova\"&gt;Anna Kozlova&lt;/a&gt; performed their &lt;a href=\"Synchronized%20swimming%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20duet\"&gt;synchronized swimming routine at the 2004 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; to music from \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VIII\". Many of the soundtracks have also been released for sale. Numerous companion books, which normally provide in-depth game information, have been published. In Japan, they are published by Square and are called \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Square%20Enix%20companion%20books\"&gt;Ultimania&lt;/a&gt;\" books.\nThe series has inspired numerous game developers. \"&lt;a href=\"Fable%20%28video%20game%20series%29\"&gt;Fable&lt;/a&gt;\" creator &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Molyneux\"&gt;Peter Molyneux&lt;/a&gt; considers \"Final Fantasy VII\" to be the RPG that \"defined the genre\" for him. &lt;a href=\"BioWare\"&gt;BioWare&lt;/a&gt; founder &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Zeschuk\"&gt;Greg Zeschuk&lt;/a&gt; cited \"Final Fantasy VII\" as \"the first really emotionally engaging game\" he played and said it had \"a big impact\" on BioWare's work. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Witcher%203\"&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/a&gt;\" senior environmental artist Jonas Mattsson cited \"Final Fantasy\" as \"a huge influence\" and said it was \"the first RPG\" he played through. \"&lt;a href=\"Mass%20Effect\"&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/a&gt;\" art director Derek Watts cited \"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\" as a major influence on the visual design and art direction of the series. BioWare senior product manager David Silverman cited \"Final Fantasy XII\"s gambit system as an influence on the gameplay of \"\". &lt;a href=\"Ubisoft%20Toronto\"&gt;Ubisoft Toronto&lt;/a&gt; creative director Maxime Beland cited the original \"Final Fantasy\" as a major influence on him. &lt;a href=\"Media%20Molecule\"&gt;Media Molecule&lt;/a&gt;'s Constantin Jupp credited \"Final Fantasy VII\" with getting him into game design. &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Schafer\"&gt;Tim Schafer&lt;/a&gt; also cited \"Final Fantasy VII\" as one of his favourite games of all time."
