    "text": "Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic Football Club is a Scottish &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club from the town of &lt;a href=\"Bonnyrigg\"&gt;Bonnyrigg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Midlothian\"&gt;Midlothian&lt;/a&gt;. Formed in 1881 and nicknamed \"the Rose\", the team plays in the , having been promoted after winning the &lt;a href=\"East%20of%20Scotland%20Football%20League\"&gt;East of Scotland Football League&lt;/a&gt; and gaining &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20Association\"&gt;SFA&lt;/a&gt; membership in June 2019.\nTheir home ground is New Dundas Park, and they have traditionally played in red and white hoops. They have won the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt; twice, in 1966 and in 1978, as well as finishing runners-up in 1972. Their 6\u20131 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Whitburn%20Junior%20F.C.\"&gt;Whitburn&lt;/a&gt; in 1966 is a joint record margin of victory in a Scottish Junior Cup final. Bonnyrigg won the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20East%20Region%20Super%20League\"&gt;East Region Super League&lt;/a&gt; championship four times during their membership, making them the league's most successful side.\nAt a special general meeting held in March 2018, the club's members voted in favour of applying to join the &lt;a href=\"East%20of%20Scotland%20Football%20League\"&gt;East of Scotland Football League&lt;/a&gt;. Bonnyrigg were part of a larger movement of eastern junior clubs to the East of Scotland League in 2018.\nScottish Cup.\nBonnyrigg have qualified to enter the senior &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; by winning the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20East%20Region%20Super%20League\"&gt;East Superleague&lt;/a&gt; on four occasions.\nIn their first campaign in &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;2009-10&lt;/a&gt;, Bonnyrigg lost in their opening tie to &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Football%20League\"&gt;Highland League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Fraserburgh%20F.C.\"&gt;Fraserburgh&lt;/a&gt;. Better results were achieved in &lt;a href=\"2012-13%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;2012-13&lt;/a&gt;, losing to &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Scottish%20Second%20Division\"&gt;SFL Second Division&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Brechin%20City\"&gt;Brechin City&lt;/a&gt; in a third round replay after wins over &lt;a href=\"Girvan%20F.C.\"&gt;Girvan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20University%20F.C.\"&gt;Stirling University&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe third Scottish Cup adventure in &lt;a href=\"2016-17%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;2016-17&lt;/a&gt; was their most fruitful. Rose easily saw off &lt;a href=\"Glasgow%20University%20F.C.\"&gt;Glasgow University&lt;/a&gt; and then defeated &lt;a href=\"Burntisland%20Shipyard\"&gt;Burntisland Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; 14\u20130, the biggest win in the competition since 1984. This was followed by wins over Highland sides &lt;a href=\"Turriff%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Turriff United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cove%20Rangers\"&gt;Cove Rangers&lt;/a&gt;. In a big shock, Bonnyrigg then eliminated &lt;a href=\"Dumbarton%20F.C.\"&gt;Dumbarton&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Championship\"&gt;Scottish Championship&lt;/a&gt; after a replay to progress to the Fourth Round. They were drawn at home against the cup holders &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt;, with the match moved to &lt;a href=\"Tynecastle%20Stadium\"&gt;Tynecastle Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in Edinburgh to accommodate the expected number of spectators and the basic facilities at New Dundas Park. The result, an 8\u20131 defeat, was a disappointing end to the run for the team and the 5000 fans who had travelled from &lt;a href=\"Midlothian\"&gt;Midlothian&lt;/a&gt; to give their support.\nNow playing as a senior club, &lt;a href=\"2018-19%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;2018\u201319&lt;/a&gt; saw the club again qualify for the Scottish Cup after winning the East Superleague for a record fourth time. This campaign ultimately ended in disappointment, losing 2\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Deveronvale%20F.C.\"&gt;Deveronvale&lt;/a&gt; in the first round. 2018 also saw the club take part in the inaugural Shaun Woodburn Memorial Cup, established in memory of former player Woodburn, who had been killed on the previous &lt;a href=\"Hogmanay\"&gt;Hogmanay&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn June 2019, the club announced it had been accepted as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Scottish Football Association&lt;/a&gt;, which would allow them to automatically qualify for the Scottish Cup annually. In their first Scottish Cup as a licensed team, Bonnyrigg would once again go on an impressive run, defeating &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Football%20League\"&gt;Highland League&lt;/a&gt; sides &lt;a href=\"Fraserburgh%20F.C.\"&gt;Fraserburgh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buckie%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Buckie Thistle&lt;/a&gt; before dispatching &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20League%20One\"&gt;Scottish League One&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Montrose%20F.C.\"&gt;Montrose&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 at New Dundas Park, despite being a man down. In the Fourth round, Bonnyrigg would again valiantly fight against a League One team, but could not repeat their heroics and lost 0\u20131 late on to &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20F.C.\"&gt;Clyde&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntering in the Second round in &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;2020\u201321&lt;/a&gt;, Bonnyrigg would defeat fellow Lowland Leaguers &lt;a href=\"Bo%27ness%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Bo'ness United&lt;/a&gt; 5\u20132, with Lee Currie scoring a hat-trick of penalties within 10 minutes of each other. In the next round, the \"Rosey Posey\" would nearly have a cup upset for the ages, with another Currie penalty and a brilliant performance from keeper Mark Weir nearly knocking out &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Championship\"&gt;Scottish Championship&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee&lt;/a&gt; before a late equaliser sent the game to extra time. Currie again put Bonnyrigg ahead from the spot, but two goals by Dundee in the second half of extra time ended the dream.\nLowland League.\nRose were promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Lowland%20Football%20League\"&gt;Lowland League&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 after winning the &lt;a href=\"East%20of%20Scotland%20Football%20League\"&gt;East of Scotland Football League&lt;/a&gt; and gaining &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20Association\"&gt;SFA&lt;/a&gt; membership. They took the place of relegated &lt;a href=\"Whitehill%20Welfare%20F.C.\"&gt;Whitehill Welfare&lt;/a&gt;, based only two miles from Bonnyrigg in the village of &lt;a href=\"Rosewell%2C%20Midlothian\"&gt;Rosewell, Midlothian&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrent squad.\nAs of 29 January 2022\nManagers.\nThe team were managed from June 2015 by former &lt;a href=\"Berwick%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Berwick Rangers&lt;/a&gt; player and assistant manager, &lt;a href=\"Robbie%20Horn\"&gt;Robbie Horn&lt;/a&gt;. Horn resigned in August 2017 to take over the vacant managerial position at Berwick. Horn later returned as manager in November 2018.\nSeason-by-season record.\nSenior.\n\u2020 Season curtailed due to COVID-19 pandemic.\nHonours.\n&lt;a href=\"East%20of%20Scotland%20Football%20League\"&gt;East of Scotland League&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20East%20Region%20Super%20League\"&gt;SJFA East Region Super League&lt;/a&gt;"
