    "text": "Hamilton East is a suburb in central &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. The suburb's primary commercial and retail precinct is located along Grey Street. Hamilton East is characterised by villas and bungalows built early in the 20th century.\nHistory.\nHamilton East is one of Hamilton's oldest suburbs. From the 1870s until the mid-20th century, Hamilton East was sometimes known as 'Irishtown'. A significant number of the militiamen who settled there were of &lt;a href=\"Irish%20people\"&gt;Irish descent&lt;/a&gt;, and many other Irish Catholics came to live near the Catholic Church and convent.\nThe town of Hamilton East merged with &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Central\"&gt;Hamilton West&lt;/a&gt; in 1877. Many of the streets were named after famous figures of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Wars\"&gt;New Zealand Wars&lt;/a&gt;, including Governor &lt;a href=\"George%20Grey\"&gt;George Grey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ori%20people\"&gt;Maori&lt;/a&gt; chief &lt;a href=\"Wiremu%20Neera%20Te%20Awaitaia\"&gt;Te Awaitaia&lt;/a&gt;, who went by the name William Naylor/Wiremu Neera when he converted to Christianity. Evidence of planning for the centre of the village can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"village%20green\"&gt;village green&lt;/a&gt; concept of Steele Park and the planting of English trees along Grey Street. Hamilton East is one of the few suburbs of Hamilton to have a street &lt;a href=\"grid%20plan\"&gt;grid plan&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany of the parks in Hamilton East, including &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Gardens\"&gt;Hamilton Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, are located on the original &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Town%20Belt\"&gt;Hamilton Town Belt&lt;/a&gt; that runs along the eastern and southern border of Hamilton East. Just to the north of the Gardens, Flynn Park housed an ammunition factory from 1942 to 1946. It is the most southerly of the parks in the original Belt and on the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%2C%20New%20Zealand%23Road\"&gt;Wairere Drive&lt;/a&gt; extension to &lt;a href=\"Peacocke%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Peacocke&lt;/a&gt;.\nUntil February 1971 the Royal Hotel stood on the corner of Grey Street and Cook Street, now occupied by Eastside Tavern and Liquorland. The first Royal Hotel was opened on the southwest corner of Grey and Cook Streets in July 1865, by Lewis Bassiere Harris, of the 4th Waikato Militia Regiment. The hotel burnt down in 1894 and was rebuilt later that year. Many early meetings were held in the hotel, including those of &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20City%20Council%2C%20New%20Zealand%23History\"&gt;Kirikiriroa Road Board&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2000 the suburb was extended over a former part of &lt;a href=\"Ruakura%23Ruakura%20Agriculture%20Research%20Centre\"&gt;Ruakura&lt;/a&gt; Experimental Farm, by Grasshopper East Ltd. and Chedworth Properties Ltd adding 321 houses at Sherwood Park.\u00a0 Although the streets are named with a &lt;a href=\"Sherwood%20Forest\"&gt;Sherwood Forest&lt;/a&gt; theme, it required a campaign to preserve a &lt;a href=\"Windbreak\"&gt;shelter belt&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sequoioideae\"&gt;redwood&lt;/a&gt; trees from the development.\nFeatures of Hamilton East.\nHamilton Gardens.\nHamilton Gardens, a 58 hectare public park, is located along the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Waikato%20River\"&gt;Waikato River&lt;/a&gt;. Hamilton Gardens is the most popular visitor attraction in the region with about 1.3 million visitors each year, nearly half of them being tourists. They were developed from the 1980s in stages, with paradise, productive, cultivar and landscape collections. The much-praised paradise collection includes a Chinese scholar's garden, an English flower garden, a Japanese garden of contemplation, an American modernist garden, an Italian Renaissance garden and an Indian char bagh garden.\nHayes Paddock.\nHayes Paddock, an enclave in Hamilton East developed between 1939 and 1945, was planned and built according to the philosophies and ideals of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Labour%20Government%20of%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;First Labour Government&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20City%20Movement\"&gt;Garden City Movement&lt;/a&gt;. It includes curved street patterns, open plan garden layouts, low density development, and the provision of walkways and reserves. Hayes Paddock contains over 200 classic &lt;a href=\"state%20housing\"&gt;state houses&lt;/a&gt; built along seven streets named mostly after New Zealand &lt;a href=\"Governor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;governors general&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese governors general were notable and influential men of their time. Macfarlane Street, the only street not named after a governor general, was named after James MacFarlane, a partner in the Auckland company of Henderson and MacFarlane. The area that makes up Hayes Paddock was named after William Hayes who farmed the area, under lease, from 1903 to 1925.\nThanks to Hamilton heritage enthusiasts and local council processes, Hayes Paddock has received protection in the city's district plan. The purpose of this protection was to safeguard the unique and special heritage of the Hayes Paddock area.\nAn extensive chronology of key events from 1978, when Hayes paddock was first identified as having heritage value, to the May 2006 Council Report leading to the council decision, can be found in the Variation to Hamilton City District Plan version 2001.\nA final hearing of proposed changes was held in July 2008 and on 24 September 2008 a full Council confirmed the changes, subject to some amendments.\nGraham Island.\nGraham Island is a small islet of about , separated from the main river bank south of Hayes Paddock by about of shallow water. It rises to about above the river, with a low cliff facing the main channel. Most of the island is covered in &lt;a href=\"Rubus%20idaeus\"&gt;raspberry&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"alder\"&gt;alder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acacia%20dealbata\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acacia%20longifolia\"&gt;golden wattle&lt;/a&gt; as the main trees. Te Moutere O Koipikau &lt;a href=\"P%C4%81\"&gt;P\u0101&lt;/a&gt; once stood on the island.\nWellington Beach.\nA beach was part of the 1945 plan for developing the reserve. In 2013 it was voted one of the country's best beaches.\nInstitute de Notre Dames des Missions.\nThe \"Institute de Notre Dames des Missions\" was a &lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20architecture\"&gt;Romanesque&lt;/a&gt; style convent and heritage site on Clyde St. Most of the building was demolished in 2017, but the chapel was restored and is a &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20New%20Zealand%23New%20Zealand%20Heritage%20List%20/%20R%C4%81rangi%20K%C5%8Drero\"&gt;Category 2&lt;/a&gt; listed building.\nCathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Hamilton.\nThe modern &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary%2C%20Hamilton\"&gt;Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt; was dedicated in 1980 and refurbished in 2008. It is the Cathedral of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Hamilton%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Hamilton Catholic Diocese&lt;/a&gt;.\nMemorial Park.\nHamilton's first militia settlers landed on this site in 1864. The park and cenotaph were created in memory of &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; soldiers on what was previously called &lt;a href=\"K%C5%8Dwhai\"&gt;Kowhai&lt;/a&gt; Bank. The park was further developed with a &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; memorial as well as a &lt;a href=\"Spitfire\"&gt;Spitfire&lt;/a&gt; air-force memorial.\nPaddle steamer Rangiriri.\nOn the riverbank is the hulk of the &lt;a href=\"Early%20naval%20vessels%20of%20New%20Zealand%23River%20boats\"&gt;paddle steamer Rangiriri&lt;/a&gt;. She was prefabricated at the &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Nicol%20Russell\"&gt;P.N. Russell &amp; Co&lt;/a&gt;. foundry in Sydney and assembled at Port Waikato. The first of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20the%20Waikato%23Aftermath\"&gt;military settlers&lt;/a&gt; landed from the Rangiriri at Hamilton on 24 August 1864. She ran aground in 1889, was lifted from the riverbed in 1981, pulled further up in 1982 and restored in 2010. Her length was , breadth and speed .\nRiver cruises.\nFrom 1985 \"MV Waipa Delta\" provided excursions from the Park until 2009. She was replaced by a smaller boat until the pontoon at the Park was removed in 2013. The former &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Bay%20/%20Mohua\"&gt;Golden Bay&lt;/a&gt; vessel, \"Cynthia Dew,\" ran 4 days a week on the river from 2012 and now runs 5 days a week from a floating pontoon.\nParana Park.\nParana Park is about and forms a northern extension of Memorial Park. It was left to the city in 1929 in the will of George Parr (hence the name Parana), who was the son of the &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Hamilton%2C%20New%20Zealand%23List%20of%20Mayors%20of%20Hamilton\"&gt;1893 Mayor&lt;/a&gt;. In 1936, a paddling pool and playground were built and &lt;a href=\"Wallaby\"&gt;wallabies&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Common%20brushtail%20possum%20in%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;possum&lt;/a&gt; introduced. The playground was rebuilt in 2012. There are several notable trees and structures in the Park. In Gibbons Creek a barrier was removed and 3 fish passes built to help migratory fish overcome weirs.\nSteele Park.\nAt the centre of Hamilton East is \"Steele Park\", named for militia officer William Steele. It was originally called Sydney Square, after the New South Wales city where members of the 4th Waikato militia enlisted. The oaks around its perimeter were planted in 1889, the silver jubilee of the arrival of militia settlers. Historically used for social gatherings for settlers, today it continues to be an important venue for sport, cultural and social events. \nOddfellows Hall.\nThe Loyal Hamilton Lodge of the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Order%20of%20Odd%20Fellows\"&gt;Independent Order of Oddfellows&lt;/a&gt; was built by Edward Pearson in 1874 on the perimeter of Steele Park. It is now a &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20New%20Zealand%23New%20Zealand%20Heritage%20List%20/%20R%C4%81rangi%20K%C5%8Drero\"&gt;Historic Place Category 2&lt;/a&gt; building housing the Cook bar. From about 1884 it was used as a factory by the family who had built it a decade earlier. Pearson's sandsoap was advertised from 1882, took out a patent in 1884, started a factory in Sydney in 1892 and later moved production to &lt;a href=\"Penrose%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Penrose&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to 1934 some of their sand came from what is now Edgecumbe Park in &lt;a href=\"Whitiora\"&gt;Whitiora&lt;/a&gt;. Edward Pearson also built a nearby Presbyterian church, which was demolished in 1957.\nGalloway Park.\nA former redoubt, Galloway Park is now an active sports park utilised for a variety of summer and winter sports. In summer, it is primarily used for &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; and in winter, it is primarily used for &lt;a href=\"Association%20Football\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreenslade House.\n\"Greenslade House\" is a distinctive Edwardian house, with a turret, at 1 Wellington Street. It was built between 1910\u20131912 for a prominent Hamilton businessman and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;New Zealand Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; MP, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Greenslade\"&gt;Henry Greenslade&lt;/a&gt;. The architect, John W Warren, also helped design the &lt;a href=\"Waikato%20Hospital\"&gt;Waikato Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. The Pearson family (see Oddfellows Hall above) lived in the house from 1934. It remains a private residence, was given &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20New%20Zealand%23New%20Zealand%20Heritage%20List%20/%20R%C4%81rangi%20K%C5%8Drero\"&gt;Historic Place Category 1&lt;/a&gt; listing on 21 September 1989, is a large 490 with 5 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms and has been sold many times since restoration in the 1970s.\nBeale Cottage.\nThe tiny cottage on the corner of Beale and Grey Streets is Hamilton's oldest remaining house, named after the 4th Mayor of Hamilton, &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Charles%20Beale\"&gt;Bernard Charles Beale&lt;/a&gt;. He designed and built the simple cottage in 1872 using locally-grown kauri and kahikatea. Soon after, he added several more rooms. One room in the house was used as a surgery.\nNga Uri o Hinetuparimaunga.\nLocated at the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Gardens\"&gt;Hamilton Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, \"Nga Uri o Hinetuparimaunga\" is a sculpture created by two internationally renowned artists, sculptor Chris Booth and &lt;a href=\"Diggeress%20Te%20Kanawa\"&gt;Diggeress Te Kanawa&lt;/a&gt;. Their design proposal was chosen in a competition to which top New Zealand artists had been invited to submit designs. The woven Hinuera stone cloak sculpture honours natural creative processes.\nFormer Waikato County Council office.\nThe former &lt;a href=\"Waikato%20County\"&gt;Waikato County Council&lt;/a&gt; office at 455 Grey Street, on the corner of Clyde Street, opened in 1910. It has not been greatly altered and is now used by a travel agent. It is protected by a Category B listing in Hamilton City's District Plan. It was replaced by new offices to the rear of it, which had a foundation stone dated 4 February 1971 and were first used for a meeting on 21 March 1972. The old building was leased to the Ministry of Agriculture. After 1989 the new building was used by &lt;a href=\"Waikato%20District%20Council\"&gt;Waikato District Council&lt;/a&gt; and then by Hill Laboratories until 2017. Since 2020 it has been renovated as Hills Village apartments.\nDemographics.\nHamilton East, comprising the statistical areas of Hamilton East Village, Greensboro, Hamilton East Cook and Hamilton East, had a population of 12,996 at the &lt;a href=\"2018%20New%20Zealand%20census\"&gt;2018 New Zealand census&lt;/a&gt;, an increase of 1,389 people (12.0%) since the &lt;a href=\"2013%20New%20Zealand%20census\"&gt;2013 census&lt;/a&gt;, and an increase of 2,283 people (21.3%) since the &lt;a href=\"2006%20New%20Zealand%20census\"&gt;2006 census&lt;/a&gt;.
