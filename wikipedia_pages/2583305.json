    "text": "Veronica chamaedrys, the germander speedwell, bird's-eye speedwell, or cat's eyes, is a &lt;a href=\"herbaceous%20plant\"&gt;herbaceous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; species of &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; in the plantain family &lt;a href=\"Plantaginaceae\"&gt;Plantaginaceae&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Veronica chamaedrys\" can grow to tall, but is frequently shorter, with stems that are hairy only along two opposite sides. The leaves are in opposite pairs, triangular and crenate, sessile or with short petioles. The &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are deep &lt;a href=\"blue\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Floral%20symmetry%23zygomorphic\"&gt;zygomorphic&lt;/a&gt; (bilaterally-symmetrical) four-lobed corolla, wide. The capsules are wider than they are long.\nThe blossoms of this plant wilt very quickly upon picking, which has given it the ironic name \"M\u00e4nnertreu\", or \"men's faithfulness\" in German.\n\"Veronica chamaedrys\" is a common, hardy turf so-called weed when it invades turf and lawns. It creeps along the ground, spreading by sending down roots at the stem nodes. It is propagated both by seed and stem fragments. Leaves may defoliate in the summer and winter but the stems will grow again next season. Unlike at least five other common speedwell species, such as corn speedwell (\"Veronica arvensis\"), the &lt;a href=\"Leaf%23Arrangement%20on%20the%20stem\"&gt;leaves are opposite&lt;/a&gt; \"both\" on the upper and lower parts of the plant. See the \"&lt;a href=\"Veronica%20%28plant%29%23Weed\"&gt;Veronica&lt;/a&gt;\" for special weed control considerations.\nDistribution.\nThis species is native to &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; west of the Ural Mountains. It is found on other continents as an &lt;a href=\"introduced%20species\"&gt;introduced species&lt;/a&gt;.\nUses.\n\"Veronica chamaedrys\" has been used in traditional Austrian herbal medicine internally (as tea) for disorders of the nervous system, respiratory tract, cardiovascular system, and metabolism. In 18th century Britain, the plant had the reputation of being a cure for &lt;a href=\"gout\"&gt;gout&lt;/a&gt; as well as being popular for making tea, the latter being so prevalent that the plant was nearly eradicated from London during the 18th century."
