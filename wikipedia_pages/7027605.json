    "text": "Scott Howie (born 4 January 1972) is a Scottish former professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; goalkeeper. Having played professionally in the English and Scottish football leagues, he currently plays for English non-league side &lt;a href=\"Wroxham%20F.C.\"&gt;Wroxham&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowie played for local non-league side Ferguslie United before joining &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20F.C.\"&gt;Clyde&lt;/a&gt; in 1991, continuing to study for his Business Degree. He graduated with a BA from &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Strathclyde\"&gt;Strathclyde Business School&lt;/a&gt; in July 1994. Howie was capped by &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20under-21%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland under-21s&lt;/a&gt; while with Clyde, making his debut against &lt;a href=\"Malta%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; and also appearing for Clyde later the same day. He also helped Clyde to the Scottish Second Division Championship.\nIn August 1993 he was sold to &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Norwich City&lt;/a&gt; for a fee of \u00a3300,000, but made just two first team appearances, both while regular goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Gunn\"&gt;Bryan Gunn&lt;/a&gt; was suspended. He was however a substitute for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; games against &lt;a href=\"Vitesse%20Arnhem\"&gt;Vitesse Arnhem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith first team opportunities limited, Howie moved to &lt;a href=\"Motherwell%20F.C.\"&gt;Motherwell&lt;/a&gt; in October 1994, again costing \u00a3300,000. His form with Motherwell resulted in call-ups to the full Scotland team, although he never appeared at full international level. With Motherwell suffering financial problems, Howie refused to sign a new contract, restricting him from playing for a few months.\nHe joined &lt;a href=\"Coventry%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Coventry City&lt;/a&gt; on loan in January 1998 and finally left Motherwell to join &lt;a href=\"Reading%20F.C.\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt; for a fee of \u00a330,000 on transfer deadline day in March 1998. Reading were relegated at the end of the season, but Howie remained with them until being released at the end of the 2000\u20132001 season.\nIn July 2001 he joined &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol Rovers&lt;/a&gt; and was their player of the year the following season. Despite this, he was released in May 2003 at the end of the following season. He had a successful trial with &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Exeter City&lt;/a&gt; in July 2003, but failed to agree personal terms.\nHe joined &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Shrewsbury Town&lt;/a&gt; in August 2003 and played in the &lt;a href=\"Conference%20National%20Playoff%20Final%202004\"&gt;final of the 2004 Conference play-offs&lt;/a&gt;. The match went to penalties, and Howie saved three of the spot-kicks as The Shrews won promotion back to &lt;a href=\"the%20Football%20League\"&gt;the Football League&lt;/a&gt; at the first attempt. At the end of the 2004\u201305 season, Howie was one of only two players, the other being &lt;a href=\"Stuart%20Whitehead\"&gt;Stuart Whitehead&lt;/a&gt;, to be offered a new contract by Shrewsbury manager &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Peters%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Gary Peters&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was subsequently released and was on trial with &lt;a href=\"Boston%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Boston United&lt;/a&gt; in July 2005.\nHowever, he joined Conference side &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Cambridge United&lt;/a&gt; in August 2005, where he played under the management of his former Norwich team-mate &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Newman%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Rob Newman&lt;/a&gt;. He retired in the May 2006, with the &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20Evening%20News\"&gt;Cambridge Evening News&lt;/a&gt; reporting on 10 May 2006 that he had retired to concentrate on his tax consultancy business.\nOn retiring he agreed to make himself available as cover for Cambridge's goalkeepers. In April 2007 he joined &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Lynn%20F.C.\"&gt;King's Lynn&lt;/a&gt;. He was cover for regular King's Lynn keeper &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Crichton\"&gt;Paul Crichton&lt;/a&gt; the following season, but played as first choice goalkeeper during the 2008\u201309 season.\nIn June 2009 Howie joined &lt;a href=\"Wroxham%20F.C.\"&gt;Wroxham&lt;/a&gt;, playing at Wembley for them as they lost 6\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Whitley%20Bay%20F.C.\"&gt;Whitley Bay&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Vase\"&gt;FA Vase&lt;/a&gt; Final in May 2010.\nScott is currently a coach at Cringleford Junior Football Club, and has played for Wroxham alongside this coaching role\nHonours.\nClyde\nShrewsbury Town\nKing's Lynn"
