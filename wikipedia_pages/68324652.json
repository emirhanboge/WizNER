Running, swimming, cycling, soccer, basketball were some of the sports that gave him pleasure. When he was around 7 or 8 years old, he practiced swimming a few times per week. He did not enjoy it much, was not successful in competitions, but his parents persuaded him to continue. In the meantime, he continued with other sports.\nWhen he was around 11 or 12 years old, his parents, who ran as a hobby, took the young Bence Bics\u00e1k to a race. The race gave him enjoyment.\nA local coach, Istv\u00e1n G\u00f3cz\u00e1n, of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//zalatriatlon.hu/index.php/bemutatkozunk/\"&gt;Triathlon Association&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zalaegerszeg\"&gt;Zalaegerszeg&lt;/a&gt; contacted Bics\u00e1k and asked him to participate in an &lt;a href=\"aquathlon\"&gt;aquathlon&lt;/a&gt; competition. Aquathlon is a race combining swimming and running. Bence did well in the swim and ran his way up to finish first. To his surprise, Bence had earned a gold medal. He had never won a running race before. The race was the spark that set him on an exceptionally long and challenging path to eventually becoming a top-10 triathlete. When he was 15 years old, Bics\u00e1k decided to take up the sport of &lt;a href=\"triathlon\"&gt;triathlon&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Istv\u00e1n G\u00f3cz\u00e1n asked the young Bence Bics\u00e1k at what age he wanted to reach his top performance level, physically and mentally. Bence Bics\u00e1k's answer was \"between 25 and 28\".\nPersonal life.\nBence Bics\u00e1k has one sibling that is about two years younger.

His sister Flora would participate a few months later in two events at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Summer%20Youth%20Olympics\"&gt;2014 Nanjing Youth Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;. Flora Bics\u00e1k finished 17th. \nIt is noteworthy that sibling support and rivalry between triathletes occur frequently. For example, &lt;a href=\"Jonny%20Brownlee\"&gt;Jonathan Brownlee&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//triathlon.org/results/result/2012_london_olympic_games/8597\"&gt;Olympic Bronze&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//triathlon.org/results/result/2016_rio_de_janeiro_olympic_games/305290\"&gt;Silver medal&lt;/a&gt; winner) physically helped his brother &lt;a href=\"Alistair%20Brownlee\"&gt;Alistair&lt;/a&gt; over the finish line during the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.bbc.com/sport/triathlon/37402716\"&gt;dramatic finish&lt;/a&gt; of the 2016 &lt;a href=\"Cozumel\"&gt;Cozumel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Triathlon\"&gt;Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; World series.

Many decades earlier, both of his parents had graduated from a university of P\u00e9cs. He moved from &lt;a href=\"Zalaegerszeg\"&gt;Zalaegerszeg&lt;/a&gt; to the city of &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A9cs\"&gt;P\u00e9cs&lt;/a&gt;.

As department head and coach, Szil\u00e1rd and many of his dedicated staff members provided Bence Bics\u00e1k and nearly forty other Hungarian triathletes with excellent training conditions and significant support. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.psnzrt.hu/\"&gt;PSN zrt&lt;/a&gt;. has 14 sports departments, and significant sports facilities.\n2015 was the first year that Bence Bics\u00e1k competed as an adult and within the U23 (Under 23 years old) &lt;a href=\"triathlon\"&gt;triathlon&lt;/a&gt; category.

For Bics\u00e1k, the significantly greater triathlon distances coupled with a much higher level of competition resulted in a much more challenging year. \nFor 2015, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Triathlon\"&gt;World Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; rankings database indicates that Bence Bics\u00e1k competed in 11 triathlon events and had three podium finishes, two Silvers and one Bronze.

The preceding was coupled with daily swims and bicycling three times per week.\nIn 2016, the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//europe.triathlon.org/federations/federation/hungarian_triathlon_federation\"&gt;Hungarian Triathlon Union&lt;/a&gt; awarded the then 20-year-old Bence Bics\u00e1k for being the best U23 athlete in 2015.\nBics\u00e1k's performance helped the recently created triathlon department in &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A9cs\"&gt;P\u00e9cs&lt;/a&gt; rank fifth out of 92 Hungarian associations. \nBics\u00e1k and fellow triathlete and &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A9cs\"&gt;P\u00e9cs&lt;/a&gt; teammate No\u00e9mi S\u00e1rszegi qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2020 Tokyo Olympic&lt;/a&gt; training program. The 2020 Olympic training program began after the 2&lt;a href=\"2016%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;016 Rio Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;. It provided specialized training camps and competitions to help develop potential &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20at%20the%20Olympics\"&gt;Hungarian Olympians&lt;/a&gt;. A key objective for Bics\u00e1k was preparation by 2018 for the two-year &lt;a href=\"Triathlon%20at%20the%202020%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Qualification\"&gt;Olympic qualification process for the 2020 Games&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//triathlon.org/about/download_file/world_triathlon_individual_olympic_qualification_ranking_criteria_updated\"&gt;two-year qualification process&lt;/a&gt;, over many races, triathletes accumulate points. The top 55 males and 55 females with the highest points rankings become qualified for the Games.\nIn 2016, races that are not ITU (&lt;a href=\"World%20Triathlon\"&gt;International Triathlon Union&lt;/a&gt;) events provided Bics\u00e1k with additional opportunities to compete, enjoy the sport and improve.

Among the other training activities, and compared to Hungary's climate in the winter, the more favorable environment in the Canary Islands made it possible for Bics\u00e1k to bicycle 800 kilometers in two weeks.\nAfter participating in a two-week training camp in &lt;a href=\"Cyprus\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; on March 26, 2017, Bence Bics\u00e1k placed 4th at the 2017 Gran Canaria &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.triathlon.org/events/event/2017_las_palmas_etu_triathlon_european_cup\"&gt;ETU Triathlon European Cup&lt;/a&gt; Elite event.

He exited the water 12th, reached the breakaway bike group in the first 10 km of the bike segment, and powered during his run to a 4th place finish for his first competition of 2017.\nOn April 22, 2017, Bence Bics\u00e1k finished won gold at the Hungarian Sprint &lt;a href=\"Duathlon\"&gt;Duathlon&lt;/a&gt; National Championships held in &lt;a href=\"Balatonbogl%C3%A1r\"&gt;Balatonboglar&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn June 04, 2017, Bence Bics\u00e1k finished 9th in the &lt;a href=\"Cagliari\"&gt;Cagliari&lt;/a&gt; ITU Triathlon World Cup Elite event. The event marked the second time that Bics\u00e1k finished in the top ten in a World Cup, and as a result, he ranked 66th place in the world ranking.\nOn July 22, 2017, Bence Bics\u00e1k wins his first World Triathlon Cup at the 2017 &lt;a href=\"Tisza%C3%BAjv%C3%A1ros\"&gt;Tiszaujvaros&lt;/a&gt; ITU Triathlon World Cup Elite event. Bics\u00e1k won Gold by arriving at the finish line 15 seconds before the three-time Olympian &lt;a href=\"Dmitry%20Polyanski\"&gt;Dmitry Polyanski&lt;/a&gt; and thus earning for Hungary the second-ever Gold medal in a &lt;a href=\"ITU%20Triathlon%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Triathlon World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. is the only other Hungarian triathlete to ever win a World Triathlon Cup. Two weeks before the World Cup event, Bics\u00e1k finished 7th at the &lt;a href=\"European%20Athletics%20U20%20Championships\"&gt;European Athletics U23 Championships&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Bics\u00e1k finished 3rd in the &lt;a href=\"10%2C000%20metres\"&gt;10,000-meter&lt;/a&gt; Adult National Championships.\nOn August 05, 2017, Bence Bics\u00e1k won gold at the &lt;a href=\"Velence\"&gt;Velence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.triathlon.org/events/event/2017_velence_etu_u23_triathlon_european_championships\"&gt;ETU Triathlon U23 European Championships&lt;/a&gt; event. After the European Championship event, Bics\u00e1k held 47th place in the world rankings.\nIn a September 12, 2017, publication, Bence Bics\u00e1k stated that being a triathlete comes with \"quite a bit of pain.\" However, he added that gradually increasing his workload to multiple training sessions per day over many years helped him adapt. Thankful of the support from the University of P\u00e9cs, professors, and friends, Bence Bics\u00e1k stated that he had only one more session/internship to complete his degree. Bence Bics\u00e1k emphasized that his dream was not just to qualify for the 2020 Olympics but to \"leave with a good outcome.\" Furthermore, he added that his \"ultimate goal is to become one of the world's best triathletes.\" Bence Bics\u00e1k is majoring in Business Administration and Management at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20P%C3%A9cs\"&gt;University of P\u00e9cs&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"https%3A//ktk.pte.hu/en/education/bachelor-programs/bsc-business-administration-and-management\"&gt;Faculty of Business and Economics&lt;/a&gt;.\n2018: Competing at world-level.\nFor 2018, the World Triathlon rankings database indicates that Bence Bics\u00e1k competed in 13 &lt;a href=\"triathlon\"&gt;triathlon&lt;/a&gt; events and won two Golds and a Bronze. Overall, he placed within the top 10 in 62% of the races. In 2018, he competed in &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2018, the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//europe.triathlon.org/federations/federation/hungarian_triathlon_federation\"&gt;Hungarian Triathlon Union&lt;/a&gt; awarded the then 22-year-old Bence Bics\u00e1k for being the best U23 &lt;a href=\"triathlon\"&gt;triathlon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"duathlon\"&gt;duathlon&lt;/a&gt; athlete in 2017. Bence Bics\u00e1k's coach, Szil\u00e1rd T\u00f3th, was acknowledged as Coach of the Year in the same ceremony. In 2017, Szil\u00e1rd T\u00f3th was the head of the &lt;a href=\"triathlon\"&gt;triathlon&lt;/a&gt; department in &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A9cs\"&gt;P\u00e9cs&lt;/a&gt;. The department consisted of a staff of about fifty people. By bicycling 200-300 km and running 60-70 km per week, coach T\u00f3th actively participated in the triathletes' training. \nOn May 12, 2018, at the ITU &lt;a href=\"World%20Triathlon%20Series\"&gt;World Triathlon Series&lt;/a&gt; (WTS) Yokohama Elite event, Bence Bics\u00e1k finished 5th. The WTS is where the best in the world compete; this Bics\u00e1k's second participation in the WTS. After the race, the then two-time World Champion and two-time Olympian &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Mola\"&gt;Mario Mola&lt;/a&gt; shook Bics\u00e1k's hand to acknowledge Bics\u00e1k notable accomplishment. The &lt;a href=\"Yokohama\"&gt;Yokohama&lt;/a&gt; WTS was the first of forty triathlon Olympic Qualification events for the 2020 Games. The top 12 results determine the Olympic Qualification rankings. ITU Triathlon World Cup events have a maximum of 75 competitors. However, ITU Triathlon World Series (WTS) has only 55 competitors, and many top-10 in the rankings tend to be present.\nOn May 21, 2018, after two events, Bence Bics\u00e1k was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.triathlon.org/uploads/docs/2020_Tokio_QualificationM180521.pdf\"&gt;1st in the ITU Individual Olympic Qualification Ranking&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Lausanne\"&gt;Lausanne&lt;/a&gt; ITU Triathlon World Cup where he finished 4th, on August 18, 2018, Bence Bics\u00e1k was 7th in the ITU Individual Olympic Qualification Ranking. A week later, after the ITU World Triathlon &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; Elite event, he ranked 6th.\nOn September 14, 2018, at the ITU &lt;a href=\"https%3A//goldcoast.triathlon.org/\"&gt;World Triathlon Grand Final Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; U23 event, Bence Bics\u00e1k won Bronze sharing the podium with &lt;a href=\"Tayler%20Reid\"&gt;Tayler Reid&lt;/a&gt; and Samuel Dickenson.\nReflecting on the 2018 triathlon competition year, Bence Bics\u00e1k stated, \"These results are noteworthy because no Hungarian triathlete has made (it) to the top 10 so far, and this was only my first year to race in &lt;a href=\"World%20Triathlon%20Series\"&gt;world-level competitions&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIn October 2018, Bence Bics\u00e1k stated that he trains in all three sports (swim, bike run) daily. Furthermore, during a race, that he maintains a pulse of about 190 beats per minute for about two hours. His coach Szil\u00e1rd T\u00f3th referred to Bence Bics\u00e1k as \"the fine-tuned sports machine.\"\nOlympic Qualification ranking aside, by November 2018, Bence Bics\u00e1k was 18th in the Triathlon World Rankings. \n2018 being his first year competing at a world-class level, Bence Bics\u00e1k reported that everyone was kind and personally welcomed by most of the eminent athletes. He added that he would increase his training intensity but take a balanced and gradual approach to reach the top physical and mental form required to be at the Olympics. He indicated that he was making good progress and that he was confident. At the end of 2018, his first year competing in the top-tier World Triathlon Series (WTS), Bence Bics\u00e1k ranked 23rd. \nOne of Bics\u00e1k's stated goals for 2019 was to secure his Olympic Qualification ranking by participating in as many &lt;a href=\"World%20Triathlon%20Series\"&gt;World Triathlon Series&lt;/a&gt; as possible. Another goal was to enjoy and love what he is doing and put as much effort into his &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20P%C3%A9cs\"&gt;university&lt;/a&gt; studies.\n2019.\nFor 2019, the World Triathlon rankings database indicates that Bence Bics\u00e1k competed in 11 triathlon events and won two Bronze. Overall, he placed within the top 10 in 64% of the races.\nOn April 27, 2019, at the MS Amlin World Triathlon Bermuda Elite event, Bics\u00e1k finished 7th. His race result propelled him to 11th place in the World Triathlon Series Rankings, overtaking a two-time Olympian in the process. Post-race, Bics\u00e1k's performance captured the attention of the then &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Javier%20G%C3%B3mez%20Noya\"&gt;five-time world champion triathlete legend&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn May 18, 2019, at the ITU World Triathlon Yokohama Elite event, Bics\u00e1k finished 3rd. Bics\u00e1k overtook the five-time world champion and Olympic Silver medalist &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Javier%20G%C3%B3mez%20Noya\"&gt;Javier Gomez&lt;/a&gt; by 12 seconds to earn the Bronze. Furthermore, Bics\u00e1k shared the podium with the #1 ranked triathlete &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Luis\"&gt;Vincent Luis&lt;/a&gt; and Olympic medalist &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Schoeman\"&gt;Henri Schoeman&lt;/a&gt;. After one hour, forty-three minutes, and 26 seconds of racing, Bics\u00e1k was a mere five seconds from the Gold and 1 second from the Silver. The #1 ranked triathlete &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Luis\"&gt;Vincent Luis&lt;/a&gt; was the first to congratulate Bics\u00e1k and told him that he knew that the moment would come. The result of the race placed Bics\u00e1k at 6th place in the Olympic Qualification rankings and 12th in the World rankings.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//olimpia.hu/bicsak-bence-tortenelmi-bronzerme-a-triatlon-vilagkupa-sorozatban-\"&gt;[Bence Bic\u00e1k's historic bronze medal in the triathlon World Cup series&lt;/a&gt;]\nOn May 27, 2019, Rich\u00e1rd L\u00e1szl\u00f3, Director of &lt;a href=\"Toyota\"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; Central Europe, distributed a &lt;a href=\"Toyota%20C-HR\"&gt;Toyota C-HR&lt;/a&gt; hybrid to Bence Bics\u00e1k and twelve other sponsored Olympic caliber athletes. Toyota was a Platinum Sponsor of the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;Hungarian Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; and also directly sponsored athletes like Bics\u00e1k. &lt;a href=\"Kriszti%C3%A1n%20Kulcs%C3%A1r\"&gt;Kriszti\u00e1n Kulcs\u00e1r&lt;/a&gt;, President of the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;Hungarian Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt;, was present at the distribution ceremony.\nOn July 06, 2019, there was a multiple cyclist crash during the Hamburg Wasser World Triathlon Elite event. As a result, an injured Bence Bics\u00e1k needed transportation to a hospital. Unfortunately for Bics\u00e1k, the crash of bicycles ahead of him, while in a peloton formation, made the collision for him and others unavoidable. At a fast speed, he violently came into contact with a metal crowd barrier. He was ejected into the air as his bicycle came to a sudden and complete stop. \nTo make matters worse, it took quite a long time for the ambulance to reach Bics\u00e1k due to a parked tractor-trailer blocking access. Unfortunately, the accident in &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; made it impossible for him and the Hungarian team to compete in the Triathlon team-relay race on the following day. Although Bics\u00e1k had been in multiple crashes during his long career, this was the first time that he needed transportation to a hospital. Fortunately, there were no fractures or significant tears. Before the race in Hamburg, Bics\u00e1k had finished top-10 in all but one WTS event. After Hamburg, Bics\u00e1k was 16th in the World Rankings, 9th in the WTS rankings, and 10th in the Olympic Qualification rankings. \nBecause of his injuries, Bics\u00e1k training regimen needed adjustment, but he was hopeful regarding the remaining triathlon competition season. Following the Hamburg event, Bics\u00e1k was supposed to be at the World Championship event in Edmonton, Canada. Unfortunately, due to the recent stitches on his body, he would not compete there. In the weeks that followed, his knee was healing quickly. He participated in a high-altitude training camp in the USA. In his own words, \"I was in a pretty bad place in terms of endurance, but even more so mentally, yet I still held onto my goals.\" \nOn August 16, 2019, the important &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.triathlon.org/events/event/2019_tokyo_itu_world_olympic_qualification_event\"&gt;Tokyo ITU World Triathlon Olympic Qualification event&lt;/a&gt; took place. The event was simultaneously a test of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2020 Olympic venue&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Triathlon%20at%20the%202020%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;triathlon Olympic&lt;/a&gt; Qualification event.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; event occurred only 41 days after Bics\u00e1k's significant crash and injury in &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;. There was intense heat, near 100% humidity, and powerful winds due to an incoming &lt;a href=\"typhoon\"&gt;typhoon&lt;/a&gt;. Due to extreme climate conditions, the organizers initially planned to shorten the race, but this did not occur. Consequently, the organizers maintained the total &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Distance%20Triathlon\"&gt;Olympic distance&lt;/a&gt; (1.5 km swim, 40 km bike, and 10 km run).\nAfter a challenging swim, Bics\u00e1k caught up to the lead peloton but was involved in a mass bike crash. He recovered from the crash and, due to his remarkable running performance, managed to finish 7th. Bics\u00e1k would later state that \"\u2026 only a podium finish would have made me happy! It would have been more realistic to just give up at that point considering the mental state I was in.\" Two days later, the Hungarian mixed-relay team, of which Bics\u00e1k is a member, finished 9th. Despite the physical injuries sustained in Hamburg 41 days prior, the physical and mental fortitude displayed by Bence Bics\u00e1k at the Tokyo ITU World &lt;a href=\"Triathlon%20at%20the%202020%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Triathlon Olympic&lt;/a&gt; Qualification event secured his top-10 Olympic Qualification ranking. Being 9th in the rankings was remarkable, in that Bics\u00e1k was at a disadvantage compared to rivals because he had to miss out on the race in &lt;a href=\"Edmonton\"&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt; due to injury. \n&lt;a href=\"Endurance%20training\"&gt;Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20training\"&gt;endurance sport&lt;/a&gt; that always takes a tremendous physical and mental toll at the elite level. For the recovering Bics\u00e1k, the toll in August of 2019 was significantly greater than usual. Before the ITU World Triathlon Grand Final, Bics\u00e1k stated, \"My Achilles tendon is aching, and there is barely any skin left on my heels. Even putting my race shoes on represents a challenge\". He also stated, \"I am additionally hoping for plain sailing at this (Grand Final) race \u2013 without any unfortunate events, and where following a smooth start, I won't have to fight my way back from the bottom. I have had a share of both of these situations recently.\" [August 31, 2019]. \nHowever, on August 31, 2019, at the Grand Final in &lt;a href=\"Lausanne\"&gt;Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;, Bence Bics\u00e1k finished 29th. Regarding the race, Bics\u00e1k later stated, \"This race was the most painful. I wished I could have disappeared, to have become invisible after finishing 29th. I placed 13th overall, but there was still another event that kept creeping into my mind. I had my heart set on racing at the World Cup event in &lt;a href=\"Banyoles\"&gt;Banyoles&lt;/a&gt;\"\nOn September 07, 2019, at the Banyoles ITU Triathlon World Cup event, and in a reversal of fortune from the Lausanne event two weeks prior, Bence Bics\u00e1k closed the triathlon racing season by finishing 3rd. Bence Bics\u00e1k's comeback performance in Banyoles was as \"astonishing.\" Bics\u00e1k was 17 seconds away from the Silver obtained by the 5 -time World Champing &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Mola\"&gt;Mario Mola&lt;/a&gt; and 19 seconds away from the Gold won by then-current World Champion &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Luis\"&gt;Vincent Luis&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn October 17, 2019, Bence Bics\u00e1k was credited as providing Hungarian triathlon with increased momentum due to his numerous top-10 finishes in the top-tier &lt;a href=\"World%20Triathlon%20Series\"&gt;World Triathlon Series&lt;/a&gt; (WTS).\n2019 was Bence Bics\u00e1k's most challenging year of his life. There were high expectations and a great deal of pressure on the 23-year-old athlete. After the 2019 &lt;a href=\"Yokohama\"&gt;Yokohama&lt;/a&gt; event that had propelled him to 4th in the rankings, he stated, \"I suddenly felt as though I was capable of anything.\" However, later, in the &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"World%20Triathlon%20Series\"&gt;WTS&lt;/a&gt; event, he went from the best shape of his life to a race-canceling injury. To his credit, by the year-end, Bics\u00e1k found the physical and mental fortitude to end on a triumph, albeit a painful one.\nOn December 30, 2019, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Triathlon%20Union\"&gt;International Triathlon Union&lt;/a&gt; (ITU) officially ranked Bence Bics\u00e1k as having the #&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.triathlon.org/uploads/docs/olympic_qualification_.pdf\"&gt;9 position in the Individual Olympic Qualification Ranking for the 2020 Tokyo Games&lt;/a&gt;.\n2020.\nAt the beginning of 2020, Bics\u00e1k's 5784.78 points, 9th in the World Triathlon Individual Olympic Qualification rankings made him technically assured of qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Tokyo%20Olympics\"&gt;2020 Tokyo Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. However, Bics\u00e1k expressed that all athletes who make it to the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic games&lt;/a&gt; stand a &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20medal\"&gt;medal&lt;/a&gt; chance regardless of how high their Olympic Qualification ranking is. \nOn January 15, 2020, a ceremony confirmed the establishment of a sponsorship agreement between the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//europe.triathlon.org/federations/federation/hungarian_triathlon_federation\"&gt;Hungarian Triathlon Union&lt;/a&gt; and global corporate giant &lt;a href=\"E.ON\"&gt;E.ON&lt;/a&gt;. During the same ceremony, in recognition of Bence Bics\u00e1k's unprecedented triathlon results, E.ON announced that Bics\u00e1k was sponsored, and expected to have a top-10 finish at the Tokyo Olympic Games. Bics\u00e1k stated, \"My primary goal is to become the world's best triathlete.\". Historically, the best Hungarian result in an Olympics was 30th by &lt;a href=\"Csaba%20Kuttor\"&gt;Csaba Kuttor&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Sydney%20Olympics%20Games\"&gt;2000 Sydney Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"World%20Health%20Organization\"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) declared &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"pandemic\"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; on March 11, 2020.\nOn March 24, 2020, in a joint statement, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20Shinzo%20Abe\"&gt;Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"International%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; (IOC) president &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Bach\"&gt;Thomas Bach&lt;/a&gt; officially announced the postponement of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Tokyo%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;2020 Tokyo Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; to a date no later than 2021.\nEver since he was a child, the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; had been one of Bence Bics\u00e1k's biggest dreams. The impact of the postponement on Bence Bics\u00e1k and other Olympic caliber athletes was understandably and in numerous ways extremely disruptive and significant.\nBics\u00e1k had been training \"like crazy,\" intending to reach his peak performance at the 2020 Olympics. However, &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; restrictions closed or severely limited access to the training venues essential to keeping an &lt;a href=\"elite%20athlete\"&gt;elite athlete&lt;/a&gt; at their best performance level. In a &lt;a href=\"triathlon\"&gt;triathlon&lt;/a&gt;, an athlete must balance training across all three sports. For Bics\u00e1k, who is physically smaller than most &lt;a href=\"Elite%20athlete\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; triathletes, not having access to a swimming facility was one of his most significant concerns.\nThe &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; severely curtailed international travel, and most elite-level triathletes could not get to world-class triathlon events. Consequently, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Triathlon\"&gt;World Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; organization postponed or canceled most &lt;a href=\"triathlon\"&gt;triathlon&lt;/a&gt; events.\nDue to not knowing when the international competition season could begin, elite triathletes competed primarily domestically when they could, at amateur events, and under COVID-19 restrictions. Bics\u00e1k's first such event was the eXtremeMan 2020 amateur event near Kaposv\u00e1r. The Olympic distance event was Bics\u00e1k's first race in ten months. He came in first beating in the process two of his fellow National Team members. However, Bics\u00e1k's goal was not to defeat his competitors but to \"promote each other's training\" and determine his mental state. \nIn the summer of 2020, despite trying to find races to compete and due to the pandemic, Bence Bics\u00e1k found himself free for the first time in years. However, not being used to having free time and being inactive came with its challenges. Bics\u00e1k and his coach took three weeks off. Bics\u00e1k went fishing, stand-up-paddled, read books, played the guitar, and spent time with family and friends. \nFor all elite athletes, the harsh reality is that there are no suitable substitutes to live competition. By August 05, 2020, Bence Bics\u00e1k competed in 8 domestic races over five consecutive weekends. The most meaningful event was the Hungarian National Triathlon Championships, where he won Gold. \nAt the top-10 elite level, triathlons are often won or lost by small nuances. When competing together, top-10 elite athletes need to make numerous and minute adjustments to their tactics during a race. When a top-10 athlete competes below their usual level, it's their raw power and ability that tends to get expressed the most. Unfortunately, such races leave less opportunity to experience and refine the tactics required to win at an Olympic level.\nBy August 25, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cancellation of 7 of the 8 World Triathlon Series (WTS) events. The only WTS event that remained possible was in Hamburg. The World Triathlon Executive Board decided that the singular Hamburg event would crown the 2020 WTS Champions. In theory, qualified triathletes from around the world could participate, and the number of allowed competitors, usually 55, was increased to 65. However, significant travel restrictions did prevent many of the usual competitors from attending.\nTriathlon is a sport that has a lot of expenses associated with it. Unfortunately, for top-tier triathletes like Bics\u00e1k, another significant consequence of the cancellation of seven of the eight WTS events was the considerable decrease in opportunities to earn &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.triathlon.org/uploads/docs/World_Triathlon_Prize_Money_Breakdown.pdf\"&gt;prize money&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn September 05, 2020, at the Hamburg Wasser World Triathlon Elite event, Bence Bics\u00e1k finished 14th. He was \"somewhat frustrated.\" With regards to the event, Bics\u00e1k stated what follows. \"The race in Hamburg was a significant one not only in terms of the coming year but also my career as a whole because this is the only means to achieve mental training.\" \"This was the kind of racing that I missed. It is entirely different to cycle in a peloton of 60 bikers versus 4 or 5, like it was the case at home.\" \nOn September 05, 2020, at the Hamburg ITU Triathlon Mixed Relay World Championships event, the Hungarian team that Bics\u00e1k was a member of finished 12th.\nOn September 13, 2020, at the Karlovy Vary ITU Triathlon World Cup Elite event and recovering from a minor hit by a motorcycle cameraperson, Bence Bics\u00e1k finished 5th. Unfortunately for Bics\u00e1k, the motorcycle made a turn while Bics\u00e1k was attempting to pass. Bics\u00e1k was slightly hurt, but \"quite a few contestants\" passed him when he stopped to go around the motorcycle. In 2020, this was the only World Cup where Bics\u00e1k could compete. At the Karlovy Vary event, Bics\u00e1k's national teammate &lt;a href=\"https%3A//triathlon.org/athletes/profile/56153/mark_devay\"&gt;M\u00e1rk D\u00e9vay&lt;/a&gt; was injured in a bike crash and required hospitalization during the race.\n2021: The &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; continues to disrupt competition.\nOn March 20, 2021, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; and four other governing bodies announced that due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, overseas spectators would not be allowed to the &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2020%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn March 25, 2021, the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Olympic%20torch%20relays\"&gt;Olympic torch relay&lt;/a&gt; started in &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. It signaled that the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; would likely begin 121 days later. The torch relay gave hope to thousands of &lt;a href=\"elite%20athletes\"&gt;elite athletes&lt;/a&gt;, Bics\u00e1k among them.\nIn a &lt;a href=\"rebranding\"&gt;rebranding&lt;/a&gt; effort, on October 1, 2020, the International Triathlon Union became &lt;a href=\"World%20Triathlon\"&gt;World Triathlon&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, and for historical clarity, ITU events before October 1, 2020, remain identified as ITU. Similarly, on March 4, 2021, the &lt;a href=\"ITU%20World%20Triathlon%20Series\"&gt;ITU World Triathlon Series&lt;/a&gt; (WTS) became World Triathlon Championship Series (WTCS). Consequently, and for historical clarity, WTS events before 2021 remain identified as WTS.\nAt the start of 2021, the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID pandemic&lt;/a&gt; continued to disrupt significantly the competition schedule set by &lt;a href=\"World%20Triathlon\"&gt;World Triathlon&lt;/a&gt;. Uncertainty of the first &lt;a href=\"https%3A//chengdu.triathlon.org/\"&gt;WTCS race in Chengdu&lt;/a&gt;, the moving of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//montreal.triathlon.org/\"&gt;Montreal event&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//abudhabi.triathlon.org/\"&gt;Adu Dhabi even&lt;/a&gt; t dates made travel and logistics planning a challenge. \nOn April 22, 2020, &lt;a href=\"World%20Triathlon\"&gt;World Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the schedule for the 2021 &lt;a href=\"https%3A//wtcs.triathlon.org/\"&gt;World Triathlon Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; (WTCS). The first event was for the triathlon in &lt;a href=\"Chengdu\"&gt;Chengdu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, scheduled for May 1st and 2nd. Bics\u00e1k previously competed in Chengdu events in 2018 and 2019. Unfortunately, the 2020, the Chengdu event was canceled due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. However, as of April 24, 2021, a mere eight days before the 2021 Chengdu WTCS event, the actual start date remained to be confirmed. \nIn a parallel triathlon competition series, the pandemic also played havoc with the 2021 &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.triathlon.org/search%23q%3DWorld%2520Triathlon%2520Cup%2520\"&gt;Triathlon World Cup&lt;/a&gt; schedule. The cancelation of the 2021 &lt;a href=\"Osaka\"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt; Triathlon World Cup and the changed date of the &lt;a href=\"Huatulco\"&gt;Huatulco&lt;/a&gt; Triathlon World Cup signaled that the 2021 World Cup season might continue to have significant disruptions. \nDue to COVID-19, the pre-Olympic 2021 triathlon season was exceptionally challenging for many elite triathletes trying to regain their peak performance. In four out of five 2021 pre-Olympic game events, Bence Bics\u00e1k finished well below his typical performance levels. However, on 13 June 2021, Bence Bics\u00e1k achieved a gold medal finish at the Grand-Prix triathlon event in Dunkirk.\nAs a member of the Hungarian 2020 &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20triathlon\"&gt;Olympic Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; team, Bence Bics\u00e1k competed in the men's individual event at the &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Olympics%202020\"&gt;2020 Tokyo Olympic Summer Games&lt;/a&gt;. He placed 7th out of 51 Olympians that started the race.\nEndorsements.\nAs a top-10 triathlete, Bence Bics\u00e1k has been able to obtain sponsorship from significant global corporate entities.
