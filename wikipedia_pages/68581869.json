    "text": "The Abbey of Saint-Joseph de Clairval () is a &lt;a href=\"Benedictines\"&gt;Benedictine&lt;/a&gt; abbey located in &lt;a href=\"Flavigny-sur-Ozerain\"&gt;Flavigny-sur-Ozerain&lt;/a&gt;, in the C\u00f4te d'Or department. \nFounded in 1972, the abbey has no direct relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Flavigny%20Abbey\"&gt;Flavigny Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, which has not been occupied by Benedictine monks since the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. \nBelonging to the &lt;a href=\"Olivetans\"&gt;Olivetan&lt;/a&gt; branch, the monks wear the black &lt;a href=\"Bure%20%28cloth%29\"&gt;bure&lt;/a&gt; and the white collar.\nHistory.\nSaint-Joseph de Clairval was founded in 1972 by Dom Augustin-Marie Joly in Clairval, Switzerland.\nThe abbey moved to Flavigny in 1976, since the owner wanting to recover the buildings in Clairval. \nIn memory of this period, the community kept the name of Clairval.\nThe premises used by the abbey in Flavigny were originally built in 1700 as the private mansion of the Marquis de Souhey, governor of Flavigny.\nThey had been occupied by the Diocesan Petit S\u00e9minaire.\nAt first the monks of Flavigny celebrated the &lt;a href=\"Tridentine%20Mass\"&gt;Tridentine Mass&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20V\"&gt;Pope Pius V&lt;/a&gt; and Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Lefebvre\"&gt;Marcel Lefebvre&lt;/a&gt; had ordained for their priests. \nHowever, the community never had canonical links with the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Saint%20Pius%20X\"&gt;Society of Saint Pius X&lt;/a&gt;. \nFrom the mid-1980s, rumors announcing the &lt;a href=\"%C3%89c%C3%B4ne%20consecrations\"&gt;ordination of four bishops&lt;/a&gt; without the agreement of Rome gradually led the community to move away from the Lefebvriste movement.\nContacts were established with the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Dijon\"&gt;Diocese of Dijon&lt;/a&gt; and the community was recognized as a monastery under diocesan law on 2 February 1988.\nAt the request of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Holy See&lt;/a&gt;, in 1992 the monastery was erected into an abbey and the founder, Dom Augustin Marie Joly, became abbot.\nAs of 2010 there were about fifty monks.\nIn June 2021 it was announced that the abbey had founded a priory which would take over the premises of &lt;a href=\"Solignac%20Abbey\"&gt;Solignac Abbey&lt;/a&gt;.\nStarting in the fall of that year about ten monks would settle in Solignac.\nIt would take about twelve years for the foundation to be recognized as final. \nLiturgy.\nAt the request of the bishop of Dijon, the conventual mass is today celebrated according to the ordinary form of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Rite\"&gt;Roman Rite&lt;/a&gt;, in Latin and ad Orientem (in truth in the South-East). The conventual mass being not concelebrated, the monk priests celebrate every day the low mass, mostly in the &lt;a href=\"Tridentine%20Mass\"&gt;Tridentine&lt;/a&gt; form of the Roman Rite.\nAll the offices (including the Liturgy of the Hours) are &lt;a href=\"Gregorian%20chant\"&gt;sung in Gregorian&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius and individual visits.\nSince its foundation and faithful to its own spirit, the abbey has regularly offered retreats for men where they undertake the &lt;a href=\"Spiritual%20Exercises%20of%20Ignatius%20of%20Loyola\"&gt;Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola&lt;/a&gt;. \nThese retreats generally take place over five days, according to the method of Father &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20de%20Paula%20Vallet\"&gt;Francisco de Paula Vallet&lt;/a&gt; (1883\u20131947).\nMen can also make individual visits in the abbey outside of retreat time. \nThey then participate in the liturgical life of the community and can benefit from spiritual accompaniment.\nSpiritual letter.\nEvery five weeks, the abbey writes a spiritual letter in six languages. \nIt can be received free of charge by e-mail or post by registering on the abbey's website.\nIt is generally a life of a saint.\nOther activities.\nThe monks create liturgical artwork including iconography and sculpture.\nFor income, the abbey gift shop, Traditions Monastiques, offers:\nReligious neighbors.\nThe Saint-Cur\u00e9-d'Ars seminary, one of the seminaries of the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Saint%20Pius%20X\"&gt;Society of Saint Pius X&lt;/a&gt;, is located in Flavigny on the other side of the village."
