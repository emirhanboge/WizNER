    "text": "The Ervel\u00e4 railway station (, ) is a station located in the village of &lt;a href=\"Ervel%C3%A4\"&gt;Ervel\u00e4&lt;/a&gt; in the town of &lt;a href=\"Salo%2C%20Finland\"&gt;Salo&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Perni%C3%B6\"&gt;Perni\u00f6&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. It is located along the &lt;a href=\"Helsinki%E2%80%93Turku%20railway\"&gt;Helsinki\u2013Turku railway&lt;/a&gt;, and is currently only used as a &lt;a href=\"passing%20loop\"&gt;passing loop&lt;/a&gt;; the nearest station with passenger services is &lt;a href=\"Salo%20railway%20station\"&gt;Salo&lt;/a&gt; in the north.\nHistory.\nFirst station.\nErvel\u00e4 was opened as a \"laituri\" (a manned halt, translating to \"platform\") on 16 October 1909, from the initiative of a local retail &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt; first made in 1907. While the initially proposed locations for the station were kilometer markers 120 and 123, it was initially placed further east from the latter option, at from &lt;a href=\"Helsinki%20railway%20station\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, it became apparent that the station's location could not accommodate a &lt;a href=\"rail%20yard\"&gt;rail yard&lt;/a&gt;, and so in 1919, the station was moved further west to the approximate location of kilometer marker 123, as had been proposed before. This also prompted the moving of the station building to the northern side of the railway, from its south.\nPassenger services in Ervel\u00e4 were discontinued on 22 May 1977, and the only remaining &lt;a href=\"railroad%20switch\"&gt;switch&lt;/a&gt; was dismantled in November 1981, which prompted the cessation of the operating point on 1 January 1982. The station and its former siding were however briefly used during trackwork operations in 1987.\nAs a passing loop.\nAfter further trackwork on the Helsinki\u2013Turku line starting from 1989, Ervel\u00e4 was reopened as a &lt;a href=\"passing%20loop\"&gt;passing loop&lt;/a&gt; in 1992, approximately to the east from the site of the old Ervel\u00e4 station. The location of the line shifted notably in the vicinity of the old station, and thus the station building now lies further away from the railway than it did before.\nArchitecture.\nThe station building in Ervel\u00e4 was constructed in 1909, and is representative of &lt;a href=\"Jugendstil\"&gt;Jugendstil&lt;/a&gt; in its architecture. In 2006, the old station premises were purchased from the Railway Administration by a private buyer, who has since worked on renovating and restoring the station building."
