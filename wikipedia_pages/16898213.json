    "text": "The tourism industry in Angola is based on the country's natural environment, including its rivers, waterfalls and coastline. Angola's tourism industry is relatively new, as much of the country was ravaged during the post-colonial &lt;a href=\"Angolan%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; which ended in 2002. Unlike most countries in the region, which generally give US, EU, and many other citizens a visa on arrival or require no visa at all, Angola has complicated visa requirements (official letter of invitation, documents concerning purpose of travel, copy of travel itinerary, proof of funds, etc., all of which are sent back to Luanda for approval). This procedure towards visitors places the country at a disadvantage in the competitive &lt;a href=\"international%20tourism\"&gt;international tourism&lt;/a&gt; market.\nVisitor attractions.\nCameia National Park.\n&lt;a href=\"Cameia%20National%20Park\"&gt;Cameia National Park&lt;/a&gt; is a visitor attraction in Angola. It is a &lt;a href=\"national%20park\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Moxico%20%28province%29\"&gt;Moxico&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href=\"Angola\"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;, located at about 1100 m above sea level. It shares its name with the nearby municipality of &lt;a href=\"Cameia\"&gt;Cameia&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Cameia\"&gt;Cameia&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Luacano\"&gt;Luacano&lt;/a&gt; road forms the northern boundary of the park with the Chifumage River forming the southern portion of the eastern boundary and the Lumege and Luena rivers the south-western boundary. Much of the park consists of seasonally inundated plains that form part of the Zambezi river basin, with the northern half of the park draining into the Chifumage river. There are also extensive miombo woodlands, similar to those in the Zambezi basin of western Zambia. The park is a sample of nature not occurring elsewhere in Angola. Two lakes, Lago Cameia and &lt;a href=\"Lago%20Dilolo\"&gt;Lago Dilolo&lt;/a&gt; (the largest lake in Angola) lie outside the park boundaries and both have extensive &lt;a href=\"reedbed\"&gt;reedbed&lt;/a&gt;s and grassy swamps that are rich in aquatic birds.\nCangandala National Park.\n&lt;a href=\"Cangandala%20National%20Park\"&gt;Cangandala National Park&lt;/a&gt; is another visitor attraction in Angola. It is the smallest National Park in the country and is situated in the &lt;a href=\"Malanje%20%28province%29\"&gt;Malanje province&lt;/a&gt;. It is situated between the &lt;a href=\"Cuije\"&gt;Cuije river&lt;/a&gt; and 2 unnamed territories of the &lt;a href=\"Cuanza%20River\"&gt;Cuanza River&lt;/a&gt;, with the towns of &lt;a href=\"Culamagia\"&gt;Culamagia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Techongolola\"&gt;Techongolola&lt;/a&gt; on the edges of the park. The park was created in 1963 while Angola was still under &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; colony.\nIona National Park.\nIona National Park, located in Namibe Province, is another popular tourist destination. It is about from the city of &lt;a href=\"Mo%C3%A7%C3%A2medes\"&gt;Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes&lt;/a&gt; and, at , the largest in the country. Before the &lt;a href=\"Angolan%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Angolan Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, Iona was an \"animal paradise, rich in big game\". However, as is true for most Angolan national parks, illegal poaching and the destruction of infrastructure have caused considerable damage to the once rich park. The park is also known for unique flora and incredible rock formations.\nMupa National Park.\nMupa National Park in the southwestern &lt;a href=\"Cunene%20%28province%29\"&gt;Cunene province&lt;/a&gt; was proclaimed a National Park on 26 December 1964 while the country was still a Portuguese colony. The park is significant for its expected wide (though generally unstudied) &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;avifauna&lt;/a&gt;. Many Angolans reside within the park, which, along with &lt;a href=\"nomad\"&gt;nomad&lt;/a&gt;ic pastoralists and &lt;a href=\"mineral\"&gt;mineral&lt;/a&gt; prospecting threatens to destroy the park's birdlife. According to one article, \"Even though the park was initially proclaimed to protect the &lt;a href=\"giraffe\"&gt;giraffe&lt;/a&gt; sub-species, \"&lt;a href=\"Angolan%20giraffe\"&gt;Giraffa camelopardalis angolensis&lt;/a&gt;\", by 1974 none were left because the morphology of the White Giraffe leaves it particularly vulnerable to landmines left over from Angola's civil war compared to other &lt;a href=\"giraffe\"&gt;giraffe&lt;/a&gt; sub-species. Other mammals which occurred, include &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leopard\"&gt;leopard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"African%20wild%20dog\"&gt;wild dog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spotted%20hyena\"&gt;spotted hyena&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCoastline.\nAngola borders the Atlantic ocean and has 1,650\u00a0km of coastline."
