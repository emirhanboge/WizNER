    "text": "The USAFE Warrior Preparation Center is located at Einsiedlerhof Air Station, Germany (near Ramstein Air Base). it provides combat readiness training for &lt;a href=\"USAFE\"&gt;USAFE&lt;/a&gt; forces with advanced simulation software.\nMission.\nThe center's mission is to provide combat readiness training for &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Air%20Forces%20Europe\"&gt;United States Air Forces Europe&lt;/a&gt; (USAFE) forces. The WPC supports Tier 1 through Tier 4 training (Strategic through Tactical) via the Distributed Training Center connecting with other bases throughout the world. These missions are accomplished with advanced simulation software.\nHistory.\nThe USAFE Warrior Preparation Center was founded in 1983 by Colonel \"Moody\" Suter, who also developed the Air Force's &lt;a href=\"Red%20Flag%20exercise\"&gt;Red Flag exercise&lt;/a&gt;s, at Einsiedlerhof Air Station, Germany. Originally designed to train USAFE forces, in 2009 it expanded to include training for &lt;a href=\"Air%20Forces%20Africa\"&gt;Air Forces Africa&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 2017, the center added the &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Terminal%20Attack%20Controller\"&gt;Joint Terminal Attack Controller&lt;/a&gt; (JTAC) domed simulator to its simulator systems. The simulator is designed to support training for JTACs in the performance of terminal control, &lt;a href=\"terminal%20guidance\"&gt;terminal guidance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"close%20air%20support\"&gt;close air support&lt;/a&gt;, and joint fires operations training. The simulator uses multiple 4K projectors to display a 270 degree field of view for the JTACs. They use emulated binoculars, night vision devices, and M4 carbine during their training. The center plans to use the simulator in future large scale exercises including Spartan Eagle Exercises that include airmen stationed stateside."
