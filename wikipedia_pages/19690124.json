    "text": "\"Alla barnen\" (&lt;a href=\"Swedish%20language\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; for \"All the children\") is a type of humorous poetic form, told primarily by schoolchildren in &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt;, although it originated in &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=\"meme\"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt; was most popular in the early 1990s, as they were very macabre which at the time was highly unusual but their popularity has since diminished. The &lt;a href=\"comic%20book\"&gt;comic book&lt;/a&gt; writing duo &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A5ns%20Gahrton\"&gt;M\u00e5ns Gahrton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Unenge\"&gt;Johan Unenge&lt;/a&gt; has created several books based on the form, all with a title starting with \"Alla barnen\", the later ones in the series have discarded the more macabre jokes to be more child-friendly.\nForm.\nCompared to a &lt;a href=\"limerick%20%28poetry%29\"&gt;limerick&lt;/a&gt; Alla Barnen is more free form with no set meter. They consist of three parts and these are:\nAnd the name must &lt;a href=\"rhyme\"&gt;rhyme&lt;/a&gt; with the end of the sentence."
