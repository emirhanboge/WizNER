It also operates a &lt;a href=\"cellular%20telephone\"&gt;cellular telephone&lt;/a&gt; service on the &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Mobile%20Phone%20System\"&gt;AMPS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Groupe%20Sp%C3%A9cial%20Mobile\"&gt;GSM&lt;/a&gt; platforms.\nTelephones \u2013 main lines in use:\n1,100 (800 land line, 300 fixed wireless) (2003)\nTelephones \u2013 mobile cellular:\nundisclosed (excludes 300 fixed wireless) (2003)\nTelephones \u2013 GSM mobile cellular:\nundisclosed (2011)\nTelephone system:\n&lt;br&gt;\"domestic:\"\nsingle-line telephone system connects all villages on island\n&lt;br&gt;\"international:\"\nprovided by Telecom Niue (&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20country%20calling%20codes\"&gt;IDD code&lt;/a&gt;: 683)\nRadio.\nRadio broadcast stations:\nAM 1, FM 1, shortwave 0 (1998)\nRadios:\n1,000 (1997)\nTelevision broadcast stations:\n1 (1997)\nTelevisions:\nNA\nNewspapers.\nNiue has only one printed newspaper, the \"&lt;a href=\"Niue%20Star\"&gt;Niue Star&lt;/a&gt;\", founded in 1993. Until 2002, the Auckland-based &lt;a href=\"Pasifika%20Times\"&gt;Pasifika Times&lt;/a&gt; was also circulated in Niue.\nInternet service.\n&lt;a href=\"Niue\"&gt;Niue&lt;/a&gt; has free Internet service through the efforts of the Internet Users Society Niue, established 1999. However users need to pay NZD$25 to a local IT company to register the &lt;a href=\"MAC%20address\"&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; of their &lt;a href=\"WiFi\"&gt;WiFi&lt;/a&gt; card before being able to log into this WiFi network.\nAlternatively, where ADSL is available, users can have connections through Telecom Niue's Internet Services located at Alofi through their island-wide distributed wireline.\n.nu Internet domain.\nThe &lt;a href=\".nu\"&gt;.nu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"TLD\"&gt;TLD&lt;/a&gt; is assigned to Niue.\nNiue, through an outside company, registers &lt;a href=\"Internet\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"top-level%20domain\"&gt;domain names&lt;/a&gt;, so most .nu &lt;a href=\"web%20address\"&gt;web address&lt;/a&gt;es are not actually located in Niue. They are commonly used by Danish, Dutch and Swedish websites, because in those languages 'nu' means \u201c&lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3Anow\"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;\u201d.\nNiue was the first country in the world to plan on offering free nationwide &lt;a href=\"WiFi\"&gt;WiFi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internet%20access\"&gt;internet access&lt;/a&gt;, using the funds provided by the domain registrations. 95% of Niueans now have internet access at home, work or through the schools, making it the country with the highest per capita internet penetration in the world."
