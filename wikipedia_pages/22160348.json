    "title": "Lord Mayor of Liverpool",
    "text": "The office of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mayor\"&gt;Lord Mayor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; has existed in one form or another since the foundation of Liverpool as a borough by the Royal Charter of &lt;a href=\"John%2C%20King%20of%20England\"&gt;King John&lt;/a&gt; in 1207, simply being referred to as the Mayor of Liverpool. The position is now a mostly ceremonial role. The current Lord Mayor of Liverpool is Mary Rasmussen, who has held the post since May 2021.\nHistory.\nThe most prominent Mayors were the Stanleys of Knowsley, of which Sir Thomas Stanley (son of the 3rd Earl) and the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 16th and 18th &lt;a href=\"Earls%20of%20Derby\"&gt;Earls of Derby&lt;/a&gt; have held this office since ancient times. The Molyneuxs of Sefton have also held this office on numerous occasions over the centuries: Sir Richard Molyneux, his grandson Sir Richard Molyneux Baronet, the 1st Viscount Molyneux and the 7th &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Sefton\"&gt;Earl of Sefton&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Liverpool was granted city status in 1880 it was deemed necessary for the \"second city of the Empire\" to have a Lord Mayor. The city was granted a Lord Mayoralty on 3 August 1893 through letters patent making it the equal third oldest office of this kind in England along with Manchester. and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Durning%20Holt\"&gt;Robert Durning Holt&lt;/a&gt; became the first Lord Mayor of Liverpool.\nFor a substantial period of time the Lord Mayor of Liverpool used the prefix of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Right%20Honourable\"&gt;The Right Honourable&lt;/a&gt;\" as did the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London\"&gt;Lord Mayor of London&lt;/a&gt;. Sir &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Woods\"&gt;Albert Woods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garter%20Principal%20King%20of%20Arms\"&gt;Garter Principal King of Arms&lt;/a&gt; was of the opinion that this honorific should be enabled, due to the importance of Liverpool as a city second only to London. When Sir &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Scott-Gatty\"&gt;Alfred Scott-Gatty&lt;/a&gt; succeeded as King of Arms, he expressed the view that his predecessor had made an error. This changed nothing, however, and the city continued to use the prefix up until a Parliamentary statement in 1927. From then on the Lord Mayor was styled \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Right%20Worshipful\"&gt;The Right Worshipful&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWilliam Wallace Currie was the first \"Mayor of Liverpool\" under the &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20Corporations%20Act%201835\"&gt;Municipal Corporations Act 1835&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1983, the Labour controlled Council replaced the office of Lord Mayor with that of Chairman. The Lord Mayoralty was formally restored in 1990.\nThe traditional office of the Lord Mayor of Liverpool differs from that of the new directly elected &lt;a href=\"Directly%20elected%20mayor%20of%20Liverpool\"&gt;Mayor of Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, an executive position created in 2012 when the functions of the former Lord Mayor were divided. The Lord Mayor's role is now primarily ceremonial in order to represent the city at civic functions and engagements, promote the city nationally and internationally and support local charities and community groups."
