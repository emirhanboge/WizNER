    "text": "The Communist Party of Turkey (, TKP) is a &lt;a href=\"communist%20party\"&gt;communist party&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded as the Socialist Power Party (, S\u0130P) on 16 August 1993. In 2001, the party changed its name to the Communist Party of Turkey (TKP) and took over the historical legacy of the TKP.\nHistory.\nAfter the 12 September Coup &amp; Gelenek era.\nThe TKP that has been founded in 2001 has its roots in 1978. In that year a faction called Sosyalist \u0130ktidar (Socialist Power) has voiced concerns about the main political line of the &lt;a href=\"Workers%20Party%20of%20Turkey\"&gt;Workers Party of Turkey&lt;/a&gt; (\"T\u00fcrkiye \u0130\u015f\u00e7i Partisi\" or T\u0130P). The group claimed that the party's activities were not consistent with the programme of a revolutionary party, defending socialist revolution. The group headed by &lt;a href=\"Yal%C3%A7%C4%B1n%20K%C3%BC%C3%A7%C3%BCk\"&gt;Yal\u00e7\u0131n K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Metin%20%C3%87ulhao%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Metin \u00c7ulhao\u011flu&lt;/a&gt; argued that due to oppressive terror atmosphere in the country the party gave in to unification policy within the left wing thus losing the perspective of taking power. The group has printed the \"Sosyalist \u0130ktidar\" magazine during 1978-80 but it was not effective. After the coup of 12 September 1980 the activities of the group almost stopped like nearly all other party or groups.\nAfter the coup, the group aimed to consolidate its cadres and its theoretical base. However, in 1982 a division has occurred within the group between Yal\u00e7\u0131n K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck supporters and Metin \u00c7ulhao\u011flu followers. Yal\u00e7\u0131n K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck and his group published \"Toplumsal Kurtulu\u015f\" while Metin \u00c7ulhao\u011flu and his group published \"Gelenek\" magazine after his release from jail in 1986. TKP stems from Gelenek magazine organisation. Gelenek defined the left in three categories as; orthodox, revolutionary democratic and new. From this perspective it defended the orthodox left view and criticized the ongoing glasnost and perestroika processes in the Soviet Union.\nIn this period the Gelenek group announced that in the upcoming 1987 General Elections it will not support any intra-system political party. It had worked with other left wing groups to campaign for independent members for parliament. During this era Gelenek group entered into negotiations for building a left wing party where all groups may be brought together but this process had failed. After the collapse of these talks, Gelenek group had formed Socialist Turkey Party (\"Sosyalist T\u00fcrkiye Partisi\") STP on 6 November 1992 in Ankara. The Political Bureau of the party were made up of seven people: Ali \u00d6nder \u00d6nde\u015f (President), &lt;a href=\"Kemal%20Okuyan\"&gt;Kemal Okuyan&lt;/a&gt; (Vice-President), &lt;a href=\"Metin%20%C3%87ulhao%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Metin \u00c7ulhao\u011flu&lt;/a&gt;, S\u00fcleyman Baba, U\u011fur \u00d6zdemir, I\u015f\u0131tan G\u00fcnd\u00fcz, &lt;a href=\"Aydemir%20G%C3%BCler\"&gt;Aydemir G\u00fcler&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to some parts in the party programme Socialist Turkey Party was closed on 30 November 1993 by the order of Constitutional Court.\nS\u0130P era (1993\u20132001).\nAfter the closure of STP, the party cadres immediately formed the Party for Socialist Power (\"Sosyalist \u0130ktidar Partisi\") S\u0130P. In the same year an internal division occurred within the party, culminating in the exit of Metin \u00c7ulhao\u011flu and his followers. After this incident the head of the party became Aydemir G\u00fcler.\nDuring December 1995 general elections the party had no right to enter the elections. S\u0130P entered the Labour, Peace and Freedom Bloc headed by HADEP. After the election, the party had urged the participants to proceed with the bloc however the components refused to further collaborate with Kurdish nationalists. S\u0130P had led the 1996 Istanbul University occupation and sit-in acts protesting the fees. The party had also made its name heads by holding an unannounced meeting in the banned Taksim Square on May Day 1996. After the exposure of the &lt;a href=\"Susurluk%20scandal\"&gt;Susurluk scandal&lt;/a&gt; the party encouraged the masses to take to the streets for protesting the regime that had connections with politicians-mobs-drug dealers etc. In the same year the party started a campaign that demanded the closure of the &lt;a href=\"McDonald%27s\"&gt;McDonald's&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East%20Technical%20University\"&gt;Middle East Technical University&lt;/a&gt; Campus, Ankara.\nIn 1999 S\u0130P entered the general elections for the first time under the leadership of Aydemir G\u00fcler and received 37,680 votes (%0.12). During the campaign process for the general elections party member &lt;a href=\"H%C3%BCseyin%20Duman\"&gt;H\u00fcseyin Duman&lt;/a&gt; was shot dead by a rightist politician \u0130hsan Bal.\nIn 2000 S\u0130P emphasized on the ban on founding a party with \"communist\" adjective on its name. Thus party member &lt;a href=\"Yal%C3%A7%C4%B1n%20Cerit\"&gt;Yal\u00e7\u0131n Cerit&lt;/a&gt; had applied to the authorities and found a new party called Communist Party (\"Kom\u00fcnist Parti\"). In spite of the law forbidding to form a party with the word \"communist\" in the name no legal steps were taken by the officials while S\u0130P party members organised activities with both party names.\nFounding of TKP and onwards (starting with 2001).\nIn the 6th Extraordinary Congress of S\u0130P which was held on 11 November 2001, it has been announced that Communist Party has merged with the Party for Socialist Power and the name of the party has been changed to Communist Party of Turkey (\"T\u00fcrkiye Kom\u00fcnist Partisi\") TKP. With this congress communists from other organisations including the followers of Metin \u00c7ulhao\u011flu had joined the ranks. The Central Committee was formed with the following: Aydemir G\u00fcler, Kemal Okuyan, S\u00fcleyman Baba, U\u011fur \u0130\u015flek, Erkin \u00d6zalp, H\u00fcseyin Karabulut, Kurtulu\u015f K\u0131l\u00e7er, O\u011fuz Kavala, H\u00fcsn\u00fc Atl\u0131kan, Yal\u00e7\u0131n Cerit, Mesut Odman, G\u00fclay Din\u00e7el, Alper Dizdar, Gamze Erbil, Mehmet Kuzulugil, Ya\u015far \u00c7elik, Nihal \u0130mery\u00fcz, Tun\u00e7 Tato\u011flu, Sedat Cengiz, Haluk \u0130mery\u00fcz, Arif Basa, Atilla G\u00f6k\u00e7ek. Aydemir G\u00fcler was selected as President and Kemal Okuyan as General Secretary. The founding date of the party was declared as 10 September 1920 Baku Congress.\nDuring this period some of the main campaigns and achievements of the party were:\nDissolution and reformation.\nAfter a period of internal strife, two rival factions of TKP reached a consensus on 15 July 2014 to freeze the activities of the party and that neither faction shall use the name and emblem of TKP. The faction led by &lt;a href=\"Erkan%20Ba%C5%9F\"&gt;Erkan Ba\u015f&lt;/a&gt; and Metin \u00c7ulhao\u011flu adopted the name &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Communist%20Party%20of%20Turkey\"&gt;People's Communist Party of Turkey&lt;/a&gt; and the faction led by &lt;a href=\"Kemal%20Okuyan\"&gt;Kemal Okuyan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aydemir%20G%C3%BCler\"&gt;Aydemir G\u00fcler&lt;/a&gt; founded the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20%28Turkey%2C%202014%29\"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 22 January 2017, a congress was held by the initiation of seven well-known figures in the left-wing politics. The congress was embraced by independent communists and also by the Communist Party. The congress announced that the TKP name will not be left unguarded and declared that TKP is back in the political scene.\nOrganisational structure.\nThe party's organisational structure is similar to that of an orthodox communist party. The basic unit is called cell, and the party has various cells in workshops, plants, neighbourhoods. These cells form the basis of district committees and eventually city committees. The deciding organ of the party is party congress where delegates from every organisation determine the Central Committee which has the authority between congresses. The Central Committee determines within itself a General Secretary whose responsibilities are; making sure that the Central Committee works are coordinated, the political and organisational activities of the party are guided closely and representing the party in national and international platforms.\nRelations with other parties and internationalism.\nThe party sees &lt;a href=\"Justice%20and%20Development%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;AKP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Republican%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;CHP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nationalist%20Movement%20Party\"&gt;MHP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peoples%27%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;HDP&lt;/a&gt; as bourgeois parties and classifies them as opposing class parties. The party has warm relations with the Federation of Socialist Assemblies (\"Sosyalist Meclisler Federasyonu\"), and the two organisations formed an electoral alliance in several provinces in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Turkish%20local%20elections\"&gt;2019 Turkish local elections&lt;/a&gt;, which emerged victorious in the provincial centre of &lt;a href=\"Tunceli\"&gt;Tunceli&lt;/a&gt;. The party also has warm relations with &lt;a href=\"Left%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;SOL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;EMEP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halkevleri\"&gt;Halkevleri&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party defends an orthodox view in communist movement and urges the movement to define its borders clearly. The party is quite close to &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Communist Party of Greece&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Workers%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Communist Party of the Workers of Spain&lt;/a&gt; in international level. It has ties with many communist and worker's parties in the Middle East, Caucasus and Balkans. It has close relations with the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Cuba\"&gt;Communist Party of Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, leading a pioneer role in the solidarity for Cuba. TKP is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Initiative%20of%20Communist%20and%20Workers%27%20Parties\"&gt;Initiative of Communist and Workers' Parties&lt;/a&gt;. The party joins the efforts to build an international focal point by issuing a magazine about communist theory called \"International Communist Review\". The youth of TKP is a member of &lt;a href=\"World%20Federation%20of%20Democratic%20Youth\"&gt;World Federation of Democratic Youth&lt;/a&gt;.\nElectoral performance.\nIn the 2007 election, the party obtained its best percentage result in &lt;a href=\"Ardahan%20Province\"&gt;Ardahan&lt;/a&gt; on the border with &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, where it got 1.42% with 787 votes, even though the party did not maintain offices in the province.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Turkish%20local%20elections\"&gt;municipal election of 31 March 2019&lt;/a&gt;, TKP's candidate &lt;a href=\"Fatih%20Mehmet%20Ma%C3%A7o%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Fatih Mehmet Ma\u00e7o\u011flu&lt;/a&gt; won in the mainly &lt;a href=\"Zazas\"&gt;Zaza&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tunceli%20Province\"&gt;Tunceli Province&lt;/a&gt;, with 32% of the votes cast. The Kurdish opposition party, the &lt;a href=\"Peoples%27%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;People's Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, came second with 28%, followed by the &lt;a href=\"social%20democratic\"&gt;social democratic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kemalism\"&gt;Kemalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Republican%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;Republican People\u2019s Party&lt;/a&gt; at 20%."
