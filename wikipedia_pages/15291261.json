    "text": "Jessie Bartlett Davis (1860 \u2013 May 14, 1905) was an &lt;a href=\"Americans\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic singer and actress from &lt;a href=\"Morris%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Morris, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, who was billed as \"America's Representative &lt;a href=\"Contralto\"&gt;Contralto&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOpera and acting.\nShe was born Jessie Fremont Bartlett, one of ten children of farmer and country &lt;a href=\"schoolmaster\"&gt;schoolmaster&lt;/a&gt; Elias Lyman Bartlett (b. 1821) and his wife Rachael Ann (n\u00e9e Conklin) Bartlett (b. 1826). After Jessie and her older sister Arabelle \"Belle\" (1855\u201374) had become known locally as singers, they were approached by traveling managers and began touring along the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;West Coast of the United States&lt;/a&gt;. Belle died shortly after a tour was arranged. Another sister, Josephine Bartlett Perry (1859\u20131910) also performed in theater, in the Chicago Ideal Opera Company.\nJessie Bartlett moved to &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, where she went on a one-season tour with Caroline Richings. She studied voice in Chicago with &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Robinson-Duff\"&gt;Sarah Robinson-Duff&lt;/a&gt;, sang in the choir of the Church of the Messiah, and her manager convinced her to join the Chicago Church Choir Company.\nIn 1879, Bartlett made her debut in the &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan\"&gt;Gilbert and Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; opera \"&lt;a href=\"H.M.S.%20Pinafore\"&gt;H.M.S. Pinafore&lt;/a&gt;\", in the role of Buttercup, in a troop managed by Col. Jack H. Haverly. On the road the production was managed by Haverly employee, Will J. Davis, whom Bartlett married in 1880. She spent several years with a number of opera companies before joining the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Ideal%20Opera%20Company\"&gt;Boston Ideal Opera Company&lt;/a&gt;. She performed with this troupe until 1901, serving as its &lt;a href=\"prima%20donna\"&gt;prima donna&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer most famous role was as Alan a-Dale in the 1890 opera \"&lt;a href=\"Robin%20Hood%20in%20popular%20culture%23Music\"&gt;Robin Hood&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20De%20Koven\"&gt;Reginald De Koven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clement%20Scott\"&gt;Clement Scott&lt;/a&gt;. She introduced the song \"&lt;a href=\"Oh%20Promise%20Me\"&gt;Oh Promise Me&lt;/a&gt;\" which became very popular. She starred in grand operas, including \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20Huguenots\"&gt;Les Huguenots&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Martha\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Merry%20Wives%20of%20Windsor%20%28opera%29\"&gt;The Merry Wives of Windsor&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20trovatore\"&gt;Il trovatore&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Dinorah\"&gt;Dinorah&lt;/a&gt;\". She performed with &lt;a href=\"Adelina%20Patti\"&gt;Adelina Patti&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Faust%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Faust&lt;/a&gt;\" while in the &lt;a href=\"James%20Henry%20Mapleson\"&gt;James Henry Mapleson&lt;/a&gt; Opera company, and toured with them for one season in Europe.\nOn March 16, 1897, Davis opened on &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20theatre\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Serenade\"&gt;The Serenade&lt;/a&gt;\", playing Dolores. In 1898 she recorded \"Don Jose of Sevilla\", a &lt;a href=\"duet%20%28music%29\"&gt;duet&lt;/a&gt; from \"The Serenade\", with W. H. MacDonald. From October 19 to November 28, 1903, she appeared again on Broadway in a revival of Edward Jakobowski's &lt;a href=\"operetta\"&gt;operetta&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Erminie\"&gt;Erminie&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFor her 1902 appearance at Denver, Colorado's, &lt;a href=\"Elitch%20Theatre\"&gt;Elitch Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, the local newspaper reported: \"A characteristically clever stroke of business, and a brilliant achievement on the part of &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Elitch%20Long\"&gt;Mary Elitch Long&lt;/a&gt;, is the securing of Jessie Bartlett Davis for the production of &lt;a href=\"A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream\"&gt;A Midsummer Night's Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The combination is superlatively attractive. Jessie Bartlett Davis has no peer among American singers.\"\nShe appeared briefly in &lt;a href=\"vaudeville\"&gt;vaudeville&lt;/a&gt;, where she reportedly earned $1,000 per week.\nSongwriter/Writer.\nJessie Bartlett Davis released the &lt;a href=\"parlour%20music\"&gt;parlor songs&lt;/a&gt; collection \"It's Just Because I Love You So\" in 1900. The collection reflects the &lt;a href=\"Gay%20Nineties\"&gt;Gay Nineties&lt;/a&gt; attitude of the 1890s &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt;. She helped &lt;a href=\"Carrie%20Jacobs-Bond\"&gt;Carrie Jacobs-Bond&lt;/a&gt; launch her songwriting career by volunteering to pay for the cost to publish \"Seven Songs: as Unpretentious as the Wild Rose\", which included the classic wedding song \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Love%20You%20Truly\"&gt;I Love You Truly&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nShe was also an author and wrote \"Only a Chorus Girl\", other stories, and a number of poems.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1880 she married William James Davis, a Chicago theatrical manager, who worked for the &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Frohman\"&gt;Frohman&lt;/a&gt;/Klaw/Erlanger theater syndicate and managed Chicago's Iroquois Theatre at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Iroquois%20Theatre%20fire\"&gt;1903 fire&lt;/a&gt;. Jessie had a minor interest in the Iroquois Theater. The Davises had one son who survived infancy, William J. Davis Jr., who as an adult worked with his father in Chicago theater management. The couple had a home on Grand Avenue in Chicago and a &lt;a href=\"summer%20home\"&gt;summer home&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Point%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Crown Point, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. Called Willowdale (later named Ellendale), it was where they raised Standardbred trotting horses, collies, and fox terriers. Author and poet &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Field\"&gt;Eugene Field&lt;/a&gt; was a particular friend and wrote several newspaper columns featuring Jessie and Will. Other friends of the Davises included playwright &lt;a href=\"George%20Ade\"&gt;George Ade&lt;/a&gt;, newspaper cartoonist &lt;a href=\"John%20T.%20McCutcheon\"&gt;John T. McCutcheon&lt;/a&gt;, Australian landowner &lt;a href=\"William%20Pinkerton\"&gt;William Pinkerton&lt;/a&gt;, and Civil War hero, Orville T. Chamberlain.\nJessie died unexpectedly of &lt;a href=\"Bright%27s%20disease\"&gt;Bright's disease&lt;/a&gt;. She is buried in Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition\"&gt;World's Columbian Exposition&lt;/a&gt; of 1893, the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Science%20and%20Industry%20%28Chicago%29\"&gt;Fine Arts Building&lt;/a&gt; included in its list of exhibits \"Bust of Mrs. Jessie Bartlett Davis (Marble) (Lent by Mr. Davis, Chicago)\", by Aloys Loeher."
