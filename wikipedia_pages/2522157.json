    "text": "Namtso or Lake Nam (officially: Nam Co; ; \u201cHeavenly Lake\u201d; in European literature: Tengri Nor, ) is a mountain lake on the border between &lt;a href=\"Damxung%20County\"&gt;Damxung County&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lhasa%20%28prefecture-level%20city%29\"&gt;Lhasa prefecture-level city&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baingoin%20County\"&gt;Baingoin County&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nagqu%20Prefecture\"&gt;Nagqu Prefecture&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tibet%20Autonomous%20Region\"&gt;Tibet Autonomous Region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, approximately NNW of &lt;a href=\"Lhasa\"&gt;Lhasa&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nNamtso is a lake that first formed during the &lt;a href=\"Paleogene\"&gt;Paleogene&lt;/a&gt; age, as a result of Himalayan tectonic plate movements. The lake lies at an elevation of , and has a surface area of . This &lt;a href=\"salt%20lake%20%28geography%29\"&gt;salt lake&lt;/a&gt; is the largest &lt;a href=\"lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tibet%20Autonomous%20Region\"&gt;Tibet Autonomous Region&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is not the largest lake on the &lt;a href=\"Qinghai-Tibet%20Plateau\"&gt;Qinghai-Tibet Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. That title belongs to &lt;a href=\"Qinghai%20Lake\"&gt;Qinghai Lake&lt;/a&gt; (more than twice the size of Namtso); which lies more than to the north-east in &lt;a href=\"Qinghai\"&gt;Qinghai&lt;/a&gt;.\nNamtso has five uninhabited islands of reasonable size, in addition to one or two rocky outcrops. The islands have been used for spiritual retreat by pilgrims who walk over the lake's frozen surface at the end of winter, carrying their food with them. They spend the summer there, unable to return to shore again until the water freezes the following winter. This practice is no longer permitted by Chinese authorities.\nThe largest of the islands is in the northwest corner of the lake, and is about long and wide, rising to just over in the middle. At its closest point it is about from the shore.\nThe most remote island is, at its closest, from the shore. At summer time birds like &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20shelduck\"&gt;Ruddy shelduck&lt;/a&gt; and cormorants (&lt;a href=\"Phalacrocorax\"&gt;Phalacrocorax&lt;/a&gt; sp.) migrate to the lake area, besides the fields of \"Astragalus\", \"Roegneria nutans\" and Marram grass.\nClimate.\nThe weather at Namtso is subject to abrupt, sudden change and snowstorms are very common across the Nyainq\u00eantanglha range.\nNamtso has a &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"alpine%20climate\"&gt;alpine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"tundra%20climate\"&gt;tundra climate&lt;/a&gt; (Koppen ET).\nOther Features.\nNamtso is renowned as one of the most beautiful places in the &lt;a href=\"Nyainq%C3%AAntanglha\"&gt;Nyainq\u00eantanglha&lt;/a&gt; mountain range. Its cave &lt;a href=\"hermit\"&gt;hermit&lt;/a&gt;ages have for centuries been the destination of Tibetan &lt;a href=\"pilgrim\"&gt;pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;s. A surfaced road across &lt;a href=\"Laken%20Pass\"&gt;Laken Pass&lt;/a&gt; at 5186 m was completed to the lake in 2005, enabling easy access from &lt;a href=\"Lhasa\"&gt;Lhasa&lt;/a&gt; and the development of tourism at the lake. Settlements in the area include &lt;a href=\"Dobjoi\"&gt;Dobjoi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Donggar\"&gt;Donggar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cha%27gyungoinba\"&gt;Cha'gyungoinba&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tashi%20Dor\"&gt;Tashi Dor&lt;/a&gt; monastery is located at the southeastern corner of the lake.\nAround the area's natural elements, historical and anthropological background, a 2010 romantic drama &lt;a href=\"Shangri-La\"&gt;Shangri-La&lt;/a&gt;, starring China's popular actor &lt;a href=\"Hu%20Ge\"&gt;Hu Ge&lt;/a&gt;, was broadcast at CCTV1 and received positive reviews. Some scenes in the 2002 Hong Kong film &lt;a href=\"The%20Touch%20%282002%20film%29\"&gt;The Touch&lt;/a&gt; were filmed at the lake. Namtso Lake was featured in Episode 4, \"The Roof of the World\", of BBC TV series: \"&lt;a href=\"Himalaya%20with%20Michael%20Palin\"&gt;Himalaya with Michael Palin&lt;/a&gt;\". \nAsteroid.\nAsteroid &lt;a href=\"248388%20Namtso\"&gt;248388 Namtso&lt;/a&gt;, discovered by Italian astronomer &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Casulli\"&gt;Vincenzo Casulli&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, was named after the lake. The official was published by the &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Planet%20Center\"&gt;Minor Planet Center&lt;/a&gt; on 5 October 2017 ()."
