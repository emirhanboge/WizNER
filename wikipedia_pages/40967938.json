    "text": "Hyparrhenia rufa is a species of &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; known by the common names jaragu\u00e1, jaragu\u00e1 grass, and giant thatching grass. It is native to &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and it is widespread in the world as a cultivated &lt;a href=\"forage\"&gt;forage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fodder\"&gt;fodder&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"naturalisation%20%28biology%29\"&gt;naturalized&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes &lt;a href=\"invasive%20species\"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThis is usually a perennial grass, but it sometimes grows as an annual, and it is variable in form. It usually forms dense tufts of stems from a short &lt;a href=\"rhizome\"&gt;rhizome&lt;/a&gt;. The stems can be 30 centimeters to 3.5 meters tall. The leaf sheaths enclose the stem at intervals, making it appear banded. Flowering stems have sparse leaves, but &lt;a href=\"grazing\"&gt;grazing&lt;/a&gt; increases leaf production. The leaf blades are 30 to 60 centimeters long. The &lt;a href=\"panicle\"&gt;panicle&lt;/a&gt; is up to 80 centimeters long and is made up of many short, yellowish or red-tinged &lt;a href=\"raceme\"&gt;raceme&lt;/a&gt;s all subtended by a narrow, reddish &lt;a href=\"bract\"&gt;spathe&lt;/a&gt; a few centimeters long. The racemes are lined with pairs of spikelets, the red-haired fertile spikelets without stalks and the smaller sterile spikelets on stalks.\nThe rough-haired seeds are &lt;a href=\"seed%20dispersal\"&gt;dispersed&lt;/a&gt; in the fur of animals, on the wind, and on vehicles and machinery such as &lt;a href=\"grader\"&gt;grader&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEcology.\nIn its native range the grass grows in &lt;a href=\"woodland\"&gt;woodland&lt;/a&gt;s and seasonally flooded &lt;a href=\"grassland\"&gt;grassland&lt;/a&gt;s. It is also tolerant of &lt;a href=\"drought\"&gt;drought&lt;/a&gt; and easily naturalizes in disturbed habitat sites.\nSeveral species of &lt;a href=\"leafcutter%20ant\"&gt;leafcutter ant&lt;/a&gt;s have been observed foraging on jaragua, including \"&lt;a href=\"Atta%20capiguara\"&gt;Atta capiguara&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Atta%20laevigata\"&gt;A. laevigata&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe grass is susceptible to the &lt;a href=\"Plant%20pathology\"&gt;plant pathogenic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nematode\"&gt;nematode&lt;/a&gt;s \"&lt;a href=\"Helicotylenchus%20pseudopaxilli\"&gt;Helicotylenchus pseudopaxilli&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Pratylenchus%20brachyurus\"&gt;Pratylenchus brachyurus&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Longidorus%20laevicapitatus\"&gt;Longidorus laevicapitatus&lt;/a&gt;\". It can also host the &lt;a href=\"phytoplasma\"&gt;phytoplasma&lt;/a&gt; bacterium which causes &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20%28botany%29\"&gt;stunting&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pennisetum%20purpureum\"&gt;Napier grass&lt;/a&gt; (\"Pennisetum purpureum\"), and its infection has been dubbed \"Hyparrhenia\" grass white leaf disease.\nFeed.\nThis grass is grown in &lt;a href=\"pasture\"&gt;pasture&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"grazing\"&gt;grazing&lt;/a&gt; and is cut for &lt;a href=\"fodder\"&gt;fodder&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"hay\"&gt;hay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"silage\"&gt;silage&lt;/a&gt;. It is often used for grazing &lt;a href=\"beef%20cattle\"&gt;beef cattle&lt;/a&gt;, and it is also used to raise &lt;a href=\"dairy%20cattle\"&gt;dairy cattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s. It is not a very nutritious grass, so it is generally supplemented with &lt;a href=\"legume\"&gt;legume&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"molasses\"&gt;molasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juice%20vesicles\"&gt;citrus pulp&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"bran\"&gt;bran&lt;/a&gt; for energy. One experimental supplement for goats is a mix of &lt;a href=\"peanut\"&gt;groundnut cake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; bran. Legumes that have been added as supplements include \"&lt;a href=\"Cratylia%20argentea\"&gt;Cratylia argentea&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Erythrina%20poeppigiana\"&gt;Erythrina poeppigiana&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Gliricidia%20sepium\"&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Leucaena%20leucocephala\"&gt;Leucaena leucocephala&lt;/a&gt;\". The protein content and digestibility of the grass are lowest in the dry season.\nAs a weed.\nWhere it has been introduced into cultivation it has frequently taken hold in the local habitat, sometimes becoming an invasive component of the flora. On the &lt;a href=\"Llanos\"&gt;Llanos&lt;/a&gt; of South America it has grown easily on the moist grasslands that resemble those of its original range. It was introduced to the region to feed animals because native grasses are more fibrous and less nutritious. Its ability to outcompete native grasses such as \"&lt;a href=\"Trachypogon%20plumosus\"&gt;Trachypogon plumosus&lt;/a&gt;\" is thought to come from several factors, which may include higher rate of growth, &lt;a href=\"photosynthesis\"&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"germination\"&gt;germination&lt;/a&gt; of seeds, more efficient use of water, and more resources channeled into leaf development. It better tolerates loss of foliage to &lt;a href=\"herbivore\"&gt;herbivore&lt;/a&gt;s. It commonly &lt;a href=\"vegetative%20reproduction\"&gt;reproduces vegetatively&lt;/a&gt;, but it also produces large amounts of highly viable seed.\nThis grass is a &lt;a href=\"pyrophyte\"&gt;pyrophyte&lt;/a&gt;, well adapted to habitat with an annual &lt;a href=\"wildfire\"&gt;wildfire&lt;/a&gt; cycle. During the dry season it becomes very flammable. Wildfires in stands of native grasses are patchy and relatively limited. \"H. rufa\" forms dense monotypic stands of tall stems in the absence of grazing pressure, and these stands ignite easily, burn intensely, and spread fire into the surrounding forests. Not only does the grass make wildfire events more severe, but it increases in response to fire. Dry parts may be burned away, but living tissue near the ground is not harmed and resprouts immediately; fire damage to an established stand of the grass is \"negligible\".\nToday this species occurs as a weed in most &lt;a href=\"tropics\"&gt;tropical&lt;/a&gt; regions. It can be found in North, Central, and South America, many &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Islands\"&gt;Pacific Islands&lt;/a&gt;, Asia, parts of Africa outside its native range, and Australia.\nOther uses.\nThis tall grass can be used as &lt;a href=\"thatching\"&gt;thatching&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"straw\"&gt;straw&lt;/a&gt;, and as &lt;a href=\"Pulp%20%28paper%29\"&gt;pulp&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Papermaking\"&gt;making paper&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"East%20Africa\"&gt;East Africa&lt;/a&gt; it is planted as a border grass to prevent &lt;a href=\"erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt;."
