    "text": "\"Let the Music (Lift You Up)\" is a 1994 song by British &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house music&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"Loveland%20%28band%29\"&gt;Loveland&lt;/a&gt; featuring singer &lt;a href=\"Rachel%20McFarlane\"&gt;Rachel McFarlane&lt;/a&gt;, released as their debut single. It is a cover of a song by American singer Darlene Lewis and some of the single releases featured both versions. The Loveland version peaked at number 16 on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;, number-one on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Dance%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Dance Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; and won the Best Dance Record of the Year award at the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Clef%20Award\"&gt;Silver Clef Award&lt;/a&gt;. In 1995, it was included on the band's only album, \"The Wonder of Love\". \nCritical reception.\n&lt;a href=\"Larry%20Flick\"&gt;Larry Flick&lt;/a&gt; from American magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote, \"Virtually flawless &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; number is poised to glide from atop &lt;a href=\"UK%20Dance%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;U.K. dance charts&lt;/a&gt; onto stateside dancefloors within seconds. Track pumps a heavy beat, which is tied in flowing ribbons of strings and horns. &lt;a href=\"Rachel%20McFarlane\"&gt;Rachel McFarlane&lt;/a&gt; provides a bright flash of diva belting, proving her moxie by holding her own against a busy, effect-filled arrangement. Rhythm/crossover radio tastemakers are advised to open their minds and ears.\" Andy Beevers from \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20Week\"&gt;Music Week&lt;/a&gt;\" deemed it a \"huge house track from &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;\". He added, \"The Full On Vocal Mix, with its pounding pianos and hackneyed lyrics, is undeniably old-fashioned and is about as cheesy as a lorryload of &lt;a href=\"Wotsits\"&gt;Wotsits&lt;/a&gt;. But it comes with a guarantee to create absolute mayhem on all but the most elite of dancefloors.\" &lt;a href=\"James%20Hamilton%20%28DJ%20and%20journalist%29\"&gt;James Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; from the magazine's \"RM\" Dance Update said that the Loveland cover version of the Darlene Lewis song is \"much more exciting\". \nReferences.\n "
