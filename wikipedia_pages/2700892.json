    "text": "\"Straight Up\" is the breakthrough song for American recording artist &lt;a href=\"Paula%20Abdul\"&gt;Paula Abdul&lt;/a&gt; from her debut studio &lt;a href=\"album\"&gt;album&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Forever%20Your%20Girl\"&gt;Forever Your Girl&lt;/a&gt;\" (1988). The song is a mid-tempo &lt;a href=\"dance-pop\"&gt;dance-pop&lt;/a&gt; song with influence from the &lt;a href=\"pop%20rock\"&gt;pop rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"new%20jack%20swing\"&gt;new jack swing&lt;/a&gt; genres. Written and produced entirely by &lt;a href=\"Elliot%20Wolff\"&gt;Elliot Wolff&lt;/a&gt;, the song was released as the album's third single on November 22, 1988, by &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Records\"&gt;Virgin Records&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Straight Up\" became her first top 40 hit in the United States, earning her first chart-topper on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;. Her first 2 singles were modest hits that sparked a little interest in her album. \"Straight Up\" helped her album reach the top 20 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, before it finally reached number one after a record-setting 64 weeks on the market after 3 more #1 hits. \"Straight Up\" brought her widespread public attention, and has remained as her biggest international hit to date, reaching the top-10 region in over 11 countries. The song was then included in her six compilation albums, released between 1998 and 2013.\nThe song also received positive reviews from music critics, with &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20J.%20Levitin\"&gt;Daniel J. Levitin&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"This%20Is%20Your%20Brain%20On%20Music\"&gt;This Is Your Brain on Music&lt;/a&gt;\" praising the song as \"hold[ing] a certain appeal over many, many listenings.\" It also earned Abdul several nominations in the US, most notably including her first &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Awards%20of%201990\"&gt;Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt; nomination in the category of &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance\"&gt;Best Female Pop Vocal Performance&lt;/a&gt; in 1990, and six other nominations for its music video at the &lt;a href=\"1989%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards\"&gt;1989 MTV Video Music Awards&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAccording to Paula Abdul, her mother found this song for her. She explains that her mother knew someone whose boyfriend was an aspiring songwriter, and she got \"Straight Up\" as an 8-track demo. The demo version was \u201cso bad\u201d that Abdul\u2019s mother was \"crying laughing\" at it, and threw it in the trash. But Abdul heard something she liked in it, and retrieved it. At that time she was a full-time choreographer, and on the side, late at night she was recording music. The record label didn't think the song was any good but Abdul offered to record two songs they wanted, which she didn't like, if they would let her do \"Straight Up\". The song was recorded at a cost of $3,000. Later a friend of hers told her that somebody with her same name was being played on a northern California radio station. \"Literally, within 10 days I [it] sold a million copies.\" The song was originally recorded in a bathroom, and in the masters of the recording, someone in the next apartment can be heard yelling \"Shut up\".\n\"Straight Up\" was the third single released from her debut album \"&lt;a href=\"Forever%20Your%20Girl\"&gt;Forever Your Girl&lt;/a&gt;,\" after \"&lt;a href=\"Knocked%20Out\"&gt;Knocked Out&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"%28It%27s%20Just%29%20The%20Way%20That%20You%20Love%20Me\"&gt;The Way That You Love Me&lt;/a&gt;.\" While the latter found modest success on the &lt;a href=\"Rhythm%20and%20blues\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; charts, to radio station &lt;a href=\"KMEL\"&gt;KMEL&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco started playing \"Straight Up\" from the album. The label switched promotion \"The Way That You Love Me\" to \"Straight Up\". The strategy paid off, as \"Straight Up\" was followed by three more number-one hits. \"The Way That You Love Me\" was promoted a year later scoring a 5th top 5 hit in the US.\nOne of the 12\" versions was remixed by LA \"Powermixers\" Chris Modig and Boris Granich, known for their special Power mixes at Power 106 during the 1980s.\nComposition.\n\"Straight Up\" is performed in the key of &lt;a href=\"D%20minor\"&gt;D minor&lt;/a&gt; with a shuffling &lt;a href=\"tempo\"&gt;tempo&lt;/a&gt; of 96 beats per minute in &lt;a href=\"Time%20signature\"&gt;common time&lt;/a&gt; and a chord progression of Dm\u2013B\u2013Gm\u2013Am. Running a total length of four minutes and eleven seconds in its original version, the song finds Abdul's vocals span from A3 to C5 in the song, while the singer questioning her partner if he was genuinely loving her or \"just having fun\".\nCommercial performance.\n\"Straight Up\" attained breakthrough success for Abdul in the States. After debuting at number 79 on the US &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; chart on the week of December 3, 1988, the single quickly rose up the chart. By the week of January 21, 1989, the song reached number 13 on the chart, becoming her first top 40 entry and her first #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart on the week of February 11, 1989, dethroning &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20%28band%29\"&gt;Sheriff&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"When%20I%27m%20with%20You%20%28Sheriff%20song%29\"&gt;When I'm with You&lt;/a&gt;\" and remaining on the top spot for three consecutive weeks. The song has since spent a total 25 consecutive chart weeks, thus tying with her &lt;a href=\"%28It%27s%20Just%29%20The%20Way%20That%20You%20Love%20Me\"&gt;later re-released second single&lt;/a&gt; as her longest charting performance on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and was eventually ranked as the fourth biggest hit of 1989 on \"Billboard\"s year-end chart for that year. The single was certified &lt;a href=\"RIAA%20certification\"&gt;Platinum&lt;/a&gt; by the RIAA with sales of more than one million units, and remained as her best-selling single in the country to date.\nThe song also attained international success, reaching the top 10 in over 11 countries. In addition to topping the charts in the United States, the single also reached the top in Norway. It reached number three in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany. It also reached number eight in Austria, number five in Belgium, and number two in Canada, the Netherlands and Sweden. In France, the single fell short of the top 10, reaching number 12. In Oceania, the single received mixed success. The song fell short of the top 20 in Australia, reaching number 27. In New Zealand, however, the single did much better, reaching number six.\nMusic video.\nThe song became so popular that it ascended up the charts before a &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; had even been shot for the song. The black and white video, directed by &lt;a href=\"David%20Fincher\"&gt;David Fincher&lt;/a&gt; and choreographed by Abdul herself in mid-January 1989, won four &lt;a href=\"1989%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards\"&gt;1989 MTV Video Music Awards&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Video\"&gt;Best Female Video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Editing\"&gt;Best Editing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Choreography\"&gt;Best Choreography&lt;/a&gt;, and the first &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dance%20Video\"&gt;Best Dance Video&lt;/a&gt;. The video features an appearance by her friend, comedian &lt;a href=\"Arsenio%20Hall\"&gt;Arsenio Hall&lt;/a&gt;, whose popular talk show had premiered a few weeks prior to the video shoot. &lt;a href=\"Djimon%20Hounsou\"&gt;Djimon Hounsou&lt;/a&gt; also appears. Released later that month, the video at the time went into very heavy rotation on &lt;a href=\"MTV\"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;, helping further Abdul's popularity.\nTrack listings and formats.\nAustralia 12-inch single\nFrench 12-inch vinyl\nUS 12-inch single\nJapanese mini-CD single"
