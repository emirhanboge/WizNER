In his senior year, he led the nation in &lt;a href=\"rush%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;rushing&lt;/a&gt; and won the 1990 &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Payton%20Award\"&gt;Walter Payton Award&lt;/a&gt; as the most outstanding player in &lt;a href=\"Division%20I-AA\"&gt;Division I-AA&lt;/a&gt; football. He played professional football for one season in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL) after he was selected by the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20Packers\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; in the sixth round of the &lt;a href=\"1991%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1991 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nDean was born on June 1, 1968, in &lt;a href=\"Ruston%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Ruston, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, to Walter, a concrete company dispatcher, and Betty Dean, an administrative secretary at &lt;a href=\"Grambling%20State%20University\"&gt;Grambling State University&lt;/a&gt;. He also has a younger brother who played soccer, Keith, who was one of Louisiana's leading &lt;a href=\"high%20school%20football\"&gt;interscholastic&lt;/a&gt; players, and with whom he shared a bunk-bed according to their mother. Walter Dean attended &lt;a href=\"Grambling%20State%20University%20Laboratory%20High%20School\"&gt;Grambling State University Laboratory High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grambling%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Grambling, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; and turned down &lt;a href=\"athletic%20scholarship\"&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; from major college football programs such as &lt;a href=\"Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"LSU%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Louisiana State&lt;/a&gt; in order to attend Grambling State. Dean said, \"I wanted to go to a college where everybody I knew wouldn't have to sign up for a &lt;a href=\"frequent-flyer%20program\"&gt;frequent-flyer program&lt;/a&gt; in order to see me play.\"\nCollege career.\nAt Grambling, Dean studied &lt;a href=\"business%20management\"&gt;business management&lt;/a&gt; and played football for the &lt;a href=\"Grambling%20State%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Grambling State Tigers&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"running%20back\"&gt;running back&lt;/a&gt;. He earned the nickname \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Express\"&gt;American Express&lt;/a&gt;\" due to the belief of his coach, &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Robinson%20%28football%20coach%29\"&gt;Eddie Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, that the team should 'never leave home without him', a saying similar to the slogan of the eponymous credit card company. \"&lt;a href=\"Sports%20Illustrated\"&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/a&gt;\" called Dean possibly the \"best runner produced by a predominantly black college since &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Payton\"&gt;Walter Payton&lt;/a&gt; came out of &lt;a href=\"Jackson%20State%20University\"&gt;Jackson State&lt;/a&gt; in 1975.\" Former Grambling and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Rams\"&gt;Los Angeles Rams&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fullback%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;fullback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paul%20%26quot%3BTank%26quot%3B%20Younger\"&gt;Paul \"Tank\" Younger&lt;/a&gt; said about Dean, \"You take one look at him and you think, hey, he doesn't look that tough. He isn't the huge, muscle-flexing type of back, but once you see him run the ball, you want to check out his scrapbook.\"\nAt Grambling, Dean recorded a career total of 3,328 yards and 41 touchdowns. As a junior in 1989, Dean scored 18 &lt;a href=\"touchdown\"&gt;touchdown&lt;/a&gt;s and set a school &lt;a href=\"rush%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;rushing&lt;/a&gt; record when he compiled 1,269 yards. In 1990, Dean recorded 17 touchdowns and the Division I-AA season-best 1,401 rushing yards. Against , he recorded 137 yards on just 15 carries (9.13 average). Against &lt;a href=\"Hampton%20Pirates\"&gt;Hampton&lt;/a&gt;, he compiled a career-high 232 yards and helped lead the Tigers to a 22-3 victory. Grambling finished the season with an 8\u20133 record, including a win against their arch-rival, , in the &lt;a href=\"Bayou%20Classic\"&gt;Bayou Classic&lt;/a&gt;.\nEddie Robinson believed that Dean was deserving of the &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, awarded annually to the best college football player, but acknowledged that voters would not seriously consider a Division I-AA player for the honor. Dean did, however, win the &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Payton%20Award\"&gt;Walter Payton Award&lt;/a&gt;, which is the award bestowed annually upon Division I-AA football's most outstanding player.\nProfessional football.\nDean was selected in the sixth round of the &lt;a href=\"1991%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1991 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20Packers\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; (149th pick overall). He then played &lt;a href=\"1991%20Green%20Bay%20Packers%20season\"&gt;one season&lt;/a&gt; for Green Bay. In 1991, he saw action in nine games and recorded one &lt;a href=\"kick%20return\"&gt;kick return&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"fumble\"&gt;fumble&lt;/a&gt;."
