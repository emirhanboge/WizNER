    "text": "Cathkin Park was a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; ground in the &lt;a href=\"Crosshill%2C%20Glasgow\"&gt;Crosshill&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. It was the home ground of &lt;a href=\"Third%20Lanark%20A.C.\"&gt;Third Lanark&lt;/a&gt; from their foundation in 1872 until they moved to &lt;a href=\"Cathkin%20Park\"&gt;New Cathkin Park&lt;/a&gt; in 1903. It also hosted &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; final matches and the &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland national team&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Lanark%20A.C.\"&gt;Third Lanark&lt;/a&gt; were founded in 1872 by members of the Third Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers and began playing on a piece of land that formed part of a drilling field for the regiment. As the stadium developed, a grandstand was built on the western side of the pitch, a pavilion in the north-west corner, open seating on the northern and eastern sides of the pitch, and embankments at the southern end. An early experiment in &lt;a href=\"floodlight\"&gt;floodlight&lt;/a&gt;ing was conducted there in October 1878. The ground was considered good enough to host the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1882%20Scottish%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1881%E2%80%9382%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;1881\u201382&lt;/a&gt;, as well as its replay, with 14,000 turning up to watch &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Park%20F.C.\"&gt;Queen's Park&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href=\"Dumbarton%20F.C.\"&gt;Dumbarton&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20131. It was also selected as the venue of the &lt;a href=\"1883%E2%80%9384%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;1883\u201384 final&lt;/a&gt;, although the match did not happen as &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Leven%20F.C.\"&gt;Vale of Leven&lt;/a&gt; did not have enough players available, and was used again for the &lt;a href=\"1885%E2%80%9386%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;1885\u201386&lt;/a&gt; final. In 1884 it hosted two &lt;a href=\"1883%E2%80%9384%20British%20Home%20Championship\"&gt;British Home Championship&lt;/a&gt; international matches, with &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; beating &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in front of 10,000 spectators on 15 March (the first ever all-ticket match) and &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20131 in front of 5,000 on 29 March.\nThird Lanark were founder members of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish Football League&lt;/a&gt; in 1890, and the first league match was played at Cathkin Park on 23 August 1890, with Dumbarton winning 3\u20131. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"1890%E2%80%9391%20Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;1890\u201391 season&lt;/a&gt; it hosted a championship play-off between Dumbarton and &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, who had finished level on points. Following a 2\u20132 draw in front of 10,000 spectators, the clubs were jointly awarded the championship. The ground was used for play-offs again on 20 May 1896 when a match took place to decide which club would finish third and fourth in Division Two; &lt;a href=\"Renton%20F.C.\"&gt;Renton&lt;/a&gt; beating &lt;a href=\"Kilmarnock%20F.C.\"&gt;Kilmarnock&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131.\nThe ground's highest league attendance of 16,000 was set on 19 August 1899 when Rangers visited, with the visitors winning 5\u20131. This was equalled for another game against Rangers on 28 September 1901, this time the game ending 2\u20132. In June 1902 the final of the first major Anglo-Scottish club competition, the &lt;a href=\"British%20League%20Cup\"&gt;British League Cup&lt;/a&gt;, took place at Cathkin (att: 10,000), won by Celtic against Rangers 3\u20132 after extra time.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"1902%E2%80%9303%20Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;1902\u201303 season&lt;/a&gt; the club left the original Cathkin Park to move to a new ground. Queen's Park had built a new stadium to replace their leased Hampden Park ground \u2013 which was about south of Cathkin \u2013 but had also named the new stadium &lt;a href=\"Hampden%20Park\"&gt;Hampden Park&lt;/a&gt;. Third Lanark took over the older Hampden, renaming it &lt;a href=\"Cathkin%20Park\"&gt;New Cathkin Park&lt;/a&gt;, although it later became known as simply Cathkin Park. Third Lanark's final league game at the old Cathkin Park was played on 4 April 1903, with the club losing 1\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee&lt;/a&gt;. However, the final league match played at the ground was played on 17 October 1903, when Queen's Park used it as a home ground for their game against &lt;a href=\"Partick%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Partick Thistle&lt;/a&gt; (a 1\u20131 draw) as the new Hampden Park was not yet ready. After the new Hampden opened, Third Lanark used it for much of the &lt;a href=\"1903%E2%80%9304%20Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;1903\u201304 season&lt;/a&gt; (which ended with them winning the league title) whilst building work was carried out at New Cathkin Park.\nThe site of the original Cathkin Park was subsequently used for housing."
