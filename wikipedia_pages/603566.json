    "text": "Joseph Paul Torre (; born July 18, 1940) is an American professional &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Senior%20management\"&gt;executive&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a special assistant to the &lt;a href=\"Commissioner%20of%20Baseball\"&gt;Commissioner of Baseball&lt;/a&gt; since 2020. He previously served in the capacity of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;'s (MLB) chief baseball officer from 2011 to 2020. A former player, &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; and television &lt;a href=\"color%20commentator\"&gt;color commentator&lt;/a&gt;, Torre ranks fifth all-time in MLB history with 2,326 &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20managers%20by%20wins\"&gt;wins as a manager&lt;/a&gt;. With 2,342 &lt;a href=\"Hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; during his playing career, Torre is the only major leaguer to achieve both 2,000 hits as a player and 2,000 wins as a manager. From 1996 to 2007, he was the manager of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; and guided the team to six pennants and four &lt;a href=\"World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20World%20Series%20champions\"&gt;championships&lt;/a&gt;.\nTorre's lengthy and distinguished career in MLB began as a player in 1960 with the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Braves%20%281953%E2%80%9365%29\"&gt;Milwaukee Braves&lt;/a&gt;, as a &lt;a href=\"catcher\"&gt;catcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"third%20baseman\"&gt;third baseman&lt;/a&gt;. He also played for the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; until becoming a manager in 1977, when he briefly served as the Mets' &lt;a href=\"player-manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;player-manager&lt;/a&gt;. His managerial career covered 29 seasons, including tenures with the same three clubs for which he played, and the Yankees and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;, until 2010. From 1984 to 1989, he served as a television &lt;a href=\"color%20commentator\"&gt;color commentator&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"California%20Angels\"&gt;California Angels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;. After retiring as a manager, he accepted a role assisting the Commissioner as the executive vice president of baseball operations.\nA nine-time &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt;, Torre won the 1971 &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; (NL) &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;Most Valuable Player&lt;/a&gt; (MVP) Award after leading the major leagues in &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20batting%20champions\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20annual%20runs%20batted%20in%20leaders\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt;. After qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason\"&gt;playoffs&lt;/a&gt; just once while managing the Mets, Braves, and Cardinals, Torre's greatest success came as manager of the Yankees. His clubs compiled a .605 regular-season winning percentage and made the playoffs every year, winning four World Series titles, six &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; (AL) &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20American%20League%20pennant%20winners\"&gt;pennants&lt;/a&gt;, and ten &lt;a href=\"American%20League%20East\"&gt;AL East&lt;/a&gt; division titles. In 1996 and 1998, he was the AL &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Manager%20of%20the%20Year%20Award\"&gt;Manager of the Year&lt;/a&gt;. He also won two &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20West\"&gt;NL West&lt;/a&gt; division titles with the Dodgers for a total of 13 division titles. In &lt;a href=\"2014%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, Torre was elected to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum\"&gt;National Baseball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nJoseph Torre was born July 18, 1940, in &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Brooklyn, New York&lt;/a&gt;. He is the youngest of five children, two girls and three boys of Italian immigrants Joe, Sr., a &lt;a href=\"Undercover%20operation%23Plainclothes%20law%20enforcement\"&gt;plainclothes officer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Police%20Department\"&gt;New York City Police Department&lt;/a&gt;, and Margaret. Joe, Sr. abused Margaret until Torre was 13 years old when Torre's brother, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Torre\"&gt;Frank&lt;/a&gt;, convinced their father to move out. They would later divorce.\nTorre is of &lt;a href=\"Italians\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; descent. He was raised in the &lt;a href=\"Marine%20Park%2C%20Brooklyn\"&gt;Marine Park&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;. His siblings include two older brothers, Frank and Rocco, and an older sister, Marguerite. Torre grew up a &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; fan.\nTorre played baseball at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Francis%20Preparatory%20School\"&gt;Saint Francis Prep&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"All-American%20Amateur%20Baseball%20Association\"&gt;All-American Amateur Baseball Association&lt;/a&gt; for the Brooklyn Cadets. Heavyset as a teenager, Torre was not considered a viable professional prospect until he converted to catcher on the advice of his brother, Frank. Torre worked briefly at the &lt;a href=\"American%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;American Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; after high school.\nPlaying career.\nMilwaukee/Atlanta Braves (1960\u20131968).\nTorre followed in his brother &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Torre\"&gt;Frank Torre&lt;/a&gt;'s footsteps when he was signed by the Milwaukee Braves as an amateur &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1959%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1959&lt;/a&gt;. In his first season in the &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;minor leagues&lt;/a&gt; with the Class A &lt;a href=\"Eau%20Claire%20Bears\"&gt;Eau Claire Bears&lt;/a&gt;, he won the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20League%20%28baseball%2C%201902%E2%80%9371%29\"&gt;Northern League&lt;/a&gt; batting championship with a .344 &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt;. Torre made his major league debut late in the season on September 25, 1960. For the season he was assigned to the Triple A &lt;a href=\"Louisville%20Colonels%20%28minor%20league%20baseball%29\"&gt;Louisville Colonels&lt;/a&gt;, where the Braves planned to groom him as the eventual successor to their &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt; catcher, &lt;a href=\"Del%20Crandall\"&gt;Del Crandall&lt;/a&gt;. However, those plans were changed when Crandall injured his throwing arm in May &lt;a href=\"1961%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the Braves to promote Torre to the major leagues with just over a year of minor league experience. Torre rose to the occasion, hitting for a .278 batting average with 21 &lt;a href=\"Double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubles&lt;/a&gt; and 10 &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s. He finished the season ranked second to &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Williams%20%28left%20fielder%29\"&gt;Billy Williams&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award\"&gt;Rookie of the Year&lt;/a&gt; voting.\nCrandall resumed his role as the number one catcher in &lt;a href=\"1962%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt; while Torre stayed on as the back-up catcher. By the &lt;a href=\"1963%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt; season, the Braves had begun to play Crandall at first base as Torre had taken over the starting catcher's role. He ended the season with a .293 batting average with 14 home runs and 71 runs batted in and, earned a spot as a reserve for the National League team in the &lt;a href=\"1963%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1963 All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;. In December , the Braves traded Crandall to the San Francisco Giants leaving Torre as the undisputed number one catcher.\nTorre had a breakout year in &lt;a href=\"1964%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; when he hit 12 home runs along with a .312 batting average by mid-season and was voted to be the starting catcher for the National League in the &lt;a href=\"1964%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1964 All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;. He ended the season with a .321 batting average, fourth highest in the league, along with 20 home runs and 109 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt; and led National League catchers with a .995 &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that the Braves finished the season in fifth place, Torre ranked fifth in voting for the National League &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;Most Valuable Player Award&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1965%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1965&lt;/a&gt;, Torre won his first of two &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Player%20of%20the%20Month%20Award\"&gt;NL Player of the Month awards&lt;/a&gt; when he took the honour for May, batting .382, with 10 HR, and 24 RBI. Torre was once again voted to be the starting catcher for the National League in the &lt;a href=\"1965%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1965 All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt; and hit a two-run home run off of &lt;a href=\"Milt%20Pappas\"&gt;Milt Pappas&lt;/a&gt; to help the National League to a 6\u20135 victory. He ended the season with 27 home runs and 80 runs batted in although his batting average dipped to .291. Torre won his first and only &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Glove%20Award\"&gt;Gold Glove Award&lt;/a&gt; in 1965 although, baseball historian &lt;a href=\"Bill%20James\"&gt;Bill James&lt;/a&gt; said the decision was influenced by his offensive statistics and that, either &lt;a href=\"John%20Roseboro\"&gt;John Roseboro&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Haller\"&gt;Tom Haller&lt;/a&gt; were more deserved of the award. In an article for the \"St. Petersburg Independent\" that year, &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Generation\"&gt;Beat Generation&lt;/a&gt; author &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Kerouac\"&gt;Jack Kerouac&lt;/a&gt; called Torre \"the best catcher since &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Campanella\"&gt;Roy Campanella&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nFor the &lt;a href=\"1966%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1966&lt;/a&gt; season the Braves relocated to &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; and the new &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%E2%80%93Fulton%20County%20Stadium\"&gt;Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium&lt;/a&gt; which, due to its less dense atmosphere in the high elevation in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, made it favorable to home run hitters, resulting in the nickname \"The Launching Pad\". On April 12, 1966, Torre hit the first major league home run in the history of the Atlanta stadium. Torre produced a career-high 36 home runs with 101 runs batted in, a .315 batting average, a .382 &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt; and, led National League catchers with a 48.6% &lt;a href=\"caught%20stealing\"&gt;caught stealing&lt;/a&gt; percentage. He was voted as the starting catcher for the National League &lt;a href=\"1966%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star team&lt;/a&gt; for the third successive year. His offensive production tapered off in &lt;a href=\"1967%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1967&lt;/a&gt; with a .277 batting average with 68 runs batted in although he still hit 20 home runs and won his fourth consecutive start in the &lt;a href=\"1967%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1967 All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;. He posted another sub-par season in &lt;a href=\"1968%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt; with a .271 batting average, 10 home runs and 55 runs batted in however, he led National League catchers with a .996 fielding percentage.\nBefore the 1969 season, Torre became embroiled in a feud with Braves &lt;a href=\"General%20manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;General Manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Richards%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Paul Richards&lt;/a&gt; over his salary. Eventually, the Braves traded Torre to the St. Louis Cardinals for the Most Valuable Player Award winner, &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Cepeda\"&gt;Orlando Cepeda&lt;/a&gt;.\nSt. Louis Cardinals (1969\u20131974).\nThe Cardinals had &lt;a href=\"Tim%20McCarver\"&gt;Tim McCarver&lt;/a&gt; as their starting catcher so Torre replaced the departed Cepeda as their first baseman for the &lt;a href=\"1969%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt; season. His offensive statistics rebounded and he ended the season with a .289 batting average with 18 home runs and 101 runs batted in. In &lt;a href=\"1970%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt;, the Cardinals traded away McCarver along with &lt;a href=\"Byron%20Browne\"&gt;Byron Browne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Curt%20Flood\"&gt;Curt Flood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Hoerner\"&gt;Joe Hoerner&lt;/a&gt; to the Philadelphia Phillies for &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Allen\"&gt;Dick Allen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Johnson%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Jerry Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cookie%20Rojas\"&gt;Cookie Rojas&lt;/a&gt;. Allen took over as the Cardinals' first baseman while Torre split his playing time between playing third base and sharing catching duties with young prospect &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Simmons\"&gt;Ted Simmons&lt;/a&gt;. His offensive statistics continued to improve; he hit 21 home runs with 100 runs batted in and finished second to &lt;a href=\"Rico%20Carty\"&gt;Rico Carty&lt;/a&gt; in the National League batting championship with a .325 batting average.\nThe Cardinals made Simmons their full-time catcher in &lt;a href=\"1971%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Torre to concentrate on playing third base. Freed from the mentally challenging, strength-sapping job of catching, Torre had a career-season offensively. He was hitting for a .359 batting average at mid-season and was voted to be the starting third baseman for the National League in the &lt;a href=\"1971%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1971 All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;. He was named NL Player of the Month for the second and final time in August (.373, 5 HR, 27 RBI). Torre won the National League &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20batting%20champions\"&gt;Batting Championship&lt;/a&gt;, hitting .363 and led the league with 137 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt;, en route to winning the National League &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;Most Valuable Player&lt;/a&gt; award. Adapting to a new defensive position proved to be a challenge as Torre led the league's third basemen with 21 &lt;a href=\"Error%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;errors&lt;/a&gt;. In December, he was awarded the 1971 &lt;a href=\"Hutch%20Award\"&gt;Hutch Award&lt;/a&gt;, given annually to the player who best exemplifies the fighting spirit and competitive desire of &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Hutchinson\"&gt;Fred Hutchinson&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1972%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt;, Torre won his second consecutive starting role as third baseman for the National League in the &lt;a href=\"1972%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;. However, his offensive numbers for the season dipped to a .289 batting average with 11 home runs and 81 runs batted in. After two more sub-par seasons, the Cardinals traded the 34-year-old Torre to the New York Mets for &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Sadecki\"&gt;Ray Sadecki&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Moore%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Tommy Moore&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew York Mets (1975\u20131977).\nWith the Mets in , Torre became the third player in major league history, and first in the National League, to hit into four &lt;a href=\"double%20play\"&gt;double play&lt;/a&gt;s in one game. &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Mill%C3%A1n\"&gt;Felix Mill\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; singled in all four of his at-bats hitting ahead of Torre, and at a post-game press conference, Torre joked about his own performance by saying \"I'd like to thank F\u00e9lix Mill\u00e1n for making this possible.\" When Torre's batting average fell to .247 in &lt;a href=\"1975%20New%20York%20Mets%20season\"&gt;1975&lt;/a&gt;, it appeared his best years might be behind him. However, his average rebounded 59 points in &lt;a href=\"1976%20New%20York%20Mets%20season\"&gt;1976&lt;/a&gt;, and he finished the year with a .306 batting average. In May &lt;a href=\"1977%20New%20York%20Mets%20season\"&gt;1977&lt;/a&gt;, the Mets fired manager &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Frazier%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Joe Frazier&lt;/a&gt; and named Torre as their player-manager. Because he believed he could not do the job properly while still playing, he decided to retire at age 37. He did serve 18 days as a player-manager (only having 2 at-bats), becoming the second of three players in the 1970s to take on both roles (&lt;a href=\"Frank%20Robinson\"&gt;Frank Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, in the two previous seasons with the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Don%20Kessinger\"&gt;Don Kessinger&lt;/a&gt;, in with the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt;, were the others). His final at bat came on June 17, 1977 at &lt;a href=\"Shea%20Stadium\"&gt;Shea Stadium&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;, where he put himself in as a pinch hitter. But he flied out to right field, thereby ending his playing career.\nPost-playing career.\nNew York Mets manager (1977\u20131981).\nTorre managed the Mets from &lt;a href=\"1977%20New%20York%20Mets%20season\"&gt;1977&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1981%20New%20York%20Mets%20season\"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt; season, but failed to improve the team's record. He went 49\u201368 in his first season with the Mets, while the team finished 64\u201398 overall and in last place in the NL East. The next two seasons weren't any better, going 66-96 and 63-99 respectively. Torre's team improved in 1980 to fifth place, as they finished 67\u201395. The strike-shortened season of 1981 was Torre's last with the team, and he went 17\u201334 in the first half of the season and 24\u201328 in the second half, finishing fifth and fourth. After five years without a winning season, Torre was fired at the end of the strike-shortened season.\nAtlanta Braves manager (1982\u20131984).\nIn &lt;a href=\"1982%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1982&lt;/a&gt;, Torre replaced &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Cox\"&gt;Bobby Cox&lt;/a&gt; as the manager of the Atlanta Braves, and immediately guided them to a Major League-record 13 straight wins to open the season. Atlanta subsequently went on to finish 89\u201373 and capture the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20West\"&gt;National League West&lt;/a&gt; division title, its first playoff appearance since the &lt;a href=\"1969%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;1969 National League Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; (NLCS). In Game 1 of the &lt;a href=\"1982%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;1982 NLCS&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"1982%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, the Braves jumped to a 1\u20130 lead before the game was rain-delayed after four innings and eventually canceled just three outs short of an official game. St. Louis won the rematch and went on to sweep the series. Torre was named the &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;' (AP) Manager of the Year, becoming the first person to win both that and an MVP award.\nThe Braves slipped to second place in &lt;a href=\"1983%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;, but with their 88\u201374 record, won just one fewer game than the previous season, and marked the first consecutive winning seasons for the organization since moving from &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt; in 1966. In &lt;a href=\"1984%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;, Atlanta slipped to 80\u201382 the following season but, again finished runner-up in the division (tied with &lt;a href=\"1984%20Houston%20Astros%20season\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;). Torre was fired after the 1984 season.\nBroadcast booth (1985\u20131990).\nFrom to , Torre worked as a television &lt;a href=\"color%20commentator\"&gt;color commentator&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"California%20Angels\"&gt;California Angels&lt;/a&gt;. Torre also worked as a color commentator for &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Game%20of%20the%20Week\"&gt;\"Game of the Week\"&lt;/a&gt; telecasts alongside &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Randolph\"&gt;Jay Randolph&lt;/a&gt;. While working as a guest analyst for &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"1989%20World%20Series\"&gt;1989 World Series&lt;/a&gt;, Torre was on hand for the &lt;a href=\"1989%20Loma%20Prieta%20earthquake\"&gt;Loma Prieta earthquake&lt;/a&gt; (October 17, ).\nSt. Louis Cardinals manager (1990\u20131995).\nIn &lt;a href=\"1990%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;, Torre replaced the popular &lt;a href=\"Whitey%20Herzog\"&gt;Whitey Herzog&lt;/a&gt; as Cardinals manager and posted a 351\u2013354 record. Though the Cardinals were unable to reach the playoffs during Torre's tenure, they had winning records in each of the three full seasons he spent with the club (excluding the strike-shortened ). Despite a last-place prediction from many commentators, the Cardinals finished in second place and won 84 games in &lt;a href=\"1991%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, Torre's first full season at the helm. His best record was 87\u201375 in &lt;a href=\"1993%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;. Torre was fired in June &lt;a href=\"1995%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt; for his poor record that year as part of a rebuilding project while &lt;a href=\"Anheuser-Busch\"&gt;Anheuser-Busch&lt;/a&gt; prepared to sell the team.\nNew York Yankees manager (1996\u20132007).\nTorre served as the Yankees &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20New%20York%20Yankees%20managers\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20New%20York%20Yankees%20owners%20and%20executives\"&gt;owner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20Steinbrenner\"&gt;George Steinbrenner&lt;/a&gt;. Torre lasted 12 full seasons, managing 1,942 regular-season games, with a won-loss record of 1,173\u2013767. He took the team to the postseason every one of his twelve seasons with the club, winning six American League &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20American%20League%20pennant%20winners\"&gt;pennants&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20World%20Series%20champions\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;. By far the longest tenure for a Yankees manager in the Steinbrenner era, Torre's was the second-longest tenure in club history: only &lt;a href=\"Joe%20McCarthy%20%28manager%29\"&gt;Joe McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; lasted longer. Torre is the only Yankees manager who was born in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.\n1996\u20132005.\nBefore his first game with the Yankees, Torre got off to a rough start. The New York City press (and fans) thought his hiring was a colossal mistake and greeted him with &lt;a href=\"Tabloid%20journalism\"&gt;tabloid&lt;/a&gt; headlines such as \"Clueless Joe.\" Including his three previous jobs, he had been a combined 109 games below .500, and had never won a playoff game in 14 seasons.\nHowever, it was with the Yankees that he enjoyed the greatest success of his managerial career, leading them to the playoffs in each of his 12 seasons (1996\u20132007) with the club. He would eventually become a fan favorite. In , he was named &lt;a href=\"Manager%20of%20the%20Year%20Award\"&gt;Manager of the Year&lt;/a&gt;. Torre, building on the Yankees' &lt;a href=\"Wild%20card%20%28sports%29\"&gt;Wild Card&lt;/a&gt; berth in &lt;a href=\"1995%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;, made his first-ever trip to the \"Fall Classic\", leading the Yankees to their first &lt;a href=\"World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; since . After the Yankees defeated the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;, Steinbrenner tore up Torre's contract and gave him a new, more lucrative and longer contract as a reward.\nOn April 30, , Torre won his 1,000th game as manager, doing so with a 2-1 victory over the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Mariners\"&gt;Seattle Mariners&lt;/a&gt;. The Yankees went into the postseason for the third straight year, albeit as a Wild Card. They lost to the &lt;a href=\"1997%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1997%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;Division Series&lt;/a&gt;. After that, the team would win three straight World Series titles from to , and additional American League pennants in and .\nThe season was Torre's most successful. Despite a slow start that included losing four of the first five games of the season, the Yankees set a then-American League record of 114 regular-season wins, including &lt;a href=\"David%20Wells\"&gt;David Wells&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"David%20Wells%27%20perfect%20game\"&gt;perfect game&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season\"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; on May 17. It was in an August 11 victory over the Twins that Torre evened his career record win\u2013loss record, making it 1168\u20131168. One other manager in Yankees' history, &lt;a href=\"Casey%20Stengel\"&gt;Casey Stengel&lt;/a&gt;, had joined the team with a career record further below .500 than Torre, at 166 games, and eventually reached .500 as Yankees manager.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"1998%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;1998 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, the Yankees easily bested the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Texas%20Rangers%20season\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, fought off the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1998%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;AL pennant&lt;/a&gt;, and swept the &lt;a href=\"1998%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season\"&gt;San Diego Padres&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1998%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;. His club set a major-league record of 125 total wins a season, including regular and postseason, breaking the &lt;a href=\"1906%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season\"&gt;1906 Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;' record of 118. Torre won &lt;a href=\"Manager%20of%20the%20Year%20Award\"&gt;Manager of the Year&lt;/a&gt; honors, and the team is now widely regarded as \"one of the best squads of all time,\" along with the Yankee teams of &lt;a href=\"Murderers%27%20Row\"&gt;1927&lt;/a&gt;, and , the &lt;a href=\"1972%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"1974%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season\"&gt;1974 Oakland Athletics&lt;/a&gt;, and the 1975\u20131976 &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; launched its \"&lt;a href=\"Who%27s%20No.%201%3F\"&gt;Who's#1?&lt;/a&gt;\" series on June 15, , the 1998 Yankees topped the network's list of best teams over the years 1979 to 2003.\nPresiding over his clubs' second &lt;a href=\"David%20Cone%27s%20perfect%20game\"&gt;perfect game&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1999%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, on this occasion, behind starter &lt;a href=\"David%20Cone\"&gt;David Cone&lt;/a&gt;, the Yankees defeated the &lt;a href=\"1999%20Montreal%20Expos%20season\"&gt;Montreal Expos&lt;/a&gt; 6\u20130. The event occurred on July 18, also Torre's 59th birthday. He became the first to manage his teams to two &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20game%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;perfect game&lt;/a&gt; wins, while becoming just the fourth in MLB history to manage his club in two perfect games, joining Stengel (1\u20131), &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Alston\"&gt;Walter Alston&lt;/a&gt; (1\u20131), and &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Lasorda\"&gt;Tommy Lasorda&lt;/a&gt; (0\u20132). The Yankees also won their second consecutive &lt;a href=\"1999%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith a win over &lt;a href=\"2002%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; on May 12, &lt;a href=\"2002%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, Torre became the 17th manager in Major League history to reach the milestone of 1,500 victories.\nIn , Torre suffered his greatest setback, marking the end of the Yankees' dominance. After building a 3\u20130 lead in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;ALCS&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt;, his team would go on to suffer one of the worst collapses in baseball history and lose the next four games and the ALCS. The Red Sox would go on to win the &lt;a href=\"2004%20World%20Series\"&gt;2004 World Series&lt;/a&gt;, their first title since , ending the \"&lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Bambino\"&gt;Curse of the Bambino&lt;/a&gt;\", which was supposedly inflicted on the team when &lt;a href=\"Babe%20Ruth\"&gt;Babe Ruth&lt;/a&gt; was sold to the &lt;a href=\"1920%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;Yankees&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1920%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season\"&gt;1919&lt;/a&gt;.\nOff to an 8\u221211 start in &lt;a href=\"2005%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, the Yankees played their last five months at 84\u221248. They won 14 of their last 18 on their way to employing a franchise record 51 players to overtake Boston and capture their eighth consecutive AL East title. Their season ended in an 5-game &lt;a href=\"2005%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;ALDS&lt;/a&gt; loss to the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim%20season\"&gt;Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim&lt;/a&gt;.\n2006\u20132007.\nDespite pitching issues and injuries, the Yankees won another AL East title in &lt;a href=\"2006%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. The Yankees would go on to lose the &lt;a href=\"2006%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;ALDS&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; in 4 games that season.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2007%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, Torre achieved his 2,000th win to become the first major league employee to win 2000 games as manager and collect 2,000 hits. He later notched his 2,010th managerial win, overtaking &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Durocher\"&gt;Leo Durocher&lt;/a&gt; for ninth place on the MLB all-time managerial wins list. Next, he passed Stengel on the Yankees' all-time managerial wins list in 2007 and recorded his 1,150th victory with the Yankees. Torre led the Yankees to their 13th consecutive postseason appearance.\nAfter two Yankees losses to the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2007%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;Division Series&lt;/a&gt;, Steinbrenner said in an interview that Torre's contract would not be renewed if the Yankees did not defeat the Indians. The Yankees saved their season, and potentially Torre's job, for one day, as they won Game 3 at Yankee Stadium. Following the Yankees' elimination the following night, earning them another first-round exit, Torre's fate remained uncertain. That night, as he went out to make what would be his last pitching change with the team, the fans in Yankee Stadium gave him a standing ovation and chanted his name.\nAfter the season, the Yankees met with Torre and offered him a one-year contract with a $5 million base pay and $1 million bonuses, to be paid for each of three benchmarks the team would reach: winning the &lt;a href=\"American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;American League Division Series&lt;/a&gt;; winning the &lt;a href=\"American%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;American League Championship Series&lt;/a&gt;; and winning the &lt;a href=\"World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;. Further, had the Yankees reached the World Series, that would have automatically triggered an option for a new contract the following year. In spite of a pay cut from an average of $6.4 million over the previous three seasons, the new terms would have kept him as the highest-paid manager in the game.\n&lt;a href=\"Yankee%20Global%20Enterprises\"&gt;Yankee Global Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chairman\"&gt;chairman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hal%20Steinbrenner\"&gt;Hal Steinbrenner&lt;/a&gt; \"explained the rationale behind the offer, which was nonnegotiable.\" Yankees president &lt;a href=\"Randy%20Levine\"&gt;Randy Levine&lt;/a&gt; commented, \"We thought we needed to go with a &lt;a href=\"Performance-based%20regulation\"&gt;performance-based model&lt;/a&gt;. It's important to motivate people based on performance.\" George Steinbrenner, due to advancing age and deteriorating health, had noticeably less influence in the day-to-day operation of the club. Of the ultimatum he issued during the playoffs, his son Hal denied that his comments influenced the terms of the contract they presented to Torre.\nThe New York media portrayed the offer as an insult. Torre turned it down, ending his era with the Yankees. On October 19, 2007, he held a news conference to explain his decision. After first thanking George Steinbrenner, he remarked, \"I just felt the contract offer and the terms of the contract were probably the thing I had the toughest time with.\"\nOf the aftermath, Wallace Matthews of \"&lt;a href=\"Newsday\"&gt;Newsday&lt;/a&gt;\" commented, \"They are very slick, these thugs running the Yankees. ... They have been trying to figure out a way to whack Torre while making it appear as if Torre whacked himself. What they came up with was brilliant in its innovation and chilling in its cynicism, but ultimately transparent.\" Opined &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Lupica\"&gt;Mike Lupica&lt;/a&gt;, \"It was just the most famous disagreement we are ever likely to see in baseball, the most famous manager telling the people who run the most famous team to take their job and shove it. A manager finally fired the Yankees.\" Added &lt;a href=\"Joel%20Sherman%20%28sportswriter%29\"&gt;Joel Sherman&lt;/a&gt;, \"Torre erred in turning down the Yankees' proposal to stay in the position that has made him rich and famous beyond what he could have dreamed a dozen years ago.\" He also walks \"away from that juice as much as the ownership.\"\nOn February 3, 2009, Torre released a book about his experiences with the Yankees, called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Yankee%20Years\"&gt;The Yankee Years&lt;/a&gt;\", co-authored by &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Verducci\"&gt;Tom Verducci&lt;/a&gt;.\nTorre returned to Yankee Stadium for the first time since vacating the Yankees managerial job on September 20, &lt;a href=\"2010%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;, to pay respect to George Steinbrenner on the night of the previous owner's monument being unveiled in &lt;a href=\"Monument%20Park%20%28Yankee%20Stadium%29\"&gt;Monument Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nLos Angeles Dodgers manager (2008\u20132010).\nOn November 1, 2007, the Los Angeles Dodgers announced that Torre would be their &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20managers\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; beginning with the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season\"&gt;2008 season&lt;/a&gt;, filling the void left when &lt;a href=\"Grady%20Little\"&gt;Grady Little&lt;/a&gt; resigned the post two days before. This marked the return of Torre to the National League, the only league he had played or managed in prior to becoming the Yankees skipper. According to ESPN, his contract was valued at $13 million over 3 years.\nTorre brought two members of his 2007 Yankees coaching staff with him. &lt;a href=\"Don%20Mattingly\"&gt;Don Mattingly&lt;/a&gt;, who had served as Torre's &lt;a href=\"bench%20coach\"&gt;bench coach&lt;/a&gt;, was tabbed as the &lt;a href=\"hitting%20coach\"&gt;hitting coach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"third%20base%20coach\"&gt;third base coach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Bowa\"&gt;Larry Bowa&lt;/a&gt; was brought in to fill the same position with the Dodgers. In January 2008, Mattingly was moved to the role of special assignment coach for the 2008 season due to family concerns. He was replaced as hitting coach by &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Easler\"&gt;Mike Easler&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, Torre brought in &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Schaefer\"&gt;Bob Schaefer&lt;/a&gt; to be bench coach, and retained first base coach &lt;a href=\"Mariano%20Duncan\"&gt;Mariano Duncan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pitching%20coach\"&gt;pitching coach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Honeycutt\"&gt;Rick Honeycutt&lt;/a&gt; from Little's staff. &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Howell\"&gt;Ken Howell&lt;/a&gt; was promoted from &lt;a href=\"AAA%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Triple-A&lt;/a&gt; pitching coach to &lt;a href=\"bullpen%20coach\"&gt;bullpen coach&lt;/a&gt;, completing his staff. Torre as a young boy lived in &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; when the Dodgers played there, but admitted to being a &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; fan then, adding another keynote in the longstanding &lt;a href=\"Dodgers%E2%80%93Giants%20rivalry\"&gt;rivalry&lt;/a&gt; between the two clubs.\nOn March 31, &lt;a href=\"2008%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Joe Torre made his managerial debut with the Dodgers in a 5\u20130 victory. Coincidentally, he would be managing several former Red Sox players, such as &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Ramirez\"&gt;Manny Ramirez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Lowe\"&gt;Derek Lowe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nomar%20Garciaparra\"&gt;Nomar Garciaparra&lt;/a&gt;. On September 25, 2008, the Dodgers clinched the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20West\"&gt;National League West&lt;/a&gt; title, giving Torre his 13th consecutive postseason appearance. October 4, 2008 saw Torre managing the Dodgers to a 3\u20130 victory over the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2008%20National%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;National League Division Series&lt;/a&gt;, earning the Dodgers their first post-season series victory since their &lt;a href=\"1988%20World%20Series\"&gt;championship&lt;/a&gt; season of &lt;a href=\"1988%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;. Torre's Dodgers were beaten in the &lt;a href=\"2008%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;NLCS&lt;/a&gt; four games to one by the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;Phillies&lt;/a&gt; (who went on to win the &lt;a href=\"2008%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;) with a 5\u20131 loss on October 15.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2009%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, Torre served as a coach on manager &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Manuel\"&gt;Charlie Manuel&lt;/a&gt;'s staff in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"2009%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; achieved the National League's best record (95\u201367), clinching the top seed. They faced Torre's old club, the &lt;a href=\"2009%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20National%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;National League Division Series&lt;/a&gt;, sweeping them in three games. However, they went on to lose to the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;NLCS&lt;/a&gt; in five games, ending their second consecutive season with a loss to the Phillies. (The Phillies, however, lost to his former team, the &lt;a href=\"2009%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;Yankees&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20World%20Series\"&gt;2009 World Series&lt;/a&gt;.)\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;2010 season&lt;/a&gt;, Torre and his Dodgers played games against both the &lt;a href=\"2010%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;Yankees&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season\"&gt;Red Sox&lt;/a&gt;. The Dodgers managed to only go 1\u20135 against the two teams. It was the first time ever he had faced the Yankees and the first time he had faced the Sox since leaving the Yankees.\nOn September 17, 2010, Torre announced he would step down as Dodgers manager after the 2010 season, with &lt;a href=\"Don%20Mattingly\"&gt;Don Mattingly&lt;/a&gt; being Torre's replacement for the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; campaign.\nOn October 3, 2010, the Dodgers defeated the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Arizona%20Diamondbacks%20season\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131 at Dodger Stadium for Torre's 2,326th career win. The victory was his last one with the Dodgers, since he stepped down as the team's manager at the conclusion of the game.\nCommissioner's office (2011\u2013present).\nWith a desire to stay highly active post-field managing in spite of his advancing age, Torre accepted a position assisting Major League Baseball &lt;a href=\"Commissioner%20of%20Baseball\"&gt;Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bud%20Selig\"&gt;Bud Selig&lt;/a&gt; as the new Executive Vice President for Baseball Operations on February 26, 2011. His stated duties according to the &lt;a href=\"MLB.com\"&gt;MLB.com&lt;/a&gt; biography include serving as the primary liaison for all baseball and on-field activities between the office of the commissioner and the &lt;a href=\"General%20manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;general managers&lt;/a&gt; and field managers of all 30 Major League clubs. Other duties include overseeing areas of major league operations, on-field operations and discipline and &lt;a href=\"Umpire%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;umpiring&lt;/a&gt;. In December 2014, as part of an executive reorganization, MLB announced Torre's title was modified to Chief Baseball Officer, although his duties remained the same.\nTorre drew criticism when, during the 10th anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks\"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt;, MLB denied the &lt;a href=\"2011%20New%20York%20Mets%20season\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; the right to wear tribute caps to &lt;a href=\"first%20responder\"&gt;first responder&lt;/a&gt;s, like they did in the month following the attacks.\nTorre briefly resigned from his position with Major League Baseball in January 2012 amid speculation that he was interested in joining one of the groups seeking to buy the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;.
