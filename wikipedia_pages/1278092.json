Methodist students constitute 27 percent of the student population. Ninety five percent of students are &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Minority%20group\"&gt;Minority&lt;/a&gt; groups make up approximately one-fourth of the student body. In the &lt;a href=\"freshman\"&gt;freshman&lt;/a&gt; class, 98 percent of students receive some &lt;a href=\"Student%20financial%20aid%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;financial aid&lt;/a&gt;. Fifty-three percent of students live on campus, and 75 percent of students are involved in at least one &lt;a href=\"extracurricular%20activity\"&gt;extracurricular activity&lt;/a&gt;. McMurry boasts a student to faculty ratio of 13:1.\n91 percent of the &lt;a href=\"Faculty%20%28teaching%20staff%29\"&gt;faculty&lt;/a&gt; have earned a &lt;a href=\"doctorate\"&gt;doctorate&lt;/a&gt; or other terminal degree in their field. McMurry is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Education%20Agency\"&gt;Texas Education Agency&lt;/a&gt;, the University Senate of the United Methodist Church, the National League for Nursing, and the Texas State Board of Nurse Examiners.\nIndians mascot controversy.\nMcMurry's sports teams originally used Indians as their nickname. In late August 2005, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (NCAA) handed down a decision calling for the eighteen universities with &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mascot\"&gt;mascot&lt;/a&gt;s to change their names or obtain a waiver from their representative tribe for the use of the mascot name. The McMurry Indians were part of this list. The Indians nickname was chosen as a tribute to the University's first president, &lt;a href=\"J.W.%20Hunt\"&gt;J.W. Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, who grew up on an Indian Reservation in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Territory\"&gt;Indian Territory&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn May 18, 2006, the NCAA rejected McMurry's appeal to keep their nickname. The school chose to appeal the ruling, and indicated their intention to do so by the June 18, 2006, deadline. According to a press release, \"the University\u2019s appeal will be based on the arbitrariness of the NCAA\u2019s decision-making process and the inconsistent results and messages that have come from the process.\" Other schools, such as &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20University\"&gt;Florida State University&lt;/a&gt;, made successful appeals by garnering the endorsement of Indian tribes. Although McMurry did not actively seek an endorsement, representatives from the &lt;a href=\"Kaw%20%28tribe%29\"&gt;Kaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kiowa\"&gt;Kiowa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Comanche\"&gt;Comanche&lt;/a&gt; tribes voiced their approval of McMurry's mascot. In October 2006, McMurry's Board of Trustees decided that the university would no longer use any names for its athletic teams. Citing the school's 83-year history of honoring Native Americans, the school announced that in spite of no longer using names to designate athletic teams, the school traditions created to honor Native Americans would continue. The school's stadium name was changed from Indian Stadium to &lt;a href=\"Wilford%20Moore%20Stadium\"&gt;Wilford Moore Stadium&lt;/a&gt; as of May 13, 2007. &lt;a href=\"Wilford%20Moore\"&gt;Wilford Moore&lt;/a&gt; was the most-winning coach in McMurry football history.\nOn March 11, 2011, it was announced that McMurry University's athletic teams would be known as the War Hawks. The new mascot was chosen after a nearly year-long search to find a new mascot to replace the former Indian mascot. The war hawk is meant to represent pride, courage and fierce competition for McMurry's athletic teams.\nAthletics.\nMcMurry's school colors are &lt;a href=\"Maroon%20%28color%29\"&gt;maroon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"White%20%28color%29\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;. McMurry fields teams in 19 different intercollegiate sports. For the men, McMurry competes in &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cross%20country%20running\"&gt;cross country&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soccer\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"swimming%20%28sport%29\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, Esports, and indoor and outdoor &lt;a href=\"track%20and%20field\"&gt;track and field&lt;/a&gt;.

In July 2011, McMurry announced that it had been accepted as a candidate for &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20II\"&gt;NCAA Division II&lt;/a&gt; membership and joined the &lt;a href=\"Heartland%20Conference\"&gt;Heartland Conference&lt;/a&gt; in the fall of 2012.\nThe Board of Regent voted in January 2014 to move back to Division III.\nThe McMurry football team joined the &lt;a href=\"Lone%20Star%20Conference\"&gt;Lone Star Conference&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.\nMcMurry University announced October 19, 2016 that the sport of softball would be added to its women's intercollegiate programs, beginning in 2018. The addition of softball would bring to 20 the number of sports sponsored by the War Hawks. Softball sponsorship in the ASC would grow to 13 teams and becomes the seventh conference championship sport to be supported at every member institution. Women's soccer, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's tennis, and baseball are ASC sports sponsored by all ASC members. By conference rule and with full member sponsorship of softball, the ASC Softball Championship Tournament format would shift to eight-team double-elimination with the 2018 tournament.\nWalt Driggers Field.\nWalt Driggers Field is the home of the McMurry War Hawks collegiate baseball program. The field was designed and built by Anglea Sports Fields, which is headed by former &lt;a href=\"Globe%20Life%20Park%20in%20Arlington\"&gt;Globe Life Park in Arlington&lt;/a&gt; superintendent Jim Anglea. McMurry played its first game at Walt Driggers Field on February 12, 1997 with a 7-3 win against &lt;a href=\"Wayland%20Baptist%20Pioneers%20baseball\"&gt;Wayland Baptist Pioneers&lt;/a&gt;. The school officially renamed the field before a home game against the &lt;a href=\"Lubbock%20Christian%20Chaparrals%20baseball\"&gt;Lubbock Christian Chaparrals&lt;/a&gt; shortly thereafter."
