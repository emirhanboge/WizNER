    "text": "Stalin's Disciples (, in Hebrew Stalin's Children) is a 1986 Israeli film directed by &lt;a href=\"Nadav%20Levitan\"&gt;Nadav Levitan&lt;/a&gt; that satirizes the &lt;a href=\"utopian\"&gt;utopian&lt;/a&gt; ideology of the Israeli &lt;a href=\"kibbutz\"&gt;kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nThe death of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s leads to an ideological crisis on a &lt;a href=\"kibbutz\"&gt;kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; that identifies with &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; principles. The blind faith of three elderly shoemakers, who previously abused a young boy daring to criticize Stalin, begins to disintegrate when they learn of the Soviet leader's crimes and the manifest &lt;a href=\"antisemitism\"&gt;antisemitism&lt;/a&gt; on display at the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Trials\"&gt;Prague Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritical reception.\nThe film was screened in the &lt;a href=\"Un%20Certain%20Regard\"&gt;Un Certain Regard&lt;/a&gt; section at the &lt;a href=\"1988%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;1988 Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Although it was both a critical and commercial failure, it was nominated for a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Globe%20Award\"&gt;Golden Globe Award&lt;/a&gt; and was the first Israeli feature to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; Film Festivals.\nYehuda (Judd) Neeman, a film researcher and director, has said that \"Stalin's Disciples\" (actually in Hebrew \"Stalin's Children\") was \"the first film to look ironically at Stalinism and the kibbutz movement. . . &lt;a href=\"Nadav%20Levitan\"&gt;Nadav Levitan&lt;/a&gt; took characters from the actual fabric of the kibbutz he knew, including the sandal workshop with Stalin's picture on the wall, and little by little wove the pieces together. Blind worship for Stalin and unshaken belief in the Soviet Union was disintegrating on the kibbutz, partly triggered by 1952 Prague arrest and confession under torture of spying for British intelligence against Communist states by far left &lt;a href=\"Hashomer%20Hatzair\"&gt;Hashomer Hatzair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mapam\"&gt;Mapam&lt;/a&gt; functionary &lt;a href=\"Mordechai%20Oren\"&gt;Mordechai Oren&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mizra\"&gt;Kibbutz Mizra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the film there is the charming moment when one of the heroes looks at the sky, doesn't believe that this era has ended, looks at the moon and instead of seeing the crescent, sees the hammer and sickle. In my eyes, this is a brilliant cinematic touch and also a statement of political film, which was at its peak here in those days.\""
