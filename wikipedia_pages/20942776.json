    "text": "Wahdat an-Nidal (, 'Unity of the Struggle') was a &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; group in &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, known by the publication it issued under that name in Arabic and &lt;a href=\"Kurdish%20language\"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt;. The group emerged in September 1944 through the merger of the \"&lt;a href=\"Ila%20al-Aman\"&gt;Ila al-Aman&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Shararah\"&gt;Shararah&lt;/a&gt;\" factions. \nIn 1945 the Arab section of \"Wahdat an-Nidal\" dissolved itself and its members joined the &lt;a href=\"Iraqi%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Iraqi Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; (the Communist Party had refused to merge with the group, instead demanding that the group dissolve, deposition its literature and printing equipment with the party and its members join the part as individuals). The Kurdish section refused to disband itself, and converted itself into the \"&lt;a href=\"Shursh\"&gt;Shursh&lt;/a&gt;\" group."
