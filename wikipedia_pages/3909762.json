    "text": "A prayer book is a book containing &lt;a href=\"prayer\"&gt;prayer&lt;/a&gt;s and perhaps devotional readings, for private or communal use, or in some cases, outlining the liturgy of religious services. Books containing mainly orders of religious services, or readings for them are termed \"service books\" or \"&lt;a href=\"liturgical%20book\"&gt;liturgical book&lt;/a&gt;s\", and are thus not prayer-books in the strictest sense, but the term is often used very loosely. &lt;a href=\"Breviary\"&gt;Breviaries&lt;/a&gt; are prayer books used in many Christian denominations by believers to &lt;a href=\"Christian%20prayer\"&gt;pray&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"fixed%20prayer%20times\"&gt;fixed prayer times&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"canonical%20hours\"&gt;canonical hours&lt;/a&gt; seven times a day, a practice that has its roots in . Throughout the year, and especially during certain seasons of the Christian &lt;a href=\"liturgical%20year\"&gt;liturgical kalendar&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Advent\"&gt;Advent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lent\"&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt;, many Christians pray a &lt;a href=\"daily%20devotional\"&gt;daily devotional&lt;/a&gt;, which contains a prayer for each day along with a reflection on a passage from the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Bible\"&gt;Christian Bible&lt;/a&gt;. A religion's &lt;a href=\"scripture\"&gt;scripture&lt;/a&gt;s might also be considered prayer books as well.\nThe following are among the many books to which the term may loosely refer in various churches or religions, although in strict usage a prayer book is likely to mean a miscellaneous book of prayers as opposed to the standard service books as listed in the last group below:\nActual prayer books:\n\"General\"\n\"Breviaries\"\nService &amp; liturgical books:"
