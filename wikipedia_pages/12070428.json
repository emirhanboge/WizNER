    "text": "Jakob Nufer was a &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; pig-gelder who, around &lt;a href=\"1500%20in%20science\"&gt;1500&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly performed the first successful &lt;a href=\"Caesarean%20section\"&gt;Caesarean section&lt;/a&gt; in history in which the mother (his wife) survived.\nHis wife allegedly bore five more children, including twins, and the baby delivered by Caesarean section purportedly lived to the age of 77.\nHowever, the story was not recorded until 1582 and many historians question its accuracy."
