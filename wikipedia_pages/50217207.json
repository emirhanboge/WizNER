One statue is installed in the &lt;a href=\"Tiergarten%20%28park%29\"&gt;Tiergarten&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, Germany. Others are installed in &lt;a href=\"Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, and &lt;a href=\"Perth\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, Western Australia. The statue is of a barefooted man in a robe, cupping his hands to his mouth as if shouting, and is dedicated to victims and survivors of &lt;a href=\"torture\"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt;."
