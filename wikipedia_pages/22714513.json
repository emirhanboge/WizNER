    "text": "The 57th Infantry Division \"Lombardia\" () was an &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Italian%20Army\"&gt;Royal Italian Army&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The Lombardia was formed on 24 May 1939 in &lt;a href=\"Pula\"&gt;Pula&lt;/a&gt; and named for the region of &lt;a href=\"Lombardy\"&gt;Lombardy&lt;/a&gt;. The division was disbanded by the Germans after the &lt;a href=\"Armistice%20of%20Cassibile\"&gt;Armistice of Cassibile&lt;/a&gt; was announced on 8 September 1943.\nHistory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Second Italian War of Independence&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian Empire&lt;/a&gt; had to cede the &lt;a href=\"Lombardy\"&gt;Lombardy&lt;/a&gt; region of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lombardy%E2%80%93Venetia\"&gt;Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sardinia\"&gt;Kingdom of Sardinia&lt;/a&gt;. After taking control of the region the government of Sardinia ordered on 29 August 1859 that the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Sardinian%20Army\"&gt;Royal Sardinian Army&lt;/a&gt; should raise five infantry brigades and one grenadier brigade in Lombardy. Subsequently on 1 November 1859 the Brigade \"Granatieri di Lombardia\" was activated with the newly raised 3rd and 4th grenadier regiments. On 5 March 1871 the brigade was assigned to the infantry and renamed Brigade \"Lombardia\". On the same date brigade's two regiments were renamed 73rd Infantry Regiment and 74th Infantry Regiment.\nWorld War I.\nThe brigade fought on the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Italian front&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. On 20 October 1926 the brigade assumed the name of IV Infantry Brigade and received the 26th Infantry Regiment \"Bergamo\" from the disbanded &lt;a href=\"15th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BBergamo%26quot%3B\"&gt;Brigade \"Bergamo\"&lt;/a&gt;. The XV Infantry Brigade was the infantry component of the 15th Territorial Division of &lt;a href=\"Pula\"&gt;Pola&lt;/a&gt;, which also included the 4th Artillery Regiment. On 25 January 1930 the division moved to &lt;a href=\"Volosko\"&gt;Volosko&lt;/a&gt; and consequently changed its name to 15th Territorial Division of Volosca. On 24 March 1932 the division moved to &lt;a href=\"Opatija\"&gt;Opatija&lt;/a&gt; and changed its name to 15th Territorial Division of Abbazia. In 1934 the division changed its name to 15th Infantry Division \"&lt;a href=\"Carnaro\"&gt;Carnaro&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOn 24 May 1939 the 73rd Infantry Regiment \"Lombardia\" in &lt;a href=\"Rijeka\"&gt;Rijeka&lt;/a&gt; changed its name to 25th Infantry Regiment \"Bergamo\", while the 12th Infantry Regiment \"Casale\" of the &lt;a href=\"12th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BSassari%26quot%3B\"&gt;12th Infantry Division \"Sassari\"&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; changed its name to 73rd Infantry Regiment \"Lombardia\". On the same date the 15th Infantry Division \"&lt;a href=\"Carnaro\"&gt;Carnaro&lt;/a&gt;\" was renamed 15th Infantry Division \"Bergamo\" and ceded the 74th Infantry Regiment \"Lombardia\" to the newly activated 57th Infantry Division \"Lombardia\", which also received the 73rd Infantry Regiment \"Lombardia\" from the 12th Infantry Division \"Sassari\" and the newly raised 57th Artillery Regiment.\nWorld War II.\nThe Lombardia remained at its garrisions until April 1941, when the division participated in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Invasion of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"V%20Army%20Corps%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;V Army Corps&lt;/a&gt;. On 8 April 1941 the division entered combat and on 11 April 1941 it broke through the Yugoslavian defences and crossed the border in the &lt;a href=\"Sora%20%28river%29\"&gt;Sora&lt;/a&gt; river valley. On 12 April 1941 the Lombardia captured Podkilavac, Grobnik (near &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cavle\"&gt;\u010cavle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jelenje\"&gt;Jelenje&lt;/a&gt;. By 13 April 1941 it had reached &lt;a href=\"Krasica\"&gt;Krasica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0krljevo\"&gt;\u0160krljevo&lt;/a&gt;, at which point the Yugoslavian army ceased to offer resistance. On 15 April 1941, garrisons in coastal towns of &lt;a href=\"Novi%20Vinodolski\"&gt;Novi Vinodolski&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Crikvenica\"&gt;Crikvenica&lt;/a&gt;, and as far south as &lt;a href=\"%C5%BDuta%20Lokva\"&gt;\u017duta Lokva&lt;/a&gt; were established. From 9 October to 9 November 1941 the Lombardia participated in the anti-partisan &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Uzice\"&gt;Operation Uzice&lt;/a&gt; on the Serbo-Croatian border. By 1942 the division's main garrisons were in western &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Gerovo\"&gt;Gerovo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Delnice\"&gt;Delnice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ogulin\"&gt;Ogulin&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhile the 57th Infantry Division \"Lombardia\" was on occupation duty in Yugoslavia the division's &lt;a href=\"regimental%20depot\"&gt;regimental depot&lt;/a&gt;s in Italy raised the &lt;a href=\"157th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BNovara%26quot%3B\"&gt;157th Infantry Division \"Novara\"&lt;/a&gt;: the 73rd Infantry Regiment \"Lombardia\" raised the 153rd Infantry Regiment \"Novara\", the 74th Infantry Regiment \"Lombardia\" raised the 154th Infantry Regiment \"Novara\", and the 57th Artillery Regiment \"Lombardia\" raised the 157th Artillery Regiment \"Novara\".\nIn early 1943 the division also participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Neretva\"&gt;Battle of the Neretva&lt;/a&gt;. By that time partisan activity had grown in frequency and scale, and by September 1943 partisans routinely performed battalion-sized attacks on Italian checkpoints and railways. After the &lt;a href=\"Armistice%20of%20Cassibile\"&gt;Armistice of Cassibile&lt;/a&gt; was announced on 8 September 1943, the Lombardia was disbanded by &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Achse\"&gt;invading German forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization.\nAttached to the division from late 1940 to early 1941:\nAttached to the division from early 1941:\nAttached to the division in June 1943:\nCommanding officers.\nThe division's commanding officers were:\nCROWCASS.\nThe names of 14 men attached to the division can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Registry%20of%20War%20Criminals%20and%20Security%20Suspects\"&gt;Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects&lt;/a&gt; (CROWCASS) set up by the Anglo-American &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; in 1945.
