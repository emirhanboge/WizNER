    "text": "Minted is an online marketplace of independent artists and designers. The company &lt;a href=\"crowdsource\"&gt;crowdsource&lt;/a&gt;s art and &lt;a href=\"graphic%20design\"&gt;graphic design&lt;/a&gt; through monthly design challenges. The public votes for the winning entries, and Minted produces the winning work as &lt;a href=\"stationery\"&gt;stationery&lt;/a&gt;, wall art, and decor.\nHistory.\nMinted was founded in April 2007 by &lt;a href=\"Mariam%20Naficy\"&gt;Mariam Naficy&lt;/a&gt; to sell high-end lines of stationery and adopted a crowdsourcing model when it realized that designs by independent artists were outselling those of established brands. Minted has raised nearly $90 million from investors, including &lt;a href=\"Norwest%20Venture%20Partners\"&gt;Norwest Venture Partners&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Technology%20Crossover%20Ventures\"&gt;Technology Crossover Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benchmark%20Capital\"&gt;Benchmark Capital&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Fenton%20%28venture%20capitalist%29\"&gt;Peter Fenton&lt;/a&gt;, IDG Ventures, former &lt;a href=\"Yahoo\"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; CEO &lt;a href=\"Marissa%20Mayer\"&gt;Marissa Mayer&lt;/a&gt;, Yelp CEO &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Stoppelman\"&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eventbrite\"&gt;Eventbrite&lt;/a&gt; founders Kevin and Julia Hartz.\nIn 2012, Minted expanded outside of its core stationery market by launching wall art prints and party decor. \nIn 2015, Minted launched make-on-demand home decor. \nIt partnered with Every Mother Counts, a &lt;a href=\"maternal%20health\"&gt;maternal health&lt;/a&gt; nonprofit organization led by &lt;a href=\"Christy%20Turlington%20Burns\"&gt;Christy Turlington Burns&lt;/a&gt;, in which a part of the proceeds from selling customized children's art would go to benefit the organization.\nMinted Local, a pop-up store in San Francisco\u2019s Union Square shopping district, was opened in May 2016. The store's \u201cStylist Bar\u201d provides access to a Minted expert by appointment for help designing wedding stationery, birth announcements, holiday cards and more. \nCrowdsourcing.\nMinted holds regular design challenges that are open to artists and designers. Thousands of independent artists participate in the challenges. More than 2,000 designs are submitted by artists to Minted every week. \nVisitors to the website vote on the design submissions to help choose the winning designs that will be sold on the website. Minted's predictive voting algorithms use consumer votes to predict which of the thousands of submissions from the contest will be future bestsellers.\nWinning artists are paid a cash prize and earn an ongoing &lt;a href=\"Commission%20%28remuneration%29\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt; on sales of their designs.\nAwards.\nIn October 2014, Minted was named #5 on &lt;a href=\"LinkedIn\"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;'s 10 &lt;a href=\"Bay%20Area\"&gt;Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; startups that are most in demand by local techies."
