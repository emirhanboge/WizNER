    "text": "The 2021 Open Championship, officially the 149th &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;Open Championship&lt;/a&gt;, was a &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; tournament played 15\u201318 July at &lt;a href=\"Royal%20St%20George%27s%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Royal St George's Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sandwich%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Sandwich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally scheduled for 16\u201319 July 2020, but was cancelled due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. It was the 15th Open Championship at Royal St George's, and the first since &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Clarke\"&gt;Darren Clarke&lt;/a&gt; won in &lt;a href=\"2011%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe championship was won by &lt;a href=\"Collin%20Morikawa\"&gt;Collin Morikawa&lt;/a&gt; with a score of 265, 15-under-par, two strokes ahead of &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Spieth\"&gt;Jordan Spieth&lt;/a&gt;. Morikawa became the first player to win on his Open Championship debut since &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Curtis%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Ben Curtis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2003%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, also at Royal St George's. He also became the first male golfer to win two majors on debut \u2013 backing up his 2020 PGA Championship success.\n&lt;a href=\"Lee%20Westwood\"&gt;Lee Westwood&lt;/a&gt; broke &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Haas\"&gt;Jay Haas&lt;/a&gt;'s record of playing in the most majors without a win, with 88.\nOrganisation.\nThe Open Championship was organised by &lt;a href=\"the%20R%26amp%3BA\"&gt;the R&amp;A&lt;/a&gt;, and was included in the &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Tour\"&gt;PGA Tour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"European%20Tour\"&gt;European Tour&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Golf%20Tour\"&gt;Japan Golf Tour&lt;/a&gt; calendars under the &lt;a href=\"Men%27s%20major%20golf%20championships\"&gt;major championships&lt;/a&gt; category. The tournament was a 72-hole (4 rounds) &lt;a href=\"stroke%20play\"&gt;stroke play&lt;/a&gt; competition held over 4 days, with 18 holes played each day. Play was in groups of three for the first two days, and groups of two in the final two days. Groupings for the first two days were decided by the organisers, with each group having one morning, and one afternoon tee time. On the final two days, players teed off in reverse order of aggregate score, with the leaders last. After 36 holes there was a &lt;a href=\"cut%20%28golf%29\"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt;, after which the top 70 and ties progressed through to compete in the third and fourth rounds. In the event of a tie for the lowest score after four rounds, a three-hole aggregate &lt;a href=\"playoff%20%28golf%29\"&gt;playoff&lt;/a&gt; would be held to determine the winner; this would be followed by sudden-death extra holes if necessary until a winner emerged.\nThe previous record for attendance at Royal St George's was 183,000 but organisers expected the 2020 edition to exceed 200,000. Friday, Saturday and Sunday tickets sold out well in advance, with a few Thursday tickets still to be sold. With COVID-19 restrictions in place, up to 32,000 fans were allowed to attend each day of the tournament. \nCancellation in 2020.\nIn March 2020, &lt;a href=\"The%20R%26amp%3BA\"&gt;The R&amp;A&lt;/a&gt; released a statement regarding the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, stating they were examining a range of scenarios for staging the championships, with the focus on proceeding as planned, but also considering other available contingency options. On 6 April, the R&amp;A announced the Championship was cancelled for 2020; it was the first time since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; that the event was not held. Only the Open Championships for men (Open and Senior Open) were not played; the Women's Open was played behind closed doors.\nVenue.\nThe 2021 Open Championship was the 149th edition of the tournament and was held at &lt;a href=\"Royal%20St%20George%27s%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Royal St George's Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in &lt;a href=\"Sandwich%20Bay%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Sandwich Bay&lt;/a&gt;, a long sweeping inlet of the sea between &lt;a href=\"Ramsgate\"&gt;Ramsgate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deal%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Deal&lt;/a&gt;, on the east coast of &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The coastal area consists of sand flats with their associated salt marshes and coastal sand dunes. These conditions are well suited to &lt;a href=\"Links%20%28golf%29\"&gt;links golf&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Prince%27s%20Golf%20Club%2C%20Sandwich\"&gt;Prince's Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; (1932) and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Cinque%20Ports%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; (1909, 1920), both previous Open venues, found immediately north and south of St George's.\nIn preparation for the Open Championship, Royal St George's tasked golf course architects Mackenzie and Ebert to make alterations to the course. Large bunkers at the 4th and 7th holes, and a large bare sand area to the left of the 5th hole, were restored. Two bunkers to the left of the 17th green were replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Swale%20%28landform%29\"&gt;swale&lt;/a&gt; and bunkering was altered on the 18th hole. Improvements were also made to the practice facilities.\nRoyal St George's is the only venue on the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20The%20Open%20Championship%20venues\"&gt;current rota&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Southern%20England\"&gt;Southern England&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 tournament was the 15th edition held at the venue, having first hosted in &lt;a href=\"1894%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;1894&lt;/a&gt;, when it became the first club outside &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; to host the championship. The previous edition held at the venue was in &lt;a href=\"2011%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;, won by &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Clarke\"&gt;Darren Clarke&lt;/a&gt;. The closest large city is &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, about west-northwest.\nTo accommodate for the tournament, the &lt;a href=\"Sandwich%20railway%20station\"&gt;local station&lt;/a&gt; had the platforms extended to accommodate 12-carriage trains. There is a dedicated camping and glamping area, called The Open Camping Village, with a capacity for 2,200 people. The local town had a &lt;a href=\"Sandwich%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Sandwich&lt;/a&gt; in bloom initiative to try to encourage much more tourist activity than in 2011.\nCourse layout.\nLengths of the course for previous Opens (since 1950)\nField.\nThe Open Championship field was made up of 156 players, who gained entry through various exemption criteria and qualifying tournaments. The criteria included past Open champions, recent major winners, top ranked players in the &lt;a href=\"Official%20World%20Golf%20Ranking\"&gt;world rankings&lt;/a&gt; and from the leading world tours, and winners and high finishers from various designated tournaments, including the Open Qualifying Series; the winners of designated amateur events, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Amateur%20Championship\"&gt;The Amateur Championship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Amateur\"&gt;U.S. Amateur&lt;/a&gt;, also gained exemption provided they remain an amateur. Anyone not qualifying via exemption, and had a handicap of 0.4 or lower, could gain entry through regional and final qualifying events.\nCriteria and exemptions.\nEach player is classified according to the first category in which he qualified, but other categories are shown in parentheses.

Final Qualifying\nReserves added to the field.\nOpen Qualifying Series.\nThe Open Qualifying Series (OQS) for the 2020 Open Championship was to consist of twelve events from the six major tours, however only four events took place prior to cancellation of the Open in 2020. The 13 players who had qualified from these four events retained their eligibility for 2021.

In the event of ties, positions went to players ranked highest according to that week's &lt;a href=\"Official%20World%20Golf%20Ranking\"&gt;OWGR&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinal Qualifying.\nIn 2020, thirteen regional qualifying events were scheduled to be held at Alwoodley, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Burhill, Caldy, Fairhaven, Frilford Heath, Kedleston Park, Minchinhampton, Moor Park, Northamptonshire County, and Rochester &amp; Cobham Park in England, Panmure in Scotland, and County Louth in Republic of Ireland|Ireland.

The announcement also confirmed that least eight places would be available through final qualifying. In May, the number of available places was increased to the usual twelve.\nThe Final Qualifying events were played on 29 June at four courses. Three qualifying places were available at each location, with 72 golfers competing at each.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, 15 July 2021\"\n&lt;a href=\"Louis%20Oosthuizen\"&gt;Louis Oosthuizen&lt;/a&gt;, the 2010 champion and runner-up in the previous two majors, opened with seven straight pars before making six birdies in a span of nine holes. He shot a bogey-free 64 (\u22126) and took a one-shot lead after the first round.\n&lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Spieth\"&gt;Jordan Spieth&lt;/a&gt; was one-over on the round before making four straight birdies on the front-nine. After making birdie on both the 15th and 16th, he finished with a round of 65 (\u22125) to tie &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Harman\"&gt;Brian Harman&lt;/a&gt; for second place.\nFive Englishmen were inside the top-10 after 18 holes, including 2019 runner-up &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Fleetwood\"&gt;Tommy Fleetwood&lt;/a&gt;, who birdied the last hole to shoot three-under 67 and join a 10-way tie for ninth place. Defending champion &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Lowry%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Shane Lowry&lt;/a&gt; had a one-over 71, as did &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Clarke\"&gt;Darren Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, who won the last time the Open was held at Royal St George's in 2011.\n&lt;a href=\"Phil%20Mickelson\"&gt;Phil Mickelson&lt;/a&gt;, winner of the &lt;a href=\"2021%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt; two months earlier and the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;2013 Open&lt;/a&gt; champion, had a 10-over 80, his worst score at this tournament since 1998, and finished the round tied for last place. &lt;a href=\"Lin%20Yuxin\"&gt;Lin Yuxin&lt;/a&gt; was the leading amateur after a round of 69.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, 16 July 2021\"\nFirst-round leader &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Oosthuizen\"&gt;Louis Oosthuizen&lt;/a&gt; set a 36-hole Open Championship scoring record after a round of 65 (\u22125). After consecutive birdies on holes 12 and 13, Oosthuizen eagled the par-five 14th to go six-under on his round and open a three-shot lead. He bogeyed the 16th, his first bogey of the tournament, before finishing with pars on the final two holes to post 11-under. His total of 129 broke by one shot the previous 36-hole scoring record, first set by &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Faldo\"&gt;Nick Faldo&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 and &lt;a href=\"Brandt%20Snedeker\"&gt;Brandt Snedeker&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.\n&lt;a href=\"Collin%20Morikawa\"&gt;Collin Morikawa&lt;/a&gt;, making his Open debut, had seven birdies and only one bogey in a six-under round of 64. He led by three shots after finishing his round in the morning before being passed by Oosthuizen in the afternoon, ending up two shots back at nine-under. &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Spieth\"&gt;Jordan Spieth&lt;/a&gt; was tied for the lead after being four-under through 12 holes before a bogey on the 15th dropped him back to eight-under following a round of 67 (\u22123).\n&lt;a href=\"Matti%20Schmid\"&gt;Matti Schmid&lt;/a&gt; had a second-round 65 to equal the record for the lowest round by an amateur in the Open Championship; a record set by &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Lewis%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Tom Lewis&lt;/a&gt; in 2011, also at Royal St George's. Schmid had an opening-round 74, leaving him on 139 after two rounds, 1-under-par. &lt;a href=\"Lin%20Yuxin\"&gt;Lin Yuxin&lt;/a&gt; was the other amateur to make the cut, after a second round 72.\n77 players made the 36-hole cut at 141 (+1).

Oosthuizen began the round with six pars before making a birdie on the seventh and ninth holes to open a two-shot lead at 13-under-par. At the par-three 11th, he failed to get up-and-down after missing the green with his tee shot for his first bogey of the round. Right of the green on the 13th, he left his chip shot short and made his second bogey in three holes to fall back into a tie for the lead. He made a birdie on the par-three 16th with an approach shot within eight feet, finishing the round at 12-under-par and with a one-shot lead.\n&lt;a href=\"Collin%20Morikawa\"&gt;Collin Morikawa&lt;/a&gt;, two behind at the start of the round, was two-over-par for his first five holes before coming back with a birdie on the par-five seventh and another from 25 feet on the eighth hole. He made another long birdie putt on the 13th and tapped in for birdie on the par-five 14th after reaching the green in two, making a two-under 68 and ending up at 11-under-par.\n&lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Spieth\"&gt;Jordan Spieth&lt;/a&gt; made five birdies in his first 10 holes and was part of a three-way tie for the lead with Oosthuizen and Morikawa on the back-nine. He bogeyed the 11th from a greenside bunker, three-putted for par on the 14th, and, on the 17th, failed to get over the false front of the green with his approach shot from the fairway and made another bogey. After missing a birdie putt on the 18th, Spieth's two-foot-putt for par also missed.
