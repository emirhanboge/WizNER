Randall refused to star in any more television shows, favoring the Broadway stage as his medium.\nHe did star in the TV movies \"&lt;a href=\"Sunday%20Drive%20%28film%29\"&gt;Sunday Drive&lt;/a&gt;\" (1986) for Disney, \"Save the Dog!\" (1988), and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20in%20the%20Brown%20Suit\"&gt;The Man in the Brown Suit&lt;/a&gt;\" (1989).

The story began when, after Felix ruined plans for his daughter Edna's wedding, his wife Gloria threw him out of the house for 11 days, which left him no choice but to move back in with Oscar and to help him recover, getting him back in shape after throat cancer surgery had left his voice very raspy.\nRandall's later stage productions included \"Night Must Fall\" (1999) and \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" (2001).\nPeriodically, he performed in stage revivals of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Odd%20Couple%20%28play%29\"&gt;The Odd Couple&lt;/a&gt;\" with Klugman, including a stint in London in 1996.

He also admitted to sneaking tape recorders into operas to make his own private recordings. He chided &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Carson\"&gt;Johnny Carson&lt;/a&gt; for his chain smoking and was generally fastidious. At the time of his death, Randall had appeared as a guest on \"The Tonight Show\" 105 times, more often than any other celebrity had appeared.\nRandall appeared frequently on \"&lt;a href=\"What%27s%20My%20Line%3F\"&gt;What's My Line?&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Password%20%28American%20game%20show%29\"&gt;Password&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hollywood%20Squares\"&gt;The Hollywood Squares&lt;/a&gt;\", and the &lt;a href=\"Pyramid%20%28game%20show%29\"&gt;\"$10,000\" and \"$20,000 Pyramids\"&lt;/a&gt;. He also parodied his pompous image with an appearance as a \"contestant\" on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gong%20Show\"&gt;The Gong Show&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1977.\nRandall was a guest star on the fifth and final season of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Muppet%20Show\"&gt;The Muppet Show&lt;/a&gt;\" in an episode that first aired on October 11, 1980. This was the 100th episode of the show.\nRandall, along with &lt;a href=\"John%20Goodman\"&gt;John Goodman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drew%20Barrymore\"&gt;Drew Barrymore&lt;/a&gt;, was among the first guests on the debut episode of \"&lt;a href=\"Late%20Night%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien\"&gt;Late Night with Conan O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;\" on September 13, 1993.

He came in second place behind General &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Schwarzkopf%20Jr.\"&gt;Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.&lt;/a&gt; but ahead of actress &lt;a href=\"Stefanie%20Powers\"&gt;Stefanie Powers&lt;/a&gt;, with a final tally of $9,900.\nOther creative activities.\nIn 1973, Randall and Klugman recorded an album for &lt;a href=\"London%20Recordings\"&gt;London Records&lt;/a&gt; titled \"The Odd Couple Sings\". Roland Shaw and the London Festival Orchestra and Chorus provided the music and additional vocals. The record was not a chart-topper but is a highly sought-after item for many \"Odd Couple\" fans. Randall and Klugman also collaborated on a series of television commercials for Eagle brand snacks.\nA noted &lt;a href=\"Storytelling\"&gt;raconteur&lt;/a&gt;, Randall, along with co-writer Mike Mindlin, wrote a collection of amusing and sometimes racy showbusiness anecdotes called \"Which Reminds Me\", published in 1989.\nIn keeping with his penchant for both championing and mocking the culture that he loved, during the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Band\"&gt;Big Band&lt;/a&gt;-era revival in the mid-1960s, Randall produced a record album of 1930s songs, \"Vo Vo De Oh Doe\", inspired by (and covering) &lt;a href=\"the%20New%20Vaudeville%20Band\"&gt;the New Vaudeville Band&lt;/a&gt;'s one-hit wonder, \"&lt;a href=\"Winchester%20Cathedral%20%28song%29\"&gt;Winchester Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\" He mimicked (and somewhat exaggerated) the &lt;a href=\"vibrato\"&gt;vibrato&lt;/a&gt; style of &lt;a href=\"Carmen%20Lombardo\"&gt;Carmen Lombardo&lt;/a&gt;, and the two had once sung a duet of Lombardo's signature song \"Boo Hoo (You've Got Me Crying for You)\" on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tonight%20Show\"&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn the 1980s, Randall served as off-camera narrator for several video productions by the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt;, announcing performers to the television audience as they appeared on stage during curtain calls and providing brief descriptions of scenes. \nFor the 1990 sequel \"\", Randall lent his unmistakeable voice to the Brain Gremlin.\nActivism.\nRandall was an advocate for the arts. During the summer of 1980, he served as the celebrity host of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Philharmonic\"&gt;New York Philharmonic&lt;/a&gt; Orchestra's concerts in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Park\"&gt;Central Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.\nRandall was politically &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt;.

When he was dropped as a regular panelist on the \"Opera Quiz\" intermission feature of the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera%20radio%20broadcasts\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; because of his opposition to the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;, he donated the remainder of his contract fee to the McCarthy campaign. During the &lt;a href=\"1972%20Democratic%20Party%20presidential%20primaries\"&gt;U.S. presidential primaries&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1972%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt;, he appeared as the &lt;a href=\"George%20McGovern%201972%20presidential%20campaign\"&gt;featured celebrity&lt;/a&gt; at numerous fundraising house parties for &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href=\"George%20McGovern\"&gt;George McGovern&lt;/a&gt;. His name was featured on the &lt;a href=\"Master%20list%20of%20Nixon%27s%20political%20opponents\"&gt;master list of Richard Nixon's political opponents&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nRandall was married to his high school sweetheart Florence Gibbs from 1938 until her death from cancer on April 18, 1992.
