    "text": "Paraskev Ivanchov Stoyanov (; ) (January 30, 1871 \u2013 November 14, 1941) was a surgeon, anarchist, historian and professor. He is considered one of the fathers of Bulgarian and Romanian &lt;a href=\"anarchism\"&gt;anarchism&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe son of Ivancho Stoyanov, a Bulgarian active militant for national liberation from &lt;a href=\"Rouss%C3%A9\"&gt;Rouss\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, and Gabriela von Walter, a German woman, Paraskev was born on January 30, 1871 in the city of Giurgiu, Romania, where his father had fled to escape persecution from the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottomans&lt;/a&gt;. Belonging to a wealthy environment, Paraskev Stoyanov enjoyed a solid education, he studied at Bucharest's \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Sava%20College\"&gt;Saint Sava&lt;/a&gt;\" high school and at medical universities in &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. After primary school in Bucharest, he adhered to socialist ideas through high school, then to anarchism after reading &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Kropotkin\"&gt;Peter Kropotkin&lt;/a&gt;'s pamphlet \"An Appeal To The Young\". Thus, in high school, he founded book clubs for students studying socialism and anarchism and began to spread anarchism among the workers in Romania, coming to be considered the \"father\" of anarchism in the country. He translated into Romanian &lt;a href=\"Errico%20Malatesta\"&gt;Errico Malatesta&lt;/a&gt;'s numerous pamphlets, including \"For The Voters\", \"Between Peasants \" and \"Anarchy\".\nIn 1890, he went to perfect his studies of medicine in Paris, and took part in an international conference of students and the publication of a &lt;a href=\"libertarian\"&gt;libertarian&lt;/a&gt; manifesto with Italian libertarian socialist &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Saverio%20Merlino\"&gt;Francesco Saverio Merlino&lt;/a&gt;. Arrested the same day, then released on bail a few months later, he moved to Italy, then found refuge for a time in Switzerland, where he met the leading theorists of the anarchist movement: Peter Kropotkin and &lt;a href=\"%C3%89lis%C3%A9e%20Reclus\"&gt;\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter graduating in medicine at &lt;a href=\"W%C3%BCrzburg\"&gt;W\u00fcrzburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; (1895), he became a professor of surgery in the first &lt;a href=\"propaedeutics\"&gt;propaedeutics&lt;/a&gt; Medical Faculty in Sofia and wrote the first textbooks on surgery. In 1895, as a medical student, Stoyanov climbs &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Combin\"&gt;Mt. Grand Combin&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland, reaching 4318\u00a0m, and was greeted by &lt;a href=\"Aleko%20Konstantinov\"&gt;Aleko Konstantinov&lt;/a&gt;, who is considered a pioneer of Bulgarian alpinism. This is the first documented ascent of a Bulgarian to a height greater than 4000\u00a0m.\nStoyanov lived and worked in Varna between 1905 and 1918. There he established the Children Sea Sanatorium for Tuberculosis of Bones and Joints which was the only one of its kind on the Balkan Peninsula. Originally it was located in inadequate sheds in the area of \"Karantinata\". In the sanatorium were admitted children from 3 to 15 years of age from all over Bulgaria with no differentiation in their social status. From all the children under treatment 95% either improved their condition or were fully recovered. Prof. Dr. Stoyanov gained a worldwide recognition as one of the founders of Thalassotherapy (Seawater Therapy) and Heliotherapy (Sun Treatment). He urged persistently, \"Bulgarians should turn to the sea and start using its values!\" \nToday, the founder of Bulgarian surgery - Professor Dr. Paraskev is namesake of the &lt;a href=\"Medical%20University%20of%20Varna\"&gt;Medical University of Varna&lt;/a&gt; and Multi-profile Hospital for Active Treatment in &lt;a href=\"Lovech\"&gt;Lovech&lt;/a&gt;. Streets in &lt;a href=\"Pomorie\"&gt;Pomorie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varna%2C%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Varna&lt;/a&gt; bear his name."
