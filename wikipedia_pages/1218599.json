The family lived at 14 Findhorn Place in the &lt;a href=\"Grange%2C%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Grange district&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was educated at &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20Academy\"&gt;Edinburgh Academy&lt;/a&gt;. He then studied law at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;. Before the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; he had his own legal practice at 5 George Street in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Town%2C%20Edinburgh\"&gt;New Town&lt;/a&gt; and was living at \"St Abbs\", a villa on Russell Place in &lt;a href=\"Trinity%2C%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Trinity&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1908 he joined a territorial force: the Queen's Edinburgh Mounted Rifles. In 1914 he went to &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt; to settle the affairs of his cousin, Captain Arthur Milford Ker who had been killed in the first weeks of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; and Allan was persuaded to join his cousin's regiment; the &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Highlanders\"&gt;Gordon Highlanders&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was 35 years old, and a &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the 3rd Battalion, &lt;a href=\"The%20Gordon%20Highlanders\"&gt;The Gordon Highlanders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt;, attached 61st Battalion, &lt;a href=\"Machine%20Gun%20Corps\"&gt;Machine Gun Corps&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.\nOn 21 March 1918 near &lt;a href=\"Saint-Quentin%2C%20Aisne\"&gt;Saint-Quentin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, when the enemy had penetrated the British line, Lieutenant Ker, with one &lt;a href=\"Vickers%20gun\"&gt;Vickers gun&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded in holding up the attack, inflicting many casualties. He then stayed at his post with a sergeant and several men who had been badly wounded, beating off bayonet attacks with revolvers, the Vickers gun having been destroyed. Although exhausted from want of food and gas poisoning, as well as from fighting and attending to the wounded, Lieutenant Ker only surrendered when all his ammunition was spent and the position overrun - he had managed to hold 500 of the enemy off for three hours.\nHe was however captured in the event and spent the remainder of the war as a &lt;a href=\"prisoner-of-war\"&gt;prisoner-of-war&lt;/a&gt; only being released in December 1918. He was gazetted for the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt; on 4 September 1919 and was presented the medal personally by King &lt;a href=\"George%20V\"&gt;George V&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Buckingham%20Palace\"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt; on 26 November 1919. On 11 November 1920 he was one of the 100 Victoria Cross winners chosen as the guard of honour, escorting the gun carriage to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier\"&gt;Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe later achieved the rank of &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;. He was demobbed in 1922 and went back to practising law, but in London rather than Edinburgh.\nIn 1926 he was one of four VC holders who laid a wreath after the dedication of the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20Gun%20Corps%20Memorial\"&gt;Machine Gun Corps Memorial&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hyde%20Park%20Corner\"&gt;Hyde Park Corner&lt;/a&gt;. The others were &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Henry%20Cross\"&gt;Arthur Henry Cross&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Graham\"&gt;Reginald Graham&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"William%20Allison%20White\"&gt;William Allison White&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; he served on the Directorate of the Chief of the Imperial Staff. His duties included attendance at the &lt;a href=\"Potsdam%20Conference\"&gt;Potsdam Conference&lt;/a&gt; in July/August 1945.\nHe died at New Garden Hospital in &lt;a href=\"Hampstead\"&gt;Hampstead&lt;/a&gt;, north London, on 12 September 1958 aged 75. He is buried in &lt;a href=\"West%20Hampstead%20Cemetery\"&gt;West Hampstead Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; (plot Q4-7) but was also memorialised in 2018 on his parents restored grave in &lt;a href=\"Grange%2C%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Grange Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in south Edinburgh.\nRecognition.\n&lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Powell\"&gt;Anthony Powell&lt;/a&gt; later used him as the inspiration for the character of Colonel Finn in his novels \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Soldier%27s%20Art\"&gt;The Soldier's Art&lt;/a&gt;\" (1966) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Military%20Philosophers\"&gt;The Military Philosophers&lt;/a&gt;\" (1968).\nA plaque was erected on his birthplace at Findhorn Place in Edinburgh in 2018.\nHonours.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe Medal.\nHis VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20War%20Museum\"&gt;Imperial War Museum&lt;/a&gt;, London."
