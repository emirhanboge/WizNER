    "text": "Raymond Francis \"Buster\" Reutt (March 4, 1917\u00a0\u2013 August 18, 2004) was a professional &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player for one season, 1943, in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;. He was a member of the \"&lt;a href=\"Steagles\"&gt;Steagles&lt;/a&gt;\", a team that was the result of a temporary merger between the Eagles and &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; due to the league-wide manning shortages in 1943 brought on by &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. He was also an alumnus of the &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Military%20Institute\"&gt;Virginia Military Institute&lt;/a&gt;."
