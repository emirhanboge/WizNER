    "text": "John Eric Holmes (February 16, 1930 \u2013 March 20, 2010) was an American &lt;a href=\"professor\"&gt;professor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"neurology\"&gt;neurology&lt;/a&gt; and writer of &lt;a href=\"non-fiction\"&gt;non-fiction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fantasy\"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"science%20fiction\"&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt;. His writings appeared under his full name and under variants such as Eric Holmes and J. Eric Holmes and the pen name Sidney Leland.\nLife.\nHolmes was the son of US Naval officer &lt;a href=\"Wilfred%20Holmes\"&gt;Wilfred \"Jasper\" Holmes&lt;/a&gt; and his wife Isabelle West Holmes. Wilfred Holmes was also a writer of adventure stories under the pen name Alec Hudson. Like his father, John Eric Holmes also served in the armed forces, as a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps. He fought for two years in Korea. He was a medical doctor and an associate &lt;a href=\"professor\"&gt;professor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"neurology\"&gt;neurology&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20California\"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; School of Medicine. He had a son named Christopher West Holmes.\nWriting career.\nHolmes was a long-time science fiction &lt;a href=\"Fan%20%28aficionado%29\"&gt;fan&lt;/a&gt;, particularly of the works of &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Rice%20Burroughs\"&gt;Edgar Rice Burroughs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"H.%20P.%20Lovecraft\"&gt;H. P. Lovecraft&lt;/a&gt;, and an enthusiast of &lt;a href=\"Role-playing%20game\"&gt;fantasy role-playing games&lt;/a&gt;. His writings reflected both his chosen profession and his hobbies, beginning with an early short story published in 1951 and factual articles on neurology for the science fiction magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact\"&gt;Astounding&lt;/a&gt;\" and its successor \"&lt;a href=\"Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact\"&gt;Analog&lt;/a&gt;\" in the early 1960s.\nHe later wrote on \"&lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons\"&gt;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&lt;/a&gt;\", from the perspectives of both a &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Master\"&gt;Dungeon Master&lt;/a&gt; and an authority on the psychology of gaming, serving as editor of the \"&lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20Basic%20Set\"&gt;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set&lt;/a&gt;\" RPG rule book, and writing a series of fantasies set in a D&amp;D-influenced world, including four short stories and one novel. These stories, along with a previously unpublished story, were collected in 2017 into the book \"Tales of Peril: the Complete Boinger &amp; Zereth Stories of John Eric Holmes\", edited by Allan T. Grohe, Jr and published by Black Blade Publishing.\nHolmes approached &lt;a href=\"TSR%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;TSR&lt;/a&gt; with an offer to write an introductory version of \"D&amp;D\", to expand the game's demographics to younger players and possibly get it into the mass market as well. His \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set\" (1977) was a revision of &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Gygax\"&gt;Gary Gygax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Arneson\"&gt;Dave Arneson&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20%281974%29\"&gt;original game&lt;/a&gt; plus the early supplements, \"&lt;a href=\"Greyhawk%20%28supplement%29\"&gt;Greyhawk&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Blackmoor%20%28supplement%29\"&gt;Blackmoor&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Eldritch%20Wizardry\"&gt;Eldritch Wizardry&lt;/a&gt;\". Holmes created the &lt;a href=\"wereshark\"&gt;wereshark&lt;/a&gt; monster for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", first publishing it in \"&lt;a href=\"Alarums%20%26amp%3B%20Excursions\"&gt;Alarums &amp; Excursions&lt;/a&gt;\" #13 (July 1976).\nTaking his writing more \"mainstream,\" he wrote with &lt;a href=\"David%20F.%20Lindsley\"&gt;David F. Lindsley&lt;/a&gt; the textbook \"Basic Human Neurophysiology\" (1984), and on his own &lt;a href=\"pastiche\"&gt;pastiche&lt;/a&gt; speculative fiction novels set in the inner world of Edgar Rice Burroughs's &lt;a href=\"Pellucidar\"&gt;Pellucidar&lt;/a&gt;, the fictional future of &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Francis%20Nowlan\"&gt;Philip Francis Nowlan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Buck%20Rogers\"&gt;Buck Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, and the fictional past of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20E.%20Howard\"&gt;Robert E. Howard&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Conan%20the%20Barbarian\"&gt;Conan the Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nHolmes's two Pellucidar novels were \"&lt;a href=\"Mahars%20of%20Pellucidar\"&gt;Mahars of Pellucidar&lt;/a&gt;\", authorized by the Burroughs estate, and \"Red Axe of Pellucidar\", reportedly blocked by the same authority. Ready for publication in 1980, it only saw print thirteen years later in a private printing. A planned third novel in the series, \"Swordsmen of Pellucidar\", remained unfinished.\nHis other pastiches also met with mixed success. While \"Mordred\", his Buck Rogers novel, saw print, his Conan novel, while contracted and paid for by &lt;a href=\"Tor%20Books\"&gt;Tor Books&lt;/a&gt;, was ultimately rejected. Another novel, \"Danton Doring\", a collaboration with Burroughs' son &lt;a href=\"John%20Coleman%20Burroughs\"&gt;John Coleman Burroughs&lt;/a&gt;, whom he helped treat for Parkinson's disease, was never completed.\nHolmes was a regular guest at Burroughs fan conventions such as the Edgar Rice Burroughs Chain of Friendship (ECOF). He received its Lifetime Achievement Award for his Burroughs pastiches at ECOF '93 in &lt;a href=\"Willows%2C%20California\"&gt;Willows, California&lt;/a&gt;. He was slated to appear as Guest of Honor at 2004's ECOF Convention in &lt;a href=\"Sacramento%2C%20California\"&gt;Sacramento, California&lt;/a&gt;, but suffered a stroke and was unable to attend. He was a special guest at the June 2005 ECOF in &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;.\nBibliography.\nFiction.\nBoinger the Halfling and Zereth the Elf.\nThe stories published in \"&lt;a href=\"Alarums%20and%20Excursions\"&gt;Alarums &amp; Excursions&lt;/a&gt;\" (A&amp;E), included illustrations by Chris Holmes:"
