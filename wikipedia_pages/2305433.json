    "text": "Saint Philip II of Moscow (11 February 1507 \u2013 23 December 1569) was a &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Orthodox\"&gt;Russian Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;, who became &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Metropolitan of Moscow&lt;/a&gt; during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20the%20Terrible\"&gt;Ivan the Terrible&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of a few &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20bishop\"&gt;Metropolitans&lt;/a&gt; who dared openly to contradict royal authority, and it is widely believed that the Tsar had him murdered on that account. He is venerated as a &lt;a href=\"saint\"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"martyr\"&gt;martyr&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nHe was born Feodor Stepanovich Kolychev into one of the noblest &lt;a href=\"boyar\"&gt;boyar&lt;/a&gt; families of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Muscovy&lt;/a&gt;, in the city of &lt;a href=\"Galich%2C%20Russia\"&gt;Galich&lt;/a&gt; (in present-day &lt;a href=\"Kostroma%20Oblast\"&gt;Kostroma Oblast&lt;/a&gt;). However, according to some sources, he was born in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prince\"&gt;Grand Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vasili%20III%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Vasili III&lt;/a&gt; took young Theodore into the &lt;a href=\"royal%20court\"&gt;royal court&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that since childhood Theodore was on friendly terms with &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20IV%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Ivan IV of Russia&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ivan the Terrible\"). \nAccording to other accounts, he was involved in the conspiracy of Prince &lt;a href=\"Andrey%20of%20Staritsa\"&gt;Andrey of Staritsa&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Glinskaya\"&gt;Elena Glinskaya&lt;/a&gt; and, when their plans were discovered, he escaped to &lt;a href=\"Solovetsky%20Monastery\"&gt;Solovetsky Monastery&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"White%20Sea\"&gt;White Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Yet another account says that his decision to become a monk occurred on Sunday 5 June 1537, while he was standing in church for the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Liturgy\"&gt;Divine Liturgy&lt;/a&gt;, on hearing the words of Jesus: \"No man can serve two masters\" (). According to this account, he secretly left Moscow dressed as a \"&lt;a href=\"muzhik\"&gt;muzhik&lt;/a&gt;\" (peasant), and for a while he hid himself away from the world in the village of Khizna, near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Onega\"&gt;Lake Onega&lt;/a&gt;, earning his livelihood as a shepherd, later joining the monastery at Solovetsk. At any rate, he entered the monastery at Solovki at the age of 30, and a year and a half later he was &lt;a href=\"tonsure\"&gt;tonsure&lt;/a&gt;d (took &lt;a href=\"monastic%20vows\"&gt;monastic vows&lt;/a&gt;), receiving the &lt;a href=\"religious%20name\"&gt;religious name&lt;/a&gt; of Philip. In the monastery he worked at the iron &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; and as a &lt;a href=\"baker\"&gt;baker&lt;/a&gt;.\nEleven years later, Philip was made &lt;a href=\"hegumen\"&gt;hegumen&lt;/a&gt; (abbot) of the monastery. During his term in office, they constructed two &lt;a href=\"Katholikon\"&gt;cathedrals&lt;/a&gt;, a brick-yard, many water-mills and storehouses, and a network of canals connecting 72 lakes. It is said that Philip took part in all these toils together with other monks. As a result, the monastery experienced a spiritual revival. He also adopted a new &lt;a href=\"monastic%20Rule\"&gt;monastic Rule&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Typicon\"&gt;Typicon&lt;/a&gt;) for the community. Most of Philip's projects in Solovki survive to this day.\nThe tsar heard about the indefatigable monk and asked him to fill the vacant &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20see\"&gt;metropolitan see&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. Philip agreed on condition that Ivan would abolish &lt;a href=\"Oprichnina\"&gt;Oprichnina&lt;/a&gt;. On 25 June 1566 Philip was &lt;a href=\"consecrated\"&gt;consecrated&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; and enthroned as Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia.\nAfter only two years, however, &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20the%20Terrible\"&gt;Ivan the Terrible&lt;/a&gt; persisted with committing murders under the aegis of Oprichnina. During &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lent\"&gt;Great Lent&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Sunday%20of%20the%20Veneration%20of%20the%20Cross\"&gt;Sunday of the Veneration of the Cross&lt;/a&gt;, 2 March 1568, when the Tsar came to the cathedral for &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Liturgy\"&gt;Divine Liturgy&lt;/a&gt;, Philip refused to &lt;a href=\"blessing\"&gt;bless&lt;/a&gt; him and publicly rebuked him for the ongoing massacre. The &lt;a href=\"Massacre%20of%20Novgorod\"&gt;Massacre of Novgorod&lt;/a&gt; ensued, and Philip's condemnation followed.\nIvan eventually &lt;a href=\"deposition%20%28politics%29\"&gt;deposed&lt;/a&gt; Philip from office by raising incredible charges of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28paranormal%29\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt; and dissolute living. Philip was arrested during Liturgy at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Dormition\"&gt;Cathedral of Dormition&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned in a dingy cell of the Theophany (Bogoiavlenskii) Monastery, fettered with chains, with a heavy collar around his neck, and was deprived of food for a few days in succession. Then he was transferred and immured at the Monastery of the Fathers (Otroch Monastery) at &lt;a href=\"Tver\"&gt;Tver&lt;/a&gt;. In November 1568, the tsar summoned the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Synod\"&gt;Holy Synod&lt;/a&gt;, which had Philip deposed. A year later, on 23 December 1569, he was strangled by the Tsar's minion, &lt;a href=\"Malyuta%20Skuratov\"&gt;Malyuta Skuratov&lt;/a&gt; at Otroch, two days before &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt;. As if aware of his approaching death, Philip had asked to receive &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Communion\"&gt;Holy Communion&lt;/a&gt; three days earlier.\nCommemoration as a saint.\nAfter his &lt;a href=\"martyr\"&gt;martyr&lt;/a&gt;dom, monks from Solovki Monastery asked for permission to transfer the body of St. Philip to their monastery. When they opened up the tomb they found the body of the hierarch was &lt;a href=\"incorrupt\"&gt;incorrupt&lt;/a&gt;, and various healings began to be reported. The transfer of his remains from Tver to the Solovki Monastery took place in 1590.\nIn 1652, &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20Nikon\"&gt;Patriarch Nikon&lt;/a&gt; persuaded &lt;a href=\"Tsar%20Alexis\"&gt;Tsar Alexis&lt;/a&gt; to bring Philip's &lt;a href=\"relic\"&gt;relic&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, where he was &lt;a href=\"canonization\"&gt;glorified&lt;/a&gt; (proclaimed a &lt;a href=\"saint\"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt;) later that same year. His memory is celebrated three times a year: "
