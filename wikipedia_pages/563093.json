    "title": "Paracrine signaling",
    "text": "Paracrine signaling is a form of &lt;a href=\"cell%20signaling\"&gt;cell signaling&lt;/a&gt;, a type of &lt;a href=\"cellular%20communication%20%28biology%29\"&gt;cellular communication&lt;/a&gt; in which a cell produces a signal to induce changes in nearby cells, altering the behaviour of those cells. Signaling molecules known as paracrine factors diffuse over a relatively short distance (local action), as opposed to cell signaling by &lt;a href=\"endocrine%20system\"&gt;endocrine factors&lt;/a&gt;, hormones which travel considerably longer distances via the &lt;a href=\"circulatory%20system\"&gt;circulatory system&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"juxtacrine%20signaling\"&gt;juxtacrine interactions&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"autocrine%20signaling\"&gt;autocrine signaling&lt;/a&gt;. Cells that produce paracrine factors secrete them into the immediate &lt;a href=\"extracellular\"&gt;extracellular&lt;/a&gt; environment. Factors then travel to nearby cells in which the gradient of factor received determines the outcome. However, the exact distance that paracrine factors can travel is not certain.\nAlthough paracrine signaling elicits a diverse array of responses in the induced cells, most paracrine factors utilize a relatively streamlined set of &lt;a href=\"Receptor%20%28biochemistry%29\"&gt;receptor&lt;/a&gt;s and pathways. In fact, different &lt;a href=\"organ%20%28biology%29\"&gt;organ&lt;/a&gt;s in the body - even between different species - are known to utilize a similar sets of paracrine factors in differential development. The highly conserved receptors and pathways can be organized into four major families based on similar structures: &lt;a href=\"fibroblast%20growth%20factor\"&gt;fibroblast growth factor&lt;/a&gt; (FGF) family, &lt;a href=\"Hedgehog%20signaling%20pathway\"&gt;Hedgehog&lt;/a&gt; family, &lt;a href=\"Wnt%20signaling%20pathway\"&gt;Wnt&lt;/a&gt; family, and &lt;a href=\"Transforming%20growth%20factor%20beta\"&gt;TGF-\u03b2 superfamily&lt;/a&gt;. Binding of a paracrine factor to its respective receptor initiates &lt;a href=\"signal%20transduction\"&gt;signal transduction&lt;/a&gt; cascades, eliciting different responses.\nParacrine factors induce competent responders.\nIn order for paracrine factors to successfully induce a response in the receiving cell, that cell must have the appropriate receptors available on the cell membrane to receive the signals, also known as being &lt;a href=\"natural%20competence\"&gt;competent&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the responding cell must also have the ability to be mechanistically induced.\nFibroblast growth factor (FGF) family.\nAlthough the FGF family of paracrine factors has a broad range of functions, major findings support the idea that they primarily stimulate proliferation and differentiation. To fulfill many diverse functions, FGFs can be alternatively spliced or even have different initiation codons to create hundreds of different FGF &lt;a href=\"isoforms\"&gt;isoforms&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the most important functions of the FGF receptors (FGFR) is in limb development. This signaling involves nine different &lt;a href=\"alternatively%20spliced\"&gt;alternatively spliced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"isoforms\"&gt;isoforms&lt;/a&gt; of the receptor. \"Fgf\"8 and \"Fgf\"10 are two of the critical players in limb development. In the forelimb initiation and limb growth in mice, axial (lengthwise) cues from the intermediate &lt;a href=\"mesoderm\"&gt;mesoderm&lt;/a&gt; produces \"Tbx\"5, which subsequently signals to the same &lt;a href=\"mesoderm\"&gt;mesoderm&lt;/a&gt; to produce \"Fgf\"10. \"Fgf\"10 then signals to the &lt;a href=\"ectoderm\"&gt;ectoderm&lt;/a&gt; to begin production of \"Fgf\"8, which also stimulates the production of \"Fgf\"10. Deletion of \"Fgf\"10 results in limbless mice.\nAdditionally, paracrine signaling of Fgf is essential in the developing eye of chicks. The \"fgf\"8 &lt;a href=\"mRNA\"&gt;mRNA&lt;/a&gt; becomes localized in what differentiates into the neural &lt;a href=\"retina\"&gt;retina&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"optic%20cup%20%28embryology%29\"&gt;optic cup&lt;/a&gt;. These cells are in contact with the outer ectoderm cells, which will eventually become the lens.\n&lt;a href=\"Phenotype\"&gt;Phenotype&lt;/a&gt; and survival of mice after knockout of some FGFR genes:\nReceptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway.\nParacrine signaling through &lt;a href=\"fibroblast%20growth%20factors\"&gt;fibroblast growth factors&lt;/a&gt; and its respective receptors utilizes the receptor &lt;a href=\"tyrosine\"&gt;tyrosine&lt;/a&gt; pathway. This signaling pathway has been highly studied, using \"Drosophila\" eyes and human cancers.\nBinding of FGF to FGFR &lt;a href=\"phosphorylates\"&gt;phosphorylates&lt;/a&gt; the idle &lt;a href=\"kinase\"&gt;kinase&lt;/a&gt; and activates the RTK pathway. This pathway begins at the cell membrane surface, where a &lt;a href=\"ligand\"&gt;ligand&lt;/a&gt; binds to its specific receptor. Ligands that bind to RTKs include &lt;a href=\"fibroblast%20growth%20factors\"&gt;fibroblast growth factors&lt;/a&gt;, epidermal growth factors, platelet-derived growth factors, and &lt;a href=\"stem%20cell%20factor\"&gt;stem cell factor&lt;/a&gt;. This dimerizes the transmembrane receptor to another RTK receptor, which causes the autophosphorylation and subsequent &lt;a href=\"conformational%20change\"&gt;conformational change&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"homodimer\"&gt;homodimer&lt;/a&gt;ized receptor. This conformational change activates the dormant kinase of each RTK on the tyrosine residue. Due to the fact that the receptor spans across the membrane from the extracellular environment, through the &lt;a href=\"lipid%20bilayer\"&gt;lipid bilayer&lt;/a&gt;, and into the &lt;a href=\"cytoplasm\"&gt;cytoplasm&lt;/a&gt;, the binding of the receptor to the ligand also causes the trans phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Signal%20transducing%20adaptor%20protein\"&gt;adaptor protein&lt;/a&gt; (such as SOS) recognizes the phosphorylated tyrosine on the receptor. This protein functions as a bridge which connects the RTK to an intermediate protein (such as GNRP), starting the intracellular signaling cascade. In turn, the intermediate protein stimulates GDP-bound Ras to the activated GTP-bound Ras. GAP eventually returns Ras to its inactive state. Activation of &lt;a href=\"Ras%20subfamily\"&gt;Ras&lt;/a&gt; has the potential to initiate three signaling pathways downstream of Ras: Ras\u2192Raf\u2192MAP kinase pathway, PI3 kinase pathway, and Ral pathway. Each pathway leads to the activation of transcription factors which enter the nucleus to alter gene expression.\nRTK receptor and cancer.\nParacrine signaling of growth factors between nearby cells has been shown to exacerbate &lt;a href=\"carcinogenesis\"&gt;carcinogenesis&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, mutant forms of a single RTK may play a causal role in very different types of cancer. The Kit &lt;a href=\"proto-oncogene\"&gt;proto-oncogene&lt;/a&gt; encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor whose ligand is a paracrine protein called stem cell factor (SCF), which is important in &lt;a href=\"hematopoiesis\"&gt;hematopoiesis&lt;/a&gt; (formation of cells in blood). The Kit receptor and related tyrosine kinase receptors actually are inhibitory and effectively suppresses receptor firing. Mutant forms of the Kit receptor, which fire constitutively in a ligand-independent fashion, are found in a diverse array of cancerous malignancies.\nRTK pathway and cancer.\nResearch on &lt;a href=\"thyroid%20cancer\"&gt;thyroid cancer&lt;/a&gt; has elucidated the theory that paracrine signaling may aid in creating tumor microenvironments. &lt;a href=\"Chemokine\"&gt;Chemokine&lt;/a&gt; transcription is upregulated when Ras is in the GTP-bound state. The chemokines are then released from the cell, free to bind to another nearby cell. Paracrine signaling between neighboring cells creates this positive feedback loop. Thus, the constitutive transcription of upregulated proteins form ideal environments for tumors to arise. Effectively, multiple bindings of ligands to the RTK receptors overstimulates the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, which &lt;a href=\"Overexpression\"&gt;overexpresses&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"mitogen\"&gt;mitogen&lt;/a&gt;ic and invasive capacity of cells.\nJAK-STAT pathway.\nIn addition to RTK pathway, &lt;a href=\"fibroblast%20growth%20factors\"&gt;fibroblast growth factors&lt;/a&gt; can also activate the &lt;a href=\"JAK-STAT%20signaling%20pathway\"&gt;JAK-STAT signaling pathway&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of carrying covalently associated tyrosine kinase domains, Jak-STAT receptors form noncovalent complexes with tyrosine kinases of the Jak (&lt;a href=\"Janus%20kinase\"&gt;Janus kinase&lt;/a&gt;) class. These receptors bind are for &lt;a href=\"erythropoietin\"&gt;erythropoietin&lt;/a&gt; (important for &lt;a href=\"erythropoiesis\"&gt;erythropoiesis&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"thrombopoietin\"&gt;thrombopoietin&lt;/a&gt; (important for &lt;a href=\"platelet\"&gt;platelet&lt;/a&gt; formation), and &lt;a href=\"interferon\"&gt;interferon&lt;/a&gt; (important for mediating immune cell function).\nAfter dimerization of the cytokine receptors following ligand binding, the JAKs transphosphorylate each other. The resulting phosphotyrosines attract STAT proteins. The STAT proteins dimerize and enter the nucleus to act as &lt;a href=\"transcription%20factors\"&gt;transcription factors&lt;/a&gt; to alter gene expression. In particular, the STATs transcribe genes that aid in cell proliferation and survival \u2013 such as myc.\nPhenotype and survival of mice after knockout of some JAK or STAT genes: \nAberrant JAK-STAT pathway and bone mutations.\nThe JAK-STAT signaling pathway is instrumental in the development of limbs, specifically in its ability to regulate bone growth through paracrine signaling of cytokines. However, mutations in this pathway have been implicated in severe forms of dwarfism: &lt;a href=\"thanatophoric%20dysplasia\"&gt;thanatophoric dysplasia&lt;/a&gt; (lethal) and &lt;a href=\"Achondroplasia\"&gt;achondroplasic&lt;/a&gt; dwarfism (viable). This is due to a mutation in a &lt;a href=\"Fibroblast%20growth%20factor\"&gt;Fgf&lt;/a&gt; gene, causing a premature and constitutive activation of the &lt;a href=\"Stat1\"&gt;Stat1&lt;/a&gt; transcription factor. &lt;a href=\"Chondrocyte\"&gt;Chondrocyte&lt;/a&gt; cell division is prematurely terminated, resulting in lethal dwarfism. Rib and limb bone growth plate cells are not transcribed. Thus, the inability of the rib cage to expand prevents the newborn's breathing.\nJAK-STAT pathway and cancer.\nResearch on paracrine signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway revealed its potential in activating invasive behavior of ovarian &lt;a href=\"epithelium\"&gt;epithelial cells&lt;/a&gt;. This epithelial to &lt;a href=\"mesenchymal\"&gt;mesenchymal&lt;/a&gt; transition is highly evident in &lt;a href=\"metastasis\"&gt;metastasis&lt;/a&gt;. Paracrine signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway is necessary in the transition from stationary epithelial cells to mobile mesenchymal cells, which are capable of invading surrounding tissue. Only the JAK-STAT pathway has been found to induce migratory cells.\nHedgehog family.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hedgehog%20signaling%20pathway\"&gt;Hedgehog protein family&lt;/a&gt; is involved in induction of cell types and the creation of tissue boundaries and patterning and are found in all bilateral organisms. Hedgehog proteins were first discovered and studied in \"&lt;a href=\"Drosophila\"&gt;Drosophila&lt;/a&gt;\". Hedgehog proteins produce key signals for the establishment of limb and &lt;a href=\"body%20plan\"&gt;body plan&lt;/a&gt; of fruit flies as well as &lt;a href=\"homeostasis\"&gt;homeostasis&lt;/a&gt; of adult tissues, involved in late &lt;a href=\"embryogenesis\"&gt;embryogenesis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"metamorphosis\"&gt;metamorphosis&lt;/a&gt;. At least three \"Drosophila\" hedgehog &lt;a href=\"homologs\"&gt;homologs&lt;/a&gt; have been found in vertebrates: sonic hedgehog, desert hedgehog, and Indian hedgehog. Sonic hedgehog (&lt;a href=\"Sonic%20hedgehog\"&gt;SHH&lt;/a&gt;) has various roles in vertebrae development, mediating signaling and regulating the organization of central nervous system, limb, and &lt;a href=\"somite\"&gt;somite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Polarity%20in%20embryogenesis\"&gt;polarity&lt;/a&gt;. Desert hedgehog (&lt;a href=\"DHH%20%28hedgehog%29\"&gt;DHH&lt;/a&gt;) is expressed in the &lt;a href=\"Sertoli%20cell\"&gt;Sertoli cell&lt;/a&gt;s involved in &lt;a href=\"spermatogenesis\"&gt;spermatogenesis&lt;/a&gt;. Indian hedgehog (&lt;a href=\"IHH%20%28protein%29\"&gt;IHH&lt;/a&gt;) is expressed in the gut and cartilage, important in postnatal bone growth.\nHedgehog signaling pathway.\nMembers of the Hedgehog protein family act by binding to a &lt;a href=\"transmembrane\"&gt;transmembrane&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Patched\"&gt;Patched&lt;/a&gt;\" receptor, which is bound to the \"&lt;a href=\"Smoothened\"&gt;Smoothened&lt;/a&gt;\" protein, by which the Hedgehog signal can be &lt;a href=\"Signal%20transduction\"&gt;transduced&lt;/a&gt;. In the absence of Hedgehog, the Patched receptor inhibits Smoothened action. Inhibition of Smoothened causes the &lt;a href=\"ci%20protein\"&gt;Cubitus interruptus&lt;/a&gt; (Ci), Fused, and Cos protein complex attached to microtubules to remain intact. In this conformation, the Ci protein is cleaved so that a portion of the protein is allowed to enter the nucleus and act as a transcriptional &lt;a href=\"repressor\"&gt;repressor&lt;/a&gt;. In the presence of Hedgehog, Patched no longer inhibits Smoothened. Then active Smoothened protein is able to inhibit &lt;a href=\"Protein%20kinase%20A\"&gt;PKA&lt;/a&gt; and Slimb, so that the Ci protein is not cleaved. This intact Ci protein can enter the nucleus, associate with CPB protein and act as a transcriptional &lt;a href=\"activator%20%28genetics%29\"&gt;activator&lt;/a&gt;, inducing the expression of Hedgehog-response genes.\nHedgehog signaling pathway and cancer.\nThe Hedgehog Signaling pathway is critical in proper tissue patterning and orientation during normal development of most animals. Hedgehog proteins induce &lt;a href=\"cell%20proliferation\"&gt;cell proliferation&lt;/a&gt; in certain cells and differentiations in others. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog pathway has been implicated in several types of &lt;a href=\"cancers\"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Basal%20Cell%20Carcinoma\"&gt;Basal Cell Carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; in particular. This uncontrolled activation of the Hedgehog proteins can be caused by mutations to the signal pathway, which would be &lt;a href=\"ligand\"&gt;ligand&lt;/a&gt; independent, or a mutation that causes &lt;a href=\"overexpression\"&gt;overexpression&lt;/a&gt; of the Hedgehog protein, which would be ligand dependent. In addition, therapy-induced Hedgehog pathway activation has been shown to be necessary for progression of Prostate Cancer tumors after &lt;a href=\"androgen%20deprivation%20therapy\"&gt;androgen deprivation therapy&lt;/a&gt;. This connection between the Hedgehog signaling pathway and human cancers may provide for the possible of therapeutic intervention as treatment for such cancers. The Hedgehog signaling pathway is also involved in normal regulation of &lt;a href=\"stem-cell\"&gt;stem-cell&lt;/a&gt; populations, and required for normal growth and regeneration of damaged organs. This may provide another possible route for &lt;a href=\"tumorigenesis\"&gt;tumorigenesis&lt;/a&gt; via the Hedgehog pathway.\nWnt family.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wnt%20protein\"&gt;Wnt protein&lt;/a&gt; family includes a large number of &lt;a href=\"cysteine\"&gt;cysteine&lt;/a&gt;-rich &lt;a href=\"glycoproteins\"&gt;glycoproteins&lt;/a&gt;. The Wnt proteins activate &lt;a href=\"signal%20transduction\"&gt;signal transduction&lt;/a&gt; cascades via three different pathways, the canonical &lt;a href=\"Wnt%20pathway\"&gt;Wnt pathway&lt;/a&gt;, the noncanonical &lt;a href=\"Planar%20cell%20polarity\"&gt;planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway&lt;/a&gt;, and the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. Wnt proteins appear to control a wide range of developmental processes and have been seen as necessary for control of &lt;a href=\"Spindle%20apparatus\"&gt;spindle&lt;/a&gt; orientation, cell polarity, cadherin mediated adhesion, and early development of embryos in many different organisms. Current research has indicated that deregulation of Wnt signaling plays a role in tumor formation, because at a cellular level, Wnt proteins often regulated &lt;a href=\"cell%20proliferation\"&gt;cell proliferation&lt;/a&gt;, cell morphology, cell &lt;a href=\"motility\"&gt;motility&lt;/a&gt;, and cell fate.\nThe canonical Wnt signaling pathway.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"WNT%20pathway\"&gt;canonical pathway&lt;/a&gt;, Wnt proteins binds to its transmembrane receptor of the &lt;a href=\"Frizzled\"&gt;Frizzled&lt;/a&gt; family of proteins. The binding of Wnt to a Frizzled protein activates the &lt;a href=\"Dishevelled\"&gt;Dishevelled&lt;/a&gt; protein. In its active state the Dishevelled protein inhibits the activity of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (&lt;a href=\"GSK3\"&gt;GSK3&lt;/a&gt;) enzyme. Normally active GSK3 prevents the dissociation of \u03b2-catenin to the &lt;a href=\"Adenomatous%20polyposis%20coli\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; protein, which results in &lt;a href=\"%CE%B2-catenin\"&gt;\u03b2-catenin&lt;/a&gt; degradation. Thus inhibited GSK3, allows \u03b2-catenin to dissociate from APC, accumulate, and travel to nucleus. In the nucleus \u03b2-catenin associates with Lef/Tcf &lt;a href=\"transcription%20factor\"&gt;transcription factor&lt;/a&gt;, which is already working on DNA as a repressor, inhibiting the transcription of the genes it binds. Binding of \u03b2-catenin to Lef/Tcf works as a transcription activator, activating the transcription of the Wnt-responsive genes.\nThe noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways.\nThe noncanonical Wnt pathways provide a signal transduction pathway for Wnt that does not involve &lt;a href=\"%CE%B2-catenin\"&gt;\u03b2-catenin&lt;/a&gt;. In the noncanonical pathways, Wnt affects the &lt;a href=\"actin\"&gt;actin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Microtubule\"&gt;microtubular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cytoskeleton\"&gt;cytoskeleton&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"gene%20transcription\"&gt;gene transcription&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe noncanonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway.\nThe noncanonical PCP pathway regulates cell &lt;a href=\"morphology%20%28biology%29\"&gt;morphology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cell%20division\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cell%20%28biology%29%23Movement%20or%20motility\"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt;. Once again Wnt proteins binds to and activates Frizzled so that Frizzled activates a Dishevelled protein that is tethered to the plasma membrane through a &lt;a href=\"Prickle%20%28protein%29\"&gt;Prickle protein&lt;/a&gt; and transmembrane Stbm protein. The active Dishevelled activates RhoA &lt;a href=\"GTPase\"&gt;GTPase&lt;/a&gt; through Dishevelled associated activator of &lt;a href=\"Morphogenesis\"&gt;morphogenesis 1&lt;/a&gt; (Daam1) and the &lt;a href=\"Rac%20protein\"&gt;Rac protein&lt;/a&gt;. Active RhoA is able to induce cytoskeleton changes by activating Roh-associated kinase (ROCK) and affect gene transcription directly. Active Rac can directly induce cytoskeleton changes and affect gene transcription through activation of JNK.\nThe noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway.\nThe noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway regulates intracellular &lt;a href=\"calcium\"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; levels. Again Wnt binds and activates to Frizzled. In this case however activated Frizzled causes a coupled G-protein to activate a &lt;a href=\"phospholipase\"&gt;phospholipase&lt;/a&gt; (PLC), which interacts with and splits PIP2 into DAG and IP3. IP3 can then bind to a receptor on the &lt;a href=\"endoplasmic%20reticulum\"&gt;endoplasmic reticulum&lt;/a&gt; to release intracellular calcium stores, to induce calcium-dependent gene expression.\nWnt signaling pathways and cancer.\nThe Wnt signaling pathways are critical in cell-cell signaling during normal development and embryogenesis and required for maintenance of adult tissue, therefore it is not difficult to understand why disruption in Wnt signaling pathways can promote human &lt;a href=\"degenerative%20disease\"&gt;degenerative disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cancer\"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wnt signaling pathways are complex, involving many different elements, and therefore have many targets for misregulation. Mutations that cause constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling pathway lead to tumor formation and cancer. Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway can lead to increase cell proliferation. Current research is focused on the action of the Wnt signaling pathway the regulation of stem cell choice to proliferate and self renew. This action of Wnt signaling in the possible control and maintenance of stem cells, may provide a possible treatment in cancers exhibiting aberrant Wnt signaling.\nTGF-\u03b2 superfamily.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Transforming%20growth%20factor\"&gt;TGF&lt;/a&gt;\" (Transforming Growth Factor) is a family of proteins that includes 33 members that encode &lt;a href=\"protein%20dimer\"&gt;dimeric&lt;/a&gt;, secreted polypeptides that regulate development. Many developmental processes are under its control including gastrulation, axis symmetry of the body, organ morphogenesis, and tissue homeostasis in adults. All &lt;a href=\"TGF-%CE%B2\"&gt;TGF-\u03b2&lt;/a&gt; ligands bind to either Type I or Type II receptors, to create heterotetramic complexes.\nTGF-\u03b2 pathway.\nThe &lt;a href=\"TGF%20beta%20signaling%20pathway\"&gt;TGF-\u03b2 pathway&lt;/a&gt; regulates many cellular processes in developing embryo and adult organisms, including &lt;a href=\"cell%20growth\"&gt;cell growth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cellular%20differentiation\"&gt;differentiation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"apoptosis\"&gt;apoptosis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"homeostasis\"&gt;homeostasis&lt;/a&gt;. There are five kinds of type II receptors and seven types of type I receptors in humans and other mammals. These receptors are known as \"dual-specificity kinases\" because their cytoplasmic kinase domain has weak tyrosine kinase activity but strong &lt;a href=\"serine\"&gt;serine&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"threonine\"&gt;threonine&lt;/a&gt; kinase activity. When a TGF-\u03b2 superfamily ligand binds to the type II receptor, it recruits a type I receptor and activates it by phosphorylating the serine or threonine residues of its \"GS\" box. This forms an activation complex that can then phosphorylate SMAD proteins.\nSMAD pathway.\nThere are three classes of SMADs:\nExamples of SMADs in each class:\nThe TGF-\u03b2 superfamily activates members of the &lt;a href=\"SMAD%20%28protein%29\"&gt;SMAD&lt;/a&gt; family, which function as transcription factors. Specifically, the type I receptor, activated by the type II receptor, phosphorylates &lt;a href=\"R-SMAD\"&gt;R-SMAD&lt;/a&gt;s that then bind to the co-SMAD, &lt;a href=\"mothers%20against%20decapentaplegic%20homolog%204\"&gt;SMAD4&lt;/a&gt;. The R-SMAD/Co-SMAD forms a complex with &lt;a href=\"importin\"&gt;importin&lt;/a&gt; and enters the nucleus, where they act as &lt;a href=\"transcription%20factor\"&gt;transcription factor&lt;/a&gt;s and either up-regulate or down-regulate in the expression of a target gene.\nSpecific TGF-\u03b2 ligands will result in the activation of either the SMAD2/3 or the SMAD1/5 &lt;a href=\"R-SMAD\"&gt;R-SMAD&lt;/a&gt;s. For instance, when &lt;a href=\"activin\"&gt;activin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NODAL\"&gt;Nodal&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Transforming%20growth%20factor%20beta\"&gt;TGF-\u03b2 ligand&lt;/a&gt; binds to the receptors, the &lt;a href=\"phosphorylated\"&gt;phosphorylated&lt;/a&gt; receptor complex can activate &lt;a href=\"mothers%20against%20decapentaplegic%20homolog%202\"&gt;SMAD2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mothers%20against%20decapentaplegic%20homolog%203\"&gt;SMAD3&lt;/a&gt; through phosphorylation. However, when a BMP ligand binds to the receptors, the phosphorylated receptor complex activates &lt;a href=\"mothers%20against%20decapentaplegic%20homolog%201\"&gt;SMAD1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mothers%20against%20decapentaplegic%20homolog%205\"&gt;SMAD5&lt;/a&gt;. Then, the Smad2/3 or the Smad1/5 complexes form a dimer complex with &lt;a href=\"mothers%20against%20decapentaplegic%20homolog%204\"&gt;SMAD4&lt;/a&gt; and become &lt;a href=\"transcription%20factors\"&gt;transcription factors&lt;/a&gt;. Though there are many &lt;a href=\"R-SMAD\"&gt;R-SMAD&lt;/a&gt;s involved in the pathway, there is only one co-SMAD, &lt;a href=\"mothers%20against%20decapentaplegic%20homolog%204\"&gt;SMAD4&lt;/a&gt;.\nNon-SMAD pathway.\nNon-Smad signaling proteins contribute to the responses of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway in three ways. First, non-Smad signaling pathways phosphorylate the Smads. Second, Smads directly signal to other pathways by communicating directly with other signaling proteins, such as kinases. Finally, the TGF-\u03b2 receptors directly phosphorylate non-Smad proteins.\nMembers of TGF-\u03b2 superfamily.\n1. TGF-\u03b2 family.\nThis family includes &lt;a href=\"TGF%CE%B21\"&gt;TGF-\u03b21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TGF%CE%B22\"&gt;TGF-\u03b22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TGF%CE%B23\"&gt;TGF-\u03b23&lt;/a&gt;, and TGF-\u03b25. They are involved in positively and negatively regulation of &lt;a href=\"cell%20division\"&gt;cell division&lt;/a&gt;, the formation of the &lt;a href=\"extracellular%20matrix\"&gt;extracellular matrix&lt;/a&gt; between cells, &lt;a href=\"apoptosis\"&gt;apoptosis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"embryogenesis\"&gt;embryogenesis&lt;/a&gt;. They bind to &lt;a href=\"TGF-beta%20receptor%20type-2\"&gt;TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor&lt;/a&gt; (TGFBRII).\nTGF-\u03b21 stimulates the synthesis of &lt;a href=\"collagen\"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fibronectin\"&gt;fibronectin&lt;/a&gt; and inhibits the degradation of the &lt;a href=\"extracellular%20matrix\"&gt;extracellular matrix&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, it increases the production of extracellular matrix by &lt;a href=\"epithelial%20cells\"&gt;epithelial cells&lt;/a&gt;.\nTGF-\u03b2 proteins regulate epithelia by controlling where and when they branch to form kidney, lung, and salivary gland ducts.\n2. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMPs) family.\nMembers of the BMP family were originally found to induce &lt;a href=\"bone%20formation\"&gt;bone formation&lt;/a&gt;, as their name suggests. However, BMPs are very multifunctional and can also regulate &lt;a href=\"apoptosis\"&gt;apoptosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cell%20migration\"&gt;cell migration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cell%20division\"&gt;cell division&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cellular%20differentiation\"&gt;differentiation&lt;/a&gt;. They also specify the anterior/posterior axis, induce growth, and regulate &lt;a href=\"homeostasis\"&gt;homeostasis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe BMPs bind to the &lt;a href=\"BMPR2\"&gt;bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II&lt;/a&gt; (BMPR2). Some of the proteins of the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20morphogenetic%20protein\"&gt;BMP&lt;/a&gt; family are &lt;a href=\"BMP4\"&gt;BMP4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"BMP7\"&gt;BMP7&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"BMP4\"&gt;BMP4&lt;/a&gt; promotes bone formation, causes cell death, or signals the formation of &lt;a href=\"epidermis%20%28skin%29\"&gt;epidermis&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the tissue it is acting on. &lt;a href=\"BMP7\"&gt;BMP7&lt;/a&gt; is crucial for kidney development, sperm synthesis, and neural tube polarization. Both &lt;a href=\"BMP4\"&gt;BMP4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"BMP7\"&gt;BMP7&lt;/a&gt; regulate mature ligand stability and processing, including degrading ligands in lysosomes. BMPs act by diffusing from the cells that create them.\nExamples.\n&lt;a href=\"Growth%20factor\"&gt;Growth factor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"clotting%20factor\"&gt;clotting factor&lt;/a&gt;s are paracrine signaling agents. The local action of growth factor signaling plays an especially important role in the development of tissues. Also, &lt;a href=\"retinoic%20acid\"&gt;retinoic acid&lt;/a&gt;, the active form of &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20A\"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, functions in a paracrine fashion to regulate gene expression during embryonic development in higher animals. \nIn insects, &lt;a href=\"Allatostatin\"&gt;Allatostatin&lt;/a&gt; controls growth through paracrine action on the corpora allata.\nIn mature organisms, paracrine signaling is involved in responses to &lt;a href=\"allergen\"&gt;allergen&lt;/a&gt;s, tissue repair, the formation of &lt;a href=\"scar\"&gt;scar tissue&lt;/a&gt;, and blood &lt;a href=\"clotting\"&gt;clotting&lt;/a&gt;."
