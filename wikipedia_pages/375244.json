    "text": "Puuc is the name of either a region in the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20state\"&gt;Mexican state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yucat%C3%A1n%20%28state%29\"&gt;Yucat\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Maya%20architecture\"&gt;Maya architectural&lt;/a&gt; style prevalent in that region. The word \"puuc\" is derived from the Maya term for \"&lt;a href=\"hill\"&gt;hill&lt;/a&gt;\". Since the Yucat\u00e1n is relatively flat, this term was extended to encompass the large &lt;a href=\"karst\"&gt;karst&lt;/a&gt;ic range of hills in the southern portion of the state, hence, the terms Puuc region or Puuc hills. The Puuc hills extend into northern &lt;a href=\"Campeche\"&gt;Campeche&lt;/a&gt; and western &lt;a href=\"Quintana%20Roo\"&gt;Quintana Roo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term Puuc is also used to designate the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20architecture\"&gt;architectural style&lt;/a&gt; of ancient Maya sites located within the Puuc hills, hence, the term Puuc architecture. This architectural style began at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20chronology%23Late%20Classic\"&gt;Late Classic&lt;/a&gt; period but experienced its greatest extent during the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20chronology%23Terminal%20Classic\"&gt;Terminal Classic&lt;/a&gt; period.\nPuuc architecture.\nIn the florescence of Puuc architecture (such as at the ancient &lt;a href=\"Maya%20civilization\"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt; site of &lt;a href=\"Uxmal\"&gt;Uxmal&lt;/a&gt;) buildings were decorated with carefully cut &lt;a href=\"Stone%20veneer\"&gt;veneer&lt;/a&gt; stones set into a &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; core. The lower portion of the &lt;a href=\"fa%C3%A7ade\"&gt;fa\u00e7ade&lt;/a&gt;s are blank with a flat surface of rectangular blocks punctuated by doorways, while the upper fa\u00e7ade is richly decorated with intricate stone &lt;a href=\"mosaic\"&gt;mosaic&lt;/a&gt;s, often alternating repeated geometric elements with more elaborate figurative sculpture. Long-nosed masks (commonly believed to be of the Maya rain god &lt;a href=\"Chaac\"&gt;Chaac&lt;/a&gt;) are found on many Puuc buildings.\nBeyond the impressive decorative elements of Puuc architecture, the use of a concrete core is also considered an architectural advance beyond the earlier Maya technique of using larger stones (set on top of one another in lime and mud mortar) for structural support. The concrete core-veneer &lt;a href=\"masonry\"&gt;masonry&lt;/a&gt; allowed for slightly larger and more stable interior rooms. Many &lt;a href=\"corbelled%20arch\"&gt;corbelled vaults&lt;/a&gt; in the Puuc style remain standing, even when most of the veneer stones have fallen away.\nThe most famous of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Maya%20sites\"&gt;Maya sites&lt;/a&gt; exhibiting the Puuc architectural style is &lt;a href=\"Uxmal\"&gt;Uxmal&lt;/a&gt;; other major Puuc-style sites in the region include &lt;a href=\"Labna\"&gt;Labna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kabah%2C%20Yucat%C3%A1n\"&gt;Kabah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sayil\"&gt;Sayil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xlapak\"&gt;Xlapak&lt;/a&gt;. The architectural style is also seen at &lt;a href=\"Kiuic\"&gt;Kiuic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolonchen\"&gt;Bolonchen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chunhuhub\"&gt;Chunhuhub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xculoc\"&gt;Xculoc&lt;/a&gt;, and many smaller ruins. The transition from earlier Classic Period architecture to Puuc style core-veneer masonry is well documented at the site of &lt;a href=\"Oxkintok\"&gt;Oxkintok&lt;/a&gt;. To the south, the style can be found in &lt;a href=\"Edzn%C3%A1\"&gt;Edzn\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;; and to the east at &lt;a href=\"Chichen%20Itza\"&gt;Chichen Itza&lt;/a&gt; (outside of the Puuc Hills region).\nAs stated by the Maya explorer Teobert Maler, who explored this zone intensively, the area around the site of Dolores is full of ruins. The recently completed Chunhuaymil project compiled data of the remaining Puuc architecture of 19 archaeological sites located in a 100 square kilometers area.\nPuuc Biocultural State Reserve.\nPuuc Biocultural State Reserve, also known as Kaxil Kiuic reserve (&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; \"Reserva Estatal Biocultural del Puuc\") was designated in 2011. It covers an area of 1358.93 km\u00b2. The reserve was created to protect the region's archeological sites as well as its biodiverse flora and fauna. The reserve is home to 247 bird, 63 mammal, 52 reptile, and 14 amphibian species. Five species of large felines, including &lt;a href=\"jaguar\"&gt;jaguar&lt;/a&gt;s, live in the reserve."
