    "text": "James Finn Jr. (born December 9, 1976) is a former &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fullback%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;fullback&lt;/a&gt;. He was &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Draft\"&gt;drafted&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bears\"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt; with the final pick of the &lt;a href=\"1999%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1999 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;.

An All-State pick in both sports, he was the 189-pound class state champion and posted a 33\u20132 record as a senior. Because no &lt;a href=\"Division%20I-A\"&gt;Division I-A&lt;/a&gt; recruiters were seeking him, Finn sought a &lt;a href=\"Division%20I-AA\"&gt;Division I-AA&lt;/a&gt; program and committed with the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollege career.\nFinn was a four-year &lt;a href=\"Letterman%20%28sports%29\"&gt;letterman&lt;/a&gt; while playing &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, where he accumulated 2,277 rushing yards, which ranks as the fourth-highest total in school history. He also scored 180 points for fifth on the all-time list. He was an All-&lt;a href=\"Ivy%20League\"&gt;Ivy League&lt;/a&gt; player as a senior and junior. In his senior season, Finn set school records for yards, rushing attempts, and rushing touchdowns.\n&lt;a href=\"Penn%20Quakers%20football\"&gt;Penn&lt;/a&gt; first experimented with having Finn play both offense and defense on October 18, 1997, against &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Lions%20football\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. In that game, Finn ran for 138 yards on 24 carries including one touchdown for 15 yards but fumbled on Columbia's 3-yard line on a 50-yard run. With the 24\u20137 win, Penn beat Columbia for the first time since 1994.\nIn addition to being named an All-Ivy Team member, Finn was named Player of the Year. He also holds school records for most rushing attempts, rushing yards, and touchdowns in a game. Before being converted permanently into a fullback, Finn briefly played as a &lt;a href=\"Safety%20%28American%20football%20position%29\"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt;, even starting a few games as a sophomore. While at Penn, Finn became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Sigma%20Chi\"&gt;Sigma Chi&lt;/a&gt; fraternity. Finn also attended the &lt;a href=\"Wharton%20School\"&gt;Wharton School&lt;/a&gt; at Penn and graduated with a degree in &lt;a href=\"finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; in 1999.\nProfessional career.\nPlaying history.\nFinn was drafted with the final pick of the &lt;a href=\"1999%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1999 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; (nicknamed &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Irrelevant\"&gt;Mr. Irrelevant&lt;/a&gt;) by the Chicago Bears. He was waived and spent time on their practice squad. Finn signed with the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Colts\"&gt;Indianapolis Colts&lt;/a&gt; in early 2000 where he ran for 44 yards in six rushing attempts and 10 receptions over three seasons. In 2003, Finn signed with the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;. In his Giants career, Finn had seven rushing yards from three attempts. He saw more action as a receiver out of the backfield, with 325 receiving yards and 42 receptions.\nIn 2005, Finn played in all 16 regular season games with 13 starts including the NFC &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League%20playoffs\"&gt;National Football League playoffs&lt;/a&gt; wild card game against the &lt;a href=\"Carolina%20Panthers\"&gt;Carolina Panthers&lt;/a&gt;. His blocks for &lt;a href=\"Tiki%20Barber\"&gt;Tiki Barber&lt;/a&gt; helped Barber rush for a franchise-record 1,860 yards. Finn was primarily a blocking fullback for the Giants.\nFinn missed the entire &lt;a href=\"2007%20New%20York%20Giants%20season\"&gt;2007 New York Giants season&lt;/a&gt; after being placed on &lt;a href=\"injured%20reserve\"&gt;injured reserve&lt;/a&gt;. That year, he became a Super Bowl champion when the Giants won &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XLII\"&gt;Super Bowl XLII&lt;/a&gt;. After the season, Finn was cut due to nagging injuries and the emergence of &lt;a href=\"Madison%20Hedgecock\"&gt;Madison Hedgecock&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinn and &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Stokley\"&gt;Brandon Stokley&lt;/a&gt; are the only players in NFL history to have caught a pass from both Eli Manning and &lt;a href=\"Peyton%20Manning\"&gt;Peyton Manning&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nHe is the son of James and Jane Finn. Finn married actress &lt;a href=\"Rosa%20Blasi\"&gt;Rosa Blasi&lt;/a&gt; on February 14, 2004, in &lt;a href=\"Maui\"&gt;Maui&lt;/a&gt;. They had one child and divorced in 2008.\nFinn is a resident in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles County, California&lt;/a&gt;. He has also lived in Fair Lawn, New Jersey.\nFinn was a named plaintiff in one of the lawsuits filed by former NFL players against the league, alleging that the NFL had failed to warn its players about the risk of long term damage from repeated &lt;a href=\"Concussions%20in%20American%20football\"&gt;concussions incurred from playing football&lt;/a&gt;."
