    "text": "Calamovilfa longifolia is a species of &lt;a href=\"Poaceae\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; known by the &lt;a href=\"common%20name\"&gt;common name&lt;/a&gt;s prairie sandreed and sand reedgrass. It is native to North America, where it occurs from the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Territories\"&gt;Northwest Territories&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; in Canada and as far south as &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. There are two &lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28botany%29\"&gt;varieties&lt;/a&gt;, var. \"longifolia\" being widespread in the species' range and var. \"magna\" being native to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes\"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; region.\nThis species is a perennial grass with long, leafy &lt;a href=\"rhizome\"&gt;rhizome&lt;/a&gt;s which hold the soil, forming &lt;a href=\"sod\"&gt;sod&lt;/a&gt;. The roots may reach deep in the soil. The stems are up to tall and can form colonies up to in diameter. Each stem has up to 12 leaves up to long by wide. The leaves tend to roll up during dry conditions. The &lt;a href=\"inflorescence\"&gt;inflorescence&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"panicle\"&gt;panicle&lt;/a&gt; up to long. The spikelet is pale and shiny. The fruit is a &lt;a href=\"caryopsis\"&gt;caryopsis&lt;/a&gt; a few millimeters in length which has a ring of long hairs around its base. These help the seeds &lt;a href=\"seed%20dispersal\"&gt;disperse&lt;/a&gt; on the wind. The plant may reproduce &lt;a href=\"sexual%20reproduction\"&gt;sexually&lt;/a&gt; via seed, but most of its reproduction is &lt;a href=\"vegetative%20reproduction\"&gt;vegetative&lt;/a&gt; as the plant sprouts from the starchy tips of its rhizomes. Plants growing in moist, disturbed habitat and recently burned areas are most likely to produce seeds.\nThis grass occurs in several types of habitat, including many types of &lt;a href=\"grassland\"&gt;grassland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"prairie\"&gt;prairie&lt;/a&gt;, pine and hardwood forest, sagebrush, and &lt;a href=\"pinyon-juniper%20woodland\"&gt;pinyon-juniper woodland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dune\"&gt;dune&lt;/a&gt;s such as those on the margins of the Great Lakes. The plant grows in climates featuring hot summers, cold winters, and moderate precipitation. It is a &lt;a href=\"dominance%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;dominant&lt;/a&gt; grass species in many regions, including the &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Hills%20%28Nebraska%29\"&gt;Nebraska Sand Hills&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"sandhill\"&gt;sand hills&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20River%20Valley\"&gt;Red River Valley&lt;/a&gt;, many prairies and grasslands of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Plains\"&gt;Great Plains&lt;/a&gt;, and certain beaches along the Great Lakes, such as those at &lt;a href=\"Kohler-Andrae%20State%20Park\"&gt;Kohler-Andrae State Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Point%20Beach%20State%20Forest\"&gt;Point Beach State Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough it is not one of the most palatable or nutritious grasses, this species is an important &lt;a href=\"forage\"&gt;forage&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; in sand hills regions. It begins growth earlier in the season than many other grasses. Some species of wildlife utilize it for food, such as &lt;a href=\"California%20quail\"&gt;California quail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pocket%20gopher\"&gt;pocket gopher&lt;/a&gt;s. Waterfowl and &lt;a href=\"black-tailed%20prairie%20dog\"&gt;black-tailed prairie dog&lt;/a&gt;s use it for cover.\nThis grass is useful for stabilizing soil and preventing erosion because its robust rhizome easily holds loose, sandy soils. It can be used in &lt;a href=\"revegetation\"&gt;revegetation&lt;/a&gt; efforts in disturbed habitat with sandy substrates, such as &lt;a href=\"Blowout%20%28geology%29\"&gt;blowouts&lt;/a&gt;. A number of &lt;a href=\"cultivar\"&gt;cultivar&lt;/a&gt;s have been developed, including 'Goshen' and 'Pronghorn'. Pests of the grass include &lt;a href=\"grasshopper\"&gt;grasshopper&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Rust%20%28fungus%29\"&gt;rust fungus&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Puccinia%20amphigena\"&gt;Puccinia amphigena&lt;/a&gt;\"."
