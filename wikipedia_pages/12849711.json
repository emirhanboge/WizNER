    "text": "Anatosuchus (\"duck crocodile\", the name from the &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; \"anas\" (\"duck\") and the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; \"souchos\" (\"crocodile\"), for the broad, duck-like snout) is an &lt;a href=\"extinct\"&gt;extinct&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"notosuchia\"&gt;notosuchia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Crocodylomorpha\"&gt;crocodylomorph&lt;/a&gt; discovered in Gadoufaoua, &lt;a href=\"Niger\"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;, and described by a team of &lt;a href=\"palaeontologists\"&gt;palaeontologists&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paul%20C.%20Sereno\"&gt;Paul Sereno&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, in the \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Vertebrate%20Paleontology\"&gt;Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology&lt;/a&gt;\". Its duck-like snout coincidentally makes it resemble a &lt;a href=\"crocoduck\"&gt;crocoduck&lt;/a&gt;, an imagined hybrid animal with the head of a crocodile and the body of a duck.\nSpecies and discovery.\nThe type species of \"Anatosuchus\" is \"A. minor\", in reference to its small body size. The &lt;a href=\"holotype\"&gt;holotype&lt;/a&gt; material (MNN GDF603), is a nearly complete skull with articulated lower jaws, belonging to a juvenile. It was discovered from the upper portion of the &lt;a href=\"Elrhaz%20Formation\"&gt;Elrhaz Formation&lt;/a&gt; and lower portion of &lt;a href=\"Echkar%20Formation\"&gt;Echkar Formation&lt;/a&gt;, indicating an &lt;a href=\"Early%20Cretaceous\"&gt;Early Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt; (Late Aptian or Early Albian) age. Another specimen was found later (MNN GAD17) belonging to an adult, which had both the skull and much of the postcranial skeleton. Differences in the skull indicate that the unusual broad, flattened shape developed as the animal grew older.\nSystematics.\nIn the initial description of \"Anatosuchus\", it formed a &lt;a href=\"clade\"&gt;clade&lt;/a&gt; with \"&lt;a href=\"Comahuesuchus\"&gt;Comahuesuchus&lt;/a&gt;\", within a less inclusive &lt;a href=\"Notosuchia\"&gt;Notosuchia&lt;/a&gt;, also found to be monophyletic. However, further work proposed that \"Anatosuchus\" is not closely related to \"Comahuesuchus\", but instead is a member of &lt;a href=\"Uruguaysuchidae\"&gt;Uruguaysuchidae&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nSkull and jaws.\nThe &lt;a href=\"premaxilla\"&gt;premaxilla&lt;/a&gt;e are broad and flat, and form a line straight across the front of \"Anatosuchus\"'s &lt;a href=\"snout\"&gt;snout&lt;/a&gt;; each holds six recurved &lt;a href=\"Tooth\"&gt;teeth&lt;/a&gt; which point backwards into the mouth. The internarial processes of the premaxillae taper steeply up towards the projecting &lt;a href=\"Nasal%20bone\"&gt;nasals&lt;/a&gt;; they begin as very wide, meaning that the &lt;a href=\"Nostril\"&gt;external nares&lt;/a&gt; are dorsoventrally compressed. The premaxillae also form the floor of the &lt;a href=\"Nasal%20passages\"&gt;narial passages&lt;/a&gt;, including a small flange which causes the nares to point up and out somewhat. This gives \"Anatosuchus\" a visible projecting nose on the front of its broad snout. The smooth narial fossae are located just behind these, and help to give the snout its broad flattened look.\nThe &lt;a href=\"maxilla\"&gt;maxilla&lt;/a&gt;e are, by quite a long way, the largest and most expansive bones in the skull; each holds nineteen small recurved teeth. They have a narrow &lt;a href=\"Alveolar%20ridge\"&gt;alveolar margin&lt;/a&gt; at the edge of their broad expanse, giving the head of \"Anatosuchus\" a rather rectangular appearance, and broad rami that extend above and below the &lt;a href=\"Antorbital%20fenestra\"&gt;antorbital opening&lt;/a&gt;. The upper of these rami form a long suture with the nasal, and then meet the &lt;a href=\"Prefrontal%20bone\"&gt;prefrontal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lacrimal%20bone\"&gt;lacrimal&lt;/a&gt; directly above the antorbital fenestra. The alveolar margin is vertically oriented, but runs anteroposteriorly rather than transversely as that of the premaxilla does. The maxilla is quite highly textured with pits and neurovascular canals, although far less than the nasal, &lt;a href=\"Frontal%20bone\"&gt;frontal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"parietal%20bone\"&gt;parietal bone&lt;/a&gt;s in particular.\nThe maxillae also form much of the &lt;a href=\"palate\"&gt;palate&lt;/a&gt;, particularly at the anterior section of the palate; the &lt;a href=\"palatine%20bone\"&gt;palatine bone&lt;/a&gt;s form almost all the remainder. The median one-third (measured transversely from left to right) is arched dorsally, making the &lt;a href=\"Buccal%20space\"&gt;buccal cavity&lt;/a&gt; larger, whereas the two lateral thirds by this measure are horizontal. There is a slit-shaped foramen on each maxilla on the palate. The very posterior section is formed by the &lt;a href=\"Pterygoid%20bone\"&gt;pterygoid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ectopterygoid\"&gt;ectopterygoid&lt;/a&gt;; these also form the projecting posteroventral &lt;a href=\"Mandibular%20ramus\"&gt;mandibular rami&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"choana\"&gt;choana&lt;/a&gt;e are as far back as possible without contacting the &lt;a href=\"suborbital%20fenestrae\"&gt;suborbital fenestrae&lt;/a&gt;; there is a thin &lt;a href=\"choanal%20septum\"&gt;choanal septum&lt;/a&gt; between them where they emerge in the pterygoids.\nThe nasal bones are quite long, and sutured together along their whole length; they begin just behind the internarial bar where the premaxillae meet, and end with two processes beneath the frontal bone. The lacrimal bones are L-shaped, with one ramus projecting forwards to meet the maxilla and one ramus projecting downwards to form part of the orbit. The lacrimal also has a small process for articulating with a &lt;a href=\"Palpebral%20%28bone%29\"&gt;palpebral&lt;/a&gt;, which projects out over the &lt;a href=\"Orbit%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;orbit&lt;/a&gt;; although the palpebrals are disarticulated, they have fallen into orbits and so can be examined. Both anterior and posterior palpebrals were present above each orbit. The &lt;a href=\"prefrontal%20bone\"&gt;prefrontal bone&lt;/a&gt;s are shaped rather like a stylised capital I, wider at each of the ends, and effectively separate the nasals and lacrimals.\nThe frontal bones are fused into one large bone, as are the parietals. The frontal-parietal suture is strong and highly &lt;a href=\"Interdigitating%20suture\"&gt;interdigitating&lt;/a&gt;; although the frontals bear a medial crest, the parietal skull table is flat save for the deep pits across it. In the juvenile specimen, the interorbital width is less than the width across the skull table (between the two &lt;a href=\"supratemporal%20fenestra\"&gt;supratemporal fenestra&lt;/a&gt;e), but in the adult interorbital width is almost twice skull table width. The supratemporal fenestrae have distinctive corners in them, formed by projections of the frontal bone. This feature seems to have occurred as the animal grew older. The &lt;a href=\"postorbital%20bone\"&gt;postorbital bone&lt;/a&gt;s are small and slightly curved; they possess articulations for the posterior palpebral.\nThe &lt;a href=\"squamosal%20bone\"&gt;squamosal bone&lt;/a&gt;s, right at the back and top of the skull, are triradiate, with slender anterior processes that contact the postorbitals and offset posterior processes that dip down to the &lt;a href=\"Neurocranium\"&gt;braincase&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Jugal%20bone\"&gt;jugals&lt;/a&gt; have relatively long anterior rami, but not long enough to contact the antorbital fossae. There is a small oval fossa located beneath each orbit. The &lt;a href=\"Quadratojugal%20bone\"&gt;quadratojugals&lt;/a&gt; are partially fused to the &lt;a href=\"Quadrate%20bone\"&gt;quadrates&lt;/a&gt; close to their &lt;a href=\"condyle\"&gt;condyle&lt;/a&gt;s, but do not form part of any jaw articulation. The quadrates are angled posteroventrally from the otic region to their condyles.\nThe braincase is quite well preserved. The &lt;a href=\"supraoccipitals\"&gt;supraoccipitals&lt;/a&gt; are small and triangular, with a short vertical nuchal keel on the occiput; large flanges extend off this to each side. The paraoccipital processes, which contact both the squamosals and the quadrate condyles, are marked with a series of striations. The &lt;a href=\"occipital%20condyles\"&gt;occipital condyles&lt;/a&gt; are ventrally deflected and are formed almost entirely by the &lt;a href=\"basioccipital\"&gt;basioccipital&lt;/a&gt;s. Each side of the skull has three &lt;a href=\"Eustachian%20tube\"&gt;Eustachian foramina&lt;/a&gt; present - two on each basioccipital, one anterior and one posterior, and one between &lt;a href=\"basisphenoid\"&gt;basisphenoid&lt;/a&gt; and otoccipital in the &lt;a href=\"basal%20tuber\"&gt;basal tuber&lt;/a&gt;. A pair of crests runs between the quadrate and the pterygoid on each lateral side of the braincase.\nThe lower jaw is U-shaped, to match the upper jaw; the &lt;a href=\"dentary\"&gt;dentary&lt;/a&gt; bears twenty-one teeth on each side. The dentary becomes broader transversely than dorsoventrally as it turns the corners of the U-shape, due to wide and vascularised dentary shelves and alveolar margins. The two dentary bones are interdigitating at their &lt;a href=\"Mandibular%20symphysis\"&gt;symphysis&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that the lower jaw is entirely inflexible. The dentary projects somewhat posteriorly, forming the edge of the external &lt;a href=\"mandibular%20fenestra\"&gt;mandibular fenestra&lt;/a&gt;. Both &lt;a href=\"Angular%20bone\"&gt;angular&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"surangular\"&gt;surangular&lt;/a&gt; extend to the top of the &lt;a href=\"Coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible\"&gt;coronid process&lt;/a&gt;, and the surangular forms much of the jaw articulation. The &lt;a href=\"Articular%20bone\"&gt;articular&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"Mandibular%20fossa\"&gt;glenoid&lt;/a&gt; for the quadrate condyles; it is saddle-shaped, with no anterior or posterior lip, although there is a prominent attachment crest posteroventral to the jaw joint.\nThe teeth have subconical crowns that curve in towards the centre of the mouth; all are fairly small and not very worn, indicating relatively little use. Most of the teeth have small &lt;a href=\"carinae\"&gt;carinae&lt;/a&gt; present on their surfaces. The dentary sypmhysis has no teeth present to either side of it for 11\u00a0mm, but forms a sharpish edge which may have been used with the premaxillary teeth 1-3 for cutting into prey. The largest teeth are found at the corners of the skull.\nVertebral column, ribs and osteoderms.\n\"Anatosuchus\" has a &lt;a href=\"proatlas%20vertebra\"&gt;proatlas vertebra&lt;/a&gt;, eight &lt;a href=\"cervical%20vertebrae\"&gt;cervical vertebrae&lt;/a&gt; and probably 16 &lt;a href=\"dorsal%20vertebrae\"&gt;dorsal vertebrae&lt;/a&gt;, though only 15 are preserved. There are also two &lt;a href=\"sacral%20vertebrae\"&gt;sacral vertebrae&lt;/a&gt;. The dorsal vertebrae are amphicoelous, while the cervical centra lack &lt;a href=\"hypapophyses\"&gt;hypapophyses&lt;/a&gt;. The proatlas is an inverted V-shaped piece of bone with a dorsal keel and is quite large relative to the &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;atlas&lt;/a&gt;, which is made up of two separate neural arches. The &lt;a href=\"Axis%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;axis&lt;/a&gt; has a low, subrectangular neural spine; &lt;a href=\"neural%20spines\"&gt;neural spines&lt;/a&gt; grow taller along the cervical vertebrae, with that of the third cervical vertebra being twice as tall as long and that of the seventh being almost five times as tall as long. The dorsal vertebrae are relatively long compared to their width, with length always more than half the width across the transverse processes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rib%20cage\"&gt;ribs&lt;/a&gt; of the atlas and axis vertebrae are straight, whereas those of the other cervical vertebrae are short and triradiate. Dorsal ribs bend ventrally after they clear the osteoderm shield, forming a slight flange along the anterior margin; the ones closer to the posterior end have only one head. The &lt;a href=\"Gastralium\"&gt;gastralia&lt;/a&gt; are quite poorly preserved between the girdles.\n&lt;a href=\"Osteoderm\"&gt;Osteoderm&lt;/a&gt;s appear only to have been present on the dorsal surface; they were in pairs sutured together, each pair corresponding to one dorsal vertebra or up to three cervical ones. The articulation between rows is minimal, limited to a slight overlap between rows next to each other. The osteoderms are trapezoidal in shape and quite pitted; they articulate via a facet in the centre of the suture with their corresponding vertebra, the top of the neural spine of which fits into the facet.\nLimbs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"scapula\"&gt;scapula&lt;/a&gt;e are quite broad, but do not flare very widely at the distal end of the blade, which is tucked under the osteoderms. The &lt;a href=\"coracoid\"&gt;coracoid&lt;/a&gt;s are highly elongated. The &lt;a href=\"Humerus\"&gt;humeri&lt;/a&gt; are long and have straight shafts; they are quite slender, with the width less than 10% of the length. The fossae on them where the &lt;a href=\"olecranon%20processes\"&gt;olecranon processes&lt;/a&gt; would fit are strongly developed, suggesting that the legs could be held quite straight. The &lt;a href=\"Radius%20%28bone%29\"&gt;radii&lt;/a&gt; have strongly flared proximal ends, and are noticeably shorter than the &lt;a href=\"ulna\"&gt;ulna&lt;/a&gt;e since these extend along the edges of the &lt;a href=\"Radiale%20externum\"&gt;radiales&lt;/a&gt;. The ulnae are relatively curved. The radiales are strong, heavy bones, almost as wide as the radii, while the ulnares are poorly preserved. The &lt;a href=\"Hand\"&gt;manus&lt;/a&gt; are very large, and have strange fourth digits; each one has six &lt;a href=\"Phalanx%20bone\"&gt;phalanges&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the normal four, although the total length is still only around 80% of that of the other digits. This is mainly due to their elongated &lt;a href=\"ungual\"&gt;ungual&lt;/a&gt;s. which have a narrow attachment groove along their length and are quite strongly arched. It is not known what benefit these specialised features conferred.\nPalaeobiology.\nAs the specific name indicates, \"A. minor\" was a very small crocodylomorph, with an adult body length estimated at around 70 centimeters. It had a very broad, duck-like snout. Despite its appearance it is considered to have a diet of small, aquatic creatures, and to get them it may have waded in water like a &lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;heron&lt;/a&gt;."
