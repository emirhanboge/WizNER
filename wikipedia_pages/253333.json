    "text": "'Golden Delicious' is a &lt;a href=\"cultivar\"&gt;cultivar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the 15 most popular cultivars in the United States. It is not closely related to '&lt;a href=\"Red%20Delicious\"&gt;Red Delicious&lt;/a&gt;'.\nHistory.\nGolden Delicious arose from a &lt;a href=\"chance%20seedling\"&gt;chance seedling&lt;/a&gt;, possibly a hybrid of '&lt;a href=\"Grimes%20Golden\"&gt;Grimes Golden&lt;/a&gt;' and '&lt;a href=\"Golden%20Reinette\"&gt;Golden Reinette&lt;/a&gt;'. The original tree was found on the Mullins' family farm in &lt;a href=\"Clay%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Clay County, West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, United States, and was locally known as Mullin's Yellow Seedling and Annit apple. Anderson Mullins sold the tree and propagation rights to &lt;a href=\"Stark%20Brothers%20Nurseries\"&gt;Stark Brothers Nurseries&lt;/a&gt; for $5000, which first marketed it as a companion of their &lt;a href=\"Red%20Delicious\"&gt;Red Delicious&lt;/a&gt; in 1914.\nIn 2010, an Italian-led consortium announced they had decoded the complete genome of the 'Golden Delicious' apple. It had the highest number of genes (57,000) of any plant genome studied to date.\n'Golden Delicious' was designated the official state fruit of &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; by a Senate resolution on February 20, 1995. Clay County has hosted an annual Golden Delicious Festival since 1972.\nOther West Virginia apples include &lt;a href=\"Grimes%20Golden\"&gt;Grimes Golden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Guyandotte%20%28apple%29\"&gt;Guyandotte&lt;/a&gt;, which is believed extinct.\n'Golden Delicious' was one of four apples honored by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Postal%20Service\"&gt;United States Postal Service&lt;/a&gt; in a 2013 set of four 33\u00a2 stamps commemorating historic strains, joined by '&lt;a href=\"Northern%20Spy%20%28apple%29\"&gt;Northern Spy&lt;/a&gt;', '&lt;a href=\"Baldwin%20%28apple%29\"&gt;Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;', and '&lt;a href=\"Granny%20Smith\"&gt;Granny Smith&lt;/a&gt;'.\nAppearance and flavor.\n'Golden Delicious' is a large, yellowish-green skinned cultivar and very sweet to the &lt;a href=\"taste\"&gt;taste&lt;/a&gt;. It is prone to bruising and shriveling, so it needs careful handling and storage. It is a favorite for &lt;a href=\"salad\"&gt;salad&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"apple%20sauce\"&gt;apple sauce&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"apple%20butter\"&gt;apple butter&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason.\n'Golden Delicious' are harvested from fall through winter."
