    "text": "Junction Oval (also known as the St Kilda Cricket Ground or the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20Infrastructure\"&gt;CitiPower&lt;/a&gt; Centre due to &lt;a href=\"Naming%20rights\"&gt;sponsorship&lt;/a&gt; reasons) is a historic sports ground in the suburb of &lt;a href=\"St%20Kilda%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;St Kilda&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, Australia. Its location near the &lt;a href=\"St%20Kilda%20Junction\"&gt;St Kilda Junction&lt;/a&gt; gave rise to its name. It is located approximately five kilometres from the centre of Melbourne and is in the southernmost part of the large &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Park%20and%20Lake\"&gt;Albert Park&lt;/a&gt; sporting precinct.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, the oval underwent a $40 million redevelopment designed to make it the administrative headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Cricket%20Victoria\"&gt;Cricket Victoria&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nJunction Oval was established on its present site in 1856. The first &lt;a href=\"grandstand\"&gt;grandstand&lt;/a&gt; at the ground was purchased from the old &lt;a href=\"Elsternwick%20Park\"&gt;Elsternwick racecourse&lt;/a&gt; and erected in 1892 at the southern end of the ground. A new grandstand was built in 1925\u20136 at a cost of \u00a37000, designed by the architect E J Clark and built by H H Eilenberg. It was originally called the G P Newman Stand but has been renamed the &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Murray%20%28Australian%20footballer%29\"&gt;Kevin Murray&lt;/a&gt; Stand after one of the &lt;a href=\"Fitzroy%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Fitzroy Football Club&lt;/a&gt;'s most famous footballers. A second brick stand designed by E J Clark to complement the Murray Stand was built by H H Eilenberg in 1933\u20134 at a cost of \u00a37500. It was named the &lt;a href=\"Don%20Blackie\"&gt;Don Blackie&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Bert%20Ironmonger\"&gt;Bert Ironmonger&lt;/a&gt; Stand in honour of the &lt;a href=\"St%20Kilda%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;St Kilda Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt; and Test cricketers. It still functions as a public pavilion. A new \u00a36000 manual scoreboard and kiosk at the northern end of the ground was built in 1956\u20137, the cricket club's centenary year.\nThe current capacity of the ground is 7,000. The scoreboard (built 1954\u201355 by the &lt;a href=\"St%20Kilda%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;St Kilda Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;) is a landmark of the St Kilda Junction area. There are two main heritage grandstands, the &lt;a href=\"Don%20Blackie\"&gt;Blackie&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Bert%20Ironmonger\"&gt;Ironmonger&lt;/a&gt; stand built by the St Kilda Cricket Club (named after two of St Kilda Club's Test cricketers: recently restored and in use), and the &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Murray%20%28Australian%20rules%20footballer%29\"&gt;Kevin Murray&lt;/a&gt; grandstand (named after one of &lt;a href=\"Fitzroy%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Fitzroy&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest footballers: under restoration). The remainder of the ground is terraced asphalt, with grass embankments at the rear. Older structures were demolished during a rationalisation of the ground, after they were declared a fire hazard by the Metropolitan Fire Brigade in 1988. It is a very picturesque venue, with a top-quality turf playing area and a modern backdrop of tall buildings and parkland.\nCricket great &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Warne\"&gt;Shane Warne&lt;/a&gt; has had a long association with the St Kilda Cricket Ground, not only making his first class debut at the ground for Victoria in 1991, but also playing there on numerous occasions between 1989 and 2006 for his club side, St Kilda. Due to these connections, the club began discussions in 2010 to rename the ground the Shane Warne Oval. Though such a change never occurred, Warne has previously spoken on behalf of the campaign to preserve the ground's suitability as a venue for first-class cricket.\nIn December 2014, the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Victoria\"&gt;Victorian Government&lt;/a&gt; announced it would contribute $25 million to the redevelopment of the venue, to allow it to become the administrative and training headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Cricket%20Victoria\"&gt;Cricket Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of 2015, Cricket Victoria and &lt;a href=\"Cricket%20Australia\"&gt;Cricket Australia&lt;/a&gt;, in combination with the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;, contributed the extra $15 million necessary to allow the redevelopment to proceed. The redevelopment of the venue incorporated several new features:\nThe upgraded venue was unveiled ahead of the &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Shield\"&gt;Sheffield Shield&lt;/a&gt; match between &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; on 3 March 2018.\nOn 14 July 2021, the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Stars\"&gt;Melbourne Stars&lt;/a&gt; announced that they would play a Regular Season &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bash%20League\"&gt;Big Bash League&lt;/a&gt; Match at the Venue against the &lt;a href=\"Perth%20Scorchers\"&gt;Perth Scorchers&lt;/a&gt; on 2nd January 2022 as part of their &lt;a href=\"2021-22%20Big%20Bash%20League%20season\"&gt;BBL11 Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. \nCricket.\nJunction Oval was founded in tandem with the &lt;a href=\"St%20Kilda%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;St Kilda Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;, who have called the ground home since its opening in 1856. The club plays in the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Premier%20Cricket\"&gt;Victorian Premier Cricket&lt;/a&gt; competition and has a rich history of success at the venue. Prior to the redevelopment in 2015\u201318, the venue had hosted 28 &lt;a href=\"first-class%20cricket\"&gt;first-class cricket&lt;/a&gt; matches, including 25 &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Shield\"&gt;Sheffield Shield&lt;/a&gt; games. The lack of upgrades to the oval meant that by 2005 the venue failed to meet first-class standards, though in retaining its charm it was compared to the &lt;a href=\"Basin%20Reserve\"&gt;Basin Reserve&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wellington\"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe need for a first-class standard cricket ground in &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the 100,000 seat capacity &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt; (MCG), became increasingly apparent as the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20cricket%20team\"&gt;state team&lt;/a&gt; was forced to host Sheffield Shield finals in interstate locations. Consequently, the redevelopment of the ground in the mid-2010s allowed Victoria and other teams to host matches at an appropriately-sized venue, relieving pressure on the MCG and enabling the oval to become capable of hosting &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Big%20Bash%20League\"&gt;Women's Big Bash League&lt;/a&gt; matches and other cricket competitions where necessary. As well as being the administrative headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Cricket%20Victoria\"&gt;Cricket Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, the venue is referred to as the \"CitiPower Centre\". Prior to redevelopment, Victoria utilised the oval during the 2005\u201306 season when the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt; (MCG) was being prepared for the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;2006 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;. In the early 1990s it was used regularly because of the construction of the Great Southern Stand at the MCG. It also played host to the 2008/09 Sheffield Shield final, won by the Bushrangers, due to the unavailability of the MCG, because of the Bushfire relief concert.\nAs a result of the redevelopment, the Victorian state team plays many home games in the domestic &lt;a href=\"Australian%20domestic%20limited-overs%20cricket%20tournament\"&gt;One-Day Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Shield\"&gt;Sheffield Shield&lt;/a&gt; competitions at the oval. Success at the redeveloped ground came quickly for the Victorians, who won their sixth One-Day Cup and 32nd Sheffield Shield at the Junction Oval during the 2018\u201319 season.\nAustralian rules football.\nWhile the redevelopment of Junction Oval ended the 145-year association of &lt;a href=\"Australian%20rules%20football\"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; with the ground, the venue has a rich football history.\nOn 28 May 1870, the first ever match of football with &lt;a href=\"1870%20Victorian%20football%20season%23Historical%20status\"&gt;historical senior premiership status&lt;/a&gt; was played at the oval between South Yarra and Albert Park, with Albert Park winning by three goals to one.\nAfter entering senior competition, St Kilda played its home matches there in 1874 and 1875, when the club merged with University for one season to form a combined team, \"St Kilda cum University\", due to a lack of players. St Kilda moved to Alpaca Paddock in 1876 after returning as a standalone team, but a lack of players and financial problems meant St Kilda went into recess during 1879, and consequently, no football matches were played there until the Saints returned to competition in 1886.\nThey subsequently played home games at the venue until 1964 (except for in 1916\u201317, when the club was in recess due to World War I, and 1942\u201343, when the military occupied the ground during World War II). Other clubs who used the venue as a home ground included &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Swans\"&gt;South Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; (1944\u20131946) and &lt;a href=\"Fitzroy%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Fitzroy&lt;/a&gt; (1970\u20131984), while the first ever &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20footy\"&gt;women's footy&lt;/a&gt; match was played there in 1921.\nSt Kilda played 564 home matches for premiership points at the ground between 1897 and &lt;a href=\"1964%20VFL%20season\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt;. The Saints' final home game at the venue was on 22 August 1964 \u2013 a 12-point win against &lt;a href=\"Geelong%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Geelong&lt;/a&gt;, 12.18 (90) to 11.12 (78), in front of an attendance of 37,100. The club also played 16 away games at the venue: 13 against the &lt;a href=\"Fitzroy%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Fitzroy&lt;/a&gt; and three against South Melbourne.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"1944%20VFL%20season\"&gt;1944 season&lt;/a&gt;, the military vacated the Junction Oval, and because it was closer to South Melbourne's still-occupied home ground, the Lake Oval, than &lt;a href=\"Princes%20Park%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;Princes Park&lt;/a&gt;, the Swans started playing their home games at the venue. The South Melbourne Football Club played 29 home matches for premiership points at the ground between 1944 and 1946.\nThe Saints left the venue after the 1964 season and moved to &lt;a href=\"Moorabbin%20Oval\"&gt;Moorabbin Oval&lt;/a&gt;, motivated by the desire to operate its own venue.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1970%20VFL%20season\"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt;, Fitzroy relocated to the venue and stayed until the end of 1984. The Fitzroy Football Club played 135 home matches for premiership points at the ground between 1970 and 1984.\nThe ground also hosted six VFL finals matches, including three Grand Finals (in &lt;a href=\"1898%20VFL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;1898&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"1899%20VFL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;1899&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1944%20VFL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;1944&lt;/a&gt;, all three being won by Fitzroy). Between 1870 and 1984, 845 senior matches in the recognized top level of Victorian football \u2013 12 in the unaffiliated era, 99 in the VFA and 734 in the &lt;a href=\"VFL/AFL\"&gt;VFL/AFL&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 were played at the ground over 97 seasons.\nJunction Oval was also a regular venue for &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Victorian Football Association&lt;/a&gt; finals following the Second World War. It staged every top division VFA finals series, including Grand Finals, from &lt;a href=\"1945%20VFA%20season\"&gt;1945&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"1962%20VFA%20season\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"1966%20VFA%20season\"&gt;1966&lt;/a&gt;, and then again from &lt;a href=\"1970%20VFA%20season\"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"1987%20VFA%20season\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sandringham%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Sandringham Football Club&lt;/a&gt; played home games at the ground during the &lt;a href=\"1966%20VFA%20season\"&gt;1966 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Melbourne Football Club&lt;/a&gt; used the venue as a training ground and administrative base between 1985 and 2008, having previously trained at the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt;, and the annual 3RRR &lt;a href=\"Community%20Cup\"&gt;Community Cup&lt;/a&gt; football match was played there until 2007.\nThe last football tenant was the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Amateur%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Victorian Amateur Football Association&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Old%20Melburnians%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Old Melburnians Football Club&lt;/a&gt; from 1992 to 2015, and they took on &lt;a href=\"Caulfield%20Grammarians%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Old Caulfield Grammarians&lt;/a&gt; in the final Australian rules football match to be played at the Junction Oval on 22 July 2015.\nRecord attendances.\nThe record attendance at the ground is 46,973 on 20 May 1950 to watch &lt;a href=\"St%20Kilda%20Football%20Club\"&gt;St Kilda&lt;/a&gt; play &lt;a href=\"Carlton%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Carlton&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Football%20League\"&gt;VFL&lt;/a&gt; match, a bigger crowd than any of the three Grand Finals played at the venue.\nThe record attendance for a South Melbourne home game at the Junction Oval was 38,000 against &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt; in 1946.\nThe record attendance for a Fitzroy home game was 27,202 versus &lt;a href=\"Collingwood%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Collingwood&lt;/a&gt; in the opening round of 1981.\nOther sports.\nOn 3 March 1975, one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time, \"Smokin\" &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Frazier\"&gt;Joe Frazier&lt;/a&gt;, defeated &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Ellis%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Jimmy Ellis&lt;/a&gt; via technical knockout in the 9th round of their scheduled 12 round fight at the Junction Oval, \"to barge squarely back into contention for &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20Ali\"&gt;Muhammad Ali&lt;/a&gt;'s world heavyweight title.\" It was the second time Ellis had fought Frazier; Frazier had won their first fight. Other major events that have been held at the ground include the 1898/99 &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Victorian athletics titles&lt;/a&gt;, numerous bicycle meets and two inter-colonial &lt;a href=\"lacrosse\"&gt;lacrosse&lt;/a&gt; matches between Victoria and New South Wales. A pre-season rugby league trial match between &lt;a href=\"Western%20Suburbs%20Magpies\"&gt;Western Suburbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manly%20Warringah%20Sea%20Eagles\"&gt;Manly Warringah&lt;/a&gt; was staged at the oval in 1978 notable for being the start of the infamous Fibros vs Silvertails rivalry shared between the two sides."
