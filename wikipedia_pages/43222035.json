    "text": "In mathematics, a collapsing algebra is a type of &lt;a href=\"Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29\"&gt;Boolean algebra&lt;/a&gt; sometimes used in &lt;a href=\"Forcing%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;forcing&lt;/a&gt; to reduce (\"collapse\") the size of &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20number\"&gt;cardinals&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"poset\"&gt;poset&lt;/a&gt;s used to generate collapsing algebras were introduced by &lt;a href=\"Azriel%20L%C3%A9vy\"&gt;Azriel L\u00e9vy&lt;/a&gt; in 1963.\nThe collapsing algebra of \u03bb\u03c9 is a &lt;a href=\"complete%20Boolean%20algebra\"&gt;complete Boolean algebra&lt;/a&gt; with at least \u03bb elements but generated by a countable number of elements. As the size of countably generated complete Boolean algebras is unbounded, this shows that there is no &lt;a href=\"Free%20algebra\"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; complete Boolean algebra on a countable number of elements.\nDefinition.\nThere are several slightly different sorts of collapsing algebras. \nIf \u03ba and \u03bb are cardinals, then the Boolean algebra of &lt;a href=\"regular%20open%20set\"&gt;regular open set&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"product%20space\"&gt;product space&lt;/a&gt; \u03ba\u03bb is a collapsing algebra. Here \u03ba and \u03bb are both given the &lt;a href=\"discrete%20topology\"&gt;discrete topology&lt;/a&gt;. There are several different options for the topology of \n\u03ba\u03bb. The simplest option is to take the usual product topology. Another option is to take the topology generated by open sets consisting of functions whose value is specified on less than \u03bb elements of \u03bb."
