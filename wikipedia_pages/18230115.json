    "text": "Piz Umbrail (3,033 m) is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ortler%20Alps\"&gt;Ortler Alps&lt;/a&gt;, south of the &lt;a href=\"Umbrail%20Pass\"&gt;Umbrail Pass&lt;/a&gt; (2,503 m), located on the border between &lt;a href=\"Lombardy\"&gt;Lombardy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Graub%C3%BCnden\"&gt;Graub\u00fcnden&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe mountain surface is partly of rubble and partly covered by grass, and therefore of little interest to mountaineers, but its proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Umbrail%20Pass\"&gt;Umbrail Pass&lt;/a&gt; and accessible surface make it a popular destination for other visitors. In winter it is a relatively easy destination for ski-mountaineers.\nNormal route to the summit.\nThe route starts at the &lt;a href=\"Umbrail%20pass\"&gt;Umbrail pass&lt;/a&gt;, very close to the Swiss border check point. There is a lot of free parking space around. You will need up to 90 minutes from there to the summit. No special equipment is needed, there are a few fixed chains along the route but those are not exposed sections, good marking all the time, and orientation is not a problem.\nAccess roads.\nThere are three roads to the Umbrail pass; two from the Italian and one from the Swiss side. From Italy you have a south road from Bormio, and the road from the north-east which goes over the nearby &lt;a href=\"Stelvio%20pass\"&gt;Stelvio pass&lt;/a&gt;. From the Swiss side you have a road from the &lt;a href=\"Val%20M%C3%BCstair\"&gt;Val M\u00fcstair&lt;/a&gt;."
