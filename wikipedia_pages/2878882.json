    "text": "Politiets Aktionsstyrke (AKS, English: \"The Special Intervention Unit\") is the &lt;a href=\"police%20tactical%20unit\"&gt;police tactical unit&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Rigspolitiet\"&gt;Danish National Police&lt;/a&gt;. It is meant to handle extraordinarily difficult or life-threatening criminal situations, such as &lt;a href=\"terrorism\"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hostage%20situation\"&gt;hostage situation&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"kidnapping\"&gt;kidnapping&lt;/a&gt;. It also deals with emergency rescue situations that would be too dangerous for others to handle. The AKS holds responsibility for all anti-terror and counter-terrorism missions in Denmark. It is known that AKS cross-trains with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Danish%20Army\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Danish%20Navy\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; elite-units &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A6gerkorpset\"&gt;J\u00e6gerkorpset&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Danish%20Frogman%20Corps\"&gt;Fr\u00f8mandskorpset&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir training includes: tactical shooting, hand-to-hand combat, surveillance, and explosives. Policemen who want to join the unit are required to take and pass selection tests.\nHistory.\nThe unit's operational functions are closely guarded secrets, so not much is known. What has been published is that the unit was created just after the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20massacre\"&gt;Munich Summer Olympic incident&lt;/a&gt; in 1972.\nIn 1998 the unit was re-organized to include a permanent force of roughly 100 police officers; it previously \"borrowed\" officers from regular units on an \"as needed\" basis.\nAKS led the operation of clearing and evicting the &lt;a href=\"anarchist\"&gt;anarchist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"leftist\"&gt;leftist&lt;/a&gt; groups from &lt;a href=\"Ungdomshuset\"&gt;Ungdomshuset&lt;/a&gt; on March 1, 2007.\nIts activities are under the jurisdiction of the &lt;a href=\"Danish%20Security%20and%20Intelligence%20Service\"&gt;Danish Security and Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt; (PET).\nAn officer from AKS was seriously wounded on January 7, 2013, during an arrest operation against three suspected narcotics smugglers. The suspected perpetrator was killed by a headshot and another man was wounded. A third man was arrested. It was the first time that an AKS-officer had been wounded during an operation."
