This ninth volume flashes back to those marvelous stories and the unbridled antics therein, which, unfortunately for Ralph, shaved off eight of his lives.\" Eight Rotten Ralph books had then been published by Houghton Mifflin, all picture books; \"Nine Lives\" was the ninth. Four \"rotten readers\" had been published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux."
