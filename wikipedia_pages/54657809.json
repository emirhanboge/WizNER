    "text": "Skydiver day is an unofficial holiday of &lt;a href=\"skydiver\"&gt;skydiver&lt;/a&gt;s, annually celebrated on 26 July in some countries, such as &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belarus\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, skydiver day is celebrated on 22 October.\nHistory.\nIn 1929, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;RA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kombrig\"&gt;kombrig&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Minov\"&gt;Leonid Minov&lt;/a&gt; within the trading organization &lt;a href=\"Amtorg%20Trading%20Corporation\"&gt;Amtorg Trading Corporation&lt;/a&gt; had visited the &lt;a href=\"IRVIN-GQ\"&gt;IRVIN-GQ&lt;/a&gt; factory, which produced the emergency &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt;s, and performed several jumps. After returning to the &lt;a href=\"USSR\"&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt; he was appointed to the Skydiving instructor position of the &lt;a href=\"air%20force\"&gt;air force&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;RA&lt;/a&gt;. He had performed a theoretical preparation for 30 volunteers of the 11th aviation crew of Moscow military district.\nOn 26 July, near Voronizh five &lt;a href=\"USSR\"&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt; pilots and mechanics (Moshkovsky, Yegorov, Zakharov, Kovalenkov, Kukharenko, Mukhin, Povalyaev, Poydus, Fillipov, Freidman, Cherkashyn), headed by &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Minov\"&gt;Leonid Minov&lt;/a&gt;, had performed the first training series of jumps from the &lt;a href=\"Airplane\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; in the history of the &lt;a href=\"USSR\"&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt;s used for jumps were produced by American company &lt;a href=\"IRVIN-GQ\"&gt;IRVIN-GQ&lt;/a&gt;, and were bought by &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Minov\"&gt;Leonid Minov&lt;/a&gt; during his visit to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. In total, there were 59 jumps performed during the trainings from the period from 26 to 29 July. The first experience in 1930 propelled the further development of &lt;a href=\"skydiving\"&gt;skydiving&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"USSR\"&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt;. There were around 600 jumps performed from 1930 till the end of 1931. The enthusiasm was so high that many &lt;a href=\"skydiving%20towers\"&gt;skydiving towers&lt;/a&gt; were built in city parks so anyone could perform jumps there."
