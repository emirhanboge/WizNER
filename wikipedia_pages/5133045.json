    "text": "The Aguaruna (or Awaj\u00fan, their &lt;a href=\"endonym\"&gt;endonym&lt;/a&gt;) are an &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;indigenous people&lt;/a&gt; of the Peruvian jungle. They live primarily on the &lt;a href=\"Mara%C3%B1%C3%B3n%20River%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; near the border with &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; and several of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n's tributaries, the rivers &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20River%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nieva%20River\"&gt;Nieva&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cenepa%20River\"&gt;Cenepa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Numpatakay%20River\"&gt;Numpatakay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chiriaco%20River\"&gt;Chiriaco&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, they possess titled community lands in four of Peru's regions: Amazonas, Cajamarca, &lt;a href=\"Loreto%20Region\"&gt;Loreto&lt;/a&gt;, and San Mart\u00edn. A significant Awaj\u00fan population also lives in the Alto Mayo river basin in the Department of San Mart\u00edn. According to Peru's 1993 Census the Aguaruna numbered approximately 5,000. World Census data for 2000 lists their population at just over 8,000.\nThe Awaj\u00fan resisted efforts to incorporate them into the Inca and Spanish empires. Their reputation for fierceness and the difficult terrain in which they live prevented them from being incorporated into Peruvian national society until the late 1950s\u2014and later still in some parts of their territory.\nCustoms.\nLiving arrangements.\nAwaj\u00fan families, either &lt;a href=\"Monogamy\"&gt;monogamous&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Polygamy\"&gt;polygamous&lt;/a&gt;, traditionally lived in dispersed neighborhoods of kin related through descent and marriage. Road construction and the establishment of bilingual schools and health posts has led to a more &lt;a href=\"nucleated%20village\"&gt;clustered settlement&lt;/a&gt; pattern and in some cases the appearance of densely populated hamlets.\nExamples of Awaj\u00fan towns include &lt;a href=\"Yutupiza%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;Yutupiza&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20River%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;Santiago River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Japaime%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;Japaime&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Nieva%20River\"&gt;Nieva&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe towns for which there exists a pattern of nucleate population are called \"y\u00e1akat\" in their native language, and do not have streets, footpaths, or squares, but rather are constituted of houses of traditional construction. These houses are distributed in a kind of asymmetric form and the tendency is usually to place them in a linear form along the river.\nAmong the Awaj\u00fan there is a traditional institution of mutual aid known in their language as \"ip\u00e1amamu\", which can be seen in action primarily when they are constructing housing for young couples, clearing fields and, with less frequency, sowing &lt;a href=\"cassava\"&gt;yuca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"peanut\"&gt;peanut&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Awaj\u00fan were traditionally a seminomadic population, relocating on a regular basis as soil fertility and wild game populations declined in the immediate vicinity of their houses. Such relocations have become rarer as Awaj\u00fan find their range of movement increasingly confined to titled community lands, which in some cases are now surrounded by the farms and villages of non-indigenous colonists.\nHunting, gathering and agriculture.\nMajor species of animals that are hunted by the Aguaruna include the &lt;a href=\"white-lipped%20peccary\"&gt;\"sajino\"&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"white-lipped%20peccary\"&gt;\"huangana\"&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20tapir\"&gt;Brazilian tapir&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20tapir\"&gt;\"sachavaca\"&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"little%20red%20brocket\"&gt;little red brocket&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"jaguar\"&gt;\"otorongo\"&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"jaguar\"&gt;jaguar&lt;/a&gt;). Species which are less commonly hunted include the &lt;a href=\"paca\"&gt;\"majaz\"&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"capybara\"&gt;\"ronsoco\"&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"coati\"&gt;\"achuni\"&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"black%20agouti\"&gt;\"a\u00f1uje\"&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nine-banded%20armadillo\"&gt;\"carachupa\"&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"giant%20otter\"&gt;otter&lt;/a&gt;, diverse classes of &lt;a href=\"monkey\"&gt;monkey&lt;/a&gt;s and birds.\nThe animals that they hunt not only provide &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;; the skin, &lt;a href=\"feather\"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tooth\"&gt;teeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s are also used. Hunting therefore has a double purpose: for dietary needs and also for making handicrafts, medicines and items used in &lt;a href=\"witchcraft\"&gt;witchcraft&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally, the tribe hunted with a &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; perfected with \"&lt;a href=\"Bactris%20gasipaes\"&gt;pijuayo&lt;/a&gt;\" (a palm tree of very hard wood) and the &lt;a href=\"Blowgun\"&gt;blowpipe&lt;/a&gt;. At present the &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; has been almost completely displaced by the pellet &lt;a href=\"shotgun\"&gt;shotgun&lt;/a&gt; but they also continue using the &lt;a href=\"Blowgun\"&gt;blowpipe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey gather the wild fruit of some &lt;a href=\"Arecaceae\"&gt;palm tree&lt;/a&gt;s, like the &lt;a href=\"Pouruma%20cecropiifolia\"&gt;uvilla&lt;/a&gt; some &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"bud\"&gt;bud&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"palm%20tree\"&gt;palm tree&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"Plant%20stem\"&gt;stem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Bark%20%28botany%29\"&gt;bark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"resin\"&gt;resin&lt;/a&gt;s. They extract &lt;a href=\"leche%20caspi%20%28Couma%20macrocarpa%29\"&gt;\"leche caspi\"&lt;/a&gt; and gather the &lt;a href=\"honey\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; of wild &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s, edible &lt;a href=\"worm\"&gt;worm&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Rhynchophorus%20palmarum\"&gt;suri&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"beetle\"&gt;beetle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;medicinal plants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"liana\"&gt;liana&lt;/a&gt;s. They use everything that they gather either for food, &lt;a href=\"crafts\"&gt;crafts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"traditional%20medicine\"&gt;traditional medicine&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"witchcraft\"&gt;witchcraft&lt;/a&gt; or as &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt;, adhering to an ancestral pattern of self-sufficiency. The Awaj\u00fan are known among naturalists for their sophisticated knowledge of rainforest flora and fauna, which has been the focus of extensive studies by ethnobotanists and ethnozoologists.\nAs agricultural instruments, they use the traditional \"&lt;a href=\"w%C3%A1i\"&gt;w\u00e1i&lt;/a&gt;\" (a stick with a sharp end, made from the wood of the \"&lt;a href=\"Bactris%20gasipaes\"&gt;pijuayo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"palm%20tree\"&gt;palm tree&lt;/a&gt;\"), along with the &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"machete\"&gt;machete&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther activities.\nThe principal &lt;a href=\"crafts\"&gt;crafts&lt;/a&gt; are masculine activities like &lt;a href=\"rope\"&gt;rope&lt;/a&gt;making, &lt;a href=\"Basket%20weaving\"&gt;basketry&lt;/a&gt;, the construction of &lt;a href=\"canoe\"&gt;canoe&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"textile\"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt;s; and feminine activities like &lt;a href=\"Pottery\"&gt;ceramics&lt;/a&gt; and making &lt;a href=\"necklace\"&gt;necklace&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s' small &lt;a href=\"wing\"&gt;wing&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bead\"&gt;bead&lt;/a&gt;s. The men make headdresses of exquisite &lt;a href=\"feather\"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt;s as well as &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ribbon\"&gt;ribbon&lt;/a&gt;s on the ends of which they place &lt;a href=\"feather\"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt;s and human hair. These adornments are kept in &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; cases.\nHistory.\nThe real origin of the Aguaruna people is still a mystery. In accordance with the racial characteristics of the majority, some anthropologists suppose that they came down the &lt;a href=\"Andes\"&gt;Andes&lt;/a&gt; centuries ago and adapted themselves to the geographical conditions of the region. Others believe that they are emigrants of &lt;a href=\"Central%20America\"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt; who came either by the coast or through rivers. They established themselves in a zone much wider than the one they occupy now. Apparently this zone also included the present-day &lt;a href=\"Ja%C3%A9n%2C%20Peru\"&gt;Ja\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;. It is also said that they were influenced by cultural groups that were immigrants from the islands of &lt;a href=\"Melanesia\"&gt;Melanesia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey have always had the reputation of being brave warriors, standing out for their skills in war. Physically there are differences between the Aguarunas and the other inhabitants of the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20rainforest\"&gt;Peruvian rainforest&lt;/a&gt;. Their average height is taller \u2013 especially the men's \u2013 and their physical constitution denotes strength.\nThe Aguarunas have a traditional, ideological and material culture, and they communicate with each other in their own language. A dictionary of this language, \"&lt;a href=\"Vocabulario%20aguaruna%20del%20Amazonas\"&gt;Vocabulario aguaruna del Amazonas&lt;/a&gt;\" (Aguaruna Vocabulary of Amazonas) was compiled by &lt;a href=\"Mildred%20Larson\"&gt;Mildred L. Larson&lt;/a&gt; and published by &lt;a href=\"SIL%20International\"&gt;SIL International&lt;/a&gt; in 1966. The Aguarunas are located in the geographical area of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n river, that is to say on the banks of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n river and of its tributaries, the rivers &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20river%20%28Ecuador%29\"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nieva%20River\"&gt;Nieva&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cenepa%20River\"&gt;Cenepa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Numpatakay%20River\"&gt;Numpatakay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chiriaco%20River\"&gt;Chiriaco&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike many other cultural groups in what is now Peru, the Aguaruna were never successfully conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Inca%20Empire\"&gt;Inca&lt;/a&gt;, although there are accounts of attempts to extend into the territory by Incas &lt;a href=\"Huayna%20Capac\"&gt;Huayna Capac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tupac%20Inca%20Yupanqui\"&gt;Tupac Inca Yupanqui&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"conquistadors\"&gt;conquistadors&lt;/a&gt; first encountered the Aguaruna in 1549 when the towns of &lt;a href=\"Ja%C3%A9n%20de%20Bracamoros\"&gt;Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20de%20Nieva\"&gt;Santa Maria de Nieva&lt;/a&gt; were founded. Fifty years later, a rebellion among the indigenous people forced the Spaniards out of the area. An agricultural colony was later established at &lt;a href=\"Borja%2C%20Peru\"&gt;Borja&lt;/a&gt; in 1865. Attempts by &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Order\"&gt;Dominican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jesuit\"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt; missionaries to convert the Aguarunas were largely unsuccessful.\nTraditionally, the economy of the Aguaruna was based mostly on hunting, fishing and subsistence agriculture. However, over the last few decades they have increasingly become engaged in capitalism. Some communities now cultivate rice, coffee, cocoa and bananas for sale, either in local markets or for transport to coastal cities like &lt;a href=\"Chiclayo\"&gt;Chiclayo&lt;/a&gt;. Maintenance of the transandean oil pipeline and the medicinal plant industry also play roles in the local economy.\nReligion.\nThe Aguarunas traditionally believed in many spirits and mythological figures, among them: \"&lt;a href=\"Zeus%20%28god%29\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;\", or the Sun; \"&lt;a href=\"N%C3%BAgkui\"&gt;N\u00fagkui&lt;/a&gt;\", or Mother Earth, Pachamama who ensures agricultural success and provides the clay for ceramics; \"&lt;a href=\"Ts%C3%BAgki\"&gt;Ts\u00fagki&lt;/a&gt;\", water spirits who live in the rivers; and \"&lt;a href=\"Bikut\"&gt;Bikut&lt;/a&gt;\", or father shaman, who transforms himself into hallucinogenic plants that, mixed with &lt;a href=\"ayahuasca\"&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/a&gt;, drugs allows one to communicate with powerful spirit but killed half population-beings.\nYoung men would traditionally take hallucinogenic plants including &lt;a href=\"ayahuasca\"&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/a&gt; to give them visions. The visions were believed to be the souls of dead warriors, and if the young man showed no fear he would receive spirit power known as \"aj\u00fatap\". A man with such spirit power would be invulnerable in battle.\nIn the distant past, the Aguarunas engaged in the practice of shrinking human heads to make \"&lt;a href=\"tsantsa\"&gt;tsantsa&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEvangelical missionaries began contacting the Aguaruna in the mid-20th century, and today many Aguarunas have converted to Christianity.\nBiopiracy controversy.\nIn the later half of the 20th century, the arrival of Protestant and Jesuit missionaries, the building of roads, and the construction of an oil pipeline created substantial tension between the Aguaruna people, poor agricultural colonists, state agencies, and corporations. In response to new threats to their way of life the Aguaruna began to organize a political and social response to defend themselves on the basis of principles consistent with other &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20rights\"&gt;rights of indigenous peoples&lt;/a&gt;. Aguaruna community organizations include the Organizaci\u00f3n Central de Comunidades Aguarunas del Alto Mara\u00f1on (OCCAAM), founded in 1975, and the Consejo Aguaruna y Huambisa (CAH), an organization founded in 1977 that represents the Aguaruna and a closely related ethnic group, the &lt;a href=\"Huambisa%20people\"&gt;Huambisa&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, Aguaruna community organizers have founded more than 12 local organizations (including an Aguaruna women's federation).\nThe CAH is widely regarded the most influential political entity representing the Aguaruna (and Huambisa) peoples, and played a central role in national level indigenous movements in Peru and in the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Coordinating%20Body%20of%20Indigenous%20Organizations%20of%20the%20Amazon%20Basin\"&gt;Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin&lt;/a&gt; (COICA), which represents Amazonian peoples from all over &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the mid-1990s Aguaruna were involved in negotiating a novel &lt;a href=\"bioprospecting\"&gt;bioprospecting&lt;/a&gt; agreement with a US-based pharmaceutical multinational, G.D. Searle &amp; Company (then part of &lt;a href=\"Monsanto\"&gt;Monsanto&lt;/a&gt;), and a group of ethnobotanists from &lt;a href=\"Washington%20University\"&gt;Washington University&lt;/a&gt;. The project involved a controversy over violations of the Aguarunas' rights over their genetic and cultural resources and to an equitable share in the potential profits derived from pharmaceuticals based on their &lt;a href=\"traditional%20knowledge\"&gt;traditional knowledge&lt;/a&gt; of medicinal plants. The US National Institutes of Health froze funding to the Washington University scientists.\nNegotiations that began between Washington University and CAH on a bioprospecting agreement failed when Washington University's Walter Lewis collected Aguaruna medicinal plants and knowledge without a benefit-sharing agreement in place, leading to claims of &lt;a href=\"biopiracy\"&gt;biopiracy&lt;/a&gt;. The CAH terminated its relationship with Walter Lewis, Washington University, and their US government sponsors.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Cahill%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Tim Cahill&lt;/a&gt; wrote in his \"&lt;a href=\"Outside%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Outside&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine account of a father's search for closure, \"A Darkness on the River\", \"On the evening of January 18, 1995\", just before the outbreak of the border war with neighboring Ecuador, \"two 26-year-old Americans, Josh Silver and Patchen Miller, floated down the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n on a large balsa-wood raft they had built several days earlier. They tied off in the eddy at the downriver tail of the island. About 9:30 that night, they were shot and left for dead. Josh Silver survived and was treated for his wounds at an army base and then transferred to a hospital in Santa Mar\u00eda de Nieva. The American consul general in Peru, Thomas Holladay, was informed that two Americans had been attacked. One was alive; the other was missing and feared dead.\" Patchen's body was never recovered nor the crime solved. The attackers were drunk Aguarunas, probably from the nearby village of Huaracayo. There has been speculation that the two Americans were mistaken by the Aguaruna for Washington University specimen hunters. It is also possible the Peruvian Army suspected them of espionage on the eve of the outbreak of war with Ecuador in the nearby border area. Despite Embassy attempts to elicit strong action, the Peruvian government showed no serious effort to investigate the killing, leaving the investigation to the poorly equipped local police outpost at Nieva. The Army conducted its own investigation immediately after Josh Silver showed up on the jetty of the army outpost at Urakuza but has not shared its findings with civilian authorities.\nAfter that, Washington University entered into negotiations with OCCAAM as well as their national representative organization the Confederaci\u00f3n de Nacionalidades Amaz\u00f3nicas del Per\u00fa (CONAP). One of the first demands of these organisations was that all material and knowledge previously collected by Washington University be returned. They also demanded that a traditional meeting in the form of an IPAAMAMU be held on Aguaruna territory. At the IPAAMAMU attended by over eighty representatives of sixty Aguaruna communities participants approved continuing negotiations and called upon CONAP, its legal adviser and a representative of the Peruvian Environmental Law Society (SPDA) to provide them with advice and support in the negotiations.\nThe SPDA legal advisor, the Irish lawyer Brendan Tobin, had repeatedly offered his legal services to the Consejo Aguaruna Huambisa (CAH), but they have refused. In significant measure, this was due to SPDA's tight relationship with the government of then Peruvian President &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Fujimori\"&gt;Alberto Fujimori&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe negotiations with OCCAAM and the other participating organizations led a group of agreements, including a \"know-how license,\" which was entered into by the participating Agaurauna organizations, CONAP, and Monsanto's pharmaceutical arm Searle and Company. The licensing arrangement was designed to give the Aguarunas greater control over the use of their knowledge once it left their direct control.\nThe \"know-how license\" concept as applied to indigenous peoples' knowledge is a legal first, according to Professor Charles McManis of Washington University School of Law. Professor McManis worked for the same university profiting from the arrangement and, in any event, the license earned nobody any money or fame except the SPDA advisor. For the Aguaruna, it earned them nothing."
