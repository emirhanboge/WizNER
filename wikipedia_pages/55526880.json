The format of the competition is similar to last season with Scottish clubs not competing. For the third consecutive season the four Welsh teams are the reserve sides of the teams competing in the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Pro14\"&gt;Pro14&lt;/a&gt; competition instead of clubs from the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;Welsh Premier Division&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format is a pool stage followed by a knockout stage. The pool stage consists of five pools of four teams playing home and away matches. The top side in each pool, plus the three best runners-up, progress to the knockout stage. The eight quarter-finalists are ranked, with top four teams having home advantage. The four winning quarter-finalists progress to the semi-final draw. Most of the matches are played on the same weekends as the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20European%20Rugby%20Champions%20Cup\"&gt;European Champions Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20European%20Rugby%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;European Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt;. First round matches begin on 13 October 2017 and the final will be held in April 2018.\nParticipating teams and locations.\nThe allocation of teams is as follows:\nPool stages.\n(Q) denotes the team has qualified for the quarter-finals as the pool winners\n(q) denotes team has at least qualified for the quarter-finals as one of the three highest-scoring second-place teams\nKnock-out stage.\nThe eight qualifiers are seeded according to performance in the pool stage. The four top seeds hosted the quarter-finals against the lower seeds, in a 1 v 8, 2 v 7, 3 v 6 and 4 v 5 format. However, if two teams qualify from the same group they can not be drawn together. Therefore Leinster A cannot be drawn against Doncaster Knights. \nTeams are ranked by:"
