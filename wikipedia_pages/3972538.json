    "text": "Harty is a small hamlet on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Sheppey\"&gt;Isle of Sheppey&lt;/a&gt; in Kent consisting of a few cottages, a church and a public house, the Ferry Inn (a ). It is part of the &lt;a href=\"civil%20parish\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Leysdown\"&gt;Leysdown&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe earliest recorded evidence of human occupation comes from a late &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Age\"&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hoard\"&gt;hoard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Chisel%23Gouge\"&gt;gouged&lt;/a&gt; bronze founder's appliances and metal. The find has wider importance from the information it gives into methods used for casting in the late Bronze Age. Evidence of Roman occupation also exists; finds of &lt;a href=\"tesserae\"&gt;tesserae&lt;/a&gt;, roof and flue tiles may indicate the site of a Roman villa.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; there were extensive salt workings. Remains today consist of groups of \"salt mounds\" which are the waste left over from the process. Park Farmhouse is a dating from the 16 century.\nIn 1798 &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Hasted\"&gt;Edward Hasted&lt;/a&gt; recorded that an earlier form of the name was 'Harteigh' which he presumes came from the Saxon Heord-tu, an island \"filled with herds of cattle\". Other forms of the name have been Hertei (1086), Heartege (1100), Herteye (1242) and the modern Harty by 1610. Hasted also noted that the islet was part of the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20%28county%20division%29\"&gt;hundred&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Faversham\"&gt;Faversham&lt;/a&gt; unlike the rest of the island of Sheppey which came within Milton Hundred. There were also 4000 sheep and six cottages with 20 people, but of those 20 six were on permanent poor relief and another 3 occasionally so.\nHarty is a few minutes walk from the Swale National Nature Reserve. Public footpaths run from Harty, along the southern extent of the reserve to the hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Shellness\"&gt;Shellness&lt;/a&gt;, and back around the reserve's northern perimeter to Harty.\nChurch of St Thomas the Apostle.\nThe church of 'St Thomas the Apostle' is a The date of founding cannot be fixed with certainty. The official listing dates it to late 11th or early 12th century, based in part on and in part on &lt;a href=\"%23\"&gt;Patience &amp; Perks&lt;/a&gt;. Patience &amp; Perks start by reporting the raid by Harold in 1052 and then note that \"\"The date ascribed to the church of 1089 would be consistent with a re-building following damage by the Danes\". However, on the next page they discuss the narrow walls which are indicative of Saxon builders and note that in 1989, when a shallow trench was excavated in the south wall, traces of Saxon work were found. &lt;a href=\"Tufa\"&gt;Tufa&lt;/a&gt; stone was rarely used after the early Norman period, and so the use of it in a window in the north wall would indicate a date of no later than the end of the 11th century. Patience &amp; Perks observe that the \"date of AD 1089 is ascribed to the Norman work, which may well have been the re-building of an earlier structure desecrated by the Danish invaders\".\nAfter 1200 the north &lt;a href=\"Aisle%23Church%20architecture\"&gt;aisle&lt;/a&gt; was built and the original north wall pierced to form the existing &lt;a href=\"Arcade%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt;. The now blocked off south door was cut at about this time. In the head of the jamb is a &lt;a href=\"Canonical%20sundial%23Other%20names\"&gt;scratch dial&lt;/a&gt; or primitive sundial. A little later the chancel was rebuilt, extended to create the sanctuary and the porch to the north door constructed. At what point the Norman chancel arch was removed is unclear, possibly at the time of the rebuilding but certainly prior to the erection of the &lt;a href=\"rood%20screen\"&gt;rood screen&lt;/a&gt;. The 14th century saw the construction of the vestry, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20chapel\"&gt;Lady chapel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"buttress\"&gt;buttress&lt;/a&gt;ing of the south and west walls. The existing rood screen probably dates to this period. There is no rood loft but the stairs leading to one are still visible. The stairs lead out of what is now the vestry but was originally the north chapel. This was a 14th-century extension of the north aisle eastwards. Within the vestry is the remains of an &lt;a href=\"aumbry\"&gt;aumbry&lt;/a&gt; or secure cupboard for holding books and valuable plate. The 19th and 20th centuries have also left their marks. The former saw heavy restoration including a complete reroofing of the nave (including reraftering) and heavy pointing of the exterior. The later has seen necessary restoration to the west end which was damaged by a bomb during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo the north of the &lt;a href=\"high%20altar\"&gt;high altar&lt;/a&gt; there is a &lt;a href=\"Niche%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;niche&lt;/a&gt; which may have held a figure of St Thomas. Traces of a 14C painting therein have been obscured by a 15C one. There is also a niche for a figure in the Lady chapel, recently (c.1999) filled by a statue of &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%20of%20Walsingham\"&gt;Our Lady of Walsingham&lt;/a&gt;. Against the western wall of the lady chapel is a 14th-century oak &lt;a href=\"muniment\"&gt;muniment&lt;/a&gt; chest, the front of which is carved with a representation of a joust. In 1987 it was stolen and recovered from &lt;a href=\"Phillips%20%28auctioneers%29\"&gt;Phillips auction rooms&lt;/a&gt;. To protect it, the lady chapel arch is filled with an iron screen. It was during the installation of this screen that the shallow trench referred to above was dug.\nThe church is unusual that there is no electricity or running water. Lighting in the nave is provided by hanging paraffin lamps and by wall mounted lamps with reflectors. The parish is within the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Diocese of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; and deanery of &lt;a href=\"Sittingbourne\"&gt;Sittingbourne&lt;/a&gt;. There is one bell hung for swing chiming of approximately .\nFerries and bridge.\nHasted also records the existence of the ferry across &lt;a href=\"The%20Swale\"&gt;The Swale&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Oare%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Oare&lt;/a&gt; on the mainland. The old ferry is reflected in the name of the adjacent Inn. The rights to the ferry were, and still are, held by the landlord of the \"Ferry House\" Inn. The southern, mainland, terminus was close to the villages of Oare and Uplees. Today the remains of the southern jetty are on the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Oare%20Marshes\"&gt;Oare Marshes&lt;/a&gt; nature reserve. A small cluster of buildings close by still bear the name Harty Ferry Cottages. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Engineers\"&gt;Royal Engineers&lt;/a&gt; built a bridge across the Swale. The last ferry boat fell to pieces around 1941 and has never been replaced, although the official list entry for the church mentions the ferry as being in use until 1946. An attempt to start a small hovercraft service between the Harty Ferry Inn and Oare Creek in 1970 by the then landlord, Ben Fowler, failed after a few days.\n records:\nThe \"violent inundation\" appears to have occurred in 1293. The silting of the fleet rendering Harty a &lt;a href=\"tidal%20island\"&gt;tidal island&lt;/a&gt; was complete by the time Hastead was writing in 1798. A hundred years later (in 1893) during floods the fleet grew to be wide but today is cut off from Windmill Creek by a causeway."
