    "text": "The Marj Mitchell Sportsmanship Award is the sportsmanship award at the annual &lt;a href=\"Scotties%20Tournament%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Scotties Tournament of Hearts&lt;/a&gt;, held to crown the Canadian women's &lt;a href=\"curling\"&gt;curling&lt;/a&gt; championship. When &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Paper%20Company\"&gt;Scott Paper&lt;/a&gt; took over sponsorship of the Canadian Women's Curling Championship in 1982, they decided to present an annual award for sportsmanship. From 1982 to 1997, the award had a different name each year, as the convention was to name the annual award after an individual from the host region who exemplified sportsmanship and dedication to curling. In 1998, the decision was made to honour &lt;a href=\"Marj%20Mitchell\"&gt;Marj Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; each year. Mitchell curled for &lt;a href=\"Saskatchewan\"&gt;Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt; and captured the national and &lt;a href=\"World%20Curling%20Championships\"&gt;world championships&lt;/a&gt; in 1982.
