    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"electrochemistry\"&gt;electrochemistry&lt;/a&gt;, polarization is a collective term for certain mechanical side-effects (of an electrochemical process) by which isolating barriers develop at the interface between &lt;a href=\"electrode\"&gt;electrode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"electrolyte\"&gt;electrolyte&lt;/a&gt;. These side-effects influence the &lt;a href=\"redox\"&gt;reaction mechanism&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the &lt;a href=\"chemical%20kinetics\"&gt;chemical kinetics&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"corrosion\"&gt;corrosion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deposition%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;metal deposition&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a reaction we can displace the bonding electrons by attacking reagents. The electronic displacement in turn may be due to certain effects, some of which are permanent (inductive and mesomeric effects), and the others are temporary (electromeric effect). Those effects which are permanently operating in the molecule are known as polarization effects, and those effects which are brought into play by attacking reagent (and as the attacking reagent is removed, the electronic displacement disappears) are known as polarisability effects.\nThe term 'polarization' derives from the early 19th-century discovery that &lt;a href=\"electrolysis\"&gt;electrolysis&lt;/a&gt; causes the elements in an electrolyte to be attracted towards one or the other &lt;a href=\"electric%20dipole\"&gt;pole&lt;/a&gt; i.e. the gasses were \"&lt;a href=\"Chemical%20polarity\"&gt;polarized&lt;/a&gt;\" towards the electrodes. Thus, initially 'polarization' was essentially a description of electrolysis itself, and in the context of &lt;a href=\"electrochemical%20cells\"&gt;electrochemical cells&lt;/a&gt; used to describe the effects on the electrolyte (which was then called \"polarization liquid\"). In time, as more electrochemical processes were invented, the term 'polarization' evolved to denote any (potentially undesirable) mechanical side-effects that occur at the interface between electrolyte and electrodes.\nThese mechanical side-effects are:\nBoth effects isolate the electrode from the electrolyte, impeding reaction and charge transfer between the two. The immediate consequences of these barriers are:\nEach of these immediate consequences has multiple secondary effects. For instance, heat affects the crystalline structure of the electrode material. This in turn can influence reaction rate, and/or accelerate &lt;a href=\"Dendrite%20%28metal%29\"&gt;dendrite&lt;/a&gt; formation, and/or deform the plates, and/or precipitate &lt;a href=\"thermal%20runaway\"&gt;thermal runaway&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mechanical side-effects can be desirable in some electrochemical processes, for example, certain types of &lt;a href=\"electropolishing\"&gt;electropolishing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"electroplating\"&gt;electroplating&lt;/a&gt; take advantage of the fact that evolved gasses will first accumulate in the depressions of the plate. This feature can be used to reduce current in the depressions, and exposes ridges and edges to higher currents. Undesirable polarization can be suppressed by vigorous agitation of the electrolyte, or when agitation is impractical (such as in a stationary battery) with a &lt;a href=\"depolarizer\"&gt;depolarizer&lt;/a&gt;."
