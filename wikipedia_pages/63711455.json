    "text": "Celypha woodiana also known as the mistletoe marble is a &lt;a href=\"moth\"&gt;moth&lt;/a&gt; of the family &lt;a href=\"Tortricidae\"&gt;Tortricidae&lt;/a&gt; found in Europe. In &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; the moth is a priority species in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Biodiversity%20Action%20Plan\"&gt;United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nWingspan c. 17mm. The moths fly in July and August and can be found resting on tree trunks during the day. They also come to &lt;a href=\"Moth%20trap\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;.\nEggs can be found on mistletoe (\"&lt;a href=\"Viscum%20album\"&gt;Viscum album&lt;/a&gt;\") in September and October.\nLarvae can be found from September to May in a &lt;a href=\"Leaf%20mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;. The initial mine is inconspicuous as a brown, narrow, lower-surface corridor and the larva can leave the mine and start a new one elsewhere. In April and May the larva make a full depth transparent blotch with most of the &lt;a href=\"frass\"&gt;frass&lt;/a&gt; ejected. The mines can be difficult to find as the leaf falls from the plant.\nLarvae pupate in June, in a loose cocoon amongst &lt;a href=\"lichen\"&gt;lichen&lt;/a&gt;s or under the bark of the host tree.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe moth is found from &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; but is absent in some countries, including the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn England the moth has been found in the following counties; &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire\"&gt;Gloucestershire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herefordshire\"&gt;Herefordshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Somerset\"&gt;Somerset&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warwickshire\"&gt;Warwickshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Worcestershire\"&gt;Worcestershire&lt;/a&gt;. The moth was found in &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in 2019 with leaf mines and a larva at &lt;a href=\"Magor%20Marsh\"&gt;Magor Marsh&lt;/a&gt; (), a &lt;a href=\"Gwent%20Wildlife%20Trust\"&gt;Gwent Wildlife Trust&lt;/a&gt; nature reserve. It is rare and mostly confined to mature &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt; (\"Malus\" spp) &lt;a href=\"orchard\"&gt;orchard&lt;/a&gt;s in southern England and the south &lt;a href=\"Midlands\"&gt;Midlands&lt;/a&gt;. Mistletoe on &lt;a href=\"Crataegus\"&gt;hawthorn&lt;/a&gt; (\"Crataegus\" spp) is the next preferred host tree and it has also been found on pear (\"&lt;a href=\"Pyrus%20communis\"&gt;Pyrus communis&lt;/a&gt;\"), crack willow (\"&lt;a href=\"Salix%20fragilis\"&gt;Salix fragilis&lt;/a&gt;\") and rowan (\"&lt;a href=\"Sorbus%20aucuparia\"&gt;Sorbus aucuparia&lt;/a&gt;\") which has been planted. The moth seems to prefer succulent specimens and is able to survive on isolated clumps of mistletoe.\nConservation.\nIn Great Britain the moth is subject to a &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Biodiversity%20Action%20Plan\"&gt;Biodiversity action plan&lt;/a&gt; (UK BAP species). Traditional orchards which are a UK Biodiversity Action Plan Priority habitat and the preferred habitat of the moth are in decline. Known and potential sites should be protected."
