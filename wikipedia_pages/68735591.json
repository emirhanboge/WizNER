    "title": "2020\u20132021 Xi Jinping Administration reform spree",
    "text": "In 2020, the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Chinese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; (CCP) and various Chinese regulatory bodies, under &lt;a href=\"General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Chinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;CCP General Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xi%20Jinping\"&gt;Xi Jinping&lt;/a&gt;, began a regulatory spree, strengthening regulations, issuing fines, and introducing or modifying laws. Though mostly targeted at disrupting the growth of \"monopolistic\" technology companies, the government also introduced other reforms with implications for large swathes of the economy and life in China. Actions taken include the implementation of restrictions on for-profit tutoring and education companies, the refinement of existing rules for &lt;a href=\"Video%20game%20controversies%23Video%20game%20impacts%20on%20youth\"&gt;limits on minors playing online video games&lt;/a&gt;, and the introduction of new antitrust rules.\nBackground and origins.\nHistorical background.\nChina's government is nominally &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20economic%20reform\"&gt;reforms&lt;/a&gt; under Chinese leader &lt;a href=\"Deng%20Xiaoping\"&gt;Deng Xiaoping&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s relaxed government control of some portions of the economy, allowing for the emergence of private industry. China maintains state-controlled companies, such as &lt;a href=\"China%20Mobile\"&gt;China Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, and the economy, referred to as a \"&lt;a href=\"socialist%20market%20economy\"&gt;socialist market economy&lt;/a&gt;\", operates with a high degree of state control when compared to the economies of many &lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; nations.\nRecent events and context.\nRelations between China and the United States became strained during the &lt;a href=\"Trump%20administration\"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; and tensions remain high during the &lt;a href=\"Biden%20administration\"&gt;Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; over disputes such as the sovereignty of Taiwan. An ongoing &lt;a href=\"China%E2%80%93United%20States%20trade%20war\"&gt;trade war&lt;/a&gt; between the two countries has negatively impacted both economies. This has led to speculation that the two countries will consciously \"decouple\" their economies.\nChina has a rapidly aging population. The nation also has a declining birth rate, attributed to the costs associated with raising children.\nReasoning, timing, and goals.\nAs stated by Chinese officials.\nChinese leadership has said the reforms aim to increase \"common prosperity\" in the hopes of shrinking the country's income and wealth disparities. Some of the efforts aim to lower the costs associated with child-rearing in the hopes of reversing a falling birth-rate.\nInterpretations and speculation.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street%20Journal\"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" has stated that the goal of the reforms is to establish tighter control over the market economy, granting the state and the Communist Party renewed legitimacy. Other commentators have speculated that the reforms amount to an attempt by Xi to retrench his power before the &lt;a href=\"20th%20National%20Congress%20of%20the%20Chinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; and an effort aimed at China increasing its self-reliance, due to heightened tensions with trading partners.\nBeginning of reform activity.\n\"Three red lines\" and property sector regulation.\nA &lt;a href=\"working%20paper\"&gt;working paper&lt;/a&gt; published by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Research\"&gt;National Bureau of Economic Research&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 estimated China's property sector accounted for 29% of the country's economic activity. In August 2020, in an effort to better manage the sector, which historically has been heavily leveraged, Chinese regulators introduced drafts of rules dubbed the \"three red lines\" to formally limit the borrowing of real estate firms. The \"three red lines\" mandate that developers maintain\nReuters reported that developers responded to the drafts by intensifying the use of tactics used to disguise debt. By the end of 2020, approximately half of the country's 66 largest developers were in compliance with the new regulations. In April 2021, only two firms\u2014Evergrande and &lt;a href=\"R%26amp%3BF%20Properties\"&gt;R&amp;F Properties&lt;/a&gt;\u2014remained non-compliant with all three red lines.\nSuspension of Ant Group IPO.\n&lt;a href=\"Ant%20Group\"&gt;Ant Group&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese technology-enabled financial company majority-owned by its founder, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Ma\"&gt;Jack Ma&lt;/a&gt;, and affiliated with Ma's other major holding, &lt;a href=\"Alibaba%20Group\"&gt;Alibaba&lt;/a&gt;, began taking steps toward an &lt;a href=\"initial%20public%20offering\"&gt;initial public offering&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. Ant Group operates a number of lines of business, including &lt;a href=\"Alipay\"&gt;Alipay&lt;/a&gt;, an online payments platform, &lt;a href=\"Zhima%20Credit\"&gt;Zhima Credit&lt;/a&gt;, a credit scoring program, and &lt;a href=\"Yu%27e%20Bao\"&gt;Yu'e Bao&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"money%20market%20fund\"&gt;money market fund&lt;/a&gt;. Ant Group intended to raise $34 billion through the IPO process. This would have been the largest such offering by any company to date, above the $29.4 billion raised by &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Aramco\"&gt;Saudi Aramco&lt;/a&gt; as a result of its 2019 offering.\nDue to Ant Group's scale\u2014the company has approximately one billion users in China\u2014and its operations, which include lending services, the company has attracted regulatory scrutiny in the past. The &lt;a href=\"China%20Securities%20Regulatory%20Commission\"&gt;China Securities Regulatory Commission&lt;/a&gt; previously imposed new restrictions on money-market funds, a move attributed to the size and growth of &lt;a href=\"Yu%27e%20Bao\"&gt;Yu'e Bao&lt;/a&gt;, an Ant offering. Though the company asserts it does not function as a bank or a financial institution, Chinese banks have voiced their belief that Ant draws deposits away from them, so undermining the banking system. The People's Bank of China requested data from banks that lent through Ant in mid-2020 and the &lt;a href=\"State%20Administration%20for%20Market%20Regulation\"&gt;State Administration for Market Regulation&lt;/a&gt; informally began an investigation earlier in the year into whether Alipay and &lt;a href=\"WeChat%20Pay\"&gt;WeChat Pay&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tencent\"&gt;Tencent&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary, had abused their size to hamper competitors.\nSeveral days before the IPO was to take place, the company's founder and controlling shareholder, Ma, made negative statements about Chinese regulators and the governing political party, the Chinese Communist Party. Ma criticized regulators for their focus on risk mitigation. Soon after the comments were made, Ma and other senior Ant executives were summoned to a meeting with the &lt;a href=\"China%20Securities%20Regulatory%20Commission\"&gt;China Securities Regulatory Commission&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"China%20Banking%20and%20Insurance%20Regulatory%20Commission\"&gt;China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"State%20Administration%20of%20Foreign%20Exchange\"&gt;State Administration of Foreign Exchange&lt;/a&gt; as well as representatives from the country's central bank, the &lt;a href=\"People%E2%80%99s%20Bank%20of%20China\"&gt;People\u2019s Bank of China&lt;/a&gt;. Ant Group issued a statement disclosing that the Ant and government representatives discussed \"Views regarding the health and stability of the financial sector\".\nAfter the meeting, and two days before the IPO was set to occur, the offering was suspended by the Shanghai Stock Exchange; the Shanghai Stock Exchange referenced \"major issues\" as the reasoning behind the suspension. The exchange further indicated that the company no longer conformed with listing requirements. Ant subsequently suspended the Hong Kong listing. The \"&lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street%20Journal\"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" attributed the suspension to the personal will of Xi, who had become infuriated by Ma's comments, citing \"Chinese officials with knowledge of the matter\", though these assertions have also been characterized as \"rumors\". The suspension was unexpected, surprising bankers working on the transaction, the broader financial industry, and consumers prepared to invest in the offering. It has been referred to as \"abrupt\" and \"shocking\". Ant began working to address regulator concerns in January 2021, though as of September 2021 no public plans for an IPO by the company have been announced.\nJack Ma retreated from the public eye after the IPO's suspension. Some speculated that Ma had left China altogether. He did not appear in public between October 2020 and January 2021. In January 2021, he spoke in a live-streamed video. In the video, he discussed his commitment to philanthropy and improving quality of life for those in rural China.\n\"Disorderly Capital\" and anti-monopoly stance.\nSoon after the suspension of Ant's IPO, in November 2020, Chinese regulators introduced drafts of new anti-monopoly guidelines directed at large technology firms. China had, in January 2020, revised its &lt;a href=\"Anti%20Monopoly%20Law%20of%20China\"&gt;Anti Monopoly Law&lt;/a&gt; to include language applicable to internet and technology companies. In December, Alibaba and a subsidiary of Tencent were both fined for not seeking approval of deals the companies had completed, which was framed as an anti-monopoly action. The anti-monopoly rules introduced in November were formalized as guidelines for companies in February 2021 by the &lt;a href=\"State%20Administration%20for%20Market%20Regulation\"&gt;State Administration for Market Regulation&lt;/a&gt;. These newly instituted rules include banning online retailers from presenting different prices to different consumers based on data collected about them.\nA month after the release of the draft anti-monopoly rules, party officials began using the phrase the \"disorderly expansion of capital\" to describe the target of economic policy and reforms. Disorderly has also been translated as \"irrational\". This \"expansion\" has been construed as responsible for the monopolistic tendencies of technology companies, expensive tutoring for children, and other issues in China.\nAcceleration of reform.\nComments by Xi and SAMR expansion.\nXi Jinping called for further regulation of tech companies and \"&lt;a href=\"Platform%20economy\"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt;\" companies in March 2021. Major platform companies in China include Alibaba and Tencent. Xi further called for existing financial regulations to apply to all financial transactions. The nation's anti-trust authority, the State Administration for Market Regulation, began hiring new staff the month after Xi made these comments. &lt;a href=\"Reuters\"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reported the regulatory body aimed to add some between 20 and 30 staff, adding to their then-current headcount of 40. Reuters also reported that SAMR would have a larger budget and would be granted other resources.\nIn April 2021, the same month Reuters reported on SAMR's growth, Alibaba was fined $2.8 billion. The fine was issued in response to Alibaba's practice of compelling third-party merchants using its site to choose between listing their offerings on Alibaba and the company's rivals, rather than on both. Financial and legal commentators interpreted this fine as the end of action against Alibaba.\nBan of cryptocurrencies.\nChina's Vice Premier &lt;a href=\"Liu%20He%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Liu He&lt;/a&gt; announced that China would take steps against the mining and trading of &lt;a href=\"bitcoin\"&gt;bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; in May 2021 without providing other information. The announcement caused the price of the digital asset to decline. China had previously become popular with bitcoin miners due to cheap electricity prices; the hikes in the usage of coal power associated with mining clash with China's climate-related goals. The popularity of mining in China may have lead to increases in the illegal extraction of coal. Though many miners have shuttered or moved their operations, Chinese authorities have continued to search for illegal operators continuing to work disguised as other businesses.\nIn September 2021 the People\u2019s Bank of China banned all cryptocurrency transactions and related transactions. This announcement caused the price of &lt;a href=\"bitcoin\"&gt;bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; to fall approximately 8%. The central bank also banned foreign companies from providing cryptocurrency services to Chinese citizens. Regulations from earlier in the year had banned domestic companies from providing services like cryptocurrency trading.\nRestriction of for-profit tutoring.\nOn July 24, 2021, rules were introduced to change the operation of tutoring companies focused on teaching school-age children. The new rules prohibit these companies from turning a profit, prohibit them from raising foreign capital, and prohibit tutoring related to the school syllabus on holidays and weekends. Other regulations include the banning of the tutoring of children under six years old. Commentators referred to the new regulations as, effectively, a \"death penalty\" for the industry. American investment firms impacted by the new rules include &lt;a href=\"Sequoia%20Capital\"&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Global%20Management\"&gt;Tiger Global Management&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Warburg%20Pincus\"&gt;Warburg Pincus&lt;/a&gt;. Other foreign firms impacted include Singapore's &lt;a href=\"Temasek%20Holdings\"&gt;Temasek Holdings&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ban resulted in the emergence of \"underground\" tutoring services, advertised using other descriptions by those offering them. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Education%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Ministry of Education&lt;/a&gt; announced it would seek to eliminate these services by pursuing companies and individuals offering them in September 2021.\nRegulatory scrutiny of Didi.\nDidi, a Chinese vehicle for hire company headquartered in Beijing, went public in June 2021. The company listed in the United States, becoming the largest Chinese trading debut since Alibaba's IPO in 2014. On July 4, 2021, the &lt;a href=\"Cyberspace%20Administration%20of%20China\"&gt;Cyberspace Administration of China&lt;/a&gt; ordered app stores to remove Didi, after citing violations on the company's collection and usage of personal information. Didi had disclosed to potential investors that increased regulatory scrutiny was possible. In July Chinese regulators fined Didi for failing to disclose acquisitions. Didi allegedly considered going private in late July. The company denied these claims were true.\nRegulators asked Didi to create a plan to delist from American exchanges in November 2021. The company initially intended to either return to its previous status as a private company or to relist in Hong Kong.\nOther reforms and actions.\nThree child policy.\nChina modified its longstanding &lt;a href=\"one%20child%20policy\"&gt;one child policy&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 and allowed couples to have two children. The policy was updated again in 2021, allowing couples to have three children. This modification to policy was announced on 31 May 2021 at a meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Politburo%20of%20the%20Chinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;. The policy went into effect in August 2021.\nLabor laws.\nOn August 27, 2021, the Supreme People\u2019s Court with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security issued a public notice that China's &lt;a href=\"996%20working%20hour%20system\"&gt;996 work schedule&lt;/a&gt; utilized by big technology companies was illegal. While no new laws were implemented, it signaled that the government will step up enforcement of existing laws, under which the 996 work schedule should not exist and overtime beyond 44 hours per week should be paid out.\nFines.\nThe State Administration for Market Regulation fined &lt;a href=\"Meituan\"&gt;Meituan&lt;/a&gt; $534 million in October 2021 in response to its practice of demanding that retailers using their app sign exclusivity agreements. The fine was lower than expected, leading to an increase in Meituan's share price.\nContemporaneous events.\nEvergrande liquidity crisis.\nDespite the \"three red lines\", Chinese real estate developer and conglomerate Evergrande released a statement on 31 August 2021, warning it would default on its debts if it failed to raise enough cash to cover them. At the time, Evergrande was China's most indebted real estate developer. On 24 September 2021, Evergrande missed off-shore bond payments totaling US$83.5 million. While the company has 30 days to avoid defaulting on the debt, analysts feel the company will likely fail to pay its creditors.\nFuture plans.\nThe &lt;a href=\"State%20Council%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;State Council of the People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Chinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; together released a five-year plan outlining plans for regulations and updated laws in August 2021. The plan calls for the continued introduction of rules and reform governing portions of the economy including the technology sector, finance, and defense."
