    "text": "The Stock Exchange Building () is a &lt;a href=\"building\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; originally erected for the &lt;a href=\"Stockholm%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;Stockholm Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; between 1773 and 1778 from construction drawings by &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Palmstedt\"&gt;Erik Palmstedt&lt;/a&gt;. The stock exchange moved out of the building completely in 1998. It is located on the north side of the square &lt;a href=\"Stortorget\"&gt;Stortorget&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gamla%20stan\"&gt;Gamla stan&lt;/a&gt;, the old town in central &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, and owned by the city council. Since 1914 it has been the home of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Academy\"&gt;Swedish Academy&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the building for its meetings, such as those at which it selects and announces the name of the recipient of the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize%20for%20Literature\"&gt;Nobel Prize for Literature&lt;/a&gt;. The building also houses the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Museum\"&gt;Nobel Museum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Library\"&gt;Nobel Library&lt;/a&gt;."
