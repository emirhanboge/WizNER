    "text": "Der Evangelimann (\"The Evangelist\") is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; in two acts by the Austrian composer &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Kienzl\"&gt;Wilhelm Kienzl&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt;, by the composer, is based on short story \"\". It was adapted in 1924 as a silent film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Evangelist%20%281924%20film%29\"&gt;The Evangelist&lt;/a&gt;\".\nComposition history.\nKienzl composed the opera in a relatively short space of time during 1894 in &lt;a href=\"Graz\"&gt;Graz&lt;/a&gt; and in the little Austrian town of &lt;a href=\"V%C3%B6cklabruck\"&gt;V\u00f6cklabruck&lt;/a&gt;. When he played extracts from the score to conductor &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Muck\"&gt;Karl Muck&lt;/a&gt; and Count (then &lt;a href=\"artistic%20director\"&gt;artistic director&lt;/a&gt; of the Berlin Opera), they immediately secured the rights to the premiere. The score was published by Bote &amp; Bock Berlin, now part of &lt;a href=\"Boosey%20%26amp%3B%20Hawkes\"&gt;Boosey &amp; Hawkes&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance history.\nThe opera was first performed at the on 4 May 1895. It was a triumphant success. Within only a few years most German and Austrian opera houses had the work in their repertory. Famous conductors such as &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Mottl\"&gt;Felix Mottl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Mahler\"&gt;Gustav Mahler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Schalk\"&gt;Franz Schalk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Strauss\"&gt;Richard Strauss&lt;/a&gt; gave it their support, and the title role of the Evangelist Mathias was sung by prominent tenors. On 17 January 1927, Kienzl celebrated his 70th birthday by conducting the work at the &lt;a href=\"Vienna%20State%20Opera\"&gt;Vienna State Opera&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Lotte%20Lehmann\"&gt;Lotte Lehmann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Tauber\"&gt;Richard Tauber&lt;/a&gt; in the leading roles. The cast also included Hermann Wiedemann, &lt;a href=\"Bella%20Paalen\"&gt;Bella Paalen&lt;/a&gt; and Franz Markhoff.\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\nMathias, clerk in the monastery of St. Othmar, is in love with Martha, the foster daughter of the magistrate Friedrich Engel. Mathias\u2019s brother Johannes is jealous of Martha\u2019s affection and starts an intrigue against him. When the magistrate is informed of what is happening between his charge and Mathias, he dismisses the clerk and expels him from the monastery. Martha resists Johannes\u2019s intrusiveness. When Johannes witnesses Martha and Mathias swearing fidelity to each other at their farewell, his jealousy turns into blind hate and he sets the monastery on fire. It is not he, however, but Mathias, who is arrested as the alleged wrongdoer.\nAct 2.\nMathias has served a twenty-year sentence and, having been denied re-integration into society, travels the country as an itinerant preacher (this act contains the most popular piece in the opera: \"\", sung by Mathias and a children's chorus). Martha took her life after his imprisonment, Johannes has become rich by dishonest means and lives in Vienna, now a severely ill man. Thirty years after the events at St. Othmar the brothers meet again. Mathias forgives Johannes, who can thus die in peace."
