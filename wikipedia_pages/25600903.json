    "text": "The Apple USB Mouse (model number M4848), commonly called the \"Hockey puck\" because of its unusual shape, is a &lt;a href=\"Mouse%20%28computing%29\"&gt;mouse&lt;/a&gt; released by &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Inc.\"&gt;Apple Computer, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; It was first released with the Bondi Blue &lt;a href=\"iMac%20G3\"&gt;iMac G3&lt;/a&gt; in 1998 and included with all successive desktop Macs for the next two years. It was the first commercially released Apple mouse to use the &lt;a href=\"USB\"&gt;USB&lt;/a&gt; connection format and not the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Desktop%20Bus\"&gt;Apple Desktop Bus&lt;/a&gt; (ADB). Many reviewers criticized the mouse for its design; in 2008, Bryan Gardiner of Wired.com deemed the mouse to be among \"Apple's most notorious flops.\"\nDesign and criticism.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Mouse%20II\"&gt;Mouse II&lt;/a&gt; that preceded it, the \"hockey puck\" mouse has a circular shape; it has a single mouse button located at the top, like previous Apple mice. The mouse's round shape is widely considered clumsy, due to its small size and tendency to rotate in use. The graphite mouse has an indentation on its button showing where to press. This was a major cause for the success of the Griffin &lt;a href=\"iMate\"&gt;iMate&lt;/a&gt; ADB to USB adapters, as they allowed the older, more comfortable ADB Mouse II to be used with those iMacs. There were some products like the \"iCatch\", a shell that attached to the USB mouse to give it the ADB mouse's &lt;a href=\"Ellipse\"&gt;elliptical&lt;/a&gt; shape.\nAnother flaw introduced in the Apple USB Mouse, shared across all of Apple's USB offerings, is the atypically short cord. Though intended for use through the integrated &lt;a href=\"USB%20hub\"&gt;hub&lt;/a&gt; in Apple's keyboards, Apple's transition to USB coincided with the relocation of ports on their notebooks from the center to the left edge.\nLegacy.\nIn 2000, the Apple USB Mouse was replaced with the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Pro%20Mouse\"&gt;Apple Pro Mouse&lt;/a&gt;.
