    "text": "Isola Comacina is a small wooded island of &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Como\"&gt;Lake Como&lt;/a&gt;, administratively a part of the &lt;a href=\"comune\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ossuccio\"&gt;Ossuccio&lt;/a&gt;. It is located close to the western shore of the Como arm of the lake in front of a gulf known as \"Zoca de l'oli\", a &lt;a href=\"Lombard%20language\"&gt;Lombard&lt;/a&gt; name referring to the local small-scale production of &lt;a href=\"olive%20oil\"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;. In the late 6th century (c. 587) the island was a remaining &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; stronghold under Francio, a subordinate of &lt;a href=\"Narses\"&gt;Narses&lt;/a&gt;; though the areas surrounding &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Como\"&gt;Lake Como&lt;/a&gt; were entirely controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Lombards\"&gt;Lombards&lt;/a&gt;. The island was besieged for a good deal of time by the &lt;a href=\"Lombards\"&gt;Lombards&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Authari\"&gt;Authari&lt;/a&gt; who released Francio to flee back to &lt;a href=\"Narses\"&gt;Narses&lt;/a&gt;' capital at &lt;a href=\"Ravenna\"&gt;Ravenna&lt;/a&gt;. The Lombards found the island to contain \"many riches\" deposited for safekeeping by local Roman loyalists.\nThe island was invaded in 1169 by &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Barbarossa\"&gt;Frederick Barbarossa&lt;/a&gt; and soldiers from the town of Como. In 1175, Vidulfo, the Bishop of Como, cursed the island with the following words, \"The bells will never ring, the rocks will never be placed one over the other, nobody will do here the work of the publican, the punishment a violent death.\"\nIn 1919 the island was given to Belgium, in homage to King &lt;a href=\"Albert%20I%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;Albert I&lt;/a&gt;. The island was returned the following year.\nPietro Lingeri built three houses on the island in 1939. His idea was to turn the island into a colony for artists. The houses were built in a rationalist style, made from local materials and without much decoration.\nThe island now consists of a restaurant, cafe, a collection of archaeological sites and the three artist houses."
