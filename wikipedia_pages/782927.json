    "text": "August Oetker (; January 6, 1862 \u2013 January 10, 1918) was a German inventor, food scientist and businessman. He is known as the creator of &lt;a href=\"baking%20powder\"&gt;baking powder&lt;/a&gt; as a ready-to-use product, and also as the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Oetker\"&gt;Dr. Oetker&lt;/a&gt; company.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nOetker was born on January 6, 1862, in &lt;a href=\"Obernkirchen\"&gt;Obernkirchen&lt;/a&gt;, Germany.\nCareer.\nIn 1891, he bought the Aschoffsche pharmacy in &lt;a href=\"Bielefeld\"&gt;Bielefeld&lt;/a&gt; and developed a baking agent, which was designed to ensure the success of the baking process. Prior to Oetker, a British chemist, &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Bird\"&gt;Alfred Bird&lt;/a&gt;, had already invented baking powder.\nFrom 1890, he distributed his invention under the brand name \"Backin\", thus laying the basis for the family-owned company, called &lt;a href=\"Oetker-Gruppe\"&gt;Oetker-Gruppe&lt;/a&gt;. The company still uses the very same recipe to produce baking powder. On September 21, 1909, Oetker filed a patent for his \"Procedure for making long-lasting baking powder or ready-to-bake flour\".\nDue to successful marketing, his products sold quite well and soon the old pharmacy had turned into a successful company. In 1900, Oetker built his first manufacturing plant and, by 1906, had sold 50 million packages of Backin.\nDeath and legacy.\nOetker died on January 10, 1918, in &lt;a href=\"Bielefeld\"&gt;Bielefeld&lt;/a&gt;, Germany. Later, his grandson, &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20August%20Oetker\"&gt;Rudolf August Oetker&lt;/a&gt;, took over the company.\nMotto: (\"A bright mind always uses Oetker.\")."
