    "text": "This martial arts timeline is designed to help describe the history of the &lt;a href=\"martial%20arts\"&gt;martial arts&lt;/a&gt; in a linear fashion. Many of the articles for particular styles have discussions of their history. This article is designed to help visualize the development of these arts, to help better understand the progression of the separate styles and illustrate where they interrelate.\nThe &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20martial%20arts\"&gt;history of martial arts&lt;/a&gt; is challenging to document precisely, because of the lack of historical records, secretive nature of the teacher-student relationships and political circumstances during much of its history. It is likely that many techniques were learned, forgotten, and re-learned during human history."
