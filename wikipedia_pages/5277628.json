Moorhead&lt;/a&gt; in a district taking in most of Pittsburgh. He was reelected ten times, never facing serious opposition. He was a longtime member of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means\"&gt;United States House Committee on Ways and Means&lt;/a&gt;\nRetirement and death.\nIn 2002, Coyne's district was combined with the district of &lt;a href=\"Michael%20F.%20Doyle\"&gt;Mike Doyle&lt;/a&gt;, a somewhat more moderate Democrat. Although the new district contained more of Coyne's territory than Doyle's, Coyne retired to avoid the possibility of two Democratic &lt;a href=\"incumbents\"&gt;incumbents&lt;/a&gt; facing each other in the &lt;a href=\"primary%20elections\"&gt;primary elections&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoyne died at the age of 77 on November 3, 2013, two months after falling and sustaining head injuries."
