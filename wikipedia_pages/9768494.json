    "text": "Black Butte (formerly Wintoon Butte, Cone Mountain, Sugar Loaf and Muir's Peak) is a cluster of overlapping &lt;a href=\"dacite\"&gt;dacite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lava%20dome\"&gt;lava dome&lt;/a&gt;s in a &lt;a href=\"butte\"&gt;butte&lt;/a&gt;,\na &lt;a href=\"satellite%20cone\"&gt;satellite cone&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Shasta\"&gt;Mount Shasta&lt;/a&gt;. It is located directly adjacent to the northbound lanes of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%205\"&gt;Interstate 5&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20exits%20on%20Interstate%205\"&gt;milepost 742&lt;/a&gt; between the city of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Shasta%2C%20California\"&gt;Mount Shasta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weed%2C%20California\"&gt;Weed, California&lt;/a&gt;. The highway crosses a pass, Black Butte Summit, at the western base of the lava domes. The lava domes were extruded at the foot of the cone of &lt;a href=\"Shastina\"&gt;Shastina&lt;/a&gt; following the period of its major eruptions about 9,000\u201310,000 years ago.\nA &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Forest%20Service\"&gt;United States Forest Service&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fire%20lookout%20tower\"&gt;fire lookout tower&lt;/a&gt; was built on the summit in the early 1930s, but destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"Columbus%20Day%20Storm%20of%201962\"&gt;Columbus Day Storm of 1962&lt;/a&gt;. A new lookout was built in 1963 and operated until 1973. The building was moved by helicopter to a new location in 1975 and only the concrete foundation remains today. A trail leads to the summit from a &lt;a href=\"trailhead\"&gt;trailhead&lt;/a&gt; accessible by &lt;a href=\"gravel%20road\"&gt;gravel road&lt;/a&gt;s off the Everitt Memorial Highway.\nThe summit boasts an outstanding view of the southwest side of Shasta and Shastina, and on clear days &lt;a href=\"Mount%20McLoughlin\"&gt;Mount McLoughlin&lt;/a&gt; is easily visible to the north in Oregon. &lt;a href=\"Lassen%20Peak\"&gt;Lassen Peak&lt;/a&gt; is visible around to the south."
