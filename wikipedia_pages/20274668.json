    "text": "The Blohm &amp; Voss Ha 140 was a German multi-purpose &lt;a href=\"seaplane\"&gt;seaplane&lt;/a&gt; first flown in 1937. It was intended for use as a &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20bomber\"&gt;torpedo bomber&lt;/a&gt; or long-range &lt;a href=\"Aerial%20reconnaissance\"&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt; aircraft but did not enter production.\nDesign and development.\nThe Ha 140 was developed to meet a requirement for a twin-engine &lt;a href=\"floatplane\"&gt;floatplane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"reconnaissance%20aircraft\"&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"torpedo%20bomber\"&gt;torpedo bomber&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ha 140 had an all-metal structure of conventional cantilever monoplane layout, with twin floats on pylons beneath its twin wing-mounted engines. The high-mounted wing had a straight centre section and slight &lt;a href=\"dihedral%20%28aeronautics%29\"&gt;dihedral&lt;/a&gt; on the outer sections.\nThe crew consisted of a pilot and radio operator, with a gunner in a revolving &lt;a href=\"Gun%20turret\"&gt;turret&lt;/a&gt; in the nose or in a second gun position to the rear. The &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; or bomb load was accommodated in an internal &lt;a href=\"bomb%20bay\"&gt;bomb bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThree &lt;a href=\"prototype\"&gt;prototype&lt;/a&gt;s were built and the design beat the competing &lt;a href=\"Heinkel%20He%20115\"&gt;Heinkel He 115&lt;/a&gt;. However, by then B&amp;V did not have enough spare manufacturing capacity for series production and declined the order, which went to Heinkel instead.\nIn 1940 the third prototype was modified to test the tail design and variable-incidence wing mechanism used on the &lt;a href=\"Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss%20BV%20144\"&gt;BV 144&lt;/a&gt; transport."
