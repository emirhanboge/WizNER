    "text": "The dynamical system concept is a &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"formal%20system\"&gt;formalization&lt;/a&gt; for any fixed \"rule\" that describes the &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; dependence of a point's position in its ambient &lt;a href=\"space\"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;. The concept unifies very different types of such \"rules\" in mathematics: the different choices made for how time is measured and the special properties of the ambient space may give an idea of the vastness of the class of objects described by this concept. Time can be measured by integers, by &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"complex%20number\"&gt;complex number&lt;/a&gt;s or can be a more general algebraic object, losing the memory of its physical origin, and the ambient space may be simply a &lt;a href=\"Set%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;, without the need of a &lt;a href=\"Differentiability\"&gt;smooth&lt;/a&gt; space-time structure defined on it.\nFormal definition.\nThere are two classes of definitions for a dynamical system: one is motivated by &lt;a href=\"ordinary%20differential%20equation\"&gt;ordinary differential equation&lt;/a&gt;s and is geometrical in flavor; and the other is motivated by &lt;a href=\"ergodic%20theory\"&gt;ergodic theory&lt;/a&gt; and is &lt;a href=\"Measure%20%28mathematics%29%23Measure%20theory\"&gt;measure theoretical&lt;/a&gt; in flavor. The measure theoretical definitions assume the existence of a measure-preserving transformation. This appears to exclude &lt;a href=\"dissipative%20system\"&gt;dissipative system&lt;/a&gt;s, as in a dissipative system a small region of phase space shrinks under time evolution. A simple construction (sometimes called the &lt;a href=\"Krylov%E2%80%93Bogolyubov%20theorem\"&gt;Krylov\u2013Bogolyubov theorem&lt;/a&gt;) shows that it is always possible to construct a measure so as to make the evolution rule of the dynamical system a measure-preserving transformation. In the construction a given measure of the state space is summed for all future points of a trajectory, assuring the invariance.\nThe difficulty in constructing the natural measure for a dynamical system makes it difficult to develop ergodic theory starting from differential equations, so it becomes convenient to have a dynamical systems-motivated definition within ergodic theory that side-steps the choice of measure.\nGeneral definition.\nIn the most general sense,\na dynamical system is a &lt;a href=\"tuple\"&gt;tuple&lt;/a&gt; (\"T\", \"X\", \u03a6) where \"T\" is a &lt;a href=\"monoid\"&gt;monoid&lt;/a&gt;, written additively, \"X\" is a non-empty &lt;a href=\"set%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; and \u03a6 is a &lt;a href=\"function%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;\nwith\nand for any \"x\" in \"X\":\nfor formula_6 and formula_7, where we have defined the set formula_8 for any \"x\" in \"X\".\nIn particular, in the case that formula_9 we have for every \"x\" in \"X\" that formula_10 and thus that \u03a6 defines a &lt;a href=\"Semigroup_action\"&gt;monoid action&lt;/a&gt; of \"T\" on \"X\".\nThe function \u03a6(\"t\",\"x\") is called the evolution function of the dynamical system: it associates to every point \"x\" in the set \"X\" a unique image, depending on the variable \"t\", called the evolution parameter. \"X\" is called &lt;a href=\"phase%20space\"&gt;phase space&lt;/a&gt; or state space, while the variable \"x\" represents an initial state of the system.\nWe often write \nif we take one of the variables as constant. \nis called the flow through \"x\" and its &lt;a href=\"graph%20%28function%29\"&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trajectory\"&gt;trajectory&lt;/a&gt; through \"x\". The set\nis called the &lt;a href=\"orbit%20%28dynamics%29\"&gt;orbit&lt;/a&gt; through \"x\".\nNote that the orbit through \"x\" is the &lt;a href=\"image%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; of the flow through \"x\".\nA subset \"S\" of the state space \"X\" is called \u03a6-invariant if for all \"x\" in \"S\" and all \"t\" in \"T\"\nThus, in particular, if \"S\" is \u03a6-invariant, formula_16 for all \"x\" in \"S\". That is, the flow through \"x\" must be defined for all time for every element of \"S\".\nGeometrical cases.\nIn the following cases, \"M\" is a &lt;a href=\"manifold\"&gt;manifold&lt;/a&gt; (or its extreme case a &lt;a href=\"Graph%20%28discrete%20mathematics%29\"&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt;). Dynamical systems are defined as &lt;a href=\"tuple\"&gt;tuple&lt;/a&gt;s of which one element is a manifold.\nReal dynamical system.\nA \"real dynamical system\", \"real-time dynamical system\", \"&lt;a href=\"continuous%20time\"&gt;continuous time&lt;/a&gt; dynamical system\", or \"&lt;a href=\"Flow%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt;\" is a tuple (\"T\", \"M\", \u03a6) with \"T\" an &lt;a href=\"open%20interval\"&gt;open interval&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real number&lt;/a&gt;s R, \"M\" a &lt;a href=\"manifold\"&gt;manifold&lt;/a&gt; locally &lt;a href=\"diffeomorphic\"&gt;diffeomorphic&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Banach%20space\"&gt;Banach space&lt;/a&gt;, and \u03a6 a &lt;a href=\"continuous%20function\"&gt;continuous function&lt;/a&gt;. If \"T\" = R we call the system \"global\", if \"T\" is restricted to the non-negative reals we call the system a \"semi-flow\". If \u03a6 is &lt;a href=\"continuously%20differentiable\"&gt;continuously differentiable&lt;/a&gt; we say the system is a \"differentiable dynamical system\". If the manifold \"M\" is locally diffeomorphic to R\"n\", the dynamical system is \"finite-dimensional\"; if not, the dynamical system is \"infinite-dimensional\". Note that this does not assume a &lt;a href=\"symplectic%20manifold\"&gt;symplectic structure&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiscrete dynamical system.\nA \"discrete dynamical system\", \"&lt;a href=\"discrete-time\"&gt;discrete-time&lt;/a&gt; dynamical system\", \"map\" or \"cascade\" is a tuple (\"T\", \"M\", \u03a6) where \"T\" is the set of &lt;a href=\"integer\"&gt;integer&lt;/a&gt;s, \"M\" is a &lt;a href=\"manifold\"&gt;manifold&lt;/a&gt; locally diffeomorphic to a &lt;a href=\"Banach%20space\"&gt;Banach space&lt;/a&gt;, and \u03a6 is a function. If \"T\" is restricted to the non-negative integers we call the system a \"semi-cascade\".\nCellular automaton.\nA \"cellular automaton\" is a tuple (\"T\", \"M\", \u03a6), with \"T\" a &lt;a href=\"lattice%20%28group%29\"&gt;lattice&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"integer\"&gt;integer&lt;/a&gt;s or a higher-dimensional &lt;a href=\"integer%20lattice\"&gt;integer grid&lt;/a&gt;, \"M\" is a set of functions from an integer lattice (again, with one or more dimensions) to a finite set, and \u03a6 a (locally defined) evolution function. As such &lt;a href=\"cellular%20automata\"&gt;cellular automata&lt;/a&gt; are dynamical systems. The lattice in \"M\" represents the \"space\" lattice, while the one in \"T\" represents the \"time\" lattice.\nMeasure theoretical definition.\nA dynamical system may be defined formally, as a measure-preserving transformation of a &lt;a href=\"measure%20space\"&gt;measure space&lt;/a&gt;, the triplet (\"T\", (\"X\", \u03a3, \"\u03bc\"), \u03a6). Here, \"T\" is a monoid (usually the non-negative integers), \"X\" is a &lt;a href=\"set%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;, and (\"X\", \u03a3, \"\u03bc\") is a &lt;a href=\"measure%20space\"&gt;probability space&lt;/a&gt;. A map \u03a6: \"X\" \u2192 \"X\" is said to be &lt;a href=\"measurable%20function\"&gt;\u03a3-measurable&lt;/a&gt; if and only if, for every \"\u03c3\" in \u03a3, one has \u03a6\u22121(\"\u03c3\") \u2208 \u03a3. A map \u03a6 is said to preserve the measure if and only if, for every \"\u03c3\" in \u03a3, one has \"\u03bc\"(\u03a6\u22121(\"\u03c3\")) = \"\u03bc\"(\"\u03c3\"). Combining the above, a map \u03a6 is said to be a measure-preserving transformation of \"X\" , if it is a map from \"X\" to itself, it is \u03a3-measurable, and is measure-preserving. The triplet (\"T\", (\"X\", \u03a3, \"\u03bc\"), \u03a6), for such a \u03a6, is then defined to be a dynamical system.\nThe map \u03a6 embodies the time evolution of the dynamical system. Thus, for discrete dynamical systems the &lt;a href=\"iterated%20function\"&gt;iterates&lt;/a&gt; formula_17 for every integer \"n\" are studied. For continuous dynamical systems, the map \u03a6 is understood to be finite time evolution map and the construction is more complicated.\nRelation to geometric definition.\nMany different invariant measures can be associated to any one evolution rule. In ergodic theory the choice is assumed made, but if the dynamical system is given by a system of differential equations the appropriate measure must be determined. Some systems have a natural measure, such as the &lt;a href=\"Liouville%27s%20theorem%20%28Hamiltonian%29\"&gt;Liouville measure&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hamiltonian%20system\"&gt;Hamiltonian system&lt;/a&gt;s, chosen over other invariant measures, such as the measures supported on periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian system. For many dissipative chaotic systems the choice of invariant measure is technically more challenging. The measure needs to be supported on the &lt;a href=\"attractor\"&gt;attractor&lt;/a&gt;, but attractors have zero &lt;a href=\"Lebesgue%20measure\"&gt;Lebesgue measure&lt;/a&gt; and the invariant measures must be singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure.\nFor hyperbolic dynamical systems, the &lt;a href=\"Sinai%E2%80%93Ruelle%E2%80%93Bowen%20measure\"&gt;Sinai\u2013Ruelle\u2013Bowen measure&lt;/a&gt;s appear to be the natural choice. They are constructed on the geometrical structure of &lt;a href=\"stable%20manifold\"&gt;stable and unstable manifold&lt;/a&gt;s of the dynamical system; they behave physically under small perturbations; and they explain many of the observed statistics of hyperbolic systems.\nConstruction of dynamical systems.\nThe concept of \"evolution in time\" is central to the theory of dynamical systems as seen in the previous sections: the basic reason for this fact is that the starting motivation of the theory was the study of time behavior of &lt;a href=\"classical%20mechanics\"&gt;classical mechanical systems&lt;/a&gt;, that is, the study of the &lt;a href=\"initial%20value%20problem\"&gt;initial value problem&lt;/a&gt;s for their describing systems of &lt;a href=\"ordinary%20differential%20equation\"&gt;ordinary differential equation&lt;/a&gt;s.\nwhere \nThe solution is the evolution function already introduced in above\nSome formal manipulation of the system of &lt;a href=\"differential%20equation\"&gt;differential equation&lt;/a&gt;s shown above gives a more general form of equations a dynamical system must satisfy\nwhere &lt;math&gt;\\mathfrak{G}:"
