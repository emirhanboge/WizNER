    "text": "Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) is an &lt;a href=\"electric%20locomotive\"&gt;electric locomotive&lt;/a&gt; manufacturer based in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. The works are located at &lt;a href=\"Chittaranjan\"&gt;Chittaranjan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Asansol%20Sadar%20subdivision\"&gt;Asansol Sadar subdivision&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;, with an ancillary unit in &lt;a href=\"Dankuni\"&gt;Dankuni&lt;/a&gt;. The main unit is 32\u00a0km from &lt;a href=\"Asansol\"&gt;Asansol&lt;/a&gt; and 237\u00a0km from &lt;a href=\"Kolkata\"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt;. CLW has stores and offices in Kolkata, as well as inspection cells in New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Bangalore. It is the largest locomotive manufacturer unit in the world, producing 431 locomotives in 2019\u201320.\nHistory.\nIn the late 1930s, a committee consisting of M/s Humphries and Shrinivasan was created to consider the economic possibilities of establishing locomotive manufacturing facilities in India. The initial project at &lt;a href=\"Chandmari\"&gt;Chandmari&lt;/a&gt;, east of &lt;a href=\"Kalyani%2C%20West%20Bengal\"&gt;Kalyani&lt;/a&gt; in West Bengal, was found to be unsuitable due to the &lt;a href=\"Partition%20of%20India\"&gt;partition&lt;/a&gt;. A new survey led to the present site at Chittaranjan being established, which was approved by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Railways%20%28India%29\"&gt;railway board&lt;/a&gt; in 1947. A survey of the proposed area began on January 9, 1948; the rocky soil was an advantage in erecting structural foundations, and the undulating terrain solved the problem of drainage for the township. The &lt;a href=\"Damodar%20Valley%20Corporation\"&gt;Damodar Valley Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (DVC) envisioned hydro-electric and thermal power stations in the area, assuring adequate power availability for the project.\nThe project was launched as Loco Building Works in 1950 to produce 120 average-sized &lt;a href=\"steam%20locomotive\"&gt;steam locomotive&lt;/a&gt;s. It also had the capacity to manufacture 50 spare boilers. Production of steam locomotives commenced on January 26, 1950. The first President of India, &lt;a href=\"Rajendra%20Prasad\"&gt;Rajendra Prasad&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated the first steam locomotive to the nation on 1 November 1950, and on the same day, the Loco Building Works was renamed as Chittaranjan Locomotive Works after &lt;a href=\"Deshbandhu%20Chittaranjan%20Das\"&gt;Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das&lt;/a&gt;. The nearby &lt;a href=\"Chittaranjan%20railway%20station\"&gt;Mihijam Station&lt;/a&gt; was also renamed as Chittaranjan.\nIn 1962-63, a steel foundry was set up to manufacture cast steel locomotive parts. Production of &lt;a href=\"Diesel%20locomotive\"&gt;diesel-hydraulic locomotives&lt;/a&gt; began in 1968. After manufacturing 2351 steam locomotives of 5 types and 842 diesel-hydraulic locomotives of 7 types, production of both of these classes was discontinued from 1950 to 1972 and 1968 to 1993, respectively. Electric locomotive production commenced in 1961. The first Prime Minister of India, &lt;a href=\"Jawaharlal%20Nehru\"&gt;Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru&lt;/a&gt;, commissioned the first 1500 V DC Locomotive named \"Lokmanya\" on 14 October 1961. The production of 25 kV AC DC locomotives commenced on 16 November 1963, with the WAG-1 series, a &lt;a href=\"Broad-gauge%20railway\"&gt;broad-gauge&lt;/a&gt; 25 kV A.C. freight locomotive with 2840\u00a0hp and a maximum speed of 80\u00a0km/h. The first WAG-1 locomotive was named \"Bidhan\".\nCLW gradually began upgrading their locomotives to produce 6000\u00a0hp and achieve 160\u00a0km/h, and also started building the 25 kV AC/1500 V DC, AC/DC WCAM-1 series for hauling mail/express trains on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Railway%20zone\"&gt;Western Railway&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, production of DC traction motors and control equipment commenced in April 1967. CLW became the first manufacturer in India (as well as the second in Asia and fifth in the world) to manufacture a 3-phase GTO Thyristor-controlled electric locomotive. The first WAG-9 series locomotivethe first indigenous 6000\u00a0hp freight electric locomotivewas rolled out on 14 November 1988, and christened \"Navyug\".10 May 2000 \"Navodit\", the first passenger version of the WAP-5\u00a0series with a service speed of 160\u00a0km/h and the potential to reach 200\u00a0km/h, was manufactured; the project's highest-priority items are the development of material sourcing, indigenization, and cost reduction.\nCLW has in-house facilities for machining and assembly of wheelsets, fabrication, bogies, etc. The facilities include modern CNC machines, plasma cutting machines, and inert gas welding sets. The factory obtains its iron &amp; steel from &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Authority%20of%20India\"&gt;SAIL&lt;/a&gt;, RINL and MDN, and sometimes from private steel plants like &lt;a href=\"Tata%20Group\"&gt;TATA&lt;/a&gt;, Jamshespur, and &lt;a href=\"Jindal%20Steel%20and%20Power\"&gt;Jindal Steel&lt;/a&gt;. Hydroelectric power comes from &lt;a href=\"Power%20Grid%20Corporation%20of%20India\"&gt;PGCIL&lt;/a&gt; and the DVC's &lt;a href=\"Maithon%20Dam\"&gt;Maithon dam&lt;/a&gt;.\nCLW's environment conservation efforts have been recognized by the World Environment Foundation, and was awarded the Golden Peacock Award for Environment Management 2006. CLW has fully complied with the provisions of the Industrial Safety Act, 1948 and was awarded the Safety Innovation Award in 2006 and 2009 by India's Institute of Engineers.."
