He served as a &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; member of the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20State%20Senate\"&gt;Pennsylvania Senate&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Senate%2C%20District%2016\"&gt;16th district&lt;/a&gt; from 1851 to 1854 and 1859 to 1860. He also served in the Pennsylvania Senate for the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Senate%2C%20District%2013\"&gt;13th district&lt;/a&gt; from 1858 to 1861 and as &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Ambassador%20to%20Ecuador\"&gt;Minister Resident for Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; from 1858 to 1861. He served as a &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20senator\"&gt;U.S. senator&lt;/a&gt; for Pennsylvania from 1863 to 1869, a U.S. representative for Pennsylvania's &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%27s%2011th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;11th district&lt;/a&gt; from 1887 to 1889 and a U.S. representative for Pennsylvania's &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%27s%2017th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;17th district&lt;/a&gt; from 1889 to 1891.\nEarly life and education.\nBuckalew was born in &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20Creek%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Fishing Creek Township, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; on December 28, 1821 to John McKinney Sr. and Martha Funston Buckalew. He was a graduate of &lt;a href=\"Harford%20Academy\"&gt;Harford Academy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Susquehanna%20County\"&gt;Susquehanna County&lt;/a&gt;, Pennsylvania, where he studied &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;. He was admitted to the bar in 1843.\nCareer.\nBuckalew was the most influential early advocate of &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. His proposals for a type of voting system known as &lt;a href=\"cumulative%20voting\"&gt;cumulative voting&lt;/a&gt; gained significant support in Congress, and he played a central role in the adoption of cumulative voting in several places, including Illinois for state legislative elections in 1870, a system that lasted in that state until 1980.\nBuckalew was &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Pennsylvania%2C%201863\"&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;Pennsylvania General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. Senate in 1863. In a number of speeches, notably in the Senate on July 11, 1867; at a large public meeting in Philadelphia in November of the same year; before the Social Science Association at Philadelphia in October 1870; and in the Senate of Pennsylvania on March 27, 1871; as well as in the report of the Select Committee on Representative Reform of the United States Senate, of which be was chairman, Buckalew argued persuasively for the use of cumulative voting in the election of representatives in Congress, state legislatures, town councils and other bodies.\nBuckalew's bill in the Senate would have allowed all the electors of a state to have the number of votes equal to the number of house of representatives members to be elected from that state. The voter could give all his votes to one candidate, or distribute them in any fashion, equally or unequally, among candidates. The candidates with the highest number of votes would be elected.\nIn addition to serving in Congress and the Pennsylvania state legislature, Buckalew was commissioner to exchange ratifications of a treaty with &lt;a href=\"Paraguay\"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt; in 1854; chairman of the Democratic State committee in 1857; appointed one of the commissioners to revise the penal code of Pennsylvania in 1857; Minister Resident to the Republic of &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; 1858-1861; unsuccessful candidate for governor of Pennsylvania in 1872; and a delegate to the Pennsylvania constitutional convention of 1873.\nHe resumed the practice of law when he left Congress in 1891, age 69, in Bloomsburg, Columbia County, where he died on May 19, 1899. He is interred in Rosemont Cemetery in Bloomsburg.\nBuckalew's writings and speeches on cumulative voting were collected in an 1872 book titled \"Proportional Representation\". 1872, Philadelphia, J.
