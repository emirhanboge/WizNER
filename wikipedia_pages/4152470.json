    "text": "Brussels-South railway station (, , &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20IATA-indexed%20railway%20stations\"&gt;IATA code&lt;/a&gt;: ZYR), officially Brussels-South (, ), is a major &lt;a href=\"railway%20station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. It is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20railway%20stations%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;busiest station in Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. Geographically it is located in the commute of &lt;a href=\"Saint-Gilles%2C%20Belgium\"&gt;Saint-Gilles/Sint-Gillis&lt;/a&gt; on the border with the adjacent &lt;a href=\"Anderlecht\"&gt;Anderlecht&lt;/a&gt; and just south of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Brussels\"&gt;City of Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. The station is the only Brussels stop of international high speed rail services, &lt;a href=\"Eurostar\"&gt;Eurostar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalys\"&gt;Thalys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intercity%20Express\"&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt;. Brussels-South is one of over a dozen railway stations in the Belgian capital, and one of the three principal rail stations in the hearth of the city, the two others being &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Central%20Station\"&gt;Brussels-Central&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brussels-North%20railway%20station\"&gt;Brussels-North&lt;/a&gt;. \nUnderneath Brussels-South is the rapid transit / station on lines &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Metro%20line%202\"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20tram%20route%203\"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20tram%20route%204\"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Metro%20line%206\"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Metro\"&gt;Brussels Metro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20premetro\"&gt;\"premetro\"&lt;/a&gt; (underground tram) systems, and serves as an &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Brussels%20metro%20and%20premetro%20stations\"&gt;important node&lt;/a&gt; of the Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company (&lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Intercommunal%20Transport%20Company\"&gt;STIB/MIVB&lt;/a&gt;).\nNaming.\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is &lt;a href=\"Multilingualism\"&gt;bilingual&lt;/a&gt;; hence, both the French and Dutch names of the station\u2014 and \u2014are official. Outside Belgium, this often leads to the use of combined shorthands; for example in the \"&lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Cook%20European%20Rail%20Timetable\"&gt;Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable&lt;/a&gt;\", Brussels-South is designated as \" /\"; &lt;a href=\"Nederlandse%20Spoorwegen\"&gt;NS&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch Railways) announce the station as \"Brussel Zuid/Midi\". The station was named after \"Le Midi\", the French name of the region of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20France\"&gt;Southern France&lt;/a&gt;, as trains departing from this station in the 19th century had that region as their final destination. The name , as the Dutch \"translation\" of , was only introduced after the &lt;a href=\"Coremans-De%20Vriendt%20law\"&gt;equality law of 1898&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFirst station (1839\u20131869).\nA first station known as Bogards' railway station (, ) had existed, since 1839, near the / in the southern part of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Brussels\"&gt;City of Brussels&lt;/a&gt;, so-called for the former cloister of the Bogards' convent whose site it was built on, and to which the / is nowadays the only reference. This station, which quickly took the name \"South Station\" (, ), served as the six-track terminus of the South Line, a southbound railway line linking Brussels to the industrial towns of &lt;a href=\"Mons\"&gt;Mons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charleroi\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"La%20Louvi%C3%A8re\"&gt;La Louvi\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;, at the heart of the \"&lt;a href=\"Sillon%20industriel\"&gt;Sillon industriel&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Hainaut%20Province\"&gt;Hainaut&lt;/a&gt;, Belgium, before crossing the French border (near &lt;a href=\"Qui%C3%A9vrain\"&gt;Qui\u00e9vrain&lt;/a&gt;), where a connecting line could reach &lt;a href=\"Valenciennes\"&gt;Valenciennes&lt;/a&gt;, in northern France. The former presence of a station at this location also explains the unusual width of the current /, which goes up from the Place Rouppe to Brussels' &lt;a href=\"Small%20Ring%2C%20Brussels\"&gt;small ring road&lt;/a&gt;, a reminder of the train tracks that used to run in its middle.\nSecond station (1869\u20131949).\nThe Belgian railway network grew rapidly during the second half of the 19th century, becoming the densest in &lt;a href=\"continental%20Europe\"&gt;continental Europe&lt;/a&gt;. By then, &lt;a href=\"Brussels-North%20railway%20station\"&gt;Brussels-North&lt;/a&gt; and Brussels-South had become the primary railway stations in Brussels (Brussels-North slowly supplanted the original / railway station near the same site). However, they were joined only by an inadequate single track running along what is today the route of the inner ring road. Many proposals were put forward to link the two stations more substantially. A law was finally passed in 1909 mandating a &lt;a href=\"North%E2%80%93South%20connection\"&gt;direct connection&lt;/a&gt;; however, the final project would not be completed until more than a century later.\nAround 1860, the South Station had reached saturation point and its location too close to the city centre began to cause problems, so the authorities decided to demolish it. A new monumental station, designed by the architect &lt;a href=\"Auguste%20Payen\"&gt;Auguste Payen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Neoclassical%20architecture%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;neoclassical&lt;/a&gt; style, opened in 1869, a short distance south from the original site, on the territory of the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Saint-Gilles%2C%20Belgium\"&gt;Saint-Gilles/Sint-Gillis&lt;/a&gt;. The entrance was shaped like a &lt;a href=\"triumphal%20arch\"&gt;triumphal arch&lt;/a&gt;, richly decorated with sculptures by Joseph Ducaju. In 1880, an &lt;a href=\"allegory\"&gt;allegorical&lt;/a&gt; statue of &lt;a href=\"Nike%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20mythology\"&gt;Greek goddess&lt;/a&gt; of victory riding a chariot, by the sculptor &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Samain\"&gt;Louis Samain&lt;/a&gt;, was placed on the roof of the station as a tribute to railway engineering. In front of the station, a large public square, known as the / (\"Constitution Square\"), was created, acting as an entry to the city for its many &lt;a href=\"commuter\"&gt;commuter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCurrent station (1949\u2013present).\nPayen's terminal station was itself demolished in 1949, as part of the &lt;a href=\"North%E2%80%93South%20connection\"&gt;North\u2013South connection&lt;/a&gt; project, and replaced by a transit station on its present site along the &lt;a href=\"Avenue%20Fonsny\"&gt;Avenue Fonsny/Fonsnylaan&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the current buildings were erected between 1939 and 1954, in post-war &lt;a href=\"Functionalism%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;functionalist&lt;/a&gt; style, from plans by architects Adrien and Yvan Blomme and Fernand Petit. Work on the connection also led to the station's immediate surroundings to be reorganised. The railway tracks were raised and extended unto a &lt;a href=\"viaduct\"&gt;viaduct&lt;/a&gt; towards the city centre, with shops under it and a covered street; the / (formerly the /), along which trams run. \nSince the 1990s, the South Station and the district adjacent to it have undergone profound transformation. The rear part of the station, designed in 1992 by the architect Marc De Vreese, and built in front of the /, serves as a terminal for &lt;a href=\"High-speed%20rail\"&gt;high-speed train&lt;/a&gt;s. On Saint-Gilles' side, expropriation plans have led, since 2012, to the creation of modern office blocks constituting a &lt;a href=\"Tertiary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy\"&gt;tertiary economic sector&lt;/a&gt; along the Avenue Fonsny, as well as extensions of the station along the /, the two arteries that surround the station. This business centre located a stone's throw from the city centre, is intended, in the spirit of the public authorities, to mirror the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Quarter%2C%20Brussels\"&gt;Northern Quarter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"central%20business%20district\"&gt;business district&lt;/a&gt; (also called \"Little Manhattan\"), located near the North Station, on the opposite side of the city centre.\nFeatures.\nThe station is surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"Avenue%20Fonsny\"&gt;Avenue Fonsny/Fonsnylaan&lt;/a&gt; to the east, the / to the west, the / to the north and the / to the south. In the 1990s, the &lt;a href=\"Eurostar\"&gt;Eurostar&lt;/a&gt; terminal was added on the Rue de France's side. This part contains two bay platforms with no onward northbound connection.\nA tripartite agreement was signed by Belgium, France and the UK on 15 May 1993, which permitted British officials to carry out pre-embarkation immigration controls for passengers travelling on direct &lt;a href=\"Eurostar\"&gt;Eurostar&lt;/a&gt; train services from Brussels to London and Belgian officials to carry out pre-embarkation immigration controls at &lt;a href=\"Waterloo%20International%20railway%20station\"&gt;London Waterloo International&lt;/a&gt; station for passengers travelling in the other direction. As a result of this agreement, &lt;a href=\"juxtaposed%20controls\"&gt;juxtaposed controls&lt;/a&gt; were set up in the station. On 1 October 2004, an administrative arrangement was signed by Belgium, France and the UK to extend juxtaposed controls to Eurostar services between London and Brussels which make a stop in Lille.\nEurostar passengers travelling to the UK clear exit checks from the &lt;a href=\"Schengen%20Area\"&gt;Schengen Area&lt;/a&gt; (carried out by the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20Federal%20Police\"&gt;Belgian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt;) as well as UK entry checks (conducted by the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Border%20Force\"&gt;UK Border Force&lt;/a&gt;) in the station before boarding their train. On the other hand, Eurostar passengers travelling to &lt;a href=\"Gare%20de%20Lille%20Europe\"&gt;Lille Europe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gare%20de%20Calais-Fr%C3%A9thun\"&gt;Calais-Fr\u00e9thun&lt;/a&gt; remain within the Schengen Area and are therefore not subject to border checks. Accordingly, they go through a different departure area in the station (bypassing the juxtaposed controls for passengers heading to the UK) and travel in a separate designated coach (available in standard class only) controlled by security guards, who ensure that all of these passengers disembark at Lille/Calais before the train continues to the UK.\nTrain services.\nThe station is served by the following services:\nMetro and \"premetro\" station.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20metro\"&gt;metro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Brussels%20metro%20and%20premetro%20stations\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt;, called /, opened on 2 October 1988 as (at that time) the terminus of metro line 2 from &lt;a href=\"Simonis%20metro%20station\"&gt;Simonis&lt;/a&gt;. Line 2 has since been extended beyond Brussels-South to &lt;a href=\"Clemenceau%20metro%20station\"&gt;Clemenceau&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, &lt;a href=\"Delacroix%20metro%20station\"&gt;Delacroix&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, and &lt;a href=\"Brussels-West%20station\"&gt;Gare de l'Ouest/Weststation&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. Since 1993, the station also accommodates &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20premetro\"&gt;\"premetro\"&lt;/a&gt; (underground tram) services at separate platforms, with &lt;a href=\"cross-platform%20interchange\"&gt;cross-platform interchange&lt;/a&gt; between metro and \"premetro\" in both directions.\nConnections.\nOuibus.\nSince 23 July 2012, &lt;a href=\"SNCF\"&gt;SNCF&lt;/a&gt;'s international coach network, &lt;a href=\"OUIBUS\"&gt;OUIBUS&lt;/a&gt;, has served Brussels-South.\nOther bus services.\nA shuttle service to &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20South%20Charleroi%20Airport\"&gt;Brussels South Charleroi Airport&lt;/a&gt; leaves from a stop located on the /.\nPlaces of interest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"South%20Tower%20%28Brussels%29\"&gt;South Tower&lt;/a&gt;, the tallest building in Belgium, stands in front of the station's main exit (the crossroad of the &lt;a href=\"Avenue%20Fonsny\"&gt;Avenue Fonsny/Fonsnylaan&lt;/a&gt; and the /) and houses the Belgian Federal Pensions Service (FPS)."
