Nicky Robinson speaks &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; fluently.\nNick was one of European rugby's leading fly-halves and he has amassed nearly 1,500 points to date in club rugby for his four professional sides - Cardiff Blues, Gloucester, Wasps &amp; Bristol.\nA left-footed fly-half, Nick was famous for his exciting running game.\nIn May 2009 he joined &lt;a href=\"Gloucester%20Rugby\"&gt;Gloucester Rugby&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20Blues\"&gt;Cardiff Blues&lt;/a&gt; on a three-year contract. He played a central role as Cardiff Blues thrashed Gloucester in the Anglo-Welsh Cup Final at Twickenham earlier that year.\nIn his two seasons at Gloucester Nick was a model of consistency for the English Premiership side, making 60 appearances and scoring in excess of 500 points as Gloucester reached the Anglo-Welsh Cup Final in 2010 (where they lost to Northampton Saints), the Anglo-Welsh Cup Final again in 2011 - where Nick was named man-of-the-match as Gloucester overcame Newcastle Falcons - and the Premiership play-off semi-finals, where a late try from Nick wasn't enough as Gloucester went down 12\u201310 to eventual winners Saracens.\nIn February 2011 it was announced he would be joining &lt;a href=\"Wasps%20RFC\"&gt;London Wasps&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Gloucester%20Rugby\"&gt;Gloucester Rugby&lt;/a&gt; on a two-year contract, teaming up again with former Cardiff Blues coach Dai Young.\nDespite 2011/2012 being a difficult season for Wasps off the field, on it Nick was a virtual ever-present in the starting line-up, scoring 230 points in 25 appearances as the club reached the quarter-finals of the European Challenge Cup.\nOn 21 February 2013, Robinson signed for &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rugby\"&gt;Bristol Rugby&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"RFU%20Championship\"&gt;RFU Championship&lt;/a&gt; and for the 2013\u201314 season.\nOn 29 January 2015, it was announced Robinson would join &lt;a href=\"Top%2014\"&gt;French Top 14&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Oyonnax%20Rugby\"&gt;Oyonnax&lt;/a&gt; on a three-year deal from the 2015\u201316 season.\nRobinson retired from playing in July 2016, but re-signed for Cardiff Blues in November of the same year.\nIn August 2017 it was announced that Robinson would remain at Cardiff Blues in a coaching capacity, taking on the role of kicking coach alongside former Blues scrum half Richie Rees, who would be working as backs coach.\nIn April 2018 Robinson married Lyndsey Dalglish the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Dalglish\"&gt;Kenny Dalglish&lt;/a&gt;."
