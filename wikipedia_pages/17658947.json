    "text": "The University of the Andes Library Services, officially known as SERBIULA (from the acronym in Spanish for \"Servicios Bibliotecarios de la Universidad de Los Andes\"), is the organization responsible for managing and directing all the different libraries of its parent institution, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20Andes%2C%20Venezuela\"&gt;University of the Andes&lt;/a&gt;, one of the main universities in &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe University of the Andes is not located in a single central campus, but in rather smaller campuses and branches; most of which are scattered across the &lt;a href=\"Andes\"&gt;andean&lt;/a&gt; and singularly university city of &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A9rida%2C%20M%C3%A9rida\"&gt;M\u00e9rida&lt;/a&gt;, while the others are located in different states of the country, with their respective library alongside.\nHistory.\nComing to life.\nBack in 1785, Bishop Juan Ramos de Lora, a Franciscan clergyman from &lt;a href=\"Seville\"&gt;Seville&lt;/a&gt;, opened a &lt;a href=\"Seminary\"&gt;Catholic seminary&lt;/a&gt; in M\u00e9rida, a remote village in the &lt;a href=\"Andes\"&gt;Andes mountains&lt;/a&gt; of what is now Venezuela, under &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20empire\"&gt;Spanish rule&lt;/a&gt; by then. Once the seminary opened, he gathered and collected many books for its library. It was initially composed of some salvaged antique books which dated back centuries, as far as the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Conquista&lt;/a&gt; times. It also included many \"oeuvres\" from his personal collection and some more from the collaborations and donations of priest friends, ministers and other prominent figures from his &lt;a href=\"Historical%20episcopate\"&gt;episcopate&lt;/a&gt;. Hence, the library's first books were comprehensive in canon law, civil law, medicine, philosophy and literature. Regarding the seminary, just a few years after it was founded, local authorities started lobbying to seek the grant of the &lt;a href=\"Bourbon%20Spain\"&gt;Spanish government&lt;/a&gt; to establish it as a &lt;a href=\"university\"&gt;university&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"university%20charter\"&gt;university charter&lt;/a&gt; was granted in 1806, but due to the bellicose period in the region it was only validated in 1810 thus the seminary became known as the \"Real Universidad de San Buenaventura de M\u00e9rida\" (Saint Bonaventure Royal University of M\u00e9rida), short before the &lt;a href=\"Venezuelan%20Declaration%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Venezuelan Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. The library slowly but steadily followed the evolution of its sheltering University.\nEstablishment of the University Library.\nMost of Venezuela's 19th century was a troublesome period. It was characterized by political turmoil, autocratic rule and consistent \"&lt;a href=\"coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;coups d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;\" which more often than not hindered the evolution of the academia in the country. Nevertheless, in the last decades of the century a steady political stability became foreseeable. In 1883 the Venezuelan government decided to review the law on the \"higher and scientific national education\", in which the country's two existing universities at the time were renamed with their contemporary name; i.e. \"Universidad de Los Andes\" for the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20Andes%2C%20Venezuela\"&gt;University of the Andes&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Universidad Central de Venezuela\" for the &lt;a href=\"Central%20University%20of%20Venezuela\"&gt;Central University of Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; in Caracas.\nWith the change of name and policies came a wave of institutional revampment. So, on August 1, 1888 the then &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20%28education%29\"&gt;Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; of the University, Dr. Caracciolo Parra, issued a decree ordaining the following:\nThe University Library was at last inaugurated on October 27, 1889. By the end of 1894 the Library was counting 1,436 titles and 1,725 volumes. By the turn of the 20th century these figures had bloomed to 2,120 and 2,572 respectively.\nWell into the 1900s (decade), the University Library was not any longer the sole library of the institution. Thence it began to be known as the Central Library. It espoused the responsibility of organizing the libraries of the different faculties of the university as they came to existence, and likewise for the training their corresponding personnel. Furthermore, it also conducted the acquisition of all the new resources and equipment for all of the faculty libraries. However, it was the responsibility of every faculty to fund their operation and administration.\nThe Coming of Age of SERBIULA.\nIn 1977 the libraries of the faculties of &lt;a href=\"Natural%20science\"&gt;Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Economics\"&gt;Economic Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, all three located within the same campus, were merged into the \"Integrated Library of Sciences, Economics and Engineering\" (\"BIECI\" for its acronym in Spanish). This was the first unification of different library services that took place within the University. A project proposal for taking this initiative to a higher level was put forth the &lt;a href=\"University%20Council\"&gt;University Council&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years later. The project submitted the comprehensive integration of all the university's library services into a greater single one. It was swiftly approved on March 6, 1980 and the resulting body was simply named University of Los Andes Library Services (\"SERBIULA\"). SERBIULA had and still has the responsibility of integrating all the existing library services and keeping them up-to-date with the University demands. Additionally, SERBIULA created and manages the university's &lt;a href=\"Integrated%20library%20system\"&gt;Library System&lt;/a&gt;, whose coordination follows a decentralized approach as a consequence of having the University campuses scattered all around the city. Another goal is improving the efficiency of human, technical and financial resources.\nAutomation of library services with SERBIULA.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Library%20automation%23History\"&gt;automation&lt;/a&gt; of library services in the University began with the creation of the aforementioned \"BIECI\" library\u2014currently renamed \"BIACI\", but more specifically with the launch of its &lt;a href=\"Information%20communication%20technology\"&gt;ICT&lt;/a&gt; department (simply known as \"Inform\u00e1tica\"). The broad purpose of this department was and still is to imprint ever more efficient, functional, and modern &lt;a href=\"Information%20retrieval\"&gt;Information retrieval&lt;/a&gt; processes to the library services. The early stages of this scheme began with the instalment of the following systems:\nThis early instalment was followed by the development of some middle-stage projects. These projects definitively ignited and set the pace for the continuous ICT updating and upgrading trend for the SERBIULA library services. Among these, the more important were:\nThis accumulated know-how resulted in the creation of the \"ULA Information and &lt;a href=\"Documentation\"&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt; System\" (SIDULA). It was originally designed to be a comprehensive library management system that would physically centralize all the acquisitions, cataloguing and loans. With the evolution in the University networks, it was ultimately redesigned to work as a &lt;a href=\"client%E2%80%93server%20model\"&gt;client\u2013server system&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresent-day SERBIULA.\nSERBIULA aims at improving and optimizing all library-related services. In 2000 it established the university's \"Electronic Information Services\" (SIE). In 2003 there were two major additions: the creation of the university's &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Library\"&gt;Digital Library&lt;/a&gt; (\"Biblioteca Digital\"), one of the university's main responsible organizations for the &lt;a href=\"Open%20access%20publishing\"&gt;on-line dissemination&lt;/a&gt; of its historical, cultural, audiovisual, and scientific-academic heritage and production. And secondly, the incorporation to the later of the \"Index for Venezuelan Science and Technology Journals\" (&lt;a href=\"REVENCYT\"&gt;REVENCYT&lt;/a&gt;) under the &lt;a href=\"Scielo\"&gt;SciELO&lt;/a&gt; platform.\n2005 witnessed the development of the open stack library \u2013somehow a novelty in these latitudes, as well as major physical and virtual revamping and upgrading of the whole library network. It was also the year in which SERBIULA embraced LIBRUM as its main library management system. LIBRUM is a locally developed &lt;a href=\"GNU%20General%20Public%20License\"&gt;GNU/GPL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"OPAC\"&gt;OPAC&lt;/a&gt; management software that handles cataloguing, item circulation, acquisitions, statistics, user administration, thesaurus and full-text e-publication; most notably under the &lt;a href=\"Open%20Archives%20Initiative%20Protocol%20for%20Metadata%20Harvesting\"&gt;OAI-PMH&lt;/a&gt; protocol.\nIn 2006 the ULA arose as the first Venezuelan organization ever to become (alongside three other Latin American organizations) signatory to the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Declaration%20on%20Open%20Access%20to%20Knowledge%20in%20the%20Sciences%20and%20Humanities\"&gt;2003 Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities&lt;/a&gt;. This initiative pertains to the online open access of the scientific production of the institution (the ULA for this particular case), thus giving \"Biblioteca Digital\" a new job cut up for itself.\nStill under process, the other ULA e-services and projects managed by \"Biblioteca Digital-SERBIULA\" are:\nNationwide recognition presented itself in 2007 under the National Book Award, for the Library Service category.\nIn June 2008, SERBIULA alongside other branch offices of the university, organized the workshop \"REVENCYT-Redalyc, Taller bi-nacional de Editores de Revistas Cient\u00edficas Venezolanas\", with two main purposes:\nUniversity of the Andes Libraries.\nWithin the different \"campi\" in M\u00e9rida \nULA Libraries in other Venezuelan cities and states "
