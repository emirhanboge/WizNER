    "text": "Gherman V. P\u00e2ntea (; surname also spelled P\u00eentea; , \"German Vasilievich Pyntya\"; , \"Herman Vasilyovich Pyntya\" or \"Pintia\"; May 13, 1894 \u2013 February 1, 1968) was a &lt;a href=\"Bessarabia\"&gt;Bessarabia&lt;/a&gt;n-born soldier, civil servant and political figure, active in the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. As an officer of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russian%20Army\"&gt;Imperial Russian Army&lt;/a&gt; during most of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, he helped organize the committees of Bessarabian soldiers, oscillating between loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Provisional%20Government\"&gt;Russian Provisional Government&lt;/a&gt; and the cause of Bessarabian emancipation. P\u00e2ntea was subsequently Military Director of the &lt;a href=\"Moldavian%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;Moldavian Democratic Republic&lt;/a&gt;, answering to &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Moldova\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Incule%C8%9B\"&gt;Ion Incule\u021b&lt;/a&gt;. He personally created a &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Moldova\"&gt;Bessarabian defense force&lt;/a&gt;, tasked with combating &lt;a href=\"Bolshevik\"&gt;Bolshevik&lt;/a&gt; subversion and Russian intimidation, but also braced for defeat after the &lt;a href=\"October%20Revolution\"&gt;October Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith some hesitance, Gherman P\u00e2ntea endorsed the Republic's &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Bessarabia%20with%20Romania\"&gt;union with Romania&lt;/a&gt;, affiliating with the local &lt;a href=\"Bessarabian%20Peasants%27%20Party\"&gt;Bessarabian Peasants' Party&lt;/a&gt;, then with Romania's &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201875%29\"&gt;National Liberals&lt;/a&gt;. Having parallel careers as teacher, lawyer and journalist, P\u00e2ntea remained a presence in Romanian political life, as member of &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, negotiator of &lt;a href=\"d%C3%A9tente\"&gt;d\u00e9tente&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, and three times &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u\"&gt;Mayor of Chi\u0219in\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;. He was however mistrusted for his defense of arrested Bolsheviks, his critique of &lt;a href=\"centralized%20government\"&gt;centralized government&lt;/a&gt;, and his alleged corruption. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, P\u00e2ntea was &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Odessa\"&gt;Mayor of Odessa&lt;/a&gt; under a Romanian occupation. He intervened to save Jews from the &lt;a href=\"1941%20Odessa%20massacre\"&gt;1941 Odessa massacre&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent deportations to camps in &lt;a href=\"Transnistria%20Governorate\"&gt;Transnistria&lt;/a&gt;. He had a tumultuous relationship with &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Antonescu\"&gt;Ion Antonescu&lt;/a&gt;, the Romanian dictator, and was kept in check by the occupation authority. His administration managed to set in motion a plan for &lt;a href=\"Odessa\"&gt;Odessa&lt;/a&gt;, and helped the city overcome devastation through the adoption of &lt;a href=\"free%20trade\"&gt;free trade&lt;/a&gt;, but also created various controversies.\nP\u00e2ntea was long suspected of war crimes, and spent much of his post-war life as a fugitive. He was eventually apprehended, and became a &lt;a href=\"political%20prisoner\"&gt;political prisoner&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian communist regime&lt;/a&gt;. In 1956, he managed to have the war crimes verdict overturned but, albeit &lt;a href=\"Rehabilitation%20%28Soviet%29\"&gt;rehabilitated&lt;/a&gt; in part, continued to be harassed by the communist apparatus until the 1960s.\nBiography.\nEarly years and World War I service.\nMuch of Gherman P\u00e2ntea's life remain mysterious, inaccessible to researchers, and, according to historian Ion Constantin, \"a permanent crossover of myth and reality.\" Of &lt;a href=\"Romanians\"&gt;ethnic Romanian&lt;/a&gt; and lower-middle-class origins, Gherman P\u00e2ntea was born on May 13, 1894, in the northern Bessarabian village of &lt;a href=\"Z%C4%83icani\"&gt;Z\u0103icani&lt;/a&gt;; he was one of several children born to lawyer Vasile P\u00e2ntea and his wife Ioana. They were of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; religion, and Gherman was a practicing &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Romanian Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; until late in life. The boy had trouble adapting himself to the requirements of living in what was then Russia's &lt;a href=\"Bessarabia%20Governorate\"&gt;Bessarabia Governorate&lt;/a&gt;: although he was studious and completed primary school with honors, he had difficulty learning the official &lt;a href=\"Russian%20language\"&gt;Russian language&lt;/a&gt;. He finished secondary school in &lt;a href=\"Glodeni\"&gt;Glodeni&lt;/a&gt;, before leaving for &lt;a href=\"Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi\"&gt;Akkerman&lt;/a&gt;, where he attended Russian &lt;a href=\"normal%20school\"&gt;normal school&lt;/a&gt; and witnessed the start of World War I. He frequently sailed to Odessa, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; port which was to fascinate him for the rest of his life.\nIn June 1915, shortly after completing his studies, P\u00e2ntea was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army, and relocated to &lt;a href=\"Kiev\"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt;, where he attended a &lt;a href=\"Junker%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Junker School&lt;/a&gt;. He was again in Odessa, where Bessarabian-born officer &lt;a href=\"Emanoil%20Catelli\"&gt;Emanoil Catelli&lt;/a&gt; was giving standard &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian language&lt;/a&gt; classes to Russian officers, and became close friends with his new teacher. (Some sources represent P\u00e2ntea as a graduate of &lt;a href=\"Odessa%20University\"&gt;Odessa University&lt;/a&gt;.) Upon graduation from the Junker School, the young \"&lt;a href=\"Podporuchik\"&gt;Podporuchik&lt;/a&gt;\" was dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Romania%20in%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Romanian front&lt;/a&gt;, to function as a translator between the &lt;a href=\"Ninth%20Army%20%28Russian%20Empire%29\"&gt;Russian Ninth Army&lt;/a&gt; and their colleagues in the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Land%20Forces\"&gt;Romanian Land Forces&lt;/a&gt;. He also fought with valor during battles against the &lt;a href=\"German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29\"&gt;German Army&lt;/a&gt;, and twice received the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20St.%20George\"&gt;Order of St. George&lt;/a&gt;.\nRussia's &lt;a href=\"February%20Revolution\"&gt;February Revolution&lt;/a&gt; caught P\u00e2ntea entrenched with his men somewhere near the town of &lt;a href=\"Roman%2C%20Romania\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;. The news, he later wrote, was a wake-up call for the Bessarabian Romanians in foreign lands, since it offered the prospect of self-determination at home. As the Provisional Government took hold of military matters, P\u00e2ntea became President of the Ninth Army's &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20%28council%29\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt;, and also helped organize the Bessarabian soldiers into a single political body. Similar actions were being taken by other nationally minded Bessarabian officers. Some\u2014Catelli, &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Crihan\"&gt;Anton Crihan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Osoianu\"&gt;Constantin Osoianu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ion%20P%C4%83sc%C4%83lu%C8%9B%C4%83\"&gt;Ion P\u0103sc\u0103lu\u021b\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Scobioal%C4%83\"&gt;Andrei Scobioal\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were active on Bessarabia's borders, while others addressed Bessarabian units in places such as &lt;a href=\"Novorossiya\"&gt;Novorossiya&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Elefterie%20Sinicliu\"&gt;Elefterie Sinicliu&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"Crimea\"&gt;Crimea&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Grigore%20Turcuman\"&gt;Grigore Turcuman&lt;/a&gt;).\nHere was the nucleus for a single military and political unit of the Bessarabian, or \"Moldavian\", national movement, which sought to gain control of &lt;a href=\"Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u\"&gt;Chi\u0219in\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; (the informal Bessarabian capital). At the time, tensions were sparked between \"Podporuchik\" P\u00e2ntea's Roman organization and the inner-Bessarabian faction which demanded a &lt;a href=\"social%20revolution\"&gt;social revolution&lt;/a&gt;, namely the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Soviet of Workers and Soldiers; he also had to struggle with Bessarabian apathy, &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; gains, and territorial claims stated by the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20People%27s%20Republic\"&gt;Ukrainian People's Republic&lt;/a&gt;. Through P\u00e2ntea and Scobioal\u0103, the Roman group communicated directly with a civilian network formed by the Bessarabian expatriates of &lt;a href=\"Ia%C8%99i\"&gt;Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt;, who endorsed the effort to consolidate political unity. On behalf of the Roman leadership, P\u00e2ntea made a journey to Odessa, where he contacted the eastern committee formed by Catelli and the others (May 1917). At the time, Odessa Bessarabians were forming their \"Moldavian &lt;a href=\"Cohort%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;Cohorts&lt;/a&gt;\", armed units which were supposed to challenge the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Soviet.\nMoldavian Central Committee.\nEventually, in June 1917, Gherman P\u00e2ntea and two other Ninth Army soldiers\u2014Petre V\u0103rzaru, Ion Mitrean\u2014were mandated by their colleagues to leave for Chi\u0219in\u0103u and organize the national movement locally. The youngest of all activists involved in the project, P\u00e2ntea was elected head of the resulting Moldavian Central Committee of the Soldiers and Officers' Union. P\u00e2ntea, V\u0103rzaru and Mitrean benefited from some Russian support, after Commander &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Shcherbachov\"&gt;Alexander Shcherbachov&lt;/a&gt; gave them a free pass and an indefinite leave from the Romanian front. However, their Central Committee met a new rival in the parallel &lt;a href=\"Military%20Revolutionary%20Committee\"&gt;Military Revolutionary Committee&lt;/a&gt;, formed by revolutionary Russians loyal to the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Soviet. This authority gave formal backing to its Moldavian equivalent, supporting its struggle for self-determination and even discussing a merger, but discreetly tried to combat Bessarabian Romanian influence in all other fields. A truce was agreed upon between P\u00e2ntea and the Russian Committee representative Levenzon, which even allowed both organisms to share office space in the same building.\nDuring September, after clashes with some of the radicalized peasants hampered propaganda efforts in the countryside, and Ukrainian or Russian pressures increased, the Moldavian Committee began issuing its own political newspaper. Known as \"Soldatul Moldovan\" (\"The Moldavian Soldier\"), it had poet &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Tudor\"&gt;Gheorghe (Iorgu) Tudor&lt;/a&gt; as manager and P\u00e2ntea as one of three editors. P\u00e2ntea carried from Ia\u0219i a large bag of propaganda literature, in &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Cyrillic%20alphabet\"&gt;Cyrillic letters&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Harea\"&gt;Vasile Harea&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Cuv%C3%A2nt%20Moldovenesc%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Cuv\u00e2nt Moldovenesc&lt;/a&gt;\" paper, who witnessed the event, described P\u00e2ntea as \"a rather affected young man, with a nervous gaze, ambitious and conceiving of all sorts of schemes\".\nAt around the same time, the Moldavian Central Committee took steps to create a Bessarabian national force within Russia's Army, with &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Cijevschi\"&gt;Vasile Cijevschi&lt;/a&gt; as Commander. The request was presented to the \"&lt;a href=\"Stavka\"&gt;Stavka&lt;/a&gt;\" (supreme command of the Russian forces) in &lt;a href=\"Mogilev\"&gt;Mogilev&lt;/a&gt;. It provided an ambiguous response, and P\u00e2ntea led a delegation to request further clarification. On their way through Kiev, the Bessarabian envoys chanced upon Romania's own delegates to Russia: &lt;a href=\"Dinu%20Br%C4%83tianu\"&gt;Dinu Br\u0103tianu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Iancovescu\"&gt;Constantin Iancovescu&lt;/a&gt;. The two missions shared a train carriage, and the time they shared prompted \"Stavka\" staff to suspect a conspiracy. The Bessarabians tried to mend the situation, and P\u00e2ntea had interviews with Commander &lt;a href=\"Nikolay%20Dukhonin\"&gt;Nikolay Dukhonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Russian Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Kerensky\"&gt;Alexander Kerensky&lt;/a&gt;. P\u00e2ntea later wrote that Kerensky was the most welcoming, allowing the gradual creation of a single Bessarabian army (and even promising to transfer the Odessa 40th Regiment its jurisdiction), but forbidding any unilateral Bessarabian decision on this matter.\nBefore and after the &lt;a href=\"October%20Revolution\"&gt;October Revolution&lt;/a&gt; overturned the Provisional Government and brought the &lt;a href=\"Bolshevik\"&gt;Bolshevik&lt;/a&gt; (communist) movement to power in Russia, Gherman P\u00e2ntea played a game of intricate diplomacy. According to Ion Constantin, he was good at seizing political opportunities \"in those murky, troubled times, subject to fast and radical changes to the map of &lt;a href=\"East-Central%20Europe\"&gt;East-Central Europe&lt;/a&gt;\". By early October 1917, P\u00e2ntea was realizing that Kerensky and the Provisional Government could lose the battle. In a bid to discover the other side's intentions regarding Bessarabia, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Petrograd\"&gt;Petrograd&lt;/a&gt; and met Bolshevik ideologue &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Lenin\"&gt;Vladimir Lenin&lt;/a&gt;. As P\u00e2ntea later stated, Lenin declared himself for revolutionary self-determination in the national issue\u2014some researchers regard this claim as an urban legend, with which Bessarabian intellectuals tried to convince communists that Lenin himself validated their national aspirations. Returning to Bessarabia, P\u00e2ntea attended meetings of the Bolshevik club, alongside &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Buzdugan\"&gt;Ion Buzdugan&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\" and Moldavian Directorate.\nMeanwhile, P\u00e2ntea's Committee organized a Moldavian Soldiers' Congress, which was to form the basis for a Bessarabian legislature, called \"&lt;a href=\"Sfatul%20%C8%9A%C4%83rii\"&gt;Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii&lt;/a&gt;\". A dispute endures surrounding the initiative behind this Congress, since both P\u00e2ntea and &lt;a href=\"%C8%98tefan%20Holban\"&gt;\u0218tefan Holban&lt;/a&gt; claimed to have had the idea first. In order to ensure attendance, P\u00e2ntea (or Holban) appealed to a ruse, circulating a telegram which misleadingly suggested that the Russian Provisional Government was backing the Congress. Within days, P\u00e2ntea was designated Vice President of the Bessarabian soldiers' assembly; Cijevschi was its President.\nTheir act of insubordination enraged Kerensky: just before Lenin ousted him from power, the Russian Prime Minister issued a warrant for P\u00e2ntea's arrest; by then, however, the Bessarabian Congress had been recognized by third parties, from the &lt;a href=\"Menshevik\"&gt;Menshevik&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"General%20Jewish%20Labour%20Bund%20in%20Lithuania%2C%20Poland%20and%20Russia\"&gt;Bundistn&lt;/a&gt;. In the confusion that followed Lenin's seizure of power, P\u00e2ntea still recognized the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Constituent%20Assembly\"&gt;Russian Constituent Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, and presented his candidature in the &lt;a href=\"1917%20Russian%20Constituent%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;Russian parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt;. He was included on a &lt;a href=\"Bessarabian%20Peasants%27%20Party\"&gt;Bessarabian Peasants' Party&lt;/a&gt; (P\u021aB) list headed by &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Incule%C8%9B\"&gt;Ion Incule\u021b&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pantelimon%20Erhan\"&gt;Pantelimon Erhan&lt;/a&gt;. The election itself was a chaotic affair, and votes were never officially counted anywhere in Bessarabia.\nOnce \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\" came into existence, P\u00e2ntea was involved in more political maneuvering, helping his colleagues to topple &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Pelivan\"&gt;Ion Pelivan&lt;/a&gt;, the designated first President of the Assembly. In doing so, P\u00e2ntea gave approval to the demands of non-Romanian or pro-Russian delegates, who were scandalized by Pelivan's vocal Romanian nationalism. Like Crihan and Buzdugan, and eventually Pelivan himself, he transferred his support to Incule\u021b, who was widely perceived as a moderate, a loyalist, and a product of the February Revolution. P\u00e2ntea too was designated a \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\" member, representing both the Soldiers' Congress and a &lt;a href=\"B%C4%83l%C8%9Bi%20Country\"&gt;B\u0103l\u021bi Country&lt;/a&gt; constituency. His first address, in Russian, spoke about the opportunity for reform, and promised that, under \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\", Bessarabia would bloom into \"a rose\". P\u00e2ntea was then an active as legislator, serving on the \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\" Commission for Schooling and the Commission for &lt;a href=\"Liquidation\"&gt;Liquidation&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, he was a delegate to the Congress of Schoolteachers, wherein he recommended teaching Romanian to all Bessarabian schoolchildren. From 1918 to 1925, he edited the Russian-language regional daily \"Golos\".\nWhen Bessarabian deputies created the autonomous &lt;a href=\"Moldavian%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;Moldavian Democratic Republic&lt;/a&gt;, P\u00e2ntea was integrated on the governing Moldavian Directorate: he had in his care the General Directorate for War and Navy, initially as \"&lt;a href=\"Locum\"&gt;Locum&lt;/a&gt;\" for &lt;a href=\"Teodor%20Cojocaru\"&gt;Teodor Cojocaru&lt;/a&gt;, and then as \"de facto\" Director. His main task was the creation of a &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Moldova\"&gt;\"Moldavian\" armed force&lt;/a&gt;, which integrated the previous Cohorts, guarded over the unruly withdrawal of Russian forces, and established friendly contacts with the &lt;a href=\"French%20Army\"&gt;French Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Director witnessed with growing alarm as some components of his new army were coming under Bolshevik influence. Such was the case of Chi\u0219in\u0103u Garrison, which was being maneuvered by &lt;a href=\"Ilie%20C%C4%83t%C4%83r%C4%83u\"&gt;Ilie C\u0103t\u0103r\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious adventurer and political radical. After C\u0103t\u0103r\u0103u openly questioned \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\" authority over his troops, P\u00e2ntea took a singular measure: together with a rogue unit of &lt;a href=\"Amur%20Cossacks\"&gt;Amur Cossacks&lt;/a&gt;, he surprised C\u0103t\u0103r\u0103u on New Year's Eve, arresting and deporting him into the Ukraine. Between the two distinct phases of this incident, the Republic's army was sworn in during a ceremony attended by &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Moldova\"&gt;Moldavian President&lt;/a&gt; Incule\u021b.\nUnion with Romania.\nBolshevik agitation, endorsed from a distance by Lenin's &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Russian Soviet Republic&lt;/a&gt;, peaked over the early days of 1918. The withdrawing Russians were sacking the region, and Bolshevik factions such as \"Front-Ordel\" stood to gain the upper hand in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, &lt;a href=\"Cotiujeni\"&gt;Cotiujeni&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Budjak\"&gt;Budjak&lt;/a&gt;. P\u00e2ntea instituted a &lt;a href=\"state%20of%20emergency\"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt;, and attempted to introduce more severe sanctions for insubordination. The Bolshevik groups resorted to intimidating acts in the capital, kidnapping some of the \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\" deputies and attacking the Romanian-organized &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Volunteer%20Corps%20in%20Russia\"&gt;Volunteer Corps in Russia&lt;/a&gt;. In his addresses to \"Sfatul\", P\u00e2ntea began identifying the Republic's enemy as exclusively \"non-Moldavian\", but noted that the Bessarabian army behaved \"like a flock of rams\", with no leadership and morale. On January 9, 1918, the Director was himself a victim of a Bolshevik maneuver, being apprehended by \"Front-Ordel\" men and only released, together with soldiers of the Volunteer Corps, when the Bessarabian army intervened in force.\nFacing the threats of &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Russian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; expansion into the Republic and &lt;a href=\"communization\"&gt;communization&lt;/a&gt; in his own ranks, P\u00e2ntea became a major contributor to the accelerated political process of &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Bessarabia%20with%20Romania\"&gt;union with Romania&lt;/a&gt;. In January 1918, he welcomed the Romanian Land Forces and General &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Bro%C8%99teanu\"&gt;Ernest Bro\u0219teanu&lt;/a&gt;, who had a mandate to reinstate order, and who arrived in Chi\u0219in\u0103u alongside the French military envoy &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Mathias%20Berthelot\"&gt;Henri Mathias Berthelot&lt;/a&gt;. There followed a common offensive against the Bolshevik insurgents, part of the larger &lt;a href=\"Allied%20intervention%20in%20the%20Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Western intervention in the Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the Bolsheviks retreated to &lt;a href=\"Bender%2C%20Moldova\"&gt;Tighina&lt;/a&gt;, and the Russian Soviet government broke &lt;a href=\"Romania%E2%80%93Russia%20relations\"&gt;diplomatic contacts with Romania&lt;/a&gt; (\"see &lt;a href=\"Odessa%20Soviet%20Republic\"&gt;Odessa Soviet Republic&lt;/a&gt;\").\nLater that month, the Moldavian Republic proclaimed itself an independent state, with &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Ciugureanu\"&gt;Daniel Ciugureanu&lt;/a&gt; as the new head of government. The administration was reorganized, and P\u00e2ntea lost his position to Colonel &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Br%C4%83escu\"&gt;Constantin Br\u0103escu&lt;/a&gt;, the Minister of War. President Incule\u021b compensated for the loss of prestige, raising Gherman P\u00e2ntea to the rank of &lt;a href=\"Major\"&gt;Major&lt;/a&gt; and making him Knight of the Moldavian Order of St. Vladimir.\nBy then, Romanian intervention posed a fundamental dilemma, since the political class became undecided about whether to cement Bessarabian statehood or look forward to a union. Inconclusiveness touched the Bessarabian army. Its new uniforms, on the Romanian model, led Bessarabians to assume that it was a branch of the Romanian Land Forces; the &lt;a href=\"monogram\"&gt;monogram&lt;/a&gt; \"R.M.\", for \"Republica Moldoveneasc\u0103\" (\"Moldavian Republic\"), was commonly misread as standing for \"&lt;a href=\"Greater%20Romania\"&gt;Greater Romania&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Rom\u00e2nia Mare\"). P\u00e2ntea himself appeared undecided about the situation, and, in a letter to pro-Russian officer &lt;a href=\"Anatol%20Popa\"&gt;Anatol Popa&lt;/a&gt; (later &lt;a href=\"Capital%20punishment%20in%20Romania\"&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; by the Romanian military), argued: \"I promise you that I'll be defending republican Bessarabia next to Russia, even if it costs me my life [...]. I gave the order for all the Moldavian army to take action; when it turned out that the Romanians were arriving with too great a force, I changed that order. The Romanians hold on tight [...]. I fear greatly that the Romanians are here to steal away our Bessarabia.\"\nThis correspondence remains a problematic aspect of P\u00e2ntea' career. While some take it to imply double dealing or at least an ideological ambiguity, Ion Constantin suggests that it may have been in fact a ruse. At the time, Romanian authorities were less convinced of P\u00e2ntea's loyalty. They suspected him of playing the Romanians and the Russians against each other, and subjected him to a formal inquiry. Years later, P\u00e2ntea referred to Bro\u0219teanu's intervention as misguided and sanguinary, because it carried out &lt;a href=\"summary%20execution\"&gt;summary execution&lt;/a&gt;s of suspected rebels, encouraged denunciations, and stained the unionists' international reputation.\nThe union was effected on March 27, 1918, when a \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\" majority voted in favor. The 86 yea votes, which carried the day, included P\u00e2ntea's. He also voted in favor of a &lt;a href=\"Land%20reform%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian-wide land reform&lt;/a&gt;, an additional condition to the union. Contrary to later Bolshevik allegations, he and the other pro-union voters did not receive land property in exchange for their loyalty.\nLawyer, journalist and PNL politician.\nOver the following period, P\u00e2ntea campaigned internally for further recognition of the assembly's decision, approaching the reluctant communities of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea%20Germans\"&gt;Black Sea Germans&lt;/a&gt;. In March 1919, he was at &lt;a href=\"Tarutyne\"&gt;Tarutino&lt;/a&gt;, where a mass of Germans was persuaded into voting for the \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\" union resolution. He subsequently accompanied a deputation of Black Sea Germans to &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, capital of Greater Romania, and, with them, was received by &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Romania\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20I%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Ferdinand I&lt;/a&gt;. His rank in the Bessarabian army was recognized by the Romanian &lt;a href=\"military%20reserve%20force\"&gt;military reserve force&lt;/a&gt;, which integrated him as Major.\nIn April, P\u00e2ntea was promoted a member of the Central Committee of the P\u021aB, and Chairman of its Club. He was in Romania for a while, taking his license degree from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Ia%C8%99i\"&gt;University of Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt; Faculty of Law (September 1919). Later investigation into his career resulted in allegations that P\u00e2ntea never did attend class, and that his diploma was abusively released by Rector &lt;a href=\"A.%20C.%20Cuza\"&gt;A. C. Cuza&lt;/a&gt; (answering the special request of &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ion%20I.%20C.%20Br%C4%83tianu\"&gt;Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu&lt;/a&gt;). Whether or not this is true, P\u00e2ntea is known to have been enlisted with the Bessarabian &lt;a href=\"bar%20association\"&gt;bar association&lt;/a&gt; as of 1919. Late in the year, he began publishing another Russian-language daily, \"Bessarabia\", which went under in short while and was revived by &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20B%C3%A2rc%C4%83\"&gt;Vasile B\u00e2rc\u0103&lt;/a&gt; in 1923. This venture drew suspicions from the Romanian authorities, who organized a search of the premises and, reputedly, uncovered samples of communist propaganda.\nInside the P\u021aB, P\u00e2ntea was loyal to Incule\u021b, and fought against the factions headed by &lt;a href=\"Pan%20Halippa\"&gt;Pan Halippa&lt;/a&gt; and Pelivan. He edited the party's \"Basarabia\" newspaper, where he launched tirades against Halippa, and again rose to a leadership position after Halippa's expulsion. P\u00e2ntea followed Incule\u021b into Romania's &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201875%29\"&gt;National Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; (PNL), and became deputy leader of the group's Bessarabian section. This affiliation got him elected into the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian Assembly of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; (lower chamber of &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;), the first of ten consecutive terms. P\u00e2ntea was nevertheless considered suspect by the Romanian establishment, who believed him a man of left-wing sympathies and a promoter of communist literature. He was attorney for the group of Bessarabian communists, led by &lt;a href=\"Pavel%20Tcacenco\"&gt;Pavel Tcacenco&lt;/a&gt;, who had agitated against the Romanian state. The \"&lt;a href=\"pro%20bono\"&gt;pro bono&lt;/a&gt;\" activity was largely successful: Tcancenco and other three men were found guilt of sedition, and sentenced to death \"&lt;a href=\"trial%20in%20absentia\"&gt;in absentia&lt;/a&gt;\"; 65 detainees were acquitted; 39 others were set free after &lt;a href=\"trial%20de%20novo\"&gt;trial de novo&lt;/a&gt;. This implied placing himself against the PNL government, particularly since P\u00e2ntea reported to the world on the alleged the abuse of power by Romanian administrators in Bessarabia. His intervention in Parliament prompted the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Administration%20and%20Interior%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Interior Ministry&lt;/a&gt; (headed by &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20L.%20Lupu\"&gt;Nicolae L. Lupu&lt;/a&gt;) to sack the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Siguran%C8%9Ba%20Statului\"&gt;\"Siguran\u021ba\" police&lt;/a&gt; in Chi\u0219in\u0103u.\nIn 1922, from Tighina, Gherman P\u00e2ntea began issuing another Russian daily. Titled \"Yuzhnaya Bessarabia\" or \"Iujnaia Besarabia\" (\"Southern Bessarabia\"), it survived until April 1923. He first had a stint as &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u\"&gt;Mayor of Chi\u0219in\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;, beginning and ending in 1923, when he outlined plans to improve education and the urban landscape of peripheral quarters. In October 1923, he was elected one of four Vice Presidents of the Assembly of Deputies, the first of two such assignments he would receive in his career.\nDiplomatic missions and Georgist dissidence.\nIn summer 1923, mandated by &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Foreign Affairs Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ion%20G.%20Duca\"&gt;Ion G. Duca&lt;/a&gt; of the PNL, he played a part in negotiations to restore contacts with the Russian government. He was in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, meeting with the Romanian communist &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Rakovsky\"&gt;Christian Rakovsky&lt;/a&gt;, who was the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Ambassadors%20of%20Russia%20to%20France\"&gt;Soviet Ambassador to France&lt;/a&gt;. They discussed the litigious issue of Bessarabia, which the Bolsheviks still refused to recognize as part of Romania: P\u00e2ntea was supposed to convince them that the union had been a legitimate affair, and, according to P\u00e2ntea, Rakovsky showed himself unusually receptive. With a delegation which included &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Langa-R%C4%83%C8%99canu\"&gt;Constantin Langa-R\u0103\u0219canu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mircea%20Djuvara\"&gt;Mircea Djuvara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Petru%20Cazacu\"&gt;Petru Cazacu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Crihan\"&gt;Anton Crihan&lt;/a&gt;, P\u00e2ntea represented Romania in bilateral talks with a delegation from the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, headed by diplomat &lt;a href=\"Nikolay%20Krestinsky\"&gt;Nikolay Krestinsky&lt;/a&gt;. These negotiations took place in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; during late March 1924. In conversation with Krestinsky, P\u00e2ntea even transmitted the government's offer to renounce claims to the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Treasure\"&gt;Romanian Treasure&lt;/a&gt; in Russia, in exchange for the Soviet recognition of the 1918 union.\nContacts broke down when the Soviets presented their proposal: a &lt;a href=\"plebiscite\"&gt;plebiscite&lt;/a&gt; in the disputed region or, alternatively, Romania's cession of the &lt;a href=\"Budjak\"&gt;Budjak&lt;/a&gt;. P\u00e2ntea believed that their uncompromising stance showed the swift radicalization of Soviet foreign policy under new Bolshevik leader &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt;, who was Rakovsky's enemy. The same year, Tcacenco returned to Romania, instigating the \"&lt;a href=\"Tatarbunary%20Uprising\"&gt;Tatarbunary Uprising&lt;/a&gt;\". This rebellion was quashed by the Romanian authorities, and P\u00e2ntea was again defense attorney for the Bessarabian communist cell.\nP\u00e2ntea also received his second term as Vice President of the Assembly after the &lt;a href=\"1927%20Romanian%20general%20election\"&gt;1927 election&lt;/a&gt;. He still held the office in 1925, when he took part in debates to extend the scope of &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20emancipation\"&gt;Jewish emancipation&lt;/a&gt;. To the alarm of &lt;a href=\"Antisemitism\"&gt;antisemitic&lt;/a&gt; groups such as the &lt;a href=\"National-Christian%20Defense%20League\"&gt;National-Christian Defense League&lt;/a&gt;, he assessed that all &lt;a href=\"Bessarabian%20Jews\"&gt;Bessarabian Jews&lt;/a&gt; had the right of &lt;a href=\"naturalization\"&gt;naturalization&lt;/a&gt;. By then, the former Military Director was also a managerial director for Chi\u0219in\u0103u's &lt;a href=\"chamber%20of%20commerce\"&gt;chamber of commerce&lt;/a&gt;, and tried to obtain tax reductions for the Bessarabian artisans.\nGherman P\u00e2ntea returned as Mayor of Chi\u0219in\u0103u, in office from 1927 to 1928. In 1930, dissatisfied with the PNL and in dispute with Incule\u021b, he became a member of the dissident &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberal%20Party-Br%C4%83tianu\"&gt;National Liberal Party-Br\u0103tianu&lt;/a&gt; (the \"Georgists\"). He was notoriously critical of the PNL's party line, alleging that Incule\u021b had exploited Bessarabia for the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Old%20Kingdom\"&gt;Old Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s benefit. Around the same time as Bessarabia marked its first full decade of Romanian rule, P\u00e2ntea, Buzdugan, Crihan and Catelli were members of the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Union of Reserve Officers. A rough equivalent of the pre-union &lt;a href=\"Assembly%20of%20the%20Nobility\"&gt;Assembly of the Nobility&lt;/a&gt;, this association stood out for demanding equal access to Romanian pensions for veterans of the Bessarabian army.\nEarly 1930s.\nThe Georgist party failed to register much success, and P\u00e2ntea left it before the &lt;a href=\"1931%20Romanian%20general%20election\"&gt;1931 election&lt;/a&gt;; he joined the \"National Union\" list of incumbent Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Iorga\"&gt;Nicolae Iorga&lt;/a&gt;, and was returned to the lower chamber. His third and final mandate as Mayor of Chi\u0219in\u0103u was in 1932, when he began taking steps to erect a local statue of Ferdinand I. As the region suffered the consequences of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;, he helped Chi\u0219in\u0103u's poor, using public funds to buy back their &lt;a href=\"Pawnbroker\"&gt;pawned&lt;/a&gt; property items. As claimed by his political rivals (including historian &lt;a href=\"%C8%98tefan%20Ciobanu%20%28politician%29\"&gt;\u0218tefan Ciobanu&lt;/a&gt;), P\u00e2ntea was corrupt and irresponsible in office, pocketing large sums of public money, and partying at Chi\u0219in\u0103u's expense on a visit to &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861%E2%80%931946%29\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; (where he was supposed to reward &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Badoglio\"&gt;Pietro Badoglio&lt;/a&gt;'s support of the Bessarabian union). An anonymous brochure called the mayor a \"&lt;a href=\"Rasputin\"&gt;Rasputin&lt;/a&gt;\", alleging that he stole public furniture, while an antisemitic city councilor depicted him as \"in cahoots\" with the Bessarabian Jews.\nDuring those years, P\u00e2ntea also became an active member of the Bucharest Bessarabian Circle of &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Bosie-Codreanu\"&gt;Nicolae Bosie-Codreanu&lt;/a&gt;, which monitored the evolution of Soviet attitudes on Romania. By then, there was a visible &lt;a href=\"rapprochement\"&gt;rapprochement&lt;/a&gt; between the Romania and the Soviet Union, effected by Romania's Foreign Minister &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Titulescu\"&gt;Nicolae Titulescu&lt;/a&gt; and his PNL faction. The two governments had signed the &lt;a href=\"London%20Convention%20for%20the%20Definition%20of%20Aggression\"&gt;London Convention for the Definition of Aggression&lt;/a&gt; and resumed diplomatic contacts. Renewing his attempts to obtain a definitive Romanian\u2013Soviet agreement on Bessarabia, P\u00e2ntea had informal talks with &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Ostrovsky%20%28commissar%29\"&gt;Mikhail Ostrovsky&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Ambassador%20to%20Romania\"&gt;Soviet Envoy to Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. P\u00e2ntea preserved the image of a philo-Romanian Ostrovsky, who believed that Stalin would in time accept the union; the initiative, however, came to nothing, as both Ostrovsky and Titulescu were sidelined by their respective governments.\nP\u00e2ntea was also focusing on writing his memoirs of World War I and the union. Some of these texts were originally published by \"&lt;a href=\"Dreptatea\"&gt;Dreptatea&lt;/a&gt;\" daily in 1931, and were later collected into the book \"Unirea Basarabiei. Rolul organiza\u021biilor militare moldovene\u0219ti \u00een actul unirii\" (\"Bessarabia's Union. The Role of Moldavian Military Units in the Act of Union\"). A second edition, published in 1932, had a eulogistic foreword by Nicolae Iorga, the historian and political ally; the book also received endorsements from P\u00e2ntea's former colleagues (Catilli, Cijevschi etc.). Around 1935, P\u00e2ntea's account was rejected by historian &lt;a href=\"Emanoil%20Hagi-Moscu\"&gt;Emanoil Hagi-Moscu&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Epoca%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Epoca&lt;/a&gt;\" newspaper, who discussed P\u00e2ntea's statements of loyalty toward the Russian Republic, and even alleged that the Director had been responsible for the January 1918 attack on the Transylvanian volunteers. With his own version of events supported by Iorga, P\u00e2ntea sued Hagi-Moscu for &lt;a href=\"slander\"&gt;slander&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween 1934 and 1937, when he resumed his activity a lawyer, P\u00e2ntea sat on Chi\u0219in\u0103u City Hall's Board of Revision. He reconciled with the PNL, but the party resented his earlier disloyalty: also in 1937, he left the PNL, never to return. In October 1937, he was an honored guest at the festive anniversary of the Moldavian Soldiers' Congress, in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. That year, he alo published the second volume of his memoirs: \"Unirea Basarabiei. Dou\u0103 decenii de la autonomia Basarabiei\" (\"Bessarabia's Union. Two Decades since the Bessarabian Autonomy\").\nCarol II's regime and the loss of Bessarabia.\nP\u00e2ntea witnessed the rise of &lt;a href=\"fascism\"&gt;fascism&lt;/a&gt; in Romania, confirmed when the PNL lost the &lt;a href=\"1937%20Romanian%20general%20election\"&gt;December 1937 election&lt;/a&gt;; in those circumstances, &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Romania\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carol%20II%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Carol II&lt;/a&gt; appointed the &lt;a href=\"far%20right\"&gt;far right&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Octavian%20Goga\"&gt;Octavian Goga&lt;/a&gt; as Premier. The move alarmed the Soviets, and clashed with their &lt;a href=\"popular%20front\"&gt;popular front&lt;/a&gt; policy: according to P\u00e2ntea, Ambassador Ostrovsky called on him to inform Romanians that Stalin and France's &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9on%20Blum\"&gt;L\u00e9on Blum&lt;/a&gt; insisted that Goga should be deposed and Romania taken out of \"the fascist camp\". P\u00e2ntea maintained that, on its own, Ostrovsky's warning to Carol II resulted in the formation of a new Romanian cabinet, headed by &lt;a href=\"Miron%20Cristea\"&gt;Miron Cristea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe new regime was an &lt;a href=\"Authoritarianism\"&gt;authoritarian&lt;/a&gt; one, centered on Carol II, and confirmed by the &lt;a href=\"1938%20Constitution%20of%20Romania\"&gt;1938 Constitution of Romania&lt;/a&gt;. Parliament was practically dissolved, but, as a long-time member of the former Assembly, Gherman P\u00e2ntea was assigned a permanent seat in the reorganized &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian Senate&lt;/a&gt;. Following Carol's administrative restructuring, he was also named counsel at the superior court of &lt;a href=\"%C8%9Ainutul%20Nistru\"&gt;\u021ainutul Nistru&lt;/a&gt;. He was at odds with &lt;a href=\"Grigore%20Cazacliu\"&gt;Grigore Cazacliu&lt;/a&gt;, the King's Resident (Governor), accusing him of dishonest business practices.\nDuring the first years of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Romania was caught between the hostile governments of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; and the Soviet Union (\"see &lt;a href=\"Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact\"&gt;Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romania%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Romania in World War II&lt;/a&gt;\"). In that context, the Soviets communicated an ultimatum to Romania, and &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20occupation%20of%20Bessarabia%20and%20Northern%20Bukovina\"&gt;occupied Bessarabia&lt;/a&gt; (June 1940). P\u00e2ntea and his family escaped to Bucharest, where the refugee politician continued his work with the Bessarabian Circle. Later that year, German pressures resulted in the loss of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Transylvania\"&gt;Northern Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;, which confirmed the break-up of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Romania\"&gt;Greater Romania&lt;/a&gt;. By then, the Bessarabian Circle represented a 120,000-strong refugee community, having Incule\u021b and &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Ciugureanu\"&gt;Daniel Ciugureanu&lt;/a&gt; as Presidents, Bosie-Codreanu and P\u00e2ntea as Vice Presidents.\nThe major territorial losses resulted in Carol's fall from power, and inaugurated the &lt;a href=\"National%20Legionary%20State\"&gt;National Legionary State&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Antonescu\"&gt;Ion Antonescu&lt;/a&gt; as \"&lt;a href=\"Conduc%C4%83tor\"&gt;Conduc\u0103tor&lt;/a&gt;\". Initially, this regime followed Nazi policy, and prevented the more obvious displays of Bessarabian unionism, leading P\u00e2ntea to exclaim: \"General Antonescu [...] cannot speak his mind on all subjects, so hopefully he would allow us to discuss and to shout out the issue of our justice\". In May, shortly after the Antonescu regime had restructured itself (\"see &lt;a href=\"Legionary%20Rebellion\"&gt;Legionary Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;\"), P\u00e2ntea entered a dispute with other members of the Bessarabian Circle, and resigned from the post of Vice President.\nOdessa massacre.\nOn June 22, 1941, a little more than a year into the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia, Romania partook in the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Barbarossa\"&gt;surprise attack on Soviet territory&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"Axis%20Powers\"&gt;Axis country&lt;/a&gt;. Gherman P\u00e2ntea was mobilized and dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Army%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Fourth Army&lt;/a&gt;, where he was legal adviser to General &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Ciuperc%C4%83\"&gt;Nicolae Ciuperc\u0103&lt;/a&gt;. The latter asked him to review a list of 100 Bessarabian \"undesirables\", singled out for their left-wing opinions and facing summary execution\u2014Ciuperc\u0103 wanted his secretary to ensure that no \"good Romanians\" had been included, but P\u00e2ntea was able to obtain that the order itself be postponed. Among those rescued as a result of his objection were the communist activists &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Stere\"&gt;Gheorghe Stere&lt;/a&gt; (son of Bessarabian unionist &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Stere\"&gt;Constantin Stere&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20M%C3%AE%C8%9B%C4%83\"&gt;Alexandru M\u00ee\u021b\u0103&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe extension of Romanian rule into a new eastern province, carved out under the name of \"&lt;a href=\"Transnistria%20Governorate\"&gt;Transnistria&lt;/a&gt;\", brought P\u00e2ntea to high office. As P\u00e2ntea later noted, Antonescu considered him a suitable Transnistria Governor, but revised his stance when he discovered that P\u00e2ntea still did not support his policies. Consequently, P\u00e2ntea was assigned &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Odessa\"&gt;Mayorship of Odessa&lt;/a&gt;, taking hold of his seat only after the city's &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Odessa%20%281941%29\"&gt;violent siege&lt;/a&gt; had been completed. In order to appease the Germans, Odessa was formally kept out of Transnistria, and the Odessa Mayor's office remained separated from those of other Romanian administrators. Among the latter, Transnistrian Governor &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Alexianu\"&gt;Gheorghe Alexianu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gendarmerie%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt; commander &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Vasiliu\"&gt;Constantin Vasiliu&lt;/a&gt; and Army General &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Ghineraru\"&gt;Nicolae Ghineraru&lt;/a&gt; regarded P\u00e2ntea with particular disdain or mistrust.\nInstead of condoning the Romanian- and German-led mass murder of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Ukraine\"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; and Bessarabian Jews (\"see &lt;a href=\"Holocaust%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Holocaust in Romania&lt;/a&gt;\"), P\u00e2ntea is credited with having saved many of the potential victims\u2014probably numbering in the thousands. On October 22, 1941, P\u00e2ntea issued a proclamation in \"Odesskaya Gazeta\", promising a return to normal, and announced freedom and equality between all Odessans. However, this statement was rendered ineffectual by events which occurred on the same day: an explosion on Marazlie Street took the life of General &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Glogojeanu\"&gt;Ioan Glogojeanu&lt;/a&gt; and other Romanian officials. The Antonescu regime supposed a terrorist attack, ignoring all accounts according to which the retreating &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; had mined the location. Reportedly, P\u00e2ntea and his Transnistrian colleague &lt;a href=\"Nichita%20Smochin%C4%83\"&gt;Nichita Smochin\u0103&lt;/a&gt; were informed of the mining, and tried to warn their superiors not to enter the Marazile building.\nAntonescu's reaction was sanguinary, and a collective blame was placed on the Odessa Jews. The community was decimated during what became known as the \"&lt;a href=\"1941%20Odessa%20massacre\"&gt;1941 Odessa massacre&lt;/a&gt;\". As a witness to this slaughter, P\u00e2ntea noted that 450 Jewish people were hanged on the first day, others were randomly shot, and still others were rounded up, their fate to be determined by General &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Macici\"&gt;Nicolae Macici&lt;/a&gt;. P\u00e2ntea thereafter worked to persuade Macici that the killing quota imposed by Antonescu was excessive. On October 23, he and Macici asked Governor Alexianu to turn back the column of Jews sent on a death march. They registered only partial success, as some of the deportees returned: according to P\u00e2ntea, all but 2,000 survived the experience. However, researchers of the events record a much higher death toll. According to them, Romanian troops randomly murdered some 20,000 or 30,000 of those sent on convoys.\nThe following week, the Mayor contacted socialite &lt;a href=\"Alexandrina%20Cantacuzino\"&gt;Alexandrina Cantacuzino&lt;/a&gt; and presented her with a report on the Massacre, which she was to hand over to Antonescu. In assigning blame for the killings, P\u00e2ntea noted that he himself was not a defender of the Jews, but a man concerned with justice. His document highlighted the acts of \"barbarity\" and the \"un-Romanian\" behavior of various officials; Antonescu threatened to have the author shot on the spot, but later ordered an investigation into some cases of abuse.\nPlan for Odessa.\nP\u00e2ntea maintained Odessa a functional metropolis, with adequate food and electricity supplies, and as such, when compared to the rest of Transnistria, city life flourished under most of his mandate. He assigned engineer Lisenko, who had flooded the Odessa &lt;a href=\"power%20station\"&gt;power station&lt;/a&gt; during the Soviet retreat, to build a new electrical substation; once this began operating, he reopened the &lt;a href=\"Odessa%20Opera%20and%20Ballet%20Theater\"&gt;Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater&lt;/a&gt;, refurbished &lt;a href=\"Odessa%20University\"&gt;Odessa University&lt;/a&gt; (while building a close relationship with the students), and cleared for use the city's tramway lines. Businesses also reopened, benefiting from &lt;a href=\"free%20trade\"&gt;free trade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"voluntary%20taxation\"&gt;voluntary taxation&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the city treasury, P\u00e2ntea claimed, collected some 170 million \"&lt;a href=\"Reichsmark\"&gt;Reichsmark&lt;/a&gt;\" in revenue. According to historian &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Mazower\"&gt;Mark Mazower&lt;/a&gt;, the experiment was largely carried by corrupt practices, but also gave the Soviet-born Odessans a unique experience of &lt;a href=\"capitalism\"&gt;capitalism&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiberal enterprise coexisted with the minute regulation of social life: in Russia, P\u00e2ntea's resolutions on this subject are remembered as farcical and unwittingly humorous. One of them limited children's use of bicycles and &lt;a href=\"roller%20skates\"&gt;roller skates&lt;/a&gt;, under the pain of &lt;a href=\"court-martial\"&gt;court-martial&lt;/a&gt; for their parents. The cultural projects he promoted doubled as a propaganda effort: the new authorities staged shows which suggested that Odessa was, and would remain, part of a new Greater Romania. During 1943, he renamed Avchinnikov Street after &lt;a href=\"Octavian%20Goga\"&gt;Octavian Goga&lt;/a&gt;, and turned a lodging once visited by Goga into a hotel for Romanian writers on vacation to \"Romanian Odessa\".\nSome of the Russian locals played along, in a bit to ensure cultural survival. Among the latter was actor Vasily Vronsky (Vasile Vronschi), who knew P\u00e2ntea from Chi\u0219in\u0103u, and who received permission to establish the Russian-language Vronsky Theater; granted Romanian citizenship, he gave speeches denouncing Soviet &lt;a href=\"agitprop\"&gt;agitprop&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring January 1942, there was another planned exodus of Jews from Odessa. P\u00e2ntea, whose official reports described the claim of \"Jewish instigation\" as a canard, was reportedly alarmed by the decision. Mostly in vain, he tried persuading Alexianu to reduce the number of Odessa Jews delivered to &lt;a href=\"Berezivka\"&gt;Berezivka&lt;/a&gt; concentration camp\u2014the Mayor hoped to at least obtain the return of Jews who were artisans, teachers or &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20Karaites\"&gt;Crimean Karaites&lt;/a&gt;. His own membership of the Eviction Bureau remains a contended issue: P\u00e2ntea categorically denied it (a negation that is backed by Ion Constantin, and reflected in various primary sources); nevertheless, one archive document refers to him as one of ten supervisors of the 1942 deportation. He also took measures against &lt;a href=\"squatting\"&gt;squatting&lt;/a&gt; in formerly Jewish houses, but, historian and former &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20partisans\"&gt;Soviet partisan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yitzhak%20Arad\"&gt;Yitzhak Arad&lt;/a&gt; argues, meant to \"keep those apartments for the Romanian administration [...] and to sell a certain number of the apartments to turn a profit.\"\nIn time, Mayor P\u00e2ntea found a middle ground between the various political factors, and selected his own administrative team from a mixture of Bessarabian and Soviet clerks. In addition to Vice Mayor Vidra\u0219cu, it included old unionist combatants (&lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Chiorescu\"&gt;Vladimir Chiorescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elefterie%20Sinicliu\"&gt;Elefterie Sinicliu&lt;/a&gt;) and Odessan notabilities (Dr. M. Zaevloshin, architect Vladimir Cundert). Reportedly, City Hall did not exercise political repression against known communists, who were merely required to register on a special list. The Romanian Mayor was also careful to preserve contacts with the two most powerful forces battling each other for control, namely the Germans and the Soviet partisans. His intervention saved the life of Yelena Rudenko, sister of Soviet General &lt;a href=\"Fyodor%20Tolbukhin\"&gt;Fyodor Tolbukhin&lt;/a&gt;, who had fallen severely ill at the family home in Odessa.\nAlexianu was especially weary of the Mayor's web of connections. In December 1941, he inquired P\u00e2ntea about his alleged employment of political suspects, which P\u00e2ntea categorically denied. In 1942, government embarked on a complex, but erratic, investigation into the presence of former &lt;a href=\"Komsomol\"&gt;Komsomol&lt;/a&gt;ists among Odessa's public sector employees. Allegations regarding P\u00e2ntea's complicity in some acts of corruption prompted additional surveillance from &lt;a href=\"Serviciul%20Special%20de%20Informa%C8%9Bii\"&gt;Romanian Special Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Its subsequent reports accused the Mayor and some in his staff of keeping company with covert communists, and of trading on the &lt;a href=\"black%20market\"&gt;black market&lt;/a&gt; of Chi\u0219in\u0103u. Later, sources adverse to P\u00e2ntea claimed that he was the main beneficiary of trade in &lt;a href=\"Moldovan%20wine\"&gt;Moldovan wine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"used%20good\"&gt;used good&lt;/a&gt;s, and that he had vested interest in aiding the Transnistrian Jews, who were his business partners.\nBy late 1942, P\u00e2ntea again irritated the Romanian commandants, when he complained that General Vasiliu had requisitioned Odessa's &lt;a href=\"trolleybus\"&gt;trolleybus&lt;/a&gt;es and moved them to &lt;a href=\"Craiova\"&gt;Craiova&lt;/a&gt;, in southern Romania. P\u00e2ntea still tried to enforce his own plans for Odessa's development. In October 1943, on the 2-year anniversary of the occupation, he issued, by means of \"Molva\" gazette, a new address to the city's residents, in which he proudly listed his contributions. A few weeks later, he began employing laborers from the neighboring \"&lt;a href=\"Reichskommissariat%20Ukraine\"&gt;Reichskommissariat Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;\" for a new set of public works in Odessa.\n1945 prosecution.\nDuring January 1944, as the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; moved closer to Romania, Alexianu's bureaucracy was replaced with a defensive military structure, headed by General &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Potopeanu\"&gt;Gheorghe Potopeanu&lt;/a&gt;. P\u00e2ntea considered his own position redundant, and asked to be recalled, but Antonescu ordered him to continue with his mandate. He was still at his post when Potopeanu relinquished his command to the Germans, and protested as Potopeanu handed over to the Nazis all property that Romania had confiscated from Soviet citizens. Enmity between the two Romanian administrators was on the rise. According to one account, Potopeanu still remembered that P\u00e2ntea had tried to sell him a grossly overpriced used car.\nDuring March, P\u00e2ntea was himself forced to relinquish City Hall property, assigning it to the Germans. After farewell ceremonies at the University and in the factories, he and his wife Lucia left to join the retreating Romanian troops. The P\u00e2nteas were in Bucharest during &lt;a href=\"King%20Michael%27s%20Coup\"&gt;King Michael's Coup&lt;/a&gt; (August 23, 1944), with which Romania effectively changed sides in the war by toppling Antonescu. Their house on Argentina Street was damaged in the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Bombing%20of%20Bucharest%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Nazi air raid&lt;/a&gt;, and the family moved with politician &lt;a href=\"Petre%20Ghia%C8%9B%C4%83\"&gt;Petre Ghia\u021b\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Colentina%2C%20Bucharest\"&gt;Colentina&lt;/a&gt;. On August 24, Gheorghe Potopeanu, who had emerged as &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Public%20Finance%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Finance Minister&lt;/a&gt;, demanded P\u00e2ntea's arrest as a potential turncoat; and since the political transition found P\u00e2ntea included on the transitional regime's list of enemies, it was also assumed that he was one of Antonescu's war criminals.\nThe post-Antonescu government of &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20S%C4%83n%C4%83tescu\"&gt;Constantin S\u0103n\u0103tescu&lt;/a&gt; proceeded to include him P\u00e2ntea a revised list of war criminals, even though its Soviet partners still did not describe him as such. When the Red Army entered Bucharest in September, it arrested Potopeanu at his Ministry desk. Meanwhile, P\u00e2ntea decided to obey the new legislation, and handed down to the state all items of property he had taken on as Mayor. By January 1945, when the S\u0103n\u0103tescu list was published, P\u00e2ntea turned fugitive: for a while, he lived in Craiova, where his brother Constantin resided; later, he was in &lt;a href=\"Sibiu\"&gt;Sibiu&lt;/a&gt;, living under the assumed name of \"Lozont\" (or \"Lozony\") \"Cernescu\".\nLike Antonescu and Potopeanu, P\u00e2ntea faced trial in front of the newly created &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20People%27s%20Tribunals\"&gt;People's Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, he was acquitted, since Yelena Rudenko and Tolbukhin informed the Romanian state about P\u00e2ntea's honorable conduct, and since the &lt;a href=\"Allied%20Commission\"&gt;Allied Commission&lt;/a&gt; recommended his release. P\u00e2ntea was arrested on several other occasions, but, singularly among Romanians prosecuted for war crimes, he was acquitted each time. Although his rivals in the Transnistrian administration were by then destroying evidence of his more positive role in the affairs of state, P\u00e2ntea preserved &lt;a href=\"Certified%20copy\"&gt;certified copies&lt;/a&gt; as a precautionary measure.\nCommunist sentencing and rehabilitation.\nIn 1947, &lt;a href=\"Ilie%20C%C4%83t%C4%83r%C4%83u\"&gt;Ilie C\u0103t\u0103r\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; vindicated his 1918 deportation on P\u00e2ntea's orders, and began circulating serious allegations against his rival. Published in the Romanian press, these resulted in a national manhunt for P\u00e2ntea. Fearing a political retribution, the latter made himself lost in Sibiu, where he lived with false papers until December 1949. He was making short visits to Bucharest with forged identity papers and the alias \"George Mincu\", and kept contacts with &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Crihan\"&gt;Anton Crihan&lt;/a&gt;, who was preparing for a defection to &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20occupation%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Soviet occupation&lt;/a&gt; gave way to a satellite &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian communist regime&lt;/a&gt;. P\u00e2ntea was tracked down by famed Commissar &lt;a href=\"Eugen%20Alim%C4%83nescu\"&gt;Eugen Alim\u0103nescu&lt;/a&gt; and handed down to the &lt;a href=\"Securitate\"&gt;Securitate&lt;/a&gt; (that is, the communist secret police). He was interrogated by Securitate commandant &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Nicolschi\"&gt;Alexandru Nicolschi&lt;/a&gt;, and confronted with allegations made against him by &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Stere\"&gt;Gheorghe Stere&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20M%C3%AE%C8%9B%C4%83\"&gt;Alexandru M\u00ee\u021b\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, whose lives P\u00e2ntea had helped save. P\u00e2ntea was sent to &lt;a href=\"Jilava%20prison\"&gt;Jilava prison&lt;/a&gt;, and kept without trial for three years; in late 1952, a Military Tribunal sentenced him to a further 10-years &lt;a href=\"Penal%20labour\"&gt;hard labor&lt;/a&gt;, as a \"war criminal\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Enemy%20of%20the%20people\"&gt;enemy of the working class&lt;/a&gt;\". His first year after the verdict was spent under heavy regime, at &lt;a href=\"Aiud%20prison\"&gt;Aiud prison&lt;/a&gt;, but P\u00e2ntea was later moved into other infamously tough detention facilities: &lt;a href=\"Gherla%20Prison\"&gt;Gherla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ocnele%20Mari\"&gt;Ocnele Mari&lt;/a&gt;. In November 1954, he was dispatched to a milder prison, at Craiova, and then sent to &lt;a href=\"Poarta%20Alb%C4%83\"&gt;Poarta Alb\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, a labor camp on the &lt;a href=\"Danube%E2%80%93Black%20Sea%20Canal\"&gt;Danube\u2013Black Sea Canal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn October 1955, Gherman P\u00e2ntea was included in an amnesty decreed by the Romanian communist authorities, as the early sign of a reluctant &lt;a href=\"liberalization\"&gt;liberalization&lt;/a&gt;. In January of the next year, he was even partially &lt;a href=\"Rehabilitation%20%28Soviet%29\"&gt;rehabilitated&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"trial%20de%20novo\"&gt;trial de novo&lt;/a&gt; for some 800 sentenced war criminals. After gathering evidence and testimonials from Soviet nationals, he took his case to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20of%20Cassation%20and%20Justice\"&gt;Supreme Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, which concluded that his sentencing as a \"war criminal\" was illegal (while finding little evidence that his were crimes \"against the working class\"). However, the Securitate still kept a file on P\u00e2ntea, keeping him and his family under constant surveillance. At a time when repression was organized against the Bessarabian refugees, its staff gathered data according to which P\u00e2ntea was capable of organizing Bessarabian resistance in Romania-proper. With noted help from the Soviet &lt;a href=\"KGB\"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; and a female Soviet envoy (codenamed \"Valeria\"), the secret police began re-investigating P\u00e2ntea's various activities in politics. The Securitate archives also show that Securitate men approached the former Bessarabian Director with an offer to become their informant, but register P\u00e2ntea's blunt refusal, even after intimidation.\nFinal years and death.\nCommunist harassment continued over the following years. After the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956\"&gt;Hungarian Revolution of 1956&lt;/a&gt;, the Securitate kept close watch on P\u00e2ntea's reaction, reporting about his &lt;a href=\"anti-communism\"&gt;anti-communism&lt;/a&gt;, his contacts with the exiled Crihan or underground PNL-ists such as &lt;a href=\"Aurelian%20Bentoiu\"&gt;Aurelian Bentoiu&lt;/a&gt;, and his hopes for an &lt;a href=\"Vin%20americanii%21\"&gt;American intervention&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, through a decision signed by Nicolschi in 1960, he and his wife were stripped of their pensions. Officially, the P\u00e2nteas stood accused of illegally trading in gold coins; a brutal police inquiry followed, and Lucia P\u00e2ntea's arm was fractured in the process, but the prosecution was stopped in its tracks by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20National%20Assembly\"&gt;Great National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. Gherman and brother Constantin were again picked up in April 1961, and detained in the prison of Craiova together with other 5 \"&lt;a href=\"reactionary\"&gt;reactionary&lt;/a&gt; elements\" from Bessarabia\u2014in 1962, all were sentenced to 1 year in jail.\nAround 1964, as Romania embraced (nominally anti-Soviet) &lt;a href=\"national%20communism\"&gt;national communism&lt;/a&gt;, P\u00e2ntea began hoping that &lt;a href=\"Censorship%20in%20Communist%20Romania\"&gt;communist censorship&lt;/a&gt; would revisit the Bessarabian dispute from a traditional viewpoint. In this context, he corresponded with official historian &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20O%C8%9Betea\"&gt;Andrei O\u021betea&lt;/a&gt;, praising his \"courage and clarity\" in exposing the hidden side of &lt;a href=\"Marxist%20historiography\"&gt;Marxist historiography&lt;/a&gt;. He himself began writing new memoirs for the &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Iorga%20Institute%20of%20History\"&gt;Bucharest Institute of History&lt;/a&gt;, and, on &lt;a href=\"International%20Workers%27%20Day\"&gt;May Day&lt;/a&gt; 1965, began receiving a state pension honoring his \"outstanding contributions in service to the working class during the years 1919\u20131926\". By 1967, P\u00e2ntea made a final return to the public sphere, openly restating his version of historical events. He spoke on the subject at the funeral of fellow Bessarabian refugee &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Buzdugan\"&gt;Ion Buzdugan&lt;/a&gt;, at the \"&lt;a href=\"parastas\"&gt;parastas&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Gurie%20Grosu\"&gt;Gurie Grosu&lt;/a&gt;, and again at a commemoration for &lt;a href=\"Alexe%20Mateevici\"&gt;Alexe Mateevici&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly causing panic among his public (most of whom were by then the survivors of communist jails). The P\u00e2ntea family moved back to Bucharest, at the old home on Argentina Street.\nGherman P\u00e2ntea died on February 1, 1968, in unusual circumstances: he had been absent from home for almost two days, and the family was informed that he had collapsed in the street, minutes after being spotted at a &lt;a href=\"Pia%C8%9Ba%20Amzei\"&gt;Pia\u021ba Amzei&lt;/a&gt; diner; medical investigation showed that he was not suffering from any life-threatening condition. The funeral was at Bucharest's &lt;a href=\"Bellu%20Cemetery\"&gt;Bellu Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, on February 4. The ceremony, which included an Orthodox service by priest &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20%C8%9Aepordei\"&gt;Vasile \u021aepordei&lt;/a&gt;, doubled as a low-key political rally: it brought together the community of Bessarabian refugees, who regarded P\u00e2ntea as their hero, and was closely monitored by the Securitate. The funeral orations were delivered by, among others, Father \u021aepordei, Sinicliu, and his 1921 rival, Halippa.\nLegacy.\nGherman P\u00e2ntea is briefly mentioned in \"For Soviet Power\", a 1953 war novel by Soviet author &lt;a href=\"Valentin%20Kataev\"&gt;Valentin Kataev&lt;/a&gt;. Here, in keeping up with &lt;a href=\"Historiography%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet historiography&lt;/a&gt; of the late Stalin period, he is mainly depicted as a criminal figure who takes absurd decisions. In contrast, the Bessarabian folklorist &lt;a href=\"Tatiana%20G%C4%83lu%C8%99c%C4%83-Cr%C3%A2%C8%99maru\"&gt;Tatiana G\u0103lu\u0219c\u0103-Cr\u00e2\u0219maru&lt;/a&gt; composed the 1968 poem \"Lui Gh. P\u00e2ntea, vechi lupt\u0103tor\" (\"To Gh. P\u00e2ntea, and Old Combatant\"), which depicts the Moldavian Republic's Director as a hero of the entire Romanian people. Between these images is one proposed by the Bessarabian expatriate and Romanian historian &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20I.%20Gon%C8%9Ba\"&gt;Alexandru I. Gon\u021ba&lt;/a&gt;, according to whom P\u00e2ntea is a relevant but second-rate figure in the history of Bessarabian unionism (this view, first made public in 1973, is hotly contested by other authors and activists).\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Revolution%20of%201989\"&gt;Romanian Revolution of 1989&lt;/a&gt;, as Romania's participation in the Holocaust was being acknowledged, various commentators contrasted Gherman P\u00e2ntea's behavior with that of other Transnistria administrators. According to Romanian-born &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i historian &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Ancel\"&gt;Jean Ancel&lt;/a&gt;, P\u00e2ntea's protest against Antonescu's orders is compatible with the work of his &lt;a href=\"Chernivtsi\"&gt;Cern\u0103u\u021bi&lt;/a&gt; colleague &lt;a href=\"Traian%20Popovici\"&gt;Traian Popovici&lt;/a&gt;, known for defending &lt;a href=\"Bukovina%20Jews\"&gt;Bukovina Jews&lt;/a&gt; from planned extermination. In 2008, a similar point was made by writer &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Marian\"&gt;Boris Marian&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Jewish community&lt;/a&gt; magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Realitatea%20Evreiasc%C4%83\"&gt;Realitatea Evreiasc\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\": \"The Romanian Mayor of Odessa was shocked by the cruelty with which the orders coming in from Bucharest were being executed. His name was Gherman P\u00e2ntea and he was a normal man. Like Mayor Traian Popovici of Cern\u0103u\u021bi, Gh. P\u00e2ntea wished above all to fulfill his duty as a human being.\"\nOn the commemoration of the &lt;a href=\"1941%20Odessa%20massacre\"&gt;Odessa Massacre&lt;/a&gt; in 2011, Romanian filmmaker Florin Iepan produced the documentary \"Odessa\", which gives evidence about the scale of murder. In an earlier interview, Iepan mentioned that P\u00e2ntea was \"an interesting character\" and \"a rather luminous figure in that context of bitterness and violence.\" During debates with the public, held after the film's release, Iepan also quoted P\u00e2ntea's report to Antonescu as proof that some Romanian officials knew about (and, in this case, deplored) the killings in the city.\nHowever, P\u00e2ntea's own testimonies on the Holocaust subject have various ambiguities and omissions. &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Mazower\"&gt;Mark Mazower&lt;/a&gt; notes that, in writing his reports, P\u00e2ntea never realized the level of Antonescu's involvement in the 1941 Massacre. Before the &lt;a href=\"Wiesel%20Commission\"&gt;official recognition of Holocaust crimes&lt;/a&gt;, the Odessa Mayor's accounts were being cited against themselves by those who tried to minimize Romanian involvement. In reaction, Jewish community historian Teodor Wexler argued that the attempt was missing its target: \"Gherman P\u00e2ntea's letter [is] of an unrestrained tragicalness\", confirming \"once and for all the historical responsibility of those who dictated the undertaking of the Holocaust in Romania.\"\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;dissolution of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1991, most of Bessarabia returned to independence, as the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Moldova\"&gt;Republic of Moldova&lt;/a&gt;. As of that moment, P\u00e2ntea's name continues to be a subject of contention in the &lt;a href=\"Controversy%20over%20linguistic%20and%20ethnic%20identity%20in%20Moldova\"&gt;debates over Moldovan nationhood&lt;/a&gt;: a hero to the &lt;a href=\"Movement%20for%20the%20unification%20of%20Romania%20and%20Moldova\"&gt;pro-unionists&lt;/a&gt;, he is largely ignored by the &lt;a href=\"Moldovenism\"&gt;Moldovenists&lt;/a&gt;. This was noted in 2010 by unionist politician &lt;a href=\"Mircea%20Druc\"&gt;Mircea Druc&lt;/a&gt;, who assessed that, other than a commemorative plaque in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, there was little left to attest P\u00e2ntea's significance to the Moldovan Republic. &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Costin\"&gt;Nicolae Costin&lt;/a&gt;, who was &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u\"&gt;Mayor of Chi\u0219in\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; between 1990 and 1994, reportedly sought to revive P\u00e2ntea's urban projects (continued, after another long hiatus, by &lt;a href=\"Dorin%20Chirtoac%C4%83\"&gt;Dorin Chirtoac\u0103&lt;/a&gt;).\nExternal links.\n "
