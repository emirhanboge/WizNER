    "text": "Maine Township High School District 207 is a school district based in &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.\nComposed of all of &lt;a href=\"Park%20Ridge%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Park Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and most of &lt;a href=\"Des%20Plaines%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Des Plaines&lt;/a&gt;, as well as portions of &lt;a href=\"Glenview%2C%20Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Glenview&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Heights%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Harwood Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morton%20Grove%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Morton Grove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Niles%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Niles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norridge%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Norridge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Norwood%20Park%20Township%2C%20Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Norwood Park Township&lt;/a&gt;, the district lies 30 minutes from downtown &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. Primarily residential with some light industry, office developments and shopping centers, the district is adjacent to &lt;a href=\"O%27Hare%20International%20Airport\"&gt;O'Hare International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and lies at the hub of rail and highway transportation (sections of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2090%20in%20Illinois\"&gt;I-90&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20190%20%28Illinois%29\"&gt;I-190&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"I-294\"&gt;I-294&lt;/a&gt; lie within the district boundaries). The district has earned many national awards including being named as one of \u201cMost Innovative School Districts\u201d for its unique approaches to expand and support teacher learning and student success both during and after high school by &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20of%20School%20Administrators\"&gt;AASA&lt;/a&gt;. In 2007, District 207 became Google\u2019s first elementary and secondary school district Google Apps for Education partner.\nFrost Academy.\nDistrict 207 operates Frost Academy, an alternative placement for students who have not found success in a traditional school setting, and require a more structured environment. The program was formerly called ARC.\nDistrict Headquarters.\nThe district administrative offices are located at 1177 S. Dee Road, at the southwest corner of the property on which Maine South is located. This building was sold to the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.tmanet.com/\"&gt;Tooling and Manufacturing Association of Chicago&lt;/a&gt; when the district offices were then moved into a section of Maine South. This section was refurbished to provide a boardroom for meetings, as well as offices for the superintendent, assistants and the business office. \n In 2014, the district re-purchased the location at 1177 S. Dee Road where the district administrative offices and Frost Academy are now housed.\nDistrict Leadership.\nMaine Township High School District 207 is governed by a seven-member &lt;a href=\"board%20of%20education\"&gt;board of education&lt;/a&gt;. This board is the &lt;a href=\"legislative\"&gt;legislative&lt;/a&gt;, policy-setting authority of the school district and while the board is the hiring authority and approves all hiring (following recommendations by the &lt;a href=\"Superintendent%20%28education%29\"&gt;Superintendent&lt;/a&gt; or their designee), the board's only direct employee is the Superintendent of Schools. The Superintendent of Schools is the &lt;a href=\"executive%20%28government%29\"&gt;executive&lt;/a&gt; authority of the &lt;a href=\"school%20district\"&gt;school district&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Board undergoes an annual reorganization each April, where the Board elects a president and vice president from among their number.\nBoard of Education.\nMembers of the Board of Education are elected to four year terms, with elections held in the Spring of odd-numbered years. Candidates must be 18 years old, a legal resident of the district for at least one year prior to the election, and must be a registered voter. School trustees and the school treasure for the township are specifically forbidden from running for the Board. Board members cannot have any interest in any contract with the District, and are required to file an Economic Interest Statement each year for verification.\nIn odd-numbered years, the Board elects a president, vice president, and secretary from among its members in the first meeting after the election. These positions are held for a period of one year. In even-numbered years, the election is held at the first meeting in the month of April.\nSuperintendent of Schools.\nThe Superintendent of Schools for Maine Township High School District 207 is Dr. Ken Wallace who assumed those duties on July 1, 2009.\nThe Superintendent is supported by four assistant superintendents; one in curriculum, one in business, one in technology and learning, and one in general administration who deals primarily with personnel.\n\"Wiemerslage vs. Maine Township High School District 207\".\nThe district was a defendant in a federal court case, \"Wiemerslage vs. Maine Township High School District 207\", 29 F.3d 1149, which helped reaffirm the doctrine of &lt;a href=\"In%20loco%20parentis\"&gt;In loco parentis&lt;/a&gt;, the rights of schools to act in the place of parents in certain situations. The case involved a Maine South High School student who was suspended for loitering near a gate which gave access to school grounds from a neighborhood area. Students were permitted to use the gate to get to and from school, but were explicitly forbidden to loiter in the area due to complaints from neighbors about property damage and other problematic behavior.\nThe student and his family sued in 1993, citing violations of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Amendment%20%28U.S.%20Constitution%29\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;Fourteenth Amendments&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;United States Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. The District's motion to dismiss the case was granted by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20Illinois\"&gt;United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Seventh%20Circuit\"&gt;United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit&lt;/a&gt; upheld the dismissal, holding that the school had acted \"appropriately\".\n2010 budget cuts.\nThe 2009\u201310 school year saw the need for a $15 million cut to the district's budget. The cuts included the dismissal of 75 teachers and 62 other staff members. According to district officials, the cause of the financial crisis was due to a \"flat &lt;a href=\"Consumer%20Price%20Index\"&gt;Consumer Price Index&lt;/a&gt;\" which helps determine property values and the corresponding property taxes from which the school raises a large percentage of its monies. The problem was identified in July 2009 when the projected &lt;a href=\"deficit%20spending\"&gt;deficit spending&lt;/a&gt; of $3.8 million for the year was found to be $10.3 million; 2.7 times larger than anticipated. At a public meeting that drew more than 3,000 community members, a representative of the teachers' union claimed that the deficit spending was due to a lack of oversight from school officials.\nPassage of Referendum for School Upgrades.\nIn the fall of 2018, voters living in the school district approved the passage of a $195 million bond issue with 61% of the votes. The money will be used to improve safety and security, replace outdated plumbing, electrical and mechanical systems, and update classrooms and labs at all three high schools to create flexible learning spaces that promote collaboration."
