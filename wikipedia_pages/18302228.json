    "text": "The Isthmus of Catalina Island is a 770-meter (842 yards) section of land that joins the northwestern portion of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Catalina%20Island%2C%20California\"&gt;Santa Catalina Island&lt;/a&gt; to the main part of the island. It lies approximately southwest of &lt;a href=\"San%20Pedro%20Harbor\"&gt;San Pedro Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the &lt;a href=\"isthmus\"&gt;isthmus&lt;/a&gt; is occupied by the town of &lt;a href=\"Two%20Harbors%2C%20California\"&gt;Two Harbors&lt;/a&gt;, named for two harbors on either side of the isthmus, Isthmus Cove and Catalina Harbor. Two Harbors lies on the &lt;a href=\"Windward%20and%20leeward\"&gt;leeward&lt;/a&gt; side facing Isthmus Cove. The northern part of Santa Catalina contains about one sixth (31.7\u00a0km\u00b2) of the entire island's land mass."
