Students from &lt;a href=\"Cranbury%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Cranbury Township&lt;/a&gt; attend PHS as part of a &lt;a href=\"sending/receiving%20relationship\"&gt;sending/receiving relationship&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Cranbury%20School%20District\"&gt;Cranbury School District&lt;/a&gt;. The school has been accredited by the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20States%20Association%20of%20Colleges%20and%20Schools\"&gt;Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools&lt;/a&gt; Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1932.\nAs of the 2019\u201320 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,582 students and 122.0 classroom teachers (on an &lt;a href=\"full-time%20equivalent\"&gt;FTE&lt;/a&gt; basis), for a &lt;a href=\"student%E2%80%93teacher%20ratio\"&gt;student\u2013teacher ratio&lt;/a&gt; of 13.0:1. There were 107 students (6.8% of enrollment) eligible for &lt;a href=\"National%20School%20Lunch%20Act\"&gt;free lunch&lt;/a&gt; and 35 (2.2% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.\nPHS is notable for its high academic standards and strong arts programs that rival many of the nation's elite private schools. The school has been ranked among the top open-enrollment public high schools in the state and nation. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" recognized the school as having the highest &lt;a href=\"SAT\"&gt;SAT&lt;/a&gt; scores of any open-enrollment public high school in the state in 2009. The school had the fourth-best average combined SAT scores of any open-enrollment public high school in the state in 2019.\nOverview.\nPrinceton High School is located between Moore Street and Walnut Lane. The district middle school, &lt;a href=\"John%20Witherspoon%20Middle%20School\"&gt;Princeton Unified Middle School&lt;/a&gt;, is located across from the high school athletic fields on Walnut Lane.\nThe school offers 200 courses in many subjects and levels, including most of the courses in the &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Placement%20Program\"&gt;Advanced Placement Program&lt;/a&gt;. More than 70% of students take at least one AP or accelerated course. Additionally, the \"High School Program at Princeton University\" permits qualified juniors and seniors to take free courses at &lt;a href=\"Princeton%20University\"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; if they have exhausted all high school course alternatives within a discipline, receiving only high school credit for any university courses successfully completed.\nThe school contains over 250 classrooms, several equipped science labs, two gymnasiums, a performing arts center, a fitness center, a garden, athletic turf and tennis courts. Some of this came from significant reconstruction from 2003 to 2007 as part of an $86 million project to renovate the district's school buildings, also including a new mathematics wing and renovated library.\nAwards, recognition, and rankings.\nNationally, &lt;a href=\"Niche%20%28company%29\"&gt;Niche&lt;/a&gt; ranked Princeton High School as the 47th best public high school in America in its \"2021 Best Public High Schools in America\" rankings and gave it an \"A+\" Overall Niche Grade. PHS ranked in \"&lt;a href=\"Newsweek\"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;\"s top high school list in 2004 (113), 2005 (212), 2006 (113), 2007 (208), 2008 (142), and 2009 (210). In \"&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report\"&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;\", PHS was ranked in 2009 (94), 2010 (113), and 2014 (216). In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\"s \"Most Challenging High Schools\" list, PHS ranked in 2011 (370), 2012 (330), 2013 (322), and 2014 (467).\nIn 2007, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal\"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;\", ranking the country's high schools based on a percentage of 2007 high school seniors sent to eight selective colleges (Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Pomona, University of Chicago, Johns Hopkins, Swarthmore, and Williams), placed PHS at #27. PHS was the second-highest ranked publicly funded school, with a total of 31 students matriculating to those schools.\nStatewide, \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Monthly\"&gt;New Jersey Monthly&lt;/a&gt;\"s \"Top Public High Schools\" has ranked PHS in 2006 (13), 2008 (6), 2010 (44), 2012 (59), 2014 (67), 2016 (15), and 2018 (20).

In 2019, USNWR ranked PHS as the second-best open-enrollment public high school in the state and the twelfth-best high school in the state overall.\nSchool policy.\nSchedule.\nSchool is held Monday through Friday from 8:20\u00a0a.m. - 3:20\u00a0p.m. for 180 days per year. The daily schedule consists of eight academic periods (44 minutes). There are four minutes between each class period for the students to get to their next class.\nIn the 2018\u20132019 school year, the school made significant changes to its schedule. Now, the school days are assigned letter labels, cycling from A through F. Because of a partial-block schedule, only days A\u2013D contain all eight academic periods. Days E and F consist of only four academic periods, each 77 minutes long, with 10 minutes in between each period. Periods 3, 1, 7, and 5 occur on E days, while periods 4, 2, 8, and 6 occur on F days, in the order listed. In addition to this, the order of periods cycles throughout letter days A\u2013D, with periods 1\u20134 cycling independently from periods 5\u20138. An example is shown below.\nBefore the 2018\u20132019 school year, on every Wednesday, (termed \"short Wednesdays\" or \"one-forty-nine days\") and on days when special events are planned, the school day was shortened and ended at 1:49\u00a0p.m. Students attended 35 minute class periods, and homeroom and break periods are not shortened. Short Wednesdays existed to permit the operation of the mandatory freshmen Peer Group program between 1:49 and 2:51. This period of time was also used for community service group meetings for sophomores, other extracurricular activities, and school-wide events such as pep rallies, the Fall Festival, and Spring Fling. For the 2020-2021 school year, due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, the school temporarily switched to a hybrid program, where students are split into cohorts \"A\" and \"B\", with each going to school for alternating weeks, while another cohort, \"Cohort C\", continues &lt;a href=\"remote%20learning\"&gt;remote learning&lt;/a&gt;.\nGraduation requirements.\nIn order to receive a diploma from Princeton High School, students must successfully complete a minimum of 120 credits from grade 9 to grade 12. Each year-long class counts for 5 credits; each semester class counts for 2.5. The exception is science classes that have one or two lab periods count for 5.7 and 6.4 credits, respectively. Additionally, each student must have completed 50 hours of community service, usually completed during a student's sophomore year. Required courses include English I and English II (which must respectively be taken in the first two years) and two more years of English; three years of science, including biology and chemistry; one year of a foreign language, though three years is recommended; three years of mathematics; one year of physical education for every year that the student is enrolled; two years of United States history, one year of world history; one year of visual/performing arts; one year of practical arts; and one half year of financial literacy.\nIn addition, students must show proficiency in the &lt;a href=\"PARCC\"&gt;PARCC&lt;/a&gt; assessment. Previously, the school used the &lt;a href=\"High%20School%20Proficiency%20Assessment\"&gt;HSPA&lt;/a&gt; 11 - the class of 2015 is the last class to rely on this. Students must also pass the Biology State Assessment the year they are enrolled in a Biology course.\nPHS has a policy of revoking credit for a student's course if a certain amount of absences in a class are reached. More than 18 absences from a year-long course or 9 absences for a semester course will lead to credit revocation. Tardiness counts as one-third of an absence for the purposes of revoking credit.\nExtracurricular activities.\nPrinceton High School offers over 100 &lt;a href=\"extracurricular%20activities\"&gt;extracurricular activities&lt;/a&gt;, including clubs, publications, competitive teams, and other organizations.

Students can create their own clubs with prior approval. In December 2014, contract negotiations led to the cancellation of uncompensated activities, including most clubs. This issue was resolved the following school year.\nAthletics.\nThe Princeton High School Little Tigers participate in the &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Valley%20Conference\"&gt;Colonial Valley Conference&lt;/a&gt;, which is comprised of public and private high schools in Mercer, &lt;a href=\"Middlesex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Middlesex&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Monmouth%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Monmouth&lt;/a&gt; counties, operating under the supervision of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20State%20Interscholastic%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (NJSIAA).

W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. The film \"&lt;a href=\"Whiplash%20%282014%20film%29\"&gt;Whiplash&lt;/a&gt;\" is based on writer/director &lt;a href=\"Damien%20Chazelle\"&gt;Damien Chazelle&lt;/a&gt;'s experiences in the band program under Dr. Biancosino.\nJazz Festival.\nThe Princeton High School band program also hosts an annual Jazz Festival, nicknamed \"Jazz Fest\", at which local high school and middle school jazz bands are invited to perform for adjudication. Like many other similar high school jazz festivals, the host band traditionally plays last and is not scored for competition. Each year, the band program invites a guest artist to perform after the festival for its attendees.\nPHS Tiger News.\nTiger News is the school's video-based news source. Its &lt;a href=\"Facebook\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page reads \"Princeton High School's Tiger News meets once a week to film the show, which is broadcast during homeroom every week. With on-scene reports and special segments, Tiger News has quickly become a school hit!\" The program was founded in 2013, and has continued ever since. \nSpectacle Theatre.\nSpectacle Theatre is Princeton High School's student-run drama club. Each year, students will act in and produce a fall play (generally in November) and a spring musical (generally in March). After the conclusion of the musical, seniors have the opportunity to direct single-act plays in a Student Directed Play production. Each production involves tech, make-up, lighting, and costume departments as well as a stage crew.\nThe program was the first high school to premiere \"&lt;a href=\"Brigadoon%20%28musical%29\"&gt;Brigadoon&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Carousel%20%28musical%29\"&gt;Carousel&lt;/a&gt;\". They have also performed operas at Princeton High School, the first of which was \"Cavalleria Rusticana\", a one-act opera written by Pietro Mascagni.\nSpectacle Theatre is currently directed by Pat Wray, the PHS drama teacher and former Broadway dancer and actress.\nSpeech and Debate.\nPrinceton High School has a rich history of success both in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Speech%20and%20Debate%20Association\"&gt;National Speech and Debate Association&lt;/a&gt; (NSDA) and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Catholic%20Forensic%20League\"&gt;National Catholic Forensic League&lt;/a&gt; (NCFL). The school speech &amp; debate team competes in the three largest forms of High School Debate: Public Forum, Lincoln Douglas, and Congressional Debate, as well as a smaller range of speech categories. Debaters in both Public Forum and Lincoln Douglas have qualified to the &lt;a href=\"Tournament%20of%20Champions%20%28debate%29\"&gt;Tournament of Champions&lt;/a&gt;, the NSDA National Tournament, and the NCFL National Tournament.\n\"Spork\".\n\"Spork\" is the school's food and dining &lt;a href=\"magazine\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt;. It was created during the 2011\u201312 school year through funds generating via &lt;a href=\"Kickstarter\"&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. The Spork staff writes and adapts &lt;a href=\"recipes\"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt;, reviews local &lt;a href=\"Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Princeton&lt;/a&gt; restaurants, and publishes food-related features and articles. \"Spork\" is printed and distributed for free in school, in addition to online publication.\nThe Ideas Center.\nThe Princeton High School Ideas Center provides most of the students in need at the school with peer tutors. Tutors work with their fellow students in one-on-one sessions or study groups. Tutoring is often done as a &lt;a href=\"Community%20Service\"&gt;community service&lt;/a&gt; requirement, though this is not always the case.\n\"The Ivy\".\n\"The Ivy \"is the school's visual and literary &lt;a href=\"Art%20magazine\"&gt;arts magazine&lt;/a&gt;. The title of the magazine comes from the &lt;a href=\"ivy\"&gt;ivy&lt;/a&gt; that grows on some of the older school buildings. Student-submitted work is reviewed anonymously, and the staff creates the magazine based on these votes. The magazine is printed and distributed for free in school, in addition to online publication.\n\"The Tower\".\n\"The Tower\" is the school's &lt;a href=\"student%20newspaper\"&gt;newspaper&lt;/a&gt;, which was founded in 1911 as \"The Observer\". In 1925, it was again renamed to \"The Blue &amp; White\", and received its present title in 1929 to commemorate the new high school building, which is presently the oldest building on campus. The first incarnation was published &lt;a href=\"fortnight\"&gt;fortnight&lt;/a&gt;ly in a smaller format, while the current edition is published monthly in a traditional newspaper size. It has been printed and typesetted by various local publishers, including the \"&lt;a href=\"Town%20Topics%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Town Topics&lt;/a&gt;\" and most recently the \"&lt;a href=\"Princeton%20Packet\"&gt;Princeton Packet&lt;/a&gt;\". The newspaper is distributed for free in school, in addition to online publication.\n\"The Tower\" has varied enormously in content and style throughout its publication. The &lt;a href=\"Nameplate%20%28publishing%29\"&gt;nameplate&lt;/a&gt; has changed significantly, with the original pencil drawing of the tower with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\"-style lettering continually removed and reinserted in between redesigns, but the current masthead dates to the eighties. Features in \"The Tower\" include a monthly quotes section, \"Cheers and Jeers\" of various cultural and school-specific events, a two-page topical opinions/forum spread called Vanguard, and a monthly calendar of local events called \"Pencil These In\". Many of these topics have been resurrected from past issue of \"The Tower\". General topics include &lt;a href=\"opinion%20pieces\"&gt;opinion pieces&lt;/a&gt;, arts and entertainment, and sports news. Once a year a joke issue is published, which is a tradition first created in a 1920s issue called \"The Black &amp; Blue\u2014\"more recent examples being a mid-2000s issue alleging that a giant condom had been placed on top of the school and &lt;a href=\"lolcat\"&gt;lolcat&lt;/a&gt;s being featured in a 2009 issue.\n\"The Tower\" has faced competition. From 1990 to 1994, a rival \"underground\" newspaper called \"The Free Press\" published after a split between several potential editors of \"The Tower.\" Currently, an &lt;a href=\"The%20Onion\"&gt;Onion&lt;/a&gt;-style news site called \"The Dungeon\" has been publishing since 2013.\nAchievement gap.\nPrinceton High School has been considered a case study of the &lt;a href=\"achievement%20gap\"&gt;achievement gap&lt;/a&gt; in elite high schools. The gap between different groups in academic progress received greater attention in 2005 after the school failed the &lt;a href=\"No%20Child%20Left%20Behind%20Act\"&gt;No Child Left Behind Act&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" ran an article entitled \"The Achievement Gap in Elite Schools,\" by &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20G.%20Freedman\"&gt;Samuel G. Freedman&lt;/a&gt; on September 28, 2005, which accused PHS of neglecting its responsibility to educate minorities. While the cause may be due to &lt;a href=\"Socioeconomics\"&gt;socioeconomic status&lt;/a&gt; rather than &lt;a href=\"racial%20segregation\"&gt;racial segregation&lt;/a&gt;, many students in the overwhelmingly &lt;a href=\"white%20%28people%29\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;-and-&lt;a href=\"Asian%20people\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt;-populated advanced classes can spend most of their high school career sharing only a few classes with their &lt;a href=\"Hispanic\"&gt;Hispanic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"African%20American\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; peers. According to Freedman's article, \"In the early 1990s, an interracial body calling itself the Robeson Group\u2014in homage to &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Robeson\"&gt;Paul Robeson&lt;/a&gt;, the most famous product of black Princeton\u2014mobilized to recruit more black teachers and help elect the first black member to the school board.\"\nIn 2003, the school became part of the Minority Student Achievement Network, a network of 21 different schools across the country that share Princeton High School's achievement gap problem. MSAN gathers high achieving minority students to address and help fix the growing achievement gap in their schools.\nAdministration.\nThe school's principal is Frank Chmiel. His core administration team includes three assistant principals and the dean of students."
