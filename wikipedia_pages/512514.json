    "text": "The Auschwitz concentration camp complex was a system of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20concentration%20camps\"&gt;concentration camps&lt;/a&gt; (, abbreviated as either \"KL\" or \"KZ\") run by &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;occupied Poland&lt;/a&gt; from 1940 to 1945. The main camp (German: \"Stammlager\") was &lt;a href=\"Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp%23Auschwitz%20I\"&gt;Auschwitz I&lt;/a&gt;. Auschwitz II, or &lt;a href=\"Birkenau\"&gt;Birkenau&lt;/a&gt;, was a concentration and &lt;a href=\"extermination%20camp\"&gt;extermination camp&lt;/a&gt;, and became the most notorious of the camps. Auschwitz III, or &lt;a href=\"Monowitz%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;Monowitz&lt;/a&gt;, was a labour camp.\nIn addition to the three largest camps, Auschwitz consisted of several &lt;a href=\"Subcamp%20%28SS%29\"&gt;subcamps&lt;/a&gt;. The satellite camps were named \"Aussenlager\" (external camp), \"Nebenlager\" (extension or subcamp), and \"Arbeitslager\" (labour camp). Several lay within of the main camp, with prisoner populations ranging from dozens to several thousand.\nKL Auschwitz.\nAdministration.\nAs the size and purpose of Auschwitz changed during World War II, its structure and chain of command changed too. From 1940 to late 1943, Auschwitz I was the \"Stammlager\" and the other camps were subordinate to it. In November 1943 Birkenau and Monowitz became independent camps with their own commandants, although the commandant of Auschwitz I remained the senior officer. Auschwitz I and Birkenau were placed back under one command in November 1944, and Auschwitz III was named Monowitz.\nSubcamps.\nThe known &lt;a href=\"Subcamp%20%28SS%29\"&gt;subcamps&lt;/a&gt; of the Auschwitz complex included:"
