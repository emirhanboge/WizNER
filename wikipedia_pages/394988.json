    "text": "Black Kettle (&lt;a href=\"Cheyenne%20language\"&gt;Cheyenne&lt;/a&gt;: Mo'ohtavetoo'o) (c. 1803November 27, 1868) was a prominent leader of the &lt;a href=\"Cheyenne\"&gt;Southern Cheyenne&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Indian%20Wars\"&gt;American Indian Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Born to the \"Northern S\u00f3'taeo'o / S\u00f3'ta\u00e9taneo'o\" band of the Northern Cheyenne in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hills\"&gt;Black Hills&lt;/a&gt; of present-day &lt;a href=\"South%20Dakota\"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, he later married into the \"Wot\u00e1pio / Wutapai\" band (one mixed Cheyenne-&lt;a href=\"Kiowa\"&gt;Kiowa&lt;/a&gt; band with &lt;a href=\"Lakota%20Sioux\"&gt;Lakota Sioux&lt;/a&gt; origin) of the Southern Cheyenne.\nBlack Kettle is often remembered as a peacemaker who accepted treaties with the U.S. government to protect his people. On November 27, 1868, while attempting to escape the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Washita%20River\"&gt;Battle of Washita River&lt;/a&gt; with his wife, he was shot and killed by soldiers of the U.S. &lt;a href=\"7th%20Cavalry%20Regiment\"&gt;7th Cavalry&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nBlack Kettle was born around 1803 in South Dakota into the Cheyenne Nation. Little is known of Black Kettle's life prior to 1854, when he was made a chief of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Forty-four\"&gt;Council of Forty-four&lt;/a&gt;, the central government of the &lt;a href=\"Cheyenne\"&gt;Cheyenne&lt;/a&gt; tribe. The Council met regularly at the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Dance\"&gt;Sun Dance&lt;/a&gt; gatherings, where they affirmed unity.\nAfter 1851, relations between the Cheyenne and the U.S. government were nominally conducted under the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Laramie%20%281851%29\"&gt;Treaty of Fort Laramie&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the U.S. government remained unwilling to control white expansion into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Plains\"&gt;Great Plains&lt;/a&gt;, particularly after the &lt;a href=\"Pike%27s%20Peak%20Gold%20Rush\"&gt;Pike's Peak Gold Rush&lt;/a&gt; began in 1859. &lt;a href=\"European%20American\"&gt;European American&lt;/a&gt;s displaced the Cheyenne from their lands in violation of the treaty, and consumed important resources of water and game. Increasing competition eventually led to armed conflict between the groups.\nChief Black Kettle was a pragmatist who believed that U.S. military power and the number of immigrants were overwhelming and unable to be resisted. In 1861, he and the &lt;a href=\"Arapaho\"&gt;Arapaho&lt;/a&gt; surrendered to the commander of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Lyon\"&gt;Fort Lyon&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Wise\"&gt;Treaty of Fort Wise&lt;/a&gt;, believing he could gain protection for his people. The treaty was highly unfavorable to the Southern Cheyenne. Black Kettle visited &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, where President &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Lincoln\"&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; gave him a large American flag.\nThe Cheyenne led their bands to the Sand Creek reservation, which occupied a small corner of southeastern &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Territory\"&gt;Colorado Territory&lt;/a&gt; about 40 miles from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Lyon\"&gt;Fort Lyon&lt;/a&gt;. The land was not arable and was located far away from &lt;a href=\"American%20bison\"&gt;buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, their major source of meat. Many Cheyenne warriors, including the &lt;a href=\"Dog%20Soldiers\"&gt;Dog Soldiers&lt;/a&gt;, did not accept the treaty and began to attack white settlers. Whether Black Kettle opposed these actions, tolerated them, or encouraged them remains controversial among historians.\nColorado War.\nBy the summer of 1864, the situation had reached a boiling point. Southern Cheyenne hardliners, along with allied &lt;a href=\"Kiowa\"&gt;Kiowa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arapaho\"&gt;Arapaho&lt;/a&gt; bands, raided American settlements for livestock and supplies. Sometimes they took captives, generally only women and children, to adopt into their tribes as replacements for lost members. On June 11, 1864, indigenous people killed a family of settlers, an attack which the white people called the &lt;a href=\"Hungate%20massacre\"&gt;Hungate massacre&lt;/a&gt; after the family. Pro-war white people displayed the scalped bodies in &lt;a href=\"Denver%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;. Colorado governor &lt;a href=\"John%20Evans%20%28Colorado%20governor%29\"&gt;John Evans&lt;/a&gt; believed tribal chiefs had ordered the attack and were intent on a full-scale war.\nEvans issued a proclamation ordering all \"Friendly Indians of the Plains\" to report to military posts or be considered \"hostile\". He sought and gained from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20War\"&gt;War Department&lt;/a&gt; authorization to establish the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Colorado%20Cavalry\"&gt;Third Colorado Cavalry&lt;/a&gt;. Colonel &lt;a href=\"John%20M.%20Chivington\"&gt;John M. Chivington&lt;/a&gt; led the unit, composed predominantly of \"100-daysers\", who enlisted for limited 100-day terms specifically for fighting against the Cheyenne and Arapaho.\nBlack Kettle decided to accept Evans' offer and entered negotiations. On September 28, he concluded a peace settlement at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Weld\"&gt;Fort Weld&lt;/a&gt; outside Denver. The agreement assigned the Southern Cheyenne to the Sand Creek reservation and required them to report to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Lyon\"&gt;Fort Lyon&lt;/a&gt;, formerly Fort Wise. Black Kettle believed the agreement would ensure the safety of his people. After he went to the reservation, the commanding officer at the fort was replaced by one who was an ally of Chivington.\nBetrayal at Sand Creek.\nAmbitious, Chivington felt pressure from Governor Evans to make use of the Third Colorado Cavalry before their terms expired at the end of 1864. On November 28, Chivington arrived with 700 men at Fort Lyon. According to an eyewitness, John S. Smith:\n[H]e stopped all persons from going on ahead of him. He stopped the mail, and would not allow any person to go on ahead of him at the time he was on his way from Denver city to Fort Lyon. He placed a guard around old Colonel Bent, the former agent there; he stopped a Mr. Hagues and many men who were on their way to Fort Lyon. He took the fort by surprise, and as soon as he got there he posted pickets all around the fort, and then left at 8 o'clock that night for this Indian camp. \nAt dawn on November 29, Chivington attacked the Sand Creek reservation; the event became known as the &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Creek%20massacre\"&gt;Sand Creek massacre&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the warriors were out hunting. Following Indian agent instructions, Black Kettle flew an &lt;a href=\"American%20flag\"&gt;American flag&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"white%20flag\"&gt;white flag&lt;/a&gt; from his &lt;a href=\"tipi\"&gt;tipi&lt;/a&gt;, but the signal was ignored. The 3rd Colorado Cavalry killed 163 Cheyenne by shooting or stabbing. They burned down the village encampment. Most of the victims were women and children. For months afterward, members of the militia displayed trophies in Denver of their battle, including body parts they had taken for souvenirs.\nAftermath.\nBlack Kettle escaped the massacre and returned to rescue his severely injured wife, who suffered nine bullet and shrapnel wounds. He continued to counsel pacifism, believing that military resistance was doomed to fail. The majority of the Southern Cheyenne chiefs disagreed. Allied with the &lt;a href=\"Comanche\"&gt;Comanche&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kiowa\"&gt;Kiowa&lt;/a&gt;, they went to war against U.S. civilians and military forces.\nBlack Kettle said of that time:\nBlack Kettle moved south and continued to negotiate with U.S. officials. He signed the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Arkansas%20Treaty\"&gt;Treaty of Little Arkansas River&lt;/a&gt; on October 14, 1865. By this document, the U.S. promised \"perpetual peace\" and lands in reparation for the Sand Creek massacre. However, its practical effect was to dispossess the Cheyenne yet again and require them to move to &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Territory\"&gt;Indian Territory&lt;/a&gt; (present-day &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;). Black Kettle's influence continued to wane. &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Nose\"&gt;Roman Nose&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Dog%20Soldiers\"&gt;Dog Soldiers&lt;/a&gt; took a prevailing hard line and continued warfare.\nMedicine Lodge Treaty.\nBlack Kettle's dwindling band proclaimed their desire to live peacefully alongside European Americans. Black Kettle signed yet another treaty, the &lt;a href=\"Medicine%20Lodge%20Treaty\"&gt;Medicine Lodge Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, on October 28, 1867. The Dog Soldiers continued their raids and ambushes across Kansas, Texas, and Colorado.\nThe relationship between the two groups is a subject of historical dispute. According to &lt;a href=\"Little%20Rock%20%28Cheyenne%20chief%29\"&gt;Little Rock&lt;/a&gt;, second-in-command of Black Kettle's village, most of the warriors came back to Black Kettle's camp after their attacks. White prisoners, including children, were held within his encampment. By this time Black Kettle's influence was waning, and it is unclear whether he could have stopped the younger warriors' actions.\nBattle of Washita River.\nIn response to the continued raids and massacres, General &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Sheridan\"&gt;Philip Sheridan&lt;/a&gt; devised a plan of punitive reprisals. He planned to attack Cheyenne winter encampments, destroying both supplies and livestock, and killing any people who resisted. At dawn on the morning of November 27, 1868 (just two days short of the fourth anniversary of the Sand Creek massacre), Lieutenant Colonel &lt;a href=\"George%20Armstrong%20Custer\"&gt;George Armstrong Custer&lt;/a&gt; led his &lt;a href=\"7th%20Cavalry%20Regiment\"&gt;7th Cavalry Regiment&lt;/a&gt; to attack Chief Black Kettle and his village along the &lt;a href=\"Washita%20River\"&gt;Washita River&lt;/a&gt; in what is now western &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. Custer's troops killed more than 100 Native Americans, mostly Southern Cheyenne. While trying to cross the Washita River, Black Kettle and his wife were shot in the back and killed.\nAccording to Cheyenne oral tradition, a survivor of Washita, Meotzi/Monahseetah (&lt;a href=\"Mo-nah-se-tah\"&gt;Mo-nah-se-tah&lt;/a&gt;), who had a son, Yellow Swallow, by Custer was said to be Black Kettle's daughter, although in fact Mo-nah-se-tah was the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Little%20Rock%20%28Cheyenne%20chief%29\"&gt;Little Rock&lt;/a&gt; and not Black Kettle.\nLegacy.\nThe Cheyenne have recognized Black Kettle as a peacemaker. &lt;a href=\"Black%20Kettle%20National%20Grassland\"&gt;Black Kettle National Grassland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Mills%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Roger Mills County, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hemphill%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Hemphill County, Texas&lt;/a&gt; is named for him. Near the site of his death, in present-day &lt;a href=\"Cheyenne%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Cheyenne, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Kettle Museum commemorates his legacy.\nIn popular culture.\nBlack Kettle was a recurring character in the CBS family drama \"&lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Quinn%2C%20Medicine%20Woman\"&gt;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&lt;/a&gt;\" for its first three seasons, played by &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Ramus\"&gt;Nick Ramus&lt;/a&gt;. Black Kettle plays a key role for the series in the pilot episode. Dr. Quinn saves Black Kettle's life by performing a &lt;a href=\"tracheotomy\"&gt;tracheotomy&lt;/a&gt; and removing a bullet lodged in his neck. She later receives a Cheyenne name from Black Kettle meaning \"Medicine Woman\".\nOn &lt;a href=\"ska\"&gt;ska&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Five%20Iron%20Frenzy\"&gt;Five Iron Frenzy&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Our%20Newest%20Album%20Ever%21\"&gt;Our Newest Album Ever!&lt;/a&gt;\", the song \"Banner Year\" is about Black Kettle, how he was betrayed, and his eventual murder at the hands of Custer.\nBlack Kettle and the fate of his village are featured in Episode 4 of TNT miniseries \"&lt;a href=\"Into%20the%20West%20%28miniseries%29\"&gt;Into the West&lt;/a&gt;\". Black Kettle is portrayed by &lt;a href=\"Wes%20Studi\"&gt;Wes Studi&lt;/a&gt;."
