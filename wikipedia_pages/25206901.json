    "text": "J\u00f5hvi FC Phoenix is an Estonian &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B5hvi\"&gt;J\u00f5hvi&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe club was founded as J\u00f5hvi FC Lokomotiv in 2011 on the basis of former football club J\u00f5hvi JK Orbiit. They finished the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Esiliiga\"&gt;2013 season&lt;/a&gt; as Esiliiga runners-up and were promoted to the Estonian top division for the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Meistriliiga\"&gt;2014 season&lt;/a&gt;. They were relegated after a single season, being defeated in the relegation play-offs by &lt;a href=\"Viljandi%20JK%20Tulevik\"&gt;Viljandi Tulevik&lt;/a&gt;. Due to financial problems, the club was initially relegated to the fourth level for 2015 and after two seasons on lower levels, their players joined &lt;a href=\"Kohtla-J%C3%A4rve%20JK%20J%C3%A4rve\"&gt;Kohtla-J\u00e4rve JK J\u00e4rve&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. In 2018, the club was renamed to J\u00f5hvi FC Phoenix and currently only employs youth players."
