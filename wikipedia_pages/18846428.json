In Biology I, 75% of pupils demonstrated on grade level science understanding at the end of the Biology course. The requirement that pupils pass the Keystone Exams in reading, algebra I and bIology I in order to graduate was postponed until 2019 by the Pennsylvania General Assembly because less than 60% of 12 grade pupils statewide would have been eligible for graduation from high school due to failing one or more Keystone Exams.

Effective with Spring 2013, the Pennsylvania Department of Education discontinued administering the PSSA's to 11th graders.\n&lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20System%20of%20School%20Assessment\"&gt;Pennsylvania System of School Assessment&lt;/a&gt;s, commonly called PSSAs are No Child Left Behind Act related examinations which were administered from 2003 through 2012, in all Pennsylvania public high schools. The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, &lt;a href=\"geometry\"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trigonometry\"&gt;trigonometry&lt;/a&gt;. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.\nIn 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the applicable course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year. The state announced the change in 2010 and made it in order to comply with Governor Edward G. Rendell's agreement to change to the national Common Core standards.\n11th Grade Reading:\n11th Grade Math:\n11th Grade Science:\nScience in Motion Dallas High School took advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate. &lt;a href=\"Wilkes%20University\"&gt;Wilkes University&lt;/a&gt; provided the science enrichment experiences to schools in the region.\nCollege Remediation Rate.\nAccording to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 23% of Dallas High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20State%20System%20of%20Higher%20Education\"&gt;Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education&lt;/a&gt; or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.\nDual enrollment.\nDallas High School offers a &lt;a href=\"dual%20enrollment\"&gt;dual enrollment&lt;/a&gt; program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are home schooled are eligible to participate in this program. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. For the 2009-10 funding year, Dallas High School received a state grant of $9,012 for the program. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students.\nGraduation requirements.\nAmong Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts, graduation requirements widely vary. The Dallas School Board has determined that a pupil must take a required classes in: math, English, social studies, science, Physical Education and electives for a total of 25 credits. The high school was not one of 37 Pennsylvania public high schools that require students take a personal finance course in order to graduate in 2012. The school board requires students to pass a Career and Consumer Science course in order to be awarded a diploma.\nSince 1984, all Pennsylvania secondary school students were required to complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.\nBy Pennsylvania State School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2019, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in &lt;a href=\"Algebra\"&gt;Algebra&lt;/a&gt; I, &lt;a href=\"Biology\"&gt;Biology&lt;/a&gt;, and English Literature by passing the respective Keystone Exams for each course. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams have replaced the PSSAs for 11th grade.\nStudents have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements. In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their Individual Education Plan regardless of their Keystone Exam results.\nSAT scores.\nIn 2015, 167 Dallas School District students took the &lt;a href=\"SAT\"&gt;SAT&lt;/a&gt; exams.

At Dallas High School 79% of the students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam in 2016.\nClassrooms for the Future grant.\nThe Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. Dallas high School applied for funding in 2006\u201307, but was denied by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. In 2007\u201308, it received $263,298. The high school received $47,989 in 2008-09 for a total funding of $311,287.\nSchool safety and bullying.\nThe Dallas High School administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the school in 2015. Additionally, there were no weapons incidents and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in zero incidents at the schools. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school.\nThe Dallas School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works with the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Commission%20on%20Crime%20%26amp%3B%20Delinquency\"&gt;Pennsylvania Commission on Crime &amp; Delinquency&lt;/a&gt; and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. According to the &lt;a href=\"Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention\"&gt;Center for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s biannual national study of high school students in 2009, five percent of Pennsylvania students did not go to school for at least one day because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to or from school.\nEducation standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.\nSchool Resource Officer and Police Officer grant.\nIn 2014, Pennsylvania began a grant program providing funding for programs to address school violence and security. Eligible schools and municipalities could apply for up to $60,000 for a school resource officer and up to $40,000 for a school police officer. Dallas School District applied and was awarded $58,000.\nSafe School grant.\nIn 2013 and 2014, Dallas School District did not participate in a state Safe Schools Targeted Grant. The maximum of $25,000 grants were awarded through a competitive application process. The funds must be used for research based interventions, like: peer mediation, staff training in managing behavioral issues and creating a positive school climate.\nWellness policy.\nDallas School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 \u2013 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the &lt;a href=\"Richard%20B.%20Russell%20National%20School%20Lunch%20Act\"&gt;Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act&lt;/a&gt; (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the &lt;a href=\"Child%20Nutrition%20Act\"&gt;Child Nutrition Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation.\nThe legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval.\nDallas High School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals. The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture\"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20D\"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. In order to comply with the &lt;a href=\"Healthy%2C%20Hunger-Free%20Kids%20Act%20of%202010\"&gt;Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010&lt;/a&gt; all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non-subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2015, federal reimbursement rates were: $3.07 per meal for students who are income-eligible for free lunches and $2.67 for those who qualify for a reduced price. School lunch participation nationally dropped from 31.6 million students in 2012 to 30.4 million in 2014, according to the federal Department of Agriculture. Pennsylvania statistics show school lunch participation dropped by 86,950 students in the same two years, from 1,127,444 in 2012 to 1,040,494 in 2014.\nIn 2014, President &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day.\nThe United States Department of Agriculture requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk.\nDallas High School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse is available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight.\nIn 2016, the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Health\"&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; made available to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug &lt;a href=\"naloxone\"&gt;naloxone&lt;/a&gt; in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Association%20of%20School%20Nurses\"&gt;National Association of School Nurses&lt;/a&gt;. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation.\nExtracurriculars.\nThe Dallas School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, publicly funded sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Interscholastic%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (PIAA). The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full-credit subjects to participate in sports.\nBy Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the school district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, a Pennsylvania public cyber charter school, charter school and those who are homeschooled, are all eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.\nAccording to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.\nAthletics.\nCoaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract. When athletic competition exceeds the regular season, additional compensation is paid. The district is noncompliant with state law, due to failing to post its Interscholastic Athletic Opportunities Disclosure Form on its website. Article XVI-C of the Public School Code requires the disclosure of interscholastic athletic opportunities for all public secondary school entities in Pennsylvania. All school entities with grades 7-12 are required to annually collect data concerning team and financial information for all male and female athletes beginning with the 2012\u201313 school year and submit the information to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Beginning with the 2013\u201314 school year, all non-school (booster club and alumni) contributions and purchases must also be reported to PDE.\nAccording to Pennsylvania's Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the &lt;a href=\"Concussion\"&gt;Concussion&lt;/a&gt; Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching.\nThe district funds:\nAccording to PIAA directory July 2016\nDallas High School has won &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Interscholastic%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;PIAA&lt;/a&gt; State Championships in &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; (1993), girls' &lt;a href=\"Cross%20country%20running\"&gt;cross country&lt;/a&gt; (2003, 2005, 2014), boys cross country (2015, 2016), girls' &lt;a href=\"soccer\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; (2007), and men's diving (2005, 2006).
