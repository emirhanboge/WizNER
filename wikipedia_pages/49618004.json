Philpott was impressed with his performance after noticing him at the New Zealand under-20 trial camps. He made his debut for the province in 2015, playing the two out of the three pre-season &lt;a href=\"Ranfurly%20Shield\"&gt;Ranfurly Shield&lt;/a&gt; matches against &lt;a href=\"Horowhenua-Kapiti%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Horowhenua-Kapiti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Canterbury%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Mid Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;. He made a further six appearances during the &lt;a href=\"2015%20ITM%20Cup\"&gt;2015 ITM Cup&lt;/a&gt; season.\nRiccitelli then joined the &lt;a href=\"Hurricanes%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; after being called up into the squad to replace the injured &lt;a href=\"Dane%20Coles\"&gt;Dane Coles&lt;/a&gt;. He made his &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt; debut in the squads 23-man team to play the &lt;a href=\"Brumbies\"&gt;Brumbies&lt;/a&gt; in their season opener. He then had his short-term injury cover contract with the Hurricanes extended after his work ethic impressed the coaching staff. After the Hurricanes' success throughout the season, Riccitelli appeared in all three finals, including their &lt;a href=\"2016%20Super%20Rugby%20Final\"&gt;grand final&lt;/a&gt; win over the &lt;a href=\"Lions%20%28Super%20Rugby%29\"&gt;Lions&lt;/a&gt;, impressing the Hurricanes' coaches with his accurate lineout throwing and strong ball-carrying.\nIn 2016 also saw Riccitelli feature in a disappointing Hawke's Bay team that finished in last place. He continued to make progress though as a starting loosehead prop during their Mitre 10 Cup campaign. Riccitelli, returned to his primary and preferred role of hooker when the side hosted &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Plenty%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Bay of Plenty&lt;/a&gt;, which was their final outing of the season at Napier's &lt;a href=\"McLean%20Park\"&gt;McLean Park&lt;/a&gt;. He extended his club's appearances to eighteen after he played in all ten of Hawke's Bay's matches, making it a season's personal best.\nRiccitelli returned to his home province of Taranaki. Having already secured &lt;a href=\"Jordie%20Barrett\"&gt;Jordie Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, Taranaki had lured Riccitelli for the 2017 and 2018 Mitre 10 Cup season's, him to signing a two-year deal. With hooker &lt;a href=\"Rhys%20Marshall\"&gt;Rhys Marshall&lt;/a&gt; taking up an offer to play for &lt;a href=\"Munster%20Rugby\"&gt;Munster&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the previous season, coach &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Cooper%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;Colin Cooper&lt;/a&gt; said Riccitelli had a chance to claim the vacant hooker position.\nRiccitelli became a regular starter for the Hurricanes in the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Super%20Rugby%20season\"&gt;2017 Super Rugby season&lt;/a&gt; after another injury to Hurricanes' captain and first-choice &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; hooker Dane Coles. He was preferred over &lt;a href=\"Leni%20Apisai\"&gt;Leni Apisai&lt;/a&gt; for the role. Riccitelli was eventually called up as injury cover for the All Blacks' &lt;a href=\"2017%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;2017 Rugby Championship&lt;/a&gt;, with Coles out of the first round and &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Coltman\"&gt;Liam Coltman&lt;/a&gt; out for the season.

He started in all thirteen matches for the Hurricanes, played the third-most minutes for the side and made the second-most tackles before earning his second call-up for the New Zealand national team. Riccitelli was brought in as backup for &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Harris%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Nathan Harris&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the third test against &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dunedin%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Dunedin&lt;/a&gt;.\nRiccitelli returned for his second &lt;a href=\"Mitre%2010%20Cup\"&gt;Mitre 10 Cup&lt;/a&gt; season with Taranaki after being included in their 47-man squad to defend the &lt;a href=\"Ranfurly%20Shield\"&gt;Ranfurly Shield&lt;/a&gt;. He was named player of the year for the province after appearing in nine out of twelve matches during the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Mitre%2010%20Cup\"&gt;2018 campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Riccitelli later gained selection honours with &lt;a href=\"Robbie%20Deans\"&gt;Robbie Deans&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"World%20XV\"&gt;World XV&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Japan%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Osaka\"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt; after being named among the ten replacements. The side also featured current New Zealand internationals &lt;a href=\"Nehe%20Milner-Skudder\"&gt;Nehe Milner-Skudder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jackson%20Hemopo\"&gt;Jackson Hemopo&lt;/a&gt;.\nRiccitelli rejoined the Hurricanes squad for their upcoming season after head coach &lt;a href=\"John%20Plumtree\"&gt;John Plumtree&lt;/a&gt; included him in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Super%20Rugby%20season\"&gt;2019 Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt; side announcement in October 2018. He made his first appearance of 2019 against the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs\"&gt;Waratahs&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Brookvale%20Oval\"&gt;Brookvale Oval&lt;/a&gt; on 16 February. Riccitelli made his 50th appearance for the Hurricanes franchise alongside &lt;a href=\"Vaea%20Fifita\"&gt;Vaea Fifita&lt;/a&gt; after being named to start the match at &lt;a href=\"Westpac%20Stadium\"&gt;Westpac Stadium&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt;."
