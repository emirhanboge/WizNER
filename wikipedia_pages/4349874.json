    "text": "Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz Ramos (3 May 1895 \u2013 19 March 1942) was a Spanish &lt;a href=\"trade%20union\"&gt;trade union&lt;/a&gt;ist and &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; politician. He was the General Secretary of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Communist Party of Spain&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrade unionism.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Sevilla\"&gt;Sevilla&lt;/a&gt; and a baker by trade since age eleven, at 18 joined La Aurora, the Union of Seville bakers, who soon after joined the anarchist &lt;a href=\"Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo\"&gt;Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo&lt;/a&gt;. He became known as the leader of a &lt;a href=\"Strike%20action\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; in 1917 and in 1920 participated in the general strike called by the leadership of the CNT, which ended in failure. After the start of &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Primo%20de%20Rivera\"&gt;Miguel Primo de Rivera&lt;/a&gt;'s dictatorship, D\u00edaz continued his labor activism in clandestinity being arrested in Madrid in 1925. In 1927, already out of jail, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Spain%20%28main%29\"&gt;Communist Party of Spain&lt;/a&gt; (PCE) with much of the leaders of Seville anarchism. He was able to attract the more radical workers, who were disenchanted with the traditional unions, as well as helping the PCE profit from rivalry between the &lt;a href=\"Socialism\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uni%C3%B3n%20General%20de%20Trabajadores\"&gt;Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Anarchism%20in%20Spain\"&gt;anarchist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo\"&gt;Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeadership in Spain.\nIn 1932 the Spanish Communist Party made a major change in direction when it abandoned the Comintern slogan \"Workers' and Peasants' Government\" and adopted \"Defense of the Republic\".\nD\u00edaz was among the new leaders of the party who succeeded &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Bullejos\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Bullejos&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe others were &lt;a href=\"Vicente%20Uribe\"&gt;Vicente Uribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Mije\"&gt;Antonio Mije&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Astigarrab%C3%ADa\"&gt;Juan Astigarrab\u00eda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jes%C3%BAs%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20Tom%C3%A1s\"&gt;Jes\u00fas Hern\u00e1ndez Tom\u00e1s&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 4th PCE Congress in Sevilla (March 1932) elected him a member of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee\"&gt;Central Committee&lt;/a&gt;; in September of the same year, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Politburo\"&gt;Politburo&lt;/a&gt;, and soon after was appointed &lt;a href=\"general%20secretary\"&gt;general secretary&lt;/a&gt;. In this capacity, D\u00edaz was replacing &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Bullejos\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Bullejos&lt;/a&gt;, who had been expelled for opposing the official &lt;a href=\"Party%20line%20%28politics%29\"&gt;party line&lt;/a&gt; during a \"&lt;a href=\"Bolshevism\"&gt;campaign of Bolshevisation&lt;/a&gt;\" that enforced &lt;a href=\"Stalinism\"&gt;Stalinism&lt;/a&gt; as the official &lt;a href=\"Marxism-Leninism\"&gt;Marxism-Leninism&lt;/a&gt;. In 1935, he and &lt;a href=\"Dolores%20Ib%C3%A1rruri\"&gt;Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri&lt;/a&gt; led the PCE delegation to the 7th &lt;a href=\"Comintern\"&gt;Comintern&lt;/a&gt; Congress, where &lt;a href=\"Georgi%20Dimitrov\"&gt;Georgi Dimitrov&lt;/a&gt; introduced the politic of \"&lt;a href=\"Popular%20Front\"&gt;united front&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Fascism\"&gt;Fascism&lt;/a&gt;\", which signaled world communists to seek an alliance with movements previously considered &lt;a href=\"bourgeois\"&gt;bourgeois&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith PCE participation in the &lt;a href=\"Popular%20Front%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Spanish Popular Front&lt;/a&gt; government and the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, D\u00edaz dedicated himself to inner party politics, without occupying official positions in the administration of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Spanish%20Republic\"&gt;Second Spanish Republic&lt;/a&gt;. His focus was on contributing to the military victory of the Republican forces over &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Franco\"&gt;Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt;'s troops, and was a noted critic of &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Domingo%20Astigarrabia\"&gt;Juan Domingo Astigarrabia&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Euskadi\"&gt;Communist Party of Euskadi&lt;/a&gt; (the PCE wing in the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque Country&lt;/a&gt;), whom he saw as too sympathetic to &lt;a href=\"Basque%20nationalism\"&gt;Basque nationalism&lt;/a&gt;. His sister Carmen D\u00edaz and the mother of his daughter, Teresa Santos, were killed in Seville at the orders of General &lt;a href=\"Gonzalo%20Queipo%20de%20Llano\"&gt;Gonzalo Queipo de Llano&lt;/a&gt;, in the early days of the war.\nIn the Soviet Union.\nDiaz's health deteriorated due to &lt;a href=\"stomach%20cancer\"&gt;stomach cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and he left Spain for the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; in January 1939, being operated on in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Leningrad&lt;/a&gt;. He remained in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; after the Republican defeat and the start of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, being active as a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20revolutionaries\"&gt;cadre&lt;/a&gt; in the Comintern Secretariat (an overseer of communists in Spain, &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British India&lt;/a&gt;). D\u00edaz also wrote an essay containing &lt;a href=\"self-criticism\"&gt;self-criticism&lt;/a&gt;, one prompted by the ideological demands of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Purge\"&gt;Great Purge&lt;/a&gt; and Stalin's &lt;a href=\"personality%20cult\"&gt;personality cult&lt;/a&gt;, entitled \"Las ense\u00f1anzas de Stalin, gu\u00eda luminoso para los comunistas espa\u00f1oles\" (\"The Teachings of Stalin, a Luminous Guide for the Spanish Communists\"). The articles he wrote in the period were collected as \"Tres a\u00f1os de lucha\" (\"Three Years of Combat\").\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; forces &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Barbarossa\"&gt;invaded the Soviet state&lt;/a&gt; in June 1941, Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz was forced to take refuge in &lt;a href=\"Pushkin%20%28town%29\"&gt;Pushkin&lt;/a&gt;. In autumn, he settled in &lt;a href=\"Tbilisi\"&gt;Tbilisi&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Georgian%20SSR\"&gt;Georgian SSR&lt;/a&gt;) but his ailment and the immense pain it caused him to take his own life that spring. The circumstances of his death have been disputed ever since, with many believing that he had actually been murdered on Stalin's orders. Notably, the stance D\u00edaz had taken in 1939, when he asked for the PCE to be given full control over the Republican government, went clearly (albeit perhaps unwittingly) against the Stalinist strategy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"KGB\"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; file concerning him was &lt;a href=\"Classified%20information\"&gt;declassified&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s (after the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985-1991%29\"&gt;fall of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;): it failed to provide any evidence incriminating Stalin's government. D\u00edaz was replaced as general secretary by &lt;a href=\"Dolores%20Ib%C3%A1rruri\"&gt;Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri&lt;/a&gt;.\nJos\u00e9 D\u00edaz was initially buried in Tbilisi's Vake Cemetery, where a tomb monument authored by the Georgian sculptor Moris Talakvadze was installed. The statue disappeared in the early 1990s and only a tombstone has survived. In April 2005, Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz's remains were reburied in Seville, and the PCE honored his memory with a ceremonial; the city's &lt;a href=\"Ayuntamiento\"&gt;Ayuntamiento&lt;/a&gt; unanimously voted to designate him \"Hijo predilecto\" (\"Favorite son\")."
