Previously it was named H\u00e6rmuseet, \"The Army Museum\" (even earlier the Artillery Museum), therefore, the museum consists of mostly army materiel. The Armed Forces Museum is the main museum sorting under the Norwegian Armed Forces Museum superstructure.\nThe museum's history and focus.\nThe museum was created in 1946 when two former military museums were merged, the &lt;a href=\"Artillery\"&gt;Artillery&lt;/a&gt; Museum (established in 1860) and the &lt;a href=\"Intendant\"&gt;Intendant&lt;/a&gt; Museum (created in 1928), under the name H\u00e6rmus\u00e9et. At first the museum was open only to military personnel, but was opened to the public in 1978 by &lt;a href=\"King%20Olav%20V\"&gt;King Olav V&lt;/a&gt; under the name of the Armed Forces Museum. The museum is located inside the Castle Square, in one of the old military &lt;a href=\"arsenal\"&gt;arsenal&lt;/a&gt;s from the 1860s. The main purpose of the museum is to show the Norwegian military history from the &lt;a href=\"Viking%20Age\"&gt;Viking Age&lt;/a&gt; to the present, and the museum consists of six departments:\nIn addition, there are periods of special exhibitions.\nIn addition to promoting Norwegian military history (especially for school groups), the museum's mission is to be the main military museum."
