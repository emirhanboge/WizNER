    "text": "Perk\u016bnas (, , &lt;a href=\"Old%20Prussian\"&gt;Old Prussian&lt;/a&gt;: \"Perk\u016bns\", \"Perkunos\", &lt;a href=\"Sudovian%20language\"&gt;Yotvingian&lt;/a&gt;: \"Parkuns\", &lt;a href=\"Latgalian%20language\"&gt;Latgalian&lt;/a&gt;: \"P\u0101rkiu\u0146s\") was the common &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20languages\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20thunder%20gods\"&gt;god of thunder&lt;/a&gt;, and the second most important deity in the Baltic &lt;a href=\"Pantheon%20%28gods%29\"&gt;pantheon&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Dievas\"&gt;Dievas&lt;/a&gt;. In both &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20mythology\"&gt;Lithuanian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20mythology\"&gt;Latvian mythology&lt;/a&gt;, he is documented as the god of sky, thunder, &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;, storms, rain, fire, war, law, order, fertility, mountains, and &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; trees.\nEtymology.\nThe name continues &lt;a href=\"PIE\"&gt;PIE&lt;/a&gt; \"*\", cognate to \"*\", a word for \"oak\", \"&lt;a href=\"fir\"&gt;fir&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"wooded mountain\". The Proto-Baltic name *\"Perk\u016bnas\" can be reconstructed with certainty. Slavic &lt;a href=\"Perun\"&gt;Perun&lt;/a&gt; is a related god, but not an etymologically precise match. &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20people\"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Perkele\"&gt;Perkele&lt;/a&gt;, a name of &lt;a href=\"Ukko\"&gt;Ukko&lt;/a&gt;, is considered a loan from Baltic.\nAnother connection is that of \"terpikeraunos\", an epithet of &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; meaning \"who enjoys lightning\".\nPerk\u016bnas in written sources.\nMost information about Perk\u016bnas comes from &lt;a href=\"folklore\"&gt;folklore&lt;/a&gt; songs, legends, and fairy tales. Because most of them were collected rather late in the 19th century, they represent only some fragments of the whole mythology. Lithuanian Perk\u016bnas has many alternative &lt;a href=\"onomatopoeic\"&gt;onomatopoeic&lt;/a&gt; names, like Dundulis, Dindutis, D\u016bd\u0173 senis, Tar\u0161kulis, Tar\u0161kutis, Blizgulis, etc.\nThe earliest attestation of Perk\u016bnas seems to be in the Russian translation of the \"Chronicle of &lt;a href=\"John%20Malalas\"&gt;John Malalas&lt;/a&gt;\" (1261) where it speaks about the worship of \"\u041f\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0443\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0448\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0443\", and in the \"&lt;a href=\"Livonian%20Rhymed%20Chronicle\"&gt;Livonian Rhymed Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\" (around 1290) which mentions the idol Perk\u016bn\u0117.\nIn the \"Constitutiones Synodales\" (1530) Perk\u016bnas is mentioned in a list of gods before the god of hell \"Pikuls\" and is identified with the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20mythology\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jove\"&gt;Jove&lt;/a&gt; (Jupiter). In the \"&lt;a href=\"Sudovian%20Book\"&gt;Sudovian Book&lt;/a&gt;\" Perk\u016bnas (Parkuns) is mentioned in connection with a ritual involving a goat. In &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; compositions, Perk\u016bnas is a malicious spirit, a demon, as in the \"Chronicle of John Malalas\" or in the 15th century writings of Polish chronicler &lt;a href=\"Jan%20D%C5%82ugosz\"&gt;Jan D\u0142ugosz&lt;/a&gt;.\nRepresentation in mythology.\nPerk\u016bnas is the god of lightning and thunder and storms. In a &lt;a href=\"Triple%20deity\"&gt;triad&lt;/a&gt; of gods Perk\u016bnas symbolizes the creative forces (including &lt;a href=\"vegetation\"&gt;vegetative&lt;/a&gt;), courage, success, the top of the world, the sky, rain, thunder, heavenly fire (lightning) and &lt;a href=\"Sky\"&gt;celestial&lt;/a&gt; elements, while &lt;a href=\"Potrimpo\"&gt;Potrimpo&lt;/a&gt; is involved with the seas, ground, crops, and &lt;a href=\"cereal\"&gt;cereal&lt;/a&gt;s and Velnias/&lt;a href=\"Patulas\"&gt;Patulas&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"hell\"&gt;hell&lt;/a&gt;, and death. As a heavenly (atmospheric) deity Perk\u016bnas, apparently, is the assistant and executor of &lt;a href=\"Dievas\"&gt;Dievas&lt;/a&gt;\u2018s will. However, Perk\u016bnas tends to surpass Dievas, \"&lt;a href=\"deus%20otiosus\"&gt;deus otiosus&lt;/a&gt;\", because he can be actually seen and has defined mythological functions. \nIn the Latvian \"dainas\", the functions of P\u0113rkons and Dievs can occasionally merge: P\u0113rkons is called \"P\u0113rkona t\u0113vs\" ('Father or God of Thunder') or \"Dievi\u0146\u0161\", a diminutive form of \"Dievs\". \nWeapons and vehicle.\nPerk\u016bnas is pictured as middle-aged, armed with an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; and arrows, riding a two-wheeled chariot harnessed with &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s, like &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; or Celtic &lt;a href=\"Taranis\"&gt;Taranis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn other accounts, the thunder god is described as driving a fiery chariot through the skies with swift horses, or riding a fiery horse.\nPerk\u016bnas' family relations.\nIn songs about a \"heavenly wedding\" &lt;a href=\"Saul%C4%97\"&gt;Saul\u0117&lt;/a&gt; (the Sun) cheats on Perk\u016bnas with M\u0117nulis (the Moon); Perk\u016bnas splits M\u0117nulis in half with a sword. According to another, more popular, version, M\u0117nulis cheats on the Sun with &lt;a href=\"Au%C5%A1rin%C4%97\"&gt;Au\u0161rin\u0117&lt;/a&gt; (the morning star) just after the wedding, and Perk\u016bnas punishes it. However, it does not learn and repeats the &lt;a href=\"adultery\"&gt;adultery&lt;/a&gt; and is punished again every month. Other explanations say it is why the Sun shines during the day and the Moon at night. Though divorced, both want to see their daughter &lt;a href=\"%C5%BDemyna\"&gt;\u017demyna&lt;/a&gt; (the Earth).\nIn other songs Perk\u016bnas, on the way to the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Au%C5%A1ra\"&gt;Au\u0161ra&lt;/a&gt; (dawn; the daughter of the Sun), strikes a golden oak. The oak is a tree of the thunder god in the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20mythology\"&gt;Baltic mythology&lt;/a&gt;. Lithuanian \"Perk\u016bno \u0105\u017euolas\" or Latvian \"P\u0113rkona ozols\" (\"oak of Perk\u016bnas\") is mentioned in a source dated to the first half of the 19th century.\nOther myths say that Perk\u016bnas and one &lt;a href=\"Laum%C4%97\"&gt;Laum\u0117&lt;/a&gt; or Vaiva (rainbow) were supposed to get married on Thursday, but the bride was kidnapped by Velnias (the devil) and Perk\u016bnas has hunted Velnias ever since.\nSome myths mention four sons of Perk\u016bnas (&lt;a href=\"Latvian%20language\"&gt;Latvian&lt;/a&gt;: \"Perkona d\u0113li\"; &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20language\"&gt;Lithuanian&lt;/a&gt;: \"Perk\u016bno s\u016bn\u016bs\"), who, apparently, are connected with the four seasons or with the four directions of the world (east, west, south and north). Sometimes there are seven or nine Perk\u016bnai referred to as brothers. It is said in Lithuanian \"Perk\u016bn\u0173 yra daug\" (\"there are many thunders\").\nIn some myths Perk\u016bnas expels his wife (and in some cases his children too) and remains in the sky by himself. Some myths offer a very different story: Dievas lifts Perk\u016bnas from the earth into the sky. Perk\u016bnas has stones in the sky (which rumble during storms) - the motive connected to &lt;a href=\"Indo-European%20mythology\"&gt;Indo-European mythology&lt;/a&gt;. Perk\u016bnas dwells on high hills or mountains: compare Lithuanian &lt;a href=\"toponymy\"&gt;toponymy&lt;/a&gt; of Perk\u016bnkalnis, \"mountain of Perk\u016bnas\", or Griausmo kalnas, \"mountain of rumble.\"\nIn most myths, however, Perk\u016bnas's wife is &lt;a href=\"%C5%BDemyna\"&gt;\u017demyna&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerk\u016bnas and Velnias.\nAn important function of Perk\u016bnas is to fight Velnias (in Latvian, \"Velns\"). He is sometimes considered the antithesis of Perk\u016bnas and is the god of the underworld and death. &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; considers \"Velnias\" akin to their \"devil\", though this is not in line with ancient beliefs.\nPerk\u016bnas pursues his opponent velns for picaroon or theft of fertility and cattle. Velnias hides in trees, under stones, or turns into various animals: a black cat, dog, pig, goat, lamb, pike, cow (compare to the Latvian representations of jods a creature with the cow hoofs) or a person.\nPerk\u016bnas pursues an opponent in the sky on a chariot, made from stone and fire (Lithuanian \"ugnies ratai\"). Sometimes the chariot is made from red iron. It is harnessed by a pair (less often four or three) of red and white (or black and white) horses (sometimes goats). Compare the Lithuanian deity of horses and chariots Ratainy\u010dia (Ratainicza mentioned in Lasick\u2018s works; from Lithuanian \"ratai\" - \"wheel\"). It is a mythologized image of a chariot of \"Didieji Gr\u012f\u017eulo Ratai\" (\"Grand Wheels of Gr\u012f\u017eulas\" (&lt;a href=\"Ursa%20Major\"&gt;Ursa Major&lt;/a&gt;). It agrees with &lt;a href=\"Samogitia\"&gt;Samogitia&lt;/a&gt;n representations, in which Perk\u016bnas is a horseman on a fiery horse. On his heavenly chariot Perk\u016bnas appears in the shape of a gray-haired old man with a big beard of many colors, in white and black clothes, holding a goat on a cord in one hand and a horn or an axe in the other.\nPerk\u016bnas possesses many weapons. They include an axe or sledgehammer, stones, a sword, lightning bolts, a bow and arrows, a club, and an iron or fiery knife. Perk\u016bnas is the creator of the weapons (\"Akmeninis kalvis\", \"the stone smith\") or he is helped by the heavenly smith Televelis (Kalvelis).\nAn opponent of Perk\u016bnas hides itself in the hollow of a tree or a stone (attributes of Perk\u016bnas). The &lt;a href=\"culmination\"&gt;culmination&lt;/a&gt; of Perk\u016bnas' hunt for his opponent is a thunder-storm; it not only clears the ground of evil spirits, but returns the stolen cattle or weapons.\nPerk\u016bnas is also connected to Thursday. Thursday is the day of the Thunderer in many traditions: compare &lt;a href=\"Polabian%20language\"&gt;Polabian&lt;/a&gt; \"Per\u00e4une-d\u01fbn\" (\"day of Perun\"), Lithuanian \"Perk\u016bno diena\". Perk\u016bnas is associated with the Roman god &lt;a href=\"Jupiter%20%28god%29\"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; in early sources. Thursday is a day of thunder-storms and rains, and also of weddings.\nPrussian Perk\u016bns.\n&lt;a href=\"Simon%20Grunau\"&gt;Simon Grunau&lt;/a&gt; (around 1520) describes a &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt; with Perk\u016bns on it. The god is represented as an angry middle aged man with a twisted black beard, topped with a flame. It stands between young &lt;a href=\"Patrimpas\"&gt;Patrimpas&lt;/a&gt; and old Patulas. Perk\u016bns maintains the same central position in the description of the sacred oak in &lt;a href=\"Romuva%20%28temple%29\"&gt;Romowe&lt;/a&gt; sanctuary. In front of the oak, the eternal fire (symbol of Perk\u016bns) was burned. Special priests served at the sanctuary. &lt;a href=\"Old%20Prussians\"&gt;Old Prussians&lt;/a&gt; would try to appeal to the god by prayers. &lt;a href=\"Percunatele\"&gt;Perkunatete&lt;/a&gt; was the mother of Perk\u016bns.\nLatvian P\u0113rkons.\nP\u0113rkons was strongly associated with &lt;a href=\"Dievs\"&gt;Dievs&lt;/a&gt;, though the two were clearly different. The people &lt;a href=\"sacrifice\"&gt;sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;d black &lt;a href=\"calf%20%28animal%29\"&gt;calves&lt;/a&gt;, goats, and &lt;a href=\"rooster\"&gt;rooster&lt;/a&gt;s to P\u0113rkons, especially during &lt;a href=\"drought\"&gt;drought&lt;/a&gt;s. The surrounding peoples came to these sacrifices to eat and drink together, after pouring &lt;a href=\"beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; onto the ground or into the fire for him. The Latvians also sacrificed cooked food before meals to P\u0113rkons, in order to prevent &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s, during which &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;s were placed into fires to disperse the clouds.\nP\u0113rkons' family included sons that symbolized various aspects of thunderstorms (such as thunder, &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;, lightning strikes) and daughters that symbolized various kinds of rain.\nP\u0113rkons appeared on a &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;en &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, wielding a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"club%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;, golden &lt;a href=\"whip\"&gt;whip&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt;. Ancient Latvians wore tiny axes on their clothing in his honor.\nIn modern culture.\nPerkunas is occasionally mentioned in the novels of &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Turtledove\"&gt;Harry Turtledove&lt;/a&gt;. He provides an important &lt;a href=\"macguffin\"&gt;macguffin&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Case%20of%20the%20Toxic%20Spell%20Dump\"&gt;The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump&lt;/a&gt;\" and is the patron god of one of the armies in \"&lt;a href=\"Gunpowder%20Empire\"&gt;Gunpowder Empire&lt;/a&gt;\".\n&lt;a href=\"G%C3%BCnter%20Grass\"&gt;G\u00fcnter Grass&lt;/a&gt;, in his second novel &lt;a href=\"Dog%20Years%20%28novel%29\"&gt;\"Dog Years\"&lt;/a&gt; (1963), alludes to Perk\u016bnas (\"Perkunos\") as a symbol of the dark human energies unleashed by the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s.\nThe fictional parallel to &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20history\"&gt;alternate history&lt;/a&gt; novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gate%20of%20Time\"&gt;The Gate of Time&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Jos%C3%A9%20Farmer\"&gt;Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer&lt;/a&gt; is called Perkunisha, named after Perk\u016bnas.\nThe Lithuanian folk music group &lt;a href=\"K%C5%ABlgrinda%20%28band%29\"&gt;K\u016blgrinda&lt;/a&gt; released an album in 2003 titled \"Perk\u016bno Giesm\u0117s\", meaning \"Hymns of Perk\u016bnas\"."
