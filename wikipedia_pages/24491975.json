    "text": "The Pfau\u2013Crichton Cottage, best known as Chinaberry, is a historic cottage in &lt;a href=\"Mobile%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Mobile, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. The -story, wood-frame, &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coast%20cottage\"&gt;Gulf Coast cottage&lt;/a&gt; was completed in 1862. The house was built by the Pfau family, but its best known resident was Miss Anne Randolph Crichton, known for the elaborate gardens that she developed on the property. She enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt; at the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and continued her service until retirement, in the 1950s. She traveled extensively in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; during the 1930s, maintaining scrapbooks that recorded her visits to various art museums, gardens, and monuments. She was the last direct descendant of Hugh Randolph Crichton, the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Mobile County&lt;/a&gt; town of Crichton. The house was added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; on October 18, 1984, as a part of the &lt;a href=\"19th%20Century%20Spring%20Hill%20Neighborhood%20Thematic%20Resource\"&gt;19th Century Spring Hill Neighborhood Thematic Resource&lt;/a&gt; listing of well-preserved buildings that represent the historical development of what was once the village of Spring Hill.\nThe cottage is unique in its architectural features.
