    "title": "Holroyd v Marshall",
    "text": "Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HLC 191, 11 ER 999 was a judicial decision of the &lt;a href=\"Judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords\"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;. In that case the House of Lords affirmed that under &lt;a href=\"English%20law\"&gt;English law&lt;/a&gt; a person could grant a &lt;a href=\"mortgage\"&gt;mortgage&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"security%20interest\"&gt;security interest&lt;/a&gt; over future property, ie. property that they did not actually own at the time of granting the charge. Prior to decision, the generally accepted principle under English law was that pursuant to the &lt;a href=\"nemo%20dat%20quod%20non%20habet\"&gt;\"nemo dat\" rule&lt;/a&gt; it was impossible for a person to convey a security interest in property which they did not own at the time of granting the charge.\nThe case is also notable in that no less than three persons who were, or one day would be, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Chancellor\"&gt;Lord Chancellor&lt;/a&gt;, gave judgments. It is also a rare example of one &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Appeal%20in%20Ordinary\"&gt;Law Lord&lt;/a&gt; interrupting another during their speech to object to a point in their judgment.\nBackground.\nThe case was decided against the backdrop of the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;industrial revolution&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian England&lt;/a&gt;. With the expansion of industry, companies were hungry for capital, and commercial parties were exploring new ways for these companies to raise debt finance by way of &lt;a href=\"debenture\"&gt;debenture&lt;/a&gt;s. As part of that process debenture holders were seeking greater protection for themselves to protect the capital which they invested in these new ventures to ensure that, if the company failed, that they had a prior claim the company's assets over any competing creditors.\nFacts.\nThe underlying borrower was a businessman named James Taylor, who was engaged as a &lt;a href=\"damask\"&gt;damask&lt;/a&gt; manufacturer at Hayes Mill, &lt;a href=\"Ovenden\"&gt;Ovenden&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Halifax%2C%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Halifax, Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;. The case reports that \"[i]n 1858 he became embarrassed, [and] a sale of his effects by auction took place\". The Holroyds purchased all of his machinery. They subsequently sold it back to him, but because he could not pay for it, the purchase price was left outstanding and a security interest was granted over the machinery. However, the indenture granting the security interest not only referred to the existing machinery, but separately to:\nThe indenture was duly registered under the &lt;a href=\"Bills%20of%20Sale%20Act%201854\"&gt;Bills of Sale Act 1854&lt;/a&gt; (17 &amp; 18 Vict, c. 36). \nAs time passed Taylor sold and replaced some of the machinery, and bought some new machinery.\nOn 13 April 1860 one Emil Preller sued Taylor, and Mr &lt;a href=\"James%20Garth%20Marshall\"&gt;Garth Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, the high sheriff of York, executed a writ of \"&lt;a href=\"scire%20facias\"&gt;scire facias&lt;/a&gt;\" against Taylor and machinery was seized in appropriation of the claims.\nOn 30 May 1860 the Holroyds filed a bill for relief claiming that they had superior title. The case came initially before the Vice Chancellor, who found in favour of the Holroyds. The judgment creditors then appealed, and the case came before &lt;a href=\"John%20Campbell%2C%201st%20Baron%20Campbell\"&gt;Lord Campbell LC&lt;/a&gt;, who reversed the decision. He held:\nThe Holroyds then appealed to the House of Lords.\nDecision.\n&lt;a href=\"Richard%20Bethell%2C%201st%20Baron%20Westbury\"&gt;Lord Westbury LC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20Parke%2C%201st%20Baron%20Wensleydale\"&gt;Lord Wensleydale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frederic%20Thesiger%2C%201st%20Baron%20Chelmsford\"&gt;Lord Chelmsford&lt;/a&gt; each gave judgments.\nLord Westbury started by noting that the respondents had conceded that if the mortgagees (the Holroyds) had an equitable interest in the added machinery then it could not be seized by them as judgment creditors. He then stated that \"[t]he question may be easily decided by the application of a few elementary principles long settled in the Court of Equity.\" He noted that a contract for sale of any property would immediately pass a beneficial interest in that property, and this applied not only to real estate but also to personal property. This drove him to the inevitable conclusion that:\nHe accepted that a contract for the sale of property which does not exist at the time is &lt;a href=\"void%20%28law%29\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;. However, he felt that there was a crucial distinction between the position at law and in equity:\nTherefore he concluded:\nLord Wensleydale affirmed that if an agreement was specifically enforceable, then once the property was acquired, then an incohate interest in the property vested immediately.\nConsequences.\nThe decision had a transformative effect on security interests and the ability of companies to raise finance. It led indirectly to the decision of &lt;a href=\"George%20Markham%20Giffard\"&gt;Giffard LJ&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"In%20re%20Panama%2C%20New%20Zealand%2C%20and%20Australian%20Royal%20Mail%20Co\"&gt;In re Panama, New Zealand, and Australian Royal Mail Co&lt;/a&gt;\" (1870) 5 Ch App 318 which is generally accepted as the first decision under English law to recognise a &lt;a href=\"floating%20charge\"&gt;floating charge&lt;/a&gt;."
