He is known for his long association with &lt;a href=\"Friesland\"&gt;Frisian&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"SC%20Heerenveen\"&gt;SC Heerenveen&lt;/a&gt;. De Haan was the manager of the &lt;a href=\"Tuvalu%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Tuvalu national football team&lt;/a&gt; during 2011 and then rejoined Heerenveen's youth programme. He is also a politician for the &lt;a href=\"Partij%20van%20de%20Arbeid\"&gt;Partij van de Arbeid&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nDe Haan was born in &lt;a href=\"Opsterland\"&gt;Lippenhuizen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Friesland\"&gt;Friesland&lt;/a&gt;. He started his managerial career in 1974 with VV Akkrum. After two years he combined this role with the youth team manager's position at &lt;a href=\"SC%20Heerenveen\"&gt;SC Heerenveen&lt;/a&gt;. By 1978 he had become the manager for &lt;a href=\"Drachtster%20Boys\"&gt;Drachtster Boys&lt;/a&gt;. He then moved to &lt;a href=\"Asser%20Christelijke%20Voetbalvereniging\"&gt;ACV&lt;/a&gt; in 1980, and to &lt;a href=\"Steenwijk\"&gt;Steenwijk&lt;/a&gt; in 1983. In 1985 de Haan re-joined Heerenveen, this time as assistant coach. He would go on to spend 20 years with the club, the longest time a coach worked for a Dutch professional football club. De Haan was made head coach in 1992, and in 1993 led the club back to the &lt;a href=\"Eredivisie\"&gt;Eredivisie&lt;/a&gt;. The finished in second place in the Eredivisie with Heerenveen in 2000, thus qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in the club's history.\nIn 2003, he received the Sport Award and on 10 May 2004, after his final game as coach of SC Heerenveen, he was invested as a Knight of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Orange-Nassau\"&gt;Order of Orange-Nassau&lt;/a&gt;.

De Haan was accused by &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Taylor%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Steven Taylor&lt;/a&gt; of calling him a \"cheat\" as he had been injured in the match and was originally not going to take a penalty in the semi-final penalty shoot-out. Taylor eventually took and scored his penalty in the shootout which the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20under-21%20football%20team\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; won despite this. A semifinal spot in the latter tournament also qualified the Dutch for the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20tournament\"&gt;2008 Summer Olympics football tournament&lt;/a&gt;, leading his side to the quarter-finals where they were ultimately defeated by &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"extra%20time\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt;.\nDe Haan had announced that he would retire from football at the end of the 2008\u201309 season, when his contract with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dutch%20Football%20Association\"&gt;KNVB&lt;/a&gt; expired.
