He graduated from San Fernando High School in San Fernando, California. He played &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20California\"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt;.\nProfessional career.\nNFL career.\nMoore was a 9th round selection (216th overall) in the &lt;a href=\"1974%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1974 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2049ers\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt;. He played for the 49ers in 1974 and 1975, being named their special teams player of the year in both seasons. He then spent the &lt;a href=\"1976%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1976 NFL season&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Tampa Bay Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, after being selected by them in the &lt;a href=\"1976%20NFL%20expansion%20draft\"&gt;1976 NFL expansion draft&lt;/a&gt;. Near the end of the 1976 season he was cut by the winless Buccaneers (0-13 at that point) and signed by the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Raiders\"&gt;Oakland Raiders&lt;/a&gt; to replace their injured kick returner &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Jennings\"&gt;Rick Jennings&lt;/a&gt;.\nSwitch to rugby league.\nFollowing his Super Bowl appearance, Moore was recruited by Australian &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20Football%20League%20premiership\"&gt;New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership&lt;/a&gt; team the &lt;a href=\"Newtown%20Jets\"&gt;Newtown Jets&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1977%20NSWRFL%20season\"&gt;1977 NSWRFL season&lt;/a&gt;, with the move being financed by &lt;a href=\"John%20Singleton%20%28Australian%20entrepreneur%29\"&gt;John Singleton&lt;/a&gt;. He made his first grade debut just 98 days after the Super Bowl, playing on the wing against the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Suburbs%20Magpies\"&gt;Western Suburbs Magpies&lt;/a&gt; before 5,743 spectators at &lt;a href=\"Henson%20Park\"&gt;Henson Park&lt;/a&gt;. He impressed on debut, scoring the club's first try of the season. This made him the first, and to date only, person to score a first grade rugby league try in Australia and an NFL touchdown in the US. Moore lasted only four games in the NSWRFL; he was relegated to reserve grade and played in the second row before receiving a head injury in a match against &lt;a href=\"Penrith%20Panthers\"&gt;Penrith&lt;/a&gt; which prompted him to return to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; prematurely.\nReturn to the NFL.\nMoore returned to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Vikings\"&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/a&gt;, playing twelve games in the &lt;a href=\"1977%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1977 NFL season&lt;/a&gt;."
