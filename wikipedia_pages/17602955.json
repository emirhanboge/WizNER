    "text": "Errol Daniels Hibbert (born May 17, 1944 in &lt;a href=\"Gu%C3%A1cimo\"&gt;Gu\u00e1cimo&lt;/a&gt;) is a former &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player, who used to play as a striker for &lt;a href=\"L.D.%20Alajuelense\"&gt;Alajuelense&lt;/a&gt;. He played for the same club his entire career except for a final season at &lt;a href=\"Puntarenas%20F.C.\"&gt;Puntarenas&lt;/a&gt;. He currently resides in New York.\nClub career.\nDaniels made his debut in the Costa Rican &lt;a href=\"Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; with only 21 year-old on June 14, 1964 against &lt;a href=\"C.S.%20Cartagin%C3%A9s\"&gt;Cartagin\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;, scoring 2 goals. He started playing as a left forward because the center forward position was being filled by another historic player, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Ulloa\"&gt;Juan Ulloa&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis strengths were his explosive speed and his ferocious shot. He was always distinguished for being an ally with the goal and was top scorer of his local league in 6 seasons (1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1970). Daniels is the all-time top scorer of the league with 196 goals. He scored 234 goals in all games. Daniels shares the record for most goals scored in the Costa Rican Primera, notching 41 goals for &lt;a href=\"LD%20Alajuelense\"&gt;LD Alajuelense&lt;/a&gt; during the 1967 season. He scored 24 goals in 1964, 32 in 1965, 30 in 1966, 41 in 1967, 23 in 1968, 16 in 1969, 25 in 1970 and one goal in 1971 and 1972. He also won the national tournament with his team in 1966, 1970 and 1971.\nHis career suddenly faded due to an injury on April 14, 1971. The season was just starting and in the second game he crashed against the goalkeeper from &lt;a href=\"Barrio%20M%C3%A9xico\"&gt;Barrio M\u00e9xico&lt;/a&gt;, Freddy Jim\u00e9nez Luna, fracturing his right leg. He returned on June 25, 1972 against &lt;a href=\"AD%20San%20Carlos\"&gt;AD San Carlos&lt;/a&gt;, and scored his last goal on September 17 of the same year against &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20Puntarenas\"&gt;Municipal Puntarenas&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoal record controversy.\nDaniels officially scored 196 league goals as recorded by UNAFUT. However it has been reported he scored another 4 goals in 1963, claiming his total to be 200 goals. He was surpassed by &lt;a href=\"V%C3%ADctor%20N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez\"&gt;V\u00edctor N\u00fa\u00f1ez&lt;/a&gt; as Costa Rican premier division all-time top goalscorer in November 2013.\nDaniels also holds the record of scoring 15 goals in 11 consecutive games.\nInternational career.\nDaniels was also part of the &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ticos&lt;/a&gt; from 1965 to 1970, playing 18 games and scoring 7 goals. He represented his country in 3 &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification\"&gt;FIFA World Cup qualification&lt;/a&gt; matches.\nRetirement.\nAfter leaving Puntarenas he trained with New York Cosmos but later worked at a fur coat factory and a women's fashion house in New York."
