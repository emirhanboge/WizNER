    "title": "Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile",
    "text": "Alfonso VII (1 March 110521 August 1157), called the Emperor (\"el Emperador\"), became the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Galicia\"&gt;King of Galicia&lt;/a&gt; in 1111 and &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;King of Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Castile&lt;/a&gt; in 1126. Alfonso, born Alfonso Raim\u00fandez, first used the title &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20of%20All%20Spain\"&gt;Emperor of All Spain&lt;/a&gt;, alongside his mother Urraca, once she vested him with the direct rule of Toledo in 1116. Alfonso later held another investiture in 1135 in a grand ceremony reasserting his claims to the imperial title. He was the son of &lt;a href=\"Urraca%20of%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Urraca of Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;Raymond of Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;, the first of the &lt;a href=\"Anscarids\"&gt;House of Ivrea&lt;/a&gt; to rule in the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20peninsula\"&gt;Iberian peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlfonso was a dignified and somewhat enigmatic figure. His rule was characterised by the renewed supremacy of the western kingdoms of Christian &lt;a href=\"Iberia\"&gt;Iberia&lt;/a&gt; over the eastern (&lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Navarre\"&gt;Navarre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Arag%C3%B3n\"&gt;Arag\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;) after the reign of &lt;a href=\"Alfonso%20the%20Battler\"&gt;Alfonso the Battler&lt;/a&gt;. Though he sought to make the imperial title meaningful in practice to both Christian and Muslim populations, his hegemonic intentions never saw fruition. During his tenure, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; became \"de facto\" independent, in 1128, and was recognized as \"de jure\" independent, in 1143. He was a patron of poets, including, probably, the &lt;a href=\"troubadour\"&gt;troubadour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marcabru\"&gt;Marcabru&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuccession to three kingdoms.\nIn 1111, &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Gelm%C3%ADrez\"&gt;Diego Gelm\u00edrez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Compostela\"&gt;Bishop of Compostela&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"count%20of%20Traba\"&gt;count of Traba&lt;/a&gt;, crowned and anointed Alfonso King of Galicia in the cathedral of &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20de%20Compostela\"&gt;Santiago de Compostela&lt;/a&gt;. He was a child, but his mother had (1109) succeeded to the united throne of Le\u00f3n-Castile-Galicia and desired to assure her son's prospects and groom him for his eventual succession. By 1125 he had inherited the formerly Muslim Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;. On 10 March 1126, after the death of his mother, he was crowned in &lt;a href=\"Le%C3%B3n%2C%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; and immediately began the recovery of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Kingdom of Castile&lt;/a&gt;, which was then under the domination of Alfonso the Battler. By the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20of%20T%C3%A1mara\"&gt;Peace of T\u00e1mara&lt;/a&gt; of 1127, the Battler recognised Alfonso VII of Castile. The territory in the far east of his dominion, however, had gained much independence during the rule of his mother and experienced many rebellions. After his recognition in Castile, Alfonso fought to curb the autonomy of the local barons.\nWhen Alfonso the Battler, &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Navarre\"&gt;King of Navarre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;Arag\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, died without descendants in 1134, he willed his kingdom to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Templar\"&gt;Knights Templar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Hospitaller\"&gt;Knights Hospitaller&lt;/a&gt;. The aristocracy of both kingdoms rejected this. &lt;a href=\"Garc%C3%ADa%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20of%20Navarre\"&gt;Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez&lt;/a&gt;, Count of &lt;a href=\"Monz%C3%B3n\"&gt;Monz\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; was elected in Navarre while Alfonso pretended to the throne of Arag\u00f3n. The nobles chose another candidate in the dead king's brother, &lt;a href=\"Ramiro%20II%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;Ramiro II&lt;/a&gt;. Alfonso responded by reclaiming &lt;a href=\"La%20Rioja%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;La Rioja&lt;/a&gt; and \"attempted to annex the district around Zaragoza and Tarazona\".\nIn several skirmishes, he defeated the joint Navarro-Aragonese army and put the kingdoms to vassalage. He had the strong support of the lords north of the &lt;a href=\"Pyrenees\"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt;, who held lands as far as the &lt;a href=\"River%20Rh%C3%B4ne\"&gt;River Rh\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, however, the combined forces of the Navarre and Arag\u00f3n were too much for his control. At this time, he helped &lt;a href=\"Ramon%20Berenguer%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Barcelona\"&gt;Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, in his wars with the other &lt;a href=\"Catalan%20counties\"&gt;Catalan counties&lt;/a&gt; to unite the old \"&lt;a href=\"Marca%20Hispanica\"&gt;Marca Hispanica&lt;/a&gt;\".\nImperial rule.\nA vague tradition had always assigned the title of emperor to the sovereign who held Le\u00f3n. &lt;a href=\"Sancho%20the%20Great\"&gt;Sancho the Great&lt;/a&gt; considered the city the \"imperiale culmen\" and minted coins with the inscription \"Imperator totius Hispaniae\" after being crowned in it. Such a sovereign was considered the most direct representative of the &lt;a href=\"Visigoths\"&gt;Visigothic&lt;/a&gt; kings, who had been themselves the representatives of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. But though appearing in charters, and claimed by &lt;a href=\"Alfonso%20VI%20of%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alfonso%20the%20Battler\"&gt;Alfonso the Battler&lt;/a&gt;, the title had been little more than a flourish of rhetoric.\nOn 26 May 1135, Alfonso was crowned \"Emperor of Spain\" in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Cathedral of Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. By this, he probably wished to assert his authority over the entire peninsula and his absolute leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Reconquista\"&gt;Reconquista&lt;/a&gt;. He appears to have striven for the formation of a national unity which &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; had never possessed since the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Visigothic\"&gt;Visigothic&lt;/a&gt; kingdom. The elements he had to deal with could not be welded together. The weakness of Aragon enabled him to make his superiority effective. After &lt;a href=\"Afonso%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Afonso Henriques&lt;/a&gt; recognised him as &lt;a href=\"Feudalism\"&gt;liege&lt;/a&gt; in 1137, Alfonso VII lost the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Valdevez\"&gt;Battle of Valdevez&lt;/a&gt; in 1141 thereby affirming Portugal's independence in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Zamora%20%281143%29\"&gt;Treaty of Zamora (1143)&lt;/a&gt;. In 1143, he himself recognised this \"status quo\" and consented to the marriage of &lt;a href=\"Petronila%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;Petronila of Aragon&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Ramon%20Berenguer%20IV%2C%20Count%20of%20Barcelona\"&gt;Ramon Berenguer IV&lt;/a&gt;, a union which combined Aragon and Catalonia into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;Crown of Aragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar against Al-Andalus.\nAlfonso was a pious prince. He introduced the &lt;a href=\"Cistercians\"&gt;Cistercians&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Iberia\"&gt;Iberia&lt;/a&gt; by founding a monastery at &lt;a href=\"Fitero\"&gt;Fitero&lt;/a&gt;. He adopted a militant attitude towards the &lt;a href=\"Moors\"&gt;Moors&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Al-Andalus\"&gt;Al-Andalus&lt;/a&gt;, especially the &lt;a href=\"Almoravids\"&gt;Almoravids&lt;/a&gt;. From 1138, when he &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Coria%20%281138%29\"&gt;besieged Coria&lt;/a&gt;, Alfonso led a series of &lt;a href=\"crusades\"&gt;crusades&lt;/a&gt; subjugating the Almoravids. After &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Oreja\"&gt;a seven-month siege&lt;/a&gt;, he took the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Oreja\"&gt;Oreja&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt; and, as the \"&lt;a href=\"Chronica%20Adefonsi%20Imperatoris\"&gt;Chronica Adefonsi Imperatoris&lt;/a&gt;\" tells it:\nIn 1142, Alfonso &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Coria%20%281142%29\"&gt;besieged Coria a second time&lt;/a&gt; and took it. In 1144, he advanced as far as &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Spain\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later, the &lt;a href=\"Almohads\"&gt;Almohads&lt;/a&gt; invaded and he was forced to refortify his southern frontier and come to an agreement with the Almoravid &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20Ganiya\"&gt;Ibn Ganiya&lt;/a&gt; for their mutual defence. When &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Eugene%20III\"&gt;Pope Eugene III&lt;/a&gt; preached the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Crusade\"&gt;Second Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, Alfonso VII, with Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre and Ramon Berenguer IV, led a mixed army of &lt;a href=\"Catalan%20people\"&gt;Catalans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franks\"&gt;Franks&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Genoa\"&gt;Genoese&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Pisa\"&gt;Pisan&lt;/a&gt; navy, in a crusade against the rich port city of &lt;a href=\"Almer%C3%ADa\"&gt;Almer\u00eda&lt;/a&gt;, which was occupied in October 1147. A third of the city was granted to Genoa and subsequently leased out to &lt;a href=\"Otto%20de%20Bonvillano\"&gt;Otto de Bonvillano&lt;/a&gt;, a Genoese citizen. It was Castile's first &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; seaport. In 1151, Alfonso signed the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Tudil%C3%A9n\"&gt;Treaty of Tudil\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt; with Ramon Berenguer. The treaty defined the zones of conquest in Andalusia in order to prevent the two rulers from coming into conflict. Six years later, Almer\u00eda entered into Almohad possession. Alfonso was returning from an expedition against them when he died on 21 August 1157 in Las Fresnedas, north of the &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Morena\"&gt;Sierra Morena&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nAlfonso was at once a patron of the church and a protector, though not a supporter of, the Muslims, who were a minority of his subjects. His reign ended in an unsuccessful campaign against the rising power of the Almohads. Though he was not actually defeated, his death in the pass, while on his way back to &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;, occurred in circumstances which showed that no man could be what he claimed to be \u2013 \"&lt;a href=\"Emperor%20of%20the%20Two%20Religions\"&gt;king of the men of the two religions&lt;/a&gt;.\" Furthermore, by dividing his realm between his sons, he ensured that Christendom would not present the new Almohad threat with a united front.\nFamily.\nIn November 1128, he married &lt;a href=\"Berenguela%20of%20Barcelona\"&gt;Berenguela&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Ramon%20Berenguer%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Barcelona\"&gt;Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. She died in 1149. Their children were:\nIn 1152, Alfonso married &lt;a href=\"Richeza%20of%20Poland%2C%20Queen%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Richeza of Poland&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Wladislaus%20II%20the%20Exile%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Ladislaus II the Exile&lt;/a&gt;. They had:\nAlfonso also had two mistresses, having children by both. By an &lt;a href=\"Asturia\"&gt;Asturia&lt;/a&gt;n noblewoman named &lt;a href=\"Gontrodo%20P%C3%A9rez\"&gt;Gontrodo P\u00e9rez&lt;/a&gt;, he had an illegitimate daughter, &lt;a href=\"Urraca%20of%20Castile%2C%20Queen%20of%20Navarre\"&gt;Urraca&lt;/a&gt; (1132\u20131164), who married &lt;a href=\"Garc%C3%ADa%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20of%20Navarre\"&gt;Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre&lt;/a&gt;, the mother retiring to a convent in 1133. Later in his reign, he formed a liaison with Urraca Fern\u00e1ndez, widow of count &lt;a href=\"Rodrigo%20Mart%C3%ADnez\"&gt;Rodrigo Mart\u00ednez&lt;/a&gt; and daughter of &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Garc%C3%ADa%20de%20Hita\"&gt;Fernando Garc\u00eda de Hita&lt;/a&gt;, having a daughter, &lt;a href=\"Stephanie%20the%20Unfortunate\"&gt;Stephanie the Unfortunate&lt;/a&gt; (1148\u20131180), who was killed by her jealous husband, &lt;a href=\"Fern%C3%A1n%20Ruiz%20de%20Castro\"&gt;Fern\u00e1n Ruiz de Castro&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn fiction.\nA parody version of king Alfonso and queen Berengaria is presented in the tragicomedy \"La venganza de Don Mendo\" by &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Mu%C3%B1oz%20Seca\"&gt;Pedro Mu\u00f1oz Seca&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Don%20Mendo%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;its film version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Garisa\"&gt;Antonio Garisa&lt;/a&gt; played Alfonso."
