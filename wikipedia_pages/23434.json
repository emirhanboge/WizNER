    "text": "The politics of the Republic of Peru takes place in a framework of a &lt;a href=\"Unitary%20state\"&gt;unitary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Semi-presidential%20system\"&gt;semi-presidential&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Representative%20democracy\"&gt;representative democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;, whereby the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Peru\"&gt;President of Peru&lt;/a&gt; is both &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20government\"&gt;head of government&lt;/a&gt;, and of a &lt;a href=\"Diversity%20%28politics%29\"&gt;pluriform&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"multi-party%20system\"&gt;multi-party system&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Executive%20power\"&gt;Executive power&lt;/a&gt; is exercised by the President and the Government. &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20power\"&gt;Legislative power&lt;/a&gt; is vested in both the &lt;a href=\"Government\"&gt;Government&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Judiciary\"&gt;Judiciary&lt;/a&gt; is independent of the executive and the legislature. Support for traditional &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;political parties&lt;/a&gt; have thoroughly collapsed in Peru since 2000, paving the way for the rise of personalist leaderships. The political parties in the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Peru\"&gt;congress of Peru&lt;/a&gt; are, according to political scientist Lucia Dammert, \"agglomerations of individual and group interests more than solid and representative parties\".\nThe historian &lt;a href=\"Gast%C3%B3n%20Antonio%20Zapata%20Velasco\"&gt;Antonio Zapata&lt;/a&gt; describes Peru as a \"&lt;a href=\"Right-wing%20politics\"&gt;right-wing&lt;/a&gt; country\", the only &lt;a href=\"Left-wing%20politics\"&gt;left-wing&lt;/a&gt; government in contemporary history until the election of &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Castillo\"&gt;Pedro Castillo&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 being that of &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Velasco%20Alvarado\"&gt;Juan Velasco Alvarado&lt;/a&gt; (1968-1975), author of an agrarian reform and the nationalization of strategic sectors. Currently, almost all major media and political parties in the country are in favour of economic liberalism. Those opposed to the &lt;a href=\"neoliberal\"&gt;neoliberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Status%20quo\"&gt;\"status quo\"&lt;/a&gt; or involved in left-wing politics are often targeted with &lt;a href=\"fear%20mongering\"&gt;fear mongering&lt;/a&gt; attacks called \"&lt;a href=\"terruqueo\"&gt;terruqueo&lt;/a&gt;s\", where individuals or groups are associated with &lt;a href=\"Terrorism\"&gt;terrorists&lt;/a&gt; involved with the &lt;a href=\"internal%20conflict%20in%20Peru\"&gt;internal conflict in Peru&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn 1924, from &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, university reform leaders in Peru who had been forced into exile by the government founded the &lt;a href=\"American%20People%27s%20Revolutionary%20Alliance\"&gt;American People's Revolutionary Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which had a major influence on the country's political life. APRA is thus largely a political expression of the university reform and workers' struggles of the years 1918\u20131920. The movement draws its influences from the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20revolution\"&gt;Mexican revolution&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"1917%20Constitution\"&gt;1917 Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, particularly on issues of &lt;a href=\"agrarianism\"&gt;agrarianism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"indigenism\"&gt;indigenism&lt;/a&gt;, and to a lesser extent from the Russian revolution. Close to &lt;a href=\"Marxism\"&gt;Marxism&lt;/a&gt; (its leader, &lt;a href=\"Haya%20de%20la%20Torre\"&gt;Haya de la Torre&lt;/a&gt;, declares that \"APRA is the Marxist interpretation of the American reality\"), it nevertheless moves away from it on the question of class struggle and on the importance given to the struggle for the political unity of Latin America.\nIn 1928, the Peruvian Socialist Party was founded, notably under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Carlos%20Mari%C3%A1tegui\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui&lt;/a&gt;, himself an spectator of the European socialist movements, who maintained relantionships with the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Communist Party of Italy&lt;/a&gt; and the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Palmiro%20Togliatti\"&gt;Palmiro Togliatti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Gramsci\"&gt;Antonio Gramsci&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly afterwards, in 1929, the party created the General Confederation of Workers.\nDuring the government of &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Fujimori\"&gt;Fujimori&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Peru\"&gt;1979 Constitution&lt;/a&gt; was changed after the &lt;a href=\"1992%20Peruvian%20constitutional%20crisis\"&gt;Fujimori's self-coup&lt;/a&gt; where the president dissolved the Congress and established the new &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Peru\"&gt;1993 Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. One of the changes to the 1979 Constitution was the possibility of the president's immediate reelection (112 article) which made possible the reelection of Fujimori in the next years. After the Fujimori era and Fujimori's resignation, the transition government of &lt;a href=\"Valent%C3%ADn%20Paniagua\"&gt;Valent\u00edn Paniagua&lt;/a&gt; changed the article 112 and called new elections in 2001 where &lt;a href=\"Alejandro%20Toledo\"&gt;Alejandro Toledo&lt;/a&gt; was elected. After that, Peru has had all &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Peru\"&gt;presidents&lt;/a&gt; democratically elected.\nOn 28 July 2021, left-wing candidate &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Castillo\"&gt;Pedro Castillo&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in as the new &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Peru\"&gt;President of Peru&lt;/a&gt; after a narrow win in a tightly contested run-off &lt;a href=\"2021%20Peruvian%20general%20election\"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;. The new Peruvian president Castillo appointed &lt;a href=\"Guido%20Bellido\"&gt;Guido Bellido&lt;/a&gt;, a member of Marxist-Leninist Free Peru party, as prime minister.\nAllegations of corruption in politics.\nExceptionally many &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Presidents of Peru&lt;/a&gt; have been ousted from office or imprisoned on allegations of corruption over the past three decades. &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Fujimori\"&gt;Alberto Fujimori&lt;/a&gt; is serving a 25-year sentence in prison for commanding &lt;a href=\"Death%20squad\"&gt;death squads&lt;/a&gt; that killed civilians in a counterinsurgency campaign during his tenure (1990-2000). He was later also found guilty of corruption. Former president &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Garc%C3%ADa\"&gt;Alan Garc\u00eda&lt;/a&gt; (1985-1990 and 2006-2011) committed suicide in April 2019 when Peruvian police arrived to arrest him over allegations he participated in &lt;a href=\"Odebrecht%20Case\"&gt;Odebrecht bribery&lt;/a&gt; scheme. Former president &lt;a href=\"Alejandro%20Toledo\"&gt;Alejandro Toledo&lt;/a&gt; is accused of allegedly receiving bribe from Brazilian construction firm &lt;a href=\"Odebrecht\"&gt;Odebrecht&lt;/a&gt; during his government (2001-2006). Former president &lt;a href=\"Ollanta%20Humala\"&gt;Ollanta Humala&lt;/a&gt; (2011-2016) is also under investigation for allegedly receiving bribe from Odebrecht during his presidential election campaign. Humala's successor &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Pablo%20Kuczynski\"&gt;Pedro Pablo Kuczynski&lt;/a&gt; (2016-2018) remains under house arrest while prosecutors investigate him for favoring contracts with Odebrecht. Former president &lt;a href=\"Mart%C3%ADn%20Vizcarra\"&gt;Mart\u00edn Vizcarra&lt;/a&gt; (2018-2020) was ousted by Congress after media reports alleged he had received bribes while he was a regional governor years earlier. \nExecutive branch.\nUnder the current constitution, the President is the &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20government\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;; he or she is elected for a five-year term and may not immediately be re-elected. All citizens above the age of eighteen are entitled and in fact &lt;a href=\"Compulsory%20voting\"&gt;compelled&lt;/a&gt; to vote. The first and second vice presidents also are popularly elected but have no constitutional functions unless the president is unable to discharge his duties.\nThe President appoints the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; \"(Primer Ministro)\" and the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Council of Ministers&lt;/a&gt; \"(Consejo de Ministros,\" or Cabinet), which is individually and collectively responsible both to the president and the legislature. All presidential decree laws or draft bills sent to Congress must be approved by the Council of Ministers.\nLegislative branch.\nThe legislative branch consists of a unicameral &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; \"(Congreso)\" of 130 members. elected for a five-year term by &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; In addition to passing laws, Congress ratifies treaties, authorizes government loans, and approves the government budget. The president has the power to block legislation with which the executive branch does not agree.\nJudicial branch.\nThe judicial branch of government is headed by a 16-member &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20court\"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; seated in &lt;a href=\"Lima\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt;. The National Council of the Judiciary appoints judges to this court.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Constitutional Court&lt;/a&gt; \"(Tribunal Constitucional)\" interprets the constitution on matters of individual rights. Superior courts in regional capitals review appeals from decisions by lower courts. Courts of first instance are located in provincial capitals and are divided into civil, penal, and special chambers. The judiciary has created several temporary specialized courts in an attempt to reduce the large backlog of cases pending final court action.\nPeru's legal system is based on civil law system. Peru has not accepted compulsory &lt;a href=\"International%20Court%20of%20Justice\"&gt;ICJ&lt;/a&gt; jurisdiction. In 1996 a &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ombudsman\"&gt;ombudsman&lt;/a&gt;'s office \"(defensor del pueblo)\" was created to address &lt;a href=\"human%20right\"&gt;human right&lt;/a&gt;s issues.\nAdministrative divisions.\nPeru's territory, according to the Regionalization Law which was passed on 18 November 2002, is divided into 25 &lt;a href=\"region\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;s (regiones). These regions are subdivided into &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;s, which are composed of &lt;a href=\"district\"&gt;district&lt;/a&gt;s. There are a total of 180 provinces and 1747 districts in Peru.\n&lt;a href=\"Lima%20Province\"&gt;Lima Province&lt;/a&gt; is not part of any political region.\nOrganizations.\nArmed groups.\nLeftist guerrilla groups include &lt;a href=\"Shining%20Path\"&gt;Shining Path&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"T%C3%BApac%20Amaru%20Revolutionary%20Movement\"&gt;T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement&lt;/a&gt; (MRTA). Both Shining Path and MRTA are considered &lt;a href=\"terrorism\"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; organizations.\nRegional groups.\nRegional groups representing peasant and indigenous groups exist in the outlying provinces, often working to promote autonomy. Groups promoting autonomy agreements with larger states possibly existed since the &lt;a href=\"Inca%20Empire\"&gt;Inca Empire&lt;/a&gt; and such sentiments of independence have continued among local communities to current times.\nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs).\nIn the early 1970s and 1980s many grass-roots organizations emerged in Peru. They were concerned with problems of local people and poverty reduction. Solaris Peru, Traperos de Emus San Agustin, APRODE PERU, C\u00e1ritas del Per\u00fa, and the American organisation CARE, with their Peruvian location, fight to address poverty in their communities with different approaches, depending on the organisation. In 2000 they played an important role in the &lt;a href=\"decentralisation\"&gt;decentralisation&lt;/a&gt; process. Their hope was that power would be divided clearly between national and local governments and the latter would be able to address social justice and the concerns of local people better than the national government could. Some &lt;a href=\"NGO\"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;-members even became part of local governments. There is debate extent to which this engagement in politics contributes to the attainment of their original goals.\nInternational policy.\nPeru or Peruvian organizations participate in the following international organizations:"
