    "text": "The melanocortins are a group of &lt;a href=\"peptide%20hormone\"&gt;peptide hormone&lt;/a&gt;s which include &lt;a href=\"adrenocorticotropic%20hormone\"&gt;adrenocorticotropic hormone&lt;/a&gt; (ACTH) and the different forms of &lt;a href=\"melanocyte-stimulating%20hormone\"&gt;melanocyte-stimulating hormone&lt;/a&gt; (MSH), and are derived from &lt;a href=\"proopiomelanocortin\"&gt;proopiomelanocortin&lt;/a&gt; (POMC) in the &lt;a href=\"pituitary%20gland\"&gt;pituitary gland&lt;/a&gt;. The melanocortins exert their effects by binding to and activating the &lt;a href=\"melanocortin%20receptor\"&gt;melanocortin receptor&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThere are 5 melanocortin receptors (MCR) and all of them are &lt;a href=\"G%20protein%E2%80%93coupled%20receptor\"&gt;G protein\u2013coupled receptor&lt;/a&gt;s. In the brain, only MC3R and MC4R are expressed and their endogenous ligand is \u03b1-MSH. &lt;a href=\"Agouti-related%20peptide\"&gt;Agouti-related peptide&lt;/a&gt; (AgRP) is the endogenous antagonist. \nFunction.\nThe melanocortin system is one of the mammalian body's tools to regulate food intake in a push-pull fashion. The only neurons known to release melanocortins are located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Accordingly, there is a subpopulation called POMC neurons and one called AgRP neurons. When POMC neurons release \u03b1-MSH, appetite is decreased. On the other hand, when AgRP neurons release AgRP, appetite is stimulated. \n&lt;a href=\"Leptin\"&gt;Leptin&lt;/a&gt;, the energy surfeit hormone, and &lt;a href=\"Ghrelin\"&gt;Ghrelin&lt;/a&gt;, the hunger hormone, are upstream regulators of the melanocortin system in the brain. These hormones also regulate the release of peptides other than the melanocortins. Disturbance of the leptin-melanocortin pathway can lead to early onset obesity as well as various metabolic disorders and suppressed immune function. "
