    "text": "The City of Fairfax ( ), colloquially known as Fairfax City, Downtown Fairfax, Old Town Fairfax, Fairfax Courthouse, or simply Fairfax, is an &lt;a href=\"independent%20city%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;independent city&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. As of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt; the population was 22,565, which had risen to an estimated 24,019 as of 2019.\nThe City of Fairfax is an &lt;a href=\"enclave\"&gt;enclave&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by the separate political entity &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%20County%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Fairfax County&lt;/a&gt;. Fairfax City also contains an &lt;a href=\"exclave\"&gt;exclave&lt;/a&gt; of Fairfax County, the Fairfax County Court Complex.\nThe City of Fairfax and the area immediately surrounding the historical border of the City of Fairfax, collectively designated by Fairfax County as \"Fairfax\", comprise the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of Fairfax County. The city is part of the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Washington\u2013Arlington\u2013Alexandria, DC\u2013VA\u2013MD\u2013WV Metropolitan Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt; as well as a part of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Virginia\"&gt;Northern Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. The city is west of &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; The Washington Metro's &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Line%20%28Washington%20Metro%29\"&gt;Orange Line&lt;/a&gt; serves Fairfax through its &lt;a href=\"Vienna%20station%20%28Washington%20Metro%29\"&gt;Vienna station&lt;/a&gt;, which is a mile northeast of the &lt;a href=\"city%20limits\"&gt;city limits&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"CUE%20Bus\"&gt;CUE Bus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Metrobus%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29\"&gt;Metrobus&lt;/a&gt; operate in Fairfax. &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Railway%20Express\"&gt;Virginia Railway Express&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Burke%20Centre%20station\"&gt;Burke Centre station&lt;/a&gt; is situated three miles southeast of the city's boundaries. Virginia's largest public educational institution with 35,189 students in 2017 is &lt;a href=\"George%20Mason%20University\"&gt;George Mason University&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in unincorporated Fairfax County, along the city's southern border while still having a City of Fairfax address and sharing the same public transportation system.\nHistory.\nFairfax was founded on land originally occupied by indigenous people of the Siouan and Iroquoian tribes. The city derives its name from &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Fairfax%2C%206th%20Lord%20Fairfax%20of%20Cameron\"&gt;Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron&lt;/a&gt;, who was awarded of land in northern Virginia by King Charles. The area that the city now encompasses was settled in the early 18th century by farmers from Virginia's &lt;a href=\"Tidewater%20region\"&gt;Tidewater region&lt;/a&gt;. The town of \"Providence\" was established on the site by an act of the state legislature in 1805.\nThe scene of the first land battle of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Fairfax%20Court%20House%20%28June%201861%29\"&gt;Battle of Fairfax Court House&lt;/a&gt; took place here on June 1, 1861, after a &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; scouting party clashed with the local militia with neither side gaining advantage. A &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Fairfax%20Court%20House%20%28June%201863%29\"&gt;second battle&lt;/a&gt; took place here two years later on June 27, 1863, where Union troops were defeated. This battle delayed the movements of &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20Army\"&gt;Confederate&lt;/a&gt; cavalry chief &lt;a href=\"J.%20E.%20B.%20Stuart\"&gt;Jeb Stuart&lt;/a&gt; with disastrous consequences for &lt;a href=\"Robert%20E.%20Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Gettysburg\"&gt;Gettysburg&lt;/a&gt; a few days later.\nFairfax was officially renamed the \"Town of Fairfax\" in 1859. It was incorporated as a town in 1874. It was incorporated as a city in 1961 by &lt;a href=\"court%20order\"&gt;court order&lt;/a&gt;. Under Virginia law the city was separated from Fairfax County yet remains the county seat. In 1904, a &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Virginia%20trolleys\"&gt;trolley line&lt;/a&gt; connected Fairfax with Washington, D.C.\nArchitecture.\nThe former Fairfax County Courthouse is the oldest historic building in Fairfax. The first Fairfax courthouse was established in 1742 near present-day &lt;a href=\"Tysons%20Corner%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Tysons Corner&lt;/a&gt;, and is the namesake for Old Courthouse Road. It intersects with Gallows Road, which today is a major commuter route, but at the time was the road where condemned prisoners were led to the &lt;a href=\"gallows\"&gt;gallows&lt;/a&gt; at the old courthouse. In 1752, the courthouse was moved to &lt;a href=\"Alexandria%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, which offered to build the new courthouse at their own expense. The reason the courthouse was moved from the Tysons Corner location was because of \"Indian hostilities\", as noted on the stone marker at the northwest corner of Gallows Road and &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20State%20Route%20123\"&gt;Route 123&lt;/a&gt;. The courthouse operated there until 1790, when Virginia ceded the land where the courthouse was located for the creation of Washington, DC. The General Assembly specified that the new courthouse should be located in the center of the county, and was established at the corner of what was Old &lt;a href=\"Little%20River%20Turnpike\"&gt;Little River Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; and is now Main Street and what was Ox Road and is now &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Bridge%20Road\"&gt;Chain Bridge Road&lt;/a&gt; on land donated by town founder Richard Ratcliffe. The courthouse changed hands repeatedly during the Civil War, and the first Confederate officer battle casualty, John Quincy Marr, occurred on its grounds. The first meeting of the Fairfax Court was held April 21, 1800.\nThe oldest two-story building in the city, the &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%20Public%20School%20%28Old%20Fairfax%20Elementary%20School%20Annex%29\"&gt;Fairfax Public School&lt;/a&gt; was built in 1873 for $2,750. In addition to elementary school use the building has also housed special education, adult education, and police academy training. On July 4, 1992, the building became the Fairfax Museum and Visitor Center. &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Edward%20Willard\"&gt;Joseph Edward Willard&lt;/a&gt; built the town hall building in 1900 then gifted it to the then town in 1902. The Old Town Hall now houses the Huddleston Library and the Fairfax Art League.\nGeography.\nThe city of Fairfax is located close to the geographic center of Fairfax County, at (38.852612, \u221277.304377).

Forbes commended Fairfax for its strong public school system, high median salary, and a rate of sole proprietors per capita that ranks it in the top 1 percent nationwide. According to the magazine, \"These factors are increasingly important in a recession. When businesses and jobs retract, as they have nationwide, municipalities with strong environments for start-ups, and those that offer attractive amenities, are better suited to recover from economic downtimes, as there are more business activity filling the void.\"\nTop employers.\nAccording to the city's 2015 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:\nLocal government and politics.\nAs an independent city of Virginia rather than an incorporated town within a county, Fairfax derives its governing authority from the &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;Virginia General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. In order to revise the power and structure of the city government, the city must request the General Assembly to amend the charter. The present charter was granted in 1966.

After receiving a tip that he was involved in drugs-related activities online, a police detective engaged Silverthorne on an online website \"...used to arrange for casual sexual encounters between men.\" The detective then arranged a meeting with Silverthorne and two other men, in which they agreed to exchange methamphetamine. At the meeting in &lt;a href=\"Tyson%27s%20Corner%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Tyson's Corner, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, detectives performed the exchange and then arrested Silverthorne along with the two other men. He was charged with felony distribution of methamphetamine and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia. He announced his resignation on Monday, August 8, 2016, in a letter to the City Council.\nDespite news media seizing the salacious \"drugs-for-sex\" aspect of the story, Silverthorne maintains that he was not distributing methamphetamine \"for sex,\" and he was not tried for any sexual crimes.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nThe public schools in the City of Fairfax are owned by the city, but administered by the &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%20County%20Public%20Schools\"&gt;Fairfax County Public Schools&lt;/a&gt; system under contractual agreement with Fairfax County. &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report\"&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt; often ranks Fairfax County schools among the best in the country.
