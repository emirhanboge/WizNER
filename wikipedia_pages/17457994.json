    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Liberal Party of Australia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Party%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Party of Australia&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the Australian Country Party) have stood in Australian federal elections as a &lt;a href=\"Coalition%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt; since the Liberal Party's founding in 1944. A full merger of the parties has been debated for decades, as a result of a shrinking National Party vote. It is argued that the decline in the National vote is linked to a declining rural population, and National Party policies have become increasingly similar to those of the Liberal Party. Additionally, in the &lt;a href=\"states%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia\"&gt;states and territories of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the parties' affiliates have worked in coalition on multiple occasions. Additionally, the &lt;a href=\"Country%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Country Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Territory\"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt; has been affiliated with both parties since its formation, and in July 2008 the &lt;a href=\"National%20Party%20of%20Australia%20%E2%80%93%20Queensland\"&gt;National Party of Australia \u2013 Queensland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia%20%28Queensland%20Division%29\"&gt;Liberal Party of Australia (Queensland Division)&lt;/a&gt; merged to become the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20National%20Party%20of%20Queensland\"&gt;Liberal National Party of Queensland&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn Queensland, the only state where the Nationals were the dominant coalition partner in state politics after &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20Springborg\"&gt;Lawrence Springborg&lt;/a&gt;'s re-election as party leader, support emerged \u2013 especially on the National side \u2013 for a merger of coalition parties to address the declining National (rural) vote and Labor domination of all levels of government.\nIn March 1973, former &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"William%20McMahon\"&gt;William McMahon&lt;/a&gt; publicly announced his support for a merger. McMahon reiterated his view after Labor won the &lt;a href=\"1974%20Australian%20federal%20election\"&gt;1974 election&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Snedden\"&gt;Billy Snedden&lt;/a&gt;, his successor as leader of the Liberal Party, also stated that he favoured a merger.\nDuring the 1980s, former Nationals MP &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Nixon\"&gt;Peter Nixon&lt;/a&gt; reviewed the party and \"concluded it should seriously consider amalgamating with the Liberals\". Former Nationals leader &lt;a href=\"Doug%20Anthony\"&gt;Doug Anthony&lt;/a&gt; wrote not long afterward, \"Any objective and rational National Party member who read this report would have to accept that amalgamation was the only realistic course. Regrettably, there are still too many who don't want to read it and who don't want to face reality, that the role of a specialist party looking after the needs of rural people is in decline.\"\nIn July 1989, Senator &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Chaney\"&gt;Fred Chaney&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy leader of the Liberal Party, stated his tentative support for a merger, but noted that it could not be led by politicians and should come from the grassroots.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Australian%20federal%20election\"&gt;2007 federal election&lt;/a&gt;, the National Party's vote declined to 5.49 percent, with the party winning only 10 of 150 seats (an all-time low). Only one National seat, &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20Hinkler\"&gt;Hinkler&lt;/a&gt; in Queensland, was classified by the Australian Electoral Commission as provincial (predominantly rural), compared to four held by the Liberals and 16 by Labor. The election was indicative of declining support for the Nationals. The party's parliamentary representation fell in each of the four Australian elections between 1998 and 2007, and the party's vote in this period never exceeded 6 percent (compared to an average voting result of 8\u201311 percent for the Nationals over the previous two decades). The Nationals' vote declined further to 4.51 percent at the 2019 federal election, when you include the fact that the Queensland Nationals are counted separately."
