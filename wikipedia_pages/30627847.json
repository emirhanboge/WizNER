However, Mattsson, who was appointed by the Sports Ministry, was not recognised by the &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Leone%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Sierra Leone Football Association&lt;/a&gt;, until a meeting between the two organisations confirmed Mattsson's role as manager.\nMattsson was awarded a full-time contract in May 2012.\nOn 28 March 2013, Mattsson quit his job as manager of the Sierra Leone national team, and announced he wanted to take a break from football. However, the Sierra Leone Football Association denied knowledge of the resignation."
