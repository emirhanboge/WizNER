The logo also contains elements inspired by the tournament host country. The &lt;a href=\"maroon\"&gt;maroon&lt;/a&gt; colour of the logo is inspired by the art of the &lt;a href=\"Warli\"&gt;Warli&lt;/a&gt; people, a tribe native to the northern &lt;a href=\"Western%20Ghats\"&gt;Western Ghats&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament's host state of Maharashtra. Red and maroon colours are often used as the base of &lt;a href=\"Warli%20painting\"&gt;Warli painting&lt;/a&gt;s. The use of silver in the logo is inspired by the \"importance of silver jewellery in Indian households and the beauty and elegance of the precious metal\".\nThe official global partners of the tournament are &lt;a href=\"Continental%20AG\"&gt;Continental AG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Credit%20Saison\"&gt;Credit Saison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neom\"&gt;Neom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yili%20Group\"&gt;Yili Group&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Kelme%20%28company%29\"&gt;Kelme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Konami\"&gt;Konami&lt;/a&gt; are official global supporters."
