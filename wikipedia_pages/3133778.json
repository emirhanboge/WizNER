    "text": "Gu\u00f0mundr (&lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt;: , sometimes anglicised as Godmund) was a semi-legendary &lt;a href=\"Norsemen\"&gt;Norse&lt;/a&gt; king in &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim\"&gt;Jotunheim&lt;/a&gt;, ruling over a land called \"&lt;a href=\"Gl%C3%A6sisvellir\"&gt;Gl\u00e6sisvellir&lt;/a&gt;\", which was known as the warrior's paradise.\nGu\u00f0mundr appears in the following &lt;a href=\"legendary%20saga\"&gt;legendary saga&lt;/a&gt;s:\nHe also appears in &lt;a href=\"Saxo%20Grammaticus\"&gt;Saxo Grammaticus&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"Gesta%20Danorum\"&gt;Gesta Danorum&lt;/a&gt;\" (Book VIII) and in \"&lt;a href=\"Samsons%20saga%20fagra\"&gt;Samsons saga fagra&lt;/a&gt;\", one of the &lt;a href=\"chivalric%20sagas\"&gt;chivalric sagas&lt;/a&gt;.\nGu\u00f0mundr shared the same name with his father; \"&lt;a href=\"%C3%9Alfh%C3%A9%C3%B0inn\"&gt;\u00dalfh\u00e9\u00f0inn&lt;/a&gt;\" was added to the son's name to differentiate father from son. According to some sources, Gu\u00f0mundr \u00dalfh\u00e9\u00f0inn's son was &lt;a href=\"Hei%C3%B0rekr\"&gt;Hei\u00f0rekr&lt;/a&gt; \u00dalfhamr. However, in \"&lt;a href=\"Hervarar%20saga%20ok%20Hei%C3%B0reks\"&gt;Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks&lt;/a&gt;\" Gu\u00f0mundr's son was &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B6fund\"&gt;H\u00f6fund&lt;/a&gt;, who married &lt;a href=\"Hervor\"&gt;Hervor&lt;/a&gt;, and their sons were &lt;a href=\"Angant%C3%BDr\"&gt;Angant\u00fdr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hei%C3%B0rekr\"&gt;Hei\u00f0rekr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Saxo%20Grammaticus\"&gt;Saxo Grammaticus&lt;/a&gt;, in \"&lt;a href=\"Gesta%20Danorum\"&gt;Gesta Danorum&lt;/a&gt;\" , referred to Gu\u00f0mundr Ulfhe\u00f0inn as \"Guthmundus\", calling him a giant and the brother of \"Geruthus\" (&lt;a href=\"Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r\"&gt;Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r&lt;/a&gt;).\nHe is sometimes given the epithet \"faxi\", 'the one with a mane', i.e., a horse. This suggests a connection with the army of the dead who roam Norway at &lt;a href=\"Yule\"&gt;Yule&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Oskorei\"&gt;Oskorei&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Otto%20H%C3%B6fler\"&gt;Otto H\u00f6fler&lt;/a&gt;, drawing on earlier theories of Nils Lid, argued that it was actually a word found in modern Norwegian dialect as both \"fax\" and \"faxe\" and referring to a kind of grass, and that it referred to the fertility symbol of the sheaf in Norwegian Yule celebrations. According to \"Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks\", the Norwegians came to see Gu\u00f0mundr as a god; H\u00f6fler argued that in both the wolf-form suggested by \"\u00dalfh\u00e9\u00f0inn\" and the horse-form suggested by \"faxi\", Gu\u00f0mundr was a death-demon and his death-horse the prototype of the death-horse &lt;a href=\"Sleipnir\"&gt;Sleipnir&lt;/a&gt; portrayed on the &lt;a href=\"Picture%20stone\"&gt;Gotland picture stone&lt;/a&gt;s. \nIngemar Nordgren regards the first Gu\u00f0mundr as \"a cult-god\" and his son, the Gu\u00f0mundr of the sagas, as portraying him in &lt;a href=\"theriomorphic\"&gt;theriomorphic&lt;/a&gt; form, and suggests that he is either an earlier fertility god who came to be identified with &lt;a href=\"%C3%93%C3%B0inn\"&gt;\u00d3\u00f0inn&lt;/a&gt; and that Gl\u00e6sisvellir was influenced by &lt;a href=\"Valhalla\"&gt;Valhalla&lt;/a&gt;, or that he is a local variant of a precursor of \u00d3\u00f0inn.\nGu\u00f0mundr and the &lt;a href=\"Lombards\"&gt;Lombards&lt;/a&gt; are said to have battled &lt;a href=\"Helgi\"&gt;Helgi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sinfj%C3%B6tli\"&gt;Sinfj\u00f6tli&lt;/a&gt;; it is Gu\u00f0mundr who engages in the &lt;a href=\"flyting\"&gt;flyting&lt;/a&gt; with Sinfj\u00f6tli from shore in &lt;a href=\"Helgakvi%C3%B0a%20Hundingsbana%20I\"&gt;Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I&lt;/a&gt;. The latter are called the &lt;a href=\"Ylfing\"&gt;Ylfing&lt;/a&gt;s, the 'wolf clan'. As H\u00f6fler noted, both armies are spoken of as animals, and &lt;a href=\"Paulus%20Diaconus\"&gt;Paulus Diaconus&lt;/a&gt; identifies the Lombards with mares with white bands around their legs symbolising fetters (they did in fact bind their legs with white bands). Since \u00d3\u00f0inn is patron of the Lombards, this is another Odinic connection.\n&lt;a href=\"Einar%20%C3%93lafur%20Sveinsson\"&gt;Einar \u00d3lafur Sveinsson&lt;/a&gt; thought Gu\u00f0mundr was Irish in origin while Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r was native Scandinavian."
