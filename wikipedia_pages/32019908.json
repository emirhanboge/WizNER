    "text": "A quintain or pentastich is any &lt;a href=\"poetic\"&gt;poetic&lt;/a&gt; form containing five lines. Examples include the &lt;a href=\"tanka\"&gt;tanka&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"cinquain\"&gt;cinquain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Quintilla%20%28poetry%29\"&gt;quintilla&lt;/a&gt;, Shakespeare's &lt;a href=\"Sonnet%2099\"&gt;Sonnet 99&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"limerick%20%28poetry%29\"&gt;limerick&lt;/a&gt;.\nExample.\n &lt;poem&gt;\n Sonnet 99, the first stanza:\nThe forward violet thus did I chide:\nSweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells\nIf not from my love\u2019s breath? The purple pride\nWhich on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells,\nIn my love\u2019s veins thou hast too grossly dyed.\n --&lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\n Autumn Song\n Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf \n How the heart feels a languid grief \n Laid on it for a covering, \n And how sleep seems a goodly thing \n In Autumn at the fall of the leaf?\n And how the swift beat of the brain \n Falters because it is in vain, \n In Autumn at the fall of the leaf \n Knowest thou not? and how the chief \n Of joys seems\u2014not to suffer pain?\n Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf \n How the soul feels like a dried sheaf \n Bound up at length for harvesting, \n And how death seems a comely thing \n In Autumn at the fall of the leaf?\n --&lt;a href=\"Dante%20Gabriel%20Rossetti\"&gt;Dante Gabriel Rossetti&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/poem&gt;"
