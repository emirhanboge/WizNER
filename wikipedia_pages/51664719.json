Its successor, the Mistery of Free Brewers, were granted the right by the Mayor and Aldermen of London to appoint Masters and Wardens in 1406. &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VI%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VI&lt;/a&gt; granted the first of a series of Royal Charters to the company in 1437\u201338. Until the last century, the company admitted non-brewers so that they could be represented by a livery company. From the mid-16th century, masters were elected annually; all of those whose names are known are listed below.\nList of masters.\nA continuous list of masters is available from the early 18th century.
