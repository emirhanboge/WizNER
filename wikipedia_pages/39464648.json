It was written by &lt;a href=\"Rhett%20Lawrence\"&gt;Rhett Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Bernard\"&gt;Crystal Bernard&lt;/a&gt; and Suzie Benson, and produced by Lawrence and Ian Devaney.\nRelease.\nIt was released as a promotional single in the United States on 5 September 1994. Therefore, it was not eligible to chart on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;. However, \"Make It Right\" reached number forty-six on the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Songs\"&gt;Hot Dance Club Songs&lt;/a&gt; chart and sixty four on the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs\"&gt;Hot R&amp;B Singles&lt;/a&gt; chart. The CD single was released in Germany on 2 October 1994 but failed to chart because of lack of promotion and no music video. \"Make It Right\" was also issued as a mini CD single in Japan on 23 November 1994. The song was remixed by &lt;a href=\"R.%20Kelly\"&gt;R. Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20%26quot%3BDope%26quot%3B%20Gonzalez\"&gt;Kenny \"Dope\" Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt; and Rhett Lawrence. \"Make It Right\" was not included on any of Stansfield's albums.\nCritical reception.\n&lt;a href=\"Larry%20Flick\"&gt;Larry Flick&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" described the song as a \"Stansfield jam that is stronger than anything she has offered in a long while.\" He noted that she \"excels amid a flurry of &lt;a href=\"New%20Jack%20Swing\"&gt;jack&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"funk\"&gt;funk&lt;/a&gt; beats and whispery backing vocals. Her fluid vocal tones flow freely over a hummable melody.\" Dave Sholin from the \"&lt;a href=\"Gavin%20Report\"&gt;Gavin Report&lt;/a&gt;\" commented, \"School's almost in session, and it coincides with release of the sequel to the \"Beverly Hills 90210\" Soundtrack: Volume 2 The College Years. Lisa Stansfield is a brilliant choice to pair with this song. &lt;a href=\"R.%20Kelly\"&gt;R. Kelly&lt;/a&gt;'s re-mix is the one for Top 40.\"\nTrack listings.\nGerman CD maxi single\nJapanese CD single\nUS promotional CD single\nUS promotional CD maxi single"
