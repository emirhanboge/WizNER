    "text": "Debeli Rti\u010d (, ) is a cape in the northern &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt; on the border between &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. It is located north-west of the Slovenian town of &lt;a href=\"Ankaran\"&gt;Ankaran&lt;/a&gt;, and west of the Italian town of &lt;a href=\"Muggia\"&gt;Muggia&lt;/a&gt;. The name (both in Slovene and Italian) literally means 'Thick Little Cape'.\nLocation and geology.\nDebeli Rti\u010d is located on the west end of the &lt;a href=\"Muggia\"&gt;Muggia&lt;/a&gt; peninsula, pointing toward northwest. The wide ridge of the cape elevates towards east into Jurjev hrib (George's hill), and gains altitude of 70 meters above sea. Its tip on the west end is characterised by &lt;a href=\"flysch\"&gt;flysch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cliff\"&gt;cliff&lt;/a&gt;s raging from 12 to 21 metres in height, and below them a narrow abrasion terrace. The gradual erosion of the cliffs erodes about 1\u20132\u00a0cm every year.\nDemographics and economy.\nDue to relatively shallow water around the cape and various natural obstacles in the sea it was impossible to build a port anywhere on the cape, so very few decided to live there, however the place was later used as fields to produce food, which remains up to this day.\nThe inner land of the cape is dominated by vineyards in ownership of &lt;a href=\"Vinakoper\"&gt;Vinakoper&lt;/a&gt;. The Vinakoper company maintains a tradition of cabernet-growing since 1955. The park proved suitable for wine-growing as the quantity of products is significantly bigger than the counterparts in other nearby regions.\nNatural monument.\nSince 1991, part of the cape is protected as a &lt;a href=\"natural%20monument\"&gt;natural monument&lt;/a&gt;, which is also home to the only &lt;a href=\"salt%20meadow\"&gt;salt meadow&lt;/a&gt; on the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. It is forbidden to build anything there. The natural monument area spans on . It covers about of coastline around the western edge, including the cliffs and the abrasion terrace. The area also includes the sea area of belt along the coastline, and the small forest of about 50 trees."
