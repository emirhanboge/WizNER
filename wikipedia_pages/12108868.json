This tree is &lt;a href=\"scientific%20name\"&gt;known botanically&lt;/a&gt; as \"&lt;a href=\"Handroanthus%20impetiginosus\"&gt;Handroanthus impetiginosus&lt;/a&gt;\", but was formerly known by various other &lt;a href=\"botanical%20name\"&gt;botanical name&lt;/a&gt;s such as \"Tabebuia avellanedae\". Lapachol is also found in other species of \"Handroanthus\".\nLapachol is usually encountered as a yellow, skin-irritating powder from wood. Chemically, it is a derivative of &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20K\"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce studied as a possible treatment for some types of cancer, it is now considered too toxic for use."
