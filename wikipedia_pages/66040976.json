    "text": "Charlotte Independence Soccer Club, sometimes referred to as Charlotte Independence II, is a soccer club from &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Hill%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Rock Hill, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; that competes in the Deep South Division of &lt;a href=\"USL%20League%20Two\"&gt;USL League Two&lt;/a&gt;. They are the affiliate of &lt;a href=\"USL%20Championship\"&gt;USL Championship&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20Independence\"&gt;Charlotte Independence&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the similar name and using the same logo, they are a separately owned and operated club from the professional team, instead merely affiliated with them.\nThe club was formed following the merger of &lt;a href=\"Discoveries%20SC\"&gt;Discoveries SC&lt;/a&gt;, Carolina Rapids, and Lake Norman SC to form the Charlotte Independence Soccer Club which will serve as the affiliate club for the &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20Independence\"&gt;Charlotte Independence&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"USL%20Championship\"&gt;USL Championship&lt;/a&gt;. They will take the league spot that Discoveries previously occupied. They were set to begin play in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20USL%20League%20Two%20season\"&gt;2020 USL League Two season&lt;/a&gt;, however, the season was cancelled due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;."
