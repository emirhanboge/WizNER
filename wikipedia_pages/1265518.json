He is the former alderman in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20City%20Council\"&gt;City Council&lt;/a&gt; representing the &lt;a href=\"40th%20Ward%2C%20Chicago\"&gt;40th Ward&lt;/a&gt; on the North Side of the city. He was first elected in 1983 at age 28. His tenure ended in May 2019 after his loss to challenger &lt;a href=\"Andre%20Vasquez\"&gt;Andre Vasquez&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Chicago%20aldermanic%20elections%2340th%20ward\"&gt;2019 Chicago aldermanic elections&lt;/a&gt;. O'Connor was an unsuccessful candidate in the Democratic Party primary election for &lt;a href=\"Illinois%27s%205th%20congressional%20district%20special%20election%2C%202009\"&gt;Illinois's 5th congressional district special election, 2009&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nO'Connor is the son of a Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Streets and Sanitation, Bureau of Equipment Services, under Chicago Mayor &lt;a href=\"Richard%20J.%20Daley\"&gt;Richard J. Daley&lt;/a&gt;.\nO'Connor graduated from Loyola University of Chicago School of Law in 1979. Fresh from law school, O'Connor successfully sued the city for back pay for his father after Mayor &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Byrne\"&gt;Jane Byrne&lt;/a&gt; fired him.\nChicago City Council (1983\u20132019).\nO'Connor was first elected alderman for the &lt;a href=\"40th%20Ward%2C%20Chicago\"&gt;40th Ward&lt;/a&gt; in 1983. He was subsequently reelected eight times, in 1987, 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, and &lt;a href=\"2015%20Chicago%20aldermanic%20election%2340th%20Ward\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"2019%20Chicago%20aldermanic%20election%2340th%20ward\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, he was denied a tenth term on the City Council, being unseated by challenger Andre Vasquez.\nCouncil Wars.\nDuring the tenure of Mayor &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Washington\"&gt;Harold Washington&lt;/a&gt;, who was &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, O'Connor, who is &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, caucused with the mostly-white opposition block in City Council known as the &lt;a href=\"Council%20Wars\"&gt;\"Vrdolyak 29\"&lt;/a&gt;. O'Connor chaired the City Council's Committee on Education as a freshman alderman.\nInvestigations and controversies.\nIn his first term a federal grand jury investigated O'Connor for providing, in late 1983 and again in late 1984, year-end jobs on the Education Committee staff for fifteen persons, including his mother-in-law, his brother-in-law, his sister-in-law, wives of two former members of his law firm, and the wife of a former staff aide. Some of those hired admitted they did not realize they were on the City payroll. \"&lt;a href=\"All%20in%20the%20Family\"&gt;All in the Family&lt;/a&gt;\" was a popular name for O'Connor's hiring practices, and O'Connor became known as the \"City Hall &lt;a href=\"Santa\"&gt;Santa&lt;/a&gt;.\" O'Connor compared his hiring practices to those of &lt;a href=\"British%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Britain's royal family&lt;/a&gt;. When asked at a City Hall news conference if the practice amounted to &lt;a href=\"nepotism\"&gt;nepotism&lt;/a&gt;, O'Connor said: \"Absolutely. I think nepotism is a system that has been around a long time. It has worked very well in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think it's been much more of a problem here.\"\nIn 2008 O'Connor was found to be one of seven Chicago aldermen who between them got ten of their children good-paying summer jobs with the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Water%20Reclamation%20District%20of%20Greater%20Chicago\"&gt;Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May 2013, O'Connor suggested that the Catholic Church and other religious institutions and not for profit organizations should pay property taxes and be billed for water provided by the City of Chicago. O'Connor's comments were in support of a plan by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to charge such organizations for water which had traditionally been provided without charge to not for profit organizations. \u201cThe silliest things can be said and people latch onto it.\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cFor Chrissake, we sell everybody water! And now all of a sudden because we\u2019re a church, we\u2019re not supposed to sell them water? At some point, i think what\u2019s gonna happen is someone\u2019s gonna say how about looking at property taxes? We\u2019ll give ya free water. How about paying for the property you own.\u201d O'Connor further suggested that the Catholic Church should not criticize the plan to bill it for water use, but ought to address its clerical abuse scandals.\nO'Connor is married to Barbara O'Connor, a &lt;a href=\"real%20estate%20broker\"&gt;real estate broker&lt;/a&gt;. In the last decade Barbara has built a successful business selling houses and &lt;a href=\"Condominium\"&gt;condos&lt;/a&gt;, many of which could not have been built without &lt;a href=\"zoning\"&gt;zoning&lt;/a&gt; changes enacted by the city council. Barbara sold more than $22 million worth of houses and condos in the 40th ward after the projects were enabled by Alderman O'Connor.\nUnsuccessful campaigns for other offices.\n&lt;a href=\"1990%20Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois%20elections%23State%27s%20Attorney%20%28special%20election%29\"&gt;In 1990&lt;/a&gt;, O'Connor was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Cecil%20Partee\"&gt;Cecil Partee&lt;/a&gt; in a four-way race for the Democratic nomination for Cook County State's Attorney in the Democratic primary on March 20, 1990, with Partee garnering 49% of the vote to O'Connor's 37.5%.\nO'Connor was defeated in his challenge to &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; incumbent Jack O'Malley in a campaign for Cook County State's Attorney in &lt;a href=\"1992%20Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois%20elections%23State%27s%20Attorney\"&gt;the general election of November 3, 1992&lt;/a&gt;, with O'Malley garnering 62% of the vote to O'Connor's 38%. O'Connor lost to O'Malley in O'Connor's own ward, 8,516 to 9,363.\n&lt;a href=\"2009%20Illinois%27s%205th%20congressional%20district%20special%20election%23Democratic%20Party%20primary\"&gt;On Tuesday, March 3, 2009&lt;/a&gt;, O'Connor finished fifth in a 12-way race in the &lt;a href=\"primary%20election\"&gt;primary election&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; nomination for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"By-election\"&gt;special election&lt;/a&gt; called to replace US Rep. &lt;a href=\"Rahm%20Emanuel\"&gt;Rahm Emanuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Illinois%27s%205th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;Illinois's 5th congressional district&lt;/a&gt;."
