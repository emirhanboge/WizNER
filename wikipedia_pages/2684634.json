    "text": "Isla Clari\u00f3n, formerly called Santa Rosa, is the second largest, westernmost and most remote of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Revillagigedo%20Islands\"&gt;Revillagigedo Islands&lt;/a&gt;. The island is located west of &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20Island\"&gt;Socorro Island&lt;/a&gt; and over from the Mexican mainland.\nIt has an area of and three prominent peaks. The westernmost and tallest peak, \"Monte Gallegos\", is high. The central peak is called \"Monte de la Marina\", , and the eastern peak Pico de la Tienda . The coasts are backed by perpendicular cliffs, high, with the exception of the middle part of the southern coast in the vicinity of \"Bah\u00eda Azufre\" (Sulphur Bay), which is the location of a small military garrison with a contingent of 9 soldiers.\nTwo small and at least temporarily &lt;a href=\"Brackish%20water\"&gt;brackish&lt;/a&gt; pools are the only source of &lt;a href=\"fresh%20water\"&gt;fresh water&lt;/a&gt;; even these may dry up in summers with little rain.\nHistory.\nClari\u00f3n Island was visited in late 1542 by the Spanish navigator &lt;a href=\"Ruy%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Villalobos\"&gt;Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos&lt;/a&gt;, but with the exception of a possible re-sighting of the Revillagigedos by Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Ladrillero before 1574 and a short-lived residence by the adventurer Mart\u00edn Y\u00e1\u00f1ez de Armida on the island he later renamed Socorro (1606), the archipelago was neglected by the Spaniards. &lt;a href=\"Joris%20van%20Spilbergen\"&gt;Joris van Spilbergen&lt;/a&gt;'s sighting of the whole group in December 1615 seems not to have been noted in Spain or its American colonies.\nClarion was sighted again by the English privateer &lt;a href=\"George%20Shelvocke\"&gt;George Shelvocke&lt;/a&gt; on the \"Speedwell\", August 21, 1721.\nThe name of the island goes back to the American brig \"Clarion\", Capt. Henry Gyzelaar, who was engaged in the North Pacific trade around 1820.\nEcology.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"topography\"&gt;topography&lt;/a&gt; of Clari\u00f3n lacks any prominent peaks that could induce rains like Cerro Evermann on &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20Island\"&gt;Socorro Island&lt;/a&gt;, the island is &lt;a href=\"semiarid\"&gt;semiarid&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"arid\"&gt;arid&lt;/a&gt; all over. Consequently, the whole of the island is covered in &lt;a href=\"shrubland\"&gt;shrubland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grassland\"&gt;grassland&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Opuntia\"&gt;Opuntia&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;. Far away from land, &lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"taxa\"&gt;taxa&lt;/a&gt; are fewer than on Socorro but like there mainly consist of landbirds and plants. &lt;a href=\"Rabbit\"&gt;Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"feral\"&gt;feral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; are found on the island and have caused serious harm to the local vegetation; pigs introduced in 1979 have caused harm to the local &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;. Native &lt;a href=\"vertebrate\"&gt;vertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s \u2013 except birds \u2013 are limited to two snake species and one &lt;a href=\"Iguania\"&gt;iguanid&lt;/a&gt; lizard species, both endemic.\nA few &lt;a href=\"seabird\"&gt;seabird&lt;/a&gt; species breed on Clari\u00f3n or formerly did so. The island is near the north(east)ern limit of the breeding range of several of these, but their continued presence needs confirmation:\nFor reasons not fully known, Clari\u00f3n seems to be more attractive to &lt;a href=\"shorebird\"&gt;shorebird&lt;/a&gt;s and other vagrant or &lt;a href=\"bird%20migration\"&gt;migrant&lt;/a&gt; birds than Socorro; perhaps this is due to the presence of &lt;a href=\"red-tailed%20hawk\"&gt;red-tailed hawk&lt;/a&gt;s on the latter island. &lt;a href=\"Great%20blue%20heron\"&gt;Great blue heron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20egret\"&gt;snowy egret&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"white-faced%20ibis\"&gt;white-faced ibis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20golden%20plover\"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt; and possibly &lt;a href=\"American%20golden%20plover\"&gt;American golden plover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spotted%20sandpiper\"&gt;spotted sandpiper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wandering%20tattler\"&gt;wandering tattler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ruddy%20turnstone\"&gt;ruddy turnstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"black-necked%20stilt\"&gt;black-necked stilt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"western%20gull\"&gt;western gull&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"barn%20swallow\"&gt;barn swallow&lt;/a&gt; are examples of the species that can be encountered on Clari\u00f3n with some regularity; most of the shorebirds congregate in the sheltered shallows of Sulphur Bay. Others, such as &lt;a href=\"blue-winged%20teal\"&gt;blue-winged teal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"western%20sandpiper\"&gt;western sandpiper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"least%20sandpiper\"&gt;least sandpiper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"short-eared%20owl\"&gt;short-eared owl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"belted%20kingfisher\"&gt;belted kingfisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"northern%20mockingbird\"&gt;northern mockingbird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"brown-headed%20cowbird\"&gt;brown-headed cowbird&lt;/a&gt; have only been recorded on very few occasions, sometimes only once.\nEndemic animals.\nIn addition, the local population of the &lt;a href=\"western%20raven\"&gt;western raven&lt;/a&gt; (\"Corvus corax sinuatus\" or \"C. sinuatus\") was formerly considered a distinct subspecies \"clarionensis\", but this is not usually accepted at present. It can be expected that this question will soon be resolved as there is currently renewed interest in the &lt;a href=\"phylogeny\"&gt;phylogeny&lt;/a&gt; of the common/western/&lt;a href=\"Chihuahuan%20raven\"&gt;Chihuahuan raven&lt;/a&gt;s. If the Revillagigedos population is indeed distinct, it might be endemic of Clari\u00f3n as the only other local &lt;a href=\"subpopulation\"&gt;subpopulation&lt;/a&gt;, on San Benedicto, was destroyed by a volcanic eruption on August 1, 1952; on the other hand, mainland birds have sometimes been assigned to \"clarionensis\" also.\nThe Clari\u00f3n population of the &lt;a href=\"critically%20endangered\"&gt;critically endangered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Townsend%27s%20shearwater\"&gt;Townsend's shearwater&lt;/a&gt; (\"Puffinus auricularis\") was probably extirpated in 1988 due to the feral pigs' depredations on the young and nesting birds.\nPlants.\nEndemic plant taxa of Clari\u00f3n are:\n&lt;a href=\"Brickellia%20peninsularis\"&gt;\"Brickellia peninsularis\" var. \"amphithalassa\"&lt;/a&gt;\"Bulbostylis nesiotica\", \"Cheilanthes peninsularis\" var. \"insularis\", \"Cyperus duripes\", \"Euphorbia anthonyi\", \"Nicotiana stocktonii\", \"Perityle socorrosensis\", \"Spermacoce nesiotica\" and \"Zapoteca formosa\" ssp. \"rosei\" are Revillagigedo endemics which Clari\u00f3n shares with either San Benedicto or Socorro. Whether \"Teucrium townsendii\" var. \"townsendii\" is the same plant as on San Benedicto is not conclusively determined.\nThere has not been recent dedicated research on the impact the sheep and rabbits had on the local &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt;. While no plants seem to have gone &lt;a href=\"extinct\"&gt;extinct&lt;/a&gt; on the other Revillagigedo Islands, Clari\u00f3n is one most heavily affected by introduced &lt;a href=\"herbivore\"&gt;herbivore&lt;/a&gt;s."
