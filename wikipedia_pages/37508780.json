    "text": "Buford Mountain Conservation Area consists of north of &lt;a href=\"Ironton%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Ironton&lt;/a&gt; and southwest of &lt;a href=\"Bismarck%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Bismarck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. The area includes Buford Mountain at above sea level. The mountain consists mostly of &lt;a href=\"rhyolite\"&gt;rhyolite&lt;/a&gt;, with few permanent water sources. However, there are eight fishless ponds each about in size.\nThe central feature, Buford Mountain, has the name of the local Buford family who settled the area. The &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20Department%20of%20Conservation\"&gt;Missouri Department of Conservation&lt;/a&gt; purchased the area from the &lt;a href=\"Nature%20Conservancy\"&gt;Nature Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. There is a hiking trail that traverses the area for and crosses the summit of Buford Mountain. Hunting is permitted in the area in the appropriate season with permits."
