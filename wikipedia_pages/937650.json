    "title": "Liberalism and centrism in Estonia",
    "text": "This article gives an overview of liberalism and centrism in &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;. It is limited to &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"centrist\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign \u21d2 denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that the party has labeled itself as a liberal party.\nHistory.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century liberal parties emerged and played an important role in Estonia. They lost influence in the 1930s.\nAfter the restoration of independence in 1990, both pragmatic centrist and liberal forces arose. The &lt;a href=\"Estonian%20Reform%20Party\"&gt;Estonian Reform Party&lt;/a&gt; (\"Eesti Reformierakond\") is a free market liberal party. Despite its liberal international affiliations the &lt;a href=\"Estonian%20Centre%20Party\"&gt;Estonian Centre Party&lt;/a&gt; (\"Eesti Keskerakond\") is generally not considered a liberal party, so therefore it is not included."
