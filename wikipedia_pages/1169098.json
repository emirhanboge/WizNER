It was disbanded the same year, when &lt;a href=\"%C5%8Ckubo%20Toshimichi\"&gt;\u014ckubo Toshimichi&lt;/a&gt; promised Itagaki that the government would draft a &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen no constitution had appeared by September 1878, Itagaki revived the \"Aikokusha\" and renamed it the &lt;a href=\"League%20for%20the%20Establishment%20of%20a%20National%20Assembly\"&gt;League for the Establishment of a National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. Its primary purpose was to petition the government to establish a &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Meiji%20Japan%23Establishment%20of%20a%20national%20assembly\"&gt;national assembly&lt;/a&gt;. It was renamed &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Japan%20%281881%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;, which Itagaki founded in October 1881.\nThe \"Aikokusha\" should not be confused with the \"&lt;a href=\"Aikoku%20K%C5%8Dt%C5%8D\"&gt;Aikoku K\u014dt\u014d&lt;/a&gt;\", or with various later &lt;a href=\"Uyoku%20dantai\"&gt;ultranationalist&lt;/a&gt; movements with similar names."
