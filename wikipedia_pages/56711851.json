He was shot to death by the &lt;a href=\"SS\"&gt;SS&lt;/a&gt; in , northwest of Leipzig, and thrown in a pit together with 52 other German and foreign anti-fascists on 12 April 1945, just a week before the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Army\"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; entered Leipzig.\nThe street in the S\u00fcdvorstadt borough of Leipzig where Alfred K\u00e4stner lived was renamed Alfred-K\u00e4stner-Stra\u00dfe on 1 August 1945."
