    "text": "Thomas Carney (ca 1830 \u2013 1905) was an &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;-born inventor and political figure in &lt;a href=\"Manitoba\"&gt;Manitoba&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. He represented &lt;a href=\"Emerson%20%28electoral%20district%29\"&gt;Emerson&lt;/a&gt; from 1880 to 1883 in the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Manitoba\"&gt;Legislative Assembly of Manitoba&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Manitoba\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Bradford County, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and was educated there. Carney married Mary Ann Kaufelt. In 1873, he came to Manitoba and, with William Newton Fairbanks, founded the town of &lt;a href=\"Emerson%2C%20Manitoba\"&gt;Emerson&lt;/a&gt;. Carney was mayor of Emerson from 1880 to 1883. He was elected to the Manitoba assembly in an 1880 by-election held after &lt;a href=\"William%20Nash%20%28Manitoba%20politician%29\"&gt;William Nash&lt;/a&gt; was named registrar. While in Emerson, he developed an idea for a \"coin changer\" (&lt;a href=\"cash%20register\"&gt;cash register&lt;/a&gt;). In 1884, he left Emerson to join the &lt;a href=\"NCR%20Corporation\"&gt;National Cash Register&lt;/a&gt; company. Carney died in &lt;a href=\"Dayton%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Dayton, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;."
