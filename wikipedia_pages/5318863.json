    "text": "XHSON-FM is a &lt;a href=\"Electronic%20dance%20music\"&gt;EDM&lt;/a&gt; radio station in &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; owned and operated by NRM Comunicaciones. Its 4 regular presenters and 31 resident DJs (alongside several additional guest DJs from time to time) host the station's 24-hour mix of &lt;a href=\"Electro%20house\"&gt;electro-house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"techno\"&gt;techno&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trance%20music\"&gt;trance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"progressive%20house\"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drum%20and%20bass\"&gt;drum and bass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dubstep\"&gt;dubstep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breakbeat\"&gt;breaks&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Dance%20music\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt; music. It also plays &lt;a href=\"Chill-out%20music\"&gt;chill-out&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lounge%20music\"&gt;lounge music&lt;/a&gt; 13 hours a week.\nHistory.\nThe history of 100.9 FM in Mexico City begins with Televideo, S.A., receiving a concession for XEOY-FM in 1957. However, the station didn't come to air until April 18, 1968, with the on-air name of \"La Chica Musical\". In the mid-1970s, the station became known as \"Sonomil\" (a name derived both from its position at 100.9 FM and from &lt;a href=\"XEOY-AM\"&gt;XEOY-AM&lt;/a&gt; 1000). This name was enshrined in the station's callsign when it became XHSON-FM in 1978.\nThe format moved toward rock in 1983 and 1984; the station took on the name of Proyecto 101 late in 1983 and then Rock 101 in 1984. The calls changed to XHROK-FM.\nHowever, due to low ratings and changes within N\u00facleo Radio Mil, it was decided to flip formats and become \"C\u00f3digo 100.9\" with techno music, with the callsign returning to XHSON-FM.\nIn 1999, the Sabrosita tropical music format moved to 100.9 FM from &lt;a href=\"XEPH-AM\"&gt;XEPH-AM&lt;/a&gt; 590. The format moved back to AM in 2004, at which time 100.9 FM took on its current format.\nIt was the only Dance Contemporary radio station in Mexico, with most of its listeners in Mexico City and &lt;a href=\"Cuernavaca\"&gt;Cuernavaca&lt;/a&gt;, up until 2008 when N\u00facleo Radio Monterrey launched &lt;a href=\"XHCHL-FM\"&gt;a sister station in Monterrey&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2021, the station rebranded as \"Beat Digital.\""
