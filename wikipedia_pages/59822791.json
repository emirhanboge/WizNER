    "title": "Progress D-236",
    "text": "The Progress D-236 was an experimental aircraft engine, a hybrid between a &lt;a href=\"turbofan\"&gt;turbofan&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"turboprop\"&gt;turboprop&lt;/a&gt; known as a &lt;a href=\"propfan\"&gt;propfan&lt;/a&gt;. Also known as the Lotarev D-236T, the three-shaft geared engine was designed in the 1980s and 1990s to power proposed propfan aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Tupolev%20Tu-334\"&gt;Tupolev Tu-334&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ilyushin\"&gt;Ilyushin&lt;/a&gt; Il-118, and Ilyushin Il-88. \nBased on the core of the Ukrainian &lt;a href=\"Lotarev%20D-36\"&gt;Progress D-36&lt;/a&gt; turbofan, the D-236 was the first Soviet propfan, and as of 2019 it is still one of only four different unshrouded, contra-rotating propfan engines to have flown in service or in flight testing.\nDesign and development.\nThe D-236, an engine with unshrouded &lt;a href=\"contra-rotating\"&gt;contra-rotating&lt;/a&gt; propellers, was first investigated in 1979 as the powerplant for the first version of the Ukrainian &lt;a href=\"Antonov%20An-70\"&gt;Antonov An-70&lt;/a&gt;. The front propeller was tested on the &lt;a href=\"Antonov%20An-32\"&gt;Antonov An-32&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"military%20transport%20aircraft\"&gt;military transport aircraft&lt;/a&gt; in 1980, as the An-32's normal &lt;a href=\"Ivchenko%20AI-20\"&gt;Ivchenko AI-20&lt;/a&gt;DM engines had about half the rated power of the D-236. However, the anticipated improvements in takeoff performance and noise reduction did not materialize. The noise at cruise speeds reached 115 to 120 decibels, which was even higher than the noise levels produced by the lighter Aerosila AV-68DM propellers typically attached on the AI-20DM. The increased noise affected radio communications and crew working conditions, so the propeller testing was quickly ended.\nAn early version of the &lt;a href=\"contra-rotating%20propeller\"&gt;contra-rotating propeller&lt;/a&gt;s for the D-236 engine was shown at the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Air%20Show\"&gt;Paris Air Show&lt;/a&gt; in June 1985. At that time, the propellers had 16 blades with a diameter of . The blades had a &lt;a href=\"glass%20fiber\"&gt;glass fiber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carbon%20fiber\"&gt;carbon fiber&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"composite%20materials\"&gt;composite&lt;/a&gt; shell over a metal &lt;a href=\"Spar%20%28aeronautics%29\"&gt;spar&lt;/a&gt;, and they had about 45 degrees of twist. The propellers would rotate at 1,100 &lt;a href=\"rpm\"&gt;rpm&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"takeoff\"&gt;takeoff&lt;/a&gt; and 960 rpm at &lt;a href=\"Cruise%20%28aeronautics%29\"&gt;cruise&lt;/a&gt;. Soviet engineers claimed that the engine would be delivered by 1989 and help &lt;a href=\"Antonov\"&gt;Antonov&lt;/a&gt; airliners meet the strictest U.S. &lt;a href=\"Aircraft%20noise%20pollution\"&gt;community noise&lt;/a&gt; standards, although they were still working on a solution to lower &lt;a href=\"Aircraft%20noise%20pollution%23Cabin%20noise\"&gt;cabin noise&lt;/a&gt;. The gently curved blades were efficient up to a speed of &lt;a href=\"Mach%20number\"&gt;Mach&lt;/a&gt; 0.7, which led some American engineers to claim that the &lt;a href=\"contra-rotating%20propeller\"&gt;contra-rotating propeller&lt;/a&gt; was not fast enough to be a propfan, and that it was simply an advanced propeller. The propfan/advanced propeller would power an unspecified &lt;a href=\"Antonov\"&gt;Antonov&lt;/a&gt; airliner and be connected to the D-236 engine, which would be rated at . The engine was scheduled to start &lt;a href=\"flight%20test\"&gt;flight test&lt;/a&gt;s by the end of the year.\nFlight tests.\nHowever, the engine didn't fly until it was mounted on an &lt;a href=\"Ilyushin%20Il-76\"&gt;Ilyushin Il-76&lt;/a&gt; testbed in 1987. By June 1989, it had accumulated 50 hours of &lt;a href=\"flight%20test\"&gt;flight test&lt;/a&gt;s on the Il-76, now traveling at speeds up to Mach 0.75 with good efficiency. The D-236 used the &lt;a href=\"gas%20generator\"&gt;gas generator&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lotarev%20D-136\"&gt;Lotarev D-136&lt;/a&gt; turboshaft engine, but added a &lt;a href=\"planetary%20gearbox\"&gt;planetary gearbox&lt;/a&gt; to drive the propellers. The Lotarev D-136 debuted earlier in the decade on the &lt;a href=\"Mil%20Mi-26\"&gt;Mil Mi-26&lt;/a&gt;, the world's most powerful helicopter in production. The D-136 itself had a core that was based on the &lt;a href=\"Lotarev%20D-36\"&gt;Lotarev D-36&lt;/a&gt;, a static thrust &lt;a href=\"turbofan\"&gt;turbofan&lt;/a&gt; that entered service in the previous decade and powered the &lt;a href=\"Antonov%20An-72\"&gt;Antonov An-72&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"An-74\"&gt;An-74&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yakovlev%20Yak-42\"&gt;Yakovlev Yak-42&lt;/a&gt; Soviet airliners. A model of the propfan &lt;a href=\"testbed%20aircraft\"&gt;testbed aircraft&lt;/a&gt; was displayed at the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Air%20Show\"&gt;Paris Air Show&lt;/a&gt; that month. The Ilyushin &lt;a href=\"Il-76\"&gt;Il-76&lt;/a&gt; with the D-236 engine was also flown to the Hannover ILA 90 airshow, with the engine now having eight blades on the front propeller and six blades on the back propeller. The Soviets claimed the D-236 had a true &lt;a href=\"aerodynamic\"&gt;aerodynamic&lt;/a&gt; efficiency of 28 percent and a fuel savings of 30 percent over an equivalent &lt;a href=\"turboprop\"&gt;turboprop&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the Soviets revealed that the D-236 was intended for an unidentified four-propfan aircraft. (This aircraft was probably the An-70, which in 1990 was altered to use four &lt;a href=\"Progress%20D-27\"&gt;Progress D-27&lt;/a&gt; engines instead of the previous quad-engine D-236 configuration.) In total, the D-236 flew 36 times for a total of 70 flight test hours on the Il-76.\nThe D-236 engine also was tested in flight on a Yakovlev &lt;a href=\"Yak-42\"&gt;Yak-42&lt;/a&gt;E-LL starting on March 15, 1991. The engine now had a diameter of , a takeoff &lt;a href=\"thrust\"&gt;thrust&lt;/a&gt; of , and an output power of , although it was limited to on this testbed. The Yak-42E-LL testbed aircraft was flown to the 1991 &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Air%20Show\"&gt;Paris Air Show&lt;/a&gt; as a demonstration for the planned &lt;a href=\"Yak-46\"&gt;Yak-46&lt;/a&gt; aircraft with twin propfan engines. The D-236 test engine replaced the right-sided D-36 aft engine that normally was used on the Yak-42 aircraft. The Yak-46 would have a base capacity of 150 seats, a range of , and a cruise speed of Mach 0.75 (). The D-236 finished testing on the Yak-42E-LL testbed before the end of 1991.\nOther proposals.\nIn addition, the Soviet Union considered using D-236 &lt;a href=\"propfan\"&gt;propfan&lt;/a&gt; engines on these publicly proposed aircraft:\nAlthough in November 1991, the &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Standard\"&gt;Hamilton Standard&lt;/a&gt; propeller manufacturing division (and inventor of the &lt;a href=\"propfan\"&gt;propfan&lt;/a&gt; concept in the 1970s) of &lt;a href=\"United%20Technologies\"&gt;United Technologies&lt;/a&gt; was to meet with a Soviet aerospace delegation to discuss involvement in the D-236 project, the engine never made it into service. Only the Tu-334 was built, but it was produced with D-436 &lt;a href=\"turbofan\"&gt;turbofan&lt;/a&gt; engines instead of propfans. The &lt;a href=\"breakup%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;breakup of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; plunged the successor states into financial troubles, which prevented further development of the D-236 and aircraft that would use that powerplant. One post-Soviet aircraft would eventually enter service with propfans, but the &lt;a href=\"Antonov%20An-70\"&gt;Antonov An-70&lt;/a&gt; aircraft would instead use the &lt;a href=\"Progress%20D-27\"&gt;Progress D-27&lt;/a&gt;, which was a larger, more powerful, and more advanced propfan engine."
