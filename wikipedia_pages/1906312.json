    "text": "Boglestone (named after the Bogal Stone) is located around the top of the Clune Brae, &lt;a href=\"Port%20Glasgow\"&gt;Port Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Inverclyde\"&gt;Inverclyde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. The area includes housing, but also serves as an important 'hub' for upper Port Glasgow, offering amenities such as education, shopping, health centres, and leisure.\nThe two &lt;a href=\"school\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt;s previously situated here were Boglestone Primary a non-denominational school, and &lt;a href=\"St%20Michael\"&gt;St Michael&lt;/a&gt;'s a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; primary School. Due to the local council's education plans, Boglestone Primary was demolished, with pupils temporarily transferred to other schools, including Highholm Primary, located near Port Glasgow &lt;a href=\"town%20centre\"&gt;town centre&lt;/a&gt;. Newark Primary School (opened 2008) now stands on the site.\nShops include a &lt;a href=\"Co-op%20UK\"&gt;Co-op&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"supermarket\"&gt;supermarket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"newsagent\"&gt;newsagent&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"baker\"&gt;baker&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"Ladbrokes\"&gt;Ladbrokes&lt;/a&gt; bookmakers. A &lt;a href=\"health%20centre\"&gt;health centre&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"community%20centre\"&gt;community centre&lt;/a&gt; that includes a &lt;a href=\"gym\"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt;, are also situated here. Boglestone shops provide a shopping centre for Boglestone, the only area of upper Port Glasgow to have close access to such a wide variety of retailers."
