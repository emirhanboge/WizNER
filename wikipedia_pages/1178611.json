    "text": "Mount Hua () is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; located near the city of &lt;a href=\"Huayin\"&gt;Huayin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shaanxi\"&gt;Shaanxi Province&lt;/a&gt;, about east of &lt;a href=\"Xi%27an\"&gt;Xi'an&lt;/a&gt;. It is the \"Western Mountain\" of the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Mountains%20of%20China\"&gt;Five Great Mountains of China&lt;/a&gt; and has a long history of religious significance. Originally classified as having three peaks, in modern times the mountain is classified as five main peaks, the highest of which is the South Peak at .\nGeography.\nMount Hua is situated in Huayin City, which is 120 kilometres (about 75 miles) from &lt;a href=\"Xi%27an\"&gt;Xi'an&lt;/a&gt;. It is located near the southeast corner of the &lt;a href=\"Ordos%20Loop\"&gt;Ordos Loop&lt;/a&gt; section of the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20River\"&gt;Yellow River&lt;/a&gt; basin, south of the &lt;a href=\"Wei%20River\"&gt;Wei River&lt;/a&gt; valley, at the eastern end of the &lt;a href=\"Qin%20Mountains\"&gt;Qin Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, in Southern &lt;a href=\"Shanxi\"&gt;Shaanxi Province&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of the Qinling or &lt;a href=\"Qin%20Mountains\"&gt;Qin Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, which divide not only northern and southern Shaanxi, but also China.\nSummits.\nTraditionally, only the giant plateau with its summits to the south of the peak Wuyun Feng (, Five Cloud Summit) was called Taihua Shan (, Great Flower Mountain). It could only be accessed through the ridge known as Canglong Ling (, Dark Dragon Ridge) until a second trail was built in the 1980s to go around Canglong Ling. Three peaks were identified with respective summits: the East, South and West peaks. \nThe East peak consists of four summits. The highest summit is Zhaoyang Feng (, Facing Yang Summit, i.e. the summit facing the sun). Its elevation is reported to be and its name is often used as the name for the whole East Peak. To the east of Zhaoyang Feng is Shilou Feng (, Stone Tower Summit), to the south is Botai Feng (, Broad Terrace Summit) and to the west is Yun\u0171 Feng (}, Jade Maiden Summit). Today, Yun\u0171 Feng considered its own peak, most central on the mountain.\nThe South peak consists of three summits. The highest summit is Luoyan Feng (, Landing Goose Summit), with an elevation of . To the east is Songgui Feng (, Pines and Junipers Summit) and to the west is Xiaozi Feng (, Filial Son Summit).\nThe West peak has only one summit and it is known as Lianhua Feng () or Furong Feng (), both meaning Lotus Flower Summit. The elevation is .\nWith the development of new trail to Hua Shan in the 3rd through 5th century along the Hua Shan Gorge,its the longest river in the world. The peak immediately to the north of Canglong Ling, Yuntai Feng (, Cloud Terrace Peak), was identified as the North peak. It is the lowest of the five peaks with an elevation of .\nHistory.\nAs early as the 2nd century BC, there was a Daoist temple known as the Shrine of the Western Peak located at its base. &lt;a href=\"Daoism\"&gt;Daoists&lt;/a&gt; believed that in the mountain lives the god of the underworld. The temple at the foot of the mountain was often used for spirit mediums to contact the god and his underlings. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Tai\"&gt;Taishan&lt;/a&gt;, which became a popular place of pilgrimage, Huashan, because of the inaccessibility of its summits, only received Imperial and local pilgrims, and was not well visited by pilgrims from the rest of China. Huashan was also an important place for immortality seekers, as many herbal Chinese medicines are grown and powerful drugs were reputed to be found there. &lt;a href=\"Kou%20Qianzhi\"&gt;Kou Qianzhi&lt;/a&gt; (365\u2013448), the founder of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Northern%20Celestial%20Masters\"&gt;Northern Celestial Masters&lt;/a&gt; received revelations there, as did &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Tuan\"&gt;Chen Tuan&lt;/a&gt; (920\u2013989), who spent the last part of his life in hermitage on the west peak. In the 1230s, all the temples on the mountain came under control of the Daoist &lt;a href=\"Quanzhen%20School\"&gt;Quanzhen School&lt;/a&gt;. In 1998, the management committee of Huashan agreed to turn over most of the mountain's temples to the China Daoist Association. This was done to help protect the environment, as the presence of taoists and nuns deters poachers and loggers.\nTemples.\nHuashan has a variety of temples and other religious structures on its slopes and peaks. At the foot of the mountains is the Cloister of the Jade Spring (), which is dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Tuan\"&gt;Chen Tuan&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, atop the southernmost peak, there is an ancient Taoist temple which in modern times has been converted into a tea house.\nAscent routes.\nThere are three routes leading to Huashan's North Peak (), the lowest of the mountain's five major peaks. The most popular is the traditional route in Hua Shan Yu (Hua Shan Gorge), first developed in the 3rd to 4th century A.D. and with successive expansion, mostly during the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Dynasty\"&gt;Tang Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. It winds for 6\u00a0km from Huashan village to the north peak. A new route in Huang Pu Yu (Huang Pu Gorge, named after the hermit Huang Lu Zi who lived in this gorge in 8th century BC) follows the cable car to the North Peak, and is actually the ancient trail used prior to the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Dynasty\"&gt;Tang Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, which has since fallen into disrepair. It had only been known to local villagers living nearby at the gorges since 1949, when a group of seven &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Liberation%20Army\"&gt;People's Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; soldiers with a local guide used this route to climb to the North Peak and captured over 100 &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; soldiers stationed on the North Peak and along the path of the traditional route. This trail is now known as \"The Intelligent Take-over Route of Hua Shan\", and was reinforced in early 2000. The Cable Car System stations are built next to the beginning and ends of this trail. A second cable car line, to the West Peak, was opened in 2013.\nFrom the North Peak, a series of paths rise up to the Canglong Ling, which is a climb more than on top of a mountain ridge. This was the only trail to go to the four other peaks\u2014the West Peak (), the Center Peak (), the East Peak () and the South Peak (2154.9m),\u2014until a new path was built to the east around the ridge in 1998.\nHuashan has historically been a place of retreat for hardy hermits, whether Daoist, Buddhist or other; access to the mountain was only deliberately available to the strong-willed, or those who had found \"the way\". With greater mobility and prosperity, Chinese, particularly students, began to test their mettle and visit in the 1980s.\nHiking danger.\nThe route up the mountain has been called one of the most dangerous hikes in the world.\nAs tourism has boomed and the mountain's accessibility vastly improved with the installation of the cable car in the 1990s, visitor numbers have surged. The many exposed, narrow pathways with precipitous drops gave the mountain a deserved reputation for danger, although safety measures \u2014 such as cutting deeper pathways, building up stone steps and wider paths, and adding railings \u2014 have to some extent mitigated the danger. The local government has opened new tracks and created one-way routes on some of the more dangerous parts so that, barring crowds and icy conditions, the mountain can be scaled without extreme risk now. Some of the most precipitous tracks have been closed off. The former trail leading along a cliff face from the North Peak to the South Peak was known as being extremely dangerous; there is now a new and safer stone-built path to the South Peak temple and on to the Peak itself.\nMany Chinese still climb at nighttime, in order to reach the East Peak by dawn\u2014though the mountain now has many hotels. This practice is a holdover from when it was considered safer to simply be unable to see the extreme danger of the tracks during the ascent, as well as to avoid meeting descending visitors at points where pathways have scarcely enough room for one visitor to pass through safely."
