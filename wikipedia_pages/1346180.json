    "text": "A lavalava, also known as an ie, short for 'ie lavalava, is an article of daily clothing traditionally worn by &lt;a href=\"Polynesia\"&gt;Polynesia&lt;/a&gt;ns and other &lt;a href=\"Oceania\"&gt;Oceanic&lt;/a&gt; peoples. It consists of a single rectangular cloth worn similarly to a wraparound &lt;a href=\"skirt\"&gt;skirt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"kilt\"&gt;kilt&lt;/a&gt;. The term \"lavalava\" is both singular and plural in the &lt;a href=\"Samoan%20language\"&gt;Samoan language&lt;/a&gt;.\nCustomary use.\nToday the fashion remains common in &lt;a href=\"Samoa\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20Samoa\"&gt;American Samoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tonga\"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt; and parts of &lt;a href=\"Melanesia\"&gt;Melanesia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Micronesia\"&gt;Micronesia&lt;/a&gt;. It is worn by men and women in uses from school uniforms to business attire with a suit jacket and tie. Many people of Oceanic ethnicity wear the \"lavalava\" as an expression of cultural identity and for comfort within expatriate communities, especially in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; (notably &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Utah\"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttire.\nThe \"lavalava\" is secured around the waist by an overhand knotting of the upper corners of the cloth; women often tuck the loose ends into the waistband, while men usually allow them to hang in front. Women generally wear ankle-length \"lavalava\" while men's wraps often extend to the knee or mid-calf depending on the activity or occasion.\nHistory.\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans in the Pacific Ocean, the most prestigious \"lavalava\" were made by wrapping the body in a \"&lt;a href=\"%27ie%20toga\"&gt;'ie toga&lt;/a&gt;\" with fine mats (finely woven textiles of &lt;a href=\"pandanus\"&gt;pandanus&lt;/a&gt; leaves) or \"siapo\" (&lt;a href=\"tapa%20cloth\"&gt;tapa cloth&lt;/a&gt;) pounded from &lt;a href=\"paper%20mulberry\"&gt;paper mulberry&lt;/a&gt; or wild &lt;a href=\"hibiscus\"&gt;hibiscus&lt;/a&gt; bark. The Samoans also created \"lavalava\" from traditional materials such as flower petals, leaves, feathers and seashells tied to a wrap-around backing of plaited plant fibers.\n&lt;a href=\"Calico%20%28textile%29\"&gt;Calico&lt;/a&gt; and loomed &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; cloth had largely replaced woven or barkcloth \"lavalava\" as articles of daily use (though \"ie toga\" and \"siapo\" wraps are still used today for ceremonial and festive occasions and dance performances). Samoan men who bear the \"&lt;a href=\"pe%27a\"&gt;pe'a&lt;/a&gt;\" body tattoo, as well as Samoan women who bear the \"&lt;a href=\"malu\"&gt;malu&lt;/a&gt;\" leg tattoos often roll the waistband of the \"lavalava\" or tuck in the sides and rear portion(s) of the \"lavalava\" to expose their tattoo during dance performances or ceremonial functions (such as 'ava ceremonies), a style referred to as \"agini\".\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Micronesia\"&gt;Micronesia&lt;/a&gt;, the introduced term \u201clavalava\u201d is used to describe loom-woven skirts in the Outer Islands of &lt;a href=\"Yap\"&gt;Yap&lt;/a&gt;, though weaving and wearing of these textiles once extended further east into present-day &lt;a href=\"Chuuk%20State\"&gt;Chuuk&lt;/a&gt; State. Worn around a woman's hips, the fringed ends \"meet together at the front and are then wrapped to one side and secured by a belt.\" Among these Western Caroline Islanders, traditional loom weaving has been described as \u201chighly developed\u201d and weavers have long demonstrated \u201csingular ingenuity and resourcefulness\u201d in their work. The skirts\u2019 cultural significance \u201cfar exceeds their function simply as items of daily wear.\u201d The lava-lava is nothing less than a \u201chighly condensed visual expression of social and economic relations, ritual affairs, and the aesthetic ideals of Micronesian society.\u201d In addition to being worn daily by all females who have reached womanhood in the atolls of the Western Caroline Island, the skirts are also used for investiture, initiation and the burial of local leaders. While back-strap tension weaving of skirts remains a common practice in the Outer Islands of Yap in Micronesia, among migrants the practice is diminishing.\nCurrent forms.\nSpecially tailored linen \"lavalava\" which extend mid-calf, often with pockets and ties / buckles, are worn by men at special occasions or to church; these are always solid colors (in contrast to the bright patterns of everyday \"lava-lava\") and are known as \"sulu\" (&lt;a href=\"Fijian%20language\"&gt;Fijian&lt;/a&gt;), \"ie faitaga\" (Samoan), or \"&lt;a href=\"tupenu\"&gt;tupenu&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Tongan%20language\"&gt;Tongan&lt;/a&gt;). Similar ankle-length skirts form the lower half of the two-piece formal dress worn by Samoan and Tongan women (called \"&lt;a href=\"puletasi\"&gt;puletasi&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"puletaha\", respectively). On special occasions the Tongan \"tupenu\" and \"puletaha\" are usually associated with a tapa cloth or waist-mat called \"&lt;a href=\"ta%27ovala\"&gt;ta'ovala&lt;/a&gt;\" and some Samoans still wear a tapa cloth \"vala\" sash in similar fashion (though the \"vala\" is generally restricted to ceremonial / festive regalia of orators or people acting / dressing as \"taupou\" maidens and \"manaia\" beaus). The formal, tailored linen \"lavalava\" styles of Tonga, Samoa, and Fiji originated with the Fijian noble Ratu Sir &lt;a href=\"Lala%20Sukuna\"&gt;Lala Sukuna&lt;/a&gt; who introduced the buckled \"sulu\" to Fiji in 1920 following his military service and university education in Europe.\nLoudly colored \"lavalava\" made from materials such as &lt;a href=\"satin\"&gt;satin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"velvet\"&gt;velvet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"polyester\"&gt;polyester&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sequins\"&gt;sequins&lt;/a&gt; have recently been popularized among performance dance groups and village, church, or school-based choirs.\nRelated names and garments.\nIn English, such garments are generically called &lt;a href=\"sarong\"&gt;sarong&lt;/a&gt;, but that word is actually &lt;a href=\"Malay%20language\"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt;, whereas \"lavalava\" is Samoan, being short for \"\u02bbie lavalava\" (cloth that wraps around). Another common name for the Polynesian variety is \"p\u0101reu\" (usually spelled \"&lt;a href=\"pareo\"&gt;pareo&lt;/a&gt;\"), which is the &lt;a href=\"Tahitian%20language\"&gt;Tahitian&lt;/a&gt; name. In &lt;a href=\"New%20Caledonia\"&gt;New Caledonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wallis%20and%20Futuna\"&gt;Wallis and Futuna&lt;/a&gt;, lavalava are called \"manou\". A similar simple kind of clothing is the \"&lt;a href=\"lap-lap\"&gt;lap-lap&lt;/a&gt;\" worn in &lt;a href=\"Papua%20New%20Guinea\"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Oceania\"&gt;South Pacific&lt;/a&gt;, which is completely open at both sides."
