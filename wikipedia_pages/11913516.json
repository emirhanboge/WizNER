    "text": "Urta Rozenstruik (born 20 May 1975 in &lt;a href=\"Paramaribo\"&gt;Paramaribo&lt;/a&gt;) is a Dutch &lt;a href=\"sprint%20%28running%29\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt;er and &lt;a href=\"bobsleigh\"&gt;bobsledder&lt;/a&gt; born in &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;. Rozenstruik started with international bobsleigh competitions in 2002. She is a runner in a 2-bob mostly alongside &lt;a href=\"Eline%20Jurg\"&gt;Eline Jurg&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2005 two Dutch female bobs qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;2006 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Torino\"&gt;Turin&lt;/a&gt;, however the team line-ups were still unsure. At the qualification play-off (named bob-off) held in &lt;a href=\"Oberhof%2C%20Germany\"&gt;Oberhof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; four competitors fought for two seats behind Jurg and the other driver &lt;a href=\"Ilse%20Broeders\"&gt;Ilse Broeders&lt;/a&gt;. Jurg's main runner &lt;a href=\"Christel%20Bertens\"&gt;Christel Bertens&lt;/a&gt; was the main victim of the qualification process and ended up in fourth position. &lt;a href=\"Jeannette%20Pennings\"&gt;Jeannette Pennings&lt;/a&gt; was teamed-up with her main driver Broeders, while Bertens was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Kitty%20van%20Haperen\"&gt;Kitty van Haperen&lt;/a&gt; instead, Broeders' first back-up runner.\nRozenstruik, Jurg's back-up runner at the time became third and was the reserve runner in case anything would happen with either Pennings or Van Haperen. At the Olympics she saw Broeders/Pennings starting off first, crashing and causing concentration trouble for Jurg/Van Haperen who saw it all happen. This resulted in disappointing results and an eleventh position overall after four runs."
