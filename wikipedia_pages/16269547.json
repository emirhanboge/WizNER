The &lt;a href=\"academic%20journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; publishes articles, essays, notes, and commentary that cover a wide range of topics in international and &lt;a href=\"comparative%20law\"&gt;comparative law&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n\"The Yale Journal of International Law\" is the oldest of Yale Law School's eight secondary journals still in publication. The journal was founded in 1974 by a group of students who were followers of the &lt;a href=\"Approaches%20to%20International%20Law%23New%20Haven%20Approach\"&gt;New Haven School&lt;/a&gt; of international law, and their publication was originally known as \"Yale Studies in World Public Order\". Under the leadership of then &lt;a href=\"editor%20in%20chief\"&gt;editor in chief&lt;/a&gt; Eisuke Suzuki, a graduate fellow from &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, the first issue was produced without assistance from the Law School. After being renamed \"The Yale Journal of World Public Order\", the journal obtained its current title. About ten years after its founding, the Yale Law School started to support the journal.\nContent.\nSome of the journal's most-cited articles include:\nRankings.\nThe journal was ranked second among international law reviews in the 2007 \"&lt;a href=\"ExpressO%20Guide%20to%20Top%20Law%20Reviews\"&gt;ExpressO Guide to Top Law Reviews&lt;/a&gt;\" based on the number of manuscripts received.\nEvents.\nIn collaboration with \"&lt;a href=\"Opinio%20Juris\"&gt;Opinio Juris&lt;/a&gt;,\" occasional online symposia centering on scholarly conversations on articles published in the journal are organized. In collaboration with the &lt;a href=\"Forum%20on%20the%20Practice%20of%20International%20Law\"&gt;Forum on the Practice of International Law&lt;/a&gt;, the journal periodically convenes panels, workshops, and talks on diverse topics with guests including &lt;a href=\"Yale%20University\"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt; faculty, practicing international lawyers, distinguished alumni, and other campus visitors. In addition, the journal organizes a \"works in progress\" series at which Yale &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Doctor\"&gt;J.D.&lt;/a&gt; and graduate law students present papers to their colleagues with a faculty respondent who provides feedback and constructive criticism.
