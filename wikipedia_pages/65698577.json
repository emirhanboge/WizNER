    "text": "The 2021 World Series was the championship series of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;'s (MLB) &lt;a href=\"2021%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season\"&gt;2021 season&lt;/a&gt;. The 117th edition of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;, it was a &lt;a href=\"best-of-seven%20playoff\"&gt;best-of-seven playoff&lt;/a&gt; played between the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; (NL) champion &lt;a href=\"2021%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; (AL) champion &lt;a href=\"2021%20Houston%20Astros%20season\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;. The series began on October 26 and concluded on November 2. The Braves won the series four games to two. It was their fourth World Series title in franchise history, their first since &lt;a href=\"1995%20World%20Series\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;, and their second in Atlanta.\nThe Braves reached the World Series after winning the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20East\"&gt;NL East&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Brewers\"&gt;Milwaukee Brewers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20National%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;NL Division Series&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;NL Championship Series&lt;/a&gt;. The Astros won the &lt;a href=\"American%20League%20West\"&gt;AL West&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;AL Division Series&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;AL Championship Series&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Astros had &lt;a href=\"home-field%20advantage\"&gt;home-field advantage&lt;/a&gt; due to their better regular-season record than that of the Braves. The teams split the first two games, which were played at &lt;a href=\"Minute%20Maid%20Park\"&gt;Minute Maid Park&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, and the Braves won Games 3 and 4 at &lt;a href=\"Truist%20Park\"&gt;Truist Park&lt;/a&gt; in Atlanta. The Astros won Game 5, returning the series to Houston. The Braves won Game 6 to win the World Series. &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Soler\"&gt;Jorge Soler&lt;/a&gt; was awarded the &lt;a href=\"World%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;World Series Most Valuable Player Award&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"batting%20average\"&gt;batting&lt;/a&gt; .300 in the series with &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s in three of the Braves' victories, each time giving them a lead they would never surrender.\nBackground.\nThe team with the better regular-season &lt;a href=\"winning%20percentage\"&gt;winning percentage&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Houston%20Astros%20season\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;, had &lt;a href=\"home%20field%20advantage\"&gt;home field advantage&lt;/a&gt; in the series, thus hosting Games 1, 2, and 6 (and would have hosted Game 7 if needed).\nThe Astros and Braves had previously met in the postseason five times, in the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;National League Division Series&lt;/a&gt; when the Astros competed in the National League. Of those five series, the Braves won three (1997, 1999, and 2001) while the Astros won two (2004 and 2005).\nThe teams' jerseys lacked a World Series &lt;a href=\"embroidered%20patch\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 1997, though a patch was on their &lt;a href=\"baseball%20cap\"&gt;caps&lt;/a&gt;.\nAtlanta Braves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt; were managed by &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Snitker\"&gt;Brian Snitker&lt;/a&gt;, who joined the organization in 1977 and became their manager in 2016. The Braves qualified for the postseason after winning the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20East\"&gt;National League East&lt;/a&gt; for the fourth straight season. They played four months with a winning percentage at .500 or below before finally surpassing .500 on August 6, the latest point in a season that an eventual league champion achieved a winning record. In the best-of-five &lt;a href=\"2021%20National%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;National League Division Series&lt;/a&gt;, they defeated the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Milwaukee%20Brewers%20season\"&gt;Milwaukee Brewers&lt;/a&gt; in four games. In the best-of-seven &lt;a href=\"2021%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;National League Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; (NLCS), the Braves defeated the defending world champion &lt;a href=\"2021%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; in six games. &lt;a href=\"Left%20fielder\"&gt;Left fielder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Rosario\"&gt;Eddie Rosario&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"League%20Championship%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;NLCS MVP&lt;/a&gt;. \nThis was the Braves' first World Series appearance since &lt;a href=\"1999%20World%20Series\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, tenth in franchise history, and sixth while in Atlanta. The Braves entered the series with three prior World Series titles, one as the Atlanta Braves in and one while based in each of their previous cities of Boston () and Milwaukee ().\nHouston Astros.\nUnder second-year manager &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Baker\"&gt;Dusty Baker&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt; qualified for the postseason as the &lt;a href=\"American%20League%20West\"&gt;American League West&lt;/a&gt; division winner, having finished atop the division for the fourth time in five seasons. In the best-of-five &lt;a href=\"2021%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;American League Division Series&lt;/a&gt;, they defeated the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; in four games. In the best-of-seven &lt;a href=\"2021%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;American League Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; (ALCS), the Astros defeated the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; in six games, with &lt;a href=\"designated%20hitter\"&gt;designated hitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yordan%20%C3%81lvarez\"&gt;Yordan \u00c1lvarez&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"League%20Championship%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;ALCS MVP&lt;/a&gt; after batting 12-for-23 (.522) in the series. Starting pitcher &lt;a href=\"Lance%20McCullers%20Jr.\"&gt;Lance McCullers Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, who missed the ALCS due to a forearm strain suffered during the ALDS, was omitted from Houston's World Series roster due to that injury.\nBaker became the ninth manager to win both American and National League pennants (having won the latter with the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt; in 2002). Baker's gap of 19 years between appearances in the World Series is surpassed only by &lt;a href=\"Bucky%20Harris\"&gt;Bucky Harris&lt;/a&gt;, who managed in the and editions. At 72 years and 4 months old, Baker became the second-oldest manager in World Series history, the oldest having been &lt;a href=\"Jack%20McKeon\"&gt;Jack McKeon&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Marlins\"&gt;Florida Marlins&lt;/a&gt; in , who was seven months older. Astros' &lt;a href=\"hitting%20coach\"&gt;hitting coach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Troy%20Snitker\"&gt;Troy Snitker&lt;/a&gt; is the son of &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Snitker\"&gt;Brian Snitker&lt;/a&gt;, the Braves' manager.\nThis was the Astros' third World Series appearance in five years, having appeared in and , and fourth overall, having also appeared in when they represented the National League. Their only prior World Series title came in 2017.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nIn pregame ceremonies, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner\"&gt;national anthem&lt;/a&gt; was performed by &lt;a href=\"Keke%20Palmer\"&gt;Keke Palmer&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"ceremonial%20first%20pitch\"&gt;ceremonial first pitch&lt;/a&gt; was thrown out by former Astro and &lt;a href=\"National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;National Baseball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; inductee &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Biggio\"&gt;Craig Biggio&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Framber%20Valdez\"&gt;Framber Valdez&lt;/a&gt; started for Houston while former Astro &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Morton%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Charlie Morton&lt;/a&gt; started for Atlanta. &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Soler\"&gt;Jorge Soler&lt;/a&gt; led off the World Series with a &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt; to left for a 1\u20130 Atlanta lead after the first three pitches; he became the first player ever to lead off a &lt;a href=\"World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; with a home run. A one-out single by &lt;a href=\"Ozzie%20Albies\"&gt;Ozzie Albies&lt;/a&gt; followed by a &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Riley\"&gt;Austin Riley&lt;/a&gt; gave the Braves a 2\u20130 lead. In the bottom of the first, the Astros had the &lt;a href=\"bases%20loaded\"&gt;bases loaded&lt;/a&gt; with two outs following a single and two walks, but Morton got &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Tucker\"&gt;Kyle Tucker&lt;/a&gt; to ground out, ending the threat. Atlanta added a run in the top of the second on two singles, a flyout, and a &lt;a href=\"fielder%27s%20choice\"&gt;fielder's choice&lt;/a&gt;, making it 3\u20130. &lt;a href=\"Freddie%20Freeman\"&gt;Freddie Freeman&lt;/a&gt; then singled and Albies beat out an infield grounder, loading the bases with two outs, but Valdez struck out Riley to end the inning. In the top of the third, &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Rosario\"&gt;Eddie Rosario&lt;/a&gt; singled, followed by a two-run home run from &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Duvall\"&gt;Adam Duvall&lt;/a&gt;, making it 5\u20130 Braves and driving Valdez from the game after 52 pitches. \nMorton left in the bottom of the third inning with an injury; X-rays later revealed a &lt;a href=\"fibular%20fracture\"&gt;fibular fracture&lt;/a&gt; in his right leg, causing him to miss the remainder of the series. The injury stemmed from a &lt;a href=\"comebacker\"&gt;comebacker&lt;/a&gt; off the bat of &lt;a href=\"Yuli%20Gurriel\"&gt;Yuli Gurriel&lt;/a&gt; in the bottom of the second. It was unclear when Morton's leg was fractured; Braves manager Brian Snitker told reporters that X-rays taken in between innings revealed nothing wrong with Morton, though he said Morton's leg was \"stressed.\" Morton threw 16 pitches following the injury, retiring the next three batters he faced and striking out two.\n&lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Minter\"&gt;A. J. Minter&lt;/a&gt; was brought into the game; &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Brantley\"&gt;Michael Brantley&lt;/a&gt; hit a one-out double to right, but Minter retired the next two batters to end the inning. In the bottom of the fourth inning, Tucker hit a one-out double, advanced to third when Gurriel singled with one out, and scored on a fielder's choice, making it 5\u20131. In the top of the eighth, after three scoreless innings, &lt;a href=\"Dansby%20Swanson\"&gt;Dansby Swanson&lt;/a&gt; walked, advanced to third on a single by Soler, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Freeman, extending Atlanta's lead to 6\u20131. In the bottom of the inning, &lt;a href=\"Yordan%20%C3%81lvarez\"&gt;Yordan \u00c1lvarez&lt;/a&gt; hit a lead-off triple then scored on a groundout by &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Correa\"&gt;Carlos Correa&lt;/a&gt;, making the score 6\u20132. In the bottom of the ninth, Atlanta &lt;a href=\"closer%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;closer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Will%20Smith%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Will Smith&lt;/a&gt; allowed only one walk, to &lt;a href=\"Aledmys%20D%C3%ADaz\"&gt;Aledmys D\u00edaz&lt;/a&gt;, as the Braves took a 1\u20130 lead in the series.\nGame 2.\nPrior to the game, Atlanta added &lt;a href=\"Tucker%20Davidson\"&gt;Tucker Davidson&lt;/a&gt; to their roster in replacement of the injured &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Morton%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Charlie Morton&lt;/a&gt;. Giavanni Walker, a &lt;a href=\"petty%20officer%20first%20class\"&gt;petty officer first class&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;, sang the national anthem and Hall of Famer &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Bagwell\"&gt;Jeff Bagwell&lt;/a&gt; threw the ceremonial first pitch.\n&lt;a href=\"Max%20Fried\"&gt;Max Fried&lt;/a&gt; started for Atlanta while &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Urquidy\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Urquidy&lt;/a&gt; started for Houston. In the bottom of the first inning, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Altuve\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Altuve&lt;/a&gt; doubled, advanced to third on a flyout by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Brantley\"&gt;Michael Brantley&lt;/a&gt;, and scored on a &lt;a href=\"sacrifice%20fly\"&gt;sacrifice fly&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Bregman\"&gt;Alex Bregman&lt;/a&gt;, giving Houston a 1\u20130 lead. In the top of the second, Atlanta tied the game, 1\u20131, via a solo home run to left field by &lt;a href=\"Travis%20d%27Arnaud\"&gt;Travis d'Arnaud&lt;/a&gt;, coming on a full count with two outs. In the bottom of the second, the Astros hit three consecutive one-out singles, retaking the lead, 2\u20131. With runners on first and second, &lt;a href=\"Mart%C3%ADn%20Maldonado\"&gt;Mart\u00edn Maldonado&lt;/a&gt; delivered a base hit to the outfield, driving in another run. Braves left fielder &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Rosario\"&gt;Eddie Rosario&lt;/a&gt; tried to throw out &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Siri\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Siri&lt;/a&gt; advancing from first to third, but no Braves player was on the base resulting in an &lt;a href=\"error%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;error&lt;/a&gt;, and allowing Siri to score and making it 4\u20131. After Altuve lined out, Brantley singled to make it 5\u20131. In total, the Astros collected four runs on five singles, tying their club record for most hits in an inning in the World Series.\nWith two outs in the top of the fifth inning, &lt;a href=\"Freddie%20Freeman\"&gt;Freddie Freeman&lt;/a&gt; delivered an RBI single to left, scoring d'Arnaud and cutting the Astros' lead to 5\u20132. Houston extended their lead to 6\u20132 in the sixth on a &lt;a href=\"fielder%27s%20choice\"&gt;fielder's choice&lt;/a&gt; that scored &lt;a href=\"Yordan%20%C3%81lvarez\"&gt;Yordan \u00c1lvarez&lt;/a&gt;. The final run came in the bottom of the seventh inning, as Altuve homered on the first pitch by &lt;a href=\"Drew%20Smyly\"&gt;Drew Smyly&lt;/a&gt;, making it 7\u20132. It was the 22nd home run of Altuve's postseason career, tying him with &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Williams\"&gt;Bernie Williams&lt;/a&gt; for the second-most all-time. This was the first victory by the home team in a World Series since &lt;a href=\"2018%20World%20Series\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;.\nGame 3.\nIn pregame ceremonies, the &lt;a href=\"ceremonial%20first%20pitch\"&gt;ceremonial first pitch&lt;/a&gt; was thrown out by Hank Aaron Jr., as &lt;a href=\"Hank%20Aaron\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; was honored before the game; the national anthem was performed by &lt;a href=\"Zac%20Brown\"&gt;Zac Brown&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first World Series game ever played at &lt;a href=\"Truist%20Park\"&gt;Truist Park&lt;/a&gt;, and the first played in Atlanta since . &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Anderson%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Ian Anderson&lt;/a&gt; started for Atlanta while &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Garc%C3%ADa%20%28pitcher%2C%20born%201996%29\"&gt;Luis Garc\u00eda&lt;/a&gt; started for Houston, marking the first time two rookie pitchers started against each other in a World Series since &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Verlander\"&gt;Justin Verlander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Reyes\"&gt;Anthony Reyes&lt;/a&gt; opened Game 1 in .\nAfter two and a half scoreless innings, the Braves scored on an RBI double by &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Riley\"&gt;Austin Riley&lt;/a&gt; that drove in &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Rosario\"&gt;Eddie Rosario&lt;/a&gt; in the bottom of the third inning. Garc\u00eda was relieved after innings, having allowed one run on three hits while striking out six batters. Anderson allowed no hits, three walks, and one &lt;a href=\"hit%20by%20pitch\"&gt;hit batsman&lt;/a&gt; while striking out four in five innings. The Astros remained hitless through seven innings, as &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Minter\"&gt;A. J. Minter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Jackson%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Luke Jackson&lt;/a&gt; did not allow a hit in the sixth or seventh, respectively. &lt;a href=\"Tyler%20Matzek\"&gt;Tyler Matzek&lt;/a&gt; started the eighth for the Braves and allowed a bloop single to &lt;a href=\"Aledmys%20D%C3%ADaz\"&gt;Aledmys D\u00edaz&lt;/a&gt;, who was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Siri\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Siri&lt;/a&gt; as a pinch-runner. With two outs, Siri &lt;a href=\"stolen%20base\"&gt;stole&lt;/a&gt; second and advanced to third on a throwing &lt;a href=\"error%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;error&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Travis%20d%27Arnaud\"&gt;Travis d'Arnaud&lt;/a&gt;, but was left on base as &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Brantley\"&gt;Michael Brantley&lt;/a&gt; popped out. In the bottom of the eighth, d'Arnaud hit a solo home run to extend Atlanta's lead to 2\u20130. That home run was the first time home runs were hit in back-to-back games by the same player since &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Klesko\"&gt;Ryan Klesko&lt;/a&gt; did so in the &lt;a href=\"1995%20World%20Series\"&gt;1995 World Series&lt;/a&gt;. d'Arnaud became the first catcher to do this since &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Campanella\"&gt;Roy Campenlla&lt;/a&gt; did so for the Dodgers in the &lt;a href=\"1955%20World%20%20Series\"&gt;1955 World Series&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Will%20Smith%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Will Smith&lt;/a&gt;, Atlanta's &lt;a href=\"closer%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;closer&lt;/a&gt;, pitched the top of the ninth inning. He allowed a leadoff single to &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Bregman\"&gt;Alex Bregman&lt;/a&gt;, then retired the next three batters, giving Atlanta a 2\u20131 lead in the series. The seven-inning &lt;a href=\"no%20hitter\"&gt;no-hit&lt;/a&gt; bid by the Atlanta pitching staff was the longest in a World Series game since &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Lonborg\"&gt;Jim Lonborg&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; went innings before allowing a hit in Game 2 of the &lt;a href=\"1967%20World%20Series\"&gt;1967 World Series&lt;/a&gt;.\nGame 4.\nPrior to the game, the Astros replaced backup catcher &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Castro%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Jason Castro&lt;/a&gt; on their roster with &lt;a href=\"Garrett%20Stubbs\"&gt;Garrett Stubbs&lt;/a&gt;, due to COVID-19 protocols. The &lt;a href=\"ceremonial%20first%20pitch\"&gt;ceremonial first pitch&lt;/a&gt; was thrown out by cancer survivor Elizabeth O\u2019Connor, and the national anthem was performed by &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Fisher\"&gt;Jordan Fisher&lt;/a&gt;. Former &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;First Lady&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Melania%20Trump\"&gt;Melania Trump&lt;/a&gt; attended the game along with four cast members from the FOX drama \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Resident%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Resident&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Zack%20Greinke\"&gt;Zack Greinke&lt;/a&gt; started for Houston, while &lt;a href=\"Dylan%20Lee\"&gt;Dylan Lee&lt;/a&gt; acted as an &lt;a href=\"opener%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;opener&lt;/a&gt; for Atlanta in his first MLB start. Greinke was placed eighth in Houston's &lt;a href=\"Batting%20order%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting order&lt;/a&gt;, the first starting pitcher in a World Series game not to bat ninth since &lt;a href=\"Babe%20Ruth\"&gt;Babe Ruth&lt;/a&gt; in Game 4 of the &lt;a href=\"1918%20World%20Series\"&gt;1918 World Series&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the top of the first, Lee allowed a hit to &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Altuve\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Altuve&lt;/a&gt; while issuing two walks and recording one strikeout, then was relieved by &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Wright%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Kyle Wright&lt;/a&gt;. Altuve scored on a ground out by &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Correa\"&gt;Carlos Correa&lt;/a&gt; to give the Astros an early 1\u20130 lead. Altuve hit a solo home run in the top of the fourth to extend Houston's lead to 2\u20130. Greinke exited after four innings, having allowed no runs on four hits while striking out three and walking none. In the bottom of the sixth, Atlanta had runners at first and second with one out, via a double and a walk. Houston reliever &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Maton\"&gt;Phil Maton&lt;/a&gt; entered, struck out &lt;a href=\"Ozzie%20Albies\"&gt;Ozzie Albies&lt;/a&gt;, and allowed a hit to &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Riley\"&gt;Austin Riley&lt;/a&gt; that scored a run, cutting the lead to 2\u20131. After an &lt;a href=\"Intentional%20base%20on%20balls\"&gt;intentional walk&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Joc%20Pederson\"&gt;Joc Pederson&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"bases%20loaded\"&gt;loaded the bases&lt;/a&gt; with two outs, Maton struck out &lt;a href=\"Travis%20d%27Arnaud\"&gt;Travis d'Arnaud&lt;/a&gt; to end the rally.
