    "text": "Warrenville is a city in &lt;a href=\"DuPage%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;DuPage County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. As of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt;, the city had a total population of 13,140, which was estimated to have increased to 13,174 by July 2019. It is a part of the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Chicago metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illinois%20Technology%20and%20Research%20Corridor\"&gt;Illinois Technology and Research Corridor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWarrenville was founded in 1833 when Julius Warren and his family moved west from &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; seeking a fresh start from a failing &lt;a href=\"gristmill\"&gt;gristmill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"distillation\"&gt;distillery&lt;/a&gt;. Daniel Warren, Julius' father, claimed land at what is now McDowell Woods, and Julius claimed land at what is now the Warrenville Grove Forest Preserve. The first major establishment, an inn and tavern, was built in 1838 by Julius Warren himself, as the family was skilled in timber and grain. The inn still stands today, and was renovated in 2002.\nThe town quickly blossomed with two mills and a &lt;a href=\"plank%20road\"&gt;plank road&lt;/a&gt; connecting it with &lt;a href=\"Naperville%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Naperville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winfield%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Winfield&lt;/a&gt;, on which Julius operated a &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; line. The town failed at its bid to have the &lt;a href=\"railroad\"&gt;railroad&lt;/a&gt; come through the town. However, in 1902, the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Aurora%20and%20Elgin%20Railroad\"&gt;Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad&lt;/a&gt; came through town, which lasted until the late 1950s.\nWith a population of 4,000, Warrenville was finally &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20corporation\"&gt;incorporated&lt;/a&gt; as a city in 1967, following six unsuccessful attempts. The 1970s and 1980s brought westward expansion from the city of Chicago, causing the small farming community's population to nearly double to 7,800.\nGeography.\nWarrenville is located at (41.826280, -88.189465).\nAccording to the 2010 census, Warrenville has a total area of , of which (or 97.19%) is land and (or 2.81%) is water.\nDemographics.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2000, there were 13,363 people, 4,931 households, and 3,476 families residing in the city.
