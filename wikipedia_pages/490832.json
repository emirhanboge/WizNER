    "text": " and are 1999 &lt;a href=\"role-playing%20video%20game\"&gt;role-playing video game&lt;/a&gt;s developed by &lt;a href=\"Game%20Freak\"&gt;Game Freak&lt;/a&gt; and published by &lt;a href=\"Nintendo\"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt;. They are the first installments in the second generation of the &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28video%20game%20series%29\"&gt;\"Pok\u00e9mon\" video game series&lt;/a&gt;. They were released in Japan in 1999, Australia and North America in 2000, and Europe in 2001. \"&lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Crystal\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Crystal&lt;/a&gt;\", an enhanced version, was released a year later in each region. In 2009, on the 10th anniversary of \"Gold\" and \"Silver\", &lt;a href=\"video%20game%20remake\"&gt;remakes&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20HeartGold%20and%20SoulSilver\"&gt;\"Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\"&lt;/a&gt; were released for the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe games introduce &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20generation%20II%20Pok%C3%A9mon\"&gt;100 new species of Pok\u00e9mon&lt;/a&gt; and follow the progress of the player character in their quest to master &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20game%20mechanics%23Pok%C3%A9mon%20battles\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon battling&lt;/a&gt;. Both games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and, while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between these games and their predecessors in order to fully complete the games' &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9dex\"&gt;Pok\u00e9dex&lt;/a&gt;. The Johto Saga of the &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28anime%29\"&gt;\"Pok\u00e9mon\" anime&lt;/a&gt; is based on the new region introduced in the games.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\" were critically acclaimed upon release. They are considered by some to be the best games in the entire series, as well as some of the most significant games of the &lt;a href=\"fifth%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles\"&gt;fifth generation of video game consoles&lt;/a&gt;. They continued the enormous success of &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Red%20and%20Blue\"&gt;\"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Blue\"&lt;/a&gt; as \"Pok\u00e9mon\" began to form into a multi-billion dollar franchise. The games almost matched the sales of \"Red\" and \"Blue\", and by 2010 had gone on to sell over 23 million units making them &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20best-selling%20Game%20Boy%20video%20games\"&gt;the best-selling games&lt;/a&gt; for the Game Boy Color and the third-best-selling for the Game Boy family of systems.\nGameplay.\nLike previous installments, \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\" are played from a &lt;a href=\"Third-person%20%28video%20games%29\"&gt;third-person&lt;/a&gt;, top-down perspective, with players directly navigating the protagonist around the &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20universe\"&gt;fictional universe&lt;/a&gt;, interacting with objects and people. As the player explores this world, they will encounter different terrains, such as grassy fields, forests, caves, and seas in which different Pok\u00e9mon species reside. As the player randomly encounters one of these creatures, the field switches to a &lt;a href=\"turn-based\"&gt;turn-based&lt;/a&gt; \"battle scene\", where the Pok\u00e9mon will fight.\nThere are two main goals within the games: following through the main storyline and defeating the Elite Four and Pok\u00e9mon Master Lance to become the new Champion, and completing the &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9dex\"&gt;Pok\u00e9dex&lt;/a&gt; by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 251 creatures. A major aspect of this is developing and raising the player's Pok\u00e9mon by battling other Pok\u00e9mon, which can be found in the wild or owned by other Trainers. This system of accumulating &lt;a href=\"experience%20point\"&gt;experience point&lt;/a&gt;s (EXP) and leveling up, characteristic and integral to all &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28video%20game%20series%29\"&gt;\"Pok\u00e9mon\" video games&lt;/a&gt;, controls the physical properties of the Pok\u00e9mon, such as the &lt;a href=\"Pokemon%20statistics\"&gt;battle statistics&lt;/a&gt; acquired, and the &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20moves\"&gt;moves&lt;/a&gt; learned.\nNew features.\nWhile \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\" retain the basic mechanics of capturing, battling, and evolving introduced in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Blue\", new features were added. A time system was introduced using a real-time internal clock that keeps track of the current time and day of the week. Certain events, including Pok\u00e9mon appearances, are influenced by this feature. New items were added, with some designed to exploit a new mechanic: Pok\u00e9mon being able to &lt;a href=\"Gameplay%20of%20Pok%C3%A9mon%23Holding%20items\"&gt;hold items&lt;/a&gt;. A new type of item able to be held was the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Pokemon%20items\"&gt;berry&lt;/a&gt;, which comes in varieties and can restore health or cure status effects. Other held items can give boosts to the Pok\u00e9mon during battle. More specialized &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9%20Ball\"&gt;Pok\u00e9 Ball&lt;/a&gt;s were introduced, which make Pok\u00e9mon catching easier in certain situations. A new item called the Pok\u00e9gear was introduced, functioning as a watch, map, radio, and phone, allowing the player to call other characters who offer their phone number. Trainers will call for a rematch and others will call about rare Pok\u00e9mon that can be caught in a certain area.\nThe games introduce &lt;a href=\"Raikou%20%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29\"&gt;Raikou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entei%20%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29\"&gt;Entei&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Suicune\"&gt;Suicune&lt;/a&gt;, some new types of &lt;a href=\"legendary%20Pok%C3%A9mon\"&gt;legendary Pok\u00e9mon&lt;/a&gt; that wander around Johto, changing locations frequently. They can be tracked by the &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9dex\"&gt;Pok\u00e9dex&lt;/a&gt; once encountered, and will always attempt to flee, but will retain &lt;a href=\"Pokemon%20statistics\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; loss. In addition there is the possibility of encountering a &lt;a href=\"shiny%20Pok%C3%A9mon\"&gt;shiny Pok\u00e9mon&lt;/a&gt;, which have a different coloration than normal Pok\u00e9mon of their species, and appear very rarely. Two new &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20types\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon types&lt;/a&gt; were added, the Steel-type and the Dark-type. Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon are immune to Poison-type moves, and they have very high defense and resistance to other types, while Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon are immune to Psychic-type moves and are strong against Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon (which provides an offensive strategy, formerly absent against Psychic-types), as well as having few weaknesses. In \"Gold\" and \"Silver\", new &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20moves\"&gt;moves&lt;/a&gt; were added, but Pok\u00e9mon knowing these moves are not allowed to be traded to the first generation games. To solve this, a move deleter was introduced, capable of erasing moves known by the Pok\u00e9mon. Another major change was the splitting of the \"Special\" &lt;a href=\"Pokemon%20statistics\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt; into \"Special Attack\" and \"Special Defense\", which increased aspects of strategy.\nWith the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20breeding\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon breeding&lt;/a&gt;, Pok\u00e9mon are assigned to one or two breeding groups. When a male and female Pok\u00e9mon that share at least one breeding group are left at a Pok\u00e9mon Daycare, they may produce an egg, which will hatch into a young Pok\u00e9mon. The young Pok\u00e9mon will inherit the species of its mother, and moves from its father. However, legendary and mythical Pok\u00e9mon, among certain other species, cannot breed.\nPlot.\nSetting.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\" are set in the region of Johto, situated to the west of the Kanto region from the previous \"Red\" and \"Blue\" games, and three years after the conclusion of the previous games. The design of Johto was inspired by Japan's &lt;a href=\"Kansai%20region\"&gt;Kansai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"T%C5%8Dkai%20region\"&gt;T\u014dkai region&lt;/a&gt;s, with many of the region's temples and more traditional Japanese aesthetics finding their way into Johto. The locations in the game within Johto include New Bark Town, Cherrygrove City, Violet City (\u30ad\u30ad\u30e7\u30a6\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3 Kiky\u014d City), Azalea Town (\u30d2\u30ef\u30c0\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3 Hiwada Town), Goldenrod City (\u30b3\u30ac\u30cd\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3 Kogane City), Ecruteak City (\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30e5\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3 Enju City), Olivine City (\u30a2\u30b5\u30ae\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3 Asagi City), Cianwood City (\u30bf\u30f3\u30d0\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3 Tanba City), Mahogany Town (\u30c1\u30e7\u30a6\u30b8\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3 Ch\u014dji Town), and Blackthorn City (\u30d5\u30b9\u30d9\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3 Fusube City). Most of the cities have one gym leader each, which serves as a boss, as do some of the towns.\nStory.\nAs with the previous games, the player character receives his first Pok\u00e9mon, a choice between &lt;a href=\"Chikorita\"&gt;Chikorita&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyndaquil\"&gt;Cyndaquil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Totodile\"&gt;Totodile&lt;/a&gt;, from the region's local Pok\u00e9mon scientist, Professor Elm, and then begins his journey to win the eight Gym Badges of the Johto region and then challenge the Elite Four and Champion to become the region's new Pok\u00e9mon Master. Opposing him is his mysterious rival, a boy who stole one of the other Pok\u00e9mon from Professor Elm and regularly challenges the player to test his strengths. The player also encounters the villainous &lt;a href=\"Team%20Rocket\"&gt;Team Rocket&lt;/a&gt;, having reunited to seek out their previous leader Giovanni to return the group to their former glory. Eventually, the player thwarts Team Rocket once and for all and defeats the Elite Four and Champion of the Pok\u00e9mon League on Indigo Plateau. The player can then travel to the Kanto region from the previous games and challenge the Gym Leaders there, discovering how much has changed in the three years following the events of \"Red\" and \"Blue\". After defeating the Kanto region's Gym Leaders, the player is allowed to enter the treacherous Mt. Silver area, home to very powerful Pok\u00e9mon. Deep within Mt. Silver's caves is Red, the protagonist of \"Red\" and \"Blue\", whom the player can challenge for the most difficult battle in the game.\nDevelopment.\n\"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were first publicly showcased at November 1997, &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Space%20World\"&gt;Nintendo Space World&lt;/a&gt; Expo in Japan, becoming the most popular exhibit at the program. Unlike the previous game in the series, \"&lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Yellow\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Yellow&lt;/a&gt;\", the new titles were announced to be more than a small upgrade to &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Red%20and%20Blue\"&gt;\"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Blue\"&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, they would feature a new storyline, a new world, and new species of Pok\u00e9mon. \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were designed for the Game Boy Color, allowing them full color support and more detailed &lt;a href=\"sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29\"&gt;sprites&lt;/a&gt;. Other additions that were shown included Pok\u00e9mon breeding, &lt;a href=\"Gameplay%20of%20Pok%C3%A9mon%23Holding%20items\"&gt;held items&lt;/a&gt;, an in-game gadget known as the Pok\u00e9Gear, a real-time internal clock, and &lt;a href=\"backward%20compatibility\"&gt;backward compatibility&lt;/a&gt; with the previous games in the series.\nDuring an \"&lt;a href=\"ABC%20News\"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;\" interview, president of &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20Inc.\"&gt;Creatures Inc.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tsunekazu%20Ishihara\"&gt;Tsunekazu Ishihara&lt;/a&gt; gave insight into the brainstorming process for developing new Pok\u00e9mon species. He explained, \"The ideas for each of these monsters came from the imagination of the software developers at Game Freak who get these ideas from their childhood experiences, including from reading &lt;a href=\"manga\"&gt;manga&lt;/a&gt;, the name for Japanese comic books. Ideas come from scary experiences they had as kids, catching insects, and so forth. So from these experiences in childhood, these ideas for Pok\u00e9mon came out\". In the same vein as the Pok\u00e9mon &lt;a href=\"Mew%20%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29\"&gt;Mew&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Red%20and%20Blue\"&gt;\"Red\" and \"Blue\"&lt;/a&gt;, the exclusive Pok\u00e9mon &lt;a href=\"Celebi%20%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29\"&gt;Celebi&lt;/a&gt; was included in the \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" games but is only accessible after attending a Nintendo promotional event. The first official event offering Celebi was &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Space%20World\"&gt;Nintendo Space World&lt;/a&gt; 2000 in Japan, in which 100,000 attendees would be awarded the rare Pok\u00e9mon. In order to be selected, players had to send in a postcard to enter a lottery for one of 100,000 certificates of Celebi, allowing them to enter the event and obtain it.\nIshihara stated that \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" started development right after &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Red%20and%20Blue%23Development\"&gt;\"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Green\"&lt;/a&gt; were released in Japan. The original intention was to release the game in 1998, even synchronizing with the supposed end of the &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28anime%29\"&gt;anime&lt;/a&gt;'s . Development issues, worsened by Game Freak being sidetracked with \"&lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Stadium\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Stadium&lt;/a&gt;\" and the localization of the first generation, led the game to be postponed, and the original release slate was taken over by \"&lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Yellow\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Yellow&lt;/a&gt;\". Programmer Shigeki Morimoto stated that part of why development took three and a half years was due to being a small team of only four programmers. &lt;a href=\"Satoru%20Iwata\"&gt;Satoru Iwata&lt;/a&gt;, then the president of &lt;a href=\"HAL%20Laboratory\"&gt;HAL Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; who would later become Nintendo's CEO, helped the team by developing new tools for compressing the Pok\u00e9mon graphic code.\nAudio.\n&lt;a href=\"Junichi%20Masuda\"&gt;Junichi Masuda&lt;/a&gt; composed his music on an &lt;a href=\"Amiga\"&gt;Amiga&lt;/a&gt; computer, presumably in a &lt;a href=\"music%20tracker\"&gt;music tracker&lt;/a&gt; format, converted to MIDI data and converted again to the Game Boy Color.\nUnused Pok\u00e9mon leak.\nFour &lt;a href=\"ROM%20image\"&gt;ROM image&lt;/a&gt;s from the early-in-development Japanese-language demo were leaked during the 1997 Nintendo Space World presentation: two &lt;a href=\"debug\"&gt;debug&lt;/a&gt; versions of the games, and two versions that were modified to work on normal &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy\"&gt;Game Boy&lt;/a&gt; hardware and most emulators. These ROM images were only rumored to exist, until they were anonymously posted on the \"\"Pok\u00e9mon\" Reverse Engineering Tools\" (PRET) &lt;a href=\"Discord%20%28software%29\"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; server on May 26, 2018. The demo was quickly shared with members of the website \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cutting%20Room%20Floor%20%28website%29\"&gt;The Cutting Room Floor&lt;/a&gt;\". The ROMs were analyzed and translated, and \"The Cutting Room Floor\" went on to release a spreadsheet containing all the information they had discovered, which includes a list of Pok\u00e9mon species, Pok\u00e9mon \"moves\", &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28gaming%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"non-playable%20characters\"&gt;non-playable characters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Level%20%28video%20gaming%29\"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt;, and music. The ROMs were first released anonymously onto &lt;a href=\"4chan\"&gt;4chan&lt;/a&gt;'s /vp/ board on May 31st, with a formal \"The Cutting Room Floor\" release coming later that day. The demo has a larger world map than the final game, and includes around 100 unused and changed Pok\u00e9mon designs.\nEarlier in May 2018, \"Pok\u00e9mon\" artist &lt;a href=\"Atsuko%20Nishida\"&gt;Atsuko Nishida&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the popular creature &lt;a href=\"Pikachu\"&gt;Pikachu&lt;/a&gt; was originally supposed to have a third evolution, named \"Gorochu\". Also, \"Pokemon\" creator &lt;a href=\"Satoshi%20Tajiri\"&gt;Satoshi Tajiri&lt;/a&gt; happened to reveal four unused designs that would have been included in the original \"Pok\u00e9mon\" games.\nWhile cut content is not uncommon in video games, the volume of cut content in the \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" demo has been described as \"overwhelming\". Matthew Byrd, writing for \"&lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Geek\"&gt;Den of Geek&lt;/a&gt;\", stated that a lot of design work had gone into the Pok\u00e9mon that were eventually cut, suggesting that Game Freak might have taken them out during the testing phase due to &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28game%20design%29\"&gt;balance issues&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelease.\nIn September 1999, the games were announced for release in Japan on 21 November 1999 and a North American release date was estimated for September 2000. Nintendo announced the release of the &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Pikachu\"&gt;Pocket Pikachu Color&lt;/a&gt;, a full-color portable &lt;a href=\"digital%20pet\"&gt;digital pet&lt;/a&gt; similar to the one released the year before. The unit is compatible with \"Gold\" and \"Silver\", allowing the transfer of in-game currency known as \"watt points\". Pocket Pikachu Color was slated for release in Japan on 21 November 1999, the same day as the release of \"Gold\" and \"Silver\". In addition, an officially licensed &lt;a href=\"Pikachu\"&gt;Pikachu&lt;/a&gt;-themed &lt;a href=\"Game%20Link%20Cable\"&gt;Game Link Cable&lt;/a&gt; developed by &lt;a href=\"Kemco\"&gt;Kemco&lt;/a&gt; was set for release in Japan on 18 November 1999. The product functions like a normal Game Link Cable and consists of a yellow cable with a figure of Pikachu on one end, and a &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9%20Ball\"&gt;Pok\u00e9 Ball&lt;/a&gt; on the other.\nAnticipating high sales, Nintendo set its first production shipment for the games in Japan at three million, predicting that eventually more than eight million copies would be sold in the country alone. However, they were soon forced to cut the first shipment number in half following an earthquake in &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, which Nintendo claimed had damaged their cartridge manufacturing facilities. Regardless, speculation arose that Nintendo was instead using the event as an excuse to limit shipment and keep the demand high.\nAs a precursor to the North American release, \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were displayed for audiences to interact with at the 2000 &lt;a href=\"American%20International%20Toy%20Fair\"&gt;American International Toy Fair&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. To further promote the games, Nintendo modified five &lt;a href=\"Chrysler%20PT%20Cruiser\"&gt;Chrysler PT Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s to resemble the new Pok\u00e9mon &lt;a href=\"Lugia\"&gt;Lugia&lt;/a&gt; and had them driven around the United States. The vehicles had fins and tails attached to them and were painted with logos and images of the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" franchise. In addition, they were equipped with a television set hooked up to game consoles which allowed spectators to play \"&lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Puzzle%20League\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Hey%20You%2C%20Pikachu%21\"&gt;Hey You, Pikachu!&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\". The television series \"Pok\u00e9mon GS\", based on the games, was announced to be a part of the fall lineup on &lt;a href=\"Kids%27%20WB\"&gt;Kids' WB&lt;/a&gt;. The show features the same protagonist &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Ketchum\"&gt;Ash Ketchum&lt;/a&gt; in a new region with different Pok\u00e9mon species from the games. The localized English names of the 100 new Pok\u00e9mon were kept confidential by Nintendo, with the company releasing names periodically. The domain names 'pokemongold.com' and 'pokemonsilver.com' were registered for this very purpose, and such names released included &lt;a href=\"Chikorita\"&gt;Chikorita&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lugia\"&gt;Lugia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ho-Oh\"&gt;Ho-Oh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Togepi\"&gt;Togepi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hoothoot\"&gt;Hoothoot&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Marill\"&gt;Marill&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May 2000, Nintendo announced the official North American release date of \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" to be on 16 October of that year. Nintendo started accepting &lt;a href=\"pre-order\"&gt;pre-order&lt;/a&gt;s for the games in August, and announced that consumers who pre-ordered one of the games would receive a free &lt;a href=\"CD-ROM\"&gt;CD-ROM&lt;/a&gt; with a Pok\u00e9mon-themed &lt;a href=\"web%20browser\"&gt;web browser&lt;/a&gt; developed by &lt;a href=\"MediaBrowser\"&gt;MediaBrowser&lt;/a&gt; which featured floating Pok\u00e9mon species and &lt;a href=\"hyperlink\"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; to \"Pok\u00e9mon\" sites. The application was available for download on the official \"Pok\u00e9mon\" website. The games had record sales as approximately 600,000 copies of them were pre-ordered in just two months, compared to \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\"s number of 150,000. As the release date neared, retailers such as &lt;a href=\"EB%20Games\"&gt;Electronics Boutique&lt;/a&gt; reported receiving shipments of the games earlier than 16 October, and opted to sell them immediately; first giving them to pre-orderers and then selling the leftover copies. The games were reportedly obtainable as early as 11 October.\nThe games were released in Australia on 13 October 2000 and in Europe on 6 April 2001.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon Crystal\".\n is an enhanced version of \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\", developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color. It was released in Japan on 14 December 2000, North America on 29 July 2001, and in Europe on 2 November 2001. The plot and gameplay of \"Crystal\" is largely the same as in \"Gold\" and \"Silver\", although it holds several new features.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon Crystal\" was received well by critics, although many commented that there were just not enough new additions and features to significantly set it apart from \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\". \"Pok\u00e9mon Crystal\" has sold nearly 6.4 million units worldwide.\nNintendo 3DS re-release.\nOn 6 June 2017, &lt;a href=\"The%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Company\"&gt;The Pok\u00e9mon Company&lt;/a&gt; announced via a Pok\u00e9mon Direct broadcast that the games would be re-released worldwide via the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%203DS%20Virtual%20Console\"&gt;Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console&lt;/a&gt; on 22 September 2017 . \"Pok\u00e9mon Crystal,\" the enhanced version of \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" was also eventually re-released worldwide on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console, on 26 January 2018.\nReception.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\" were met with critical acclaim, with many saying that the extended length of gameplay and the new features were valued additions that kept the sequels as interesting as the original games. Craig Harris of \"&lt;a href=\"IGN\"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt;\" gave the games a \"masterful\" 10 out of 10 rating, stating that: \"As awesome as the original Pok\u00e9mon edition was, \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\" blow it away in gameplay elements, features, and goodies. There are so many little additions to the design it's impossible to list them all\". There was particular praise given to the innovative internal clock feature, with Frank Povo of \"&lt;a href=\"GameSpot\"&gt;GameSpot&lt;/a&gt;\", noting: \"The first major addition to Pok\u00e9mon GS is the presence of a time element... Although it may sound like a gimmick, the addition of a clock adds quite a bit of variety to the game\".
