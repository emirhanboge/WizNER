    "text": "Angelic acid is a &lt;a href=\"Carboxylic%20acid\"&gt;monocarboxylic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saturated%20and%20unsaturated%20compounds\"&gt;unsaturated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"organic%20acid\"&gt;organic acid&lt;/a&gt;, mostly found in the plants of the family &lt;a href=\"Apiaceae\"&gt;Apiaceae&lt;/a&gt;. It is a volatile solid with a biting taste and pungent sour odor. It is the \"&lt;a href=\"Cis%E2%80%93trans%20isomerism\"&gt;cis&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"isomer\"&gt;isomer&lt;/a&gt; of 2-methyl-2-butenoic acid, which easily converts to the \"trans\" isomer, &lt;a href=\"tiglic%20acid\"&gt;tiglic acid&lt;/a&gt;, upon heating or reaction with inorganic acids. The reverse transformation occurs much less readily. The salts and esters of angelic acid are called angelates. Angelic acid &lt;a href=\"ester\"&gt;ester&lt;/a&gt;s are the active components of herbal medicine used against a wide range of various health disturbances including pains, fever, &lt;a href=\"gout\"&gt;gout&lt;/a&gt;, heartburn, etc.\nName and discovery.\nAngelic acid was first isolated by the German pharmacist Ludwig Andreas Buchner (1813\u20131897) in 1842 from the roots of the garden plant angelica (\"&lt;a href=\"Angelica%20archangelica\"&gt;Angelica archangelica&lt;/a&gt;\"), which gave the acid its name.\nOccurrence.\nAngelic acid occurs in the roots of many plants, especially of the family &lt;a href=\"Apiaceae\"&gt;Apiaceae&lt;/a&gt;. These plants include \"&lt;a href=\"Angelica%20archangelica\"&gt;Angelica archangelica&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Peucedanum%20ostruthium\"&gt;Peucedanum ostruthium&lt;/a&gt;\" (masterwort), \"&lt;a href=\"Levisticum%20officinale\"&gt;Levisticum officinale&lt;/a&gt;\" (lovage), \"&lt;a href=\"Euryangium%20sumbul\"&gt;Euryangium sumbul&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Laserpitium%20latifolium\"&gt;Laserpitium latifolium&lt;/a&gt;\". In the latter plant, it is present in the resin called &lt;a href=\"Silphium%20%28antiquity%29\"&gt;laserpicium&lt;/a&gt;, and the oil of carrot also contains angelic acid. Sumbul plants might contain not angelic acid itself, but a larger complex which breaks into angelic acid upon processing. The acid can also be extracted from the oil of &lt;a href=\"chamomile\"&gt;chamomile&lt;/a&gt; flowers, and 85% of Roman chamomile (\"&lt;a href=\"Anthemis%20nobilis\"&gt;Anthemis nobilis&lt;/a&gt;\") oil consists of esters of angelic and tiglic acids; it also contains isobutyl angelate and amyl angelate. The acid content is highest in \"Angelica archangelica\" where it is about 0.3%.\nProperties.\nAngelic acid is a volatile solid with a biting taste and pungent sour odor. It crystallizes in colorless monoclinic prisms which dissolve rapidly in &lt;a href=\"ethanol\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; or hot water and slowly in cold water. Angelic and &lt;a href=\"tiglic%20acid\"&gt;tiglic acid&lt;/a&gt; are \"&lt;a href=\"Cis%E2%80%93trans%20isomerism\"&gt;cis&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"trans\" isomers of 2-methyl-2-butenoic acid, respectively. The former can be entirely converted to the latter by boiling for about 40 hours, by reaction with &lt;a href=\"sulfuric%20acid\"&gt;sulfuric&lt;/a&gt; and other acids, by heating with a base to a temperature above 100 \u00b0C, or simply by storing the acid for about 25 years. The reverse transformation occurs much less readily; it can be induced by ultraviolet light, but not with visible light. The conversion rate is low and only 0.36 g of angelic acid could be obtained from 13 g of tiglic acid after 43-day irradiation with a 500-watt lamp. Being the \"cis\" isomer, angelic acid has a lower melting point and higher acid dissociation constant than tiglic acid, in accordance to usually observed trends. \nAngelic acid reacts with &lt;a href=\"hydrobromic%20acid\"&gt;hydrobromic acid&lt;/a&gt; and bromine producing &lt;a href=\"valeric%20acid\"&gt;bromovaleric&lt;/a&gt; and dibromovaleric acids, respectively, with a yield of 60\u201370%. Chlorovaleric and iodovaleric acids are obtained using &lt;a href=\"hydrochloric%20acid\"&gt;hydrochloric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hydroiodic%20acid\"&gt;hydroiodic acid&lt;/a&gt;s, respectively. The salts of angelic acid are called angelates. Angelates of &lt;a href=\"alkaline%20earth%20metal\"&gt;alkaline earth metal&lt;/a&gt;s \"M\" have a general formula M(C5H7O2)2 and form white, water-soluble crystals.\nApplications.\nThe angelic acid esters of sesquiterpene alcohols, such as petasin, are the active chemical behind the strong pain-relieving and &lt;a href=\"Muscle%20relaxant\"&gt;spasmolytic&lt;/a&gt; action of extracts from the plant &lt;a href=\"Petasites\"&gt;butterbur&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anthemis%20nobilis\"&gt;Roman chamomile&lt;/a&gt;, in which esters of angelic and tiglic acids are the principal components, was used as a &lt;a href=\"sedative\"&gt;sedative&lt;/a&gt; and tonic, and as a medicine against nervous problems, fever, colic, heartburn, loss of appetite, gout, headache and other health disturbances."
