    "text": "Cleethorpes is a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20Kingdom%20Parliament%20constituencies\"&gt;constituency&lt;/a&gt; created in 1997, represented in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;UK Parliament&lt;/a&gt; since 2010 by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Vickers\"&gt;Martin Vickers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical history.\nCleethorpes is historically considered as a &lt;a href=\"bellwether\"&gt;bellwether&lt;/a&gt; seat, having been won by the party that went on to become the largest in the House of Commons at the seven elections contested from and including 1997 (&lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;-won in &lt;a href=\"1997%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2001%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2005%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;-won in &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2015%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2017%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2019%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;). However, this status may be under threat in the future, as the Conservatives won by a margin of over 20,000 votes in &lt;a href=\"2019%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt; - what is considered a &lt;a href=\"safe%20seat\"&gt;safe seat&lt;/a&gt;. The seat also swung heavily out of step with the nation as a whole from 2010 onwards, including swinging towards the Conservatives moderately in 2017, an election where Labour made significant gains.\nConstituency profile.\nThe seat as it stands since the 2010-implemented boundary reforms forms a broad c-shape as it follows the estuarine south coast of the Humber, ranging from silt to sand along its shore. It is a large part-rural, part-urban seat predominantly on flat alluvial clay in northern &lt;a href=\"Lincolnshire\"&gt;Lincolnshire&lt;/a&gt;. As well as the &lt;a href=\"Cleethorpes\"&gt;eponymous town&lt;/a&gt; itself, the constituency includes similarly commercial &lt;a href=\"Barton-upon-Humber\"&gt;Barton-upon-Humber&lt;/a&gt; and industrial, &lt;a href=\"container%20ship\"&gt;container ship&lt;/a&gt; docks-hosting &lt;a href=\"Immingham\"&gt;Immingham&lt;/a&gt;, as well as many smaller settlements. It surrounds on three sides the seat of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Grimsby%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Great Grimsby&lt;/a&gt; which covers the town of &lt;a href=\"Grimsby\"&gt;Grimsby&lt;/a&gt; and its short shoreline on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Humber\"&gt;River Humber&lt;/a&gt;; its other present neighbours are &lt;a href=\"Brigg%20and%20Goole%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Brigg &amp; Goole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gainsborough%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Gainsborough&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Louth%20and%20Horncastle%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Louth &amp; Horncastle&lt;/a&gt; seats.\nThe Labour vote tends to be stronger around Cleethorpes town itself, in the wards of Croft Baker and Sidney Sussex as well as in Immingham, while the Conservative vote is much stronger across Humberston, Waltham, the rural villages and in parts of Barton.\nBoundaries.\n1997\u20132010: The Borough of North East Lincolnshire wards of Cleethorpes Park, Croft Baker, Haverstoe, Humberston, Immingham, and Wold Parishes, and the Borough of North Lincolnshire wards of Ferry and Wold.\n2010\u2013present: The Borough of North East Lincolnshire wards of Croft Baker, Haverstoe, Humberston and New Waltham, Immingham, Sidney Sussex, Waltham, and Wolds, and the Borough of North Lincolnshire wards of Barton and Ferry."
