    "text": "George Mira Jr. (born c. 1965) is a former an All-American Middle &lt;a href=\"linebacker\"&gt;linebacker&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Miami\"&gt;University of Miami&lt;/a&gt; Hurricanes &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team during the mid-1980s, taking over the reins after the departure of &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Brophy\"&gt;Jay Brophy&lt;/a&gt;. He is also the son of former U.M &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20Mira\"&gt;George Mira&lt;/a&gt; Sr. He had a stellar career at the University of Miami until the 1987 National Championship Game, his last game of his senior year, before which he was suspended by the &lt;a href=\"NCAA\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"diuretics\"&gt;diuretics&lt;/a&gt; use. The suspension endangered his &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28sports%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; status, which sent him down to the 12th round of the &lt;a href=\"1988%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1988 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;, where he was selected by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2049ers\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt;, but did not manage an NFL game.\nHe is now a division chief for MDFR."
