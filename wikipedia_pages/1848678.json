    "text": "Tonbridge Angels Football Club also known as \u201cThe Angels\u201d are an English &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club who play at &lt;a href=\"Longmead%20Stadium\"&gt;Longmead Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tonbridge\"&gt;Tonbridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;, since moving from the &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Ground\"&gt;Angel Ground&lt;/a&gt; in 1980.\nThe club reached the Conference South after winning the play-off final of the &lt;a href=\"Isthmian%20League%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;Isthmian League Premier Division&lt;/a&gt; in the 2010\u201311 season but were relegated back to the Isthmian League in 2014. They competed in that league until they were promoted back to the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20South\"&gt;National League South&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 2018\u201319 season.\nNotable ex-players include &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; international &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Macdonald\"&gt;Malcolm Macdonald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;'s league championship winning manager &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Saunders\"&gt;Ron Saunders&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; manager &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Hodgson\"&gt;Roy Hodgson&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFormation and early history.\nTonbridge Football Club was formed in October 1947 following the suggestion of local businessman and founder chairman Herbert Portch, and was one of four clubs to be elected to the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Southern Football League&lt;/a&gt; for the 1948\u201349 season. The club took out a lease on the &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Ground\"&gt;Angel Ground&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the home of &lt;a href=\"Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Kent County Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt; and named after the nearby hotel, 'The Angel'. Hence Tonbridge FC became known as 'The Angels'. A crowd of around 5,000 turned up for the club's opening league fixture against fellow newcomers &lt;a href=\"Hastings%20United%20F.C.%20%281948%29\"&gt;Hastings United&lt;/a&gt; but the match was lost 2\u20131, with Albert Robson scoring the club's first ever goal. Progress was slow in the early days, with the club rock bottom at Christmas and with &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Hobbis\"&gt;Harold Hobbis&lt;/a&gt; taking over as manager from Dunoon and Marshall Raybould, but the club would improve their form in the second half of the season to finish third from last.\nThroughout the 1950s the Angels (as they were nicknamed at the time, although it was not yet formally part of the club's name) would struggle to make any progress in the Southern League and a peak of 11th place was reached in 1949\u201350, the club's second season. However, Tonbridge would prove to be a strong side in cup competitions. In 1949\u201350, the club reached the semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League%20Cup%20%28England%29\"&gt;Southern League Cup&lt;/a&gt;, losing 3\u20132 to &lt;a href=\"Colchester%20United\"&gt;Colchester United&lt;/a&gt;. In three successive seasons, 1950\u201351, 1951\u201352 and 1952\u201353, Tonbridge reached the First Round Proper of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, only to lose each of the three after a replay. The Angels' opponents were &lt;a href=\"Chelmsford%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelmsford City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aldershot%20F.C.\"&gt;Aldershot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Norwich City&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The Aldershot tie at the Angel Ground saw a record attendance of 8,236, while the Norwich City game was shrouded in controversy, with a late goal at &lt;a href=\"Carrow%20Road\"&gt;Carrow Road&lt;/a&gt; settling the tie. The first trophy to be lifted came in 1951/52 with the Angels winning the Kent Senior Shield. Tonbridge would go on to win this trophy a further four times, in 1956, 1958, 1959 and 1964. Two Southern League Cup finals were reached and lost, beaten in 1954\u201355 by &lt;a href=\"Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Yeovil Town&lt;/a&gt; and two seasons later by &lt;a href=\"Hereford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Hereford United&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Senior%20Cup\"&gt;Kent Senior Cup&lt;/a&gt; finals were also lost in 1956\u201357 and 1958\u201359. The club were relegated from the Premier Division in 1961\u201362, but were promoted two seasons later finishing in 4th place after narrowly missing out the year before. However the club were then relegated back to Division One in 1965\u201366. The notable success of the 1960s was the achievement of reaching the First Round Proper for a fourth time, this time being knocked out 1\u20130 by &lt;a href=\"Dagenham%20%26amp%3B%20Redbridge%20F.C.\"&gt;Dagenham&lt;/a&gt;. The club also won the Kent Senior Cup for the first time in 1964\u201365.\nIn 1972\u201373 the Angels won promotion to the Premier Division by finishing as runners-up to &lt;a href=\"Maidstone%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Maidstone United&lt;/a&gt;. In the same season the First Round Proper of the FA Cup was reached once again as &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Charlton Athletic&lt;/a&gt; were the visitors to the Angel Ground. A crowd of 7,770 saw Charlton win 5\u20130. Tonbridge won the Kent Senior Cup in 1974\u201375 while managed by former World Cup winner &lt;a href=\"George%20Cohen\"&gt;George Cohen&lt;/a&gt;. After struggling to stay in the Premier Division, the club suffered financial troubles and went into voluntary liquidation in 1976. Tonbridge Angels FC was then formed and allowed to complete the fixture list on the understanding that relegation would result at the end of the 1975\u201376 season, wherever the club finished. Another major problem loomed soon after. The club's landlords, the local council, wanted the Angel Ground for development. A battle lasting up to three years that went as far as the High Courts ensued before the club was eventually offered a new ground at Longmead, its present home. The appropriately named Micky Angel scored the last goal at the old Angel Ground in 1980.\nMove to Longmead Stadium: 1980\u20132004.\nFormer Tonbridge and &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Burns\"&gt;Tony Burns&lt;/a&gt; took over as manager for the 1980\u201381 season and the club's new Longmead Stadium hosted its first game on 18 August 1980, a crowd of 701 watching a Southern League Cup game against &lt;a href=\"Crawley%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Crawley Town&lt;/a&gt;. Despite having a new home, finances proved to be a problem for the club. Burns departed for &lt;a href=\"Gravesend%20%26amp%3B%20Northfleet%20F.C.\"&gt;Gravesend &amp; Northfleet&lt;/a&gt; in December 1982 to be replaced by John Keirs, who took the club to fourth place in the 1983\u201384 season, promotion only denied to the Angels on the final day of the season. Phil Emblen took over the reins in July 1985 and led the club to another Southern League Semi Final appearance in 1987, but his departure along with several key players at the end of the 1987\u201388 season led to a slump in the 40th anniversary season.\n1988\u201389 proved to be a disaster for the club. Former &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt; man &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Naylor\"&gt;Terry Naylor&lt;/a&gt; took charge and lasted for just seven games, in that time only managing to earn a single drawn match. With the Angels at the bottom of the league Tommy Sampson came in to try to steady the ship but the damage was already done. The Angels bade farewell to the Southern League after 40 years, relegation to the &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Football%20League\"&gt;Kent League&lt;/a&gt; being the club's \"reward\" after ending the season in next to bottom spot.\nThe Angels regrouped for the 1989\u201390 season with former player and manager Tony Burns returning to manage the club for a second time. Tonbridge finished in a worthy third place, not enough for a quick return to Southern League football, but silverware was forthcoming in the form of the Kent League Cup. Another former manager returned for the 1990\u201391 season, Phil Emblen, and he sparked a revival in the club's fortunes. Emblen patiently built a winning team and after two fourth-placed finishes, money-spinning Cup runs and another Kent League Cup win, the title finally arrived at Longmead in the 1992\u201393 season. And so, after a few seasons away, Tonbridge returned to the league which they had graced for so many years.\nThe Angels briefly topped the Southern Division on their return to Southern League football in the 1993\u201394 season but settled for a mid-table finish, which was to be repeated the following season. The club struggled in the 1995\u201396 season with Phil Emblen resigning as Manager in February 1996 to be replaced by Bill Roffey and the club finished in 18th position. In 1996\u201397 Tonbridge had an improved season finishing in 8th place and in the summer of 1997 &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Emblen\"&gt;Paul Emblen&lt;/a&gt; broke the club's record transfer fee, moving to Charlton Athletic for \u00a37,000. He was later transferred to &lt;a href=\"Wycombe%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wycombe Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a360,000. His brother, ex-Angel Neil, has appeared for &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20F.C.\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.\"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt; and Norwich City.\nAfter a disappointing start to the 1997\u201398 season Colin Blewden took over as Player-Manager in October and hauled the club away from the relegation zone to finish in 14th place and led the Angels to a 16th-place finish in 1998\u201399. The 1999\u20132000 season was the club's most successful since re-joining the Southern League. A run of fourteen games at the end of the season, in which just one defeat was suffered, secured a final league placing of seventh. The following season, it appeared that the Angels might better that seventh-place finish. A storming start to the season saw just two of their first nineteen league matches lost. However, a run of five defeats in six matches late on left the Angels in eighth spot come the end of the season.\nThe 2001\u201302 season was not a successful one for the club. Blewden resigned in October and Tonbridge were one of several clubs involved in a relegation dogfight. They escaped the drop by winning two and drawing one of their last four matches, leaving them four points ahead of relegated &lt;a href=\"Wisbech%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Wisbech Town&lt;/a&gt; at the end.\nAlan Walker was appointed manager at the start of season 2002\u201303 and that season was arguably the most successful since joining the Southern League, the club eventually finishing ninth after a fine end of season run. That run continued into the 2003\u201304 with a club record of 26 league matches unbeaten being ended in December 2003, at which point the Angels were comfortable leaders of the Eastern Division. Walker left the club shortly after due to a loss of sponsorship and the Angels replaced him with player-manager Tony Dolby. After an initial period of mixed results, Dolby steadied the ship and brought in Mike Rutherford as assistant coach before keeping the Angels in the title battle until the penultimate game of the season. The Angels finally finished in third, the club's highest position in the Southern League for more than 25 years.\nIsthmian League and Conference South: 2004\u2013present.\nThe 2004 reorganisation of the &lt;a href=\"English%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;English football league system&lt;/a&gt; saw the Angels placed in the &lt;a href=\"Isthmian%20League\"&gt;Isthmian League&lt;/a&gt; Premier Division. They were relegated in their first season but bounced back at the first attempt, in the most dramatic of fashions, after a rollercoaster 2005\u201306 season. Tonbridge were undefeated until October but a bad run of results threatened to undermine the promotion bid, but the Angels always did enough to stay in the play-off places and a late surge secured third place and with it home advantage in the play-offs. &lt;a href=\"Tooting%20%26amp%3B%20Mitcham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Tooting &amp; Mitcham&lt;/a&gt; were defeated in the Semi-Final match before a dream Final pitted the Angels at home to old Kent rivals &lt;a href=\"Dover%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Dover Athletic&lt;/a&gt;. The Lilywhites were beaten 3\u20132 in front of a new record Longmead Stadium attendance of 1,863.\nThe Angels finished the 2006\u201307 season in 11th place with striker Jon Main scoring 44 goals in all competitions. They then went on to better that by finishing 8th in 2007\u201308, missing out on the playoffs by a matter of points, despite having been languishing second from bottom when new manager Tommy Warrilow took over. Season 2008\u201309 saw the Angels finish in third place, reaching the play-off semi-final where they lost to &lt;a href=\"Carshalton%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Carshalton Athletic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 2010\u201311 season the team confirmed a play-off place with the final league game. They beat &lt;a href=\"Harrow%20Borough%20F.C.\"&gt;Harrow Borough&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20132 in the play-off semi-final to set up a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Lowestoft%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Lowestoft Town&lt;/a&gt; in the final. Tonbridge won the game 4\u20133 with Lewis Taylor scoring the winner just 10 minutes from the end to confirm the Angels' promotion into the &lt;a href=\"Conference%20South\"&gt;Conference South&lt;/a&gt; for the 2011\u201312 season, the highest achievement ever by the club.\nThe club's inaugural campaign in the Conference South saw them finish in 9th place after enjoying a moderately successful season.\nThe following season, the club narrowly escaped relegation and reached the &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Senior%20Cup\"&gt;Kent Senior Cup&lt;/a&gt; finals where they lost 7\u20131 at home to a Charlton XI.\nThe Angels were relegated from the Conference South to the Isthmian League Premier for the start of the 2014/15 season. Manager Tommy Warrilow left the club after 7 years to be replaced by long-term Sutton United coach Steve McKimm.\nThe Angels remained in the Isthmian League Premier division until the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;2018\u201319&lt;/a&gt; season. During the 2018/19 season they finished 4th place and gained a spot in the play-offs. Tonbridge played 3rd place &lt;a href=\"Haringey%20Borough%20F.C.\"&gt;Haringey Borough&lt;/a&gt; away in the semi-final and beat them 2\u20131. The final of the play-offs would be played against 5th placed &lt;a href=\"Merstham%20F.C.\"&gt;Merstham&lt;/a&gt; in a game that the Angels won 2\u20130 at home in front of a crowd of 2,268. Owing to a change in the National League structure for the 2018\u201319 season, this meant that Tonbridge would have to play a further '&lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20National%20League%23Step%203%20Super%20Playoffs\"&gt;Step 3 Super Play-off&lt;/a&gt;' final against the winners of the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Southern%20Football%20League%23Premier%20Division%20South\"&gt;Southern Football League Premier Division South&lt;/a&gt; play-offs, &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Police%20F.C.\"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt;. This took place on 11 May 2019 and Tonbridge ended up the victors after a 3\u20132 win after extra time away at Met's ground. This victory gained Tonbridge promotion to the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20South\"&gt;National League South&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20National%20League%23National%20League%20South\"&gt;2019\u201320 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommunity ownership.\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, steps were taken by supporters to purchase shares in the club to make it majority owned by supporters. They will contest the 2015\u201316 pre-season &lt;a href=\"Supporters%20Direct\"&gt;Supporters Direct&lt;/a&gt; shield, with their first match against &lt;a href=\"Fisher%20F.C.\"&gt;Fisher F.C.&lt;/a&gt; on 25 July.\nStadium.\nThe club plays their home games at &lt;a href=\"Longmead%20Stadium\"&gt;Longmead Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, Darenth Avenue, Tonbridge TN10 3JF. The stadium has a capacity of 3,000 people. Covered terraces are in place behind each goal, which were named after the Mezzanine Floor Company who helped build them. In 2008 the North Stand was renamed The Jack Maddams Stand in memory of the young player who died that year. In the same year, the club installed over 760 seats in the West Stand which was brought over from the old &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Ground\"&gt;Angel Ground&lt;/a&gt; when the club first moved to the Longmead.\nRecords.\nAttendance.\nDuring the club's Kent League days, Longmead Stadium's record attendance for a competitive match was remarkably beaten three times in ten days during a memorable &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; run. After an abandoned 3rd Qualifying Round replay with &lt;a href=\"Hampton%20%26amp%3B%20Richmond%20Borough%20F.C.\"&gt;Hampton&lt;/a&gt; in front of over 800 fans, the game was rearranged and drew an impressive attendance of 1,274. Just five days later the 4th Qualifying Round tie against Yeovil drew a crowd of 1,483. Season 1997\u201398 saw an attendance of 2,412 when the full &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.\"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt; first team squad appeared for a charity match in aid of two local hospices, making 30 March 1998 a memorable evening in the club's history. The current record attendance for a competitive match at Longmead is 2,411, which was set on 7 May 2011 in the &lt;a href=\"Isthmian%20League%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;Isthmian League Premier Division&lt;/a&gt; play-Off final against &lt;a href=\"Lowestoft%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Lowestoft Town&lt;/a&gt;. The largest attendance for any game by the club was witnessed at the &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Ground\"&gt;Angel Ground&lt;/a&gt; where an FA Cup tie in 1951\u201352 against &lt;a href=\"Aldershot%20F.C.\"&gt;Aldershot&lt;/a&gt; was attended by 8,236 spectators.\nBiggest win/defeat.\nThe Angels\u2019 biggest win came about in the FA Cup in 1951 (Angel Ground) when &lt;a href=\"Worthing%20F.C.\"&gt;Worthing&lt;/a&gt; were beaten 11\u20131. Two seasons before that a 2\u201311 loss at &lt;a href=\"Folkestone%20Invicta%20F.C.\"&gt;Folkestone&lt;/a&gt; in the Kent Senior Cup had given the club its record defeat. The biggest win at Longmead Stadium was on 5 September 2017 when the Angels defeated &lt;a href=\"Herne%20Bay%20F.C.\"&gt;Herne Bay&lt;/a&gt; 10\u20131 in the Isthmian League Cup.\nGoalscoring.\nKevin McCurley had held the record for goals in a season for 45 years, having amassed 40 goals in 1961\u201362. His record was finally beaten by prolific striker Jon Main who scored 44 goals. This tally included seven hat-tricks which was a record for trebles in a season, and also equalled the record for career hat-tricks set by Jimmy Constantine in the 1950s. Main claimed this record in October 2007 by scoring an eighth treble against &lt;a href=\"Stotfold%20F.C.\"&gt;Stotfold&lt;/a&gt; in the FA Cup."
