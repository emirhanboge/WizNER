    "title": "Lambert's cosine law",
    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"optics\"&gt;optics&lt;/a&gt;, Lambert's cosine law says that the &lt;a href=\"radiant%20intensity\"&gt;radiant intensity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"luminous%20intensity\"&gt;luminous intensity&lt;/a&gt; observed from an ideal &lt;a href=\"diffuse%20reflection\"&gt;diffusely reflecting&lt;/a&gt; surface or ideal diffuse radiator is &lt;a href=\"directly%20proportional\"&gt;directly proportional&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"cosine\"&gt;cosine&lt;/a&gt; of the angle \"\u03b8\" between the direction of the incident light and the &lt;a href=\"Normal%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;surface normal; I = I0cos(\"\u03b8\")&lt;/a&gt;. The law is also known as the cosine emission law or Lambert's emission law. It is named after &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Heinrich%20Lambert\"&gt;Johann Heinrich Lambert&lt;/a&gt;, from his \"&lt;a href=\"Photometria\"&gt;Photometria&lt;/a&gt;\", published in 1760.\nA surface which obeys Lambert's law is said to be \"Lambertian\", and exhibits &lt;a href=\"Lambertian%20reflectance\"&gt;Lambertian reflectance&lt;/a&gt;. Such a surface has the same &lt;a href=\"radiance\"&gt;radiance&lt;/a&gt; when viewed from any angle. This means, for example, that to the human eye it has the same apparent brightness (or &lt;a href=\"luminance\"&gt;luminance&lt;/a&gt;). It has the same radiance because, although the emitted power from a given area element is reduced by the cosine of the emission angle, the solid angle, subtended by surface visible to the viewer, is reduced by the same very amount. Because the ratio between power and solid angle is constant, radiance (power per unit solid angle per unit projected source area) stays the same.\nLambertian scatterers and radiators.\nWhen an area element is radiating as a result of being illuminated by an external source, the &lt;a href=\"irradiance\"&gt;irradiance&lt;/a&gt; (energy or photons/time/area) landing on that area element will be proportional to the cosine of the angle between the illuminating source and the normal. A Lambertian scatterer will then scatter this light according to the same cosine law as a Lambertian emitter. This means that although the radiance of the surface depends on the angle from the normal to the illuminating source, it will not depend on the angle from the normal to the observer. For example, if the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; were a Lambertian scatterer, one would expect to see its scattered brightness appreciably diminish towards the &lt;a href=\"terminator%20%28solar%29\"&gt;terminator&lt;/a&gt; due to the increased angle at which sunlight hit the surface. The fact that it does not diminish illustrates that the moon is not a Lambertian scatterer, and in fact tends to scatter more light into the &lt;a href=\"oblique%20angle\"&gt;oblique angle&lt;/a&gt;s than a Lambertian scatterer.\nThe emission of a Lambertian radiator does not depend on the amount of incident radiation, but rather from radiation originating in the emitting body itself. For example, if the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; were a Lambertian radiator, one would expect to see a constant brightness across the entire solar disc. The fact that the sun exhibits &lt;a href=\"limb%20darkening\"&gt;limb darkening&lt;/a&gt; in the visible region illustrates that it is not a Lambertian radiator. A &lt;a href=\"black%20body\"&gt;black body&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a Lambertian radiator.\nDetails of equal brightness effect.\nThe situation for a Lambertian surface (emitting or scattering) is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. For conceptual clarity we will think in terms of &lt;a href=\"photon\"&gt;photon&lt;/a&gt;s rather than &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"luminous%20energy\"&gt;luminous energy&lt;/a&gt;. The wedges in the &lt;a href=\"circle\"&gt;circle&lt;/a&gt; each represent an equal angle \"d\"\u03a9, of an arbitrarily chosen size, and for a Lambertian surface, the number of photons per second emitted into each wedge is proportional to the area of the wedge.\nThe length of each wedge is the product of the &lt;a href=\"diameter\"&gt;diameter&lt;/a&gt; of the circle and cos(\"\u03b8\"). The maximum rate of photon emission per unit &lt;a href=\"solid%20angle\"&gt;solid angle&lt;/a&gt; is along the normal, and diminishes to zero for \"\u03b8\" = 90\u00b0. In mathematical terms, the &lt;a href=\"radiance\"&gt;radiance&lt;/a&gt; along the normal is \"I\"\u00a0photons/(s\u00b7m2\u00b7sr) and the number of photons per second emitted into the vertical wedge is . The number of photons per second emitted into the wedge at angle \"\u03b8\" is .\nFigure 2 represents what an observer sees. The observer directly above the area element will be seeing the scene through an aperture of area \"dA\"0 and the area element \"dA\" will subtend a (solid) angle of \"d\"\u03a90, which is a portion of the observer's total angular field-of-view of the scene. Since the wedge size \"d\"\u03a9 was chosen arbitrarily, for convenience we may assume without loss of generality that it coincides with the solid angle subtended by the aperture when \"viewed\" from the locus of the emitting area element dA. Thus the normal observer will then be recording the same photons per second emission derived above and will measure a radiance of\nThe observer at angle \"\u03b8\" to the normal will be seeing the scene through the same aperture of area \"dA\"0 (still corresponding to a \"d\"\u03a9 wedge) and from this oblique vantage the area element \"dA\" is foreshortened and will subtend a (solid) angle of \"d\"\u03a90\u00a0cos(\"\u03b8\"). This observer will be recording photons per second, and so will be measuring a radiance of\nwhich is the same as the normal observer.\nRelating peak luminous intensity and luminous flux.\nIn general, the &lt;a href=\"luminous%20intensity\"&gt;luminous intensity&lt;/a&gt; of a point on a surface varies by direction; for a Lambertian surface, that distribution is defined by the cosine law, with peak luminous intensity in the normal direction. Thus when the Lambertian assumption holds, we can calculate the total &lt;a href=\"luminous%20flux\"&gt;luminous flux&lt;/a&gt;, formula_3, from the peak &lt;a href=\"luminous%20intensity\"&gt;luminous intensity&lt;/a&gt;, formula_4, by integrating the cosine law:\nformula_5\nand so\nwhere formula_7 is the determinant of the &lt;a href=\"Jacobian%20matrix\"&gt;Jacobian matrix&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"unit%20sphere\"&gt;unit sphere&lt;/a&gt;, and realizing that formula_4 is luminous flux per &lt;a href=\"steradian\"&gt;steradian&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, the peak intensity will be formula_9 of the total radiated luminous flux. For Lambertian surfaces, the same factor of formula_10 relates &lt;a href=\"luminance\"&gt;luminance&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"luminous%20emittance\"&gt;luminous emittance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"radiant%20intensity\"&gt;radiant intensity&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"radiant%20flux\"&gt;radiant flux&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"radiance\"&gt;radiance&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"radiant%20emittance\"&gt;radiant emittance&lt;/a&gt;. Radians and steradians are, of course, dimensionless and so \"rad\" and \"sr\" are included only for clarity.\nExample: A surface with a luminance of say 100\u00a0cd/m2 (= 100 nits, typical PC monitor) will, if it is a perfect Lambert emitter, have a luminous emittance of 100\u03c0 lm/m2. If its area is 0.1 m2 (~19\" monitor) then the total light emitted, or luminous flux, would thus be 31.4 lm."
