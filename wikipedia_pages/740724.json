He has two other brothers who also played rugby at representative level: Marty, who played for Auckland and Southland; and &lt;a href=\"Robin%20Brooke\"&gt;Robin&lt;/a&gt;, who played &lt;a href=\"Lock%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt; for Auckland and New Zealand.\nBrooke played 58 &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%23Major%20international%20competitions\"&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt; for New Zealand, and 42 non-international matches for the &lt;a href=\"All%20Blacks\"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt;, captained &lt;a href=\"Blues%20%28Super%20Rugby%29\"&gt;Auckland Blues&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Super%2012\"&gt;Super 12&lt;/a&gt; championships in 1996 and 1997 and was an influential figure in &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Auckland's&lt;/a&gt; dominance in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Provincial%20Championship%20%281976%E2%80%932005%29\"&gt;National Provincial Championship&lt;/a&gt; during the late 1980s and 1990s. He scored 17 tries in test matches, then a world record for a forward. A member of the &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ori%20people\"&gt;M\u0101ori&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ng%C4%81puhi\"&gt;Ng\u0101puhi&lt;/a&gt; iwi, he also played for &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20M%C4%81ori%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;New Zealand M\u0101ori&lt;/a&gt;.\nRugby career.\nBrooke was a founding player of the &lt;a href=\"Southerners%20Sports%20Club%20%28Bangkok%29\"&gt;Southerners Sports Club (Bangkok)&lt;/a&gt;, playing in the inaugural side in 1994 against Taradale RFC. In 1995 he published his autobiography \"Zinny: The Zinzan Brooke story\", written with Alex Veysey.\nBrooke is considered one of the best &lt;a href=\"Number%20eight%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;number eight&lt;/a&gt;s to have ever played for the &lt;a href=\"All%20Blacks\"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt;. He had the running and kicking skills of a backline player which made him extremely mobile and agile as a forward. He once kicked a 48-metre &lt;a href=\"drop%20goal\"&gt;drop goal&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"1995%20Rugby%20Union%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1995 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; match, one of three he scored in test matches.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1997%20New%20Year%20Honours%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;1997 New Year Honours&lt;/a&gt;, Brooke was appointed a &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20the%20New%20Zealand%20Order%20of%20Merit\"&gt;Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit&lt;/a&gt;, for services to rugby.\nBrooke scored his third drop goal during the All Blacks' impressive 42\u20137 win against &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on 29 November 1997, giving him the rare distinction of being the only rugby player to have \"scored a goal at Wembley\". He also set up a try for &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Cullen\"&gt;Christian Cullen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2007, former England centre and captain &lt;a href=\"Will%20Carling\"&gt;Will Carling&lt;/a&gt; published his list of the '50 Greatest Rugby players' in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\", and ranked Brooke the ninth greatest player of all time, stating: \"For a forward his skills were outrageous. As comfortable playing sevens as 15s, he had better kicking and handling skills than some fly-halves playing international rugby. You align that with his strength and ability as a forward to read the game \u2013 he was unique\".\nRetirement.\nIn 1997 he retired from international rugby union and moved to England to play for &lt;a href=\"Harlequin%20F.C.\"&gt;Harlequins&lt;/a&gt;, and later coach it. During the 2002/03 season he played for &lt;a href=\"Coventry%20R.F.C.\"&gt;Coventry&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"National%20Division%20One\"&gt;National Division One&lt;/a&gt;. He now plays amateur rugby union for &lt;a href=\"Windsor%2C%20Berkshire\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt; Rugby Club in Berkshire, England.\nIn 2011, while back in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2011 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Brooke was inducted into the TVNZ &lt;a href=\"This%20Is%20Your%20Life%20%28New%20Zealand%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;This Is Your Life&lt;/a&gt; wall of fame. \nHis family joined him from &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Auckland\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; Viaduct for the live show. Special guests included his four brothers, &lt;a href=\"Buck%20Shelford\"&gt;Buck Shelford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Jones%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Michael Jones&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrooke ran Frances Lodge, a boutique &lt;a href=\"bed%20and%20breakfast\"&gt;bed and breakfast&lt;/a&gt; in Windsor, Berkshire, with his wife. However, it closed when both Brooke and his wife were declared bankrupt in the UK in August 2012.\nBrooke suffered head trauma in May 2007 while falling out of a taxi in the Spanish town of &lt;a href=\"Elche\"&gt;Elche&lt;/a&gt;, though the circumstances are unclear.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; outbreak, Brooke posted covid &lt;a href=\"Disinformation\"&gt;disinformation&lt;/a&gt; on masks and support for unproven treatments such as &lt;a href=\"Ivermectin\"&gt;Ivermectin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hydroxychloroquine\"&gt;Hydroxychloroquine&lt;/a&gt;. These claims were criticized by New Zealand Scientists such as &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Baker%20%28epidemiologist%29\"&gt;Michael Baker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Siouxsie%20Wiles\"&gt;Siouxsie Wiles&lt;/a&gt; calling on Brooke to engage with scientists and to seek out \"reputable sources\".\nName.\nZinzan Brooke's unusual first name has a long history in the Brooke family, though its origins are uncertain. It has been suggested that it may be an anglicised Italian or Albanian name. The name links Brooke's family with another notable New Zealand sporting family, that of cricketer &lt;a href=\"Zin%20Harris\"&gt;Zin Harris&lt;/a&gt; and his sons &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Harris%20%28cricketer%29\"&gt;Chris Z. Harris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Harris%20%28cricketer%29\"&gt;Ben Z. Harris&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom are distant relatives of the Brookes."
