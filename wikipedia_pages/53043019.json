    "text": "The Battle of Orford Ness was a naval battle fought between a southbound &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Empire\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; convoy escorted by the Swedish warship \"\u00d6land\" and an &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; squadron of eight &lt;a href=\"ship%20of%20the%20line\"&gt;ships of the line&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Orford%20Ness\"&gt;Orford Ness&lt;/a&gt; on 27 July 1704 (&lt;a href=\"Julian%20calendar\"&gt;Julian calendar&lt;/a&gt;). The English squadron started to follow the Swedish convoy upon sighting it and when they caught up with the Swedes, demanded a salute due to Psilander being in English waters. The Swedish commander &lt;a href=\"Gustaf%20von%20Psilander\"&gt;Gustaf von Psilander&lt;/a&gt;, under strict orders from his king not to, refused (in order to avoid damaging his nation's honor). A four-hour battle ensued, with the heavily damaged \"\u00d6land\" being captured alongside the convoyed merchant ships. The Swedish Board of Admiralty and Board of Trade refused to demand for his release or support Psilander while he was in captivity, but &lt;a href=\"Charles%20XII\"&gt;Charles XII&lt;/a&gt; was of a different opinion and successfully demanded the release of the warship and crew. Psilander, his crew, and the convoyed ships were later released and returned to Sweden. However, \"\u00d6land\" later sank north of &lt;a href=\"Denmark-Norway\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; while homebound."
