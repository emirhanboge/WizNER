Soon after formation, the firm moved to Thavies Inn at &lt;a href=\"Holborn%20Circus\"&gt;Holborn Circus&lt;/a&gt; and later to &lt;a href=\"Serjeant%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Serjeant's Inn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Street\"&gt;Fleet Street&lt;/a&gt;, before moving to 21 &lt;a href=\"Holborn%20Viaduct\"&gt;Holborn Viaduct&lt;/a&gt; in October 1977.\nLovells was formed as a result of a number of earlier mergers.
