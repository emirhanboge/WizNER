    "text": "The East Gallatin River flows in a northwesterly direction through the Gallatin valley, &lt;a href=\"Gallatin%20County%2C%20Montana\"&gt;Gallatin County, Montana&lt;/a&gt;. Rising from the confluence of Rocky Creek and several other small streams, the East Gallatin begins about one mile (1.6\u00a0km) east of downtown &lt;a href=\"Bozeman%2C%20Montana\"&gt;Bozeman, Montana&lt;/a&gt;. The river joins the main stem of the &lt;a href=\"Gallatin%20River\"&gt;Gallatin River&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Manhattan%2C%20Montana\"&gt;Manhattan, Montana&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout its course, the river traverses mostly valley floor ranch and farm land with typical summer flows of approximately .\nAngling the East Gallatin.\nThe East Gallatin river is a popular trout fishing stream and holds good populations of &lt;a href=\"Rainbow%20trout\"&gt;rainbow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"brown%20trout\"&gt;brown trout&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"mountain%20whitefish\"&gt;mountain whitefish&lt;/a&gt;. Access is limited to country road crossings and two public assess sites maintained by the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks department. Numerous &lt;a href=\"spring%20creek\"&gt;spring creek&lt;/a&gt;s, most notably Ben Hart and Thompson, feed the East Gallatin throughout its course and provide excellent trout fishing as well."
