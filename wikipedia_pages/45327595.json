In various European countries this type of house was known as \"immeuble de rapport\", \"h\u00f4tel de rapport\" (&lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;); \"inmueble de inversi\u00f3n\", \"inmueble de alquiler\" (&lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;), (&lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;), etc.\nIn France, the spreading of the revenue houses started since the reign of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XVI%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XVI&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, it became a popular investment by &lt;a href=\"real%20estate%20developer\"&gt;real estate developer&lt;/a&gt;s, which resulted in repeated use of the same type of &lt;a href=\"fa%C3%A7ade\"&gt;fa\u00e7ade&lt;/a&gt;s and overall architecture of the buildings. The proliferation of this kind of property is responsible for the uniformity of the &lt;a href=\"architecture%20of%20Paris\"&gt;architecture of Paris&lt;/a&gt; today."
