    "text": "The Andorran Union (, UA) was an &lt;a href=\"Andorra\"&gt;Andorran&lt;/a&gt; political formation established in 1933, during the heat of the &lt;a href=\"Andorran%20Revolution\"&gt;Andorran Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. The formation defended &lt;a href=\"universal%20male%20suffrage\"&gt;universal male suffrage&lt;/a&gt;, the creation of a status of Andorran nationality and the &lt;a href=\"General%20Council%20%28Andorra%29\"&gt;General Council&lt;/a&gt; that was dismissed by the French occupation forces.\nHistory.\nThe party was created by the \"Young Andorrans\" (, JA) in the midst of the 1933 revolution, after the threats of both co-princes to intervene in Andorran internal affairs after the approval of universal male suffrage by the General Council. The councilors who were part of this formation ran in the &lt;a href=\"1933%20Andorran%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1933 Andorran parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; where, according to the data of the time, five general councilors from the Andorran Union were elected: one councilor in &lt;a href=\"Les%20Escaldes\"&gt;Les Escaldes&lt;/a&gt; and the remaining four in &lt;a href=\"Canillo\"&gt;Canillo&lt;/a&gt;, where all the winning candidates were from this formation. Four additional seats were won by Andorran &lt;a href=\"socialists\"&gt;socialists&lt;/a&gt;, but the election of 14 general councilors from the &lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; Integral Nationalist Group (, GNI) meant the defeat of these ideas.
