    "text": "Pre-installed iOS apps, referred to in the &lt;a href=\"App%20Store%20%28iOS/iPadOS%29\"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; as 'Built-In Apps', are a suite of &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20app\"&gt;mobile applications&lt;/a&gt; developed by &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Inc.\"&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; which are bundled with &lt;a href=\"iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and installed by default or through a system update. Many of the default apps found on iOS have counterparts on Apple's other operating systems &lt;a href=\"macOS\"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iPadOS\"&gt;iPadOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"watchOS\"&gt;watchOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"tvOS\"&gt;tvOS&lt;/a&gt;, which are often modified versions of or similar to the iOS application. As each app is integrated into the operating system itself, they often feature greater support for system features than third-party alternatives and are quick to adapt new features of iOS.\nSince &lt;a href=\"iOS%2010\"&gt;iOS 10&lt;/a&gt;, most pre-installed apps have been removable. With &lt;a href=\"iOS%2014\"&gt;iOS 14&lt;/a&gt; or later, as well as &lt;a href=\"iPadOS%2015\"&gt;iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; or later, users can hide pre-installed apps in the newly introduced App Library, as well as change their default &lt;a href=\"web%20browser\"&gt;web browser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"email%20client\"&gt;email client&lt;/a&gt; to a third-party alternative.\nApplications.\nApp Store.\nThe App Store is a &lt;a href=\"digital%20distribution\"&gt;digital distribution&lt;/a&gt; platform which allows users to browse and download apps developed with Apple's &lt;a href=\"iOS%20Software%20Development%20Kit\"&gt;iOS Software Development Kit&lt;/a&gt;. The App Store opened on July 10, 2008, with an initial 500 applications available. The number of apps peaked at around 2.2 million in 2017, but declined slightly over the next few years as Apple began a process to remove old apps or 32-bit apps that do not function as intended or that don't follow current app guidelines. As of 2020, the store features around 1.8 million apps. On September 19, 2019, &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Arcade\"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, a gaming subscription service that provides unlimited access to a catalogue of games for a monthly fee, was released through a dedicated tab on the App Store.\nBooks.\nBooks, formerly iBooks, is an &lt;a href=\"e-book\"&gt;e-book&lt;/a&gt; reading and store application released in mid-2010, as part of the &lt;a href=\"iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; 4 update. Initially, iBooks was not pre-loaded onto iOS devices, but users could install it free of charge from the &lt;a href=\"App%20Store%20%28iOS%29\"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;. With the release of &lt;a href=\"iOS%208\"&gt;iOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, it became an integrated app. It primarily receives &lt;a href=\"EPUB\"&gt;EPUB&lt;/a&gt; content from the Apple Books store, but users can also add their own EPUB and &lt;a href=\"PDF\"&gt;Portable Document Format&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) files via &lt;a href=\"data%20synchronization\"&gt;data synchronization&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"iTunes\"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the files can be downloaded to Apple Books through &lt;a href=\"Safari%20%28web%20browser%29\"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt; or Apple Mail.

On the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%207%20Plus\"&gt;iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/a&gt; and above, photos can be taken in 'portrait mode', which creates a depth effect so that the subject is in focus while the background is blurred.
