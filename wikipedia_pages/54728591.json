He played as a winger.\nPlaying career.\nHorder made his debut for North Sydney in the &lt;a href=\"1996%20ARL%20season\"&gt;1996 ARL season&lt;/a&gt; against the Western Reds in Round 11, coming off the bench in a 28-6 victory. This was the second Horder to play for North Sydney, the first being the winger and North Sydney \"Team of the century\" member &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Horder\"&gt;Harold Horder&lt;/a&gt;. Wade Horder is the great nephew of Harold.\nHorder scored his first try for Norths against the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Suburbs%20Roosters\"&gt;Eastern Suburbs Roosters&lt;/a&gt; on 28 March 1998 and then a week later scored a hat-trick against The &lt;a href=\"St%20George%20Dragons\"&gt;St George Dragons&lt;/a&gt;. In Round 6, against the &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Warriors\"&gt;Auckland Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, Horder was involved in a controversial try involving a ball boy. Instead of the ball boy placing the ball on the line, Horder called for the ball which was thrown to him from the touchline, Horder passed it to North Sydney hooker &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Soden\"&gt;Mark Soden&lt;/a&gt; who raced away to score as Auckland did not know what was happening and were not ready. Horder was a member of the 1999 North Sydney squad and played in the final game that North Sydney ever played in first grade: against the &lt;a href=\"North%20Queensland%20Cowboys\"&gt;North Queensland Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; in Townsville. Norths won the match 28-18."
