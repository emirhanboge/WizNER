    "text": "Long Beach City College (LBCC) is a &lt;a href=\"Public%20college\"&gt;public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"community%20college\"&gt;community college&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Long%20Beach%2C%20California\"&gt;Long Beach, California&lt;/a&gt;. It was established in 1927 and is divided into two campuses, the Liberal Arts Campus in &lt;a href=\"Lakewood%20Village%2C%20Long%20Beach%2C%20California\"&gt;Lakewood Village&lt;/a&gt; and the Pacific Coast Campus in central Long Beach on &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20Route%201\"&gt;Pacific Coast Highway&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only college in the Long Beach Community College District.\nLBCC serves &lt;a href=\"San%20Pedro%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;San Pedro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Catalina%20Island%2C%20California\"&gt;Catalina Island&lt;/a&gt; and the cities of &lt;a href=\"Long%20Beach%2C%20California\"&gt;Long Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lakewood%2C%20California\"&gt;Lakewood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Signal%20Hill%2C%20California\"&gt;Signal Hill&lt;/a&gt;. During the 2015\u20132016 academic year, the college had an enrollment of 33,818 students.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1927, Long Beach City College was initially housed at &lt;a href=\"Wilson%20Classical%20High%20School\"&gt;Wilson Classical High School&lt;/a&gt; in southeast Long Beach. The &lt;a href=\"1933%20Long%20Beach%20earthquake\"&gt;1933 Long Beach earthquake&lt;/a&gt; resulted in classes being held at Recreation Park until 1935, when the college moved into its Liberal Arts Campus in &lt;a href=\"Lakewood%20Village%2C%20Long%20Beach%2C%20California\"&gt;Lakewood Village&lt;/a&gt; at Carson Street and Clark Avenue.\nDuring and after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the college increased so rapidly that a new campus had to be established. This was realized in 1949 with the establishment of the Pacific Coast Campus, occupied on the former site of Hamilton Junior High School. As Long Beach City College grew in the 1970s, state law separated the college from the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Beach%20Unified%20School%20District\"&gt;Long Beach Unified School District&lt;/a&gt;. In that decade and the 1980s, &lt;a href=\"Proposition%2013\"&gt;Proposition 13&lt;/a&gt; signaled retrenchment for the college, with many popular classes and services folding.\nAlso during the 1980s, the arrival of refugees from &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt; resulted in the need for extensive courses in the ESL program. This program became the largest at the college due to a later wave of &lt;a href=\"amnesty\"&gt;amnesty&lt;/a&gt; applicants.\n1987 saw the college acquire neighboring &lt;a href=\"Veterans%20Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Long%20Beach%29\"&gt;Veterans Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt; from the City of Long Beach. Even before it acquired the stadium, as far back as the early 1970s, the college was allowed to use its facilities as a practice field and to provide several hundred much-needed parking for students of the college. In recent years, the college has upgraded the stadium playing surface, its swimming pool facility, as well as established wireless internet and e-mail services in 2005.\nBond Measure E has seen the construction of a Child Development Center at the PCC, and construction for new buildings on both campuses are underway, including a new South Quad Complex Building on the formers LAC golf mall, a new Industrial Technology Building at the PCC, and a new East Campus for the Culinary Arts Program.\nName.\nLong Beach Junior College opened its doors at Woodrow Wilson High School in 1927 to 503 students, and in 1935, the college moved to the campus on the corner of Carson and Clark. Reorganization brought together all post-high school education in 1944, resulting in the name becoming Long Beach City College, and splitting into the Liberal Arts Division, the General Adult Division, and Technical Institute Division. The Liberal Arts Division remained on the original Junior College campus, and became known as the Liberal Arts Campus. The General Adult Division and Technical Institute Division offered courses at surrounding educations centers, until a second LBCC campus was opened on the former site of Hamilton Junior High School in 1949 as a result of increased enrollment after World War II. This campus was originally called the Business and Technology Division Campus and eventually became known as the Pacific Coast Campus while the Liberal Arts Campus remained the same.\nAt this time a survey is being conducted to inquire with the Faculty, Staff and Students if they feel that the two campus names should be changed to reflect the current curriculum of each campus.\nCampuses.\nThe campuses are located in Long Beach, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County\"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/a&gt;, California. The Liberal Arts Campus is situated north of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20405%20%28California%29\"&gt;Interstate 405&lt;/a&gt; and south of &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20Route%2091\"&gt;State Highway 91&lt;/a&gt;, along the major roads of Carson Street, which divides the campus in two portions, &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20Route%2019\"&gt;Lakewood Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;, which borders the campus to the west, and Clark Avenue, which borders the campus to the east.\nThe Pacific Coast Campus is situated north of &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20Route%201\"&gt;Pacific Coast Highway&lt;/a&gt;, bordered by Orange Avenue to the west, Walnut Avenue to the east, and Mary Butler School to the north. Year round, there is a mild climate moderated by ocean breezes from the Pacific.\nMost students, faculty and staff commute to campus. &lt;a href=\"Long%20Beach%20Transit\"&gt;Long Beach Transit&lt;/a&gt; serves both campuses, with routes 93, 101, 103, and 112 serving LAC, and routes 71, 171, 172, 173, 174, and 175 serving PCC. Due to the increasing student enrollment, there have been issues regarding parking, and as a consequence, those with parking permits usually arrive early during the first few weeks of each semester to avoid traffic. Recent construction projects from Bond Measure E have aggravated the parking situation, but this will be temporary upon completion.\nStudent support services and programs.\nLong Beach City College offers a variety of Student Support Services and Programs.\nThese programs are:\nCareer &amp; Job Services (LAC/PCC) - Career counselors assist with the exploration and development of career and employment goals.&lt;br&gt;\nCalWORKs (PCC) - Supportive services to county public assistance (welfare) recipients in the form of dedicated CalWORKs counselors, case management, childcare, work-study.&lt;br&gt;\nChild Development Center (LAC/PCC) - Quality child care is given to 2- to 5-year-old children of Long Beach City College students, faculty and staff.&lt;br&gt;\nDisabled Students Programs and Services (LAC/PCC) - DSPS provides many support services that enable students with disabilities to participate in the college's programs and activities including note-takers, readers, interpreters and assistance with registration.&lt;br&gt;\nEnglish as a Second Language Office (PCC) - Provides bilingual information on college services and benefits by ESL Counselors and Advisors, offers the ESL test, and provides assistance with online registration.&lt;br&gt;\nExtended Opportunity Programs &amp; Services (LAC/PCC) - Retention program designed to assist qualified students with educational counseling, priority registration, assistance with transfer and assistance with textbooks/supplies.&lt;br&gt;\nCooperative Agencies Resources for Education (LAC/PCC) - Additional assistance for EOPS students who are single parents, head of household, have at least one child 13 years of age or younger and are participating in &lt;a href=\"CalWORKs\"&gt;CalWORKs&lt;/a&gt; or GAIN.\nHonors Program (LAC/PCC) - Provides classes and programs to prepare high-achieving students for transfer to competitive four-year colleges and universities.&lt;br&gt;\nInternational Students Program (LAC) - Services in immigration matters; academic, career and personal counseling; and housing assistance to international students.&lt;br&gt;\nAmerican Language and Culture Institute (LAC) - Provides English language preparation and an F-1 visa for international students.&lt;br&gt;\nTransfer Center (LAC/PCC) - Helps new and transfer-bound students with registration and transfer workshops, LBCC online access, and assists in communication with university representatives.&lt;br&gt;\nTRIO Go Project (PCC) - Academic, career, financial, and personal advising services for students who are either first-generation college students, low income and/or learning/physically disabled.
