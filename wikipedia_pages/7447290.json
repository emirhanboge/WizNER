    "text": "Club Sportivo Barracas is an Argentine &lt;a href=\"sports%20club\"&gt;sports club&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;. The institution was born as a &lt;a href=\"rowing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;rowing&lt;/a&gt; club, nevertheless it is mostly known for its &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; activities nowadays. The team currently plays in &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth division of the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Argentine football league system&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded on October 30, 1913, in its headquarters still located in the &lt;a href=\"Barrios%20of%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;barrio&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Barracas%2C%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Barracas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, as \"Club Sportivo Barracas\", after Riachuelo F.C. merged to it. The club bought the Riachuelo F.C. facilities on Iriarte and Santa Elena streets to play football there. Riachuelo had played its only season in Primera Divisi\u00f3n in &lt;a href=\"1913%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1913&lt;/a&gt;, being relegated to &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20Intermedia\"&gt;Divisi\u00f3n Intermedia&lt;/a&gt; after finishing last. Sportivo Barracas took its place in the division.\nAs Sportivo Barracas won the Intermedia championship in 1916, it promoted to Primera Divisi\u00f3n. The team made its debut in the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1917%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1917&lt;/a&gt;, finishing 5th. The team played in Primera until the league became professional in &lt;a href=\"1931%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1931&lt;/a&gt;. \nSportivo became one of the clubs to make the decision of staying amateur so it remained at the official body, Argentine Association. This decision paid dividends because the following year Sportivo Barracas won the 1932 championship. It remained unaffiliated to &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Argentine Football Association&lt;/a&gt; from 1936 to 1967, never regaining its amateur notability since its return.\nFollowing an influx of external financial support, the club moved to play its football matches to &lt;a href=\"Bolivar%2C%20Buenos%20Aires%20Province\"&gt;Bolivar, Buenos Aires Province&lt;/a&gt;, in 2003, changing its name to \"Club Sportivo Barracas Bol\u00edvar\", as well as the shirt colors and crest. However, all other activities of the club remained in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2010, the club left the city of Bol\u00edvar, playing its home games at &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Acassuso\"&gt;Acassuso&lt;/a&gt; stadium of &lt;a href=\"San%20Isidro%2C%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;San Isidro, Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;. Sportivo Barracas has a major rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Barracas%20Central\"&gt;Barracas Central&lt;/a&gt;, the other team in the &lt;a href=\"Barracas%2C%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Barracas neighbourhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn March 2011, the club put the image of former President of Argentina &lt;a href=\"N%C3%A9stor%20Kirchner\"&gt;N\u00e9stor Kirchner&lt;/a&gt; on the jersey as a tribute to him. In May 2012, Sportivo Barracas was disaffiliated for one season after finishing last in the Primera D championship. The vacant place was filled by &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Puerto%20Nuevo\"&gt;Puerto Nuevo&lt;/a&gt; which returned to the division.\nIn 2015, Sportivo Barracas won the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20D\"&gt;Primera D&lt;/a&gt; championship, promoting to the upper level.\nStadium.\nIn 1919 the club began works to build its own stadium, &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Sportivo%20Barracas\"&gt;Estadio Sportivo Barracas&lt;/a&gt; on the land next to former Riachuelo F.C. The first official match played at Sportivo Barracas was the &lt;a href=\"1919%20Tie%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1919 Tie Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Boca%20Juniors\"&gt;Boca Juniors&lt;/a&gt; beat Uruguayan team &lt;a href=\"Club%20Nacional%20de%20Football\"&gt;Nacional&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20130. Nevertheless, the stadium was officially inaugurated on July 14, 1920, a friendly game between Rosarian teams &lt;a href=\"Newell%27s%20Old%20Boys\"&gt;Newell's Old Boys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tiro%20Federal\"&gt;Tiro Federal&lt;/a&gt;, won by Newell's 1\u20130. The &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina national team&lt;/a&gt; played its first game there on July 25, 1920, a &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Newton\"&gt;Copa Newton&lt;/a&gt; match v &lt;a href=\"Uruguay%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; attended by 18,000 people. \nIn the 1920s and 1930s the &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Sportivo%20Barracas\"&gt;Sportivo Barracas stadium&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most important stadiums in Argentina. It held 30,000 spectators and was used as a venue for the &lt;a href=\"South%20American%20Championship%201921\"&gt;South American Championship 1921&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20American%20Championship%201925\"&gt;South American Championship 1925&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn important anecdotic fact related to the stadium took place on the match between Argentina and Uruguay, on October 2, 1924. In June of that year, Uruguay had attained the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; football crown at &lt;a href=\"1924%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, which at that moment was a kind of unofficial world title, since the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; was not be played until &lt;a href=\"1930%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1930&lt;/a&gt;. The rivalry between Argentina and Uruguay was already an important one, so the match generated much expectancy. After the Uruguayan title, two matches were to be played between Uruguay and Argentina. The first one was in &lt;a href=\"Montevideo\"&gt;Montevideo&lt;/a&gt; and finished 1\u20131. The second one in Buenos Aires was to be played on September 28, but there were so many people at the stadium that day that the field itself was occupied by supporters. The Uruguayans asked for the suspension of the match and a perimeter to separate people from players on the next encounter, which was finally played on October 2, 1924.\nThat day, before playing the match, the Uruguayans celebrated their Olympic title by circumvallating the field, something described then as \"la vuelta de los ol\u00edmpicos\" (\"the round of the Olympic ones\"), lately just \"vuelta ol\u00edmpica\" (\"Olympic round\"). Argentina won that match 2\u20131 (&lt;a href=\"Ces%C3%A1reo%20Onzari\"&gt;Onzari&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 at 15\u2019, &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Cea\"&gt;Cea&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20131 at 29\u2019, and &lt;a href=\"Domingo%20Tarasconi\"&gt;Tarasconi&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 at 53\u2019), but it was Onzari's &lt;a href=\"goal%20%28sport%29\"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; which was to be remembered, because it was converted directly from a &lt;a href=\"corner%20kick\"&gt;corner kick&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"International%20Football%20Association%20Board\"&gt;International Board&lt;/a&gt; had specifically modified the football &lt;a href=\"Laws%20of%20the%20Game%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; on this point on June 14, 1924, allowing goals to be scored like that. Since then, a goal like Onzari's is referred as a \"Gol ol\u00edmpico\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Olympic%20goal\"&gt;Olympic goal&lt;/a&gt;\" in almost all &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;, and even some parts of &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first time that an Olympic goal is called that way, as well as its the debut of the expression \"vuelta ol\u00edmpica\" in Latin America. Onzari was at that moment playing for &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Hurac%C3%A1n\"&gt;Hurac\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe field was also used in 1925 for the first &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt; fight in open space of &lt;a href=\"Luis%20%C3%81ngel%20Firpo\"&gt;Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo&lt;/a&gt;. From 2003 to 2010 the club played its home games at the Estadio Municipal de Bol\u00edvar."
