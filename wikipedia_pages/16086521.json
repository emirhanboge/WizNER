    "text": "Fran\u00e7ois Colin de Blamont (22 November 1690 \u2013 14 February 1760) was a French composer of the &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20music\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; era.\nBorn at &lt;a href=\"Versailles%20%28city%29\"&gt;Versailles&lt;/a&gt; as Fran\u00e7ois Colin, he served as a royal musician and was eventually ennobled in 1750, his surname becoming \"Colin de Blamont\". He was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Richard%20Delalande\"&gt;Michel Richard Delalande&lt;/a&gt; and succeeded the latter as Master of the Chapelle Royale on his death in 1726. Blamont wrote &lt;a href=\"motet\"&gt;motet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cantata\"&gt;cantata&lt;/a&gt;s as well as stage works, including the &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; \"Les f\u00eates grecques et romaines\", intended to be the first in a new genre, the \"ballet h\u00e9ro\u00efque\", which would challenge the supremacy of the \"&lt;a href=\"op%C3%A9ra-ballet\"&gt;op\u00e9ra-ballet&lt;/a&gt;\"."
