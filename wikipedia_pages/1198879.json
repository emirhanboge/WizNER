He became involved in municipal politics in the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; of Cap-P\u00e9l\u00e9. His second entry into provincial politics was in the &lt;a href=\"1991%20New%20Brunswick%20general%20election\"&gt;1991 election&lt;/a&gt;, this time as a &lt;a href=\"New%20Brunswick%20Liberal%20Association\"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;. He won. He was re-elected in &lt;a href=\"1995%20New%20Brunswick%20general%20election\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1999%20New%20Brunswick%20general%20election\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2003%20New%20Brunswick%20general%20election\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was named to &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Council%20of%20New%20Brunswick\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; in 1995 and left in 1998 to contest the leadership of the Liberal Party. He was unsuccessful in his leadership bid and was returned to the cabinet position by &lt;a href=\"Camille%20Th%C3%A9riault\"&gt;Camille Th\u00e9riault&lt;/a&gt; who was the victor in the contest. Richard managed to be re-election by the largest margin of any candidate in the 1999 election, despite the fact that his party suffering a massive defeat.\nWhen Th\u00e9riault resigned as leader in 2001, Richard briefly considered another run but instead became &lt;a href=\"Interim%20leader%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;interim leader&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Shawn%20Graham\"&gt;Shawn Graham&lt;/a&gt; became leader in 2002, Richard was made &lt;a href=\"House%20Leader\"&gt;House Leader&lt;/a&gt; and finance critic, two key roles in the opposition.

After first attempting to convince a Liberal to sit as &lt;a href=\"speaker%20%28politics%29\"&gt;speaker&lt;/a&gt; and then offering cabinet positions and other appointments to several Liberals, Richard accepted the post of provincial &lt;a href=\"ombudsman\"&gt;ombudsman&lt;/a&gt;, thus resigning his seat and increasing the &lt;a href=\"Tory\"&gt;Tory&lt;/a&gt; majority to 28/54 for the ensuing year before a &lt;a href=\"by-election\"&gt;by-election&lt;/a&gt; was held.\nOn November 6, 2007, New Brunswick news outlets reported that the Progressive Conservatives were encouraging Richard to leave his post as ombudsman and return to politics &lt;a href=\"2008%20Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20New%20Brunswick%20leadership%20election\"&gt;as leader&lt;/a&gt; of their party."
