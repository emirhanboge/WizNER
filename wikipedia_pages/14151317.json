It plays &lt;a href=\"UK%20garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grime%20%28music%29\"&gt;grime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dubstep\"&gt;dubstep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oldschool%20jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UK%20funky\"&gt;funky&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"dance%20music\"&gt;dance music&lt;/a&gt; genres popular in the United Kingdom.\nThe station was founded in 1994 and operated as &lt;a href=\"Pirate%20radio%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;pirate radio station&lt;/a&gt; until it was awarded a community FM broadcast licence in June 2010. Rinse FM has been described as London's biggest pirate radio station. It provided first exposure to &lt;a href=\"Grime%20music\"&gt;grime&lt;/a&gt; artists &lt;a href=\"Dizzee%20Rascal\"&gt;Dizzee Rascal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wiley%20%28rapper%29\"&gt;Wiley&lt;/a&gt; and later provided a home for dubstep DJs such as &lt;a href=\"Skream\"&gt;Skream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kode9\"&gt;Kode9&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Oneman\"&gt;Oneman&lt;/a&gt;. DJ Geeneus is the station's head.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nFounded by DJ Geeneus and &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Slimzee\"&gt;DJ Slimzee&lt;/a&gt;, Rinse FM first broadcast in September 1994. For a three-year period in the early days of the station the Rinse studio was hosted in DJ Slimzee's house. In its early years the station mainly played &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20music\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; with a particular focus on &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20ceremonies%23In%20music%20and%20cultural%20events\"&gt;MCs&lt;/a&gt;, a direction which set Rinse apart from competing stations. At the time the station broadcast from secret, makeshift locations such as kitchens and bedrooms belonging to friends and DJs, constantly moving between these locations to avoid getting shut down by authorities. Its first broadcast was made from Ingram House in &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Hamlets\"&gt;Tower Hamlets&lt;/a&gt;, London. This continued to a lesser extent throughout the 16 years during which Rinse was a pirate radio station.\n&lt;a href=\"Kool%20FM\"&gt;Kool FM&lt;/a&gt; was the leading pirate radio station within the jungle scene, and it wasn't until Rinse changed its focus to the emerging &lt;a href=\"UK%20garage%23history\"&gt;garage scene&lt;/a&gt; around 1998\u20131999 that it gained a substantial following, thanks to the darker sound that it brought from its jungle days. Into the early 2000s, the station became critical for emergence and development of the genres &lt;a href=\"Grime%20%28music%29\"&gt;grime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dubstep\"&gt;dubstep&lt;/a&gt;., and was managed during this time by DJ Uncle Dugs. Rinse broadcast on the frequency of 100.3/100.4FM for the majority of its unlicensed years on air.\nRadio 1 DJ &lt;a href=\"John%20Peel\"&gt;John Peel&lt;/a&gt; recommended the station in 2004, stating that:\nIn April 2005 &lt;a href=\"Ofcom\"&gt;Ofcom&lt;/a&gt; disconnected a Rinse FM radio transmitter and Dean Fullman, known on air as &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Slimzee\"&gt;DJ Slimzee&lt;/a&gt;, received an &lt;a href=\"Anti-social%20behaviour%20order\"&gt;ASBO&lt;/a&gt;, believed to be the first of its kind, banning him from every rooftop in the borough of &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Tower%20Hamlets\"&gt;Tower Hamlets&lt;/a&gt;.\nFM licence.\nAs of August 2007 the station was seeking a legal FM licence. Rinse FM created a petition which received hundreds of supporters within less than a week, including some from countries other than the UK. At the time, the station's owner DJ Geeneus said: \"We don't want to be legal to play stupid adverts and make loads of money from advertising. We want to be legal to say: look at our scene, look at what we're doing. We're a business, we're not criminals. We're supplying something that no one else is supplying, and we're professional.\"\nRinse FM was awarded a community FM broadcast licence by Ofcom in June 2010 for frequency 106.8 FM. It commenced broadcasting legally on 7 February 2011. The station is presently managed by Sarah Lockhart.\nAs part of its community broadcasting remit, Rinse FM is engaged in training young people in broadcasting skills who are considered marginalised, even working with children who are in &lt;a href=\"Pupil%20Referral%20Unit\"&gt;Pupil Referral Unit&lt;/a&gt;s. These are units for persistent truants and people with &lt;a href=\"Special%20education%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;special educational needs&lt;/a&gt;.\nDJs and presenters.\nDJs and presenters to have appeared on Rinse include:\nRinse Recordings.\nThe station first released music under the Rinse Recordings imprint in 2003. Currently, the label releases albums and singles from a roster of signed artists as well as &lt;a href=\"DJ%20mix\"&gt;mix&lt;/a&gt; CDs from DJs associated with the station. The label first saw chart success when &lt;a href=\"Katy%20B\"&gt;Katy B&lt;/a&gt; released \"&lt;a href=\"Katy%20on%20a%20Mission\"&gt;Katy on a Mission&lt;/a&gt;\" on the label in 2010.\nCurrently signed acts include &lt;a href=\"P%20Money\"&gt;P Money&lt;/a&gt;, Katy B, &lt;a href=\"Novelist%20%28MC%29\"&gt;Novelist&lt;/a&gt;, Roska and &lt;a href=\"Royal-T\"&gt;Royal-T&lt;/a&gt;. DJs who have released mix albums for Rinse Recordings include &lt;a href=\"Skream\"&gt;Skream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skepta\"&gt;Skepta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kode9\"&gt;Kode9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Butterz\"&gt;Elijah and Skilliam&lt;/a&gt;. With the release of the 23rd mix CD (mixed by Richy Ahmed), Rinse has stated that it broadens the concept to include non-residents of the station. The label went on to release Katy B's chart-topping album \"&lt;a href=\"Little%20Red%20%28album%29\"&gt;Little Red&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Route%2094%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Route 94&lt;/a&gt;'s chart-topping single \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Love%20%28Route%2094%20song%29\"&gt;My Love&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2014.\nInternet radio.\nRinse began streaming its shows online in 2006. All shows are available both on the website and &lt;a href=\"SoundCloud\"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;.\nRinse has maintained a station on &lt;a href=\"Dash%20Radio\"&gt;Dash Radio&lt;/a&gt; since 2016.\nRinse France.\nIn February 2014, Rinse launched Rinse France based in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nThe station has been described as London's biggest pirate radio station and \"without doubt the world's leading grime station.\" Writing for \"&lt;a href=\"FACT%20%28United%20Kingdom%20magazine%29\"&gt;FACT&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine in 2007, Simon Hampson stated: \"Without Rinse, Grime and Dubstep would be very different: indeed, it\u2019s fair to say that they might not even exist at all.\"\nRinse celebrated its 20th birthday in 2014."
