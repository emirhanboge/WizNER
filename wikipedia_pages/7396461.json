    "text": "Muncaster Fell is a &lt;a href=\"fell\"&gt;fell&lt;/a&gt; at the far western edge of the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District\"&gt;Lake District&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"National%20parks%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;National Park&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Cumbria\"&gt;Cumbria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. Muncaster Fell is a long, narrow ridge of land, approximately 1.2\u00a0km wide and 6\u00a0km long, lying between the &lt;a href=\"River%20Mite\"&gt;River Mite&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and &lt;a href=\"River%20Esk%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;River Esk&lt;/a&gt; to the south. The fell rises from the coast near &lt;a href=\"Ravenglass\"&gt;Ravenglass&lt;/a&gt; village to its highest point at Hooker Crag (231\u00a0m). The ridge then continues to the north-east, dropping gently to its furthest prominence at \"Silver Knott\" (174\u00a0m). The fell then falls away rapidly to the village of &lt;a href=\"Eskdale%20Green\"&gt;Eskdale Green&lt;/a&gt; at its north-eastern tip.\nLandscape.\nThe fell forms a long, low, yet steep-sided ridge that separates the southern portions of the valleys of &lt;a href=\"Miterdale\"&gt;Miterdale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eskdale%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Eskdale&lt;/a&gt;. The north-western slopes of the fell are characterised by steep &lt;a href=\"Cliff\"&gt;crags&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"scree\"&gt;scree&lt;/a&gt; slopes, which drop abruptly to the &lt;a href=\"fluvial\"&gt;fluvial&lt;/a&gt; floor of the Mite valley. The narrow-gauge &lt;a href=\"Ravenglass%20and%20Eskdale%20Railway\"&gt;Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway&lt;/a&gt; tracks cling to the lower sides of this rocky face. The south-eastern, Eskdale slopes are not much less steep, but are shallow enough to allow the cultivation of a number of forestry plantations. Woodland abounds at the southernmost tip of the fell, with natural &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt; woodland and invasive &lt;a href=\"rhododendron\"&gt;rhododendron&lt;/a&gt; stands competing for space. On the very south-western point of the fell stands &lt;a href=\"Muncaster%20Castle\"&gt;Muncaster Castle&lt;/a&gt;, its grounds planted with a wide variety of plant species, including a dense copse of &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the fell top the vegetation and landscape typifies the Cumbrian fell. A small &lt;a href=\"tarn%20%28lake%29\"&gt;tarn&lt;/a&gt;, \"Muncaster Tarn\" (GR: SD107978), sits amongst woodland on the slopes below the top of \"Hooker Crag\". Much of the area between the crags and bogs is covered by &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gorse\"&gt;gorse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyperaceae\"&gt;sedge&lt;/a&gt; and small clumps of &lt;a href=\"bilberry\"&gt;bilberry&lt;/a&gt; bushes. In recent times, in common with much of the Lake District upland area, &lt;a href=\"bracken\"&gt;bracken&lt;/a&gt; has begun to take over, possibly due to a reduction in the number of sheep grazing on upland pasture.\nAlong the southern end of the fell ridge runs a straight track, climbing up past the tarn toward \"Hooker Crag\". This is part of a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20road\"&gt;Roman road&lt;/a&gt; which used to connect the large fort of &lt;a href=\"Glannaventa\"&gt;Glannaventa&lt;/a&gt; near Ravenglass on the coast, approximately 2\u00a0km away, to the garrison at &lt;a href=\"Hardknott%20Roman%20Fort\"&gt;Hardknott Fort&lt;/a&gt; (known to the Romans as \"Mediobogdum\") 14\u00a0km to the north-east, although the rest of the route along the ridge top has been lost. There is a small, low &lt;a href=\"dolmen\"&gt;dolmen&lt;/a&gt;, which despite its stone age appearance is inscribed \"Ross's Camp 1883\" on the top surface (GR: SD121987) and was apparently built by a shooting party of that date as a luncheon table.\nViews.\nMuncaster Fell is the subject of a chapter of &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Wainwright\"&gt;Alfred Wainwright&lt;/a&gt;'s walking guide book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Outlying%20Fells%20of%20Lakeland\"&gt;The Outlying Fells of Lakeland&lt;/a&gt;\". He recommended a clockwise circuit starting from Muncaster Castle, following the ridge to Muncaster Head so as to enjoy the vista of the high fells ahead, and returning along the lane south of the fell. Wainwright commented that \"The supreme joy of Muncaster Fell is the delectable traverse of its ridge ... Here is enchantment.\"\nIt is classed as a &lt;a href=\"Fellranger%20%28hill%29\"&gt;Fellranger&lt;/a&gt;, being described by Richards in the \"Coniston\" volume of his book series. It is among the 21 such summits (originally 18 before the extension of the Lake District) which are not included in &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Wainwright\"&gt;Wainwright&lt;/a&gt;'s main &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Wainwrights\"&gt;list of 214&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Database%20of%20British%20and%20Irish%20Hills\"&gt;Database of British and Irish Hills&lt;/a&gt; recognises two distinct summits: \"Muncaster Fell\" (listed as a &lt;a href=\"Marilyn%20%28hill%29\"&gt;Marilyn&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"HuMP\"&gt;HuMP&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Tump%20%28hill%29\"&gt;Tump&lt;/a&gt;) of at and \"Muncaster Fell - Hooker Crag\" (listed as a Tump, &lt;a href=\"The%20Outlying%20Fells%20of%20Lakeland\"&gt;Wainwright Outlying Fell&lt;/a&gt;, Fellranger and &lt;a href=\"Clem%20%28hill%29\"&gt;Clem&lt;/a&gt;) of at .\nBeing relatively isolated and situated on the coast, views from the fell top include both the mountains of central Cumbria to the northeast, and the coastal plain to the northwest and south. On a clear day, the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/a&gt; can be seen across the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Sea\"&gt;Irish Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the west. For the latter part of the 20th century the view to the northwest was dominated by the twin chimneys of the &lt;a href=\"Windscale%20Piles\"&gt;Windscale Piles&lt;/a&gt; nuclear reactors. However, these landmarks were dismantled in the early years of the new millennium, and with the gradual removal of other chimneys and cooling towers associated with the power station, the &lt;a href=\"Sellafield\"&gt;Sellafield&lt;/a&gt; site is now far less imposing. Modern electricity generation technology is very evident, however, as the white turbines of the &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;Walney Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt;s are clearly visible in the Irish Sea to the southwest.\nGeology.\nMuncaster Fell is composed almost entirely of &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"microgranite\"&gt;microgranite&lt;/a&gt;, belonging to the Late &lt;a href=\"Ordovician\"&gt;Ordovician&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eskdale%20Intrusions\"&gt;Eskdale Intrusions&lt;/a&gt;. At the south-western end of the fell, between Ravenglass village and &lt;a href=\"Muncaster%20Castle\"&gt;Muncaster Castle&lt;/a&gt;, is a restricted outcrop of &lt;a href=\"hornfels\"&gt;hornfels&lt;/a&gt;ed lower Ordovician &lt;a href=\"siltstone\"&gt;siltstone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;s, belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Skiddaw%20Group\"&gt;Skiddaw Group&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Borrowdale%20Volcanic%20Group\"&gt;Borrowdale Volcanic Group&lt;/a&gt;.\nOwing to its relatively steep-sided profile the fell is largely free of &lt;a href=\"Drift%20%28geology%29\"&gt;drift geology&lt;/a&gt;. The lowest slopes are generally covered in &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diamicton\"&gt;diamicton&lt;/a&gt; derived from the &lt;a href=\"igneous\"&gt;igneous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lithology\"&gt;lithologies&lt;/a&gt; nearer the centre of the Lake District, and the steeper crags give rise to localised &lt;a href=\"scree\"&gt;scree&lt;/a&gt; deposits. Between the crags along the top of the ridge small &lt;a href=\"peat\"&gt;peat&lt;/a&gt; bogs are developed, the largest of these being \"Hooker Moss\" (GR: SD113984)."
