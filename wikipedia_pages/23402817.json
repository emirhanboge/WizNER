He was a member of the radio group &lt;a href=\"Skylark%20B\"&gt;Skylark B&lt;/a&gt; during the war. After the war he was a professor at the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Norwegian Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld War II.\nS\u00f8rbye attended secondary school at &lt;a href=\"Stabekk\"&gt;Stabekk&lt;/a&gt;, and enrolled at the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Norwegian Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; on 1 September 1939 \u2014 the day &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; began. In April 1940, the war reached Norway, with &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung\"&gt;invading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"occupation%20of%20Norway%20by%20Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;occupying the country&lt;/a&gt;. S\u00f8rbye participated in the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Campaign\"&gt;Norwegian Campaign&lt;/a&gt; as a telegrapher, but the Norwegian forces in &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%B8ndelag\"&gt;Tr\u00f8ndelag&lt;/a&gt; capitulated by 10 May 1940.\nIn September 1940, the British &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Intelligence%20Service\"&gt;Secret Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt; established two stations for radio communication in occupied Norway; the so-called &lt;a href=\"Skylark%20A\"&gt;Skylark A&lt;/a&gt; was led by &lt;a href=\"Sverre%20Midtskau\"&gt;Sverre Midtskau&lt;/a&gt; in Oslo while &lt;a href=\"Skylark%20B\"&gt;Skylark B&lt;/a&gt; was led by &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Welle-Strand\"&gt;Erik Welle-Strand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Trondheim\"&gt;Trondheim&lt;/a&gt;. As students formed the backbone of the Skylark B group, S\u00f8rbye joined. Other members were &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B8rn%20R%C3%B8rholt\"&gt;Bj\u00f8rn R\u00f8rholt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Einar%20Johansen\"&gt;Einar Johansen&lt;/a&gt;. Chemistry professor &lt;a href=\"Leif%20Tronstad\"&gt;Leif Tronstad&lt;/a&gt; also helped as well. &lt;a href=\"Egil%20Reksten\"&gt;Egil Reksten&lt;/a&gt; later took over as leader. Skylark B established regular contact with the intelligence in London in 1941 and helped provide information on German troop and naval movements, as well as vital information about &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; activity at the &lt;a href=\"Vemork\"&gt;Vemork&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heavy%20water\"&gt;heavy water&lt;/a&gt; plant.\nIn September 1941, however, &lt;a href=\"Gestapo\"&gt;Gestapo&lt;/a&gt; managed to track the Skylark B transmitting activity. S\u00f8rbye was arrested by the Nazi authorities, and was first held in &lt;a href=\"Vollan%20prison\"&gt;Vollan prison&lt;/a&gt;. He was then incarcerated at &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B8llergata%2019\"&gt;M\u00f8llergata 19&lt;/a&gt; from 27 September 1941 to 16 January 1943, and then at &lt;a href=\"Grini%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;Grini concentration camp&lt;/a&gt; until 29 July 1943. He was then shipped to Germany and the &lt;a href=\"Nacht%20und%20Nebel\"&gt;Nacht und Nebel&lt;/a&gt; camps. He spent much time in &lt;a href=\"Natzweiler-Struthof\"&gt;Natzweiler&lt;/a&gt;. Despite health problems, he survived until the end of World War II, and was brought home with the &lt;a href=\"White%20Buses\"&gt;White Buses&lt;/a&gt;. Reksten survived as well, but seven of the eleven detainees associated with Skylark died. S\u00f8rbye was decorated with the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Medal%20for%20Courage%20in%20the%20Cause%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Defence%20Medal%201940%E2%80%931945\"&gt;Defence Medal 1940\u20131945&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-war life.\nS\u00f8rbye resumed his studies, and finally graduated from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1948. He was hired by the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Defence%20Research%20Establishment\"&gt;Norwegian Defence Research Establishment&lt;/a&gt;, and stationed at their radar in Bergen.
