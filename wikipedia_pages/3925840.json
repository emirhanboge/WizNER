    "text": "Richardson High School (RHS) is a &lt;a href=\"Magnet%20school\"&gt;magnet high school&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Richardson%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Richardson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; with approximately 2,770 students and a student/teacher ratio of approximately 15:1 in the 20182019 school year. It is the oldest high school in the &lt;a href=\"Richardson%20Independent%20School%20District\"&gt;Richardson Independent School District&lt;/a&gt; (RISD).\nBackground.\nRichardson High School is the flagship high school of the &lt;a href=\"Richardson%20Independent%20School%20District\"&gt;Richardson Independent School District&lt;/a&gt; (RISD). The school has many &lt;a href=\"Magnet%20school\"&gt;magnet programs&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"culinary%20arts\"&gt;culinary arts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"theatre\"&gt;theater&lt;/a&gt;, visual arts, tech theater, &lt;a href=\"Communication%20studies\"&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"robotics\"&gt;robotics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//sites.google.com/a/g.risd.org/rhscompsci/\"&gt;computer science&lt;/a&gt;. The school also has award-winning mock trial, debate, and computer science teams. Richardson's sports mascot is the Eagle; students, teachers, and alumni are referred to as Eagles; and the team shares Eagle-Mustang Stadium (capacity 12,000) with &lt;a href=\"J.%20J.%20Pearce%20High%20School\"&gt;J. J. Pearce High School&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe school, which opened shortly after the first public school in the city was burned down by Ross Inman in 1890, began in a two-room building on Old Pike Road, a street that is now part of Greenville Avenue. A rural school with fewer than 100 students up to 1950, the school opened its present facility in 1961. During the period of the late 1950s, RHS shared facilities with Westwood Junior High School on Abrams Road. Bill Passmore was principal during this transition into the new facility on Belt Line Road.\nIn August 2006, Richardson High School was named one of three \"best practices\" high schools in the state of Texas. The award granted by the National Council of Educational Accountability and the Just 4 Kids Foundation is based upon staff development, staff retention, standardized test scores and support programs for students.\nIn May 2007, the RISD was awarded the \"Excellence in Education Award for Large School District in Texas\" by the HEB Foundation. Richardson High School and Richardson West Junior High played instrumental roles in the selection process and hosted the site visit committee in March 2007. In addition to the award, the RISD received a check for $100,000.\nIn 2009, the school's student news team started a public, student written, magazine known as \"The Talon\".\nIn the 2012 \"&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report\"&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;\" rankings of the Best Schools in America, Richardson High School ranked number 711 out of 21,766 public high schools, putting it in the top 3.5% of all public high schools in the United States. RHS was also rated the 65th best in the state of Texas.\nIn 2015, 2016, and 2017, Richardson High School was one of the few hundred schools in the state of Texas, and the only high school in &lt;a href=\"Richardson%20Independent%20School%20District\"&gt;RISD&lt;/a&gt; to earn all 7 distinctions in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Texas%20Assessments%20of%20Academic%20Readiness\"&gt;STAAR state assessment&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of the 2018\u20132019 school year, the administration at RHS is led by Chris Choat, Principal; Michelle King, Associate Principal; Bill Parker, Magnet Principal; Von Ensley, Assistant Principal; Ramiro Lucio, Assistant Principal; Elise Curry, Assistant Principal; Jose Vega, Assistant Principal; and Tara McLennan, Assistant Principal.\nJeremy Wade Delle suicide.\nOn January 8, 1991, Jeremy Wade Delle, a 15-year-old sophomore, fatally shot himself in front of his second-period English class. The incident inspired the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Jam\"&gt;Pearl Jam&lt;/a&gt; song \"&lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20%28song%29\"&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;\".\nKRET-TV.\nIn 1960 the Richardson Independent School District established KRET, the first TV station in the nation to be owned by a school district. The studio was located at Richardson High from 1963\u20131970. The studio was previously located at Richardson Junior High School (1960\u20131963). The station was converted on August 31, 1970, into a closed-circuit network named \"TAGER\"."
