    "title": "Geology of England",
    "text": "The geology of England is mainly &lt;a href=\"sedimentary%20rock\"&gt;sedimentary&lt;/a&gt;. The youngest rocks are in the south east around &lt;a href=\"Geology%20of%20London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, progressing in age in a north westerly direction. The &lt;a href=\"Tees-Exe%20line\"&gt;Tees-Exe line&lt;/a&gt; marks the division between younger, softer and low-lying rocks in the south east and the generally older and harder rocks of the north and west which give rise to higher relief in those regions. The &lt;a href=\"geology\"&gt;geology&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; is recognisable in the landscape of its &lt;a href=\"counties%20of%20England\"&gt;counties&lt;/a&gt;, the building materials of its towns and its regional &lt;a href=\"quarrying\"&gt;extractive industries&lt;/a&gt;.\nBedrock.\nThe &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; consists of many layers formed over vast periods of time. These were laid down in various &lt;a href=\"climate\"&gt;climate&lt;/a&gt;s as the global climate changed, the landmasses moved due to &lt;a href=\"continental%20drift\"&gt;continental drift&lt;/a&gt;, and the land and sea levels rose or fell. From time to time horizontal forces caused the rock to undergo considerable &lt;a href=\"Deformation%20%28geology%29\"&gt;deformation&lt;/a&gt;, folding the layers of rock to form mountains which have since been &lt;a href=\"erosion\"&gt;eroded&lt;/a&gt; and overlain with other layers. To further complicate the geology, the land has also been subject to periods of &lt;a href=\"earthquake\"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Volcanism\"&gt;volcanic&lt;/a&gt; activity.\nSuperficial deposits.\nOverlain on this bedrock or \"solid\" geology is a somewhat variable distribution of soils and fragmental material deposited by glaciers (&lt;a href=\"boulder%20clay\"&gt;boulder clay&lt;/a&gt;, and other forms of &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20landforms%23Depositional%20landforms\"&gt;glacial drift&lt;/a&gt; in the geologically recent past. \"Drift\" geology is often more important than \"solid\" geology when considering building works, drainage, siting water boreholes, soil fertility, and many other issues.\n&lt;a href=\"Glaciation\"&gt;Glaciation&lt;/a&gt; and the resulting &lt;a href=\"glacial%20deposition\"&gt;glacial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fluvio-glacial%20deposition\"&gt;fluvio-glacial deposition&lt;/a&gt; has had a major impact on the landscape of England covering many areas with a veneer of glacial till in the lower lying areas north of a line running from &lt;a href=\"Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; to London. In the &lt;a href=\"River%20Ribble\"&gt;Ribble&lt;/a&gt; valley, &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; in north west England the resulting &lt;a href=\"drumlins\"&gt;drumlins&lt;/a&gt; are clearly visible. &lt;a href=\"Cromer%20Ridge\"&gt;Cromer Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Anglia\"&gt;East Anglia&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"terminal%20moraine\"&gt;terminal moraine&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, most of East Anglia is covered with &lt;a href=\"glacial%20till\"&gt;glacial till&lt;/a&gt; which has produced its rich &lt;a href=\"loam\"&gt;loam&lt;/a&gt;y soils. This unconsolidated material (it is not stuck tightly together) is very easily eroded hence the rapid rate of retreat of the coastline of this region.\nA similar situation exists in east &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Holderness\"&gt;Holderness&lt;/a&gt; district. The chalk outcrop at &lt;a href=\"Flamborough%20Head\"&gt;Flamborough Head&lt;/a&gt; in the north produces a headland relatively resistant to coastal erosion whilst the coastline south of this at such places as &lt;a href=\"Mappleton\"&gt;Mappleton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hornsea\"&gt;Hornsea&lt;/a&gt; with their soft glacial deposits are vulnerable.\nFormer ice caps did not reach south of the line running from Bristol to London, so this area has only been impacted by fluvio-glacial deposition which is represented in gravel beds around rivers such as the &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;Thames&lt;/a&gt;. As the ice caps retreated northwards, more fluvio-glacial deposition occurred for example in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20York\"&gt;Vale of York&lt;/a&gt;\nGeological history.\nPrecambrian supereon.\nNo rocks earlier than the Proterozoic occur at surface within England.\nProterozoic eon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Proterozoic\"&gt;Proterozoic&lt;/a&gt; lasted from (2,500\u2013541 &lt;a href=\"annum\"&gt;Ma&lt;/a&gt;). The early geological development of the &lt;a href=\"Avalonia\"&gt;Avalonia terrane&lt;/a&gt;, including England, is believed to have been in &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20arc\"&gt;volcanic arc&lt;/a&gt;s near a &lt;a href=\"subduction%20zone\"&gt;subduction zone&lt;/a&gt; on the margin of the &lt;a href=\"Gondwana\"&gt;Gondwana&lt;/a&gt; continent. Some material may have accreted from volcanic island arcs which formed further out in the ocean and later collided with Gondwana as a result of &lt;a href=\"plate%20tectonics\"&gt;plate tectonic&lt;/a&gt; movements. The igneous activity had started by 730 million years ago and continued until around 570 million years ago, resulting in a region of volcanic islands within a shallow sea. The remains of these islands underlie much of central England with small outcrops visible in various places.\nAround 600 million years ago, the &lt;a href=\"Cadomian%20Orogeny\"&gt;Cadomian Orogeny&lt;/a&gt; (mountain building period) created mountains in what would subsequently become England, along with much of north west &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhanerozoic eon.\nThe Phanerozoic comprises the Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, each of which are represented in English geology.\nPalaeozoic era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Palaeozoic\"&gt;Palaeozoic&lt;/a&gt; comprises six periods from the Cambrian to the Permian (541\u2013252 Ma).\nCambrian period.\nIn the early &lt;a href=\"Cambrian\"&gt;Cambrian&lt;/a&gt; period the &lt;a href=\"volcano\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;s of England were eroded as the land became flooded by a rise in sea level, and new layers of sediment were laid down. Cambrian shales laid down in a shallow sea are exposed in the Midlands at &lt;a href=\"Nuneaton\"&gt;Nuneaton&lt;/a&gt;. Much of central England formed a stable block of crust which has remained largely undeformed ever since.\nOrdovician period.\nFive hundred million years ago, in the &lt;a href=\"Ordovician\"&gt;Ordovician&lt;/a&gt; period, southern Britain, the east coast of &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; and south-east &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20%28island%29\"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt; broke away from &lt;a href=\"Gondwanaland\"&gt;Gondwanaland&lt;/a&gt; to form the continent of &lt;a href=\"Avalonia\"&gt;Avalonia&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Skiddaw%20slate\"&gt;Skiddaw slate&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District\"&gt;Lake District&lt;/a&gt; consist of metamorphosed marine sediments laid down on the northern margin of Avalonia.\nLarge quantities of volcanic &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and ash known as the &lt;a href=\"Borrowdale%20Volcanics\"&gt;Borrowdale Volcanics&lt;/a&gt; covered the Lake District, still seen in the form of mountains such as &lt;a href=\"Helvellyn\"&gt;Helvellyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scafell%20Pike\"&gt;Scafell Pike&lt;/a&gt;.\nSilurian period.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Silurian\"&gt;Silurian&lt;/a&gt; period, &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mudstone\"&gt;mudstone&lt;/a&gt;s were deposited in some parts of England. Volcanic ashes and lavas deposited during the period are still found in the &lt;a href=\"Mendip%20Hills\"&gt;Mendip Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nAvalonia had now joined with the continent of &lt;a href=\"Baltica\"&gt;Baltica&lt;/a&gt;, and the combined landmass collided with &lt;a href=\"Laurentia\"&gt;Laurentia&lt;/a&gt; around 425 million years ago, joining the southern and northern halves of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Isles\"&gt;British Isles&lt;/a&gt; together. The resulting &lt;a href=\"Caledonian%20Orogeny\"&gt;Caledonian Orogeny&lt;/a&gt; produced an &lt;a href=\"Alps\"&gt;Alpine&lt;/a&gt;-style mountain range. England lay on the southern fringe of this range.\nDevonian period.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Devonian\"&gt;Devonian&lt;/a&gt; period, northern England was a region uplifted by the Caledonian Orogeny. The uplifted regions were gradually eroded down, resulting in the deposition of numerous sedimentary rock layers in lowlands and seas. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Red%20Sandstone\"&gt;Old Red Sandstone&lt;/a&gt; was deposited across much of central and southern England. Sea levels varied considerably at this time with the coastline advancing and retreating from north to south across England. The Old Red Sandstone of &lt;a href=\"Devon\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; gave the period its name.\nCarboniferous period.\nAround 360 million years ago during the &lt;a href=\"Carboniferous\"&gt;Carboniferous&lt;/a&gt; period, England was lying at the equator, covered by the warm shallow waters of the &lt;a href=\"Rheic%20Ocean\"&gt;Rheic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. During this time Carboniferous Limestone was deposited, as found in the &lt;a href=\"Mendip%20Hills\"&gt;Mendip Hills&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Peak%20District\"&gt;Peak District&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Derbyshire\"&gt;Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;, north &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; and the northern &lt;a href=\"Pennines\"&gt;Pennines&lt;/a&gt;. The erosion of this landscape by &lt;a href=\"carbonation\"&gt;carbonation&lt;/a&gt; has led to very distinctive scenery. Particularly notable is the area around &lt;a href=\"Malham\"&gt;Malham&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Dales\"&gt;Yorkshire Dales&lt;/a&gt; with its &lt;a href=\"limestone%20pavement\"&gt;limestone pavement&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sink%20holes\"&gt;sink holes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shake%20hole\"&gt;shake hole&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Gaping%20Gill\"&gt;Gaping Gill&lt;/a&gt; contains a waterfall disappearing underground into the Carboniferous limestone.\nThe formation of Carboniferous Limestone was followed by the deposition of dark marine &lt;a href=\"shale\"&gt;shale&lt;/a&gt;s, siltstones and coarse sandstones of the &lt;a href=\"Millstone%20Grit\"&gt;Millstone Grit&lt;/a&gt;, notably in the area later uplifted to form the Pennine &lt;a href=\"anticline\"&gt;anticline&lt;/a&gt;. This sequence can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Dales\"&gt;Yorkshire Dales&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Ingleborough\"&gt;Ingleborough&lt;/a&gt; protruding up above the Carboniferous Limestone landscape below.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"river%20delta\"&gt;river delta&lt;/a&gt;s formed and the sediments deposited were colonised by &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"rain%20forest\"&gt;rain forest&lt;/a&gt;. It was in this environment that the &lt;a href=\"cyclic%20sediments\"&gt;cyclic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"coal%20measures\"&gt;coal measures&lt;/a&gt; were formed. &lt;a href=\"Coal\"&gt;Coal&lt;/a&gt; can be found as far south as &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; with deposits stretching northwards to &lt;a href=\"Tyne%20and%20Wear\"&gt;Tyne and Wear&lt;/a&gt;; though coal has largely been mined in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Midlands\"&gt;Midlands&lt;/a&gt; and northern England. One of the best exposures of the &lt;a href=\"Coal%20Measures\"&gt;Coal Measures&lt;/a&gt; is on the north east coast between &lt;a href=\"Whitley%20Bay\"&gt;Whitley Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seaton%20Sluice\"&gt;Seaton Sluice&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariscan Orogeny.\nAround 280 million years ago, at the close of the Carboniferous period, the &lt;a href=\"Variscan%20orogeny\"&gt;Variscan orogeny&lt;/a&gt; (mountain building period) caused major deformation in south west England. The general region of Variscan folding was south of an east\u2013west line roughly from &lt;a href=\"Avon%20%28county%29\"&gt;Avon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;, though lesser folding took place as far north as Derbyshire and &lt;a href=\"Berwick-upon-Tweed\"&gt;Berwick-upon-Tweed&lt;/a&gt;. The main tectonic pressure was from the south or south-west.\nTowards the end of the orogeny the emplacement of a &lt;a href=\"Cornubian%20batholith\"&gt;large batholith&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt; occurred below what is now &lt;a href=\"Devon\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cornwall\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;. This granite is now exposed as &lt;a href=\"Dartmoor\"&gt;Dartmoor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bodmin%20Moor\"&gt;Bodmin Moor&lt;/a&gt; and several other exposures in Cornwall, including the &lt;a href=\"Isles%20of%20Scilly\"&gt;Isles of Scilly&lt;/a&gt;. Granite &lt;a href=\"Tor%20%28rock%20formation%29\"&gt;tors&lt;/a&gt; form important elements in the landscape in these areas. Metamorphism of the &lt;a href=\"country%20rock%20%28geology%29\"&gt;country rocks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hydrothermal%20circulation\"&gt;hydrothermal circulation&lt;/a&gt; of metal-rich fluids in the cooling rock provided the source of the extensive &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Ametalliferous\"&gt;metalliferous&lt;/a&gt; deposits of the region (primarily copper and tin). Later &lt;a href=\"weathering\"&gt;weathering&lt;/a&gt; of the granite led to deposits of &lt;a href=\"kaolin\"&gt;kaolin&lt;/a&gt; which has been excavated as it is an important source of &lt;a href=\"china%20clay\"&gt;china clay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ball%20clay\"&gt;ball clay&lt;/a&gt; used in the production of such products as &lt;a href=\"porcelain\"&gt;porcelain&lt;/a&gt; and shiny printing paper.\nBy the end of the period, England had a hot arid &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; climate, with frequent flash floods leaving deposits that formed red beds, somewhat similar to the later, &lt;a href=\"Triassic\"&gt;Triassic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"New%20Red%20Sandstone\"&gt;New Red Sandstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the end of the Carboniferous period, an intrusion of &lt;a href=\"quartz%20dolerite\"&gt;quartz dolerite&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"Whin%20Sill\"&gt;Whin Sill&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"River%20Tees\"&gt;River Tees&lt;/a&gt; flows over this at &lt;a href=\"High%20Force\"&gt;High Force&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Alston%20Block\"&gt;Alston Block&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Whin%20Sill\"&gt;Whin Sill&lt;/a&gt; is also seen again at &lt;a href=\"Hadrian%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Hadrian's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. The country rock is Lower Carboniferous limestone and shales.\nPermian period.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Permian\"&gt;Permian&lt;/a&gt; period was characterised for 30 million years by arid desert and erosion of the areas uplifted in the &lt;a href=\"Variscan%20Orogeny\"&gt;Variscan Orogeny&lt;/a&gt; (southwest England and adjacent areas in the present-day English Channel). Later, much of England was submerged in shallow waters as the polar ice sheets melted and the &lt;a href=\"Tethys%20Ocean\"&gt;Tethys Ocean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zechstein%20Sea\"&gt;Zechstein Sea&lt;/a&gt; formed, depositing &lt;a href=\"shale\"&gt;shale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"marl\"&gt;marl&lt;/a&gt;, before finally receding to leave a flat desert with &lt;a href=\"Dry%20lake\"&gt;salt pan&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMesozoic era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mesozoic\"&gt;Mesozoic&lt;/a&gt; comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods (252\u201366 Ma).\nTriassic period.\nAs Pangaea drifted during the &lt;a href=\"Triassic\"&gt;Triassic&lt;/a&gt; period, England moved away from the equator until it was between 20\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 north. Red beds, including sandstones and red mudstones form the main sediments of the New Red Sandstone. The remnants of the Variscan uplands in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; to the south were eroded down, resulting in layers of the New Red Sandstone being deposited across central England, and in &lt;a href=\"Fault%20%28geology%29\"&gt;faulted&lt;/a&gt; basins in &lt;a href=\"Cheshire\"&gt;Cheshire&lt;/a&gt;. A basin developed in the &lt;a href=\"Hampshire\"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; region around this time. &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;ing occurred within and around England, prior to the breakup of the super-continent in the Jurassic period.\nRock fragments found near Bristol appear to indicate that in 214 million years ago England was showered with a fine layer of debris from an &lt;a href=\"impact%20event\"&gt;asteroid impact&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Manicouagan%20Impact%20Crater\"&gt;Manicouagan Impact Crater&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; (when both areas were parts of the Pangaea supercontinent), although this is still being debated.\nJurassic period.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Jurassic\"&gt;Jurassic&lt;/a&gt; period started, &lt;a href=\"Pangaea\"&gt;Pangaea&lt;/a&gt; began to break up and sea levels rose, as England drifted on the &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20Plate\"&gt;Eurasian Plate&lt;/a&gt; to between 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 north. With much of England under water again, &lt;a href=\"sedimentary%20rock\"&gt;sedimentary rock&lt;/a&gt;s were deposited and can now be found underlying much of southern England from the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Hills\"&gt;Cleveland Hills&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Jurassic%20Coast\"&gt;Jurassic Coast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Geology%20of%20Dorset\"&gt;Dorset&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;s, sandstones, &lt;a href=\"greensand%20%28geology%29\"&gt;greensand&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"oolite\"&gt;oolitic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cotswold%20Hills\"&gt;Cotswold Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"corallian%20limestone\"&gt;corallian limestone&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20White%20Horse\"&gt;Vale of White Horse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Limestone\"&gt;Isle of Portland&lt;/a&gt;. A particularly interesting Jurassic site is on the North &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; coast between &lt;a href=\"Staithes\"&gt;Staithes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hinderwell\"&gt;Port Mulgrave&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe burial of &lt;a href=\"algae\"&gt;algae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bacterium\"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; below the mud of the sea floor during this time resulted in the formation of &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20oil\"&gt;North Sea oil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"natural%20gas\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt;, much of it trapped in overlying sandstone by &lt;a href=\"salt\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; deposits formed as the seas fell to form the swamps and salty lakes and lagoons that were home to &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCretaceous period.\nAfter 20 million years during the &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous\"&gt;Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt; period, the seas started to flood the land again until much of England was again below the sea, though sea levels frequently changed. &lt;a href=\"Chalk\"&gt;Chalk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt;s were deposited over much of England, now notably exposed at the &lt;a href=\"White%20Cliffs%20of%20Dover\"&gt;White Cliffs of Dover&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Sisters%2C%20Sussex\"&gt;Seven Sisters&lt;/a&gt;, and also forming &lt;a href=\"Salisbury%20Plain\"&gt;Salisbury Plain&lt;/a&gt;. The high sea levels left only small areas of land exposed. This caused the general lack of land-origin sand, mud or clay sediments around this time\u00a0\u2013 some of the late Cretaceous strata are almost pure chalk.\nCenozoic era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cenozoic\"&gt;Cenozoic&lt;/a&gt; comprises the &lt;a href=\"Palaeogene\"&gt;Palaeogene&lt;/a&gt;, Neogene and Quaternary periods (66 Ma\u2013present).\nPalaeogene.\nIn the early Palaeogene period between 63 and 52 million years ago, the last igneous rocks in England were formed. The granite &lt;a href=\"Lundy%20Island\"&gt;Lundy Island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Channel\"&gt;Bristol Channel&lt;/a&gt; dates from this period.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20Orogeny\"&gt;Alpine Orogeny&lt;/a&gt; that took place from about 50 million years ago was responsible for the shaping of the &lt;a href=\"London%20Basin\"&gt;London Basin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"syncline\"&gt;syncline&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Weald\"&gt;Weald&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"anticline\"&gt;anticline&lt;/a&gt; to the south. This orogeny also led to the development of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Downs\"&gt;North Downs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Downs\"&gt;South Downs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chiltern%20Hills\"&gt;Chiltern Hills&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"escarpment\"&gt;escarpment&lt;/a&gt;s, and the near-vertical folds in south &lt;a href=\"Dorset\"&gt;Dorset&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Wight\"&gt;Isle of Wight&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the period England was &lt;a href=\"Tectonic%20uplift\"&gt;uplifted&lt;/a&gt; leading to erosion and the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Sub-Paleogene%20surface\"&gt;Sub-Paleogene surface&lt;/a&gt;. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness from the &lt;a href=\"Caledonian%20Orogeny\"&gt;Caledonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Variscan%20Orogeny\"&gt;Variscan orogenies&lt;/a&gt; long before. The uplifted areas were then eroded, and further sediments were deposited over southern England, including the &lt;a href=\"London%20Clay\"&gt;London Clay&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"English%20Channel\"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt; consisted of &lt;a href=\"mud%20flat\"&gt;mud flat&lt;/a&gt;s and river deposited &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;s. Much of the Midlands and north of England may have been covered by Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits at the start of the Palaeogene, but lost them through erosion. By 35 million years ago, the landscape included &lt;a href=\"beech\"&gt;beech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cupressaceae\"&gt;redwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arecaceae\"&gt;palm&lt;/a&gt; trees, along with &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;land.\nNeogene.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Miocene\"&gt;Miocene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pliocene\"&gt;Pliocene&lt;/a&gt; epochs of the &lt;a href=\"Neogene\"&gt;Neogene&lt;/a&gt; period, further uplift and erosion occurred, particularly in the Pennines. Plant and animal types developed into their modern forms, and by about 2 million years ago the landscape would have been broadly recognisable today.\nQuaternary.\nThe major changes during the &lt;a href=\"Pleistocene\"&gt;Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt; epoch have been brought about by several recent &lt;a href=\"ice%20age\"&gt;ice age&lt;/a&gt;s. The most severe was the &lt;a href=\"Anglian%20Stage\"&gt;Anglian Stage&lt;/a&gt;, with ice up to 1,000\u00a0m (3300\u00a0ft) thick in the northwest which thinned considerably as it reached as far south as London and Bristol. This glaciation took place between about 500,000 to 400,000 years ago, and was responsible for the diversion of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt; onto its present course.\nThere is extensive evidence in the form of stone tools that southern England was colonised by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; populations during the warm &lt;a href=\"Hoxnian%20Stage\"&gt;Hoxnian Stage&lt;/a&gt; period that followed the glaciation of the Anglian Stage. It is possible that the &lt;a href=\"English%20Channel\"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly opened and closed during this period, causing Britain to become an island from time to time. The oldest human &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s in these islands also date from this time, including the skull of &lt;a href=\"Swanscombe%20Man\"&gt;Swanscombe Man&lt;/a&gt; from 250,000 years ago, and the earlier &lt;a href=\"Clactonian%20Man\"&gt;Clactonian Man&lt;/a&gt;.\nMultiple glaciations occurred during &lt;a href=\"Wolstonian%20Stage\"&gt;Wolstonian Stage&lt;/a&gt;, between about 352,000 to 132,000 years ago. Thought to have peaked around 150,000 years ago, it was named after the town of &lt;a href=\"Wolston\"&gt;Wolston&lt;/a&gt; south of &lt;a href=\"Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; which is considered to mark the southern limit of the ice.\nThe Wolstonian Stage was followed by interglacial climate of the &lt;a href=\"Eemian%20Stage\"&gt;Ipswichian Stage&lt;/a&gt;, during which &lt;a href=\"hippopotamus\"&gt;hippopotamus&lt;/a&gt; are known to have lived as far north as &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most recent glaciations occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Devensian%20glaciation\"&gt;Devensian Stage&lt;/a&gt;, which is thought to have started around 75,000 years ago, peaked around 20,000 years ago and ended a mere 11,500 years ago. The valleys of the Lake District and parts of the Pennines were further eroded by &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt;s, with the ice sheet itself reaching south to Birmingham. It is thought that the country was eventually abandoned as the ice sheet reached its peak, being recolonised as it retreated. By 5,000 years ago it is thought that the British Isles were warmer than they are at present.\nAmong the features left behind by the ice are the &lt;a href=\"Glaciated%20valley\"&gt;glaciated U-shaped valleys&lt;/a&gt; of the Lake District and &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20erratic\"&gt;erratics&lt;/a&gt; (blocks of rock) that have been transported by ice, including some from the &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; region and deposited on the coast of &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the last twelve thousand years during the &lt;a href=\"Holocene\"&gt;Holocene&lt;/a&gt; epoch the most significant new geological features have been the deposits of &lt;a href=\"peat\"&gt;peat&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in coastal areas that have recently been artificially drained such as the &lt;a href=\"Somerset%20Levels\"&gt;Somerset Levels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Fens\"&gt;The Fens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Romney%20Marsh\"&gt;Romney Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince humans began clearing the forest during the &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;New Stone Age&lt;/a&gt;, most of the land has now been deforested, speeding the natural processes of &lt;a href=\"erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt;. Large quantities of stone, gravel and clay are extracted each year, and by 2000 11% of England was covered by roads or buildings.\nAt the present time, due to Scotland's continuing to rise as a result of the weight of Devensian ice being lifted, England is sinking. This is generally estimated at 1\u00a0mm (1/25 inch) per year, with the London area sinking at double the speed partly due to the continuing compression of the recent clay deposits. A contributory factor is the draining of many stretches of land.\nIn addition, rises in sea level thought to be due to &lt;a href=\"global%20warming\"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; appear likely to make low-lying areas of land increasingly susceptible to flooding, while in some areas the coastline continues to erode at a geologically rapid rate.\nRecent flooding events leave geological evidence such as the &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Channel%20floods%2C%201607\"&gt;Bristol Channel floods&lt;/a&gt; in 1607.\nThe British Isles continue to be subject to several very minor earthquakes each month, and occasional light to moderate ones. During the 20th century 25 earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 to 6.1 on the &lt;a href=\"Richter%20magnitude%20scale\"&gt;Richter scale&lt;/a&gt; were felt, many of them originating within England itself. Notable was the &lt;a href=\"1884%20Colchester%20earthquake\"&gt;Colchester earthquake&lt;/a&gt; in 1884 and the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Dudley%20earthquake\"&gt;2002 Dudley earthquake&lt;/a&gt;.\nTectonics of Avalonia.\n&lt;a href=\"Avalonia\"&gt;Avalonia&lt;/a&gt; was an ancient &lt;a href=\"microcontinent\"&gt;microcontinent&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"terrane\"&gt;terrane&lt;/a&gt; whose history formed much of the older rocks of Western Europe. The name is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Avalon%20Peninsula\"&gt;Avalon Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20%28island%29\"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;. England was almost entirely contained within the Avalonian block, as shown in the map, and thus shares its geolocation chronology.\nIn the early &lt;a href=\"Cambrian\"&gt;Cambrian&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"supercontinent\"&gt;supercontinent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pannotia\"&gt;Pannotia&lt;/a&gt; broke up and Avalonia drifted off northwards from &lt;a href=\"Gondwana\"&gt;Gondwana&lt;/a&gt;. This independent movement of Avalonia started from a latitude of about 60\u00b0 South. The eastern end of Avalonia collided with &lt;a href=\"Baltica\"&gt;Baltica&lt;/a&gt;, a continental plate occupying the latitudes from about 30\u00b0S to 55\u00b0S, as the latter slowly rotated anticlockwise towards it. This happened at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Ordovician\"&gt;Ordovician&lt;/a&gt; and during the &lt;a href=\"Llandovery%20epoch\"&gt;Early Silurian&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the late &lt;a href=\"Silurian\"&gt;Silurian&lt;/a&gt; and lower &lt;a href=\"Devonian\"&gt;Devonian&lt;/a&gt;, the combined Baltica and Avalonia collided progressively, with &lt;a href=\"Laurentia\"&gt;Laurentia&lt;/a&gt;, beginning with the long extremity of Avalonia which is now attached to America. The result of this was the formation of &lt;a href=\"Euramerica\"&gt;Euramerica&lt;/a&gt;. At the completion of this stage, the site of Britain was at 30\u00b0S and &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; at about 45\u00b0S. This collision is represented by the &lt;a href=\"Caledonian%20orogeny\"&gt;Caledonian&lt;/a&gt; folding or in North America as an early phase in the &lt;a href=\"Acadian%20orogeny\"&gt;Acadian orogeny&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Permian\"&gt;Permian&lt;/a&gt;, the new continent and another terrane, &lt;a href=\"Armorican%20terrane\"&gt;Armorica&lt;/a&gt; which included &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20terrane\"&gt;Iberia&lt;/a&gt;, drifted in from Gondwana, trapping Avalonia between it and the continent so adding Iberia/Armorica to Euramerica. This was followed up by the arrival of Gondwana. The effects of these collisions are seen in Europe as the &lt;a href=\"Variscan%20orogeny\"&gt;Variscan&lt;/a&gt; folding. In North America it shows as later phases of the Acadian orogeny. This was happening at around the Equator during the later &lt;a href=\"Carboniferous\"&gt;Carboniferous&lt;/a&gt;, forming &lt;a href=\"Pangaea\"&gt;Pangaea&lt;/a&gt; in such a way that Avalonia was near its centre but partially flooded by shallow sea.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Jurassic\"&gt;Jurassic&lt;/a&gt;, Pangaea split into &lt;a href=\"Laurasia\"&gt;Laurasia&lt;/a&gt; and Gondwana, with Avalonia as part of Laurasia. In the &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous\"&gt;Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt;, Laurasia broke up into &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt; with Avalonia split between them."
