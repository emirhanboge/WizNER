Born in &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, he was educated at &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; schools before becoming a &lt;a href=\"coal%20miner\"&gt;coal miner&lt;/a&gt; and shipyard worker. He migrated to Australia in 1900, becoming a &lt;a href=\"boilermaker\"&gt;boilermaker&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fremantle%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Fremantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. He was a &lt;a href=\"trade%20union\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party\"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; official, and his sister married the future Labor &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Prime Minister of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Curtin\"&gt;John Curtin&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1904, Needham was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australian%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Western Australian Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; as the Labor member for &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20district%20of%20Fremantle\"&gt;Fremantle&lt;/a&gt;, serving until 1905. In 1906, he was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Senate\"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; as a Labor Senator for Western Australia. He was the only one of Western Australia's six Labor senators to remain loyal to the party after the 1916 split over &lt;a href=\"conscription\"&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt;, and he lost his seat in 1919 as a result. Re-elected in 1922, his second Senate term lasted until his defeat in 1928, taking effect in 1929. In 1933, he returned to the Legislative Assembly as the member for &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20district%20of%20Perth\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, shifting to &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20district%20of%20North%20Perth\"&gt;North Perth&lt;/a&gt; in 1950. He left the Assembly in 1953. Needham died in 1956. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving member of the 1907\u20131910 Senate."
