    "title": "Samuel Goldwyn",
    "text": "Samuel Goldwyn (born Szmuel Gelbfisz; ; August 27, 1882 January 31, 1974), also known as Samuel Goldfish, was a &lt;a href=\"Polish-American\"&gt;Polish-American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"film%20producer\"&gt;film producer&lt;/a&gt;. He was best known for being the founding contributor and &lt;a href=\"Studio%20executive\"&gt;executive&lt;/a&gt; of several &lt;a href=\"Film%20studio\"&gt;motion picture studios&lt;/a&gt; in Hollywood. His awards include the 1973 &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Globe%20Cecil%20B.%20DeMille%20Award\"&gt;Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Irving%20G.%20Thalberg%20Memorial%20Award\"&gt;Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award&lt;/a&gt; in 1947, and the &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Hersholt%20Humanitarian%20Award\"&gt;Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award&lt;/a&gt; in 1958.\nEarly life.\nGoldwyn was born Szmuel Gelbfisz in &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Jewish\"&gt;Polish Jewish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hasidic\"&gt;Hasidic&lt;/a&gt; parents, Aaron Dawid Gelbfisz (1859\u20131895), a peddler, and his wife, Hanna Frymet (\"n\u00e9e\" Fiszhaut ; 1860\u20131925).\nHe left Warsaw &lt;a href=\"Pennilessness\"&gt;penniless&lt;/a&gt; after his father's death and made his way to &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;. There he stayed with acquaintances of his family where he was trained as a &lt;a href=\"glove\"&gt;glove&lt;/a&gt; maker. On November 26, 1898, Gelbfisz left Hamburg for &lt;a href=\"Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, where he remained with relatives for six weeks under the name Samuel Goldfish. On January 4, 1899, he sailed from &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; on January 19, and went to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. He found work in &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20New%20York\"&gt;upstate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gloversville%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Gloversville, New York&lt;/a&gt; in the bustling glove business. Soon, his innate &lt;a href=\"marketing\"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; skills made him a very successful salesman at the Elite Glove Company. After four years as &lt;a href=\"Vice%20president\"&gt;vice-president&lt;/a&gt; of sales, he moved to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and settled at 10 West 61st Street.\nParamount.\nIn 1913, Goldwyn, along with his brother-in-law &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20L.%20Lasky\"&gt;Jesse L. Lasky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cecil%20B.%20DeMille\"&gt;Cecil B. DeMille&lt;/a&gt;, and Arthur Friend formed a partnership, The Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, to produce feature-length motion pictures. Film rights for a &lt;a href=\"Play%20%28theatre%29\"&gt;stage play&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Squaw%20Man%20%28play%29\"&gt;The Squaw Man&lt;/a&gt;\", were purchased for $4,000 and &lt;a href=\"Dustin%20Farnum\"&gt;Dustin Farnum&lt;/a&gt; was hired for the &lt;a href=\"Leading%20actor\"&gt;leading role&lt;/a&gt;. Shooting for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Squaw%20Man%20%281914%20film%29\"&gt;first feature film&lt;/a&gt; made in &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; began on December 29, 1913.\nIn 1914, &lt;a href=\"Paramount%20Pictures\"&gt;Paramount&lt;/a&gt; was a film exchange and &lt;a href=\"Movie%20theater\"&gt;exhibition&lt;/a&gt; corporation headed by &lt;a href=\"W.%20W.%20Hodkinson\"&gt;W. W. Hodkinson&lt;/a&gt;. Looking for more movies to distribute, Paramount signed a contract with the Lasky Company on June 1, 1914 to supply 36 films per year. One of Paramount's other suppliers was &lt;a href=\"Adolph%20Zukor\"&gt;Adolph Zukor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Famous%20Players%20Film%20Company\"&gt;Famous Players Company&lt;/a&gt;. The two companies &lt;a href=\"Mergers%20and%20acquisitions\"&gt;merged&lt;/a&gt; on June 28, 1916 forming &lt;a href=\"Famous%20Players-Lasky\"&gt;The Famous Players-Lasky Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. Zukor had been quietly buying Paramount &lt;a href=\"stock\"&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt;, and two weeks prior to the merger, became &lt;a href=\"President%20%28corporate%20title%29\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; of Paramount Pictures Corporation and had Hodkinson replaced with &lt;a href=\"Hiram%20Abrams\"&gt;Hiram Abrams&lt;/a&gt;, a Zukor associate.\nWith the merger, Zukor became president of both Paramount and Famous Players-Lasky, with Goldfish being named chairman of the board of Famous Players-Lasky, and Jesse Lasky first vice-president. After a series of conflicts with Zukor, Goldfish resigned as &lt;a href=\"Chairman\"&gt;chairman of the board&lt;/a&gt;, and as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Committee\"&gt;executive committee&lt;/a&gt; on September 14, 1916. Goldfish was no longer an active member of &lt;a href=\"management\"&gt;management&lt;/a&gt;, although he still owned stock and was a member of the board of directors. Famous Players-Lasky would later become part of Paramount Pictures Corporation, and Paramount would become one of Hollywood's major studios.\nGoldwyn Pictures.\nIn 1916, Goldfish partnered with &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20theatre\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; producers &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Selwyn\"&gt;Edgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archibald%20Selwyn\"&gt;Archibald Selwyn&lt;/a&gt;, using a combination of both names to call their film-making enterprise &lt;a href=\"Goldwyn%20Pictures\"&gt;Goldwyn Pictures&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing an opportunity, he had his &lt;a href=\"Name%20change\"&gt;name legally changed&lt;/a&gt; to Samuel Goldwyn in December 1918 and used this name for the rest of his life. Goldwyn Pictures proved successful but it is their \"&lt;a href=\"Leo%20the%20Lion%20%28MGM%29\"&gt;Leo the Lion&lt;/a&gt;\" trademark for which the company is today remembered.\nOn April 10, 1924, Goldwyn Pictures was acquired by &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Loew\"&gt;Marcus Loew&lt;/a&gt; and merged into his &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Pictures%20Corporation\"&gt;Metro Pictures Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, becoming &lt;a href=\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\"&gt;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the inclusion of his name, Samuel Goldwyn never had any connection with ownership, management or production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\nSamuel Goldwyn Productions.\nBefore the sale and merger of Goldwyn Pictures in April 1924, Goldwyn had established &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Productions\"&gt;Samuel Goldwyn Productions&lt;/a&gt; in 1923 as a &lt;a href=\"Production%20company\"&gt;production-only operation&lt;/a&gt; (with no distribution arm). Their first feature was \"&lt;a href=\"Potash%20and%20Perlmutter\"&gt;Potash and Perlmutter&lt;/a&gt;\", released in September 1923 through &lt;a href=\"First%20National%20Pictures\"&gt;First National Pictures&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the early productions bear the name \"Howard Productions\", named for Goldwyn's wife, &lt;a href=\"Frances%20Howard%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Frances&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor 35 years, Goldwyn built a reputation in &lt;a href=\"filmmaking\"&gt;filmmaking&lt;/a&gt; and developed an eye for finding the talent for making films. &lt;a href=\"William%20Wyler\"&gt;William Wyler&lt;/a&gt; directed many of his most celebrated productions, and he hired writers such as &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Hecht\"&gt;Ben Hecht&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Howard\"&gt;Sidney Howard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dorothy%20Parker\"&gt;Dorothy Parker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lillian%20Hellman\"&gt;Lillian Hellman&lt;/a&gt;. (According to legend, at a heated story conference Goldwyn scolded someone\u2014in most accounts Mrs. Parker, who recalled he had once been a glove maker\u2014who responded to him, \"Don't you point that finger at me. I knew it when it had a thimble on it!\")\nDuring that time, Goldwyn made numerous films and reigned as Hollywood's most successful &lt;a href=\"Independent%20film\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; producer. Many of his films were forgettable; his collaboration with &lt;a href=\"John%20Ford\"&gt;John Ford&lt;/a&gt;, however, resulted in a &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture\"&gt;Best Picture&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Awards\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt; nomination for \"&lt;a href=\"Arrowsmith%20%28movie%29\"&gt;Arrowsmith&lt;/a&gt;\" (1931). Goldwyn and Ford had another successful collaboration six years later with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hurricane%20%281937%20movie%29\"&gt;The Hurricane&lt;/a&gt;\" (1937). &lt;a href=\"William%20Wyler\"&gt;William Wyler&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for most of Goldwyn's highly lauded films, with Best Picture &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Awards\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt; nominations for \"&lt;a href=\"Dodsworth%20%28film%29\"&gt;Dodsworth&lt;/a&gt;\" (1936), \"&lt;a href=\"Dead%20End%20%281937%20film%29\"&gt;Dead End&lt;/a&gt;\" (1937), \"&lt;a href=\"Wuthering%20Heights%20%281939%20film%29\"&gt;Wuthering Heights&lt;/a&gt;\" (1939), \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Little%20Foxes%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Little Foxes&lt;/a&gt;\" (1941) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Best%20Years%20of%20Our%20Lives\"&gt;The Best Years of Our Lives&lt;/a&gt;\" (1946). Leading actors in several Goldwyn films, especially those directed by Wyler, were also &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor\"&gt;Oscar-nominated for their performances&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the 1930s, Goldwyn released all his films through &lt;a href=\"United%20Artists\"&gt;United Artists&lt;/a&gt;; beginning in 1941, and continuing nearly to the end of his career, Goldwyn's films were distributed by &lt;a href=\"RKO%20Pictures\"&gt;RKO Pictures&lt;/a&gt;.\nOscar triumph and later years.\nIn 1946, the year he was honored by the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Irving%20G.%20Thalberg%20Memorial%20Award\"&gt;Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award&lt;/a&gt;, Goldwyn's &lt;a href=\"Drama%20%28modern%20genre%29\"&gt;drama&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Best%20Years%20of%20Our%20Lives\"&gt;The Best Years of Our Lives&lt;/a&gt;\", starring &lt;a href=\"Myrna%20Loy\"&gt;Myrna Loy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fredric%20March\"&gt;Fredric March&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teresa%20Wright\"&gt;Teresa Wright&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dana%20Andrews\"&gt;Dana Andrews&lt;/a&gt;, won the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture\"&gt;Academy Award for Best Picture&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1950s Samuel Goldwyn turned to making a number of &lt;a href=\"musical%20film\"&gt;musicals&lt;/a&gt; including \"&lt;a href=\"Hans%20Christian%20Andersen%20%28film%29\"&gt;Hans Christian Andersen&lt;/a&gt;\" (1952) his last with &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Kaye\"&gt;Danny Kaye&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he had made many others, and \"&lt;a href=\"Guys%20and%20Dolls%20%28film%29\"&gt;Guys and Dolls&lt;/a&gt;\" (1955) starring &lt;a href=\"Marlon%20Brando\"&gt;Marlon Brando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Simmons\"&gt;Jean Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Sinatra\"&gt;Frank Sinatra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Blaine\"&gt;Vivian Blaine&lt;/a&gt;, which was based on the successful &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20theatre\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Guys%20and%20Dolls\"&gt;musical&lt;/a&gt;. This was the only independent film that Goldwyn released through &lt;a href=\"MGM\"&gt;MGM&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his final film, Samuel Goldwyn brought together African-American actors &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Poitier\"&gt;Sidney Poitier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dorothy%20Dandridge\"&gt;Dorothy Dandridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sammy%20Davis%20Jr.\"&gt;Sammy Davis Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Bailey\"&gt;Pearl Bailey&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Porgy%20and%20Bess%20%28film%29\"&gt;film rendition&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"George%20Gershwin\"&gt;George Gershwin&lt;/a&gt; opera, \"&lt;a href=\"Porgy%20and%20Bess\"&gt;Porgy and Bess&lt;/a&gt;\" (1959). Released by &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Pictures\"&gt;Columbia Pictures&lt;/a&gt;, the film was nominated for three Oscars, but won only one for &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score\"&gt;Best Original Score&lt;/a&gt;. It was also a &lt;a href=\"Box%20office%20bomb\"&gt;critical and financial failure&lt;/a&gt;, and the Gershwin family reportedly disliked the film and eventually pulled it from distribution. The film turned the &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; into an &lt;a href=\"operetta\"&gt;operetta&lt;/a&gt; with spoken dialogue in between the musical numbers. Its reception was a major disappointment for Goldwyn, who, according to biographer &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Marx\"&gt;Arthur Marx&lt;/a&gt;, saw it as his crowning glory and had wanted to film \"Porgy and Bess\" since he first saw it onstage in 1935.\nGoldwyn's house, at &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Estate\"&gt;1200 Laurel Lane&lt;/a&gt; in Beverly Hills was completed in 1934, designed by &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Honnold\"&gt;Douglas Honnold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20Vernon%20Russell\"&gt;George Vernon Russell&lt;/a&gt;. The Goldwyns hosted frequent social events at the house.\nMarriages.\nIn 1910, Goldwyn married Blanche Lasky, a sister of &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20L.%20Lasky\"&gt;Jesse L. Lasky&lt;/a&gt;. The marriage produced a daughter, Ruth. The couple divorced in 1915. In 1925, he married actress &lt;a href=\"Frances%20Howard%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Frances Howard&lt;/a&gt;, to whom he remained married for the rest of his life. Their son, &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Jr.\"&gt;Samuel Goldwyn Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, would eventually join his father in the business.\nDeath.\nGoldwyn died of &lt;a href=\"heart%20failure\"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; at his home in Los Angeles in 1974 at the age of 91. In the 1980s, the &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Studio\"&gt;Samuel Goldwyn Studio&lt;/a&gt; was sold to &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; There is a &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Theater\"&gt;theater named after him in Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt; and he received a star on the &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hollywood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt; at 1631 &lt;a href=\"Vine%20Street\"&gt;Vine Street&lt;/a&gt; for his contributions to motion pictures on February 8, 1960.\nDescendants and relations.\nGrandchildren.\nSamuel Goldwyn's grandchildren include:\nNephew.\nGoldwyn's relatives include Fred Lebensold, an award-winning architect (best known as the designer of multiple concert halls in Canada and the United States). Fred was the son of Manya Lebensold, Sam's younger sister, who was murdered in the &lt;a href=\"Holocaust\"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;, despite the best efforts of her brothers Sam and Ben in 1939\u201340 to extricate her from the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Ghetto\"&gt;Warsaw Ghetto&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Samuel Goldwyn Foundation.\nSamuel Goldwyn's will created a multimillion-dollar &lt;a href=\"Charitable%20organization\"&gt;charitable foundation&lt;/a&gt; in his name. Among other endeavors, the Samuel Goldwyn Foundation funds the &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Writing%20Awards\"&gt;Samuel Goldwyn Writing Awards&lt;/a&gt;, provided construction funds for the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Public%20Library\"&gt;Frances Howard Goldwyn Hollywood Regional Library&lt;/a&gt;, and provides ongoing funding for the &lt;a href=\"Motion%20Picture%20%26amp%3B%20Television%20Country%20House%20and%20Hospital\"&gt;Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Samuel Goldwyn Company.\nSeveral years after the senior Goldwyn's death, his son, Samuel Jr., initiated an independent film and television distribution company dedicated to preserving the integrity of Goldwyn's ambitions and work. The company's assets were later acquired by &lt;a href=\"Orion%20Pictures\"&gt;Orion Pictures&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1997, passed on to Orion's parent company, &lt;a href=\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\"&gt;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&lt;/a&gt;. Several years later, the Samuel Goldwyn Jr. Family Trust and &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; acquired the rights to all the Goldwyn-produced films except \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hurricane%20%281937%20film%29\"&gt;The Hurricane&lt;/a&gt;\", which was returned to MGM division &lt;a href=\"United%20Artists\"&gt;United Artists&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoldwynisms.\nGoldwyn was also known for his &lt;a href=\"malapropism\"&gt;malapropism&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paradox\"&gt;paradox&lt;/a&gt;es, and other &lt;a href=\"speech%20error\"&gt;speech error&lt;/a&gt;s called 'Goldwynisms' (\"a humorous statement or phrase resulting from the use of incongruous or contradictory words, situations, idioms, etc.\") and was frequently quoted. For example, he was reported to have said, \"I don't think anybody should write his autobiography until after he's dead.\" and \"Include me out.\" Some famous Goldwyn quotations are misattributions. For example, the statement attributed to Goldwyn that \"a verbal contract isn't worth the paper it's written on\" is actually a well-documented misreporting of an actual quote praising the trustworthiness of a colleague: \"His verbal contract is worth more than the paper it's written on\". The identity of the colleague is variously reported as &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20M.%20Schenck\"&gt;Joseph M. Schenck&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20L.%20Mankiewicz\"&gt;Joseph L. Mankiewicz&lt;/a&gt;. Goldwyn himself was reportedly aware of\u2014and pleased by\u2014the misattribution.\nUpon being told that a book he had purchased for filming, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20of%20Loneliness\"&gt;The Well of Loneliness&lt;/a&gt;\", couldn't be filmed because it was about &lt;a href=\"lesbian\"&gt;lesbian&lt;/a&gt;s, he reportedly replied: \"That's all right, we'll make them &lt;a href=\"Hungarians\"&gt;Hungarians&lt;/a&gt;.\" The same story was told about the 1934 rights to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Children%27s%20Hour%20%28play%29\"&gt;The Children's Hour&lt;/a&gt;\" with the response \"That's okay; we'll turn them into &lt;a href=\"Armenians\"&gt;Armenians&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Grateful%20Dead\"&gt;Grateful Dead&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Begonias\"&gt;Scarlet Begonias&lt;/a&gt;\", the line \"I ain't often right, but I've never been wrong\" appears in the &lt;a href=\"bridge%20%28music%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt;. This is very similar to Goldwyn's \"I'm willing to admit that I may not always be right, but I am never wrong.\""
