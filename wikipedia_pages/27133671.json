This meant that Newry City were automatically relegated, with Championship 1 winners &lt;a href=\"Carrick%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Carrick Rangers&lt;/a&gt; replacing them in next season's Premiership.\nIFA Premiership clubs in Europe 2010\u201311.\nUEFA coefficient and ranking.\nFor the 2010\u201311 UEFA competitions, the associations were allocated places according to their 2009 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2004\u201305 to 2008\u201309.
