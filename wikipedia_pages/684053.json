    "text": "Lisa Mary Moretti (born November 26, 1961) is an American former &lt;a href=\"professional%20wrestler\"&gt;professional wrestler&lt;/a&gt;. She is best known for her time with &lt;a href=\"WWE\"&gt;WWE&lt;/a&gt; between 1999 and 2005 under the &lt;a href=\"ring%20name\"&gt;ring name&lt;/a&gt; Ivory. Moretti is a three-time champion in WWE, and was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;WWE Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.\nMoretti began her career and first found national exposure in the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20circuit\"&gt;independent promotion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gorgeous%20Ladies%20of%20Wrestling\"&gt;Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, where she performed as Tina Ferrari from the mid-to-late-1980s. Moretti debuted in WWE in 1999 as the &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"D%27Lo%20Brown\"&gt;D'Lo Brown&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Henry\"&gt;Mark Henry&lt;/a&gt;. She won the &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Women%27s%20Championship%20%281956%E2%80%932010%29\"&gt;WWE Women's Championship&lt;/a&gt; twice, before becoming a part of the &lt;a href=\"Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;villainous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Right%20to%20Censor\"&gt;Right to Censor&lt;/a&gt;, a storyline stable of characters with harshly &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; sociopolitical views. This led to her third Women's Championship victory.\nIn her later years with WWE, she wrestled only sporadically. Moretti co-hosted \"&lt;a href=\"WWE%20Experience\"&gt;WWE Experience&lt;/a&gt;\", and served as one of the trainers on \"&lt;a href=\"WWE%20Tough%20Enough\"&gt;WWE Tough Enough&lt;/a&gt;\". After she left WWE in 2005, she wrestled for &lt;a href=\"Women%20Superstars%20Uncensored\"&gt;Women Superstars Uncensored&lt;/a&gt;, winning two other titles, and was also inducted into the WSU Hall of Fame. Moretti also began volunteering at her local &lt;a href=\"animal%20shelter\"&gt;animal shelter&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2007 opened an animal care and grooming facility named Downtown Dog in her hometown.\nProfessional wrestling career.\nEarly years (1986\u20131994).\nIn her youth, Moretti wrestled with her two brothers and sister. Later, while attending the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20California\"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; (USC), Moretti was, in her own words, \"dragged by a friend\" (later confirmed to be Nadine Kadmiri) to an audition held by the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Gorgeous%20Ladies%20of%20Wrestling\"&gt;Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (GLOW). She and Kadmiri were both successful in their audition and went on to train under &lt;a href=\"Mando%20Guerrero\"&gt;Mando Guerrero&lt;/a&gt; for six weeks, before beginning to wrestle in GLOW under the &lt;a href=\"ring%20name\"&gt;ring name&lt;/a&gt;s Tina Ferrari and Ashley Cartier respectively, also forming a &lt;a href=\"tag%20team\"&gt;tag team&lt;/a&gt; known as T &amp; A. Ferrari defeated Colonel Ninotchka to win the vacant GLOW Championship, represented by a &lt;a href=\"Crown%20%28headgear%29\"&gt;crown&lt;/a&gt;. She later wrestled for the &lt;a href=\"Powerful%20Women%20of%20Wrestling\"&gt;Powerful Women of Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; promotion and the &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Professional%20Wrestling%20Association\"&gt;Ladies Professional Wrestling Association&lt;/a&gt; under the ring names Nina and Tina Moretti, winning the POWW Championship. On September 23, 1994 at UWF's &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Wrestling%20Federation%20%28Herb%20Abrams%29\"&gt;Blackjack Brawl&lt;/a&gt; Moretti, under the name Tina Moretti, wrestled against &lt;a href=\"Candi%20Devine\"&gt;Candi Devine&lt;/a&gt; for the vacant UWF World Women's Championship in a losing effort.\nWorld Wrestling Federation/Entertainment.\nWomen's Champion (1999).\nIn January 1999, after a several year absent, Moretti returned to wrestling, signing a contract with the &lt;a href=\"WWE\"&gt;World Wrestling Federation&lt;/a&gt; (WWF). Her first appearance in WWF was accompanying &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Wright%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;The Godfather&lt;/a&gt;, a \"&lt;a href=\"pimp\"&gt;pimp&lt;/a&gt;\" character who was accompanied by various women dubbed the \"&lt;a href=\"Prostitution\"&gt;hos&lt;/a&gt;\", to the ring. On the February 13, 1999 episode of \"&lt;a href=\"WWE%20Raw\"&gt;Raw&lt;/a&gt;\", however, Moretti was introduced as Ivory, the storyline love interest of &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Henry\"&gt;Mark Henry&lt;/a&gt;. Ivory acted as the &lt;a href=\"Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;fan favorite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Valet\"&gt;valet&lt;/a&gt; for the tag team of Mark Henry and &lt;a href=\"D%27Lo%20Brown\"&gt;D'Lo Brown&lt;/a&gt;, and made her televised WWF in-ring debut on the February 15 episode of \"&lt;a href=\"WWE%20Raw\"&gt;Raw&lt;/a&gt;\", teaming with Brown to face &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Jarrett\"&gt;Jeff Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Debra%20Marshall\"&gt;Debra&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=\"Intergender%20wrestling\"&gt;intergender&lt;/a&gt; tag team match that ended in a &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23No%20contest\"&gt;no contest&lt;/a&gt;. Ivory faced Debra in a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Singles%20match\"&gt;singles match&lt;/a&gt; on the March 1 episode of \"Raw\", defeating Debra by disqualification after she was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Pretty%20Mean%20Sisters\"&gt;Pretty Mean Sisters&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jacqueline%20Moore\"&gt;Jacqueline Moore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terri%20Runnels\"&gt;Terri Runnels&lt;/a&gt;). At &lt;a href=\"WrestleMania%20XV\"&gt;WrestleMania XV&lt;/a&gt; on March 28, Ivory accompanied D'Lo Brown and &lt;a href=\"Test%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt; to the ring for their &lt;a href=\"World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship%20%28WWE%29\"&gt;WWF Tag Team Championship&lt;/a&gt; title match against Jarrett and &lt;a href=\"Owen%20Hart\"&gt;Owen Hart&lt;/a&gt;. Jarrett and Hart retained their titles following interference from Moore, Runnels, and Debra.\nDuring this time, the women in the WWF were known more for their physical appearances and &lt;a href=\"Sexual%20attraction\"&gt;\"sex appeal\"&lt;/a&gt; rather than their wrestling abilities, and featuring women in &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Strip%20matches\"&gt;strip matches&lt;/a&gt; or farcical \"slop matches\", a match that takes place in a pool of slop, were common. Ivory, who was a trained wrestler, entered into a brief feud with &lt;a href=\"Rena%20Mero\"&gt;Sable&lt;/a&gt;, the current title holder, who subsequently dropped the title to Debra. Ivory finally won the &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Women%27s%20Championship%20%281956%E2%80%932010%29\"&gt;Women's Championship&lt;/a&gt; on June 14, by defeating Debra and went on to defend her title against &lt;a href=\"Tori%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Tori&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"SummerSlam%20%281999%29\"&gt;SummerSlam&lt;/a&gt; on August 22. Ivory turned &lt;a href=\"Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;heel&lt;/a&gt; during her feud with Tori, which continued in the weeks following SummerSlam, defeating Tori in the first ever WWF women's &lt;a href=\"hardcore%20wrestling\"&gt;hardcore match&lt;/a&gt; on September 6. Ivory was then challenged by &lt;a href=\"Luna%20Vachon\"&gt;Luna Vachon&lt;/a&gt;, who Ivory defeated in a farcical hardcore match at &lt;a href=\"Unforgiven%20%281999%29\"&gt;Unforgiven&lt;/a&gt; on September 26. &lt;a href=\"Canoe.com\"&gt;SLAM! Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; called the match \"pointless and senseless\". In October 1999, Ivory feuded with &lt;a href=\"The%20Fabulous%20Moolah\"&gt;The Fabulous Moolah&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated her for the Women's Championship on October 17, 1999 at &lt;a href=\"No%20Mercy%20%281999%29\"&gt;No Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, in what John Powell of SLAM! Wrestling called the \"worst match I've ever seen\". She, however, defeated Moolah in a rematch on the October 25 episode of \"Raw\" to win her second Women's Championship. Her second title reign ended with a loss to &lt;a href=\"Stacy%20Carter\"&gt;Miss Kitty&lt;/a&gt;, an un-trained wrestler, in a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Basic%20non-elimination%20matches\"&gt;Four Corners&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Evening%20Gown%20match\"&gt;Evening Gown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Swimming%20pool\"&gt;pool match&lt;/a&gt;, a match where a wrestler wins by stripping the evening gown off of her opponents, on December 12 at &lt;a href=\"Armageddon%20%281999%29\"&gt;Armageddon&lt;/a&gt;.\nRight to Censor (2000\u20132001).\nIn late 1999, Ivory began portraying a more &lt;a href=\"Social%20conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; character. On January 23, 2000 at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Rumble%20%282000%29\"&gt;Royal Rumble&lt;/a&gt;, she grudgingly took part in the \"Miss Royal Rumble\" &lt;a href=\"Bikini%20contest\"&gt;swimsuit contest&lt;/a&gt;, which was won by &lt;a href=\"Mae%20Young\"&gt;Mae Young&lt;/a&gt;. She challenged &lt;a href=\"Jacqueline%20Moore\"&gt;Jacqueline&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Women%27s%20Championship%20%281956%E2%80%932010%29\"&gt;WWF Women's Championship&lt;/a&gt; on March 9, but she was unsuccessful. A few weeks later on an episode of Smackdown, she became the first woman to attempt to win the &lt;a href=\"WWF%20Hardcore%20Championship\"&gt;WWF Hardcore Championship&lt;/a&gt;, after unsuccesfully trying to pin &lt;a href=\"Crash%20Holly\"&gt;Crash Holly&lt;/a&gt; backstage. Following a period of absence, Ivory returned to WWF television in October 2000 as a member of a villainous alliance of conservative wrestlers known as &lt;a href=\"Right%20to%20Censor\"&gt;Right to Censor&lt;/a&gt;. The change in character saw her don less suggestive ring attire and more conservative hairstyles. Ivory quickly began a rivalry with Women's Champion &lt;a href=\"Lita%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Lita&lt;/a&gt;, winning the Women's Championship for the third time by defeating Lita, &lt;a href=\"Jacqueline%20Moore\"&gt;Jacqueline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Trish%20Stratus\"&gt;Trish Stratus&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Basic%20non-elimination%20matches\"&gt;Fatal Four-Way match&lt;/a&gt;. She retained the title against Lita at the &lt;a href=\"Survivor%20Series%20%282000%29\"&gt;Survivor Series&lt;/a&gt; on November 19, with the assistance of Right to Censor leader &lt;a href=\"Stevie%20Richards\"&gt;Steven Richards&lt;/a&gt;, in a match that &lt;a href=\"Canoe.ca\"&gt;SLAM! Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; claimed \"illustrated to what heights women's wrestling is capable of reaching in North America if the right talent is permitted to strut their stuff in a wrestling ring and not a pit full of jello.\" Ivory also retained her title in a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Basic%20non-elimination%20matches\"&gt;Triple Threat match&lt;/a&gt; against Stratus and &lt;a href=\"Nora%20Greenwald\"&gt;Molly Holly&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Armageddon%20%282000%29\"&gt;Armageddon&lt;/a&gt; on December 10.\nIvory and the Right to Censor began feuding with &lt;a href=\"Chyna\"&gt;Chyna&lt;/a&gt; after the latter posed for \"&lt;a href=\"Playboy\"&gt;Playboy&lt;/a&gt;\" in late 2000. On the December 7 episode of \"Raw\", Ivory and &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Morley\"&gt;Val Venis&lt;/a&gt; delivered a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20double-team%20maneuvers%23Aided%20piledriver\"&gt;double-team piledriver&lt;/a&gt; to Chyna which, in storyline, injured her neck. Chyna challenged Ivory for the Women's Championship at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Rumble%20%282001%29\"&gt;Royal Rumble&lt;/a&gt; on January 21, 2001. Ivory retained her title when she pinned Chyna, who had appeared to re-aggravate her neck injury. Chyna challenged Ivory for the title once more at &lt;a href=\"WrestleMania%20X-Seven\"&gt;WrestleMania X-Seven&lt;/a&gt; on April 1 and defeated Ivory in a brief match, ending Ivory's third reign as Women's Champion. The Right to Censor stable was finally disbanded on April 26, 2001.\nVarious storylines (2001\u20132005).\nIvory returned to WWF television on the August 6 episode of \"Raw\", joining &lt;a href=\"The%20Alliance%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;The Alliance&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Invasion%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;The Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, a storyline where the former wrestlers of &lt;a href=\"World%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;World Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (WCW) and &lt;a href=\"Extreme%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;Extreme Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (ECW) formed an alliance and \"invaded\" the WWF. Ivory formed an alliance with former WCW wrestlers &lt;a href=\"Torrie%20Wilson\"&gt;Torrie Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stacy%20Keibler\"&gt;Stacy Keibler&lt;/a&gt; after helping them defeat &lt;a href=\"Jacqueline%20Moore\"&gt;Jacqueline&lt;/a&gt; in a handicap match, but later turned on Wilson due to her budding romance with &lt;a href=\"Yoshihiro%20Tajiri\"&gt;Tajiri&lt;/a&gt;. Ivory eventually became the valet for &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Storm\"&gt;Lance Storm&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"WWE%20No%20Mercy%232001\"&gt;No Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, Ivory accompanied Storm and &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20Helms\"&gt;The Hurricane&lt;/a&gt; to the ring, but the &lt;a href=\"Hardy%20Boyz\"&gt;Hardy Boyz&lt;/a&gt; defeated the two men to retain their &lt;a href=\"WCW%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship\"&gt;WCW World Tag Team Championship&lt;/a&gt;. Ivory went on to compete in the women's division, and on November 18 at the &lt;a href=\"Survivor%20Series%20%282001%29\"&gt;Survivor Series&lt;/a&gt;, she participated in a six-pack challenge for the vacant &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Women%27s%20Championship%20%281956%E2%80%932010%29\"&gt;Women's Championship&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Trish%20Stratus\"&gt;Trish Stratus&lt;/a&gt; won.\nIn early 2002, Ivory served as a trainer in the second series of \"&lt;a href=\"WWE%20Tough%20Enough%23Tough%20Enough%202\"&gt;Tough Enough&lt;/a&gt;\". After the World Wrestling Federation was renamed \"World Wrestling Entertainment\" and the roster was split into two \"brands\", &lt;a href=\"Raw%20%28WWE%20brand%29\"&gt;Raw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SmackDown%20%28WWE%20brand%29\"&gt;SmackDown!&lt;/a&gt;, Ivory was &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Brand%20Extension%23Raw%20and%20SmackDown%21\"&gt;drafted&lt;/a&gt; to the SmackDown! brand. Continuing to portray a villainess, Ivory engaged in a brief feud with \"Tough Enough\" co-winners &lt;a href=\"Linda%20Miles\"&gt;Linda Miles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Gayda\"&gt;Jackie Gayda&lt;/a&gt;, which led to her facing Miles on the June 8 episode of \"&lt;a href=\"WWE%20Velocity\"&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt;\". Ivory won the match after Gayda shoved Miles off the top rope and costing her the match. On the June 13 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Ivory teamed with Gayda in a losing effort against Miles and Trish Stratus. Along with several other SmackDown! wrestlers, Ivory was traded to Raw in exchange for The &lt;a href=\"Big%20Show\"&gt;Big Show&lt;/a&gt; in November 2002. Throughout the remainder of 2002, she teamed with &lt;a href=\"Lisa%20Marie%20Varon\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; in tag team matches and feuded with Trish Stratus. In November of that year, she was also part of the WWE Raw Tour in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first female performer to tour the country, however only appeared in media events and signings, as she was not booked to compete.\nIn 2003, Ivory became a &lt;a href=\"Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;face&lt;/a&gt;, and wrestled sporadically in the women's division. In June of that year, she had three pinfall victories over the WWE Women's Champion, &lt;a href=\"Jazz%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Jazz&lt;/a&gt;, but never received a title match opportunity. Her only &lt;a href=\"pay-per-view\"&gt;pay-per-view&lt;/a&gt; appearance in the course of the year was on December 14 at &lt;a href=\"Armageddon%20%282003%29\"&gt;Armageddon&lt;/a&gt;, where she unsuccessfully challenged &lt;a href=\"Nora%20Greenwald\"&gt;Molly Holly&lt;/a&gt; for the Women's Championship, after Molly grabbed her tights for leverage, and managed to capture the victory. She also served as a trainer on the &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Tough%20Enough%23Tough%20Enough%20III\"&gt;third season&lt;/a&gt; of \"Tough Enough\", and did broadcasting duties at WWE events. Ivory also spent eight weeks working as a trainer at WWE's then-&lt;a href=\"Farm%20team\"&gt;developmental territory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20Valley%20Wrestling\"&gt;Ohio Valley Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (OVW) and also made one televised appearance against &lt;a href=\"Jillian%20Hall\"&gt;Jillian Hall&lt;/a&gt; in a losing effort. In May of that year, she and &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Grisham\"&gt;Todd Grisham&lt;/a&gt; began hosting \"&lt;a href=\"The%20WWE%20Experience\"&gt;The WWE Experience&lt;/a&gt;\", a weekly television show that recapped events from \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\". On July 22, 2005, several weeks before \"WWE Experience\" ended in August 2005, WWE announced that Ivory had opted not to renew her contract with the company.\nReturn to the independent circuit (2005\u20132006).\nAfter leaving WWE, Moretti began wrestling sporadically on the &lt;a href=\"independent%20circuit\"&gt;independent circuit&lt;/a&gt; under her birth name. On November 19, 2005 in &lt;a href=\"Spartanburg%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Spartanburg, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; at \"A Tribute to &lt;a href=\"Starrcade\"&gt;Starrcade&lt;/a&gt;\", she teamed with Bambi to defeat &lt;a href=\"Team%20Blondage\"&gt;Team Blondage&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kristin%20Eubanks\"&gt;Krissy Vaine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amber%20O%27Neal\"&gt;Amber O'Neal&lt;/a&gt;) for the CCW Tag Team Championship. On April 21, 2006 in &lt;a href=\"Surrey%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Surrey, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, Moretti defeated &lt;a href=\"Becky%20Lynch\"&gt;Rebecca Knox&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Canadian%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (ECCW)'s &lt;a href=\"ECCW%20Women%27s%20Championship\"&gt;NWA SuperGirls Championship&lt;/a&gt;. She also successfully retained her title in a match the following night. Afterward, Moretti decided to stay with ECCW to help create a strong women's division. She held the title for approximately five months before losing it to &lt;a href=\"Natalya%20Neidhart\"&gt;Nattie Neidhart&lt;/a&gt; on October 8, 2006.\nOn March 5, 2011, Moretti appeared at the &lt;a href=\"Women%20Superstars%20Uncensored\"&gt;Women Superstars Uncensored&lt;/a&gt; (WSU) 4 Year Anniversary event, where she was inducted into the WSU Hall of Fame.

As a result, Stephie was able to win, capturing the championship and thanking Ivory for her help.\nSporadic WWE appearances (2015\u2013present).\nIvory took part in the &lt;a href=\"WrestleMania%20Axxess\"&gt;WrestleMania Axxess&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fan%20convention\"&gt;convention&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"WrestleMania%2031\"&gt;WrestleMania 31&lt;/a&gt; in March 2015.
