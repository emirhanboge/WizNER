approved the building of a new high school, called Northeast Queens High School, near the intersection of &lt;a href=\"Utopia%20Parkway%20%28Queens%29\"&gt;Utopia Parkway&lt;/a&gt; and 59th Avenue, with a capacity of 3,000 students. The city bought 11 acres of land, and the City Planning Commission agreed that the high school was needed, but the Commission did not approve the allocation of money to build the school in the capital budget.\nIn August 1956, the city approved the hiring of the firm of &lt;a href=\"Eggers%20%26amp%3B%20Higgins\"&gt;Eggers &amp; Higgins&lt;/a&gt; to be the architect of the building, although the budget to actually build the high school was not yet approved.\nIn October 1956, &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City\"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Robert%20F.%20Wagner%20Jr.\"&gt;Robert F. Wagner Jr.&lt;/a&gt; wrote a letter to the City Planning Commission asking it to include the construction of Northeast Queens High School in its capital budget. The construction was included in the capital budget in 1957.\nIn March 1958, the Board of Education approved a contract to build the high school. A $4,229,000 contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, Caristo Construction Company. The ground-breaking happened that same year. A group of parents tried to have an indoor swimming pool built in the high school, but they were not successful. The high school ended up costing $6,100,000 to build.\nFrancis Lewis High School opened on September 13, 1960. The school was named after &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Lewis\"&gt;Francis Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, a resident of &lt;a href=\"Whitestone%2C%20Queens\"&gt;Whitestone&lt;/a&gt; who signed the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence\"&gt;United States Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. Vincent McGarrett was the first principal.
