    "text": "Albert Pissis (1852\u20131914) was a prolific San Francisco architect who studied at the &lt;a href=\"%C3%89cole%20des%20Beaux-Arts\"&gt;\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, France and is credited with introducing the &lt;a href=\"Beaux-Arts%20architecture\"&gt;Beaux-Arts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"architectural%20style\"&gt;architectural style&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2C%20California\"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt;, designing a number of important buildings in the city in the years before and after the &lt;a href=\"1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake\"&gt;1906 San Francisco earthquake&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife and career.\nPissis was born on April 26, 1852 in &lt;a href=\"Guaymas\"&gt;Guaymas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20state\"&gt;Mexican state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sonora\"&gt;Sonora&lt;/a&gt;. His father was Jose Etienne Pissis (1808-1880), a native of France and a physician, who moved his family to San Francisco, California from Guaymas when Pissis was six. His mother was Juana Bazozabel \"Jane\" de Bustamante (1824-1893), a native of Guaymas.\nPissis was one of the first Americans to study at the &lt;a href=\"%C3%89cole%20des%20Beaux-Arts\"&gt;\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. He returned in 1880 to San Francisco, which at the time was a fairly provincial &lt;a href=\"Old%20West\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; town despite its wealth, with buildings designed in a variety of architectural styles.\nIn 1882 Pissis became a member of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Institute%20of%20Architects\"&gt;American Institute of Architects&lt;/a&gt; and, with partner William P. Moore, designed a number of buildings in flamboyant &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Anne%20style%20architecture%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Queen Anne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastlake%20style\"&gt;Eastlake&lt;/a&gt; styles. However, by the 1890s he was a major figure in the &lt;a href=\"Neoclassical%20architecture\"&gt;Neoclassical&lt;/a&gt; (Classical Revival) movement, particularly Beaux-Arts, and introduced that style to San Francisco beginning with the &lt;a href=\"Hibernia%20Bank%20%28San%20Francisco%29\"&gt;Hibernia Bank&lt;/a&gt; building in 1892. Initially considered revolutionary, the style became popular among the city's powerful commercial and banking concerns. The dome he designed for the Emporium Department Store, now part of the &lt;a href=\"Westfield%20San%20Francisco%20Centre\"&gt;Westfield San Francisco Centre&lt;/a&gt;, is often considered a \"masterpiece\".\nPissis played a major role in San Francisco's reconstruction following the Great Earthquake of 1906, both as a designer of a number of the city's landmark buildings, and as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Committee%20of%20Fifty%20%281906%29\"&gt;Committee of Fifty&lt;/a&gt;. He was also President of the local AIA chapter from 1907 to 1908.\nAlthough popular and internationally known at the time, Pissis's approach to design was derided by later critics as reactionary, and blamed for suppressing more original architects such as &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright\"&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Sullivan\"&gt;Louis Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; in favor of imitation of older European traditions. However, in more recent years his buildings have been increasingly praised.\nPissis died on July 5, 1914 of &lt;a href=\"pneumonia\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; at age 62, in his suite at the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Francis%20Hotel\"&gt;St. Francis Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. He was survived by his widow, Georgia, who in 1920 sold land to &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20City%2C%20California\"&gt;Redwood City, California&lt;/a&gt;, that became &lt;a href=\"Sequoia%20High%20School%20%28Redwood%20City%2C%20California%29\"&gt;Sequoia High School&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable works.\nAmong the buildings Pissis designed are:"
