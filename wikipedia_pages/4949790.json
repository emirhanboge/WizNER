He was of English descent. His career ranged from 1942 to 1997, with more than seventy movie and television appearances. He and his wife, the former Mary Cain Peckham, were members of the &lt;a href=\"Peninsula%20Players\"&gt;Peninsula Players&lt;/a&gt; summer theater program during the 1930s.\nKeach appeared in a 1955 episode of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Ranger%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Lone Ranger&lt;/a&gt;\".

By the time Keach took the role, however, he was the head of an industrial film company (a position he had held since 1948). Keach eventually gave up the role of Carlson when one too many clients were unable to reach him, and he had to respond, \"I've been working in the CONTROL labs.\"\nIn 1964 he appeared on \"&lt;a href=\"Perry%20Mason%20%281957%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Perry Mason&lt;/a&gt;\" in the role of Lt.
