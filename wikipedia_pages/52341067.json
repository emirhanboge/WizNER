    "text": "James Edward Beasley (born September 30, 1931) is an American &lt;a href=\"rhythm%20and%20blues\"&gt;rhythm and blues&lt;/a&gt; singer, pianist and songwriter.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Kansas City, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, Beasley learned piano from Willie Rice, and was heavily influenced by &lt;a href=\"Fats%20Domino\"&gt;Fats Domino&lt;/a&gt;. He was also a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Gloves\"&gt;Golden Gloves&lt;/a&gt; winning &lt;a href=\"amateur%20boxer\"&gt;amateur boxer&lt;/a&gt;, and sang in the Aces Quartet and the Sonny Kenner Trio. In 1954, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, and joined &lt;a href=\"King%20Perry\"&gt;King Perry&lt;/a&gt;'s band, with whom he recorded for &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Records\"&gt;Hollywood Records&lt;/a&gt;. He also recorded under his own name for the &lt;a href=\"Peacock%20Records\"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Modern%20Records\"&gt;Modern&lt;/a&gt; labels, in a style similar to Fats Domino.\nAlthough Beasley had no national chart hits, \"Ella Jane\", recorded with a band that included saxophonists &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Davis\"&gt;Maxwell Davis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plas%20Johnson\"&gt;Plas Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, and guitarist &lt;a href=\"Rene%20Hall\"&gt;Rene Hall&lt;/a&gt;, sold moderately well, and Beasley regularly played in Los Angeles clubs. Some of Beasley's recordings on Modern, including \"Don't Feel Sorry for Me\" and \"Little Coquette\" were recorded in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; in 1956 with &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Bartholomew\"&gt;Dave Bartholomew&lt;/a&gt;'s band, and \"Little Coquette\" was later recorded by Fats Domino. Beasley also backed &lt;a href=\"Etta%20James\"&gt;Etta James&lt;/a&gt; at recording sessions in New Orleans.\nAfter having a moderate regional hit with \"My Happiness\" in 1956, Beasley formed his own band and moved to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked for &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Freed\"&gt;Alan Freed&lt;/a&gt;, performed alongside &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Charles\"&gt;Ray Charles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elvis%20Presley\"&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ruth%20Brown\"&gt;Ruth Brown&lt;/a&gt;, appeared on numerous TV shows, and continued to write for Fats Domino and others. He continued to record for Modern and its subsidiary &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Records\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; label, who released an &lt;a href=\"LP%20record\"&gt;LP&lt;/a&gt;, \"Jimmy's House Party\", which was repackaged in 1961 with a slightly different track listing as \"Twist with Jimmy Beasley\". His last recordings, \"Ready To Go\" / \"My Baby's Gone\", were released in 1965. His records were among those that influenced the development of &lt;a href=\"ska\"&gt;ska&lt;/a&gt; music in &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1970s, Beasley appeared in cabaret in &lt;a href=\"Reno\"&gt;Reno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, and regularly in &lt;a href=\"Laughlin%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Laughlin, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. He then moved to &lt;a href=\"Torrance%2C%20California\"&gt;Torrance, California&lt;/a&gt;, where he owned a club and continued to perform occasionally. He also appeared at blues festivals in Europe in the 1990s, but retired from performing after a &lt;a href=\"stroke\"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1990s."
