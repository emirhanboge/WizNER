    "text": "Viola Hashe (1926-1977) was a teacher, anti-&lt;a href=\"apartheid\"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt; activist and &lt;a href=\"Trade%20union\"&gt;trade unionist&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Hashe was also &lt;a href=\"Visual%20impairment\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt;. \nBiography.\nHashe was born in 1926 in the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Free%20State%20%28province%29\"&gt;Orange Free State&lt;/a&gt;. She started working with the trade unions and joined the &lt;a href=\"African%20National%20Congress\"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; (ANC) in the 1950s. She became a member of the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Congress%20of%20Trade%20Unions\"&gt;South African Congress of Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt; (SACTU) in the mid-1950s. In 1956, she worked on the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Clothing%20Workers%20Union\"&gt;South African Clothing Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; (SACWU) where she became the first woman leader of an all-male South African union. Hashe spoke at the SACTU conference in &lt;a href=\"Durban\"&gt;Durban&lt;/a&gt; where she discussed passes for women, since women weren't allowed to hold passes.\nHashe became the first woman to be threatened with deportation under the &lt;a href=\"Pass%20laws\"&gt;Urban Areas Act&lt;/a&gt; in 1956. She had the counsel of &lt;a href=\"Shulamith%20Muller\"&gt;Shulamith Muller&lt;/a&gt;, and the order to deport her was rescinded \"barely seven hours before the order was to take effect.\" In 1963, Hashe was banned under the &lt;a href=\"Suppression%20of%20Communism%20Act%2C%201950\"&gt;Suppression of Communism Act, 1950&lt;/a&gt; and then \"restricted to &lt;a href=\"Roodepoort\"&gt;Roodepoort&lt;/a&gt;\" until her death in 1977.\nHashe influenced many people who became activists or who were already working as activists. These included &lt;a href=\"Bertha%20Gxowa\"&gt;Bertha Gxowa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mabel%20Balfour\"&gt;Mabel Balfour&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Moodley\"&gt;Mary Moodley&lt;/a&gt;. A branch of the &lt;a href=\"African%20National%20Congress\"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; Youth League is named after Hashe."
