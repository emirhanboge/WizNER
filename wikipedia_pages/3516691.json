    "text": "Pedro Nolasco (February 2, 1962 \u2013 September 15, 1995) was a &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Republic\"&gt;Dominican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt;, who won the bronze medal in the men's bantamweight category at the &lt;a href=\"1984%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1984 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, United States.\nThis was the first Olympic medal of the Dominican Republic. A year earlier he won a silver at the &lt;a href=\"Boxing%20at%20the%201983%20Pan%20American%20Games\"&gt;1983 Pan American Games&lt;/a&gt;. He was born in La Romana, Dominican Republic.\nNolasco turned pro in 1986 and had limited success, possibly a result of having moved up the professional ladder too quickly. In 1987 he dropped a pair of fights to future champion &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Lopez%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Tony Lopez&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the year he lost a by first-round knockout to former world champ &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Callejas\"&gt;Victor Callejas&lt;/a&gt;. In 1989 he took on &lt;a href=\"Maurizio%20Stecca\"&gt;Maurizio Stecca&lt;/a&gt; for the newly created WBO Featherweight Title, but lost in a 6th-round TKO.\nNolasco was shot and killed in an attempted robbery at his home in La Romana on September 15, 1995 at the age of 33."
