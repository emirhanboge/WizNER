The 1992 Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira was contested over two legs, and opposed &lt;a href=\"Boavista%20F.C.\"&gt;Boavista&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Primeira%20Liga\"&gt;Primeira Liga&lt;/a&gt;.

The second leg which took place at the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20do%20Bessa\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio do Bessa&lt;/a&gt;, saw a 2\u20132 draw between both sides, with Boavista recovering from a 0\u20132 deficit in the last 10 minutes of the game, and thus allowed Boavista to win 4\u20133 on aggregate over two legs which would give the \"Panteras\" their second Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira after their first conquest in 1979, also against Porto, in the very first edition of the competition."
