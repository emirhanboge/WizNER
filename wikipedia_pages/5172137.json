    "text": "Savvas Kofidis (; born 5 February 1961) is a Greek &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"coach%20%28sport%29\"&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href=\"midfielder\"&gt;midfielder&lt;/a&gt; player.\nCareer.\nBorn in modern-day &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Pontic%20Greeks\"&gt;Pontic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Greeks\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; parents, he started his career in Iraklis, debuting on 18 January 1981 when Iraklis was participating in the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Ethniki\"&gt;Beta Ethniki&lt;/a&gt;. In Iraklis's team he played seven seasons before heading to &lt;a href=\"Olympiacos%20F.C.\"&gt;Olympiacos&lt;/a&gt;. In 1992, he joined &lt;a href=\"Aris%20Thessaloniki%20F.C.\"&gt;Aris Thessaloniki F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, the city rivals of Iraklis, where he played until rejoining Iraklis in the 1996\u201397 season.\nInternational career.\nHis three appearances at the &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; rounded off his &lt;a href=\"Greece%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;national team&lt;/a&gt; career, which lasted from 1982 to 1994, giving him 67 caps and 1 international goal (9 January 1985, against &lt;a href=\"Israel%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;). He retired from professional football in 1999.\nCoaching career.\nDuring the 2002\u20132003 period he was the assistant coach of &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Jovanovi%C4%87%20%28coach%29\"&gt;Ivan Jovanovic&lt;/a&gt; in Iraklis, as well as the next period, assisting head coach &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Markari%C3%A1n\"&gt;Sergio Markari\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;. After Markari\u00e1n resigned, Kofidis took in charge as the head coach. The next year, with Kofidis taking the reins, was hugely successful as \"The Old One\", against all expectations, finished 4th in the &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Ethniki%202005-06\"&gt;2005\u20132006&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Ethniki\"&gt;Alpha Ethniki&lt;/a&gt; championship, and qualified for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. During the summer, however, many key players were sold as the team was in heavy debt, and the following year was anything but successful. After a string of 10 league matches without a win, and an early exit from the UEFA Cup against Polish team &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, Kofidis resigned. In January 2007 he became head coach in &lt;a href=\"Skoda%20Xanthi\"&gt;Skoda Xanthi&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"Takis%20Lemonis\"&gt;Takis Lemonis&lt;/a&gt;'s resignation, but soon left the job. On 30 October 2009 &lt;a href=\"Iraklis%20F.C.\"&gt;Iraklis F.C.&lt;/a&gt; club officials have sacked coach &lt;a href=\"Oleg%20Protasov\"&gt;Oleg Protasov&lt;/a&gt; to replace him with Kofidis."
