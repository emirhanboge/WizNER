    "title": "SimpleText",
    "text": "SimpleText is the &lt;a href=\"native%20%28computing%29\"&gt;native&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"text%20editor\"&gt;text editor&lt;/a&gt; for the Apple &lt;a href=\"classic%20Mac%20OS\"&gt;classic Mac OS&lt;/a&gt;. SimpleText allows text editing and text formatting (underline, italic, bold, etc.), fonts, and sizes. It was developed to integrate the features included in the different versions of &lt;a href=\"TeachText\"&gt;TeachText&lt;/a&gt; that were created by various software development groups within &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Inc.\"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt can be considered similar to Windows' &lt;a href=\"WordPad\"&gt;WordPad&lt;/a&gt; application. In later versions it also gained additional read only display capabilities for &lt;a href=\"PICT\"&gt;PICT&lt;/a&gt; files, as well as other Mac OS built-in formats like Quickdraw GX and &lt;a href=\"QTIF\"&gt;QTIF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3DMF\"&gt;3DMF&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"QuickTime\"&gt;QuickTime&lt;/a&gt; movies. SimpleText can even record short sound samples and, using Apple's &lt;a href=\"Apple%20PlainTalk\"&gt;PlainTalk&lt;/a&gt; speech system, read out text in English. Users who wanted to add sounds longer than 24\u00a0seconds, however, needed to use a separate program to create the sound and then paste the desired sound into the document using &lt;a href=\"ResEdit\"&gt;ResEdit&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimpleText superseded &lt;a href=\"TeachText\"&gt;TeachText&lt;/a&gt;, which was included in System Software up until it was replaced in 1994 (shipped with System Update 3.0 and System 7.1.2). The need for SimpleText arose after Apple stopped bundling &lt;a href=\"MacWrite\"&gt;MacWrite&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure that every user could open and read &lt;a href=\"Readme\"&gt;Readme&lt;/a&gt; documents.\nThe key improvement of SimpleText over TeachText was the addition of text styling. The &lt;a href=\"System%207\"&gt;underlying OS&lt;/a&gt; required by SimpleText implemented a standard &lt;a href=\"styled%20text\"&gt;styled text&lt;/a&gt; format, which meant that SimpleText could support multiple fonts and font sizes. Prior Macintosh OS versions lacked this feature, so TeachText supported only a single font per document. Adding text styling features made SimpleText WorldScript-savvy, meaning that it can use Simplified and Traditional Chinese characters. Like TeachText, SimpleText was also limited to only 32\u00a0kB of text in a document, although images could increase the total file size beyond this limit. SimpleText style information was stored in the file's &lt;a href=\"resource%20fork\"&gt;resource fork&lt;/a&gt; in such a way that if the resource fork was stripped (such as by uploading to a non-Macintosh server), the text information would be retained.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Mac%20OS%20X\"&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, SimpleText is replaced by the more powerful &lt;a href=\"TextEdit\"&gt;TextEdit&lt;/a&gt; application, which reads and writes more document formats as well as including &lt;a href=\"word%20processor\"&gt;word processor&lt;/a&gt;-like features such as a &lt;a href=\"ruler\"&gt;ruler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spell%20checking\"&gt;spell checking&lt;/a&gt;. TextEdit's styled text format is &lt;a href=\"Rich%20Text%20Format\"&gt;RTF&lt;/a&gt;, which is able to survive a single-forked file system intact.\nApple has released the source code for a &lt;a href=\"Carbon%20%28computing%29\"&gt;Carbon&lt;/a&gt; version of SimpleText in the &lt;a href=\"Mac%20OS%20X%20Panther\"&gt;Mac OS X Panther&lt;/a&gt; (10.3) Developer Tools. If the 10.3 Developer Tools are installed, it can be found at . Alternatively, the sample code can be found in Apple's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//developer.apple.com/library/archive/navigation/\"&gt;Documentation Archive&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https%3A//developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/SimpleText_Sample/Introduction/Intro.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10000736\"&gt;SimpleText Sample&lt;/a&gt;."
