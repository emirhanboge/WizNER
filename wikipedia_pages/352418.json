    "text": "Bolton (, locally ) is a large town in &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Greater Manchester&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"North%20West%20England\"&gt;North West England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;historically&lt;/a&gt; and traditionally a part of &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;. A former &lt;a href=\"mill%20town\"&gt;mill town&lt;/a&gt;, Bolton has been a production centre for textiles since &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20people\"&gt;Flemish&lt;/a&gt; weavers settled in the area in the 14th century, introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition. The urbanisation and development of the town largely coincided with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"textile%20manufacture%20during%20the%20Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Bolton was a 19th-century &lt;a href=\"boomtown\"&gt;boomtown&lt;/a&gt; and, at its zenith in 1929, its 216\u00a0&lt;a href=\"cotton%20mill\"&gt;cotton mill&lt;/a&gt;s and 26\u00a0bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of &lt;a href=\"Spinning%20%28textiles%29\"&gt;cotton spinning&lt;/a&gt; in the world. The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War and, by the 1980s, cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in Bolton.\nClose to the &lt;a href=\"West%20Pennine%20Moors\"&gt;West Pennine Moors&lt;/a&gt;, Bolton is north-west of &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;. It is surrounded by several neighbouring towns and villages that together form the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Bolton\"&gt;Metropolitan Borough of Bolton&lt;/a&gt;, of which Bolton is the &lt;a href=\"administrative%20centre\"&gt;administrative centre&lt;/a&gt;. The town of Bolton has a population of 139,403, whilst the wider metropolitan borough has a population of 262,400. Bolton originated as a small settlement in the moorland known as &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20le%20Moors\"&gt;Bolton le Moors&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the town was a &lt;a href=\"Roundhead\"&gt;Parliamentarian&lt;/a&gt; outpost in a staunchly &lt;a href=\"Cavalier\"&gt;Royalist&lt;/a&gt; region and, as a result, was stormed by 3,000\u00a0Royalist troops led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Rupert%20of%20the%20Rhine\"&gt;Prince Rupert of the Rhine&lt;/a&gt; in 1644. In what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Massacre\"&gt;Bolton Massacre&lt;/a&gt;, 1,600\u00a0residents were killed and 700 were taken prisoner.\n&lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; football club play home games at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Bolton%20Stadium\"&gt;University of Bolton Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20WBA%20world%20champions\"&gt;WBA World&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20super%20lightweight%20boxing%20champions\"&gt;light-welterweight champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amir%20Khan%20%28British%20boxer%29\"&gt;Amir Khan&lt;/a&gt; was born in the town. Cultural interests include the &lt;a href=\"Octagon%20Theatre%2C%20Bolton\"&gt;Octagon Theatre&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Museum\"&gt;Bolton Museum&lt;/a&gt; and Art Gallery, as well as one of the earliest public libraries established after the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Libraries%20Act%201850\"&gt;Public Libraries Act 1850&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nToponymy.\nBolton is a common Northern English name derived from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; -, meaning a settlement with a dwelling. The first recorded use of the name, in the form \"Boelton\", dates from 1185 to describe Bolton le Moors, though this may not be in relation to a dwelling. It was recorded as Bothelton in 1212, Botelton in 1257, Boulton in 1288, and Bolton after 1307.\nLater forms of Botheltun were Bodeltown, Botheltun-le-Moors, Bowelton, Boltune, Bolton-super-Moras, Bolton-in-ye-Moors, Bolton-le-Moors.\nThe town's motto of means \"overcome difficulties\" (or \"delays\"), and is a pun on the Bolton-super-Moras version of the name meaning literally, \"Bolton on the moors\". The name itself is referred to in the &lt;a href=\"Badge%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;badge&lt;/a&gt; of the Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council using a form of visual pun, a &lt;a href=\"rebus\"&gt;rebus&lt;/a&gt;, in combining motifs of arrow for 'bolt' and heraldic crown for 'tun', the term for the central high point of a defensive position that is the etymon of the suffix of Bolton.\nEarly history to the Civil War.\nThere is evidence of human existence on the moors around Bolton since the early part of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Age%20Britain\"&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt;, including a &lt;a href=\"stone%20circle\"&gt;stone circle&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Cheetham%20Close\"&gt;Cheetham Close&lt;/a&gt; above &lt;a href=\"Egerton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Egerton&lt;/a&gt;, and Bronze Age burial mounds on &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Hill%20%28North%20West%20England%29\"&gt;Winter Hill&lt;/a&gt;. A Bronze Age mound was excavated in Victorian times outside Haulgh Hall. The Romans built roads from Manchester to &lt;a href=\"Ribchester\"&gt;Ribchester&lt;/a&gt; to the east and a road along what is now the A6 to the west. It is claimed that &lt;a href=\"Gnaeus%20Julius%20Agricola\"&gt;Agricola&lt;/a&gt; built a fort at &lt;a href=\"Blackrod\"&gt;Blackrod&lt;/a&gt; by clearing land above the forest. Evidence of a &lt;a href=\"Saxons\"&gt;Saxon&lt;/a&gt; settlement exists in the form of religious objects found when the Victorian parish church was built.\nIn 1067 &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bolton\"&gt;Great Bolton&lt;/a&gt; was the property of &lt;a href=\"Roger%20de%20Poitou\"&gt;Roger de Poitou&lt;/a&gt; and after 1100, of Roger de Meresheys. It became the property of the &lt;a href=\"Pilkington%20of%20Lancashire\"&gt;Pilkingtons&lt;/a&gt; who forfeited it in the Civil War and after that the Stanleys who became &lt;a href=\"Earls%20of%20Derby\"&gt;Earls of Derby&lt;/a&gt;. Great Bolton and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bolton\"&gt;Little Bolton&lt;/a&gt; were part of the Marsey fee, in 1212 Little Bolton was held by Roger de Bolton as plough-land, by the service of the twelfth part of a knight's fee to Randle de Marsey. The parish church in Bolton has an early foundation although the exact date is unknown; it was given by the lord of the manor to the &lt;a href=\"Gilbertine\"&gt;Gilbertine&lt;/a&gt; canons of &lt;a href=\"Mattersey%20Priory\"&gt;Mattersey Priory&lt;/a&gt; in Nottinghamshire, founded by Roger de Marsey.\nA charter to hold a market in Churchgate was granted on 14 December 1251 by King &lt;a href=\"Henry%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry III of England&lt;/a&gt;. Bolton became a market town and borough by a charter from the Earl of Derby, William de Ferrers, on 14 January 1253, and a market was held until the 18th century. &lt;a href=\"Burgage\"&gt;Burgage&lt;/a&gt; plots were laid out on Churchgate and Deansgate in the centre of the &lt;a href=\"medieval\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; town close to where &lt;a href=\"Ye%20Olde%20Man%20%26amp%3B%20Scythe\"&gt;Ye Olde Man &amp; Scythe&lt;/a&gt; public house, dating from 1251, is situated today.\nIn 1337 Flemish weavers settled and introduced the manufacture of woollen cloth. More Flemish weavers, fleeing the &lt;a href=\"Huguenot\"&gt;Huguenot&lt;/a&gt; persecutions, settled here in the 17th century. The second wave of settlers wove &lt;a href=\"fustian\"&gt;fustian&lt;/a&gt;, a rough cloth made of linen and cotton. Digging &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;sea coal&lt;/a&gt; was recorded in 1374. There was an outbreak of the plague in the town in 1623.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the people of Bolton were &lt;a href=\"Puritan\"&gt;Puritan&lt;/a&gt;s and supported the &lt;a href=\"Roundhead\"&gt;Parliamentarian&lt;/a&gt; cause. A parliamentary garrison in the town was attacked twice without success but on 28 May 1644 Prince Rupert's &lt;a href=\"Royalist\"&gt;Royalist&lt;/a&gt; army with troops under the command of the &lt;a href=\"James%20Stanley%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Derby\"&gt;Earl of Derby&lt;/a&gt; attacked again. The attack became known as the &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Massacre\"&gt;Bolton Massacre&lt;/a&gt; in which 1,500 died, 700 were taken prisoner and the town plundered. The attackers took to referring to the town as the \"Geneva of the North\", referencing &lt;a href=\"Geneva\"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt;'s dominant &lt;a href=\"Calvinism\"&gt;Calvinism&lt;/a&gt;, although historian Malcolm Hardman says this was a description borne \"more of irritation than accuracy\". At the end of the Civil War, Lord Derby was tried as a traitor at Chester and condemned to death. When his appeal for pardon to parliament was rejected he attempted to escape but was recaptured and executed for his part in the massacre outside Ye Olde Man &amp; Scythe Inn on 15 October 1651.\nIndustrial revolution onward.\nA tradition of cottage spinning and weaving and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Arkwright\"&gt;Richard Arkwright&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Crompton\"&gt;Samuel Crompton&lt;/a&gt;, led to rapid growth of the textile industry in the 19th century. Crompton, whilst living at &lt;a href=\"Hall%20i%27%20th%27%20Wood\"&gt;Hall i' th' Wood&lt;/a&gt;, invented the &lt;a href=\"spinning%20mule\"&gt;spinning mule&lt;/a&gt; in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding &lt;a href=\"moorland\"&gt;moorland&lt;/a&gt; into the River Croal provided the water necessary for the &lt;a href=\"bleach\"&gt;bleach&lt;/a&gt; works that were a feature of this area. Bleaching using &lt;a href=\"chlorine\"&gt;chlorine&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in the 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the &lt;a href=\"Lever%20Bank%20Bleach%20Works\"&gt;Lever Bank Bleach Works&lt;/a&gt; in the Irwell Valley. The mule revolutionised cotton spinning by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright's water frame with the carriage drafting and spindle tip twisting of &lt;a href=\"James%20Hargreaves\"&gt;James Hargreaves&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"spinning%20jenny\"&gt;spinning jenny&lt;/a&gt;, producing a high quality yarn. Self-acting mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn. The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Bridge\"&gt;Barrow Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, but steam power led to the construction of the large multi-storey mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton's skyline, some of which survive today.\nGrowth of the textile industry was assisted by the availability of coal in the area. By 1896 John Fletcher had coal mines at &lt;a href=\"Ladyshore%20Colliery\"&gt;Ladyshore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Lever\"&gt;Little Lever&lt;/a&gt;; The Earl of Bradford had a coal mine at &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lever\"&gt;Great Lever&lt;/a&gt;; the Darcy Lever Coal Company had mines at &lt;a href=\"Darcy%20Lever\"&gt;Darcy Lever&lt;/a&gt; and there were coal mines at &lt;a href=\"Tonge%2C%20Bolton\"&gt;Tonge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breightmet\"&gt;Breightmet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deane%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Deane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doffcocker\"&gt;Doffcocker&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these pits were close to the &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Bolton%20%26amp%3B%20Bury%20Canal\"&gt;Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal&lt;/a&gt; providing the owners with markets in Bolton and Manchester. Coal mining declined in the 20th century.\nImportant transport links contributed to the growth of the town and the textile industry; the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal constructed in 1791, connected the town to &lt;a href=\"Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Bury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; providing transport for coal and other basic materials. The &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20and%20Leigh%20Railway\"&gt;Bolton and Leigh Railway&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest in Lancashire, opened to goods traffic in 1828 and &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Great%20Moor%20Street%20railway%20station\"&gt;Great Moor Street station&lt;/a&gt; opened to passengers in 1831. The railway initially connected Bolton to the &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20and%20Liverpool%20Canal\"&gt;Leeds and Liverpool Canal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Leigh%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Leigh&lt;/a&gt;, an important link with the &lt;a href=\"port%20of%20Liverpool\"&gt;port of Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; for the import of raw &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; from America, but was extended in 1829 to link up with the &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20to%20Liverpool%20Line\"&gt;Manchester to Liverpool Line&lt;/a&gt;. Local firms built locomotives for the railway, in 1830 \"Union\" was built by &lt;a href=\"Rothwell%2C%20Hick%20and%20Rothwell\"&gt;Rothwell, Hick and Company&lt;/a&gt; and two locomotives, \"Salamander\" and \"Veteran\" were built by Crook and Dean.\nBolton's first Mayor, Charles James Darbishire was sympathetic to &lt;a href=\"Chartism\"&gt;Chartism&lt;/a&gt; and a supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Corn%20Law%20League\"&gt;Anti-Corn Law League&lt;/a&gt;. In August 1839 Bolton was besieged by Chartist rioters and the &lt;a href=\"Riot%20Act\"&gt;Riot Act&lt;/a&gt; was read and special constables sworn in. The mayor accompanied soldiers called to rescue special constables at &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bolton%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Little Bolton Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;, which was besieged by a mob, and the incident ended without bloodshed. &lt;a href=\"Derby%20Barracks%2C%20Bolton\"&gt;Derby Barracks&lt;/a&gt; was established in Fletcher Street in the early 1860s.\nOne of two statues prominent on Victoria Square near &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Bolton Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; is that of &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Taylor%20Chadwick\"&gt;Samuel Taylor Chadwick&lt;/a&gt; (1809 \u2013 3 May 1876) a &lt;a href=\"philanthropist\"&gt;philanthropist&lt;/a&gt; who donated funds to &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20General%20Hospital\"&gt;Bolton Hospital&lt;/a&gt; to create an ear, nose and throat ward. Built houses for people living in cellars, through Bolton Council fought for better public health including cleaner water, established the Chadwick Orphanage, improved the Bolton &lt;a href=\"Workhouse\"&gt;Workhouse&lt;/a&gt; and funded the towns natural history museum that was the basis of the present &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Museum\"&gt;Bolton Museum&lt;/a&gt; at Le Mans Crescent, the original museum was in a building at &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Park%2C%20Bolton\"&gt;Queens Park&lt;/a&gt;. The second statue at Victoria Square is in memory of a former Bolton Mayor &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Alfred%20Dobson\"&gt;Sir Benjamin Alfred Dobson&lt;/a&gt; (1847\u20131898) who died in office in 1898, he was a textile machinery manufacturer and chairman of &lt;a href=\"Dobson%20%26amp%3B%20Barlow\"&gt;Dobson &amp; Barlow&lt;/a&gt;, a significant employer in the town. By 1900 Bolton was Lancashire's third largest engineering centre after Manchester and Oldham. About 9,000 men were employed in the industry, half of them working for Dobson and Barlow in Kay Street.\nAnother engineering company &lt;a href=\"Hick%2C%20Hargreaves%20%26amp%3B%20Co\"&gt;Hick, Hargreaves &amp; Co&lt;/a&gt; based at the Soho Foundry made Lancashire boilers and heavy machinery. &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Ryder%20and%20Son\"&gt;Thomas Ryder and Son&lt;/a&gt; of Turner Bridge manufactured machine tools for the international motor industry. &lt;a href=\"Wrought%20iron\"&gt;Wrought iron&lt;/a&gt; was produced for more than 100 years at &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Walmsley%20and%20Sons\"&gt;Thomas Walmsley and Sons&lt;/a&gt;' Atlas Forge.\nBy 1911 the textile industry in Bolton employed about 36,000 people. As of 1920, the &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Cardroom%20Union\"&gt;Bolton Cardroom Union&lt;/a&gt; had more than 15,000 members, while the &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Weavers%27%20Association\"&gt;Bolton Weavers' Association&lt;/a&gt; represented 13,500 workers. The last mill to be constructed was Sir John Holden's Mill in 1927. The cotton industry declined from the 1920s. A brief upturn after the Second World War was not sustained, and the industry had virtually vanished by the end of the 20th century.\nDuring the night of 26 September 1916, Bolton was the target for an aerial offensive. L21, a &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin\"&gt;Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; commanded by &lt;a href=\"Oberleutnant\"&gt;Oberleutnant&lt;/a&gt; Kurt Frankenburg of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20German%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial German Navy&lt;/a&gt;, dropped twenty-one bombs on the town, five of them on the working class area of Kirk Street, killing thirteen residents and destroying six houses. Further attacks followed on other parts of the town, including three incendiaries dropped close to the Town Hall.\nLord Leverhulme.\nIn 1899 William Lever, &lt;a href=\"William%20Lever%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Leverhulme\"&gt;Lord Leverhulme&lt;/a&gt;, bought Hall i'th' Wood as a memorial to Samuel Crompton inventor of the spinning mule. Lever restored the dilapidated building and presented it to the town in 1902, having turned it into a museum furnished with household goods typical of domestic family life in the 16th and 17th centuries. Lever re-endowed &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20School\"&gt;Bolton School&lt;/a&gt;s, giving land and his house on Chorley New Road. He presented the town with of land for a public park which the corporation named &lt;a href=\"Leverhulme%20Park\"&gt;Leverhulme Park&lt;/a&gt; in 1914. In 1902 he gave the people of Bolton Lever Park at &lt;a href=\"Rivington\"&gt;Rivington&lt;/a&gt;. In 1911, Lever consulted &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Mawson\"&gt;Thomas Mawson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"landscape%20architect\"&gt;landscape architect&lt;/a&gt; and lecturer in Landscape Design at the University of Liverpool, regarding &lt;a href=\"town%20planning\"&gt;town planning&lt;/a&gt; in Bolton. Mawson published \"Bolton \u2013 a Study in Town Planning and Civic Art\" and gave lectures entitled \"Bolton Housing and Town Planning Society\" which formed the basis of an illustrated book \"Bolton \u2013 as it is and as it might be\". In 1924, Leverhulme presented Bolton Council with an ambitious plan to rebuild the town centre based on Mawson's designs funded partly by himself. The council declined in favour of extending the town hall and building the civic centre.\nGovernance.\nLying within the county boundaries of &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, until the early 19th century, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bolton\"&gt;Great Bolton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bolton\"&gt;Little Bolton&lt;/a&gt; were two of the eighteen &lt;a href=\"Township%20%28England%29\"&gt;township&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Parish\"&gt;ecclesiastical parish&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20le%20Moors\"&gt;Bolton le Moors&lt;/a&gt;. These townships were separated by the &lt;a href=\"River%20Croal\"&gt;River Croal&lt;/a&gt;, Little Bolton on the north bank and Great Bolton on the south. Bolton &lt;a href=\"Poor%20Law%20Union\"&gt;Poor Law Union&lt;/a&gt; was formed on 1 February 1837. It continued using existing poorhouses at Fletcher Street and Turton but in 1856 started to build a new &lt;a href=\"workhouse\"&gt;workhouse&lt;/a&gt; at Fishpool Farm in Farnworth. Townleys Hospital was built on the site which is now &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Bolton%20Hospital\"&gt;Royal Bolton Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1838 Great Bolton, most of Little Bolton and the Haulgh area of &lt;a href=\"Tonge%20with%20Haulgh\"&gt;Tonge with Haulgh&lt;/a&gt; were incorporated under the &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20Corporations%20Act%201835\"&gt;Municipal Corporations Act 1835&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"municipal%20borough\"&gt;municipal borough&lt;/a&gt;, the second to be created in England. Further additions were made adding part of &lt;a href=\"Rumworth\"&gt;Rumworth&lt;/a&gt; in 1872 and part of &lt;a href=\"Halliwell%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Halliwell&lt;/a&gt; in 1877. In 1889 Bolton was granted &lt;a href=\"County%20Borough\"&gt;County Borough&lt;/a&gt; status and became self-governing and independent from &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20County%20Council\"&gt;Lancashire County Council&lt;/a&gt; jurisdiction. In 1898, the borough was extended further by adding the &lt;a href=\"civil%20parishes%20in%20England\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt;es of Breightmet, Darcy Lever, Great Lever, the rest of Halliwell, &lt;a href=\"Heaton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Heaton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lostock%2C%20Bolton\"&gt;Lostock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Hulton\"&gt;Middle Hulton&lt;/a&gt;, the rest of Rumworth which had been renamed Deane in 1894, Smithills, and Tonge plus Astley Bridge Urban District, and part of &lt;a href=\"Over%20Hulton\"&gt;Over Hulton&lt;/a&gt; civil parish. The &lt;a href=\"County%20Borough%20of%20Bolton\"&gt;County Borough of Bolton&lt;/a&gt; was abolished in 1974 and became a constituent part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in Greater Manchester. Bolton unsuccessfully applied for city status in 2011.\n&lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Metropolitan%20Borough%20Council\"&gt;Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council&lt;/a&gt; is divided into twenty wards, each of which elects three councillors for a term of up to four years.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Act%201832\"&gt;Reform Act of 1832&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Parliamentary%20Borough\"&gt;Parliamentary Borough&lt;/a&gt; was established. The &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Bolton constituency&lt;/a&gt; was represented by two &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Members of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (MPs). The Parliamentary Borough continued until 1950 when it was abolished and replaced with two parliamentary constituencies, &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Bolton East&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20West%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Bolton West&lt;/a&gt;, each with one Member of Parliament. In 1983 Bolton East was abolished and two new constituencies were created, &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20North%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Bolton North East&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20South%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Bolton South East&lt;/a&gt; covering most of the former &lt;a href=\"Farnworth%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Farnworth constituency&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time major boundary changes also took place to Bolton West, which took over most of the former &lt;a href=\"Westhoughton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Westhoughton constituency&lt;/a&gt;. Under the &lt;a href=\"town%20twinning\"&gt;town twinning&lt;/a&gt; scheme the local council have twinned Bolton with &lt;a href=\"Le%20Mans\"&gt;Le Mans&lt;/a&gt; in France, since 1967, and &lt;a href=\"Paderborn\"&gt;Paderborn&lt;/a&gt; in Germany, since 1975.\nGeography.\nThe early name, Bolton le Moors, described the position of the town amid the low hills on the edge of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Pennine%20Moors\"&gt;West Pennine Moors&lt;/a&gt; southeast of &lt;a href=\"Rivington%20Pike\"&gt;Rivington Pike&lt;/a&gt; (456 m). Bolton lies on relatively flat land on both sides of the clough or steep-banked valley through which the &lt;a href=\"River%20Croal\"&gt;River Croal&lt;/a&gt; flows in a southeasterly direction towards the &lt;a href=\"River%20Irwell\"&gt;River Irwell&lt;/a&gt;.
