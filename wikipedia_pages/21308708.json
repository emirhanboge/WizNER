The school organises a three-day Interart, the \"Vikram Sarabhai International Arts Festival\" at Ahmedabad, every year. It celebrated its golden jubilee on 28 December 1998, with the announcement of the annual \"Mrinalini Sarabhai Award for Classical Excellence\", in the field of classical dance.\nNaming.\nWhile \"darpana\" is the &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt; word for \"mirror\", the use here also references the \"Abhinaya Darpana\", \"The Mirror of Gestures\", &lt;a href=\"Nandikeshvara\"&gt;Nandikeshvara&lt;/a&gt;'s ancient text upon Indian stage-craft and dance.\nHistory.\nThe Darpana Academy of Performing Arts was founded in Ahmedabad, &lt;a href=\"Gujarat\"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Vikram%20Sarabhai\"&gt;Vikram Sarabhai&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href=\"Mrinalini%20Sarabhai\"&gt;Mrinalini Sarabhai&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe work in using arts foe social change began at Darpana in the 1960s. Darpana\u2019s puppeteers started working with the central ministry of rural development in teaching village women the use of smokeless stove. The theatre department then run by &lt;a href=\"Kailash%20Pandya\"&gt;Kailash Pandya&lt;/a&gt; created a play called Ma to rally people to the war effort. &lt;a href=\"Mrinalini%20Sarabhai\"&gt;Mrinalini Sarabhai&lt;/a&gt;, in a radical departure from the spiritual core of the classical &lt;a href=\"Bharat%20Natyam\"&gt;Bharat Natyam&lt;/a&gt; used the style to talk of the horror of dowry violence. Over the years two departments were established to focus the work of using the arts for change. Darpana for Dvelopment in 1980, today run by actor activist &lt;a href=\"Jignesh%20Patel\"&gt;Jignesh Patel&lt;/a&gt;, and Darpana Communication in 2001 run by film maker Yadavan Chandran.

They have been able to effectively talk about a range of sensitive issues from &lt;a href=\"women%20and%20violence\"&gt;women and violence&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"religious%20intolerance\"&gt;religious intolerance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Natural%20environment\"&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"corruption\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"justice\"&gt;justice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe academy received &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; sponsorship to offer Artist Residency programs in 1999-2000 and 2005-2007. The academy was also listed by UNESCO an institution active in the \"Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage\", and thereby invited to attend the subsequent Intergovernmental Committee meetings.\nIn 1962, &lt;a href=\"Achyut%20Kanvinde\"&gt;Achyut Kanvinde&lt;/a&gt; was commissioned by Sarabhai to design the building of the academy.\nActivities.\nThe academy offers courses in Indian classical dance &lt;a href=\"Bharatanatyam\"&gt;Bharatanatyam&lt;/a&gt;, Indian Classical Vocal, &lt;a href=\"Mridangam\"&gt;Mridangam&lt;/a&gt;, Violin and Flute, puppetry and martial art &lt;a href=\"Kalaripayattu\"&gt;Kalaripayattu&lt;/a&gt;. Its departments range from performance and teaching of the arts, to the use of performance and arts as development communication, through face-to-face impact and software production.\nThe Drama Section, under acting duo &lt;a href=\"Kailash%20Pandya\"&gt;Kailash Pandya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Damini%20Mehta\"&gt;Damini Mehta&lt;/a&gt;, is responsible for more than 100 productions of a wide variety.\nDarpana attracted young writers and staged their first scripts, making them an integral part of production efforts.
