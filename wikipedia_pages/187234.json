The list is sorted &lt;a href=\"alphabetically\"&gt;alphabetically&lt;/a&gt; by state and includes both active and inactive clubs. These football clubs are all associated with the &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Football%20Confederation\"&gt;Brazilian Football Confederation&lt;/a&gt;. As with many other football leagues, the structure has changed frequently, including its implementation of the same configuration of European leagues in 2003."
