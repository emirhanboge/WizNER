    "title": "Bay of Sails",
    "text": "Bay of Sails () is a shallow indentation in the coast of &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Land\"&gt;Victoria Land&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Spike%20Cape\"&gt;Spike Cape&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gneiss%20Point\"&gt;Gneiss Point&lt;/a&gt;. The bay is the end point of &lt;a href=\"Scheuren%20Stream\"&gt;Scheuren Stream&lt;/a&gt;, which carries meltwater from &lt;a href=\"Wilson%20Piedmont%20Glacier\"&gt;Wilson Piedmont Glacier&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name was first suggested by the Western Geological Party of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Antarctic%20Expedition%2C%201910%E2%80%9313\"&gt;British Antarctic Expedition, 1910\u201313&lt;/a&gt;, which erected makeshift sails on their man-drawn sledge while sledging across the ice at the mouth of the bay, thereby increasing their speed."
