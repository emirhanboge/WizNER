Their route was via the Schwarztor, a pass first crossed by John Ball and Gabriel Zumtaugwald in 1845. The impressive north ridge was first climbed by Captain &lt;a href=\"John%20Percy%20Farrar\"&gt;John Percy Farrar&lt;/a&gt; (a future President of the &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20Club%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Alpine Club&lt;/a&gt;) and Wylie Lloyd with guide Josef Pollinger of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Niklaus\"&gt;St. Niklaus&lt;/a&gt; in the canton Valais on 18 August 1893.\nAscents are usually made from the &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Ottorino%20Mezzalama\"&gt;Refuge Ottorino Mezzalama&lt;/a&gt; (3,036 m), the Monte Rosa hut (2,795 m); if traversing the peaks via Pollux's north ridge, PD+, the &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Quintino%20Sella%20au%20F%C3%A9lik\"&gt;Refuge Quintino Sella au F\u00e9lik&lt;/a&gt; (3,585 m), and the Rossi-Volante bivouac hut (3,850 m).\nThe first winter and ski ascent of Pollux was by Dr Alfred von Martin and Karl Planck on 7 March 1913."
