    "text": "Laurensio Segundo Mercado (born 5 January 1967) is a retired male &lt;a href=\"Boxing\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;.\nMercado represented Ecuador at the &lt;a href=\"1988%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1988 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, losing on points in the &lt;a href=\"Boxing%20at%20the%201988%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;boxing competition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Kitel\"&gt;Martin Kitel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. He turned professional after the games and, fighting as a &lt;a href=\"middleweight\"&gt;middleweight&lt;/a&gt;, built up a record of 18-2.\nOn 17 December 1994, Mercado was matched against future &lt;a href=\"Undisputed%20championship%20%28boxing%29\"&gt;undisputed&lt;/a&gt; middleweight champion &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Hopkins\"&gt;Bernard Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; for the vacant &lt;a href=\"International%20Boxing%20Federation\"&gt;IBF&lt;/a&gt; middleweight title in &lt;a href=\"Quito%2C%20Ecuador\"&gt;Quito, Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;. Attempting to become his country's first ever world boxing champion, Mercado knocked Hopkins down twice, but the fight was scored a controversial &lt;a href=\"split%20draw\"&gt;split draw&lt;/a&gt;. They met again four months later, and this time Hopkins won via a seventh round &lt;a href=\"Knockout\"&gt;technical knockout&lt;/a&gt;.\nMercado moved up to the &lt;a href=\"super-middleweight\"&gt;super-middleweight&lt;/a&gt; division after losing to Hopkins, and challenged &lt;a href=\"World%20Boxing%20Association\"&gt;WBA&lt;/a&gt; super-middleweight champion &lt;a href=\"Frankie%20Liles\"&gt;Frankie Liles&lt;/a&gt;; Mercado was stopped in five rounds. Mercado continued boxing, but failed to win another fight and retired in 2003 with a final record of 19-10-2."
