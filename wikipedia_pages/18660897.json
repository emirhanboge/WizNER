    "text": "A seep or flush is a moist or wet place where &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, usually &lt;a href=\"groundwater\"&gt;groundwater&lt;/a&gt;, reaches the earth's surface from an underground &lt;a href=\"aquifer\"&gt;aquifer&lt;/a&gt;. \nDescription.\nSeeps are usually not of sufficient volume to be flowing beyond their above-ground location. They are part of the &lt;a href=\"limnology\"&gt;limnology&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"geomorphology\"&gt;geomorphology&lt;/a&gt; system. Like a higher volume &lt;a href=\"spring%20%28hydrosphere%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;, the water is only from underground sources. Seeps mostly occur in lower elevation areas because water runs downhill, but can happen higher up if the groundwater present is abundant enough. Along with natural seeps, man made seeps can occur by digging anywhere where there is wet ground. This method can be useful for survival purposes and helps the local wildlife by adding another water source to the area.\nSeeps often form a &lt;a href=\"puddle\"&gt;puddle&lt;/a&gt;, and are important for small &lt;a href=\"wildlife\"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"butterfly\"&gt;butterfly&lt;/a&gt; habitat and moisture needs. When they support &lt;a href=\"mud-puddling\"&gt;mud-puddling&lt;/a&gt; many butterfly (\"&lt;a href=\"Lepidoptera\"&gt;Lepidoptera&lt;/a&gt;\") species can obtain &lt;a href=\"nutrient\"&gt;nutrient&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"salt%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"amino%20acid\"&gt;amino acid&lt;/a&gt;s, including some types that are &lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"endangered%20species\"&gt;endangered species&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnvironmental technology.\nSeep is often used in environmental sciences to define an exfiltration zone (seepage zone) where contaminated water, e.g., from waste dumps, leaves a waste system area.\nSeeps are often important smaller wildlife water sources, and indicated by lower &lt;a href=\"riparian\"&gt;riparian&lt;/a&gt; vegetation.\nStream recharge system.\nSeeps can also contribute to streams. If a stream is flowing below a &lt;a href=\"water%20table\"&gt;water table&lt;/a&gt; then the stream receives contributions from the ground water via &lt;a href=\"seepage\"&gt;seepage&lt;/a&gt;. This allows for a drainage of the ground water along with creating a more substantial stream to flow. The seep could be especially effective during a rain less period of the area in which the seep can actually prolong the stream\u2019s flow by adding water from the groundwater."
