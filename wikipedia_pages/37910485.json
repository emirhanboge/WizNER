    "text": "J\u00fcrgen Klaus Hennig (born in &lt;a href=\"Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; on March 5, 1951) is a German &lt;a href=\"chemist\"&gt;chemist&lt;/a&gt; and medical physicist. Internationally he is considered to be one of the pioneers of &lt;a href=\"Magnetic%20Resonance%20Imaging\"&gt;Magnetic Resonance Imaging&lt;/a&gt; for clinical diagnostics. He is the Scientific Director of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Chairman of the Magnetic Resonance Development and Application Center (MRDAC) at the &lt;a href=\"University%20Medical%20Center%20Freiburg\"&gt;University Medical Center Freiburg&lt;/a&gt;. In the year 2003 he was awarded the in the category of Biosciences and Medicine.\nBiography.\nScientific career.\nFrom 1969 to 1977 Hennig studied chemistry in &lt;a href=\"Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freiburg\"&gt;Freiburg&lt;/a&gt;. During the years from 1977 to 1981 he was employed as a scientist at the Institute for Physical Chemistry (IPC) of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Freiburg\"&gt;University of Freiburg&lt;/a&gt;, where he completed his doctoral degree on NMR measurements of intramolecular exchange kinetics under the supervision of Herbert Zimmermann. During this time Hennig first came into contact with &lt;a href=\"Magnetic%20Resonance%20Imaging\"&gt;Magnetic Resonance Imaging&lt;/a&gt; (MRI) at the inaugural lecture of his advisor Hans-Heinrich Limbach on the work of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Lauterbur\"&gt;Paul Lauterbur&lt;/a&gt;, a subsequent winner of the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1982 to 1983 Hennig was a post-doctoral student at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Zurich\"&gt;University of Zurich&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked in the area of &lt;a href=\"CIDNP\"&gt;CIDNP&lt;/a&gt; Spectroscopy. In 1982 he developed his first own &lt;a href=\"NMR\"&gt;NMR&lt;/a&gt; pulse sequence to measure intramolecular exchange processes. During his time in Zurich Hennig decided to focus his future work in the area of &lt;a href=\"NMR\"&gt;NMR&lt;/a&gt; method development with less focus on chemistry.\nHennig began his work at the &lt;a href=\"University%20Medical%20Center%20Freiburg\"&gt;University Medical Center Freiburg&lt;/a&gt; in 1984 as a scientific researcher in the Department of Diagnostic Radiology. There, in cooperation with the company &lt;a href=\"Bruker\"&gt;Bruker Medizintechnik GmbH&lt;/a&gt;, he developed the RARE-Method. In the year 1989 he completed his professorial thesis of \u201cSpecial Imaging Techniques for the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Tomography\u201d at the Medical Faculty of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Freiburg\"&gt;University of Freiburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the year 1993, Hennig was appointed a professorship at the &lt;a href=\"University%20Medical%20Center%20Freiburg\"&gt;University Medical Center Freiburg&lt;/a&gt; as the head of the MR Tomography work group in the Department of Diagnostic Radiology. In 1998 he was designated as the Director of the Department of Imaging and Functional Medical Physics of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology. In 2001 he became Research Director of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology. In the same year he founded the Magnetic Resonance Development and Application Center (MRDAC) at the &lt;a href=\"University%20Medical%20Center%20Freiburg\"&gt;University Medical Center Freiburg&lt;/a&gt;. A cooptation at the School of Mathematics and Physics of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Freiburg\"&gt;University of Freiburg&lt;/a&gt; followed in the year 2002.\nIn 2004 Hennig was appointed C4-&lt;a href=\"Professor\"&gt;Professor&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20Medical%20Center%20Freiburg\"&gt;University Medical Center Freiburg&lt;/a&gt; and since then he is the Scientific Director of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology. The research group for research and development in MRI that he founded and headed since 1984 grew to approximately 80 employees by the end of 2012.\nIn 1999 Hennig was the President of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Society%20for%20Magnetic%20Resonance%20in%20Medicine\"&gt;International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (ISMRM). \nSince 2008 he has been a joint affiliate to the Wisconsin Institute for Medical Research at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 2011 he has been a member of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20Leopoldina\"&gt;German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorks.\nHennig has written numerous fundamental research papers on the development of &lt;a href=\"Magnetic%20Resonance%20Imaging\"&gt;Magnetic Resonance Imaging&lt;/a&gt; (MRI).\nBased on the CPMG multi-echo method, Hennig developed the RARE Sequence (Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement) in 1984. Through his work the MR image acquisition time could be significantly reduced, which constituted an important step for its use in clinical routine. In addition, RARE offered the possibility to control the diagnostically relevant T2 contrast in MRI. The RARE method was first published in 1984 in the German journal \u201cDer Radiologe\u201d. His first submission to an international journal was rejected, with the comment that this method had already been tested and wouldn\u2019t work. In the year 1986 international publications followed. RARE is currently one of the standard methods used in clinical &lt;a href=\"MRI\"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;. The method is also known by the acronyms TSE (Turbo Spin Echo) and FSE (Fast Spin Echo).\nThe Hyperecho method was published by Hennig in 2001. With hyperechoes the &lt;a href=\"Specific%20absorption%20rate\"&gt;Specific absorption rate&lt;/a&gt; (SAR) of a RARE sequence can be significantly reduced while the image quality is almost completely maintained. This is important for clinical &lt;a href=\"MRI\"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; applications at high &lt;a href=\"magnetic%20field\"&gt;magnetic field&lt;/a&gt; strengths.\nIn 2008 Hennig published a concept for imaging with non-linear magnetic field gradients which allows increasing the &lt;a href=\"image%20resolution\"&gt;image resolution&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"brain\"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"MRI\"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; in the outer image regions.\nHe and his team also organize educative workshops under support of ESMRMB.\nConnections to Asia.\nIn the year 1985 Hennig travelled to &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, China in order to set up one of the first &lt;a href=\"MRI\"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; systems in China. With this the first MR image was taken in China on December 25, 1985. Since then he has attended other MRI system installations in China.\nHennig has been president and founding member of the European-Chinese Society for Clinical Magnetic Resonance since 1993. He is honorary member of the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Radiological%20Society\"&gt;Chinese Radiological Society&lt;/a&gt;. Hennig was awarded \u201cEinstein Professor\u201d of the Chinese Academy of Science in 2011. In 2010 he received the , which is the highest scientific award of &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 2004 Hennig is a member of the Academy of Science of the Republic of &lt;a href=\"Tatarstan\"&gt;Tatarstan&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, he maintains cooperations with Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore."
