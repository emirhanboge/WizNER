    "text": "The Valdostan Union (, UV), also Valdostian Union or Valdotanian Union is a &lt;a href=\"Regionalism%20%28politics%29\"&gt;regionalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"centrism\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Aosta%20Valley\"&gt;political party&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aosta%20Valley\"&gt;Aosta Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. It represents mainly the &lt;a href=\"Arpitan%20language\"&gt;Arpitan-speaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Political%20parties%20of%20minorities\"&gt;minority&lt;/a&gt; in the region, and its leader is &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Lav%C3%A9vaz\"&gt;Erik Lav\u00e9vaz&lt;/a&gt;, party president and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Aosta%20Valley\"&gt;President of Aosta Valley&lt;/a&gt; since 2020.\nThe UV has been steadily represented in the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Parliament\"&gt;Italian Parliament&lt;/a&gt; since 1976 and, due to the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democracy%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Christian Democracy&lt;/a&gt; party in the early 1990s, it has become the &lt;a href=\"big%20tent\"&gt;catch-all party&lt;/a&gt; of the region, similarly to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Tyrolean%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;South Tyrolean People's Party&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Tyrol\"&gt;South Tyrol&lt;/a&gt;. The party steadily increased its share of vote from the 11.6% of 1973 to the 47.2% of 2003, then it started a decline and was riven by splits. However, it has led the regional government almost with no interruption since 1974.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe UV was founded by Valdostan elements of the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20resistance%20movement\"&gt;Italian resistance movement&lt;/a&gt; on 3 September 1945.\nThe party was originally a close ally of the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democracy%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Christian Democracy&lt;/a&gt; (DC), with which it shared government between 1946 and &lt;a href=\"1954%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;1954&lt;/a&gt; under Severino Caveri (UV). After that, the party distanced itself from the DC, while approaching the left-wing.\nAfter a five years' spell in opposition, the UV won the &lt;a href=\"1959%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;1959 regional election&lt;/a&gt; in coalition with the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Italian Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; (PCI) and the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Italian Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; (PSI) with 51.6% against the 48.6% of an alternative coalition comprising the DC, the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Italian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; (PLI), the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Democratic%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Italian Democratic Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; (PSDI) and the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Republican%20Party\"&gt;Italian Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; (PRI).\nThe UV\u2013PCI\u2013PSI coalition, led by UV's &lt;a href=\"Oreste%20Marcoz\"&gt;Oreste Marcoz&lt;/a&gt; (1959\u20131963) and then, again, Caveri (since 1963), governed until 1966, when the Socialists decided to switch sides and to enter in coalition with the DC, as they had done at the country-level three years before. This caused the split of UV's &lt;a href=\"conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; faction, which established the &lt;a href=\"Valdostan%20Rally\"&gt;Valdostan Rally&lt;/a&gt; (RV), in order to support the coalition led by DC's &lt;a href=\"Cesare%20Bondaz\"&gt;Cesare Bondaz&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"1968%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;1968 regional election&lt;/a&gt; the UV received a mere 16.7% of the vote (the RV got 5.4%), while in &lt;a href=\"1973%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;1973 Valdostan regional election&lt;/a&gt;, after the split of the &lt;a href=\"social%20democracy\"&gt;social-democratic&lt;/a&gt; faction, the &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Valdostan%20Union%20%281973%29\"&gt;Progressive Valdostan Union&lt;/a&gt; (UVP), it was reduced at 11.6% (the UPV obtained 6.7% and the RV 1.6%, while the &lt;a href=\"Popular%20Democrats\"&gt;Popular Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, a left-wing split of the DC, won 22.4%). After that low point, the UV was ready to surge again.\nResurgence.\nThe UV returned to government in 1974 at the head of a UV\u2013UVP\u2013RV regionalist coalition led by &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Andrione\"&gt;Mario Andrione&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"1978%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;1978 regional election&lt;/a&gt; the UV returned to be the largest party with 24.7% of the vote and Andrione formed a government with the DC and the DP. In 1984 Andrione was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Augusto%20Rollandin\"&gt;Augusto Rollandin&lt;/a&gt; at the head of the government, which included the DC and the &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Democratic%20Autonomists\"&gt;Progressive Democratic Autonomists&lt;/a&gt; (ADP), born by the merger of the DP and the UVP. During the 1980s the UV strengthened its role as largest party in the region: 27.1% in &lt;a href=\"1983%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt; and 34.2% in &lt;a href=\"1988%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;. Since the 1970s the UV was steadily represented in the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Parliament\"&gt;Italian Parliament&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Fosson\"&gt;Pierre Fosson&lt;/a&gt; was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20the%20Republic%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; from 1976 to 1987, while &lt;a href=\"Luciano%20Caveri\"&gt;Luciano Caveri&lt;/a&gt; (scion of the party's left-wing) represented the UV in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; from 1987 to 2001. Caveri served also as undersecretary in &lt;a href=\"D%27Alema%20II%20Cabinet\"&gt;D'Alema II Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; and as &lt;a href=\"member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament\"&gt;member of the European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; from 2000 to 2003.\nAfter having been excluded from government for three years and from the leadership of the region for three years, the UV was back in government in 1992 and, after the &lt;a href=\"1993%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;1993 regional election&lt;/a&gt;, UV's &lt;a href=\"Dino%20Vi%C3%A9rin\"&gt;Dino Vi\u00e9rin&lt;/a&gt; formed a centre-left cabinet with the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20the%20Left\"&gt;Democratic Party of the Left&lt;/a&gt; (PDS), the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20the%20Greens\"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt; and the ADP (since 1994). The coalition was continued in 1998\u20132006 by the UV and the &lt;a href=\"Democrats%20of%20the%20Left\"&gt;Democrats of the Left&lt;/a&gt; (DS), while Rollandin served as senator in 2001\u20132006. Despite its ties with the parties of the centre-left, the UV contested the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Italian%20general%20election\"&gt;2006 general election&lt;/a&gt; in competition with &lt;a href=\"The%20Union%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;The Union&lt;/a&gt; (rallied in the &lt;a href=\"Autonomy%20Liberty%20Participation%20Ecology\"&gt;Autonomy Liberty Democracy&lt;/a&gt; list), as part of the regionalist coalition named &lt;a href=\"Aosta%20Valley%20%28political%20coalition%29\"&gt;Aosta Valley&lt;/a&gt;, causing the split of the &lt;a href=\"Valdostan%20Renewal\"&gt;Valdostan Renewal&lt;/a&gt; (RV), but lost and was no more represented in Parliament. This was however a turning point in regional politics: the UV dismissed the DS as coalition partners and formed a regionalist three-party coalition with &lt;a href=\"Edelweiss%20%28political%20party%29\"&gt;Edelweiss&lt;/a&gt; (SA) and the &lt;a href=\"Autonomist%20Federation\"&gt;Autonomist Federation&lt;/a&gt; (FA).\nRegionalist coalition.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;2008 regional election&lt;/a&gt; the UV won 44.4% of the vote and 17 regional councillors (out of 35), while the regionalist coalition won 62.0% and a large majority, composed of 22 regional councillors. &lt;a href=\"Augusto%20Rollandin\"&gt;Augusto Rollandin&lt;/a&gt;, who had made a comeback to regional politics, was the most voted regional councillor with 13,836 preference votes, while incumbent President &lt;a href=\"Luciano%20Caveri\"&gt;Luciano Caveri&lt;/a&gt; was only seventh with 2,770 votes (down from 7,313). Rollandin was thus sworn in as new President of the Region. Contextually, UV's &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Fosson\"&gt;Antonio Fosson&lt;/a&gt; had been elected to the Senate for the regionalist coalition: Fosson joined the &lt;a href=\"For%20the%20Autonomies\"&gt;For the Autonomies&lt;/a&gt; group and abstained from the vote of confidence on &lt;a href=\"Berlusconi%20IV%20Cabinet\"&gt;Berlusconi IV Cabinet&lt;/a&gt;. Both in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20European%20Parliament%20election%20in%20Aosta%20Valley\"&gt;2009 European Parliament election&lt;/a&gt; and the 2010 Aosta municipal election the UV formed an alliance with &lt;a href=\"The%20People%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;The People of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; (PdL). That alliance was however short-lived. In the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Italian%20general%20election%20in%20Aosta%20Valley\"&gt;2013 general election&lt;/a&gt; UV's &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Lani%C3%A8ce\"&gt;Albert Lani\u00e8ce&lt;/a&gt; was elected to the Senate with support from the PdL.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;2013 regional election&lt;/a&gt; the UV, which had suffered the split of the new &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Valdostan%20Union%20%282013%29\"&gt;Progressive Valdostan Union&lt;/a&gt; (UVP), obtained 33.5% of the vote (\u201310.9pp from 2008) and 13 seats, and the regionalist coalition retained a narrow majority in the Regional Council. Rollandin was the most voted politician with 10,872 preference votes (2,964 less than five years before) and was re-elected president. In July 2015 the government was enlarged to the centre-left &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (PD). In June 2016, after months of negotiations, the government was joined also by the UVP. In November 2016 two regional councillors, including former senator Fosson, left the party in disagreement with Rollandin and launched &lt;a href=\"For%20Our%20Valley\"&gt;For Our Valley&lt;/a&gt; (PNV). In March 2017 the UVP, SA (which had suffered the split of the &lt;a href=\"Valdostan%20Autonomist%20Popular%20Edelweiss\"&gt;Valdostan Autonomist Popular Edelweiss&lt;/a&gt; (EPAV), PNV and &lt;a href=\"Autonomy%20Liberty%20Participation%20Ecology\"&gt;Autonomy Liberty Participation Ecology&lt;/a&gt; (ALPE) formed a new government without the UV, under President &lt;a href=\"Pierluigi%20Marquis\"&gt;Pierluigi Marquis&lt;/a&gt; (SA). In October Marquis resigned and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Laurent%20Vi%C3%A9rin\"&gt;Laurent Vi\u00e9rin&lt;/a&gt; (UVP) at the head of a coalition composed of the UV, the UVP, the EPAV and the PD.\nCentre-left coalition.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Italian%20general%20election%20in%20Aosta%20Valley\"&gt;2018 general election&lt;/a&gt;, Lani\u00e8ce was narrowly re-elected to the Senate, but the four-party coalition forming the regional government lost several votes and the seat in the Chamber. In the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;2018 regional election&lt;/a&gt; the UV did even worse, obtaining 19.2% of the vote (\u201314.3pp from 2013) and seven seats: its worst result in 45 years. After the election, the Regional Council elected &lt;a href=\"Nicoletta%20Spelgatti\"&gt;Nicoletta Spelgatti&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lega%20Nord%20Valle%20d%27Aosta\"&gt;Lega Nord Valle d'Aosta&lt;/a&gt; (LNVdA) as President, at the head of a broad left-right coalition (including one defector from UV's ranks, outgoing regional minister &lt;a href=\"Emily%20Rini\"&gt;Emily Rini&lt;/a&gt;), and the UV was once again excluded from the regional government. However, in December the government fell down and was replaced by a new one led by &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Fosson\"&gt;Antonio Fosson&lt;/a&gt; (ex UV, then PNV), at the head of a coalition composed of the UV, the UVP, ALPE, SA and PNV. In December 2019 Fosson resigned from President and was replaced by his Vice President, UV's &lt;a href=\"Renzo%20Testolin\"&gt;Renzo Testolin&lt;/a&gt;, as acting president. In the &lt;a href=\"2019%20European%20Parliament%20election%20in%20Aosta%20Valley\"&gt;2019 European Parliament election&lt;/a&gt; the UV was part of a five-party regionalist joint list, which had a technical agreement with the PD and obtained a mere 13.9% of the vote. A few months later, the party also suffered the split by former President Rollandin and his followers, who formed &lt;a href=\"For%20Aosta%20Valley\"&gt;For Aosta Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Valdostan%20regional%20election\"&gt;2020 regional election&lt;/a&gt;, the UV was reduced to 15.8%, its second worst result ever, while the LNVdA came a stronger first. However, after the election, UV leader &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Lav%C3%A9vaz\"&gt;Erik Lav\u00e9vaz&lt;/a&gt; formed a government composed of the PD, &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Network\"&gt;Civic Network&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Valdostan%20Alliance\"&gt;Valdostan Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (AV) (formed by the merger of ALPE and UVP), SA and &lt;a href=\"Mouv%27%20%28political%20party%29\"&gt;Mouv'&lt;/a&gt;."
