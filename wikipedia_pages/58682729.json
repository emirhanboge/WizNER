    "text": "Greensville County Public Schools is a &lt;a href=\"school%20division\"&gt;school division&lt;/a&gt; headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Emporia%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Emporia, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, serving that city and &lt;a href=\"Greensville%20County%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Greensville County&lt;/a&gt;.\nCirca 1972 there was an effort by Emporia residents to create a separate school division. On June 22, 1972, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;United States Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; denied the creation of the district on a 5\u20134 basis, with the four dissenters having been appointed by U.S. president &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernance.\nThe district has four school board members from Greensville County and two from Emporia."
