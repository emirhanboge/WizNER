Forney was subsequently ordered back to &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt; and appointed commanding officer, U.S. Marine Corps Component, U.S. Naval Advisory Group.

While in this capacity, he had an opportunity to analyse the situation in the country and relationship between Vietnamese civilians and U.S. military. As an veteran of &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Haiti\"&gt;Haitian campaign&lt;/a&gt;, he used his own experiences and proposed that the United States operation in South Vietnam should not be tied in with the &lt;a href=\"MAAG\"&gt;MAAG&lt;/a&gt;; but rather an effort to be linked with the Civil Guard, the Self-Defense Corps, and the local Militia in the village and boondock level. This would be similar to the Guardia effort in &lt;a href=\"Nicaragua\"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt; or the Gendarmerie operation in &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santo%20Domingo\"&gt;Santo Domingo&lt;/a&gt;.\nForney met with then-Chief of Staff, &lt;a href=\"Headquarters%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;Headquarters Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt;, Lieutenant general &lt;a href=\"Wallace%20M.%20Greene\"&gt;Wallace M. Greene&lt;/a&gt; in Saigon in February 1963 and discuss his conclusions with him. Unfortunately Forney's health began failing and he was diagnosed with the cancer. He lost his fight with the illness on January 21, 1965, and died in &lt;a href=\"Letterman%20Army%20Hospital\"&gt;Letterman Army Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. He was buried with full military honors at &lt;a href=\"Arlington%20National%20Cemetery\"&gt;Arlington National Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.\nDecorations.\nHere is the ribbon bar of Brigadier General Edward H.
