His body was taken back to Toowoomba and his funeral proceeded from St Luke's Church of England Church to the &lt;a href=\"Drayton%20and%20Toowoomba%20Cemetery\"&gt;Drayton and Toowoomba Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.\nPublic career.\nRoberts was an alderman on the &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba%20City%20Council\"&gt;Toowoomba City Council&lt;/a&gt; for 10 years, including part of the time he spent in the &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20Parliament\"&gt;Queensland Parliament&lt;/a&gt;.
