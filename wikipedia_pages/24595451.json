    "text": "The statehood movement in Puerto Rico () aims to make &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Puerto Rico is an &lt;a href=\"Unincorporated%20territories%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;unincorporated territorial possession of the United States&lt;/a&gt; acquired in 1898 following the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Spanish\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt;, making it \"the oldest colony in the modern world\". As of 2019, the population of Puerto Rico is 3.2 million, around half the average state population and higher than that of 20 U.S. states. Competing &lt;a href=\"Proposed_political_status_for_Puerto_Rico\"&gt;options for the future political status of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href=\"Status%20quo%20movement%20in%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;maintaining its current status&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Independence%20movement%20in%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;becoming fully independent&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Free%20association%20movement%20in%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;becoming a freely associated state&lt;/a&gt;. Puerto Rico has held six referendums on the topic. These are non-binding, as &lt;a href=\"admission%20to%20the%20Union\"&gt;the power to grant statehood&lt;/a&gt; lies with the &lt;a href=\"US%20Congress\"&gt;US Congress&lt;/a&gt;. The most recent referendum was in &lt;a href=\"2020%20Puerto%20Rican%20status%20referendum\"&gt;November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with a majority (52.52%) of voters opting for statehood.\nAlthough the previous two referendums (November 2012 and June 2017) also had ostensibly pro-statehood outcomes, the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; described them as \"marred, with ballot language phrased to favor the party in office\".\nFor example, the fourth referendum, held in November 2012, asked voters (1) whether they wanted to maintain the current political status of Puerto Rico and, if not, (2) which alternative status they prefer.\nOf the fifty-four percent (54.0%) who voted \"No\" on maintaining the status quo, 61.11% chose statehood, 33.34% chose &lt;a href=\"Associated%20state\"&gt;free association&lt;/a&gt;, and 5.55% chose independence. Opponents of statehood argued that these results did not show that a majority of Puerto Rican voters support statehood.\nThe June 2017 referendum was, according to the New York Times, a \"flawed election\" where the turnout was only 23%, in part because most statehood opponents &lt;a href=\"Boycott\"&gt;sat out&lt;/a&gt;. 97% of votes cast favored statehood.\nThe November 2020 referendum, by contrast, was the first to ask voters a simple yes-or-no question: \"Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State?\". There were 655,505 votes in favor of statehood (52.52%) and 592,671 votes opposed (47.48%). The 55% turnout rate equaled that for the simultaneous &lt;a href=\"2020_Puerto_Rican_general_election\"&gt;2020 gubernatorial race&lt;/a&gt; and the 2016 gubernatorial race.\nBackground.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Spanish\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt;, Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States in 1898, through the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281898%29\"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt;. Puerto Rico became an &lt;a href=\"Unincorporated%20territories%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;unincorporated&lt;/a&gt;, organized territory of the US through a series of judicial decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States, collectively known as \"The Insular Cases\" and the enactment of several statutes by Congress.\nIn 1900, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; enacted the &lt;a href=\"Foraker%20Act\"&gt;Foraker Act&lt;/a&gt;, establishing a civil government in the territory and then in 1917, Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship, by the enactment of the &lt;a href=\"Jones-Shafroth%20Act%20of%201917\"&gt;Jones-Shafroth Act&lt;/a&gt;. The Office of the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for policy relations between the United States and Puerto Rico, although according to the Territorial Clause of Constitution of the United States of America \"The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States...\". In 1952, voters in Puerto Rico approved a new &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; proposed by Gov. &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Munoz%20Marin\"&gt;Luis Munoz Marin&lt;/a&gt;; this led to the territory being designated as a &lt;a href=\"commonwealth%20%28U.S.%20insular%20area%29\"&gt;commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;.\nPotential benefits of statehood.\nPuerto Rico is, by a considerable margin, the largest &lt;a href=\"Territories%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U.S. territory&lt;/a&gt; in terms of both population and geographical area, being similar to &lt;a href=\"Connecticut\"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; with respect to population size (&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20states%20and%20territories%20of%20the%20United%20States%20by%20population\"&gt;~3.3 million to CT's 3.6 million&lt;/a&gt;) and geographical area (&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20area\"&gt;13,791 square km to CT's 14,357&lt;/a&gt;). Puerto Rico residents do not participate in the Presidential elections because Puerto Rico does not have any &lt;a href=\"electoral%20votes\"&gt;electoral votes&lt;/a&gt;, but individual Puerto Ricans do have the right to vote when resident in a U.S. state or the &lt;a href=\"District%20of%20Columbia\"&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. Statehood would allow the population to vote in all elections as the residents of states already can.\nOther benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and Medicaid funding as well as the higher (federal) minimum wage.\nRepresentation.\nThe primary debate over Puerto Rican statehood is about representation. Some proposals seek to give it representation without statehood, giving it its apportioned representatives in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;Senators&lt;/a&gt; like a state without officially adding it to the union.\nWhether Puerto Rico is given statehood or simply &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20congressional%20apportionment\"&gt;apportioned&lt;/a&gt; members of Congress as a &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20%28U.S.%20insular%20area%29\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; or territory, this will have an impact on the make-up of the House. As the &lt;a href=\"Reapportionment%20Act%20of%201929\"&gt;Reapportionment Act of 1929&lt;/a&gt; mandates the House be capped at 435 members, Puerto Rico would end up with Representatives that would otherwise have been apportioned to other states. The table to the right displays the differences in calculated apportionment (using the &lt;a href=\"Huntington%E2%80%93Hill%20method\"&gt;Huntington\u2013Hill method&lt;/a&gt;) if apportionment was based on the estimated populations given by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. If only Puerto Rico was admitted, the following states would be projected to lose at least one seat: New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan.\nHistory.\nSince the transfer of sovereignty of Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States, the relationship between Puerto Rico and the US has been debated by many. On April 11, 1899, the peace treaty between Spain and the USA (the 1898 Treaty of Paris) became effective, and established a military government in Puerto Rico. This was short lived, since the following year (April 2, 1900) Congress enacted the &lt;a href=\"Foraker%20Act\"&gt;Foraker Act&lt;/a&gt;, which established a civil government and free trade between Puerto Rico and the USA. Puerto Ricans, although incapable of electing members of the territory's executive branch, but were now able to elect their local representatives and a resident commissioner to the US Congress, who had voice but no vote. In 1917, the enactment of the &lt;a href=\"Jones-Shafroth%20Act%20of%201917\"&gt;Jones-Shafroth Act&lt;/a&gt; the territory of Puerto Rico was organized and statutory US citizenship was granted to its residents.\nSince 1967, there have been &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Puerto%20Rican%20status%20referendums\"&gt;several referendums&lt;/a&gt;, which included questions on statehood. Puerto Ricans chose not to alter the status quo in referendums until 2012. The 2012 referendum produced a more equivocal result.\n1967 referendum.\nA referendum on the &lt;a href=\"Political%20status%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;status of the island&lt;/a&gt; was held in &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; on July 23, 1967. Voters were given the choice between being a Commonwealth, statehood or independence. The majority of voters voted for Commonwealth status, with a voter turnout of 65.9%.\n1998 referendum.\nA referendum in December 1998 offered voters four political status options: statehood, independence, free association, and territorial commonwealth, plus \"none of the above.\" The latter option won 50.5% of the vote, followed by statehood, with 46.6%. Turnout was 71%.\n2012 statehood vote.\nOn November 6, 2012, eligible voters in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico were presented with two questions:&lt;br&gt;\n(1) whether they agreed to continue with Puerto Rico's territorial status and (2) to indicate the political status they preferred &lt;a href=\"proposed%20political%20status%20for%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;from three possibilities&lt;/a&gt;: statehood, &lt;a href=\"Independence%20movement%20in%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Free%20association%20movement%20in%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;a sovereign nation in free association with the United States&lt;/a&gt;. Voters who chose \"No\" to the first question numbered 970,910 (54.0%), expressing themselves against continuing the current political status, while those who voted \"Yes\" numbered 828,077 (46.0%), indicating their desire to continue the current political status relationship. Of those who answered the second question, 834,191 (61.2%) chose statehood, 454,768 (33.3%) chose &lt;a href=\"Associated%20state\"&gt;free association&lt;/a&gt;, and 74,895 (5.5%) chose independence.\nThe preferred status consultation did not include Puerto Rico's current status as a territory (Estado Libre Asociado as defined by the 1952 Constitution) as a choice, but instead an alternative named \"E.L.A. Soberano\" President &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; pledged to respect the voters' decision.\nIn December 2012, the newspaper \"Caribbean Business\" allegedly obtained, from a &lt;a href=\"White%20House\"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; source, a statement claiming that Obama urged Congress to act upon the referendum's results. \nOn December 11, 2012, the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; enacted a &lt;a href=\"concurrent%20resolution\"&gt;concurrent resolution&lt;/a&gt; requesting the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20President\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Congress of the United States&lt;/a&gt; to respond diligently and effectively on the demand of the people of Puerto Rico to end its current political status and to begin the transition of Puerto Rico to become a state of the union.\nOn August 1, 2013, the Senate &lt;a href=\"Energy%20and%20Natural%20Resources%20Committee\"&gt;Energy and Natural Resources Committee&lt;/a&gt; held a hearing on Puerto Rico's status as a direct result of the 2012 referendum vote and invited Governor &lt;a href=\"Alejandro%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Padilla\"&gt;Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla&lt;/a&gt;, Resident Commissioner &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Pierluisi\"&gt;Pedro Pierluisi&lt;/a&gt;, and pro-independence supporter &lt;a href=\"Rub%C3%A9n%20Berr%C3%ADos\"&gt;Rub\u00e9n Berr\u00edos&lt;/a&gt; to give testimony and answer questions from the committee.\nIn 2014, resolutions were introduced in both houses of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; (H.R. 2000; S. 2020) to hold a yes-or-no referendum among the residents of Puerto Rico on statehood. If a \"yes\" majority prevailed, the President would have been required to submit legislation to Congress enacting Puerto Rican statehood. Both resolutions died in committee.\n2017 referendum.\nBecause there were almost 500,000 blank ballots in the 2012 referendum, creating confusion as to the voters' true desire, Congress decided to ignore the results. The &lt;a href=\"2014%20United%20States%20federal%20budget\"&gt;2014 budget bill&lt;/a&gt; included $2.5 million in funding for a future referendum; there was no deadline attached to the funds.\nThe fifth referendum, entitled \"Plebiscite for the immediate decolonization of Puerto Rico\" was held on June 11, 2017 and offered three options: \"Statehood\", \"Free Association/Independence\" and \"Current Territorial Status\", and the U.S. Justice Department required Puerto Rico to add the territorial status as an option as a requirement to release the $2.5 million funds set aside by the Obama administration to help educate the population on any future plebiscite, however the vote was held before the ballot could be reviewed, so the funds were not released. Newly elected Governor &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Rossell%C3%B3\"&gt;Ricardo Rossell\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; is strongly in favor of statehood for Puerto Rico to help develop the economy and help to \"solve our 500-year-old colonial dilemma... Colonialism is not an option... It\u2019s a civil rights issue ... 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy,\" he told the news media. Benefits of statehood include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds, the right to vote in presidential elections, higher Social Security and Medicare benefits, and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy. The latter is currently prohibited.\nThe turnout was only 23% because statehood opponents boycotted, arguing that the ballot language was biased towards pro-statehood. Some would later try to attribute the boycott to the &lt;a href=\"Popular%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Puerto%20Rico%29\"&gt;PPD&lt;/a&gt; party, citing its support for the status quo. Of the voters who participated, 97.18% chose statehood, 1.50% favored independence and 1.32% chose to maintain the commonwealth status.\nAt approximately the same time as the referendum, Puerto Rico's legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the Governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the U.S. Congress.\nIn June 2018, Rep. &lt;a href=\"Jenniffer%20Gonz%C3%A1lez\"&gt;Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez&lt;/a&gt; filed a bill that would have paved the way for Puerto Rico to become a state in 2021; the bill was not acted upon after introduction.\nUnited Nations Special Committee on Decolonization.\nSince 1953, the &lt;a href=\"UN\"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; has been considering the &lt;a href=\"Political%20status%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Political status of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; and how to assist it in achieving \"independence\" or \"decolonization\". In 1978, the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Committee%20on%20Decolonization\"&gt;Special Committee&lt;/a&gt; determined that a \"colonial relationship\" existed between the US and Puerto Rico.\nThe UN's Special Committee has often referred to Puerto Rico as a nation in its reports, because, internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity.&lt;ref name=\"United Nations. General Assembly. Special Committee on the Situation With Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples 1971 https://books.google.com/books?id=4nEyLDpKZjMC&amp;pg=PA10 10\u201311\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, in a June 2016 report, the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self-determination in Puerto Rico. More specifically, the group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence. ... [and] allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner, and to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty\".\nPuerto Rico Statehood Admission Act of 2019.\nA bill (H.R. 4901) for Puerto Ricans to vote \"yes\" or \"no\" on statehood was introduced on October 29, 2019 by Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner &lt;a href=\"Jenniffer%20Gonzalez%20Colon\"&gt;Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon&lt;/a&gt;. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources on the same day. Had it passed, the vote would have been scheduled for November 3, 2020.\nA corresponding bill in the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico that would implement the vote, known in English as the Law for the Final Definition of the Political Status of Puerto Rico (P.S. 1467), was approved by both houses on March 31, 2020, and sent to the Governor for signature. The single question is, \"Should Puerto Rico be immediately admitted into the Union as a state?\", with only two options: \"yes\" or \"no\".\n2020 referendum.\nOn May 16, 2020, Governor &lt;a href=\"Wanda%20V%C3%A1zquez%20Garced\"&gt;Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced&lt;/a&gt; announced that a referendum on Puerto Rico's statehood would be held in November. For the first time in the territory's history, only one direct question was asked: \"Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State?\" Previous referendums presented multiple options such as independence or maintaining the current territorial status. The announcement came amid growing disillusionment with Puerto Rico's territorial status due to the lack of access to federal funds for recent natural disasters, such as &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Maria\"&gt;Hurricane Maria&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe referendum was held on November 3 as part of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20elections\"&gt;2020 United States elections&lt;/a&gt; and yes to Statehood won. There were 655,505 voted yes to statehood (52.52%) and 592,671 voted no to statehood (47.48%). After the results, the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico Legislature&lt;/a&gt; passed the \"Puerto Rico Congressional Act\" &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lexjuris.com/Lexlex/Leyes2020/lexl2020167.htm\"&gt;Law 167 of 2020&lt;/a&gt; calling a special election to elect two shadow senators and four shadow congress-members to &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington D.C&lt;/a&gt;. to advocate for Statehood. In the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;US House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; a bill to provide for the admission of the State of Puerto Rico into the Union was introduced. These bills, H.R. 1522 and S. 780, were supported by 50 pro-statehood organizations, who \"[called] on the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Natural%20Resources\"&gt;House Committee on Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Energy%20and%20Natural%20Resources\"&gt;Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; to approve that legislation.\"\nStatehood supporters.\nThe Taking of Congress () was an event that started on January 15, 2013 in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Capitol\"&gt;United States Capitol&lt;/a&gt; in which more than 130 private citizens from different &lt;a href=\"advocacy%20groups%20in%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;advocacy groups in Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; started a campaign in which they visited every member of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; in order to speak about the results of the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rican%20status%20referendum%2C%202012\"&gt;2012 Puerto Rican status referendum&lt;/a&gt;in which a majority of voters expressed themselves against the &lt;a href=\"political%20status%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;current political status of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;. They also attempted to persuade the members of Congress to initiate a process to &lt;a href=\"Proposed%20political%20status%20for%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;change Puerto Rico's political status&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign was supported by former &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;U.S. representative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Enrique%20Serrano\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Enrique Serrano&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href=\"Resident%20Commissioner%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Pierluisi\"&gt;Pedro Pierluisi&lt;/a&gt;. Groups involved included \"Alianza Pro Libre Asociaci\u00f3n Soberana\" (ALAS), \"&lt;a href=\"Boricua%20Ahora%20Es\"&gt;Boricua Ahora Es&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Igualdad Futuro Seguro\", \"Renacer Ideol\u00f3gico Estadista\" (RIE), &lt;a href=\"Proyecto%20Estrella\"&gt;Proyecto Estrella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Young%20Democrats%20of%20America\"&gt;Young Democrats of America&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Young%20Republican%20Federation%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Young Republican Federation of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;."
