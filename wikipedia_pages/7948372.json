    "text": "Brachyramphus is a small genus of &lt;a href=\"seabird\"&gt;seabird&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"North%20Pacific\"&gt;North Pacific&lt;/a&gt;. \"Brachyramphus\" is from &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; \"brakhus\", \"short\", and \"rhamphos\", \"bill\". The species are named as \"murrelets\"; this is a diminutive of \"murre\", a word of uncertain origins, but which may imitate the call of the &lt;a href=\"common%20guillemot\"&gt;common guillemot&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe genus contains three species:\nThese are unusual members of the &lt;a href=\"auk\"&gt;auk&lt;/a&gt; family, often nesting far inland in &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s or on mountain tops. The long-billed murrelet was considered conspecific with the marbled murrelet until 1998, when Friesen \"et al.\" showed that the &lt;a href=\"mtDNA\"&gt;mtDNA&lt;/a&gt; variation was greater between these two forms than between marbled and Kittlitz's murrelets.\nThese species breed in the subarctic North Pacific. They tend to remain coastal in winter, either staying near the breeding grounds, or, in the case of long-billed, &lt;a href=\"bird%20migration\"&gt;migrating&lt;/a&gt; to the coast of &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo prehistoric species have been described from &lt;a href=\"Late%20Pliocene\"&gt;Late Pliocene&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s, found in the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Formation\"&gt;San Diego Formation&lt;/a&gt; of the southwestern USA: \"Brachyramphus dunkeli\" Chandler, 1990 and \"Brachyramphus pliocenus\" Howard, 1949\nDescription.\nThese are small chunky auks, no more than 25\u00a0cm long. Like other auks, they have &lt;a href=\"plumage\"&gt;plumage&lt;/a&gt; that varies by season. The non-breeding appearance is typically white underneath with mainly black upperparts. The breeding plumage is distinctive in this group; most auks are strongly contrasted with black and white when breeding, but \"Brachyramphus\" species are mainly brown, with pale feather edges giving a scaly appearance; the central underparts, normally below the surface on a swimming bird, are white.\nBehaviour and breeding.\nMurrelets feed at sea on small fish, larval fish, &lt;a href=\"krill\"&gt;krill&lt;/a&gt; and other small &lt;a href=\"Plankton\"&gt;zooplankton&lt;/a&gt;. Chicks are fed with larger fish carried in the bill.\nThe breeding behaviour of this genus is very unusual. Unlike most other seabirds, they do not breed in colonies or even necessarily close to the sea, instead nesting, depending on species, on branches of old-growth &lt;a href=\"conifer\"&gt;conifer&lt;/a&gt;s, mountaintops, or on open ground. They lay one &lt;a href=\"egg%20%28biology%29\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt; on bare ground or on a thick &lt;a href=\"lichen\"&gt;lichen&lt;/a&gt;- or &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;-covered branch or hollow. The egg is incubated for a month, then the chick is fed for around 40 days until it &lt;a href=\"fledge\"&gt;fledge&lt;/a&gt;s and flies unaccompanied to the sea. Breeding success is low and chick mortality high.\nThreats.\nAll three \"Brachyramphus\" murrelets are globally threatened and declining in numbers. The biggest threat are the loss of nesting &lt;a href=\"habitat%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;habitat&lt;/a&gt;, due to the loss of &lt;a href=\"old%20growth%20forest\"&gt;old growth forest&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"logging\"&gt;logging&lt;/a&gt; and retreating, entanglement in (&lt;a href=\"plastic\"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"fishing%20net\"&gt;fishing gear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"oil%20spill\"&gt;oil spill&lt;/a&gt;s."
