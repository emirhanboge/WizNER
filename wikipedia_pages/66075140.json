    "text": "\"Marjorie\" (stylized in &lt;a href=\"all%20lowercase\"&gt;all lowercase&lt;/a&gt;) is a song by American singer-songwriter &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20Swift\"&gt;Taylor Swift&lt;/a&gt;. It is the thirteenth song from her ninth studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20album%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;\" (2020), which was released on December 11, 2020, through &lt;a href=\"Republic%20Records\"&gt;Republic Records&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a tribute to Swift's late grandmother and opera singer &lt;a href=\"Marjorie%20Finlay\"&gt;Marjorie Finlay&lt;/a&gt;, the song depicts Finlay's advices to her granddaughter and Swift's guilt over not knowing her maternal grandmother to the fullest. It incorporates slow-burning &lt;a href=\"synthesizer\"&gt;synthesizer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"String%20%28music%29\"&gt;strings&lt;/a&gt;, and samples of Finlay's &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic vocals. Upon release of \"Evermore\", \"Marjorie\" was met with widespread critical acclaim, with praise for its emotion, lyricism, and production. Many critics selected the song as a highlight on \"Evermore\" and dubbed it one of Swift's most poignant songs. Commercially, \"Marjorie\" reached number 16 on the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Rock%20%26amp%3B%20Alternative%20Songs\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs&lt;/a&gt; chart, and entered various other charts globally.\nBackground and composition.\nPrior to releasing her ninth studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20album%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;\", Swift mentioned that one of its songs would be about her maternal grandmother. The song and its lyric video were both released on December 11, 2020, as the thirteenth track on the album. The song is a tribute to her maternal grandmother, &lt;a href=\"Marjorie%20Finlay\"&gt;Marjorie Finlay&lt;/a&gt;, who was born in &lt;a href=\"Memphis%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Memphis, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, on October 5, 1928, and died on June 1, 2003, in &lt;a href=\"Reading%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Reading, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. Finlay inspired Swift to pursue a musical career.\nThe song's lyrics are structured like chants, composed of life lessons Swift learned from Finlay, including: \"Never be so kind, you forget to be clever/ Never be so clever, you forget to be kind\". The song also depicts the grief and guilt Swift felt over the memory of her grandmother. The song's production is characterized by buzzing synths, strings, &lt;a href=\"Drone%20%28music%29\"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20%28music%29\"&gt;pulse&lt;/a&gt;, cello, and pulsing keyboard arrangement, ending with an elegant &lt;a href=\"Conclusion%20%28music%29%23Outro\"&gt;outro&lt;/a&gt;. \"Marjorie\" also samples Finlay's &lt;a href=\"soprano\"&gt;soprano&lt;/a&gt; as backing vocals and is a sister song to \"&lt;a href=\"Epiphany%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20song%29\"&gt;Epiphany&lt;/a&gt;\", the thirteenth track on Swift's eighth studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Folklore%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20album%29\"&gt;Folklore&lt;/a&gt;\" about Swift's paternal grandfather, Dean.\nWriting and production.\n\"Marjorie\" was the precursor to \"Peace\", the fifteenth track on \"Folklore\"; the &lt;a href=\"Drone%20%28music%29\"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt; in \"Peace\" is a sample of the drone in the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20%28music%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; of \"Marjorie\". The backing rhythm of \"Marjorie\" was composed from an \"Allovers &lt;a href=\"Hi-hat\"&gt;Hi-Hat&lt;/a&gt; Generator\", a software created by Minnesotan producer Ryan Olson that takes any sound and splits them into identifiable samples, reorganizing the samples in randomized musical patterns. &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Dessner\"&gt;Aaron Dessner&lt;/a&gt;, who co-wrote and produced the song, picked his favorite patterns, looped them, and developed them into an instrumental track. Swift wrote \"Marjorie\" to Dessner's track, and Swift provided Dessner with Finlay's old opera recordings, which he sampled on the final portion of the song.\nReception.\n\"Marjorie\" received critical acclaim. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20A.V.%20Club\"&gt;The A.V. Club&lt;/a&gt;\" critic &lt;a href=\"Annie%20Zaleski\"&gt;Annie Zaleski&lt;/a&gt; lauded \"Marjorie\" for its heart-wrenching lyricism and \"anguished\" production, and named it one of Swift's best songs to date. \"&lt;a href=\"NME\"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt;\" writer Hannah Mylrea thought that the song effectively depicts the grief and the complex guilt that is tied with it. Madeline Crone of \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Songwriter\"&gt;American Songwriter&lt;/a&gt;\" praised the \"lofty\" lyrics paying tribute to Finlay and the \"vivid imagery\" it evokes. She found its outro \"ethereal\", aided by Finlay's &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic vocals. Maura Johnston, writing for \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\", opined that the song's whirring synthesizers, strings, and Finlay's \"fluttery\" soprano add life to Swift's emotional vocals. Chris Willman of \"&lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;\" claimed that \"Marjorie\" will \"leave a dry eye only in houses that have never known death\", and the faint audio samples of Finlay's vocals is the \"pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\" of the song's poignancy.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Paste%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Paste&lt;/a&gt;\"'s Ellen Johnson commended the song as one of Swift's all-time best songs, and she wrote that her \"hard-won wisdom\" in the song makes it the most representing track of what \"Evermore\" is\u2014\"a peacefully intimate record\"\".\" In his review of \"Evermore\", Patrick Ryan of \"&lt;a href=\"USA%20Today\"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;\" highlighted \"Marjorie\" as a \"heart-rending tribute\". \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" writer Claire Shaffer dubbed \"Marjorie\" the centerpiece of \"Evermore\"\u2014a \"brilliant and devastating piece of songcraft, an instant classic in the Swift canon\"\u2014and compared it to Swift's 2012 single \"&lt;a href=\"Ronan%20%28song%29\"&gt;Ronan&lt;/a&gt;\", praising the singer's skills in writing a &lt;a href=\"eulogy\"&gt;eulogy&lt;/a&gt;. Shaffer added that she could not think of another song that \"so perfectly captures the delayed tragedy of losing a loved one when you're too young to see their full worth.\"\nStephen Erlwine of &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; opined that \"Evermore\" reaches its crescendo on \"Marjorie\", where the \"delicately shifting arrangement \u2014more electronic than acoustic\", \"underscores\" Swift's grief instead of heightening it. \"&lt;a href=\"Stereogum\"&gt;Stereogum&lt;/a&gt;\"s Tom Breihan commented that Swift ruminates on \"Marjorie\" the type of loss and regret that \"you can only really feel when someone dies\", over a soft, thumping synthesizer. &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Pareles\"&gt;Jon Pareles&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" praised the song's instrumentation\u2014\"glimmering\" &lt;a href=\"Electronic%20music\"&gt;electronic&lt;/a&gt; production enriched by subtle &lt;a href=\"pizzicato\"&gt;pizzicato&lt;/a&gt; strings. Punch Liwanag of the \"&lt;a href=\"Manila%20Bulletin\"&gt;Manila Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;\" called the song a \"beautifully emotional &lt;a href=\"Sentimental%20ballad\"&gt;ballad&lt;/a&gt;.\" Music journalist &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Sheffield\"&gt;Rob Sheffield&lt;/a&gt; placed it ninth on his 2021 ranking of all the 199 songs in Swift's discography.\nCommercial performance.\nIn the United States, \"Marjorie\" debuted and peaked at number 75 on the \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;. The song also peaked at number 16 on the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Rock%20%26amp%3B%20Alternative%20Songs\"&gt;Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs&lt;/a&gt; chart, staying for three weeks, and it peaked at number 56 on the &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone%20Top%20100\"&gt;Rolling Stone Top 100&lt;/a&gt; chart.
