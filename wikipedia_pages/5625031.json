    "text": "The Boys is a &lt;a href=\"comic%20book\"&gt;comic book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Limited%20series%20%28comics%29\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, written by &lt;a href=\"Garth%20Ennis\"&gt;Garth Ennis&lt;/a&gt; and co-created, designed, and illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Darick%20Robertson\"&gt;Darick Robertson&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally published by &lt;a href=\"WildStorm\"&gt;WildStorm&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"DC%20Comics\"&gt;DC Comics&lt;/a&gt;) before being bought and moved to &lt;a href=\"Dynamite%20Entertainment\"&gt;Dynamite Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;.\nDebuting in October 2006, the series concluded in November 2012 with the release of the 72nd and final issue.\nThe book was adapted by &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Studios\"&gt;Amazon Studios&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"The%20Boys%20%282019%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;television series&lt;/a&gt; that premiered on July 26, 2019 through a brand licensing rights agreement with Dynamite Entertainment.\nPublication history.\nThe first six issues of \"The Boys\" were published by &lt;a href=\"Wildstorm\"&gt;Wildstorm&lt;/a&gt;, starting in 2006. On January 24, 2007, the series was abruptly canceled with issue 6. Ennis later explained that this was because DC Comics (of which Wildstorm was an &lt;a href=\"Imprint%20%28trade%20name%29\"&gt;imprint&lt;/a&gt; before it was disbanded) were uneasy with the anti-superhero tone of the work. The planned collection of said issues was also canceled. Co-creator Darick Robertson said that \"DC is being good about reverting our rights so we can find a new publisher and we're in the process of doing that now\". Ennis then released a statement that some other publishers had expressed interest, and that issue 7 and a &lt;a href=\"trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29\"&gt;trade paperback&lt;/a&gt; of the first six issues would be available. While Robertson was on exclusive contract to DC, he was given special dispensation to continue working on \"The Boys\". In February 2007 the series was picked up by &lt;a href=\"Dynamite%20Entertainment\"&gt;Dynamite Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; and it resumed in May. A collected edition of the first six issues was also published by Dynamite, with a foreword by &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Pegg\"&gt;Simon Pegg&lt;/a&gt;. Pegg was the model on whom the character Hughie was based in the way he was drawn in the comics by Robertson.\nIn February 2009, Dynamite announced a &lt;a href=\"Spin-off%20%28media%29\"&gt;spin-off&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Limited%20series%20%28comics%29\"&gt;mini-series&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Herogasm\"&gt;Herogasm&lt;/a&gt;\", with art from &lt;a href=\"John%20McCrea%20%28comics%29\"&gt;John McCrea&lt;/a&gt; and Keith Burns; subsequent miniseries including &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Laddie%20%28comics%29\"&gt;\"Highland Laddie\"&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Butcher%2C%20Baker%2C%20Candlestick%20Maker\"&gt;Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker&lt;/a&gt;\", with the three series each later being compiled as volumes of \"The Boys\".\nAfter \"The Boys\" was completed, Ennis told &lt;a href=\"CBR.com\"&gt;CBR.com&lt;/a&gt; that the comic had benefitted from Wildstorm cancelling it, in that Dynamite gave him far more freedom than DC ever would have, saying, \"We'd have died on the vine [at DC]. The book would have been chipped and chipped away at until writing it was pure frustration.\" He also admitted to \"a sigh of relief\" as Wildstorm had been dissolved as an imprint not long after the move.\nAn eight-issue &lt;a href=\"epilogue\"&gt;epilogue&lt;/a&gt; series, \"&lt;a href=\"Dear%20Becky\"&gt;Dear Becky&lt;/a&gt;\", was published from June to November 2020.\nPlot.\nThe series is set between 2006\u20132008 in a world where &lt;a href=\"superhero\"&gt;superhero&lt;/a&gt;es exist. However, most of the superheroes in the series' universe are corrupted by their &lt;a href=\"celebrity\"&gt;celebrity&lt;/a&gt; status and often engage in reckless behavior, compromising the safety of the world. The story follows a small &lt;a href=\"Clandestine%20operation\"&gt;clandestine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"CIA\"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; squad, informally known as \"The Boys\", led by &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Butcher\"&gt;Billy Butcher&lt;/a&gt; and comprising Mother's Milk, the Frenchman, the Female, and new addition \"Wee\" Hughie Campbell, who are charged with monitoring the superhero community, often leading to gruesome confrontations and dreadful results; in parallel, a key subplot follows &lt;a href=\"Starlight%20%28The%20Boys%29\"&gt;Annie \"Starlight\" January&lt;/a&gt;, a young and naive superhero who joins the Seven, the most prestigious \u2013 and corrupted \u2013 superhero group in the world and The Boys' most powerful enemies.\nCollected editions.\nDynamite releases both hardcover and &lt;a href=\"trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29\"&gt;trade paperback&lt;/a&gt; collections on an ongoing basis (including those comics previously published by &lt;a href=\"Wildstorm\"&gt;Wildstorm&lt;/a&gt;). In addition, Dynamite also releases \"Definitive\" slipcased hardcovers, which contain two trade/hardcover collections to an \"omnibus.\"\nAdaptations.\nAborted film.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;\" reported in February 2008 that &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Pictures\"&gt;Columbia Pictures&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=\"Option%20%28filmmaking%29\"&gt;optioned&lt;/a&gt; the comic for a film adaptation, to be produced by &lt;a href=\"Neal%20H.%20Moritz\"&gt;Neal H. Moritz&lt;/a&gt;. and &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Hay%20%28screenwriter%29\"&gt;Phil Hay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Manfredi\"&gt;Matt Manfredi&lt;/a&gt; writing the screenplay. In August 2010, &lt;a href=\"Adam%20McKay\"&gt;Adam McKay&lt;/a&gt; said that he had been signed on to direct the film. McKay added, \"They already have a script and we're doing a rewrite on it so hopefully getting the whole thing into shape in the Fall with maybe a shoot happening in January.\" Columbia Pictures reported in February 2012 that it had dropped its option regarding a film adaptation of \"The Boys\". However, Adam McKay said in a Twitter response that &lt;a href=\"Paramount%20Pictures\"&gt;Paramount Pictures&lt;/a&gt; had picked it up, and that it was still in the works. On April 30, 2013, Manfredi and Hay were hired by Paramount to write the film, though the project never came to fruition.\nTelevision series.\nIn October 2015 it was reported that &lt;a href=\"Cinemax\"&gt;Cinemax&lt;/a&gt; greenlit a television series adaptation of \"The Boys\", and that &lt;a href=\"Seth%20Rogen\"&gt;Seth Rogen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evan%20Goldberg\"&gt;Evan Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Kripke\"&gt;Eric Kripke&lt;/a&gt; were producing the series. In September 2017, \"Variety\" reported that &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Studios\"&gt;Amazon Studios&lt;/a&gt; had picked up the series. The series premiered on July 26, 2019. The second season premiered on September 4, 2020. A third season and &lt;a href=\"Spin-off%20%28media%29\"&gt;spin-off&lt;/a&gt; have also been ordered."
