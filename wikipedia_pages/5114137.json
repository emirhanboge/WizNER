    "text": "Avellaneda is a &lt;a href=\"departments%20of%20Argentina\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"R%C3%ADo%20Negro%20Province\"&gt;R\u00edo Negro Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is crossed by the &lt;a href=\"R%C3%ADo%20Negro%20%28Argentina%29\"&gt;Negro River&lt;/a&gt; forming a fertile valley known as the \"Valle Medio\". The river bifurcates and then both arms join again forming two main islands known as Isla Grande de Choele Choel and Isla Chica de Choele Choel and a few smaller ones. The \"Isla Grande\" holds the towns of &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Beltr%C3%A1n%2C%20R%C3%ADo%20Negro\"&gt;Luis Beltr\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lamarque%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;Lamarque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pomona%2C%20R%C3%ADo%20Negro\"&gt;Pomona&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the most fertile area of the department, with cultivations of &lt;a href=\"tomato\"&gt;tomato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pear\"&gt;pear&lt;/a&gt;s among the most important.\n&lt;a href=\"Choele%20Choel\"&gt;Choele Choel&lt;/a&gt;, on the other side of the river from the \"Isla Grande\" and at the intersection of Argentine National Route 22 and Provincial Route 250 that crosses the island, is the transport hub of the area with an important long-distance bus terminal, and an airport currently operating only private flights.\nThrough &lt;a href=\"Darwin%2C%20R%C3%ADo%20Negro\"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;, outside the fertile valley, passes the railway that connects &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Bariloche\"&gt;Bariloche&lt;/a&gt;, but the line is currently almost inactive, with occasional cargo-train traffic that doesn't stop at the town."
