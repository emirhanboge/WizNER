It was one of the major motion picture companies to distribute &lt;a href=\"independent%20film\"&gt;independent film&lt;/a&gt;s outside the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and other countries.\nHistory.\nPrior to the company (1984\u20131998).\nThe company was formed in 1984 by Stephen Roth, &lt;a href=\"Denis%20H%C3%A9roux\"&gt;Denis H\u00e9roux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Kemeny%20%28film%20producer%29\"&gt;John Kemeny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Lantos\"&gt;Robert Lantos&lt;/a&gt;, Andras Hamori and Susan Cavan as Alliance Entertainment, from a merger of RSL Entertainment Corporation and International Cinema Corporation, with financing from New Century Entertainment's SLM Productions and gave them a $10 million fund.\nIn 1986, the company had completed the first six projects in the first twelve months, and the company's fare was to be shown on &lt;a href=\"Big%20Three%20TV%20Networks\"&gt;the Big Three networks&lt;/a&gt;, namely &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, as well as cable channel &lt;a href=\"HBO\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; and Canadian channel &lt;a href=\"CTV%20Television%20Network\"&gt;CTV&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a financing agreement with New Century/SLM Productions. One of Alliance's well known TV projects was \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20Heat\"&gt;Night Heat&lt;/a&gt;\", and had to develop several television miniseries.\nIt acquired a Montreal-based Francophone distribution company, Vivafilm, in 1990. In 1998, it merged with Atlantis Communications, forming &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Atlantis\"&gt;Alliance Atlantis Communications&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater years (2007\u20132013).\nIn partnership with &lt;a href=\"Cineplex%20Entertainment\"&gt;Cineplex Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance Films (operating as Motion Picture Distribution LP under &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Atlantis\"&gt;Alliance Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;) also operated &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Cinemas\"&gt;Alliance Cinemas&lt;/a&gt;, owner of two &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;-area theatres. During the MPD era, all materials relating to Alliance Atlantis\u2013distributed films contained a disclaimer stating that Alliance Atlantis was \"an indirect limited partner of Motion Picture Distribution LP, not a general partner\". However, in fact, the company controlled the general partner of the partnership, and hence effectively controlled the distribution unit itself.\nFormerly known as Motion Picture Distribution LP, it was rebranded and relaunched in 2007 due to the collapse of its preceding company, &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Atlantis\"&gt;Alliance Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;, which was sold off piece by piece to &lt;a href=\"CanWest%20Global\"&gt;CanWest Global&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldman%20Sachs%23GS%20Capital%20Partners\"&gt;GS Capital Partners&lt;/a&gt;, along with several other smaller companies. &lt;a href=\"Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20de%20financement\"&gt;Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de financement du Qu\u00e9bec&lt;/a&gt;, an investment agency of the provincial government, owns 51% of the voting shares of the company and 38.5% of the equity. GS Capital owns the remainder of the company.\nAlliance Films was headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Quartier%20International\"&gt;Quartier International&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the mid-2000s, Alliance Films began to produce films in moderation. In addition to producing films as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Rocket%20%282005%20film%29\"&gt;The Rocket&lt;/a&gt; (Maurice Richard)\" with &lt;a href=\"Cin%C3%A9maginaire\"&gt;Cin\u00e9maginaire&lt;/a&gt; (as well as other movies), \"&lt;a href=\"National%20Lampoon%27s%20Senior%20Trip\"&gt;National Lampoon's Senior Trip&lt;/a&gt;\" with New Line Cinema and \"&lt;a href=\"Munich%20%282005%20film%29\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;\" with Universal Pictures, DreamWorks SKG and Amblin Entertainment of and before the days of &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Atlantis\"&gt;Alliance Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; respectively, they were responsible for co-producing the 2008 teen slasher \"&lt;a href=\"Prom%20Night%20%282008%20film%29\"&gt;Prom Night&lt;/a&gt;\" with &lt;a href=\"Screen%20Gems\"&gt;Screen Gems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Film\"&gt;Original Film&lt;/a&gt;.

They are also responsible for co-producing the 2011 horror film \"&lt;a href=\"Insidious%20%28film%29\"&gt;Insidious&lt;/a&gt;\" with FilmDistrict and \"&lt;a href=\"Wanderlust%20%282011%20film%29\"&gt;Wanderlust&lt;/a&gt;\" with Universal Pictures and Apatow Productions.\nIn 2010, Alliance Films expanded its home video operations with an aggressive push into the TV-on-DVD market. It began releasing various television series on DVD, the majority are Canadian productions or Canadian co-productions. To date they have released over 20 series and continue to release more.\nOn June 24, 2011, Alliance Films bought &lt;a href=\"Maple%20Pictures\"&gt;Maple Pictures&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lionsgate\"&gt;Lionsgate&lt;/a&gt; for a total of $38.5 million before Alliance was folded into Entertainment One in early 2013.\nSince early 2010, Alliance Films has been partnering with Jason Blum and his BlumHouse Productions to produce low budget horror films.
