    "text": "Jonah H. Peretti (born January 1, 1974) is an &lt;a href=\"Internet%20entrepreneur\"&gt;Internet entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;, a co-founder and the &lt;a href=\"CEO\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"BuzzFeed\"&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of \"&lt;a href=\"HuffPost\"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;\", and developer of &lt;a href=\"reblogging\"&gt;reblogging&lt;/a&gt; under the project \"Reblog\".\nEducation and early career.\nPeretti was born in California and raised in &lt;a href=\"Oakland%2C%20California\"&gt;Oakland, California&lt;/a&gt;. His father, a &lt;a href=\"criminal%20defense%20lawyer\"&gt;criminal defense lawyer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"painter\"&gt;painter&lt;/a&gt;, is of &lt;a href=\"Italians\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"English%20people\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; descent and his mother (\"n\u00e9e\" Cherkin), a &lt;a href=\"schoolteacher\"&gt;schoolteacher&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=\"Jewish\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt;. His stepmother was &lt;a href=\"African-American\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt;. He attended &lt;a href=\"The%20College%20Preparatory%20School\"&gt;The College Preparatory School&lt;/a&gt; in Oakland, followed by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Cruz\"&gt;University of California, Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, where he graduated with a degree in &lt;a href=\"environmental%20studies\"&gt;environmental studies&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. He taught &lt;a href=\"computer%20science\"&gt;computer science&lt;/a&gt; classes at &lt;a href=\"Isidore%20Newman%20School\"&gt;Isidore Newman School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, in the mid-1990s. He received a &lt;a href=\"master%27s%20degree\"&gt;master's degree&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"MIT%20Media%20Lab\"&gt;MIT Media Lab&lt;/a&gt; in 2001.\nWhile at MIT, his email exchange with &lt;a href=\"Nike%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt; over a request to print \"&lt;a href=\"sweatshop\"&gt;sweatshop&lt;/a&gt;\" on custom order shoes went viral.\nIn 2013, it came to light that after graduating from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1996, Peretti published an article titled \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\" in \"Negations,\" a Texas-based journal of critical theory. The paper demonstrated the \"psychological link between one-dimensionality and advertising\".\nCareer.\nPeretti co-founded \"&lt;a href=\"HuffPost\"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" along with &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Lerer\"&gt;Kenneth Lerer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Breitbart\"&gt;Andrew Breitbart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arianna%20Huffington\"&gt;Arianna Huffington&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. He left \"The Huffington Post\" in 2011 after it was bought by &lt;a href=\"AOL\"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt; for $315 million.\nIn 2005, Peretti hosted the Contagious Media Showdown at &lt;a href=\"Eyebeam%20Art%20and%20Technology%20Center\"&gt;Eyebeam&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, where he worked as director of the &lt;a href=\"R%26amp%3BD\"&gt;R&amp;D&lt;/a&gt; Lab from 2001 to 2006. During the process Peretti developed the concept of the \"Bored-at-Work Network\", which he supposes to be larger than some major television network audiences.\nPeretti founded the \"Internet popularity contest\" site &lt;a href=\"BuzzFeed\"&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/a&gt; in November 2006. After leaving \"The Huffington Post\", Peretti began working at BuzzFeed full-time. While originally known for its mix of &lt;a href=\"internet%20meme\"&gt;internet meme&lt;/a&gt;s and lists, the site was the first to break the news that &lt;a href=\"John%20McCain\"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; would endorse &lt;a href=\"Mitt%20Romney\"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Republican%20Primary\"&gt;2012 Republican Primary&lt;/a&gt;. The site continued to grow afterward, raising over $35 million in funding from investors the next year. In August 2014, the site raised another $50 million from the &lt;a href=\"venture%20capital%20firm\"&gt;venture capital firm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Andreessen%20Horowitz\"&gt;Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/a&gt;, more than doubling its previous &lt;a href=\"round%20of%20funding\"&gt;rounds of funding&lt;/a&gt;. The site was valued at $850 million by Andreessen Horowitz.\nIn 2019, Peretti announced that BuzzFeed would be cutting its overall workforce by 15 percent. Peretti said he wanted to reduce costs without resorting to additional fundraising. Its remaining workforce then officially unionized, their first successful fight being over laid-off staffers getting their earned paid time off.\nIn 2021 at a virtual company meeting, Peretti, as BuzzFeed\u2019s chief executive, fired 47 employees at &lt;a href=\"Huffington%20Post\"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; in a controversial manner, sending a virtual meeting password \"spr!ngisH3r3\" to laid-off employees.\nThe HuffPost Union, which is affiliated with the Writers Guild of America East, said in a statement that the layoffs had affected 33 of its members, nearly a third of the local union. \u201cWe are devastated and infuriated, particularly after an exhausting year of covering a pandemic and working from home,\u201d the union said in a statement.\nPersonal life.\nHe is the elder brother of &lt;a href=\"comedian\"&gt;comedian&lt;/a&gt;, actress and writer &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20Peretti\"&gt;Chelsea Peretti&lt;/a&gt;. He is married to blogger Andrea Harner, with whom he has twin sons."
