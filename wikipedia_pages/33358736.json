    "text": "North Easton station is a former railroad station designed by noted American architect &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Hobson%20Richardson\"&gt;H. H. Richardson&lt;/a&gt;. It is located just off Oliver Street in &lt;a href=\"North%20Easton%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;North Easton, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, and currently houses the Easton Historical Society. The station was built in 1881 and served commuter trains until 1958. It was added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1972 as Old Colony Railroad Station. In 1987, it also became part of the &lt;a href=\"H.%20H.%20Richardson%20Historic%20District%20of%20North%20Easton\"&gt;H. H. Richardson Historic District of North Easton&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark%20District\"&gt;National Historic Landmark District&lt;/a&gt;. The proposed Phase 2 of &lt;a href=\"South%20Coast%20Rail\"&gt;South Coast Rail&lt;/a&gt; would return commuter rail service to the location in 2030 as Easton Village station.\nHistory.\nThe Easton Branch Railroad opened from Stoughton to North Easton on May 16, 1855. Originally part of the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20and%20Providence%20Railroad\"&gt;Boston and Providence Railroad&lt;/a&gt;, it became part of the &lt;a href=\"Dighton%20and%20Somerset%20Railroad\"&gt;Dighton and Somerset Railroad&lt;/a&gt; in 1866.\nA new station was commissioned in 1881 by &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Lothrop%20Ames\"&gt;Frederick Lothrop Ames&lt;/a&gt;, director of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Colony%20Railroad\"&gt;Old Colony Railroad&lt;/a&gt;, during the same year that Richardson designed the &lt;a href=\"Ames%20Gate%20Lodge\"&gt;Ames Gate Lodge&lt;/a&gt; for his nearby estate. &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Law%20Olmsted\"&gt;Frederick Law Olmsted&lt;/a&gt; landscaped its grounds. It is a relatively small station, a single story in height with Richardson's characteristic heavy masonry and outsized roof. Its long axis runs north-south with the tracks, now disused, along its west side. The building is laid out symmetrically within, with a large passenger room at each end (one for women, the other for men).\nThe station's facade is constructed of rough-faced, random &lt;a href=\"ashlar\"&gt;ashlar&lt;/a&gt; of gray granite with a brownstone &lt;a href=\"belt%20course\"&gt;belt course&lt;/a&gt; and trim. Two large, semicircular arches punctuate each of the long facades, inset with windows and doorways, and ornamented with carvings of a beast's snarling head; a further semicircular arch projects to form the east facade's &lt;a href=\"porte-cochere\"&gt;porte-cochere&lt;/a&gt;. Eaves project deeply over all sides, supported by plain wooden &lt;a href=\"Bracket%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;brackets&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommuter rail service past &lt;a href=\"Stoughton%20%28MBTA%20station%29\"&gt;Stoughton&lt;/a&gt; was cut on September 5, 1958. In 1969, the Ames family purchased the property from the &lt;a href=\"Penn%20Central%20Railroad\"&gt;Penn Central Railroad&lt;/a&gt; and gave it to the historical society. It was added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1972. In 1987, it also became part of the &lt;a href=\"H.%20H.%20Richardson%20Historic%20District%20of%20North%20Easton\"&gt;H. H. Richardson Historic District of North Easton&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark%20District\"&gt;National Historic Landmark District&lt;/a&gt;.\nA new &lt;a href=\"MBTA%20Commuter%20Rail\"&gt;MBTA Commuter Rail&lt;/a&gt; station, Easton Village, is proposed to be built at the site as part of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Coast%20Rail\"&gt;South Coast Rail&lt;/a&gt; project. An high-level platform will be constructed across the track from the historic building."
