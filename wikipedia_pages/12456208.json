    "text": "Grallina is a genus of &lt;a href=\"passerine\"&gt;passerine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; native to Australia and &lt;a href=\"New%20Guinea\"&gt;New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;. It is a member of a group of birds termed &lt;a href=\"monarch%20flycatcher\"&gt;monarch flycatcher&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTaxonomy.\nHigher taxonomy.\nLong thought to be a member of the mudnest builder family &lt;a href=\"Corcoracidae\"&gt;Corcoracidae&lt;/a&gt;, the magpie-lark and torrent lark have been reclassified in the family Monarchidae (the monarch flycatchers). The two make up a lineage that split off early from other monarchs and has no close relatives within the family.\nThe monarch flycatchers are considered either as a subfamily Monarchinae, together with the &lt;a href=\"fantail\"&gt;fantail&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the drongo family &lt;a href=\"Dicruridae\"&gt;Dicruridae&lt;/a&gt;, or as a family Monarchidae in its own right. More broadly, they belong to the &lt;a href=\"Corvida\"&gt;Corvida&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"parvorder\"&gt;parvorder&lt;/a&gt; comprising many tropical and Australian passerines including &lt;a href=\"Pardalotidae\"&gt;pardalotes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maluridae\"&gt;fairy-wrens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meliphagidae\"&gt;honeyeaters&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"crow\"&gt;crow&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpecies.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; are recognized:"
