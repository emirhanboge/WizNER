    "text": "The Circassians in Syria (&lt;a href=\"Circassian%20language\"&gt;Circassian&lt;/a&gt;: \u0421\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0438\u0441 \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d\u0445\u044d\u0440; ) refers to the &lt;a href=\"Circassian%20diaspora\"&gt;Circassian diaspora&lt;/a&gt; settled in &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; (then &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Syria\"&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;) in the 19th century. They moved to Syria after the &lt;a href=\"Circassian%20genocide\"&gt;Circassian genocide&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Circassian%20War\"&gt;Russo-Circassian War&lt;/a&gt;. While they have become an increasingly assimilated part of Syrian society, they have maintained a distinct identity, having retained their &lt;a href=\"Adyghe%20language\"&gt;Adyghe language&lt;/a&gt; (in addition to &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;), their tribal heritage and some of their traditional customs. \nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in Syria, the Circassian population was estimated to be around 100,000 . Since the decade long conflict began in 2011, the predominantly &lt;a href=\"Sunni%20Muslim\"&gt;Sunni Muslim&lt;/a&gt; population of ethnic Circassians in Syria has dwindled. \nMany of Syria's ethnic Circassians have left the country and have repatriated or are in the process of repatriation to the titular Circassian parts of &lt;a href=\"European%20Russia\"&gt;European Russia&lt;/a&gt;, in particular &lt;a href=\"Adygea\"&gt;Adygea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kabardino-Balkaria\"&gt;Kabardino-Balkaria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karachay-Cherkessia\"&gt;Karachay-Cherkessia&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to partially recognised &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Republic of Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2018 Professor John Shoup said that the Circassian population in Syria formed about 1% of the country's total population, making them the sixth largest ethnic group in the country.\nHistory.\nExile and resettlement.\nCircassians began a forced migration from their homeland in the Northwest Caucasus region to the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Russian%E2%80%93Circassian%20War\"&gt;Russian\u2013Circassian War&lt;/a&gt; in 1864. While they originally settled in parts of &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt;, they began emigrating to the empire's Syrian provinces (the &lt;a href=\"Levant\"&gt;Levant&lt;/a&gt;) in large numbers (about 70,000) after the Ottoman defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877-1878%29\"&gt;Balkan War&lt;/a&gt; of 1877\u201378. That group of Circassians was mostly resettled by the Ottoman authorities as part of an effort to counterbalance increasing dissent by the local population in Syria, far from the capital &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, with more loyal subjects of the empire. Many Circassians subsequently concentrated their residence in the &lt;a href=\"Golan%20Heights\"&gt;Golan Heights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Transjordan%20%28region%29\"&gt;Transjordan&lt;/a&gt; regions, both part of the &lt;a href=\"Damascus%20Vilayet\"&gt;Province of Damascus&lt;/a&gt; at the time. At around this time, in the late 1870s, the influx of Circassians traveling through Damascus led to the establishment of a number of villages north of &lt;a href=\"Homs\"&gt;Homs&lt;/a&gt; and along the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Desert\"&gt;Syrian Desert&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in the area surrounding Damascus city itself, namely &lt;a href=\"Marj%20al-Sultan\"&gt;Marj al-Sultan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"al-Dumayr\"&gt;al-Dumayr&lt;/a&gt;. Circassians eventually abandoned the latter town.\nNearly all of the Circassian villages founded in &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Syria\"&gt;Ottoman Syria&lt;/a&gt; were located on known conflict fronts, mostly involving the &lt;a href=\"Druze\"&gt;Druze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bedouin\"&gt;Bedouin&lt;/a&gt; tribes, including the '&lt;a href=\"Annizah\"&gt;Annizah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Al%20Fadl\"&gt;Al Fadl&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Circassians were militarily able to resist the \"khuwwa\" (\"unofficial 'protection' tax\") demanded of the local peasantry by various Bedouin tribes\u2014which came at the detriment of government tax collection\u2014they managed to make agreements to mutually benefit the two factions. Nonetheless, clashes still periodically occurred between the Circassians of the Golan and &lt;a href=\"Ghouta\"&gt;Ghouta&lt;/a&gt; (rural Damascus) regions and the Bedouin. The most severe local conflicts the Circassians engaged in at the time was with the often rebellious Druze, who dominated the area of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hermon\"&gt;Mount Hermon&lt;/a&gt; in the northern Golan Heights and the &lt;a href=\"Jabal%20al-Druze\"&gt;Jabal al-Druze&lt;/a&gt; region to the east. Historians have asserted that the Ottomans encouraged Circassian settlement in this particular region to serve as a pro-sultanate buffer between the two Druze-inhabited areas. In addition, Circassians generally favored residence in the Golan as compared to the city quarters because the area resembled the Caucasian ancestral lands with its wooded mountains, heavy rainfall and snow.\nIn the first decade of the 20th century the Ottoman government facilitated a wave of Circassian resettlement to the northern &lt;a href=\"Euphrates%20River\"&gt;Euphrates River&lt;/a&gt;. They largely left the Caucasus on their own accord, fearing forcible conversion to the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Russian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Tsardom%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Czarist&lt;/a&gt; forces. A &lt;a href=\"Kabardian%20people\"&gt;Kabardian&lt;/a&gt; group initially settled in &lt;a href=\"Raqqa\"&gt;Raqqa&lt;/a&gt;, establishing their new settlement immediately west of the &lt;a href=\"Arab\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt;-dominated town. Funds from the provincial treasury and local contributors enabled each immigrant family to own a plot of land, a two-room house, a horse stable, two oxen and five grain sacks. Talustan Anzor, the leader of this Kabardian faction, acquired prestige in the &lt;a href=\"Raqqa%20District\"&gt;Raqqa District&lt;/a&gt; as a noted mediator of disputes. Together with &lt;a href=\"Manbij\"&gt;Manbij&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khanasser\"&gt;Khanasser&lt;/a&gt;, two other towns in the Euphrates valley, the Kabardian settlements were meant to serve as a strategic ring around Raqqa where the &lt;a href=\"gendarmerie\"&gt;gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt; could be conveniently recruited.\nIn Circassian narratives of these years, there were rarely any negative words against the local Arab population, which welcomed the Circassian immigrants. Because of their Muslim religion, which was the dominant faith in Syria, and their arrival to the region well before the struggle for independence from the Ottomans and later the &lt;a href=\"French%20Mandate%20of%20Syria\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, the Circassians played a role in the founding of the modern state of Syria and immediately became full citizens. However, because of the integration of a number of Circassian cavalry units in the French &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Levant\"&gt;Army of the Levant&lt;/a&gt;, and particularly due to their role in quelling the Druze forces of &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Pasha%20al-Atrash\"&gt;Sultan Pasha al-Atrash&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Syrian%20Revolt\"&gt;Great Syrian Revolt&lt;/a&gt; (1925\u201327), relations with the Arab majority became somewhat tense in the early years of the republic. A minority of Circassians in the Golan Heights petitioned for &lt;a href=\"Autonomy%23Politics\"&gt;autonomy&lt;/a&gt; from Damascus during the French Mandatory years.\nPost-independence.\nFollowing Syria's independence from French control in 1946, Circassian-dominated military units were disbanded. During the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, a few were hastily reassembled as part of the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Army\"&gt;Syrian Army&lt;/a&gt; and put under the command of Jawad Anzor. About 200 soldiers from this unit, including Anzor, were killed during the war. After the Syrian defeat in the 1967 &lt;a href=\"Six-Day%20War\"&gt;Six-Day War&lt;/a&gt;, the Circassian population largely fled the Golan Heights region, which was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Defense%20Forces\"&gt;Israeli Army&lt;/a&gt;. Most relocated to the cities of Damascus and Aleppo, while many later moved to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; (particularly &lt;a href=\"Paterson%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Paterson, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orange%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;Orange County, California&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. Some Circassians returned to villages east of the ceasefire line with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, namely &lt;a href=\"Beer%20Ajam\"&gt;Beer Ajam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bariqa\"&gt;Bariqa&lt;/a&gt; after the 1973 &lt;a href=\"Yom%20Kippur%20War\"&gt;Yom Kippur War&lt;/a&gt;.\nCivil war.\nCircassians have generally stayed neutral during the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Syrian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; between the government and anti-government rebels, which began in March 2011. However, a significant number serve in the security apparatus, including the military, while a number have either defected, or have joined rebel ranks. At least 35 Circassians have been reported killed during the conflict, and &lt;a href=\"Golan%20Heights%20clashes%20%282012%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;clashes&lt;/a&gt; between the rebels and the Syrian Army have occurred in both Beer Ajam and Bariqa as well as in Marj Sultan near Damascus, all three being Circassian villages. According to journalist Fahim Tastakin, writing in the Turkish newspaper \"Radikal\", as of November 2012, 250 Circassians have fled to Turkey, while 5,000 \"want to come.\" The \"&lt;a href=\"Anadolu%20Agency\"&gt;Anadolu Agency&lt;/a&gt;\" reported in late January 2013, that the number of Syrian Circassians who have sought asylum in Turkey was 700. The majority reside with family members instead of camps hosting &lt;a href=\"Refugees%20of%20the%20Syrian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Syrian refugees&lt;/a&gt;. Another common destination is &lt;a href=\"Jordan\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, south of Syria, where some Circassian families have relatives. Many Circassians are actively seeking repatriation in the various North Caucasus republics and &lt;a href=\"oblast\"&gt;oblast&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. About 400 have resettled in &lt;a href=\"Kabardino-Balkaria\"&gt;Kabardino-Balkaria&lt;/a&gt;, 220 in &lt;a href=\"Adygea\"&gt;Adygea&lt;/a&gt; and 40 in &lt;a href=\"Karachay-Cherkessia\"&gt;Karachay-Cherkessia&lt;/a&gt;. Tastikin writes a total of 1,200 have left for Russia.\nCulture.\nIn the past Syria's Circassian community mainly spoke &lt;a href=\"Circassian%20language\"&gt;Adyghe&lt;/a&gt; and today many still speak Adyghe among themselves, although all learn Arabic in school, as it is the official language of the state. English is also studied. Unlike other non-Arab Sunni Muslim minorities in Syria, such as the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Turks\"&gt;Turkoman&lt;/a&gt;s, the Circassians have maintained a distinct identity, although in recent times they have become increasingly assimilated. During weddings and holidays, some members of the community wear traditional dress and engage in folk songs and dance.\nCircassians are generally well-off, with many being employed in government posts, the civil service and the military. In the rural regions, Circassians are organized by a tribal system. In these areas, the communities mostly engage in agriculture, especially grain cultivation, and raise livestock including horses, cattle, goats and sheep. Many also engage in traditional jobs as blacksmiths, gold and silversmiths, carpenters and stonemasons.\nPopulation.\nAccording to statistics provided by the Caucasus Foundation, the Circassian population in 1990 was 28,500, increasing to about 40,000 in 2000. However, the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Congress\"&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt; put the number at 100,000 in 1987. Other more recent sources have also estimated the population to be at 100,000, although specific years for the figures are not provided. The \"Journal of the Turkish Weekly\" writes the Circassian population to be as high as 130,000. With the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Syrian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and the massive wave of Syrian refugees, many ethnic Circassians have also left the country, with amongst them, many repatriating to their ancestral lands in Russia's Caucasus region. Professor John Shoup said in 2018 that the Circassian population formed about 1% of the country's total population.\nGeographic distribution.\nPrior to the 1967 War, about half of the Circassian population lived in the &lt;a href=\"Quneitra%20Governorate\"&gt;Quneitra Governorate&lt;/a&gt;, inhabiting 11 villages and the major town of &lt;a href=\"Quneitra\"&gt;Quneitra&lt;/a&gt;. The latter, which had a significant Circassian population, was depopulated during the war and although it is under Syrian control, it has not been resettled. Circassian-dominated villages included Jawziah, Khishniyyah, Ayn Ziwan, Salmaniyah, Mumsiyah, Mansura, Faham, Mudariyah, Ramthaniya, &lt;a href=\"Bariqa\"&gt;Bariqa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beer%20Ajam\"&gt;Beer Ajam&lt;/a&gt;. Only the latter two have been repopulated, most of the remainder are located in the &lt;a href=\"Israeli-occupied%20territories\"&gt;Israeli-occupied&lt;/a&gt; part of the territory. Displaced Circassians continue to claim their lands and homes in the Golan Heights.\nMany Circassians have relocated to Damascus after being displaced from the Golan in the 1967 War. Most settled in the Rukn al-Din district of the city, where they form the majority of the residents. The main Circassian population center in the area outside Damascus is the village of &lt;a href=\"Marj%20al-Sultan\"&gt;Marj al-Sultan&lt;/a&gt;, 15 kilometers to the city's east. But all Circassians had to leave this village during the Syrian civil war as it was totally destroyed in 2016. Others had previously moved to the Caucasus after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nAleppo city is another major center, in addition to the nearby town of &lt;a href=\"Khanasir\"&gt;Khanasir&lt;/a&gt; from which many of Aleppo's Circassians had emigrated from. Manbij, northeast of Aleppo, also contains a significant Circassian community. In 1970 the Circassian population in Khanasir and Manbij was 2,500 and 1,500, respectively. Khanasir had been reestablished by Circassian immigrants from Manbij at the turn of the 20th century.\nCircassians also reside in seven villages in the &lt;a href=\"Homs%20Governorate\"&gt;Homs Governorate&lt;/a&gt; and two in the &lt;a href=\"Hama%20Governorate\"&gt;Hama Governorate&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the city of &lt;a href=\"Homs\"&gt;Homs&lt;/a&gt; itself. These villages are mostly situated north or east of Homs along the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Desert\"&gt;Syrian Desert&lt;/a&gt; and along the eastern banks of the &lt;a href=\"Orontes%20River\"&gt;Orontes River&lt;/a&gt;. They are &lt;a href=\"Deir%20Ful\"&gt;Deir Ful&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayn%20al-Niser\"&gt;Ayn al-Niser&lt;/a&gt;, Abu Hamama, &lt;a href=\"Murayj%20al-Durr\"&gt;Murayj al-Durr&lt;/a&gt;, Asilah, Anzat, Tell Amri, &lt;a href=\"Tell%20Sinan\"&gt;Tell Sinan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tell%20Ada\"&gt;Tell Ady&lt;/a&gt; and Telil. The last village is located west of Homs, near &lt;a href=\"Houla\"&gt;Houla&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable people.\nNotable Syrian citizens of either full or partial Circassian ancestry include:"
