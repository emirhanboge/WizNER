    "text": "Craig Gillies (born 6 May 1976) is a former &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player. His final club was &lt;a href=\"Worcester%20Warriors\"&gt;Worcester Warriors&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Aviva%20Premiership\"&gt;Aviva Premiership&lt;/a&gt;. He played as a &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%234.%20.26%205.%20Lock\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt;.\nGillies was born in &lt;a href=\"Paisley%2C%20Renfrewshire\"&gt;Paisley&lt;/a&gt; and grew up in &lt;a href=\"Tiverton%2C%20Devon\"&gt;Tiverton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devon\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt;. He joined &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Rugby\"&gt;Bath Rugby&lt;/a&gt; following a trial in April 1994 and made three first team appearances during the 1995\u20131996 season. He moved on to join &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20F.C.\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt; for the 1997\u20131998 season with the then Bath coach &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Robinson\"&gt;Andy Robinson&lt;/a&gt; feeling that the club's signing of the &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Argentinian&lt;/a&gt; international German Llanes would prevent Gillies from getting the sufficient game time to allow him to fully develop his potential. Gillies moved on to join &lt;a href=\"Scarlets\"&gt;Llanelli&lt;/a&gt; before signing for &lt;a href=\"Gloucester%20Rugby\"&gt;Gloucester&lt;/a&gt; in 2001/02 and then &lt;a href=\"Worcester%20Warriors\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 2002.
