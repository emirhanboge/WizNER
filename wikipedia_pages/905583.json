    "text": "Rehoboth (, \"Re\u1e25ovot\"; lit. \"broad places\") is the name of three &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; places:\nNabatean and Byzantine town in the Negev.\nThe town's ruins, called in Arabic \"Khirbet Ruheibeh\", are located in the Wadi er-Ruheibeh area, where Isaac's well was (). This was a thriving city in Byzantine times. In Israel today it is called \"Rehovot ba-Negev\" (Rehovot-in-the-&lt;a href=\"Negev\"&gt;Negev&lt;/a&gt;). It was apparently founded in the first century AD by the &lt;a href=\"Nabateans\"&gt;Nabateans&lt;/a&gt;. It grew to more than 10,000 people by the fifth century, thanks to its being on the &lt;a href=\"Incense%20Route\"&gt;Incense Route&lt;/a&gt;."
