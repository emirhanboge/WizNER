    "text": "This is a list of the 72 cases reported in volume 149 of \"&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Reports\"&gt;United States Reports&lt;/a&gt;\", decided by the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; in 1893.\nJustices of the Supreme Court at the time of volume 149 U.S..\nThe Supreme Court is established by &lt;a href=\"Article%20Three%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;Article III, Section 1&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Constitution of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, which says: \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court . . .\". The size of the Court is not specified; the Constitution leaves it to &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; to set the number of justices. Under the &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201789\"&gt;Judiciary Act of 1789&lt;/a&gt; Congress originally fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices). Since 1789 Congress has varied the size of the Court from six to &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Circuit%20Act%20of%201807\"&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20and%20Ninth%20Circuits%20Act%20of%201837\"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Circuit%20Act%20of%201863\"&gt;ten&lt;/a&gt;, and back to &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201869\"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt; justices (always including one chief justice). \nWhen the cases in volume 149 U.S. were decided the Court comprised the following nine members:\nNotable Cases in 149 U.S..\n\"Nix v.

The provisions in question required Chinese in the United States to obtain certificates of residency, and allowed for the arrest and deportation of Chinese who had failed to obtain these certificates, even if they had not violated any other laws. The case involved writs of \"&lt;a href=\"habeas%20corpus\"&gt;habeas corpus&lt;/a&gt;\" from Fong Yue Ting and two other Chinese citizens residing in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; who were arrested and detained for not having certificates. The Supreme Court decided in favor of the United States government, upholding the Geary Act and denying the writs of habeas corpus.\nCitation style.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201789\"&gt;Judiciary Act of 1789&lt;/a&gt; the federal court structure at the time comprised District Courts, which had general trial jurisdiction; Circuit Courts, which had mixed trial and appellate (from the US District Courts) jurisdiction; and the United States Supreme Court, which had appellate jurisdiction over the federal District and Circuit courts\u2014and for certain issues over state courts. The Supreme Court also had limited &lt;a href=\"Original%20jurisdiction\"&gt;original jurisdiction&lt;/a&gt; (\"i.e.,\" in which cases could be filed directly with the Supreme Court without first having been heard by a lower federal or state court). There were one or more federal District Courts and/or Circuit Courts in each state, territory, or other geographical region.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201891\"&gt;Judiciary Act of 1891&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Courts%20of%20Appeals\"&gt;United States Courts of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; and reassigned the jurisdiction of most routine appeals from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20district%20court\"&gt;district&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20circuit%20court\"&gt;circuit&lt;/a&gt; courts to these appellate courts. The Act created nine new courts that were originally known as the \"United States circuit courts of appeals.\" The new courts had jurisdiction over most appeals of lower court decisions. The Supreme Court could review either legal issues that a court of appeals certified or decisions of court of appeals by &lt;a href=\"writ%20of%20certiorari\"&gt;writ of certiorari&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Bluebook\"&gt;Bluebook&lt;/a&gt; citation style is used for case names, citations, and jurisdictions.
