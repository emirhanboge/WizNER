    "text": "The Croatian Football Cup (), also colloquially known as Rabuzinovo sunce (), is an annually held &lt;a href=\"Football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; tournament for &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"football%20club\"&gt;football club&lt;/a&gt;s and is the second most important competition in Croatian football after the &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20First%20Football%20League\"&gt;Prva HNL&lt;/a&gt; championship. It is governed by the &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Croatian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; (HNS) and usually runs from late August to late May. Cup winners automatically qualify for next season's &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa Conference League&lt;/a&gt;, except when cup winners are also Prva HNL champions, in which case their berth in the Europa Conference League goes to the best placed team in the Prva HNL who haven't qualified for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20competitions\"&gt;UEFA competitions&lt;/a&gt; through their league performance.\nThe cup was established in 1992, after Croatian clubs had abandoned the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav First League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Cup\"&gt;Yugoslav Cup&lt;/a&gt; competitions following the &lt;a href=\"breakup%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;breakup of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. As of the most recent &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Croatian%20Football%20Cup\"&gt;2020\u201321 season&lt;/a&gt; a total of 30 cup seasons were held. The competition has historically been dominated by the two &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20derby%20%28Croatia%29\"&gt;Eternal Derby&lt;/a&gt; sides\u2014the most successful club is &lt;a href=\"GNK%20Dinamo%20Zagreb\"&gt;Dinamo Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known in the 1990s as HA\u0160K Gra\u0111anski and Croatia Zagreb) who appeared in 23 finals and won 16 titles, followed by &lt;a href=\"HNK%20Hajduk%20Split\"&gt;Hajduk Split&lt;/a&gt; who won 6 titles out of 11 finals they appeared in.\nEither Dinamo or Hajduk appeared in all but three cup finals (in &lt;a href=\"1999%20Croatian%20Football%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2006%20Croatian%20Football%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2020%20Croatian%20Football%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;) and only three other clubs have won the cup\u2014&lt;a href=\"HNK%20Rijeka\"&gt;Rijeka&lt;/a&gt; (six wins), &lt;a href=\"NK%20Inter%20Zapre%C5%A1i%C4%87\"&gt;Inter Zapre\u0161i\u0107&lt;/a&gt; (one win) and &lt;a href=\"NK%20Osijek\"&gt;Osijek&lt;/a&gt; (one win). Although clubs can qualify for the cup via regional county cups, which are usually contested by &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20Second%20Football%20League\"&gt;second-&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20Third%20Football%20League\"&gt;third-&lt;/a&gt; or fourth-level sides, &lt;a href=\"NK%20Istra%201961\"&gt;Uljanik Pula&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2003%20Croatian%20Football%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; was the only team in the history of the competition to have reached the cup final from outside the top level.\nFormat.\nEntries.\nAlthough in theory any club can take part in the cup, 48 teams enter the competition proper, based on three criteria:\nCompetition system.\nThe 32 clubs which qualify via regional cups always enter in the preliminary round, which consists of 16 single-legged fixtures. In case of a draw at the end of normal time, thirty minutes of &lt;a href=\"extra%20time\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt; is played, and if scores are still level, a &lt;a href=\"penalty%20shootout%20%28football%29\"&gt;penalty shootout&lt;/a&gt; is held to determine the winner of the tie.\nSixteen winners of the preliminary ties go on to the first round proper (round of 32), where they are joined by the sixteen best-ranked clubs according to cup coefficient (this usually means all &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20First%20Football%20League\"&gt;First League&lt;/a&gt; clubs and a handful of best-ranked lower level teams). Round of 32 (R1) and round of 16 (R2) are also played as single-legged fixtures. Until the 2014\u201315 season, from the quarter-finals onward, the competition employed a &lt;a href=\"two-legged%20tie\"&gt;two-legged tie&lt;/a&gt; format, with winners progressing through on aggregate score. Since 2015\u201316, quarter-finals are also played as single-legged fixtures and, since 2017\u201318, the same applies for semi-finals.\nIn case the score is still level at the end of regular time, extra time is played. If the score remains level after extra time, a penalty shootout takes place to determine tie winners. With the exception of 1997 and 1999 finals, all finals were also played as two-legged fixtures until the rules were most recently changed for the 2014\u201315 season and a single-match final was made permanent.\nCroatian club cup coefficient.\nClubs are awarded points for participation in specific round of the Cup. There are two exceptions in awarding points, first is clubs from preliminary round doesn't receive any points and second is a final where winner receives double of runner up. Points are summed through the season and added to five year ranking.\nPoints used in this ranking will be used for qualification for the 2022\u201323 season and seeding for the season &lt;a href=\"2021%E2%80%9322%20Croatian%20Football%20Cup\"&gt;2021\u201322&lt;/a&gt;.
