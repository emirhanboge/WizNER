    "title": "Permanently shadowed crater",
    "text": "A permanently shadowed crater is a depression on a body in the &lt;a href=\"Solar%20System\"&gt;Solar System&lt;/a&gt; within which lies a point that is always in darkness.\nAs of 2019, there are 324 known permanently shadowed regions on the Moon. Such regions also exist on &lt;a href=\"Mercury%20%28planet%29\"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29\"&gt;Ceres&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nSuch a crater must be located at high &lt;a href=\"latitude\"&gt;latitude&lt;/a&gt; (close to a &lt;a href=\"Poles%20of%20astronomical%20bodies\"&gt;pole&lt;/a&gt;) and be on a body with very small &lt;a href=\"axial%20tilt\"&gt;axial tilt&lt;/a&gt;. The Moon has an axial tilt of about 1.5\u00b0; Mercury, 0.03\u00b0; and Ceres, about 4\u00b0.\nOn the Moon, permanent shadow can exist at latitudes as low as 58\u00b0; approximately 50 permanently shadowed regions exist in the 58\u00b0- 65\u00b0 latitude range for both lunar hemispheres.\nThe cumulative area of permanently shadowed lunar regions is about 31 thousand km2; more than half of it is in the southern hemisphere.\nConditions inside craters.\nCraters of eternal darkness might be advantageous for &lt;a href=\"space%20exploration\"&gt;space exploration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"space%20colonization\"&gt;colonization&lt;/a&gt;, as they preserve sources of water ice that can be converted into drinkable water, breathable oxygen, and rocket propellant. \nSeveral of such craters show indications of water ice in their interiors, including &lt;a href=\"Rozhdestvenskiy%20%28crater%29\"&gt;Rozhdestvenskiy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cabeus%20%28crater%29\"&gt;Cabeus&lt;/a&gt; craters on the Moon, and Juling Crater on Ceres.\nThe craters may also contain unusually high concentrations of &lt;a href=\"helium-3\"&gt;helium-3&lt;/a&gt;.\nA business case analysis indicates that mining of propellants in the craters could become a profitable &lt;a href=\"Commercial%20use%20of%20space\"&gt;commercial enterprise&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn some cases, &lt;a href=\"Peak%20of%20eternal%20light\"&gt;peaks of eternal light&lt;/a&gt; are located nearby, that could be advantageous for solar power generation. For example, there are 2 peaks near &lt;a href=\"Shackleton%20Crater\"&gt;Shackleton Crater&lt;/a&gt; that are illuminated a combined ~94% of a lunar year.\nPermanently shadowed regions have a stable surface temperature. On the Moon, the temperature hovers somewhere at or below 50 Kelvin. Another temperatures estimate is 25 K to 70 K. The low temperatures make the regions desirable locations for future infrared telescopes.\nOn the other hand, computer simulations show that powerful solar storms can charge up the soil in permanently shadowed regions near the lunar poles, and may possibly produce \"sparks\" that could vaporize and melt the soil.\nThere are other unique challenges of such regions: dark environments that restrict the ability of rovers to perceive their surroundings, cryogenic regolith that could be hard to move on, and communication interruptions.\nPlanetary protection.\nIn 2020, NASA assigned \"sensitive location\" status to the Moon's permanently shadowed regions to avoid their contamination.\nList.\nBelow is an incomplete list of such craters:\nThe Moon:\nMercury:\n&lt;a href=\"Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29\"&gt;Ceres&lt;/a&gt;:\nResearch missions.\nPast.\nIn 2009, &lt;a href=\"LCROSS\"&gt;LCROSS&lt;/a&gt; sent an impactor into a Cabeus crater, that resulted in detection of water in the ejected material.\nIn 2012, The Lyman Alpha Mapping Project aboard NASA's &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Reconnaissance%20Orbiter\"&gt;Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/a&gt; has found that the permanently shadowed regions have a porous, powdery surface, that indicates the presence of water ice.\nIn 2018, an analysis of the results of the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Mineralogy%20Mapper\"&gt;Moon Mineralogy Mapper&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the existence of water ice deposits in permanently shadowed craters and crevices, with more abundance near the south pole.\nPlanned.\nThe proposed &lt;a href=\"International%20Lunar%20Observatory\"&gt;International Lunar Observatory&lt;/a&gt; mission involves a landing near the Malapert crater.\n&lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Flashlight\"&gt;Lunar Flashlight&lt;/a&gt; is planned to launch in 2021 as a secondary payload for the &lt;a href=\"Artemis%201\"&gt;Artemis 1&lt;/a&gt; mission.\nA camera called ShadowCam is being built that will be able to take high-resolution images of Permanently Shadowed Regions. It is a NASA instrument that will fly on board the &lt;a href=\"Korea%20Pathfinder%20Lunar%20Orbiter\"&gt;Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter&lt;/a&gt; (KPLO) in 2022."
