    "title": "Blue hair",
    "text": "Blue hair does not naturally occur in &lt;a href=\"Human%20hair%20color\"&gt;human hair pigmentation&lt;/a&gt;, although the hair of some animals (such as &lt;a href=\"coat%20%28dog%29\"&gt;dog coats&lt;/a&gt;) is described as blue. Some humans are born with bluish-black hair (also known as \"blue black\" hair), which is black that has a blue hue under the light.\nBlue hair has a long history of artistic and literary uses.\nFashion.\nThe 18th-century English politician &lt;a href=\"Charles%20James%20Fox\"&gt;Charles Fox&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"macaroni%20%28fashion%29\"&gt;fashionable macaroni&lt;/a&gt; in his youth and tinted his hair with blue powder.\nIn 1913\u20131914, just before &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, there was a vogue for dyed brightly-colored hair in different shades such as blue, violet or emerald. This started in Paris and then spread to other cities such as London. In 1924, the first celebrity hairstylist, &lt;a href=\"Monsieur%20Antoine\"&gt;Monsieur Antoine&lt;/a&gt;, dyed his dog's hair blue. An influential client, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Elsie%20De%20Wolfe%20Mendl\"&gt;Lady Elsie De Wolfe Mendl&lt;/a&gt;, took up the same style and this started a new fad. Later in the 20th century, mature ladies had a &lt;a href=\"blue%20rinse\"&gt;blue rinse&lt;/a&gt; to conceal &lt;a href=\"grey%20hair\"&gt;grey hair&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother\"&gt;Queen Mother&lt;/a&gt; was the trend-setter and the peak of popularity for this fashion was the period following &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 2007 fall fashion season, designers such as &lt;a href=\"Marc%20Jacobs\"&gt;Marc Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duckie%20Brown\"&gt;Duckie Brown&lt;/a&gt; dyed the hair of their models blue to give them a shocking &lt;a href=\"Punk%20fashion\"&gt;punk&lt;/a&gt; look. In 2011, the blue rinse became fashionable again and exemplars included &lt;a href=\"Kate%20Bosworth\"&gt;Kate Bosworth&lt;/a&gt; with a dip-dyed style of turquoise tips while &lt;a href=\"Thakoon%20Panichgul\"&gt;Thakoon Panichgul&lt;/a&gt; continued to present models with startling, all-blue hair.\nA synthetic dye used to color hair blue was &lt;a href=\"anthraquinone\"&gt;1,4,5,8-tetraaminoanthraquinone&lt;/a&gt; prepared as \"Disperse Blue 1\" with water and &lt;a href=\"lignosulfonates\"&gt;lignosuphonate&lt;/a&gt; dispersant. This is a semi-permanent dye as the dye molecules do not penetrate the hair shaft and so wash out in subsequent shampooing. It is not used in the U.S. as it is thought to be carcinogenic.\nOccupational causes.\nThe hair of workers who regularly come into close contact with &lt;a href=\"cobalt\"&gt;cobalt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"indigo\"&gt;indigo&lt;/a&gt; may become blue because of the dust of the substance mixing into the &lt;a href=\"hair%20follicle\"&gt;hair follicle&lt;/a&gt;s. The colour in these cases is \"not merely superficial\", but an actual coloration of the hair.\nStereotyping and stigma.\nOld women are often referred to as \"blue hairs\". In addition, detractors of &lt;a href=\"feminism\"&gt;feminism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"social%20justice%20warrior\"&gt;social justice warrior&lt;/a&gt;sparticularly those supportive of &lt;a href=\"Social%20conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; politicsare prone to identifying their ideological opponents via references to blue hair.\n71% of the U.S. adults polled by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor\"&gt;The Christian Science Monitor&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2002 explained they would not allow a 12-year-old to dye their hair blue. The social dislike of the hair color can lead to a suspension from school and the loss of a job, among other things. The \"blue hair effect\" has been used as a metaphor for &lt;a href=\"social%20distance\"&gt;social distancing&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor example, a man who worked for a hospital for 10 years was fired for coming to work with blue hair after refusing to dye it back to its normal color. In two cases that were followed by lawsuits, students in the U.S. and Canada were sanctioned for dying their hair blue. The &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union\"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; intervened in the American case.\nAnimals.\nSome varieties of &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt; have been bred with blue hair such as the Belgian breed, the \"St Nicholas Blue\". This was a light &lt;a href=\"sky%20blue\"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt; in color with a white blaze. Other breeds of blue rabbit are darker and there are about 45 different shades or textures recognised by show judges.\nThere are several breeds of dogs which may have a blue coat including the &lt;a href=\"Kerry%20Blue%20Terrier\"&gt;Kerry Blue Terrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bluetick%20Coonhound\"&gt;Bluetick Coonhound&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Bleu%20de%20Gascogne\"&gt;Grand Bleu de Gascogne&lt;/a&gt;. This arises in two main ways: from a dilution or silvering of a black coat so that it is seen as &lt;a href=\"bluish%20grey\"&gt;blue-grey&lt;/a&gt;; or from a &lt;a href=\"merle%20%28coat%20colour%20in%20dogs%29\"&gt;mottling&lt;/a&gt; or marbling effect which mixes black and white to be seen as &lt;a href=\"navy%20blue\"&gt;navy blue&lt;/a&gt;. Dogs with blue coats are often prone to skin allergies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wool\"&gt;fleece&lt;/a&gt; of sheep may be a natural blue-grey, such as the &lt;a href=\"bharal\"&gt;Himalayan blue sheep&lt;/a&gt;, or may be dyed blue as a &lt;a href=\"raddle\"&gt;raddle&lt;/a&gt; or to make them more conspicuous in snowy conditions.\nThe coat of several other animals is called blue, including those of &lt;a href=\"Roan%20%28horse%29\"&gt;blue roan&lt;/a&gt; horses, the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Blue\"&gt;Russian Blue&lt;/a&gt; cat, and the blue variant of the &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20fox\"&gt;Arctic fox&lt;/a&gt;'s coat.\nArtistic representations.\nPictures.\nBlue hair has been described as a \"sacred aesthetic\" in &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt; was used in funerary art and statuary.\nMany colored pictorials from the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt; tribes after the departure of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; troops feature women with blue hair. According to &lt;a href=\"Gale%20Owen-Crocker\"&gt;Gale R. Owen-Crocker&lt;/a&gt; in \"Dress in Anglo-Saxon England\" \"the use of colour in Anglo-Saxon art is not realistic ... and there is no need to assume dye was used on the hair.\"\nRepresentations of the &lt;a href=\"Buddha\"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; often feature blue hair, sometimes of a brilliant hue. This artistic convention emphasizes the blue element in the 'blue-black' hair said to be one of the 32 special &lt;a href=\"physical%20characteristics%20of%20the%20Buddha\"&gt;physical characteristics of the Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. Traces of ancient blue pigment could be seen in the hair grooves of some of the 4-6C Buddhas known as the 'Qingzhou Buddhas' found in an ancient schoolyard pit in China in Qingzhou (&lt;a href=\"Shandong\"&gt;Shandong&lt;/a&gt;) in 1996, shown on exhibit in London and many other world capitals.\nLiterary works.\nIn some works by &lt;a href=\"Homer\"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt;, characters are said to have dark blue (\"&lt;a href=\"cyan\"&gt;kyaneos&lt;/a&gt;\") hair or eyebrows when they are angry or in an emotionally intense state. For example, &lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;' beard became black blue when he was transformed by &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; upon returning home to confront his wife's suitors. Other Greek gods were also shown as having blue hair. This imagery may stem from &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20mythology\"&gt;Egyptian myth&lt;/a&gt;, in which their gods were said to have hair of &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;. In a similar vein, characters from the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Eve\"&gt;Eve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rachel\"&gt;Rachel&lt;/a&gt;, are often depicted with a \"sky-blue\" colour of hair.\nColour in ancient Greece and Egypt were also more expressive rather than natural: blue or gold indicated divinity due to its unnatural appearance and association with precious materials.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Fairy%20with%20Turquoise%20Hair\"&gt;The Fairy with Turquoise Hair&lt;/a&gt; is a major character in &lt;a href=\"Pinocchio\"&gt;Pinocchio&lt;/a&gt;. She is often titled as the \"Child with the Blue Hair\" and even has a chapter in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adventures%20of%20Pinocchio\"&gt;The Adventures of Pinocchio&lt;/a&gt;\" devoted to this title. Literary critics have offered varied interpretations of her hair color. It may invoke associations with \"the ineffable or infinite\", with the Italian sky, or with the &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Mary\"&gt;Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt;, who is often shown with a blue mantle.\nThe color blue owned aristocratic associations in Europe during the second millennium, and this linkage with &lt;a href=\"Nobility\"&gt;blue blood&lt;/a&gt; was reflected in &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Perrault\"&gt;Charles Perrault&lt;/a&gt;'s story of \"&lt;a href=\"Bluebeard\"&gt;Bluebeard&lt;/a&gt;\". In &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Tatar\"&gt;Maria Tatar&lt;/a&gt;'s view, the color of his beard suggests otherworldly origins.\nIn pop culture.\nMusic.\nMusicians &lt;a href=\"Katy%20Perry\"&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Gaga\"&gt;Lady Gaga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halsey%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Halsey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alissa%20White-Gluz\"&gt;Alissa White-Gluz&lt;/a&gt; have dyed their hair blue.\nOther visual media.\nThe cartoon character &lt;a href=\"Marge%20Simpson\"&gt;Marge Simpson&lt;/a&gt; is depicted as having blue hair. Jok Church's character, &lt;a href=\"You%20Can%20With%20Beakman%20and%20Jax\"&gt;Beakman&lt;/a&gt;, also has blue hair, which is a throwback reference, according to the creator, to an older version of &lt;a href=\"Superman\"&gt;Superman&lt;/a&gt;, who also had a blue tint to his hair.\n&lt;a href=\"Anime\"&gt;Anime&lt;/a&gt; characters sometimes have blue hair, including &lt;a href=\"Bulma\"&gt;Bulma&lt;/a&gt; of the popular \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Ball\"&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/a&gt;\" series,&lt;a href=\"Mana%20Takamiya\"&gt;Mana Takamiya&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Date%20A%20Live\"&gt;Date A Live&lt;/a&gt;\" series, &lt;a href=\"Sailor%20Mercury\"&gt;Sailor Mercury&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Sailor%20Moon\"&gt;Sailor Moon&lt;/a&gt;\" series and &lt;a href=\"Rei%20Ayanami\"&gt;Rei Ayanami&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Neon%20Genesis%20Evangelion\"&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/a&gt;\". One author, in writing of Rei, sees her hair color as a marker of both her 'unearthliness' and her &lt;a href=\"introversion\"&gt;introversion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Strong%20Bad\"&gt;Strong Bad&lt;/a&gt;, from the animated webseries \"&lt;a href=\"Homestar%20Runner\"&gt;Homestar Runner&lt;/a&gt;\", lampshades this trend by stating emphatically that in order to be a proper anime character, \"You gotta have blue hair!\"\nThe 2010 graphic novel \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Is%20the%20Warmest%20Color%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Blue Is the Warmest Color&lt;/a&gt;\" and its 2013 &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Is%20the%20Warmest%20Colour\"&gt;movie adaptation&lt;/a&gt; features a lesbian relationship between a teenage girl and an art student with blue hair."
