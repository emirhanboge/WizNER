    "text": "Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Nilofar was, at the time, the third-&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20the%20most%20intense%20tropical%20cyclones\"&gt;strongest cyclone&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20Sea\"&gt;Arabian Sea&lt;/a&gt;. In late October 2014, it reached peak &lt;a href=\"maximum%20sustained%20wind\"&gt;maximum sustained wind&lt;/a&gt;s estimated between and . The &lt;a href=\"India%20Meteorological%20Department\"&gt;India Meteorological Department&lt;/a&gt; (IMD) &lt;a href=\"tropical%20cyclone%20naming\"&gt;named it&lt;/a&gt; \"Nilofar\"; the name refers to the &lt;a href=\"Nymphaea\"&gt;water lily&lt;/a&gt;, and was suggested by &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Meteorological%20Department\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. The western fringes of the storm caused &lt;a href=\"flash%20flood\"&gt;flash flood&lt;/a&gt;ing in northeastern &lt;a href=\"Oman\"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt;, killing four people.\nNilofar originated from a &lt;a href=\"low-pressure%20area\"&gt;low-pressure area&lt;/a&gt; between India and the Arabian Peninsula. It developed into a depression on October\u00a025 and moved generally northward through an area of favorable conditions. The system intensified into a &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23North%20Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;cyclonic storm&lt;/a&gt; on October\u00a026. Quickly organizing due to the conditions, Nilofar developed a well-defined &lt;a href=\"eye%20%28cyclone%29\"&gt;eye&lt;/a&gt; and structure, attaining its peak intensity on October\u00a028. At the time, Nilofar was expected to make &lt;a href=\"landfall\"&gt;landfall&lt;/a&gt; in western India, prompting evacuations and preparations. However, high &lt;a href=\"wind%20shear\"&gt;wind shear&lt;/a&gt; caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and Nilofar degraded into a remnant low-pressure area on October\u00a031 off the Indian state of &lt;a href=\"Gujarat\"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeteorological history.\nToward the middle of October 2014, the &lt;a href=\"monsoon%20trough\"&gt;monsoon trough&lt;/a&gt; was active over the &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20Sea\"&gt;Arabian Sea&lt;/a&gt; off the west coast of India. A circulation formed on October\u00a019 near the &lt;a href=\"Lakshadweep\"&gt;Lakshadweep&lt;/a&gt; archipelago, remaining nearly stationary for several days. It developed a distinct &lt;a href=\"low-pressure%20area\"&gt;low-pressure area&lt;/a&gt; on October\u00a021, and produced an intense area of &lt;a href=\"convection%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;convection&lt;/a&gt; by the next day. Despite moderate &lt;a href=\"wind%20shear\"&gt;wind shear&lt;/a&gt;, conditions favored further &lt;a href=\"tropical%20cyclogenesis\"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt;, including warm water temperatures and good &lt;a href=\"outflow%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;outflow&lt;/a&gt;, amplified by an &lt;a href=\"anticyclone\"&gt;anticyclone&lt;/a&gt; to its east-northeast. The structure became more organized by October\u00a024, when broken &lt;a href=\"rainband\"&gt;rainband&lt;/a&gt;s were rotating around a poorly-defined circulation. That day, the American-based &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center\"&gt;Joint Typhoon Warning Center&lt;/a&gt; (JTWC) classified it as a tropical depression, although the agency did not issue warnings at the time. At 00:00\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Coordinated%20Universal%20Time\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; on October\u00a025, the &lt;a href=\"India%20Meteorological%20Department\"&gt;India Meteorological Department&lt;/a&gt; (IMD) classified the system as a depression about 1270\u00a0km (790\u00a0mi) southeast of &lt;a href=\"Muscat%2C%20Oman\"&gt;Muscat, Oman&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the system first formed, it benefited from warm water temperatures of and a favorable phase of the &lt;a href=\"Madden%E2%80%93Julian%20oscillation\"&gt;Madden\u2013Julian oscillation&lt;/a&gt;. Moderate wind shear and continued interaction with the monsoon dislocated the bulk of the deepest convection to the western periphery. By 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a025, the system organized enough for the JTWC to classify it as Tropical Cyclone 04A, and there were hints of an &lt;a href=\"eye%20%28cyclone%29\"&gt;eye feature&lt;/a&gt; within the thunderstorms. By the time of classification, the storm was moving to the northeast, steered by the &lt;a href=\"subtropical%20ridge\"&gt;subtropical ridge&lt;/a&gt; to the south, although the motion slowed on October\u00a026 due to competing influence of another subtropical ridge to the northwest. That day, the system strengthened quickly; the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression at 03:00\u00a0UTC, to Cyclonic Storm Nilofar at 06:00\u00a0UTC, and further to a &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23North%20Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;severe cyclonic storm&lt;/a&gt; at 21:00\u00a0UTC. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a027, the JTWC upgraded Nilofar to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, based on the development of a 54\u00a0km (33\u00a0mi) eye. Throughout that day, the cyclone turned more to the northwest as a ridge built to the east, while the inner core of convection became more symmetrical and compact. Also by that time, &lt;a href=\"tropical%20cyclone%20forecast%20model\"&gt;tropical cyclone forecast model&lt;/a&gt;s anticipated that Nilofar would eventually recurve to the northeast and make &lt;a href=\"landfall\"&gt;landfall&lt;/a&gt; in western India.\nAt 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a027, the IMD upgraded Nilofar to a very severe cyclonic storm. The storm was &lt;a href=\"rapid%20intensification\"&gt;rapidly intensifying&lt;/a&gt; at the time, after the wind shear had decreased, and the eye contracted to a diameter of 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi). At 09:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a028, the IMD upgraded Nilofar further to an extremely severe cyclonic storm. Six hours later, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of ; at the time, the agency anticipated further strengthening due to the favorable conditions and good organization. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a028, the IMD estimated peak 3-minute winds of . At the time, it was the third-strongest storm on record in the Arabian Sea. On October\u00a029, Nilofar started weakening due to increased wind shear, and the convection diminished in intensity. At the same time, the storm turned northeastward while rounding the ridge to the east. Increasingly cooler and drier air, as well as cooler waters, caused the storm to degrade rapidly. The eye, previously small and well defined, dissipated by 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a029. Later that day, the center began decoupling from the convection, a sign of rapid weakening, and by 21:00\u00a0UTC the IMD downgraded it to a severe cyclonic storm. Early on October\u00a030, the JTWC downgraded Nilofar to a tropical storm, and subsequently the circulation became exposed from the convection. At 18:00\u00a0UTC that day, the JTWC posted their final advisory. Nilofar weakened further into a depression on October\u00a031, and soon after degenerated into a remnant low off coast of the Indian state of &lt;a href=\"Gujarat\"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreparations and impact.\nOffshore buoys recorded 3.2\u00a0m (10.5\u00a0ft) waves and winds of 41\u00a0km/h (25\u00a0mph). The outskirts of the storm caused flash flooding in &lt;a href=\"Al-Rustaq\"&gt;Al-Rustaq&lt;/a&gt; in northeastern Oman, killing four people after a vehicle was swept away in a flooded &lt;a href=\"wadi\"&gt;wadi&lt;/a&gt;. Five people were rescued when another car was stranded amid floods west of Al-Rustaq.\nIn the storm's developmental stages, the outskirts of Nilofar dropped of rainfall in &lt;a href=\"Margao\"&gt;Margao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goa\"&gt;Goa&lt;/a&gt;, helping the state record its wettest October in four years. Other nearby areas along India's west coast received heavy rainfall. The threat of the storm prompted officials to evacuate nearly 30,000\u00a0people in western India, utilizing 200\u00a0storm shelters. Most of the displaced people were living in thatched huts and weak structures. In coastal areas, schools were canceled for two days. Most of the evacuees quickly returned home after the storm weakened. To minimize damage, trees were trimmed down to eliminate damage due to falling debris, and a total suspension of fishing activities was ordered, with about 5,000\u00a0boats advised to return to port. Officials in Gujarat sent a warning of the storm to all operators of &lt;a href=\"Amateur%20radio\"&gt;ham radios&lt;/a&gt;. A distant warning signal 2 was hoisted in the ports of &lt;a href=\"Kandla\"&gt;Kandla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mundra\"&gt;Mundra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"National%20Disaster%20Response%20Force\"&gt;National Disaster Response Force&lt;/a&gt; deployed rescue and rehabilitation teams at &lt;a href=\"Gandhidham\"&gt;Gandhidham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarka\"&gt;Dwarka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Porbandar\"&gt;Porbandar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veraval\"&gt;Veraval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rajkot\"&gt;Rajkot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bhuj\"&gt;Bhuj&lt;/a&gt; while standby teams were stationed at &lt;a href=\"Ahmedabad\"&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vadodara\"&gt;Vadodara&lt;/a&gt;. After facing problems during &lt;a href=\"2014%20India%E2%80%93Pakistan%20floods\"&gt;deadly floods&lt;/a&gt; in September and &lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20Hudhud\"&gt;Cyclone Hudhud&lt;/a&gt; in October, mobile companies enacted greater preparations during Nilofar to guarantee operations during the storm, including an emergency hotline, setting up internet in shelters, and mobile cell towers. Despite the threat from the storm, Nilofar only produced light rainfall and gusty winds along the Gujarat coast. Unseasonable rainfall damaged mangoes in &lt;a href=\"Maharashtra\"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt;, causing prices to rise. Shifting air patterns brought cooler temperatures to western India, signaling the end of the monsoon season, while also bringing haze and smog over &lt;a href=\"Delhi\"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt; from polluting areas to the south.\nIn Pakistan, fishermen were also warned to avoid the sea, and people in coastal areas were evacuated. The country's &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Navy\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;coast guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maritime%20Security%20Agency\"&gt;Maritime Security Agency&lt;/a&gt;, and fishermen organizations helped rescue fishermen stationed offshore. Along the coast of &lt;a href=\"Sindh\"&gt;Sindh&lt;/a&gt; province, bathing and swimming were banned for several days. There were minor power outages in &lt;a href=\"Karachi\"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt; due to heavy rainfall from Nilofar."
