    "text": "Corn Springs is a &lt;a href=\"oasis\"&gt;palm oasis&lt;/a&gt; situated in the &lt;a href=\"Chuckwalla%20Mountains\"&gt;Chuckwalla Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Desert\"&gt;Colorado Desert&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riverside%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;Riverside County, California&lt;/a&gt;, United States, seventeen miles southeast of &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Center%2C%20California\"&gt;Desert Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; relied on the springs, and they engraved many &lt;a href=\"petroglyphs\"&gt;petroglyphs&lt;/a&gt; on the rocks in the area. In the late 19th century, miners in the area also relied on the springs, and they established the Corn Springs Mining District in 1897.\nThe springs were added to the United States &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1998.\nHistory.\nThe springs were used for thousands of years by nomadic &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Chemehuevi\"&gt;Chemehuevi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cahuilla\"&gt;Desert Cahuilla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yuma%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Yuma&lt;/a&gt; bands frequented the spring and carved elaborate &lt;a href=\"petroglyphs\"&gt;petroglyphs&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby rocks. Some of the oldest rock art is over 10,000 years old. At times, there was enough surface water for &lt;a href=\"gardening\"&gt;gardening&lt;/a&gt; by the springs. The Indians also utilized the fruit of the palms.\nEarly white visitors found feral &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;corn&lt;/a&gt; plants in the vicinity, giving the spring its present name.\nIn the late 19th century, miners came to the area and used the water for processing their gold ore. The most notable resident of the spring was Gus Lederer, the self-proclaimed \"Mayor of Corn Springs\". Lederer lived at the spring until 1932, when he died from a &lt;a href=\"Latrodectus%20hesperus\"&gt;black widow spider&lt;/a&gt; bite, and was subsequently buried at &lt;a href=\"Aztec%20Wells\"&gt;Aztec Wells&lt;/a&gt;\". Following Lederer's death in 1932, the land passed into public domain and the &lt;a href=\"Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management\"&gt;Bureau of Land Management&lt;/a&gt; (BLM) established a campground.\nA BLM-run campground, with a well for drawing water from the spring, was established nearby. One mile past the camp ground is a miner's cabin and the remains of one of the mills. &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Wodetzki\"&gt;Edward Wodetzki&lt;/a&gt; and family mined this area until the early 1980s. At the time they had numerous gold, silver, and iron ore claims. More mines and cabins are located further up the road.\nGeography.\nThe area is located on the USGS \"Corn Spring, California\", 7.5-minute quadrangle (1981) at latitude/longitude . Over 60 &lt;a href=\"California%20Fan%20Palm\"&gt;California Fan Palm&lt;/a&gt;s surround the &lt;a href=\"spring%20%28hydrosphere%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;. Typically there is no surface flow, but the wash that drains the area is named the Corn Springs Wash.\nThe spring is dynamic, and for unknown reasons the amount of water coming to the surface has fluctuated widely over the years. The source of the water is unknown \u2013 very little rain falls in the area, and the nearest body of water is the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20River\"&gt;Colorado River&lt;/a&gt;, over 40 miles to the east.\nThe spring can be reached via Corn Springs Road from Chuckawalla Valley Road just off &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2010\"&gt;Interstate 10&lt;/a&gt;, about halfway between &lt;a href=\"Indio%2C%20California\"&gt;Indio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blythe%2C%20California\"&gt;Blythe&lt;/a&gt;."
