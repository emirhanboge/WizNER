    "text": "Iquitos (; ) is the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Maynas%20Province%2C%20Peru\"&gt;Maynas Province&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loreto%20Region\"&gt;Loreto Region&lt;/a&gt;. The largest &lt;a href=\"metropolis\"&gt;metropolis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Amazon\"&gt;Peruvian Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, east of the Andes, it is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Peru\"&gt;ninth-most populous city of Peru&lt;/a&gt;. It is the largest city in the world that cannot be reached by road \u2013 it is accessible only by river and air.\nIt is known as the \"capital of the Peruvian Amazon\". The city is located in the Great Plains of the Amazon Basin, fed by the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20River\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nanay%20River\"&gt;Nanay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Itaya%20River\"&gt;Itaya&lt;/a&gt; rivers. Overall, it constitutes the &lt;a href=\"Iquitos%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Iquitos metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;, a conurbation of 471,993 inhabitants consisting of four districts: &lt;a href=\"Iquitos%20District\"&gt;Iquitos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Punchana%20District\"&gt;Punchana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bel%C3%A9n%20District%2C%20Maynas\"&gt;Bel\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20Bautista%20District%2C%20Maynas\"&gt;San Juan Bautista&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe area was long inhabited by indigenous peoples. The founding date of the European city is uncertain. Spanish historical documents state that it was set up around 1757 as a Spanish &lt;a href=\"Jesuit%20reduction\"&gt;Jesuit reduction&lt;/a&gt; by the banks of the Nanay River. The Jesuits gathered local Napeano (&lt;a href=\"Yameo\"&gt;Yameo&lt;/a&gt;) and Iquito natives to live here, and they named it \"San Pablo de Napeanos\".\nIn the late 19th century, during the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20rubber%20boom\"&gt;Amazon rubber boom&lt;/a&gt;, the city became the center of export of rubber production from the Amazon Basin and was the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Amazon%20Company\"&gt;Peruvian Amazon Company&lt;/a&gt; (PAC). The city's economy was highly dependent on the PAC, controlled in the nation by Peruvian businessman &lt;a href=\"Julio%20C%C3%A9sar%20Arana\"&gt;Julio C\u00e9sar Arana&lt;/a&gt;. PAC kept indigenous workers in near slavery conditions through use of force and harsh treatment, until an investigation caused a reaction against the company. In addition, rubber seedlings had been smuggled out of the country and cultivated on plantations in Southeast Asia, undercutting prices of the Peruvian product. With the decline of the rubber industry, many workers and merchants left Iquitos.\nAs one of the leading cities, along with &lt;a href=\"Manaus\"&gt;Manaus&lt;/a&gt;, in the huge Amazon rubber boom (1880\u20131914), Iquitos was influenced by the numerous Europeans who flocked to it. Architecture and cultural institutions established during this period expressed their own traditions. An opera house and Jewish cemetery were among the institutions established.\nLater in the 20th century, the city and region diversified its economy. The region exported timber, fish and their products, oil, minerals, and agricultural crops. It also derives revenue from tourism and related crafts. By 1999, the city had consolidated its four municipalities.\nHistory.\nEarly period.\nThe area was inhabited for thousands of years by &lt;a href=\"Amerindian\"&gt;Amerindian&lt;/a&gt;s. At the time of European encounter, the Napeano and &lt;a href=\"Iquito\"&gt;Iquito&lt;/a&gt; peoples occupied the area. They had small seasonal settlements and were nomadic hunter-gatherers, living in close association with the rivers. The city name of Iquitos is derived from a group of native people called Iquitos by the Spaniards. They had previously inhabited areas along the rivers &lt;a href=\"Pastaza%20River\"&gt;Pastaza&lt;/a&gt;, Arabela, &lt;a href=\"Tigre%20River\"&gt;Tigre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nanay%20River\"&gt;Nanay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Curaray%20River\"&gt;Curaray&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the native Iquito migrated to the area around the rivers Nanay, Amazonas, Itaya, and the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Moronacocha\"&gt;Lake Moronacocha&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween 1638 to 1769, the Iquitos and other native tribes of the Mara\u00f1on rivers were obliged to settle down in various Missions (known as \"reducciones\" or reductions) founded and run by &lt;a href=\"Jesuit\"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt; missionaries from the Audiencia of Quito. The Jesuits settled in the major cities of the Audiencia of Quito, which was part of the &lt;a href=\"Viceroyalty%20of%20New%20Granada\"&gt;Viceroyalty of New Granada&lt;/a&gt; at the time. During this period of nearly 130 years, 161 Jesuit missionaries worked to convert and educate the natives of the Amazon region. Among them were 63 &lt;a href=\"criollo%20people\"&gt;criollos&lt;/a&gt; (white ethnic Spanish colonists born in the Audencia), 43 &lt;a href=\"Spaniard\"&gt;Spaniard&lt;/a&gt;s, 32 &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20people\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;, 20 &lt;a href=\"Italian%20people\"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt;, 2 &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20people\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, and 1 &lt;a href=\"French%20people\"&gt;Frenchman&lt;/a&gt;. Their role in South America was to convert the natives of the Amazon Basin to Christianity. The Jesuits successfully gathered the natives living along the Mara\u00f1on river into various Jesuit &lt;a href=\"Mission%20%28station%29\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;, where they were set to work at farming and other pursuits.\nCommencing in 1730, the Jesuits took 37 years to found the Iquitos missions along the Mara\u00f1on River, close to the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Napo%20River\"&gt;Napo&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon rivers. These were collectively known as Iquitos Missions, since all these settlements were mainly populated chiefly by the Iquitos natives of the region. The naming and foundation of all the Iquitos Missions were done by Jesuit Father &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Bahamonde\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Bahamonde&lt;/a&gt;. He was born in &lt;a href=\"Quito\"&gt;Quito&lt;/a&gt; on 1 January 1710, accepted into the Jesuit order, and served as a missionary for decades. After &lt;a href=\"Charles%20III%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Charles III of Spain&lt;/a&gt; suppressed and expelled the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Society of Jesus&lt;/a&gt; from South America in 1767, Bahamonde was exiled to Italy, where he died in &lt;a href=\"Ravenna\"&gt;Ravenna&lt;/a&gt;, Italy on 11 May 1786.\nThe following is a chronological list of noted Iquitos Missions founded by Bahamonde and other Jesuits:\nDuring the Spanish Colonial era, most of the Jesuit missions were under the jurisdiction of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Audiencia%20of%20Quito\"&gt;Royal Audiencia of Quito&lt;/a&gt;. Created in 1563, it was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Viceroyalty%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Viceroyalty of Peru&lt;/a&gt;, and was transferred briefly to the &lt;a href=\"Viceroyalty%20of%20New%20Granada\"&gt;Viceroyalty of New Granada&lt;/a&gt; on 27 May 1717 known as the Cedula Real of 1717 (Royal Decree of 1717). Six and a half years later, on 5 November 1723, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20V%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Philip V of Spain&lt;/a&gt; dissolved the Viceroyalty of New Granada and reincorporated the Audiencia of Quito into the Viceroyalty of Peru. Sixteen years later &lt;a href=\"Philip%20V%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Philip V of Spain&lt;/a&gt; decided to re-create the Viceroyalty of New Granada and to re incorporate the Audiencia of Quito through the \"Cedula Real\" (Royal Decree) dated 20 August 1739. &lt;a href=\"Charles%20III%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Charles III of Spain&lt;/a&gt; suppressed the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Society of Jesus&lt;/a&gt;, believing them too powerful, and expelled them from South America by order dated 20 August 1767. Given the distance from Quito and the lack of roads connecting to that city, a political vacuum was developed in the area. The undefended Jesuit missions were attacked by the Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Bandeirantes\"&gt;Bandeirantes&lt;/a&gt;. In response the King of Spain on recommendation of &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Raquena\"&gt;Francisco Raquena&lt;/a&gt; created the Government and Commandancy General of Maynas in 1802 to halt the invasion into the Spanish Amazon of land-hungry &lt;a href=\"mestizo\"&gt;mestizo&lt;/a&gt; Portuguese &lt;a href=\"Bandeirantes\"&gt;Bandeirantes&lt;/a&gt;. In general, this amounted to the religious administration and military command of all tributaries of the Amazon river in the Amazon Basin that belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Audiencia%20of%20Quito\"&gt;Royal Audiencia of Quito&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Viceroyalty%20of%20New%20Granada\"&gt;Viceroyalty of New Granada&lt;/a&gt; being transferred again to the &lt;a href=\"Viceroyalty%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Viceroyalty of Peru&lt;/a&gt;. The Portuguese advance was halted at &lt;a href=\"Tabatinga\"&gt;Tabatinga&lt;/a&gt;.\n19th century: independence.\nIn the early 19th century, following independence, &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, and Brazil had overlapping claims to the Northwestern &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Basin\"&gt;Amazon Basin&lt;/a&gt;, based on each country's interpretation of their colonial \"de jure\" titles. The disputed area was populated mostly by groups of nomadic Amerindian natives living in the Amazon jungle. In addition there were semi-assimilated sedentary Amerindians living with a handful of whites and mestizos, dedicated to trading in sparsely populated trading port villages that were found scattered along the river banks of the Amazon Basin. During the colonial era the disputed area known as Maynas had numerous missions administered by the Jesuits of Quito. After the Jesuits were expelled from South America, only a handful of missions survived in the 19th century as isolated trading villages. The Brazilians, by contrast, had a chain of villages along the Amazon River that stretched to its ports along the Atlantic Ocean.\nBecause Peru discovered that Ecuador and Colombia neglected to effectively control their Amazonian territories during their colonial era, Peru decided to back its &lt;a href=\"de%20jure\"&gt;de jure&lt;/a&gt; titles with &lt;a href=\"de%20facto\"&gt;de facto&lt;/a&gt; possession by setting up military posts in the relatively isolated trading villages and then flooding the disputed area with Peruvian colonists. The only problem lay with the expanding ambitions of Brazil, since it had slowly settled its part of the disputed area with colonists throughout its colonial era; it had a trading relationship with the Spanish-speaking trading posts and villages along the Mara\u00f1on River. To neutralize Brazil from impeding Peru's planned colonization project, on 23 October 1851, Peru peacefully settled its disputes with Brazil and both countries agreed to a bilateral free navigation and friendly trade along the Amazon River.\nAs a result of the Peruvian-Brazilian treaty, the Peruvian President &lt;a href=\"Ramon%20Castilla\"&gt;Ramon Castilla&lt;/a&gt; created the Military and Political Department of Loreto on 7 January 1861 from the former Maynas territory. Castilla ordered that a fluvial port be constructed in a strategic spot on the Amazon River. After some debate, his staff chose the trading port Village of Iquitos. On 5 January 1864, three steamships of the Peruvian Navy: \"Pastaza,\" \"Pr\u00f3spero\" y \"Morona\", arrived in the Village of Iquitos.\nThis date is marked as the founding of the first fluvial Peruvian port of Iquitos by the government of Peru. A dockyard and navy factorage imported from England was immediately constructed. In time Iquitos grew so much that it was designated as the capital of the Department of Loreto on 9 November 1897. Iquitos also became the seat of a Roman Catholic &lt;a href=\"Apostolic%20Vicariate\"&gt;Apostolic Vicariate&lt;/a&gt;. Peru was able to map out and assume \"de facto\" control of the majority of the area of the Amazon region under dispute with Ecuador and Colombia. After many skirmishes with Ecuadorian and Colombian outposts, that at times led to war, Peru settled its border with Colombia in 1922 and with Ecuador in 1942.\n20th century: rubber boom.\nBeginning in the 1900s, Iquitos became wealthy through its &lt;a href=\"rubber\"&gt;rubber&lt;/a&gt; industry throughout the &lt;a href=\"rubber%20boom\"&gt;rubber boom&lt;/a&gt;; it attracted thousands of immigrants from around the world, mostly young single men who hoped to make their fortunes in rubber. The rise of the automobile and related industries had dramatically increased the worldwide demand for rubber. Some men became merchants and bankers, and made their fortunes that way. Many of the European men married &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20peoples\"&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt; women and stayed in Peru the rest of their lives, founding ethnically mixed families. The immigrants brought European clothing styles, music, architecture and other cultural elements to Iquitos. They established an opera house that featured European classical music.\nAmong the unique communities formed by the 19th-century immigrants to the rubber boom was one of &lt;a href=\"Sephardic%20Jews\"&gt;Sephardic Jews&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the men married Peruvian women and made families in Iquitos. They established a &lt;a href=\"synagogue\"&gt;synagogue&lt;/a&gt; and the Jewish cemetery. In the first generation, some of the women or children converted to Judaism, but by the end of the 20th century, four or five generations later, most descendants were no longer practicing Jews. Most were reared as Catholic.\nIn the 1990s, a descendant of a Jewish settler undertook serious study of &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt;. He began to revive the practice of Judaism among his family, friends, and other Sephardi descendants. After years of study, with the help of a sympathetic &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Judaism\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rabbi\"&gt;rabbi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lima\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt; and another from &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, eventually a few hundred people studied, practiced as Jews, and converted to Judaism. (Formal conversion was necessary according to \"&lt;a href=\"Halakha\"&gt;Halakha&lt;/a&gt;\" as their mothers were not Jewish.) Many of the converts have emigrated to Israel under its &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%20Return\"&gt;Law of Return&lt;/a&gt;. A documentary was made about this community in 2010. Emigration of Peruvians from this Iquitos community has continued; about 150 emigrated in 2013 to 2014, see \"&lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Jews%20in%20Israel\"&gt;Peruvian Jews in Israel&lt;/a&gt;\" for more.\nThe wealthiest Europeans built great mansions in the late 19th century, some of which survive. \"&lt;a href=\"Casa%20de%20Fierro\"&gt;Casa de Fierro&lt;/a&gt;\" (Spanish for the Iron House) is said to have been designed by &lt;a href=\"Gustave%20Eiffel\"&gt;Gustave Eiffel&lt;/a&gt;, designer of the &lt;a href=\"Eiffel%20Tower\"&gt;Eiffel Tower&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, but evidence supporting this claim is scant. After an Englishman smuggled rubber seeds out of the area to establish competing rubber plantations in British colonies in southeast Asia and Africa, the Peruvian boom came to an end. In addition, a 1913 investigative report by &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Casement\"&gt;Roger Casement&lt;/a&gt;, the British consul-general to Peru who had investigated labor conditions for natives in the &lt;a href=\"Congo%20Free%20State\"&gt;Congo Free State&lt;/a&gt; when it was under &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20II%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;King Leopold&lt;/a&gt;'s control, revealed the abuses of indigenous workers in the Amazon Basin by the &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Amazon%20Company\"&gt;Peruvian Amazon Company&lt;/a&gt; (PAC), owned by businessman &lt;a href=\"Julio%20C%C3%A9sar%20Arana\"&gt;Julio C\u00e9sar Arana&lt;/a&gt;. Its several British board members and numerous stockholders in London were pressured to force changes in operations of the company. Many British divested themselves of this company in an effort to force changes. Arana returned to Peru, where he remained in charge of the PAC. Asian rubber was soon produced at lower cost and undercut that of South America, and rubber declined in importance in Peru.\nBut Iquitos continued as an important trading port in the Amazon basin. It exploited its timber, oil and mineral resources for export and processing, along with agricultural and other products.\n21st century: Amazonian hubbing.\nOn 13 August 2012, a special &lt;a href=\"Commemorative%20plaque\"&gt;plaque&lt;/a&gt; was placed in the plaza 28 de Julio of the city in a ceremony to commemorate the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20River\"&gt;Amazon River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20rainforest\"&gt;rainforest&lt;/a&gt; as one of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Natural%20Wonders%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Seven Natural Wonders of the World&lt;/a&gt;. The plaque was &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;d in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;, Germany. &lt;a href=\"Iguazu%20Falls\"&gt;Iguazu Falls&lt;/a&gt; in Argentina has also been recognized as one of these top natural wonders.\nIn 2021, it was announced that a large (100 MW/100 MWH) solar and storage power facility would be built at Iquitos by 2026, replacing as much as half the diesel burned to produce electricity in the city. \nGeography.\nIquitos is located in northeastern &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, northeastern &lt;a href=\"Loreto%20Region\"&gt;Loreto Region&lt;/a&gt;, and in the extreme south of the &lt;a href=\"Maynas%20Province%2C%20Peru\"&gt;Province of Maynas&lt;/a&gt;. Located on the Great Plains, the city has an area of , comprising the districts &lt;a href=\"Bel%C3%A9n%20District%2C%20Maynas\"&gt;Belen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Punchana%20District\"&gt;Punchana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20Bautista%20District%2C%20Maynas\"&gt;San Juan Bautista&lt;/a&gt;. It is approximately at coordinates 03 \u00b0 43'46 \"S 73 \u00b0 14'18\" W to . It is the most northern Peruvian city.\nIt is surrounded by the Port of Iquitos, formed by the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20River\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nanay%20River\"&gt;Nanay&lt;/a&gt; and Itaya rivers. The city is situated on the left bank of the Amazon River, which provides a characteristic economic life, including &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; and transport. The Itaya and Nanay rivers limit the physical expansion of the city in that direction; new development is growing toward the south and there is a slight population density in Downtown Iquitos. Close to Iquitos are a number of lagoons and lakes; Moronococha Lake is a boundary to the city on the west. These features make the city seem like a huge, faux &lt;a href=\"river%20island\"&gt;river island&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeologically, the city is settled in a &lt;a href=\"Tertiary\"&gt;Tertiary&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Quaternary\"&gt;Quaternary&lt;/a&gt; formation &lt;a href=\"lithologically\"&gt;lithologically&lt;/a&gt; composed by little-consolidated &lt;a href=\"lutite\"&gt;lutite&lt;/a&gt;s, with remains of flora or fauna, and numerous &lt;a href=\"white%20sand\"&gt;white-sand&lt;/a&gt; lenses of abundant &lt;a href=\"silicon\"&gt;silicon&lt;/a&gt;. The residual soils are sandy, almost clay-like and variably deep. &lt;a href=\"Physiography\"&gt;Physiography&lt;/a&gt;, is a &lt;a href=\"hazy\"&gt;hazy&lt;/a&gt; landscape due to the undulations of the &lt;a href=\"soil%20erosion\"&gt;soil erosion&lt;/a&gt; caused by rain.\nClimate.\nIquitos experiences an equatorial climate that is a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20rainforest%20climate\"&gt;tropical rainforest climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Af\") under the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt;, more subject to the &lt;a href=\"Intertropical%20Convergence%20Zone\"&gt;Intertropical Convergence Zone&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href=\"trade%20wind\"&gt;trade wind&lt;/a&gt;s and with no &lt;a href=\"cyclone\"&gt;cyclone&lt;/a&gt;s. There is constant &lt;a href=\"rainfall\"&gt;rainfall&lt;/a&gt; throughout the year, without a distinct &lt;a href=\"dry%20season\"&gt;dry season&lt;/a&gt;, but a wetter summer. Because the seasons are not sensitive in the equatorial zone, Iquitos has only two seasons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"rainy\"&gt;rainy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wet%20season\"&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; arrives in November and ends in May. March and April have the heaviest rains and humidity, with precipitation between , respectively. In May, the Amazon River, one of the rivers surrounding the city, reaches its highest levels. It falls around at its lowest point in October, and then steadily rises again cyclically according to rainfall.\n&lt;a href=\"Winter\"&gt;Winter&lt;/a&gt; offers a drier, sunnier climate. Although July and August are the driest months, they have some periods of &lt;a href=\"Rain\"&gt;downpours&lt;/a&gt;. Sunny days and good weather are common. Rainfall is more abundant here than in &lt;a href=\"Ayacucho\"&gt;Ayacucho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cusco\"&gt;Cusco&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Lima\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt;.\nIquitos also has &lt;a href=\"microclimate\"&gt;microclimate&lt;/a&gt;s: rain or &lt;a href=\"drizzle\"&gt;drizzle&lt;/a&gt; may be present in some areas of the districts, while other parts of the city are slightly cloudy or clear. The temperature may vary. The &lt;a href=\"urban%20climate\"&gt;urban climate&lt;/a&gt; is slightly warmer than the natural climate, and would be reflected by the thermal sensation. It suffers from a phenomenon called &lt;a href=\"urban%20heat%20island\"&gt;urban heat island&lt;/a&gt;, when the city's heat has difficulty dissipating during the night hours due to absorption by buildings and pavement.\nNatural hazards.\nThe main natural hazard is &lt;a href=\"flooding\"&gt;flooding&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012, &lt;a href=\"2012%20Loreto%20floods\"&gt;major flooding occurred in Iquitos&lt;/a&gt; who alerted the population and affected coastal areas and several towns in the metropolitan area, which has a floodable, rainy geography. The floods of 2012 were regarded as the most historic natural disaster to Iquitos to date. Wet weather in Loreto took showers and drizzle, causing damage and flooding in the Loreto Region since November 2011. The rainy weather continued until early 2012, and increased the level of water in the Amazon river\u2014wide stream that feeds most of the tributaries in Loreto \u2014 up to . Since February and March, several villages are affected (19,209 and 18,400 families affected), 26 000 hectares of farmland are flooded and the water level reached coastal streets of Iquitos. On 24 April 2012, the spate faded, and initiated the first stage of &lt;a href=\"Tide\"&gt;ebb&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther natural hazards are &lt;a href=\"heat%20wave\"&gt;heat wave&lt;/a&gt;s where temperatures can reach over with a &lt;a href=\"heat%20index\"&gt;heat index&lt;/a&gt; of which is caused by the low humidity on clear days. &lt;a href=\"Cold%20wave\"&gt;Cold wave&lt;/a&gt;s are also curious in Iquitos: cold air from the tip of the continent driven by the dynamics of the atmosphere, comes to town and causes a drop in temperature, moderate rainfall and thunderstorms. The trade winds also come to cause gales reaching . In October 2012, Iquitos experienced high temperatures and heavy thunderstorms.\nEarthquakes in the city are very rare and very deep. Iquitos is located in Region 3 of Systematic Regionalization Map of Peru, which means that the city has a low coefficient &lt;a href=\"seismic%20value\"&gt;seismic value&lt;/a&gt;, although the 2011 Peru earthquake, which occurred southeast of &lt;a href=\"Contamana\"&gt;Contamana&lt;/a&gt;, was felt in the city as a small and unexpected jolt.\nEcology.\nDue to its location in the Peruvian Amazon, Iquitos has a green landscape with a vast variety of life. The flora is varied with great presence of 850 species, including 22 species of palms and orchids, who provide the attractive forest within the urban landscape of the city. The lilies also present. The extensive forests seated within metropolitan influence host fauna with 130 species of mammals, 330 of birds, 150 of reptiles and amphibians, and 250 fish. Within the city, inhabiting the &lt;a href=\"rock%20dove\"&gt;rock dove&lt;/a&gt; (\"Columba livia\"), especially in the Square 28 de Julio. Also recorded the transient presence of &lt;a href=\"bull%20shark\"&gt;bull shark&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Carcharhinus leucas\") who come from the Atlantic Ocean, traveling 3,360 miles to Iquitos.\nThe floodplain forest of Iquitos is the peculiar ecoregion which surrounds the city, and is characterized by a &lt;a href=\"v%C3%A1rzea%20forest\"&gt;v\u00e1rzea forest&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Iquitos%20varzea\"&gt;Iquitos varzea&lt;/a&gt;. Its alluvial detail is the motive why intense rainy seasons easily reach these areas flood. In the natural cycle, the trees drop their leaves and other organic waste to the soil, and become &lt;a href=\"humus\"&gt;humus&lt;/a&gt;. Rain washes these nutrients into rivers, which gives that blonde color, called &lt;a href=\"tannin\"&gt;tannin&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately, this cycle repeats.\nThe great biodiversity that the Iquitos Metropolitan Area houses and protects is paramount, and that is intrinsically related to its urban planning, which puts a limit action in areas where farms should not be built. Because of this, the appearance of &lt;a href=\"informal%20settlements\"&gt;informal settlements&lt;/a&gt; is seen as a risk.\nNatural reserves and zoos.\nThe importance of the existence of nature reserves is a priority in Iquitos for ecosystem protection.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Allpahuayo-Mishana%20National%20Reserve\"&gt;Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve&lt;/a&gt; is a protected area with soaring rates of biodiversity. The reserve is located from Iquitos, being reached by Route LO-103. The ecosystem is part of the &lt;a href=\"Nanay%20River\"&gt;Nanay River&lt;/a&gt; basin, specifically in an area called \"Ecoregion Napo\", which contains a unique Amazonian biodiversity, including its distinctive white sand forests. The Napo Ecoregion contains 112 species of &lt;a href=\"amphibian\"&gt;amphibian&lt;/a&gt;s, 17 species of &lt;a href=\"primate\"&gt;primate&lt;/a&gt;s, 1900 plant species and over 600 birds species. Some ecologically important animals care for their rarity in the reserve are the supay pichico (\"&lt;a href=\"Callimico%20goeldii\"&gt;Callimico goeldii&lt;/a&gt;\"), black stump (\"&lt;a href=\"Callicebus%20torquatus\"&gt;Callicebus torquatus&lt;/a&gt;\"), equatorial saki (\"&lt;a href=\"Pithecia%20aequatorialis\"&gt;Pithecia aequatorialis&lt;/a&gt;\") ancient antwren (\"&lt;a href=\"Herpsilochmus%20gentryi\"&gt;Herpsilochmus gentryi&lt;/a&gt;\"), Mishana tyrannulet (\"&lt;a href=\"Zimmerius%20villarejoi\"&gt;Zimmerius villarejoi&lt;/a&gt;\"), Allpahuayo antbird (\"&lt;a href=\"Percnostola%20arenarum\"&gt;Percnostola arenarum&lt;/a&gt;\"), chestnut-tailed ant (\"Myrmeciza centuculorum castanea\"), the pompadour cotinga (\"&lt;a href=\"Xipholena%20punicea\"&gt;Xipholena punicea&lt;/a&gt;\"), saffron-crested tyrant-manakin (\"&lt;a href=\"Neopelma%20chrysocephalum\"&gt;Neopelma chrysocephalum&lt;/a&gt;\"), among others. The Iquitos gnatcatcher (&lt;a href=\"Polioptila%20clementsi\"&gt;Polioptila clementsi&lt;/a&gt;) is an endemic species of the reserve and is considered a symbol of Iquitos.\n&lt;a href=\"Quistococha%20Tourist%20Complex\"&gt;Quistococha Tourist Complex&lt;/a&gt; is characterized by its variety. The place is located from Iquitos via Route AS-103, and with an extension of natural forest, has a small zoo, a &lt;a href=\"serpentarium\"&gt;serpentarium&lt;/a&gt;, an aquarium, a nursery and an artificial beach called Tunchi Beach.\nThe &lt;a href=\"butterfly%20zoo\"&gt;butterfly zoo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pilpintuwasi\"&gt;Pilpintuwasi&lt;/a&gt; is located in Padre Cocha, Iquitos, and includes more than 40 species of insects, especially butterflies. Along the butterfly zoo, is the Amazon Animal Orphanage, commissioned in &lt;a href=\"animal%20rescue%20group\"&gt;animal rescue&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemography.\nIn 1808, Hipolito Sanchez Rangel, the &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; of Maynas, reported that the village of Iquitos had 171 inhabitants and on 8 June 1842, the date when the town was elevated to a district, it had just over 200 inhabitants.\nIn 1860, according to Paz Soldan, the town had only 300 inhabitants. Two years later, the population increased to about 431 inhabitants and in 1864, there were 648 people, predominantly mestizo due to the presence of families from Borja, Santiago, Santa Teresa, Barranca and others, who fled away from the attack on the Huambisas and Aguaruna native and destroyed the villages.\nAccording to Genaro Herrera, in 1866, Iquitos had a population of 648 people. For 1876, again the same author reports a population of 1,475 inhabitants.\nIn 1903, in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"rubber%20boom\"&gt;rubber boom&lt;/a&gt;, Iquitos had 9,438 inhabitants (census of Benito Lords), of which 542 were foreigners, most of them from Spain (95) Brazil (80), China (74), Portugal (64) and as many from Italy, England, France, Ecuador, United States, Russia, Switzerland and Morocco.\nCurrently, Iquitos has emerged as the largest city in the Peruvian Amazon. Counted by the Census of 2007 with 406,340 inhabitants.\nGovernment.\nIquitos is a &lt;a href=\"Provincial%20municipality%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;provincial municipality&lt;/a&gt; with a system of government headed by a &lt;a href=\"Provincial%20Council%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;Provincial Council&lt;/a&gt;, composed of the Mayor and fifteen &lt;a href=\"aldermen\"&gt;aldermen&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Provincial%20Municipality%20of%20Maynas\"&gt;Provincial Municipality of Maynas&lt;/a&gt; (MPM) is the main body that has jurisdiction in the &lt;a href=\"Maynas%20Province%2C%20Peru\"&gt;Maynas Province&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iquitos%20District\"&gt;Iquitos District&lt;/a&gt;, and authorities are elected by &lt;a href=\"Direct%20election\"&gt;popular vote&lt;/a&gt;. The municipal government is responsible to plan development and territorial order within its jurisdiction, promote strategic coordinate on district order. It is responsible for &lt;a href=\"public%20education\"&gt;public education&lt;/a&gt;, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, urban planning, regulation of all types of transportation, municipal tax collection, maintenance of public roads (asphalt, cleaning, etc..) and gardens, promoting culture and preservation of architecture and public places, among others. The Municipal Manager is responsible \"to direct, coordinate, monitor and evaluate the technical, financial and administrative of the Municipality\".\nThe MPM has support bodies formed by the General Secretariat, the Office of Institutional Image, Administrative Management, Revenue Management and the General Office of Information. The line agencies are &lt;a href=\"bureaucratic\"&gt;bureaucratic&lt;/a&gt; managers with a distinct role and have the function of carrying out the institution's mission, which includes the &lt;a href=\"Urban%20planning\"&gt;Territorial Conditioning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sanitation\"&gt;Sanitation and Environmental Health&lt;/a&gt;, Works and Infrastructure, &lt;a href=\"Public%20transport\"&gt;Traffic and Public Transport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Social%20Development\"&gt;Social Development&lt;/a&gt;, Economic Development and Municipal Services. The MPM organizes the Municipal Ombudsman Service of Child and Adolescent.\nThe mayor was Adela Jimenez, an architect, chosen by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Jury%20of%20Elections\"&gt;National Jury of Elections&lt;/a&gt; to fill temporarily to Charles Zevallos who was suspended for health reasons. Jimenez was the first woman to hold the office of mayor provincial and Iquitos. Current mayor is Francisco Sanjurjo D\u00e1vila.\nThe political geography of Iquitos is comprised four districts or &lt;a href=\"commune\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt;s, each with a district municipality. Except &lt;a href=\"Iquitos%20District\"&gt;Iquitos District&lt;/a&gt; does not have a district municipality as such, the Provincial Municipality of Maynas also functions as his council district. The other districts are with a respective one: District Municipality of Punchna, the District Municipality of San Juan Bautista and the District Municipality of Bel\u00e9n. Each municipality has interference in his own district, and each has a policy of &lt;a href=\"urban%20planning\"&gt;urban planning&lt;/a&gt; that is created according to the state of his district.\nEnvironmental issues.\nThe environmental management of the city has faced the accumulation of &lt;a href=\"garbage\"&gt;garbage&lt;/a&gt; in various parts of the city and along more informal piers, and creating a remarkable &lt;a href=\"visual%20pollution\"&gt;visual&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"soil%20pollution\"&gt;soil pollution&lt;/a&gt;. The result is a serious blow to &lt;a href=\"environmental%20ethics\"&gt;environmental ethics&lt;/a&gt;, being the providing a profile of &lt;a href=\"sustainable%20city\"&gt;sustainable city&lt;/a&gt;. The problem usually occurs in the informal settlements and markets such as Bel\u00e9n. In the central areas, some people &lt;a href=\"Litter\"&gt;throw away trash on the ground without apparent concern&lt;/a&gt; although there is a law against it. In other minor cases, seem to ignore the cubes, being close to them, throw away the trash on the ground anyway. In markets, the presence of &lt;a href=\"illegal%20dumping\"&gt;illegal dumping&lt;/a&gt; is another problem. Styrofoam containers are the vessel of choice for any food service, and the practice of carrying out or getting meals delivered, especially at lunchtime, is ubiquitous.\nThe government and several environmental organizations in Iquitos began spreading environmental education of citizens, and the results obtained were of slight beneficial impact gradually. However, the garbage (usually piled in mounds) still appears in various parts of the city, due to the lack of environmental awareness in the majority of citizens. In 2013 the city attempted to launch a recycling program for plastics but did not get beyond the initial test stage. Most waste is brought to an uncovered dumping area next to the Iquitos-Nauta highway. Plastics and other toxic and non-biodegradeable products are still thrown in the river.\n&lt;a href=\"Noise%20pollution\"&gt;Noise pollution&lt;/a&gt; caused by their bustling public transport also seriously affects the city, and has always been tolerated ignoring alarms despite charging high intensity in recent years. The frenetic urban noise up to 115 decibels exceeds the desirable level (70\u00a0dB) indicated by the &lt;a href=\"World%20Health%20Organization\"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and, therefore, makes Iquitos in the noisiest city in Latin America.\nOn the hydrological, Iquitos encourages the protection of &lt;a href=\"Nanay%20River\"&gt;Nanay River&lt;/a&gt; basin because it is major, natural &lt;a href=\"Water%20supply%20network\"&gt;drinking water supply&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Illegal%20logging\"&gt;Illegal logging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"illegal%20hunting\"&gt;illegal hunting&lt;/a&gt; and trading of rare and &lt;a href=\"endangered%20species\"&gt;endangered species&lt;/a&gt; are also major environmental issues in Iquitos. This area has long been plagued by abuses to the few existing environmental protection laws, as well as a deeply entrenched wood laundering system so that illegal wood appears to be legal upon sale to international corporations. Local markets actively trade in rare and endangered species, much to satisfy tourist and foreign demand. In both of these arenas, the locals who work the hardest sourcing these products from the forest get the least compensation, if any at all.\nMetropolitan area.\nThe city is the urban core of Iquitos Metropolitan Area. It is a conurbation consists of four districts that are heavily populated in the city, while rural areas become more so away from the downtown. The Iquitos District is the urban origin of the city and the metropolitan area. Moronacocha, which has 85,000 inhabitants, could become the fifth district of Iquitos.\nIquitos is composed of four districts.\nThe metropolitan area of Iquitos is also organized by another system subdivisions, less known by the local colloquialism.\nEconomy.\nIquitos is the main center of commerce, tourism and industry in the Amazon rainforest with the world. As gateway to the Peruvian Amazon, the economy of many parts of the region come to Iquitos for sustainable control. The Economic Development Management of the Provincial Municipality of Maynas is responsible for regulating and regulate trade, business development and employment, tourism and rural production both Iquitos District as whole Maynas Province. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Commerce\"&gt;Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; of Iquitos is headed by economist Victor Manuel Valdivia Barberis.\nThe city is a major center for &lt;a href=\"finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt;, sales, transportation, tourism, media, while major industries that work is the &lt;a href=\"timber%20industry\"&gt;timber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"petroleum%20industry\"&gt;petroleum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Natural%20gas\"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flour%20milling\"&gt;flour milling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rum\"&gt;rum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"camu%20camu\"&gt;camu camu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bakery\"&gt;bakery&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"fishing%20industry\"&gt;fishing industry&lt;/a&gt; is another big support for the economy of the city. The Belen Market has a frenetic commercial activity that is part of its economy. Iquitos has great financial backing has been able to help it progress now since its role in the &lt;a href=\"rubber%20boom\"&gt;rubber boom&lt;/a&gt;, although must be overcome with effort after the &lt;a href=\"rubber\"&gt;rubber&lt;/a&gt; was no longer produced in the city. The petroleum industry, despite being outside the urban area of Iquitos, has greatly influenced its evolution. In addition, trade has mainly helped the growth of the city. In San Juan Bautista, economic development is based on agriculture (&lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"peach%20palm\"&gt;pijuayo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"star%20apple\"&gt;caimito&lt;/a&gt;), fish, &lt;a href=\"poultry\"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bubaline\"&gt;bubaline&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;. The petroleum, one of the most precious resources, extracted mainly from the region northwest of Loreto and part of it is transported to the &lt;a href=\"Oil%20refinery\"&gt;refinery&lt;/a&gt; in Iquitos. The timber transport is another important economic factor, however, due to the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Trade%20Agreement\"&gt;Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; between Peru and the United States, the gross exploitation of timber has decreased considerably.\nAccording to Rolando Arellano, president of Arellano Marketing, describes the \"Iquite\u00f1o\" consumer to have greater preference for a \"&lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;Western model&lt;/a&gt; with a more modern orientation than the Peruvian-Andean lifestyle\".\nWith projects of large &lt;a href=\"Shopping%20mall\"&gt;mall&lt;/a&gt;s, the city still has a trade-in retail stores and minimarkets throughout the metropolitan area, more strongly in main avenues such as Prospero, Arica, Grau and Alfonso Ugarte located in the center of Iquitos and the Bel\u00e9n District. &lt;a href=\"Retail\"&gt;Retail distribution&lt;/a&gt; of imported products has created regional and social stratification that goes from the merchant importer to urban &lt;a href=\"retailer\"&gt;retailer&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as a strong link between the urban and rural economy.\nCompanies located in Iquitos include Amaz\u00f3nica, &lt;a href=\"Backus\"&gt;Backus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"BBVA%20Continental\"&gt;Banco Continental&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banco%20de%20Cr%C3%A9dito%20del%20Per%C3%BA\"&gt;Banco de Cr\u00e9dito del Per\u00fa&lt;/a&gt;, Banco de la Naci\u00f3n, Banco Financiero, &lt;a href=\"Bata%20Shoes\"&gt;Bata Shoes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claro%20Americas\"&gt;Claro Americas&lt;/a&gt;, CrediVargas, &lt;a href=\"DHL%20Express\"&gt;DHL Express&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"DirecTV\"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt;, Electro Oriente, Galer\u00edas Quispe, Supermercado Pacific, &lt;a href=\"Honda\"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;, Husqvarna AB, Inkafarma, &lt;a href=\"Interbank\"&gt;Interbank&lt;/a&gt;, Los Portales, &lt;a href=\"Mapfre\"&gt;Mapfre&lt;/a&gt;, Motocorp, Multicines Star, Orvisa/&lt;a href=\"Caterpillar%20Inc.\"&gt;Caterpillar&lt;/a&gt;, Persa, &lt;a href=\"Petroper%C3%BA\"&gt;Petroper\u00fa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RadioShack\"&gt;RadioShack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotiabank\"&gt;Scotiabank&lt;/a&gt;, Shambo, &lt;a href=\"Special%20Book%20Services\"&gt;Special Book Services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Telef%C3%B3nica\"&gt;Telef\u00f3nica&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Movistar\"&gt;Movistar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Coca-Cola%20Company\"&gt;The Coca-Cola Company&lt;/a&gt;, Topitop, &lt;a href=\"Western%20Union\"&gt;Western Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yamaha%20Corporation\"&gt;Yamaha Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, among others.\nIn the coming years, companies like &lt;a href=\"Ripley%20S.A.\"&gt;Ripley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saga%20Falabella\"&gt;Saga Falabella&lt;/a&gt;, Metro, &lt;a href=\"Plaza%20Vea\"&gt;Plaza Vea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tottus\"&gt;Tottus&lt;/a&gt;, among others, will be available.\nEducation.\nIquitos is home to numerous research projects on ecology related to &lt;a href=\"ornithology\"&gt;ornithology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"herpetology\"&gt;herpetology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cornell%20University\"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt; owns a field station dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Cornell%20University%20Esbaran%20Amazon%20Field%20Laboratory\"&gt;Cornell University Esbaran Amazon Field Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in July 2001 under the direction of Dr. &lt;a href=\"Eloy%20Rodriguez\"&gt;Eloy Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt;, the facility is dedicated to education, &lt;a href=\"conservation%20biology\"&gt;conservation&lt;/a&gt;, and the discovery of novel medicinal compounds from applied field &lt;a href=\"chemoecology\"&gt;chemoecology&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe field lab strives to survey and catalog the biological diversity found along the &lt;a href=\"Yarapa%20River\"&gt;Yarapa River&lt;/a&gt; Basin. It provides researchers with field experience in the broad range of disciplines necessary for this task. Another major goal is to explore value-added derivatives of biodiversity. This includes both tangible returns, in the form of new discoveries in the biomedical and related sciences, as well as less tangible goods, such as the promotion of &lt;a href=\"ecotourism\"&gt;ecotourism&lt;/a&gt; and an ecological ethic. They work to ensure benefits to the local communities, and to participating students and researchers.\nUniversities.\nIquitos has four universities: Universidad Nacional de la Amazon\u00eda Peruana (UNAP), the local state university; Universidad Particular de Iquitos (UPI), Universidad Cient\u00edfica del Per\u00fa (UCP), Universidad Peruana del Oriente (UPO) three private institutions. It is also home to the \"Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazon\u00eda Peruana\" (IIAP), the Institute of Investigation of the Peruvian Amazon.\nTransport.\nIquitos has a personality very different from the rest of Peru and even different from other South-American Amazonian cities. The streets of Iquitos are dominated by more than 25,000 &lt;a href=\"auto%20rickshaws\"&gt;auto rickshaws&lt;/a&gt; or motokars, known in the rest of Peru under the name of mototaxi, and for foreigners as auto rickshaw or tuk-tuk, providing taxi service. The buses are large vehicles made of wood with direct routes.\nIquitos is widely regarded as the largest inland city that is inaccessible by road. The air and river transport are the main means for entry or exit of people and goods to the city, since the cost of living in this city and people of the region is generally higher than the Peruvian standard. It is considered that Iquitos is the second most expensive city in Peru after &lt;a href=\"Cusco\"&gt;Cusco&lt;/a&gt;. A proposed road link to &lt;a href=\"Sarameriza%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;Sarameriza&lt;/a&gt;, to be completed by 2021, would connect Iquitos to the country's road network.\nThe city has renewed &lt;a href=\"Crnl.%20FAP%20Francisco%20Secada%20Vignetta%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Crnl. FAP Francisco Secada Vignetta International Airport&lt;/a&gt; where domestic and international flights operate. In the domestic terminal there are routes from &lt;a href=\"Lima\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Peruvian provinces&lt;/a&gt;. While in the international terminal there are flights from/to &lt;a href=\"Panama%20City\"&gt;Panama City&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesdays and Saturdays with &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Airlines\"&gt;Copa Airlines&lt;/a&gt; also connecting from/to USA, Mexico, Canada, Central America &amp; Caribbean, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Brazil. There are between 8 to 9 daily flights to Iquitos from Lima, some make intermediate stops in &lt;a href=\"Pucallpa\"&gt;Pucallpa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tarapoto\"&gt;Tarapoto&lt;/a&gt;. Air routes are served by four companies: &lt;a href=\"LAN%20Per%C3%BA\"&gt;LAN Per\u00fa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Airlines\"&gt;Peruvian Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Star%20Per%C3%BA\"&gt;Star Per\u00fa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Airlines\"&gt;Copa Airlines&lt;/a&gt;. The direct flight between Lima and Iquitos takes 1 hour and 45 minutes. Copa Airlines provides international flights to the city with Panama and the Americas from 14 July 2012. Since June 2011, the Central Government of Peru provided two &lt;a href=\"de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-6%20Twin%20Otter\"&gt;de Havilland Canada DHC-6 \"Twin Otter\"&lt;/a&gt; for operations across the region.\nCityscape.\nArchitecture.\nIquitos has architecturally significant buildings in a particular range of structural remnants were built during the &lt;a href=\"rubber%20boom\"&gt;rubber boom&lt;/a&gt; of the 1880s. Comprise mainly &lt;a href=\"Architecture%20of%20Europe\"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt;/Amazonian-style buildings with &lt;a href=\"ceramic%20tile\"&gt;ceramic tile&lt;/a&gt;s imported from Italy and Portugal, and its unique, French architecture called &lt;a href=\"Casa%20de%20Fierro\"&gt;Casa de Fierro&lt;/a&gt; built by &lt;a href=\"Gustave%20Eiffel\"&gt;Gustave Eiffel&lt;/a&gt;, who built the original house in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; for an exhibition of 1878. However, the structure is not the only European urban appeal: the city is also characterized by the rustic architecture or conventional as the &lt;a href=\"Stilt%20house\"&gt;palafitte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"maloca\"&gt;maloca&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Hut%20%28dwelling%29\"&gt;hut&lt;/a&gt;s that are located primarily in the areas of the city.\nHistorically, the first native inhabitants of the settlements built their houses of sticks and leaves and other natural resources, which were tailored to protect the &lt;a href=\"climate\"&gt;climate&lt;/a&gt;, wildlife and other hazards. The styles of housing in those settlements up the huts and cocameras, used as a large communal houses. Other peculiar conventional architectures are characterized by firmness and isothermal conditions; they are categorized into three types of home: &lt;a href=\"quincha\"&gt;quincha&lt;/a&gt; \u2014built with posts and &lt;a href=\"Arundo%20donax\"&gt;giant cane&lt;/a&gt;\u2014, &lt;a href=\"rammed%20earth\"&gt;rammed earth&lt;/a&gt; \u2014resistant and isothermal\u2014, and &lt;a href=\"adobe\"&gt;adobe&lt;/a&gt; \u2014irm with the same isothermal condition.\nThe &lt;a href=\"rubber%20boom\"&gt;rubber boom&lt;/a&gt; of the 1880s caused a severe change in the architectural face of Iquitos. Foreign and &lt;a href=\"rubber%20baron\"&gt;rubber baron&lt;/a&gt;s brought with them the influence of countries like Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, and descendants as &lt;a href=\"Sephardim\"&gt;Sephardim&lt;/a&gt;. Jose de Jesus Reategui and a young group built the main features of the urban city in the years of boom, including the Iglesia Matriz de Iquitos. In the Iquitos popular belief of the 19th century, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; was considered less humane and aesthetic, but &lt;a href=\"Gustave%20Eiffel\"&gt;Gustave Eiffel&lt;/a&gt; got the &lt;a href=\"Casa%20de%20Fierro\"&gt;Casa de Fierro&lt;/a&gt; became an attraction in the city, although historically the prefabricated building was not designed to Iquitos. &lt;a href=\"Baroque\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rococo\"&gt;Rococo&lt;/a&gt; style also influenced the architecture of Iquitos, and defense against the rain was another prominent feature given for buildings. About 90 buildings are declared architectural heritage of Loreto.\nCulture and contemporary life.\nIquitos has vibrant, unique, complex and diverse &lt;a href=\"culture\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt;, and is regarded as cultural hub that meeting the Peruvian Amazon, according to &lt;a href=\"Lonely%20Planet\"&gt;Lonely Planet&lt;/a&gt;. Many natives visit the city to present their dances or sell their &lt;a href=\"craft\"&gt;craft&lt;/a&gt;s. It also brings a wealth of customs and traditions remained considerably over the years and in the Iquitos calendar, between her festivities, &lt;a href=\"cuisine\"&gt;cuisine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20accent\"&gt;Spanish accent&lt;/a&gt; and mythology. Currently, its culture is undergoing an impetuous transition to a contemporary level to preserve their traditions with innovative art movements.\nOne of the main factors of the traditional cultural energy of Iquitos is Amazonian mythology, which has a range of characters, identified by folklore in imaginary beings. Many of the legendary beings, with appearances motivated by local geography, have powers and influenced much in &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"worldview\"&gt;worldview&lt;/a&gt; of Iquitos. The dance and music, a mix of &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20peoples\"&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mestizo\"&gt;mestizo&lt;/a&gt; heritage are closely related to the meanings of mythology, and also with the life of the citizen and Amazonian villager.\nThe complex cultural life of Iquitos consists mainly of native iquite\u00f1os, &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20people\"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20people\"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt;s, Chineses and settled &lt;a href=\"expatriate\"&gt;expatriate&lt;/a&gt;s ethnicities. The term \"charapa culture\" generally refers to social, cultural and artistic movements of Iquitos.\nIquitos has a unique culture that is strongly felt, as the following quotes says:\nContemporary cultural movements began in the city, such as the &lt;a href=\"Amazonian%20pop%20art\"&gt;Amazonian pop art&lt;/a&gt; and Amazonian graffiti\u2014with Pukuna 8990 being the most revolutionary graffiti movement\u2014Iquite\u00f1o music subgenres of &lt;a href=\"electronica%20music\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hip%20hop\"&gt;hip hop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rap\"&gt;rap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"French%20jazz\"&gt;French jazz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Punk%20rock\"&gt;punk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"psytrance\"&gt;psytrance&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"full-on\"&gt;full-on&lt;/a&gt;, next to traditional Amazonian music. The Children's and Youthful Symphonic Orchestra of Iquitos is the main symphonic group in the city.\nIquitos has been &lt;a href=\"Benchmarking\"&gt;benchmark&lt;/a&gt;ed over the years in &lt;a href=\"literature\"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"film\"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;. The Peruvian writer &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Vargas%20Llosa\"&gt;Mario Vargas Llosa&lt;/a&gt; wrote his work \"&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Pantoja%20and%20the%20Special%20Service\"&gt;Captain Pantoja and the Special Service&lt;/a&gt;\" inspired by the city. &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Lombardi\"&gt;Francisco Lombardi&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Pantoja%20and%20the%20Special%20Services%20%282000%20film%29\"&gt;2000 film&lt;/a&gt;, based on the novel by Vargas Llosa was filmed in this city. In &lt;a href=\"R%C3%B3mulo%20Gallegos%20Prize\"&gt;R\u00f3mulo Gallegos-winning&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20House\"&gt;The Green House&lt;/a&gt;\" (1965) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dream%20of%20the%20Celt\"&gt;The Dream of the Celt&lt;/a&gt;\" (2010), other novels of Mario Vargas Llosa, also part of the plot occurs in Iquitos.\nEntertainment and arts.\nIquitos has an intense tourist movement in the &lt;a href=\"entertainment\"&gt;entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on specific points located throughout the city. With a growing organization of entertainment today, the city has always had groups concerned to project the Iquitos &lt;a href=\"The%20arts\"&gt;arts&lt;/a&gt; such as dance, music, film, painting, literature and theater.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"visual%20arts\"&gt;visual arts&lt;/a&gt;, the city is the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"Amazonian%20pop%20art\"&gt;Amazonian pop art&lt;/a&gt; (also known wild &lt;a href=\"naive\"&gt;naive&lt;/a&gt;) which is a unique, &lt;a href=\"self-taught\"&gt;self-taught&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pop-art\"&gt;pop-art&lt;/a&gt; style of the city, and is notable for its \"sparkling\" &lt;a href=\"chromaticism\"&gt;chromaticism&lt;/a&gt;, and makes a reference to &lt;a href=\"hallucinogenic\"&gt;hallucinogenic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ayahuasca\"&gt;ayahuasca&lt;/a&gt; experiences. Originally, it is a &lt;a href=\"mural\"&gt;mural art&lt;/a&gt; that blends prominently the colorful amazonian culture, European motifs and commercial characters, which may be influenced by American &lt;a href=\"pop%20art\"&gt;pop art&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href=\"MTV\"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn several works of painters \"iquite\u00f1os\" (such as Christian Bendayan, Rold\u00e1n Pinedo, Elena Valera, Rember Yahuarcani, Brus Rubio and Victor Churay), Amazonian pop art legacy has been a visual reference to create avant-garde works of contemporary life in the city and Amazonian culture.\nThe Direcci\u00f3n Regional de Cultura (formerly known as Instituto Nacional de Cultura del Per\u00fa), with headquarters in the city, mainly funded events and arts festivals in the city, although there are also small &lt;a href=\"indie%20art\"&gt;indie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Subculture\"&gt;underground&lt;/a&gt; groups that conduct their own cultural events. The city has many small festivals; the highlights are &lt;a href=\"Estamos%20en%20la%20Calle\"&gt;Estamos en la Calle&lt;/a&gt;, Iquitos Outfest, and other small annual events.\nThe city is known for having a remarkable celebration, called simply \"Carnaval\". During this festival, mainly pagan, celebrants are dedicated to wetting people with \"&lt;a href=\"Water%20balloon\"&gt;cabaci\u00f1as&lt;/a&gt;\" or other instrument. Many choose to be more extravagant, wetting with various substances such as paint or other object as cause for celebration. The celebration is unique each year in February. The carnival is heavily influenced by myths and rich Amazonian culture. It also celebrates the Day of San Juan, referring to &lt;a href=\"John%20the%20Baptist\"&gt;John the Baptist&lt;/a&gt; as patron saint in the Peruvian Amazon, whose feast is celebrated on 24 June. The main element is the juane and other own dances as shunto jump.\nCinema.\nIquitos has a major &lt;a href=\"Filmmaking\"&gt;cinematic&lt;/a&gt; history, which originated from the arrival of foreign families during the &lt;a href=\"rubber%20boom\"&gt;rubber boom&lt;/a&gt; in the early 20th century. A group of people brought &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, including projectors of the &lt;a href=\"Lumiere%20Brothers\"&gt;Lumiere brothers&lt;/a&gt;. The most important pioneer of cinema in Iquitos and the Loreto Region is &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Wong%20Rengifo\"&gt;Antonio Wong Rengifo&lt;/a&gt;; alongside this, other filmmakers such as &lt;a href=\"Werner%20Herzog\"&gt;Werner Herzog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Robles%20Godoy\"&gt;Armando Robles Godoy&lt;/a&gt;, Nora Izcue, Federico Garc\u00eda, and Dorian Fern\u00e1ndez-Moris prolonged the cinematic presence in the city. Iquitos was and is used as a &lt;a href=\"Scene%20%28film%29\"&gt;cultural scene&lt;/a&gt;, reference, and shelter for many filmmakers.\n&lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20Iquitos%23List%20of%20films\"&gt;Major films filmed in Iquitos&lt;/a&gt; and its surroundings are: \"Frente del Putumayo\" (1932) and \"Bajo el sol de Loreto\" (1936) by &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Wong%20Rengifo\"&gt;Antonio Wong Rengifo&lt;/a&gt;; \"&lt;a href=\"No%20Stars%20in%20the%20Jungle\"&gt;No Stars in the Jungle&lt;/a&gt;\" (1966) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Wall\"&gt;The Green Wall&lt;/a&gt;\" (1969) by &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Robles%20Godoy\"&gt;Armando Robles Godoy&lt;/a&gt;; \"&lt;a href=\"Aguirre%2C%20the%20Wrath%20of%20God\"&gt;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&lt;/a&gt;\" (1972) and \"&lt;a href=\"Fitzcarraldo\"&gt;Fitzcarraldo&lt;/a&gt;\" (1982) by Werner Herzog; \"Informe sobre los shipibos\" (1974), \"Los hombres del Ucayali\" and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Pantoja%20and%20the%20Special%20Services%20%282000%20film%29\"&gt;Captain Pantoja and the Special Services&lt;/a&gt; (2000) by &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Lombardi\"&gt;Francisco Lombardi&lt;/a&gt;, and \"&lt;a href=\"General%20Cemetery\"&gt;General Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;\" (2012) by Dori\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez-Moris.\nDespite having a long filmography, the film industry promoted the city is not too hard in his only commercial &lt;a href=\"film%20theater\"&gt;film theater&lt;/a&gt;. However, there is cultural and \"&lt;a href=\"underground%20film\"&gt;underground&lt;/a&gt;\" groups concerned with projecting films at &lt;a href=\"festival\"&gt;festival&lt;/a&gt;s or private &lt;a href=\"cinematheque\"&gt;cinematheque&lt;/a&gt; as a way of cultural development. There is also small groups of self-taught filmmakers who record their own stories. The &lt;a href=\"film%20genre\"&gt;film genre&lt;/a&gt;s with more presence are &lt;a href=\"Documentary%20film\"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nature%20documentary\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drama%20film\"&gt;drama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Art%20film\"&gt;art house&lt;/a&gt; and, recently, &lt;a href=\"Horror%20film\"&gt;horror&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Found%20footage%20%28appropriation%29\"&gt;found footage&lt;/a&gt; in \"General Cemetery\". At first, with Wong Rengifo, was shot &lt;a href=\"Slice%20of%20life\"&gt;slice-of-life&lt;/a&gt;/documentary films\nTourism.\nTourism is one of the most vital industries in Iquitos, which has a growing reputation as a &lt;a href=\"honeypot%20%28geography%29\"&gt;honeypot&lt;/a&gt; due to its location on the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20River\"&gt;Amazon River&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Seven%20Wonders%20of%20Nature\"&gt;seven natural wonders of the world&lt;/a&gt;. Through the years, Iquitos receives a considerable number of foreigners; the tourist index grew by international flights offered by the city's airport. Tourism in the city formed into European-style architecture, cuisine, drinks, art, culture, worldview, Spanish accent and historical references of Loreto. Iquitos has adequate infrastructure to accommodate tourists from all levels. It has a 5-star hotel, many of 3-, 2-, and 1-star rating.\nThe major tourist attractions include Barrio de Bel\u00e9n, Plaza de Armas, &lt;a href=\"Casa%20de%20Fierro\"&gt;Casa de Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, Ex Hotel Palace, Iglesia Matriz de Iquitos, Allpahuayo Mishana; Embarcadero Bellavista-Nanay, ethnic communities located around the city, Quistococha Resort and Zoo; Mercado Artesanal of San Juan. &lt;a href=\"Iperu%2C%20tourist%20information%20and%20assistance\"&gt;iper\u00fa&lt;/a&gt; is the leading tourist guide service that is offered to tourists at the airport and the city center of the city.\nThe city is also home to unique tourist companies as Amazonia Expeditions, Maniti Camp Expeditions, Otorongo Expeditions, Amazon Golf Course, and Project Amazonas (dedicated to research and conservation).

The following year, in 2011, the index fell to 46,000 tourist foreigners, which expects 10% rise rapidly in 2013 with international flights opened in July 2012 and the Amazon River as a natural wonder.\n&lt;a href=\"Spiritual%20tourism\"&gt;Spiritual tourism&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ayahuasca\"&gt;Ayahuasca&lt;/a&gt; is known as a major cultural landmark, and &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;mystic&lt;/a&gt; tourism has increased in Iquitos in recent years. The drink, made from the vine \"&lt;a href=\"Banisteriopsis%20caapi\"&gt;Banisteriopsis caapi&lt;/a&gt;\", is investigated by the Western people with a medicinal purpose and study, and was named the nation's cultural heritage.\nDangers, however, still exist when coming into contact with the drug. Shamans are not regulated and none have proof of credentials. While deaths in Iquitos are rare, they have been reported, including Frenchman Fabrice Champion and American Kyle Nolan.\nIquitos is home to the annual Amazonian Shamanism Conference. Here, like-minded individuals meet in Iquitos yearly to discuss Ayahuasca.\nAmazon commemorative capital.\nIquitos is home to the , &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"commemorative%20plaque\"&gt;commemorative plaque&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20River\"&gt;Amazon River&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Basin\"&gt;basin&lt;/a&gt; as one of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Seven%20Wonders%20of%20Nature\"&gt;seven natural wonders of the world&lt;/a&gt;, which was granted on 13 August 2012 by Fernand Weber, founder of &lt;a href=\"New7Wonders%20of%20Nature\"&gt;New7Wonders&lt;/a&gt;. The distinction is shared with &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil, &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"French%20Guiana\"&gt;French Guiana&lt;/a&gt;, however, recognition was given to Peru which originally ran for the Amazon through the Regional Government of Loreto based in Iquitos.\nThe awards show was held in Iquitos. It began with a massive parade along Avenida Qui\u00f1onez, and eventually culminated in the main day, 13 August, divided into two sessions throughout the day: the first in the confluence of the Itaya and &lt;a href=\"Nanay%20river\"&gt;Nanay&lt;/a&gt; in the afternoon, and the second on 28 July Square of the city at night. The event received intense international attention. Similar to &lt;a href=\"Machu%20Picchu\"&gt;Machu Picchu&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;wonder of the world&lt;/a&gt;, Iquitos, as the main entrance to the Amazon, expects great tourist revenue.\nThe &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Peru\"&gt;President of Peru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ollanta%20Humala\"&gt;Ollanta Humala&lt;/a&gt;, next to the First Lady Nadine Heredia and Loreto Regional President Ivan Vasquez received the award. Jean Paul de la Fuente, New7Wonders foundation director, said positively on the image of Iquitos:\nHowever, despite the great satisfaction, the award caused polarized reactions indicating that the Regional Government of Loreto would be on duty to plan better &lt;a href=\"urban%20development\"&gt;urban development&lt;/a&gt; in Iquitos for the forecasted intense tourism. The negative scrutiny aimed at disorganized and massive &lt;a href=\"Sewerage\"&gt;sewer&lt;/a&gt; construction was damaging the city streets, causing discomfort and accidents in traffic and littering the aesthetic image of Iquitos. Several \"iquite\u00f1os\" citizens criticized it via &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpanish accent.\nIquitos is also attractive for its &lt;a href=\"Amazonic%20Spanish\"&gt;Amazonic Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"dialect\"&gt;dialect&lt;/a&gt; of Spanish spoken in the Amazon. The dialect is most noticeable in speech than in writing, such as [f] and [x] are &lt;a href=\"allophone\"&gt;allophone&lt;/a&gt;s, (e.g., Juana is pronounced /fana/), especially when it is next to one or semivowel. (\"Los fr\u00edos de San Juan\"; \"Los fr\u00edos de San F\u00e4n\"), the double preposing and possessive genitive (De Antonio sus amigos; From Antonio his friends), and the preemption of &lt;a href=\"Article%20%28grammar%29\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;s against the names (\"Juana\", \"L\u00e4 Fuana\"). There are also other languages spoken as &lt;a href=\"Iquito%20language\"&gt;Iquito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yagua%20language\"&gt;Yagua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ese%20Ejja%20language\"&gt;Ese Ejja&lt;/a&gt;, or other native languages in Loreto, and foreign languages like English and French because of increasing globalization.\nCuisine.\n&lt;a href=\"Juane\"&gt;Juane&lt;/a&gt; is one of the main dishes of cuisine of the Peruvian jungle. It is widely consumed during the Catholic &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20San%20Juan\"&gt;Feast of San Juan&lt;/a&gt; (St. John), held on 24 June each year. The dish was named in honor of San Juan Bautista. The dish could have a &lt;a href=\"pre-Columbian\"&gt;pre-Columbian&lt;/a&gt; origin. With the arrival of the Spanish, missionaries popularized the Biblical story of &lt;a href=\"Salome\"&gt;Salome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20the%20Baptist\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Herodias\"&gt;Herodias&lt;/a&gt;. Some believe the dish's name comes from the reference to the head of San Juan.\n Another popular dish is &lt;a href=\"Tacacho\"&gt;Tacacho&lt;/a&gt;, made from fried slices of plaintain mashed with &lt;a href=\"chicharon\"&gt;chicharon&lt;/a&gt;es (fried pork fat). It is usually accompanied with &lt;a href=\"chorizo\"&gt;chorizo&lt;/a&gt; (fried sausage) making it a savory combination. The dish is typical of Iquitos as well as the Peruvian Amazon. It is widespread in the rest of the country. The term \"tacacho\" derives from the &lt;a href=\"Quechua%20languages\"&gt;Quechua&lt;/a&gt; term, \"taka chu\", which means beaten. Tacacho consumption varies depending on the region where it is made. In Madre de Dios and San Mart\u00edn, many people eat tacachos for breakfast, while in other regions, it is a dish served at lunch or dinner. In the San Mart\u00edn region, tacacho is included in the Christmas dinner. In the Amazon region of Ecuador, the dish is known as \"bolon\". It has a counterpart in the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20islands\"&gt;Caribbean islands&lt;/a&gt;, where it is called \"mofongo\".\nSport.\n&lt;a href=\"Colegio%20Nacional%20de%20Iquitos\"&gt;Colegio Nacional de Iquitos&lt;/a&gt; is a football team based in Iquitos. In 2005 the city's football community received the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Fair%20Play%20Award\"&gt;FIFA Fair Play Award&lt;/a&gt; as a result of being one of the five host cities for the &lt;a href=\"2005%20FIFA%20U-17%20World%20Championship\"&gt;2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship&lt;/a&gt;."
