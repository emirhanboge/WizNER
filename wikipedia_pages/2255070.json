    "text": "KTIC (840 &lt;a href=\"AM%20broadcasting\"&gt;AM&lt;/a&gt;) is a &lt;a href=\"radio%20station\"&gt;radio station&lt;/a&gt; broadcasting a &lt;a href=\"country%20music\"&gt;country music&lt;/a&gt; format. Like its sister music station &lt;a href=\"KTIC-FM\"&gt;KTIC-FM&lt;/a&gt;, it is licensed to &lt;a href=\"West%20Point%2C%20Nebraska\"&gt;West Point, Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The station serves eastern &lt;a href=\"Nebraska\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sioux%20City%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Sioux City&lt;/a&gt; area. The station is currently owned by the &lt;a href=\"Nebraska%20Rural%20Radio%20Association\"&gt;Nebraska Rural Radio Association&lt;/a&gt; and features programming from &lt;a href=\"Citadel%20Media\"&gt;ABC Radio&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main focus of KTIC is to provide area &lt;a href=\"farmers\"&gt;farmers&lt;/a&gt; with the most current market information from the Rural Radio Network. Futures Updates and Ag News plays every hour during the trading day at 10 and 40 minutes past each hour. News and weather updates come at the bottom of each hour with &lt;a href=\"ABC%20news\"&gt;ABC news&lt;/a&gt; as well as more regionally centered news being the main focus. Many agricultural organizations in the area have programming slots on KTIC to accommodate the interests of the farmers and &lt;a href=\"ranchers\"&gt;ranchers&lt;/a&gt; in the area. Two low-powered translators at 98.3 FM in West Point and 98.7 FM in &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%2C%20Nebraska\"&gt;Norfolk&lt;/a&gt; simulcast KTIC's programming.\nKTIC must shut down its main AM transmitter at night in order to protect &lt;a href=\"clear-channel%20station\"&gt;clear-channel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"WHAS%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WHAS&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Louisville%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt;, which is also located on AM 840. As such, its operating hours vary depending on the time of year. However, the translators remain on the air 24 hours a day."
