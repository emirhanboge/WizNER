    "text": "Hopewell Valley Vineyards is a &lt;a href=\"winery\"&gt;winery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hopewell%20Township%2C%20Mercer%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Hopewell Township&lt;/a&gt; (mailing address is &lt;a href=\"Pennington%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Pennington&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Mercer County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"vineyard\"&gt;vineyard&lt;/a&gt; was first planted in 2001, and opened to the public in 2003. Hopewell Valley has 25 acres of grapes under cultivation, and produces 6,000 cases of wine per year. The winery is named for the region where it is located.\nWines and other products.\nHopewell Valley Vineyards produces wine from &lt;a href=\"Barbera\"&gt;Barbera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brachetto\"&gt;Brachetto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cabernet%20Sauvignon\"&gt;Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chambourcin\"&gt;Chambourcin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chardonnay\"&gt;Chardonnay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merlot\"&gt;Merlot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muscat%20Blanc%20%C3%A0%20Petits%20Grains\"&gt;Muscat blanc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pinot%20gris\"&gt;Pinot gris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sangiovese\"&gt;Sangiovese&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vidal%20blanc\"&gt;Vidal blanc&lt;/a&gt; grapes. Hopewell Valley also sells &lt;a href=\"masonry%20oven\"&gt;brick oven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pizza\"&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt;s, and makes &lt;a href=\"olive%20oil\"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"olive\"&gt;olive&lt;/a&gt;s grown in &lt;a href=\"Tuscany%2C%20Italy\"&gt;Tuscany&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only winery in New Jersey that produces wine from Brachetto, which is a red \"&lt;a href=\"Vitis%20vinifera\"&gt;vinifera&lt;/a&gt;\" grape &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Piedmont\"&gt;Piedmont&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; that is often used to make &lt;a href=\"sparkling%20wine\"&gt;sparkling wine&lt;/a&gt;s. Hopewell Valley is not located within one of New Jersey's three &lt;a href=\"American%20Viticultural%20Area\"&gt;viticultural area&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLicensing and associations.\nHopewell Valley has a &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20wine%23Winery%20licenses%2C%20taxation%2C%20and%20regulation\"&gt;plenary winery license&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Division%20of%20Alcoholic%20Beverage%20Control\"&gt;New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control&lt;/a&gt;, which allows it to produce an unrestricted amount of wine, operate up to 15 off-premises sales rooms, and ship up to 12 cases per year to consumers in-state or out-of-state. The winery is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20State%20Wine%20Growers%20Association\"&gt;Garden State Wine Growers Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nControversy and advocacy.\nHopewell Valley has had conflicts with municipal authorities regarding the sale of food, and the hosting of events at the winery. The Hopewell Township &lt;a href=\"town%20council\"&gt;council&lt;/a&gt; expressed concerns that the winery created excessive noise and traffic, and was functioning as an unlicensed &lt;a href=\"restaurant\"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. In 2011, the Mercer County Agriculture Development Board and the New Jersey Agriculture Development Committee decided that the winery could sell &lt;a href=\"snack%20food\"&gt;snack food&lt;/a&gt;s (e.g., &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt;, pizza) and hold &lt;a href=\"wine%20festival\"&gt;wine festival&lt;/a&gt;s, but could not serve meals or host weddings or other catered events without the town's permission. Although Hopewell Valley Vineyards is not on &lt;a href=\"farmland%20preservation\"&gt;preserved farmland&lt;/a&gt;, it has advocated changing state law to allow more events to be held by preserved farms."
