    "text": "German submarine \"U-3519\" was a &lt;a href=\"Type%20XXI%20submarine\"&gt;Type XXI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt;\" during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The \"&lt;a href=\"Elektroboot\"&gt;Elektroboot&lt;/a&gt;e\" submarine was &lt;a href=\"Keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 19 September 1944 at the &lt;a href=\"Schichau-Werke\"&gt;Schichau-Werke&lt;/a&gt; yard at &lt;a href=\"Danzig\"&gt;Danzig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 23 November 1944, and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 6 January 1945 under the command of \"&lt;a href=\"Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant\"&gt;Kapit\u00e4nleutnant&lt;/a&gt;\" Richard von Harpe.\n\"U-3519\" was a brand new, high technology electric boat which could run constantly submerged rather than having to surface to recharge her batteries every day the way submarines until that point had had to do. However, these advanced vessels were introduced to the \"&lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt;\" only late in 1944, much too late to influence the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic\"&gt;Battle of the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;, and too late for many of them to serve in an offensive capacity at all.\nWith the end of the war near, training on U-boats had dropped to a minimum due to lack of fuel, falling morale and the effectiveness of allied attacks on U-boat construction and preparation. The exception to this were the new Type XXI boats, which continued to train in the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;. To prevent this, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; dropped thousands of &lt;a href=\"Naval%20mine\"&gt;sea mines&lt;/a&gt; into German territorial waters, in the hope that submarines entering or leaving harbour or training in shallow waters would be lost on them. This is what destroyed \"U-3519\" on 2 March 1945, when she ran afoul of an air-dropped mine near &lt;a href=\"Warnem%C3%BCnde\"&gt;Warnem\u00fcnde&lt;/a&gt;, in position and sank to the bottom taking all 65 of her crew with her.\nDesign.\nLike all &lt;a href=\"Type%20XXI%20submarine\"&gt;Type XXI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt;s, \"U-3519\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a beam of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two &lt;a href=\"MAN%20SE\"&gt;MAN SE&lt;/a&gt; supercharged six-cylinder M6V40/46KBB diesel engines each providing , two &lt;a href=\"Siemens-Schuckert\"&gt;Siemens-Schuckert&lt;/a&gt; GU365/30 &lt;a href=\"Motor%E2%80%93generator\"&gt;double-acting&lt;/a&gt; electric motors each providing , and two Siemens-Schuckert &lt;a href=\"Silent%20running%20%28submarine%29\"&gt;silent running&lt;/a&gt; GV232/28 electric motors each providing .\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . When running on silent motors the boat could operate at a speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate at for ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"U-3519\" was fitted with six &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s in the bow and four &lt;a href=\"2%20cm%20FlaK%2030\"&gt;C/30&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"anti-aircraft%20warfare\"&gt;anti-aircraft guns&lt;/a&gt;. She could carry twenty-three &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es or seventeen torpedoes and twelve &lt;a href=\"Naval%20mine\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20company\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; was five officers and fifty-two men."
