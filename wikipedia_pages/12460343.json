    "text": "The Teresa Herrera Trophy () is an annual &lt;a href=\"Season%20%28sports%29\"&gt;pre-season&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; tournament hosted by &lt;a href=\"Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a\"&gt;Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Riazor\"&gt;Estadio Riazor&lt;/a&gt;.\nEstablished in 1946, it is the third oldest professional football tournament in Spain (behind the &lt;a href=\"Trofeo%20Playa%20y%20Sol\"&gt;Trofeo Playa y Sol&lt;/a&gt; (1901) and the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20San%20Pedro\"&gt;Copa San Pedro&lt;/a&gt; (1941)). The matches are usually played at Estadio Riazor during the second half of August, and since 1990 the tournament always features local club Deportivo.\nHistory.\nFirst played in 1946, the competition originally began as a means to raise money for the poor of the city of A Coru\u00f1a in &lt;a href=\"Galicia%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Galicia&lt;/a&gt;, Northern Spain. The trophy is named in honour of an 18th-century local woman who was famed for her work with the region's poor.\nThe first match in 1946 was a game between &lt;a href=\"Sevilla%20FC\"&gt;Sevilla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Bilbao\"&gt;Athletic Club&lt;/a&gt;; Sevilla won the match 3\u20132.\nWomen's tournament.\nSince 2013 a women's football trophy is also held. Until 2016, when Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a created its women's football section, the tournament was hosted by a local women's team.\nThe inaugural edition was contested by the two top local teams, second tier &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20CF\"&gt;Victoria CF&lt;/a&gt; and third tier &lt;a href=\"Orz%C3%A1n%20SD\"&gt;Orz\u00e1n SD&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2014 the match was played in Riazor for the first time, and it featured a foreign opponent, &lt;a href=\"Boavista%20FC%20%28women%29\"&gt;Boavista FC&lt;/a&gt;. A qualifier tournament for several local teams was arranged, which was won by defending champion Victoria. Boavista played with old Deportivo uniforms since their own were stolen.\nIn 2015, Victoria again made it to the Trophy after beating Orz\u00e1n on penalties, but this time it suffered a crushing defeated against 3-times &lt;a href=\"Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20%28women%29\"&gt;national champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rayo%20Vallecano%20%28women%29\"&gt;Rayo Vallecano&lt;/a&gt;."
