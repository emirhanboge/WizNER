    "text": "Lionel-No\u00ebl Royer (December 25, 1852 \u2013 30 June 1926) was a French painter. He was most famous for painting large scenes of the life of &lt;a href=\"Joan%20of%20Arc\"&gt;Joan of Arc&lt;/a&gt; in the in &lt;a href=\"Domr%C3%A9my-la-Pucelle\"&gt;Domr\u00e9my&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife and work.\nLionel Royer was born in &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau-du-Loir\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau-du-Loir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sarthe%20%28department%29\"&gt;Sarthe&lt;/a&gt; on December 25, 1852.\nHe volunteered before his 18th birthday for the &lt;a href=\"Franco-Prussian%20War\"&gt;Franco-Prussian War&lt;/a&gt; and took part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Loigny-Poupry\"&gt;Battle of Loigny-Poupry&lt;/a&gt; on December 2, 1870 under the command of General &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Charette\"&gt;Athanase de Charrette de la Contrie&lt;/a&gt;. Contrie, having noticed Royer's artistic talent, offered to finance his studies at the &lt;a href=\"%C3%89cole%20nationale%20sup%C3%A9rieure%20des%20Beaux-Arts\"&gt;\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts&lt;/a&gt; in Paris.\nRoyer became a pupil of &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Cabanel\"&gt;Alexandre Cabanel&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=\"William-Adolphe%20Bouguereau\"&gt;William-Adolphe Bouguereau&lt;/a&gt;. He obtained the \"&lt;a href=\"Prix%20de%20Rome\"&gt;Prix de Rome&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1882. He became a &lt;a href=\"portraitist\"&gt;portraitist&lt;/a&gt; and, especially, a painter of historical scenes. His best-known works are \"&lt;a href=\"Vercing%C3%A9torix\"&gt;Vercing\u00e9torix&lt;/a&gt; Throwing his Weapons at the Feet of Caesar\" (1899), and the decoration of the Basilica of Domr\u00e9my dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Joan%20of%20Arc\"&gt;Joan of Arc&lt;/a&gt;. In illustrated supplements of newspapers of the era, he was a commentator on current affairs, in particular supplying drawings of \"&lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Dreyfus\"&gt;Alfred Dreyfus&lt;/a&gt; in his prison\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Auguste%20Comte\"&gt;Auguste Comte&lt;/a&gt; and his three muses.\"\nIn memory of his participation in the battle of Loigny, he donated two paintings to the rebuilt church of this village, the first representing the mass attended by the volunteers before leaving for the battle and the second depicting the nocturnal agony of the severely wounded &lt;a href=\"Louis-Gaston%20de%20Sonis\"&gt;General de Sonis&lt;/a&gt; on the battlefield. In 1897, he made a gift to the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 historique et arch\u00e9ologique du &lt;a href=\"Maine%20%28province%29\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;\" (of which he was a member, as was fellow artist &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Maignan\"&gt;Albert Maignan&lt;/a&gt;) of ten &lt;a href=\"watercolors\"&gt;watercolors&lt;/a&gt; depicting the \"Life of Joan of Arc\", which had been unsuccessful entries in a contest of 1893 for new designs for windows in &lt;a href=\"Orl%C3%A9ans%20Cathedral\"&gt;Orl\u00e9ans Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The battle scenes at Orl\u00e9ans before the fortress or at &lt;a href=\"Compi%C3%A8gne\"&gt;Compi\u00e8gne&lt;/a&gt; offer Royer, the painter of historical scenes, an opportunity to demonstrate his skill in composition, with the tangle of armour-clad bodies and the play of lances. To elicit emotion, both allegory and the marvellous come to the aid of history. [...] Lionel Royer relies heavily on the precise depiction of historical sites. [...] Joan, alone in the foreground, is the means by which a possible reconciliation between the political and religious spheres is suggested. [...] By the evocative synthesis he achieves and the deep feeling he introduces here, the painter leaves interpretation open to each observer.\" (Chantal Bouchon - \"Revue Historique et Arch\u00e9ologique du Maine\")\nRoyer reprised this Johannic iconography (assisted by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Lorin\"&gt;Charles Lorin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chartres\"&gt;Chartres&lt;/a&gt;, master glazier) at the basilica of &lt;a href=\"Domr%C3%A9my\"&gt;Domr\u00e9my&lt;/a&gt;. In the window entitled \"D\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e de Fierbois par un ange\", the face of &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Poton%20de%20Xaintrailles\"&gt;Jean Poton de Xaintrailles&lt;/a&gt; bears the features of the architect &lt;a href=\"Paul%20S%C3%A9dille\"&gt;Paul S\u00e9dille&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Despite indications of the influence of the figures by &lt;a href=\"Raphael\"&gt;Raphael&lt;/a&gt;esque and &lt;a href=\"Ingres\"&gt;Ingres&lt;/a&gt;esque reminiscences, these windows have a connotation of appeals to vengeance, in the vicinity of Domr\u00e9my, so charged with symbolic significance.\" (Chantal Bouchon - \"Revue Historique et Arch\u00e9ologique du Maine\")\nRoyer had two daughters and a son. The son, who planned to become a priest, was injured in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and died shortly after. The two girls raised families in France and &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. Lionel Royer died in &lt;a href=\"Neuilly-sur-Seine\"&gt;Neuilly-sur-Seine&lt;/a&gt; on June 30, 1926."
