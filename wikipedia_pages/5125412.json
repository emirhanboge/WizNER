    "text": "Flying Cloud Airport is a public &lt;a href=\"airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; located in the city of &lt;a href=\"Eden%20Prairie%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Eden Prairie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hennepin%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Hennepin County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, United States, about 11 miles (18\u00a0km) southwest of the &lt;a href=\"central%20business%20district\"&gt;central business district&lt;/a&gt; (CBD) of &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nThe airport was created in 1941 when the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; was training pilots for &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The Navy made arrangements with a local farmer, &lt;a href=\"John%20R.%20Cummins%20Farmhouse\"&gt;Martin \"Pappy\" Grill&lt;/a&gt;, to use a grass landing strip. Pilots flying from Wold-Chamberlain Field, now &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis-St.%20Paul%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, would use this field for practicing approaches. After the war, Grill sold the field and some adjoining land to American Aviation, Inc. John Stuber named the field \"Flying Cloud Airport\" to reflect local Indian lore and flying. The &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Airports%20Commission\"&gt;Metropolitan Airports Commission&lt;/a&gt; bought the airport in 1948 and paved the runway. The MAC built a control tower in 1963. By 1966, it was ranked the second-busiest airport in the central United States, behind &lt;a href=\"Chicago-O%27Hare%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Chicago-O'Hare International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. In 1968, with 446,198 takeoffs and landings, it was the ninth-busiest airport in the United States. Today it is designated by the FAA as a reliever airport and aircraft are restricted to or less, except in an emergency situation or when operated by the U.S. Government.\nBecause of the airport's proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Valleyfair\"&gt;Valleyfair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"amusement%20park\"&gt;amusement park&lt;/a&gt;, the park's rides are restricted in height by FAA regulations.\nIn 2020 the airport received a $157,000 &lt;a href=\"CARES%20Act\"&gt;CARES Act&lt;/a&gt; award.\nFacilities and aircraft.\nFlying Cloud Airport covers an area of 543 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s (220 &lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;ha&lt;/a&gt;) at an &lt;a href=\"elevation\"&gt;elevation&lt;/a&gt; of 906 feet (276 m) above &lt;a href=\"mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;mean sea level&lt;/a&gt;. It has three &lt;a href=\"asphalt\"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt; paved &lt;a href=\"runway\"&gt;runway&lt;/a&gt;s. \nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2014, the airport had 75,842 aircraft operations, an average of 208 per day: 95% &lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt;, 4% &lt;a href=\"air%20taxi\"&gt;air taxi&lt;/a&gt; and less than 1% &lt;a href=\"military%20aviation\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;. In September 2017, there were 299 aircraft based at this airport: 237 single-engine, 39 multi-engine, 15 &lt;a href=\"jet%20aircraft\"&gt;jet&lt;/a&gt; and 8 &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn April 30, 2020 an FAA Airport Improvement Program Grant of $722,222 was awarded to rehabilitate taxiways at the airport. \nViking Composite Squadron is a &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Air%20Patrol\"&gt;Civil Air Patrol&lt;/a&gt; squadron that has its airplane hangar at Flying Cloud Airport."
