    "text": "The Drew Barrymore Show is a &lt;a href=\"Broadcast%20syndication\"&gt;first-run syndicated&lt;/a&gt; American &lt;a href=\"talk%20show\"&gt;talk show&lt;/a&gt; hosted by actress &lt;a href=\"Drew%20Barrymore\"&gt;Drew Barrymore&lt;/a&gt;. The show is distributed by &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Media%20Ventures\"&gt;CBS Media Ventures&lt;/a&gt; and debuted on September 14, 2020. In March 2021, the show was renewed for a second season.\nConcept.\nThe program features &lt;a href=\"Human-interest%20story\"&gt;human-interest stories&lt;/a&gt;, celebrity guests, lifestyle segments and field pieces.\nProduction.\nBarrymore shot a &lt;a href=\"Television%20pilot\"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; for the show in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; in August 2019, aiming for a fall 2020 launch. Barrymore had previously circled a talk show deal with &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.%20Television%20Studios\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Telepictures\"&gt;Telepictures&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, but a pilot never came to fruition, in part because of a lukewarm response from prospective station groups at the time.\nAccording to Barrymore, a big part of the appeal of wanting to host a talk show was that it would allow her to maintain a reasonable lifestyle as the mother of two young girls, in contrast to working on a film set where it\u2019s not unusual for actors to work \u201c4 a.m. to 11 p.m.\u201d. Barrymore also said of \"The Drew Barrymore Show\" \u201cI\u2019m in the joy business. I don\u2019t carry the umbrella of darkness with me. I didn\u2019t want to let go of everything I\u2019ve done and who I was. I wanted to make a new application of all that in a way that better served me schedule-wise.\u201d\nBarrymore debuted several digital series in the lead-up to her broadcast debut that included \u201cThe Making of the \"Drew Barrymore Show\"\u201d and conversations with talk-show hosts who have inspired her in \u201cThe Art of the Interview.\u201d This particular series included Barrymore's conversations with &lt;a href=\"Gayle%20King\"&gt;Gayle King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Cohen\"&gt;Andy Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Fallon\"&gt;Jimmy Fallon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Whoopi%20Goldberg\"&gt;Whoopi Goldberg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Evans%20%28interviewer%29\"&gt;Sean Evans&lt;/a&gt;.\nBarrymore also launched \u201cDrew's Movie Nite\u201d, in which she would invite fans to join her in a live &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; watch party. The series kicked off on July 30, 2020 with the &lt;a href=\"Nickelodeon\"&gt;Nickelodeon&lt;/a&gt; broadcast of the 1997 film \"&lt;a href=\"Good%20Burger\"&gt;Good Burger&lt;/a&gt;\". Also featured in the interview were the stars of \"Good Burger\", &lt;a href=\"Kel%20Mitchell\"&gt;Kel Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kenan%20Thompson\"&gt;Kenan Thompson&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next edition of \u201cDrew's Movie Nite\u201d was the Nickelodeon broadcast of \"\" from 2015 on September 3, 2020. This time, Barrymore interviewed the voice of &lt;a href=\"SpongeBob%20SquarePants%20%28character%29\"&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Kenny\"&gt;Tom Kenny&lt;/a&gt; and the voice of &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Star\"&gt;Patrick Star&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Fagerbakke\"&gt;Bill Fagerbakke&lt;/a&gt;. The third edition of \u201cDrew's Movie Nite\u201d, this time aired on &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Sunday%20Movie\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; on October 25, 2020, and was the 1996 film \"&lt;a href=\"Scream%20%281996%20film%29\"&gt;Scream&lt;/a&gt;\" starring Barrymore. \u201cDrew's Movie Nite\u201d returned on September 5, 2021 with the CBS broadcast of \"&lt;a href=\"School%20of%20Rock\"&gt;School of Rock&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe show launched in fall 2020 during the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic in the United States&lt;/a&gt;. The launch took place with a small crew at the &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Broadcast%20Center\"&gt;CBS Broadcast Center&lt;/a&gt; in New York, with pandemic-related rules and precautions. Instead of an in-person audience, members of a &lt;a href=\"Videotelephony\"&gt;virtual&lt;/a&gt; crowd would be beamed in via a platform called Audience From Anywhere and projected on a large display behind Barrymore. Meanwhile, guests who live on the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;West Coast&lt;/a&gt; have the option to appear via &lt;a href=\"Chroma%20key\"&gt;green-screen&lt;/a&gt; and sit across from the host. Barrymore said \u201cI think the limitations of the pandemic made us a more modern show. When forced to think differently, we tried to turn every obstacle into an opportunity.\u201d\nBarrymore also fought really hard to have the show be produced &lt;a href=\"Live%20television\"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; at 9 a.m. &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;Eastern Time&lt;/a&gt;. According to Barrymore, she thought it would be appropriate to be doing this where she could speak to the moment rather than risk being a day or two old. Barrymore added that the type of energy when the show came out could be totally unattached. Barrymore also argued against doing a &lt;a href=\"Stay-at-home%20order\"&gt;home-based&lt;/a&gt; show &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20American%20television%20series%20impacted%20by%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;amid&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Impact%20of%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic%20on%20television%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; saying \"I basically kicked and screamed 'I will do this show on a street corner with a camera and me and one person.\" She continued by saying \"I\u2019m not doing a home show. I don\u2019t want to do it. I don\u2019t like watching them.' I love what Jimmy Fallon did with &lt;a href=\"The%20Tonight%20Show%20Starring%20Jimmy%20Fallon\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought a lot of people really rose to the occasion and did some extraordinary things. But the reason a lot of the home shows were so exciting to watch is because they were well-established. I was scared that if I started a home show, I would stay stuck there. It terrified me.\"\nBarrymore also said in regards to her decision to do a live show everyday \u201cIt\u2019s a lot. But you know, what\u2019s the alternative? There\u2019s none. I\u2019m going to burn the (bleep) out of that candle at every moment.\u201d She adds: \"I thought, \u2018If there\u2019s one thing 2020 demands, it\u2019s live television. You have to be up to the second in this day and age. It\u2019s, like, so wild to be a live show that wants to talk about the world we\u2019re living in while not talking about politics or being political or trying to alienate people.\u201d\nThe show was renewed for a second season on March 17, 2021. The show also announced that come its second season, it would be produced with a full-capacity audience in attendance at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York.\nEpisodes.\nThe debut episode featured guest appearances by Barrymore's former co-stars &lt;a href=\"Cameron%20Diaz\"&gt;Cameron Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucy%20Liu\"&gt;Lucy Liu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Sandler\"&gt;Adam Sandler&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe September 25, 2020 episode featured Barrymore reuniting with her ex-husband &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Green\"&gt;Tom Green&lt;/a&gt; after having not spoken to each other in over 15 years. The two reminisced on their time together and years apart, which made Barrymore cry after she realized how much time had passed.\u00a0\nThe October 12, 2020 episode featured Barrymore interviewing &lt;a href=\"Chloe%20Fineman\"&gt;Chloe Fineman&lt;/a&gt; following Fineman's impersonation of Barrymore on the October 3, 2020 &lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20Live%20%28season%2046%29\"&gt;edition&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20Live\"&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/a&gt;\". Barrymore said to the second-year \"SNL\" player \"I\u2019m really nervous to meet you, I\u2019m so excited, I\u2019m such a fan,\" for which Fineman responded by saying \u201cI\u2019m your biggest fan, you\u2019re gonna make me cry!\" Fineman added: \u201cI mean doing you was so exciting because you were on the cover of \"&lt;a href=\"InStyle\"&gt;InStyle&lt;/a&gt;\" and the impression that I did this summer started because I really wanted that shirt. It was so cute.\u201d\nAlso on October 12, Barrymore interviewed actress &lt;a href=\"Jessica%20Alba\"&gt;Jessica Alba&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Barrymore co-starred in the 1999 film \"&lt;a href=\"Never%20Been%20Kissed\"&gt;Never Been Kissed&lt;/a&gt;\". Besides reminiscing about their time filming \"Never Been Kissed\", Barrymore and Alba danced together as they took on &lt;a href=\"TikTok\"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20most-liked%20TikTok%20videos\"&gt;\"Ahi Challenge\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the October 16, 2020 episode, Barrymore invited psychic Anna Raimondi to give her a &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20reading\"&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt;. Raimondi said that she sensed the presence of a \"&lt;a href=\"judge\"&gt;judge&lt;/a&gt;\". This revelation revelation caused Barrymore to burst into tears, explaining that it must be David, the dead relative of her ex-husband Will Kopelman who was a judge. But according to Kopelman, that judge in question at the time of the episode's airing, was very much alive. Kopelman soon called Raimondi a \u201csubmental hack working the talk show circuit.\u201d A representative for Barrymore later clarified, \u201cThe grandfather of Will is Frank, who was a judge and is deceased. David is\u2026Will\u2019s uncle, who\u2019s alive and also a judge. That was the confusion.\u201d\nFor the October 30, 2020 episode, Barrymore celebrated &lt;a href=\"Halloween\"&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt; by dressing up as &lt;a href=\"Glinda%20the%20Good%20Witch\"&gt;Glinda the Good Witch&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29\"&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/a&gt;\". Barrymore was joined by &lt;a href=\"Ross%20Mathews\"&gt;Ross Mathews&lt;/a&gt;, who was costumed as the twister that carries &lt;a href=\"Dorthy%20Gale\"&gt;Dorothy&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20Oz\"&gt;Oz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Park%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Ashley Park&lt;/a&gt;, who sang \"&lt;a href=\"Over%20the%20Rainbow\"&gt;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe November 6, 2020 episode featured Barrymore in the \"Drew's News\" segment revive her teen character from \"Never Been Kissed\", Josie \"Grossie\" Geller. Sporting her satin pink prom dress, matching scrunchie and braces, Josie stepped straight out of 1988 for the bit\u2014with no knowledge of anything that's happened since then. Josie subsequently became a recurring &lt;a href=\"sketch%20comedy\"&gt;sketch comedy&lt;/a&gt; part of the series, with Barrymore interviewing the cast of \"&lt;a href=\"Dear%20Evan%20Hansen%20%28film%29\"&gt;Dear Evan Hansen&lt;/a&gt;\" in-character as Josie.\nFor the November 20, 2020 episode, Barrymore teamed with &lt;a href=\"Walmart\"&gt;Walmart+&lt;/a&gt; to present a frontline nurse named Selina and a high school teacher with their dream wedding. But the show's videos posted to &lt;a href=\"YouTube\"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; were soon filled with comments alleging that the &lt;a href=\"Child%20grooming\"&gt;couple met&lt;/a&gt; when she was a 17-year-old student in his &lt;a href=\"physics\"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt; class. Neither the show nor the couple have responded to the allegations.\nThe February 22, 2021 episode coincided with Barrymore's 46th birthday. For the occasion, late-night talk show icon &lt;a href=\"David%20Letterman\"&gt;David Letterman&lt;/a&gt; taped a surprise in-person appearance. Barrymore, who &lt;a href=\"Exhibitionism\"&gt;famously flashed&lt;/a&gt; Letterman on \"&lt;a href=\"Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman\"&gt;The Late Show&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"List_of_Late_Show_with_David_Letterman_episodes%231995\"&gt;in 1995&lt;/a&gt;, said to him \"I'm so grateful that you're here.\" Letterman joked that the \"&lt;a href=\"Zoom%20Video%20Communications\"&gt;Zoomer&lt;/a&gt; thing\" was all his idea.\nDuring the \"Drew's News\" segment on the March 12, 2021 episode, a &lt;a href=\"Censor%20bars\"&gt;black bar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jennifer%20Lopez\"&gt;Jennifer Lopez&lt;/a&gt;'s cleavage when a photo of her iconic &lt;a href=\"Green%20Versace%20dress%20of%20Jennifer%20Lopez\"&gt;green Versace dress&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"42nd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;2000 Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt; was displayed. Rich Juzwiak of \"&lt;a href=\"Jezebel%20%28website%29\"&gt;Jezebel&lt;/a&gt;\" said \"So iconic is this dress it inspired the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Google%20Images\"&gt;Google Image&lt;/a&gt; search. &lt;a href=\"Censorship%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Censoring&lt;/a&gt; it, then, makes it seem more salacious than ever, like pointing out the inherent shamefulness of something we were all cool on as an essential piece of &lt;a href=\"Americana\"&gt;Americana&lt;/a&gt;. 'You know you\u2019re watching a daytime show when you\u2019ve got that going on!' Barrymore reasoned. Indeed, the standards for what\u2019s permissible on &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule%20%28daytime%29\"&gt;U.S. daytime network TV&lt;/a&gt; are oddly strict but still, do you think anyone was going to call complaining about a 21-year-old dress that\u2019s practically cultural wallpaper at this point?\"\nWhile playing the game &lt;a href=\"Truth%20value\"&gt;\"Drew or False\"&lt;/a&gt; during the March 24, 2021 episode, Barrymore's \"&lt;a href=\"Poison%20Ivy%20%281992%20film%29\"&gt;Poison Ivy&lt;/a&gt;\" co-star &lt;a href=\"Sara%20Gilbert\"&gt;Sara Gilbert&lt;/a&gt; made the revelation that their kiss in the 1992 erotic thriller was her &lt;a href=\"Same-sex%20relationship\"&gt;\"first girl kiss\"&lt;/a&gt;. Gilbert said \"Now I\u2019m not one to kiss and tell but I have to say -- look now I\u2019m like going to blush -- Drew was the coolest person I ever met and yeah that's what happened.\"\nThe May 6, 2021 episode featured Barrymore getting a tattoo that read \u2018Home is where we are' applied to her right arm by &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Ashley%20Malarkey\"&gt;Ryan Ashley Malarkey&lt;/a&gt;, who was the first female winner of the \"&lt;a href=\"Ink%20Master\"&gt;Ink Master&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Ink%20Master%20%28season%208%29\"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring an interview with Dylan Farrow on May 17, 2021, Barrymore when discussing with Farrow the &lt;a href=\"HBO\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; miniseries \"&lt;a href=\"Allen%20v.%20Farrow\"&gt;Allen v. Farrow&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Woody%20Allen%20sexual%20abuse%20allegation\"&gt;sexual abuse allegations&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Woody%20Allen\"&gt;Woody Allen&lt;/a&gt;, expressed regret over working with him for \"&lt;a href=\"Everyone%20Says%20I%20Love%20You\"&gt;Everyone Says I Love You&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBroadcast.\nThe &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Television%20Stations\"&gt;CBS Television Stations&lt;/a&gt; group was on board to anchor the launch of \"The Drew Barrymore Show\", including on &lt;a href=\"KCBS-TV\"&gt;KCBS-TV&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"WCBS-TV\"&gt;WCBS-TV&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, the show had been cleared to launch on stations representing 85% of U.S. TV households. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Global%20Television%20Network\"&gt;Global&lt;/a&gt; announced on August 18, 2020, that they would pick up \"The Drew Barrymore Show\", before September 14. In &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the show aired on &lt;a href=\"Pay%20television\"&gt;pay TV&lt;/a&gt; channel &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Arena\"&gt;Fox Arena&lt;/a&gt;.\nReception.\nThe premiere episode on September 14, 2020 was \"a real emotional roller coaster\" according to &lt;a href=\"Jezebel%20%28website%29\"&gt;\"Jezebel\"&lt;/a&gt;'s Rich Juzwiak. He added \"The enthusiasm was massive, the veracity was questionable, the performance was distracting. She shifted gears in the next paragraph of her monologue to reintroduce herself, remind us that she is exactly who we think she is, and suggest that she\u2019s so much more. With the impassioned face of a celebrity raising funds on a telethon, Barrymore said emphatically that, 'I\u2019m also someone who is learning all the time, and I\u2019m so excited to figure out this thing called life with you!' Wait, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here? Then she started shouting that, 'We\u2019re gonna learn! Laugh! Cry! Cook! Heal! ALL OF IT!' Well, paint that on a piece of wood and hang it in your country kitchen. 'And I\u2019m committed to putting all aspects of life into this show every day,' she continued. It\u2019s only an hourlong show?\" Juzwiak also said that Barrymore has been a nonstop ball of energy, which can be exhausting and endearing.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;\"Variety\"&lt;/a&gt;'s Daniel D'Addario said that \"The best talk show hosts are made into stars by the medium. To wit: &lt;a href=\"Rosie%20O%27Donnell\"&gt;Rosie O'Donnell&lt;/a&gt; was a well-known comic and actor but hardly the dynamo she eventually became when she began her daily show. She reinvented the medium that had, before her, been dominated by former local news anchor &lt;a href=\"Oprah%20Winfrey\"&gt;Oprah Winfrey&lt;/a&gt;. Both these stars did not bring to bear huge amounts of persona that was already known to the audience, so they had to work to carry across an idea of themself with each episode and segment. At their best, you walked away from their shows knowing O\u2019Donnell and Winfrey in a way you might not otherwise have, before. Drew Barrymore, a newly-minted talk show host with her \"Drew Barrymore Show\" carried in daytime by &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20CBS%20television%20affiliates%20%28by%20U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;CBS stations&lt;/a&gt;, has less of herself to introduce, and, more crucially, less apparent desire to do so.\"\nD'Addario added that Barrymore was hampered in her first week by her reliance on celebrity friends, saying \"Barrymore\u2019s show is squarely in her comfort zone, and as such is in the comfort zone of any celebrity; it\u2019s so soft and unthreatening, though, as to often make us feel we know subjects and interviewer both less well when the interview is done. We hardly need a &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Wallace\"&gt;Mike Wallace&lt;/a&gt;-style expose on the stars Barrymore books; that\u2019d be weird in daytime, and it\u2019s not what viewers look to Barrymore for. But \u2014 speaking as a Barrymore fan who was excited to see her in conversation \u2014 there is as yet untapped potential for her to dig deeper, to show us more of what she really believes or finds important.\"\nWilliam Hughes of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20A.V.%20Club\"&gt;The A.V. Club&lt;/a&gt;\" said that there have been two major takeaways from \"The Drew Barrymore Show\" after one week: \"Drew Barrymore definitely has a lot of cool, famous friends, and Drew Barrymore sometimes acts in ways that are tremendously weird when asked to talk into a camera by herself. The combination has formed some of the most hypnotically, authentically strange TV the internet has had a chance to dine out on in a while, as Barrymore jumps between recreating famous movies she\u2019s made with her buddies, to monologuing, for minutes at a time, about her love of removing stains from T-shirts.\"\nTracy Moore of \"&lt;a href=\"Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt;\" said that it's remarkable that \"something so offbeat is happening on daytime at all\" of the \"low-key insanity\" of \"The Drew Barrymore Show\". Moore also said of Barrymore \"She cooks; she interior designs; she feels. She talks in hashtags, and casually drops quotes from &lt;a href=\"Gayle%20King\"&gt;Gayle King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patti%20Smith\"&gt;Patti Smith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"E.%20E.%20Cummings\"&gt;e.e. cummings&lt;/a&gt;. She is, it seems, genuinely in awe of everyone and everything, a self-described 'human scrapbook of news,' a 'pop culture junkie,' a lover of people and stain removal.\"\nJessica Toomer of \"&lt;a href=\"Uproxx\"&gt;Uproxx&lt;/a&gt;\" proclaimed that 2020 was the year Drew Barrymore blew up the daytime talk show machine. Toomer added that \"Drew Barrymore\u2019s show is all of those things. The kind of mind-numbing &lt;a href=\"social%20experiment\"&gt;social experiment&lt;/a&gt; that rivals the frenzied delirium of a &lt;a href=\"Safdie%20brothers\"&gt;Safdie Brothers&lt;/a&gt; crime saga but interjects just enough &lt;a href=\"PBS\"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"After%20school%20special\"&gt;after-school-special&lt;/a&gt; cheer to quiet the shrieking happening inside your brain as you watch. It\u2019s not pretty all the time. Sometimes, it\u2019s not even coherent. But like a 1994-era &lt;a href=\"Chlo%C3%AB%20Sevigny\"&gt;Chlo\u00eb Sevigny&lt;/a&gt;, it\u2019s the kind of \u201c&lt;a href=\"It%20girl\"&gt;It Girl&lt;/a&gt;\u201d of the talk show universe that you just can\u2019t quite define, but know you should worship anyway.\"\nRatings.\nIn its second week, \"The Drew Barrymore Show\" was down 14&lt;a href=\"Percentage\"&gt;%&lt;/a&gt;, grabbing only 600,000 viewers. \"&lt;a href=\"Hot%20Bench\"&gt;Hot Bench&lt;/a&gt;\", the show that \"The Drew Barrymore Show\" replaced in many markets, was steady at 1.7 million. According to an October 15, 2020 report from \"&lt;a href=\"OK%20Magazine\"&gt;OK Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\", the show had already dropped 38% in ratings since it premiered.\nAccording to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hollywood%20Reporter\"&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;\", the ratings grew by 19 percent in households and 13 percent among women 25-54 in &lt;a href=\"Nielsen%20ratings\"&gt;Nielsen's&lt;/a&gt; metered markets between November 2020 and February 2021."
