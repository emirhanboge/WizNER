Commenting on death threats made against Barnes he said \"I think it's a disgrace and people have to grow up.\" He also accused the coach of the United States team, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Thorburn\"&gt;Peter Thorburn&lt;/a&gt;, of lying when Thorburn stated that there had been a pre-tournament directive that touch judges should not interfere in issues like forward passes. O'Brien later apologized to Thorburn.\nIn November 2009, O'Brien publicly apologized to &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; with regards to the refereeing performance of &lt;a href=\"Stuart%20Dickinson\"&gt;Stuart Dickinson&lt;/a&gt; during an international match against &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.

He was speculated as a potential candidate in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Invercargill%20mayoral%20election\"&gt;2019 Invercargill mayoral election&lt;/a&gt; but decided against it while not ruling out the possibility of a future mayoral run.\nFollowing the resignation of deputy mayor Toni Biddle from the &lt;a href=\"Invercargill%20City%20Council\"&gt;Invercargill City Council&lt;/a&gt;, O'Brien announced his intent to contest the resulting by-election.
