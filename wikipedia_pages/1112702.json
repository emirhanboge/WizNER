    "text": "A royal forest, occasionally \"Kingswood\" (), is an area of land with different definitions in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The term \"&lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;\" in the ordinary modern understanding refers to an area of wooded land; however, the original medieval sense was closer to the modern idea of a \"preserve\" \u2013 i.e. land legally set aside for specific purposes such as royal hunting \u2013 with less emphasis on its composition. There are also differing and contextual interpretations in Continental Europe derived from the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%20Carolingian%20Empire\"&gt;Carolingian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merovingian%20dynasty\"&gt;Merovingian&lt;/a&gt; legal systems.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20England\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon England&lt;/a&gt;, though the kings were great huntsmen, they never set aside areas declared to be \"outside\" (Latin \"foris\") the law of the land. Historians find no evidence of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs (c. 500 to 1066) creating forests. However, under the Norman kings (after 1066), by royal prerogative forest law was widely applied. The law was designed to protect the \"venison\" and the \"vert\", the \"noble\" animals of the chase\u00a0\u2013 notably &lt;a href=\"Red%20deer\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fallow%20deer\"&gt;fallow deer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"roe%20deer\"&gt;roe deer&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"wild%20boar\"&gt;wild boar&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 and the greenery that sustained them. Forests were designed as hunting areas reserved for the &lt;a href=\"monarch\"&gt;monarch&lt;/a&gt; or (by invitation) the &lt;a href=\"aristocracy\"&gt;aristocracy&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"medieval%20hunting\"&gt;medieval hunting&lt;/a&gt;). The concept was introduced by the &lt;a href=\"Normans\"&gt;Normans&lt;/a&gt; to England in the 11th century, and at the height of this practice in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, fully one-third of the land area of southern England was designated as royal forest; at one stage in the 12th century, all of &lt;a href=\"Essex\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt; was afforested, and on his accession &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry II&lt;/a&gt; declared all of &lt;a href=\"Huntingdonshire\"&gt;Huntingdonshire&lt;/a&gt; forest.\nAfforestation, in particular the creation of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Forest\"&gt;New Forest&lt;/a&gt;, figured large in the folk history of the \"&lt;a href=\"Norman%20yoke\"&gt;Norman yoke&lt;/a&gt;\", which magnified what was already a grave social ill: \"the picture of prosperous settlements disrupted, houses burned, peasants evicted, all to serve the pleasure of the foreign tyrant, is a familiar element in the English national story\u00a0... The extent and intensity of hardship and of depopulation have been exaggerated\", &lt;a href=\"H.%20R.%20Loyn\"&gt;H. R. Loyn&lt;/a&gt; observed. Forest law prescribed harsh punishment for anyone who committed any of a range of offences within the forests; by the mid-17th century, enforcement of this law had died out, but many of England's woodlands still bore the title \"Royal Forest\". During the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the practice of reserving areas of land for the sole use of the aristocracy was common throughout Europe.\nRoyal forests usually included large areas of &lt;a href=\"heath%20%28habitat%29\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grassland\"&gt;grassland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wetland\"&gt;wetland&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 anywhere that supported &lt;a href=\"deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"game%20%28food%29\"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, when an area was initially designated forest, any villages, towns and fields that lay within it were also subject to forest law. This could foster resentment as the local inhabitants were then restricted in the use of land they had previously relied upon for their livelihoods; however, common rights were not extinguished, but merely curtailed.\nAreas chosen for Royal Forests.\nThe areas that became Royal Forests were already relatively wild and sparsely populated, and can be related to specific geographic features that made them harder to work as farmland. Prosperous, well-farmed areas were not generally chosen to be afforested; if they were, they tended to lose the status fairly rapidly. In the Scots Highlands, a \"deer forest\" generally has no trees at all.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"South%20West%20England\"&gt;South West&lt;/a&gt; of England, forests extended across the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Jurassic\"&gt;Upper Jurassic&lt;/a&gt; Clay Vale. In &lt;a href=\"the%20Midlands\"&gt;the Midlands&lt;/a&gt;, the clay plain surrounding the &lt;a href=\"River%20Severn\"&gt;River Severn&lt;/a&gt; was heavily wooded. Clay soils in &lt;a href=\"Oxfordshire\"&gt;Oxfordshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buckinghamshire\"&gt;Buckinghamshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huntingdonshire\"&gt;Huntingdonshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northamptonshire\"&gt;Northamptonshire&lt;/a&gt; formed another belt of woodlands.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hampshire\"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berkshire\"&gt;Berkshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Surrey\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt;, woodlands were established on sandy, gravelly acid soils. Marshlands in &lt;a href=\"Lincolnshire\"&gt;Lincolnshire&lt;/a&gt; were afforested. Upland moors too were chosen, such as &lt;a href=\"Dartmoor\"&gt;Dartmoor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exmoor\"&gt;Exmoor&lt;/a&gt; in the South West, and the Peak Forest of &lt;a href=\"Derbyshire\"&gt;Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"North%20York%20Moors\"&gt;The North Yorkshire moors&lt;/a&gt;, a sandstone plateau, had a number of Royal Forests.\nForest law.\n&lt;a href=\"William%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;William the Conqueror&lt;/a&gt;, a great lover of hunting, established the system of forest law. This operated outside the &lt;a href=\"common%20law\"&gt;common law&lt;/a&gt;, and served to protect game animals and their forest habitat from destruction. In the year of his death, 1087, a poem, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Rime%20of%20King%20William\"&gt;The Rime of King William&lt;/a&gt;\", inserted in the &lt;a href=\"Peterborough%20Chronicle\"&gt;Peterborough Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;, expresses English indignation at the forest laws.\nOffences.\nOffences in forest law were divided into two categories: trespass against the vert (the vegetation of the forest) and the venison (the game). The five animals of the forest protected by law were given by &lt;a href=\"John%20Manwood\"&gt;Manwood&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"hart%20%28deer%29\"&gt;hart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20deer\"&gt;hind&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"red%20deer\"&gt;red deer&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hare\"&gt;hare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;. (In England, the boar became extinct in the wild by the 13th century, and the wolf by the late 15th century.) Protection was also said to be extended to the beasts of &lt;a href=\"chase%20%28land%29\"&gt;chase&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Deer\"&gt;buck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Adoe%23Noun\"&gt;doe&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"fallow%20deer\"&gt;fallow deer&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"marten\"&gt;marten&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"roe%20deer\"&gt;roe deer&lt;/a&gt;, and the beasts and fowls of &lt;a href=\"warren%20%28free%29\"&gt;warren&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"hare\"&gt;hare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;coney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pheasant\"&gt;pheasant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"partridge\"&gt;partridge&lt;/a&gt;. The rights of chase and of warren (i.e. to hunt such beasts) were often granted to local nobility for a fee, but were a quite separate concept.\nTrespasses against the vert were rather extensive: they included \"purpresture\", \"&lt;a href=\"assarting\"&gt;assarting&lt;/a&gt;\", clearing forest land for agriculture, and felling trees or clearing shrubs, among others. These laws applied to any land within the boundary of the forest, even if it were freely owned; although the Charter of the Forest in 1217 established that all freemen owning land within the forest enjoyed the rights of \"&lt;a href=\"agistment\"&gt;agistment&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"pannage\"&gt;pannage&lt;/a&gt;\" (see below).\nIn addition, inhabitants of the forest were forbidden to bear hunting weapons, and dogs were banned from the forest; &lt;a href=\"English%20Mastiff\"&gt;mastiffs&lt;/a&gt; were permitted as watchdogs, but they had to have their front claws removed to prevent them from hunting game.\nDisafforested lands on the edge of the forest were known as &lt;a href=\"purlieus\"&gt;purlieus&lt;/a&gt;; agriculture was permitted here and deer escaping from the forest into them was permitted to be killed if causing damage.\nRights and privileges.\nPayment for access to certain rights could provide a useful source of income. Local nobles could be granted a royal licence to take a certain amount of game. The common inhabitants of the forest might, depending on their location, possess a variety of rights: \"&lt;a href=\"Estovers\"&gt;estover&lt;/a&gt;\", the right of taking firewood, \"&lt;a href=\"pannage\"&gt;pannage&lt;/a&gt;\", the right to pasture swine in the forest, \"&lt;a href=\"turbary\"&gt;turbary&lt;/a&gt;\", the right to cut turf (as fuel), and various other rights of pasturage (\"&lt;a href=\"agistment\"&gt;agistment&lt;/a&gt;\") and harvesting the products of the forest. Land might be disafforested entirely, or permission given for &lt;a href=\"assart\"&gt;assart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"purpresture\"&gt;purpresture&lt;/a&gt;.\nOfficers.\nThe justices of the forest were the &lt;a href=\"justice%20in%20eyre\"&gt;justices in eyre&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"verderer\"&gt;verderer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe chief royal official was the warden. As he was often an eminent and preoccupied magnate, his powers were frequently exercised by a deputy. He supervised the &lt;a href=\"forester\"&gt;forester&lt;/a&gt;s and under-foresters, who personally went about preserving the forest and game and apprehending offenders against the law. The &lt;a href=\"agister\"&gt;agister&lt;/a&gt;s supervised pannage and agistment and collected any fees thereto appertaining. The nomenclature of the officers can be somewhat confusing: the rank immediately below the constable were referred to as foresters-in-fee, or, later, \"woodwards\", who held land in the forest in exchange for a rent, and advised the warden. They exercised various privileges within their &lt;a href=\"bailiwick\"&gt;bailiwick&lt;/a&gt;s. Their subordinates were the under-foresters, later referred to as &lt;a href=\"forest%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;. The rangers are sometimes said to be patrollers of the purlieu.\nAnother group, called &lt;a href=\"serjeanty\"&gt;serjeants&lt;/a&gt;-in-fee, and later, foresters-in-fee (not to be confused with the above), held small estates in return for their service in patrolling the forest and apprehending offenders.\nThe forests also had &lt;a href=\"surveyor%20%28surveying%29\"&gt;surveyors&lt;/a&gt;, who determined the boundaries of the forest, and \"regarders\". These last reported to the court of justice-seat and investigated encroachments on the forest and invasion of royal rights, such as assarting. While their visits were infrequent, due to the interval of time between courts, they provided a check against collusion between the foresters and local offenders.\nCourts.\n&lt;a href=\"Commentaries%20on%20the%20Laws%20of%20England\"&gt;Blackstone&lt;/a&gt; gives the following outline of the forest courts, as theoretically constructed:\nIn practice, these fine distinctions were not always observed. In the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Dean\"&gt;Forest of Dean&lt;/a&gt;, swainmote and the court of attachment seem to have been one and the same throughout most of its history. As the courts of justice-seat were held less frequently, the lower courts assumed the power to fine offenders against the forest laws, according to a fixed schedule. The courts of justice-seat crept into disuse, and in 1817, the office of Justice in Eyre was abolished and its powers transferred to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Commissioner%20of%20Woods%20and%20Forests\"&gt;First Commissioner of Woods and Forests&lt;/a&gt;. Courts of swainmote and attachment went out of existence at various dates in the different forests. A Court of Swainmote was re-established in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Forest\"&gt;New Forest&lt;/a&gt; in 1877.\nHistory.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20conquest\"&gt;conquest&lt;/a&gt; of England, the forest, chase and warren lands had been exempted from the &lt;a href=\"common%20law\"&gt;common law&lt;/a&gt; and subject only to the authority of the king, but these customs had faded into obscurity by time of &lt;a href=\"Stuart%20Restoration\"&gt;The Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilliam the Conqueror.\n&lt;a href=\"William%20the%20Conqueror\"&gt;William I&lt;/a&gt;, original enactor of the Forest Law in England, did not harshly penalise offenders. The accusation that he \"laid a law upon it, that whoever slew hart or hind should be &lt;a href=\"Blinding%20%28punishment%29\"&gt;blinded&lt;/a&gt;,\" according to the \"&lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\" is little more than propaganda. &lt;a href=\"William%20Rufus\"&gt;William Rufus&lt;/a&gt;, also a keen hunter, increased the severity of the penalties for various offences to include death and mutilation. The laws were in part codified under the Assize of the Forest (1184) of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry II&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagna Carta.\n&lt;a href=\"Magna%20Carta\"&gt;Magna Carta&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"charter\"&gt;charter&lt;/a&gt; forced upon King &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20England\"&gt;John of England&lt;/a&gt; by the English barons in 1215, contained five clauses relating to royal forests. They aimed to limit, and even reduce, the King's sole rights as enshrined in forest law. The clauses were as follows (taken from translation of the great charter (Magna Carta)):\nCharter of the Forest.\nAfter the death of John, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry III&lt;/a&gt; was compelled to grant the &lt;a href=\"Charter%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Charter of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; (1217), which further reformed the forest law and established the rights of agistment and pannage on private land within the forests. It also checked certain of the extortions of the foresters. An \"Ordinance of the Forest\" under &lt;a href=\"Edward%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward I&lt;/a&gt; again checked the oppression of the officers, and introduced sworn juries in the forest courts.\nGreat Perambulation and after.\nIn 1300 many (if not all) forests were &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aperambulation\"&gt;perambulated&lt;/a&gt; and reduced greatly in their extent, in theory to their extent in the time of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry II&lt;/a&gt;. However, this depended on the determination of local juries, whose decisions often excluded from the Forest lands described in &lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt; as within the forest. Successive kings tried to recover the \"purlieus\" excluded from a forest by the Great Perambulation of 1300. Forest officers periodically fined the inhabitants of the purlieus for failing to attend Forest Court or for forest offences. This led to complaints in Parliament. The king promised to remedy the grievances, but usually did nothing.\nSeveral forests were alienated by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Richard II&lt;/a&gt; and his successors, but generally the system decayed. &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VII&lt;/a&gt; revived \"Swainmotes\" (forest courts) for several forests and held Forest Eyres in some of them. &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; in 1547 placed the forests under the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Augmentations\"&gt;Court of Augmentations&lt;/a&gt; with two Masters and two Surveyors-General. On the abolition of that court, the two surveyors-general became responsible to the Exchequer. Their respective divisions were North and South of the &lt;a href=\"river%20Trent\"&gt;river Trent&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe last serious exercise of forest law by a court of justice-seat (Forest Eyre) seems to have been in about 1635, in an attempt to raise money.\nDisafforestation, sale of forest lands and the Western Rising.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20period\"&gt;Tudor period&lt;/a&gt; and after, forest law had largely become anachronistic, and served primarily to protect timber in the royal forests. &lt;a href=\"James%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;James I&lt;/a&gt; and his ministers &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury\"&gt;Robert Cecil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lionel%20Cranfield%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Middlesex\"&gt;Lionel Cranfield&lt;/a&gt; pursued a policy of increasing revenues from the forests and starting the process of disafforestation.\nCecil made the first steps towards abolition of the forests, as part of James I's policy of increasing his income independently of Parliament. Cecil investigated forests that were unused for royal hunting and provided little revenue from timber sales. &lt;a href=\"Knaresborough%20Forest\"&gt;Knaresborough Forest&lt;/a&gt; in Yorkshire was abolished. Revenues in the Forest of Dean were increased through sales of wood for iron smelting. Enclosures were made in Chippenham and Blackmore for herbage and pannage.\nCranfield commissioned surveys into &lt;a href=\"assart\"&gt;assart&lt;/a&gt; lands of various forests, including Feckenham, Sedgemoor and Selwood, laying the foundations of the wide scale abolition of forests under &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles I&lt;/a&gt;. The commissioners appointed raised over \u00a325,000 by compounding with occupiers, whose ownership was confirmed, subject to a fixed rent. Cranfield's work led directly to the disafforestation of Gillingham Forest in Dorset and Chippenham and Blackmore in Wiltshire. Additionally, he created the model for abolition of the forests followed throughout the 1630s.\nEach disafforestation would start with a commission from the Exchequer, which would survey the forest, determine the lands belonging to the crown, and negotiate compensation for landowners and tenants whose now-traditional rights to use of the land as commons would be revoked. A legal action by the Attorney General would then proceed in the Court of Exchequer against the forest residents for intrusion, which would confirm the settlement negotiated by the Commission. Crown lands would then be granted (leased), usually to prominent courtiers, and often the same figures that had undertaken the commission surveys. Legal complaints about the imposed settlements and compensation were frequent.\nThe disafforestations caused riots and &lt;a href=\"Skimmington\"&gt;Skimmington&lt;/a&gt; processions resulting in the destruction of enclosures and reoccupation of grazing lands in a number of West Country forests, including Gillingham, Braydon and Dean, known as the Western Rising. Riots also took place in Feckenham, Leicester and Malvern. The riots followed the physical enclosure of lands previously used as commons, and frequently led to the destruction of fencing and hedges. Some were said to have had a \"warlike\" character, with armed mobs numbering hundreds, for instance in Feckenham. The rioters in Dean fully destroyed the enclosures surrounding 3,000 acres in groups that numbered thousands of participants.\nThe disturbances tended to involve artisans and cottagers who were not entitled to compensation. The riots were hard to enforce against, due to the lack of efficient militia, and the low born nature of the participants. Ultimately, however, enclosure succeeded, with the exceptions of Dean and Malvern Chase.\nAfter the Restoration.\nThe Forest of Dean was legally re-established in 1668. A Forest Eyre was held for the &lt;a href=\"New%20Forest\"&gt;New Forest&lt;/a&gt; in 1670, and a few for other forests in the 1660s and 1670s, but these were the last. From 1715, both surveyor's posts were held by the same person. The remaining royal forests continued to be managed (in theory, at least) on behalf of the crown. However, the commoners' rights of grazing often seem to have been more important than the rights of the crown.\nIn the late 1780s a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Commission\"&gt;Royal Commission&lt;/a&gt; was appointed to inquire into the condition of Crown woods and those surviving. North of the Trent it found &lt;a href=\"Sherwood%20Forest\"&gt;Sherwood Forest&lt;/a&gt; survived, south of it: the &lt;a href=\"New%20Forest\"&gt;New Forest&lt;/a&gt;, three others in &lt;a href=\"Hampshire\"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, Windsor Forest in &lt;a href=\"Berkshire\"&gt;Berkshire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Dean\"&gt;Forest of Dean&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire\"&gt;Gloucestershire&lt;/a&gt;, Waltham or &lt;a href=\"Epping%20Forest\"&gt;Epping Forest&lt;/a&gt; in Essex, three forests in &lt;a href=\"Northamptonshire\"&gt;Northamptonshire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wychwood\"&gt;Wychwood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oxfordshire\"&gt;Oxfordshire&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these no longer had swainmote courts thus no official supervision. They divided the remaining forests into two classes, those with and without the Crown as major landowner. In certain Hampshire forests and the Forest of Dean, most of the soil belonged to the Crown and these should be reserved to grow timber, to meet the need for &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"shipbuilding\"&gt;shipbuilding&lt;/a&gt;. The others would be inclosed, the Crown receiving an \"allotment\" (compensation) in lieu of its rights.\nIn 1810, responsibility for woods was moved from Surveyors-General (who accounted to the Auditors of Land Revenue) to a new &lt;a href=\"First%20Commissioner%20of%20Woods%20and%20Forests\"&gt;Commission of Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues&lt;/a&gt;. From 1832 to 1851 \"Works and Buildings\" were added to their responsibilities. In 1851, the commissioners again became a &lt;a href=\"Commissioner%20of%20Woods%2C%20Forests%20and%20Land%20Revenues\"&gt;Commissioner of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues&lt;/a&gt;. In 1924, the Royal Forests were transferred to the new &lt;a href=\"Forestry%20Commission\"&gt;Forestry Commission&lt;/a&gt; (now Forestry England).\nSurviving ancient forests.\nForest of Dean.\nThe Forest of Dean was used as a source of &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;ironmaking&lt;/a&gt; within the Forest from 1612 until about 1670. It was the subject of a Reafforestation Act in 1667. Courts continued to be held at the &lt;a href=\"Speech%20House\"&gt;Speech House&lt;/a&gt;, for example to regulate the activities of the &lt;a href=\"Freeminer\"&gt;Freeminer&lt;/a&gt;s. The sale of &lt;a href=\"cordwood\"&gt;cordwood&lt;/a&gt; for charcoal continued until at least the late 18th century. Deer were removed in 1850. The forest is today heavily wooded, as is a substantial formerly privately owned area to the west, now treated as part of the forest. It is managed by Forestry England.\nEpping Forest.\nThe extent of Epping Forest was greatly reduced by inclosure by landowners. The &lt;a href=\"Corporation%20of%20London\"&gt;Corporation of London&lt;/a&gt; wished to see it preserved as an &lt;a href=\"Open%20space%20reserved\"&gt;open space&lt;/a&gt; and obtained an &lt;a href=\"injunction\"&gt;injunction&lt;/a&gt; to throw open some that had been inclosed in the preceding 20 years. In 1875 and 1876, it bought of open waste land. Under the &lt;a href=\"Epping%20Forest%20Act%201878\"&gt;Epping Forest Act 1878&lt;/a&gt;, the forest was disafforested and forest law abolished in respect of it. Instead the corporation was appointed as Conservators of the Forest. The forest is managed through the Epping Forest Committee.\nNew Forest.\nAn Act was passed to remove the deer in 1851, but abandoned when it was realised that the deer were needed to keep open the unwooded \"lawns\" of the forest. An attempt was made to develop the forest for growing wood by a rolling programme of inclosures. In 1875, a &lt;a href=\"Select%20committee%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Select committee&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; recommended against this, leading to the passage of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Forest%20Act%201877\"&gt;New Forest Act 1877&lt;/a&gt;, which limited the Crown's right to inclose, regulated common rights, and reconstituted the Court of Verderers. A further &lt;a href=\"New%20Forest%20Act%201964\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt; was passed in 1964. This forest is also managed by Forestry England.\nSherwood Forest.\nA forest since the end of the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Age\"&gt;Ice Age&lt;/a&gt; (as attested by &lt;a href=\"palynology\"&gt;pollen sampling cores&lt;/a&gt;), Sherwood Forest &lt;a href=\"national%20nature%20reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;National Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt; today encompasses 423.2 hectares, (1,045 acres) surrounding the village of &lt;a href=\"Edwinstowe\"&gt;Edwinstowe&lt;/a&gt;, the site of &lt;a href=\"Thoresby%20Hall\"&gt;Thoresby Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe forest that most people associate with Sherwood Forest is actually named &lt;a href=\"Birklands%20and%20Bilhaugh\"&gt;Birklands and Bilhaugh&lt;/a&gt;. It is a remnant of an older, much larger, royal hunting forest, which derived its name from its status as the \"&lt;a href=\"shire\"&gt;shire&lt;/a&gt; (or sher) wood\" of Nottinghamshire, which extended into several neighbouring counties (shires), bordered on the west along the &lt;a href=\"River%20Erewash\"&gt;River Erewash&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20East%20Derbyshire\"&gt;Forest of East Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt; was compiled in 1086, the forest covered perhaps a quarter of Nottinghamshire in woodland and heath subject to the forest laws.\nRoyal forests by county.\nIreland.\nOnly one royal forest is known to have been formed in the &lt;a href=\"Lordship%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Lordship of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.
