    "text": "H\u00e4gglingen is a &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; in the district of &lt;a href=\"Bremgarten%20%28district%29\"&gt;Bremgarten&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cantons%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;canton&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aargau\"&gt;Aargau&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe first evidence of a settlement comes from &lt;a href=\"tumulus\"&gt;barrow&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Hallstatt%20culture\"&gt;Hallstatt period&lt;/a&gt;. There is also evidence of small &lt;a href=\"Switzerland%20in%20the%20Roman%20era\"&gt;Roman era&lt;/a&gt; settlements.\nThe first mention of modern H\u00e4gglingen is in 1036 when &lt;a href=\"Counts%20of%20Lenzburg\"&gt;Count Ulrich von Lenzburg&lt;/a&gt; granted the church and farm of \"Hekelingen\" to &lt;a href=\"Berom%C3%BCnster\"&gt;Berom\u00fcnster&lt;/a&gt;. In the acknowledgments of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Henry%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Henry III&lt;/a&gt; in 1045, the village of \"Hackelingen\" was mentioned. &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Frederick I Barbarossa&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged the grants to the village in 1173. The &lt;a href=\"Vogt\"&gt;Vogt&lt;/a&gt;ei (bailiwick) went from the Lenzburg family to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Kyburg\"&gt;Kyburgs&lt;/a&gt; and then in 1273 to the Lords of Hallwyl. The &lt;a href=\"High%2C%20middle%20and%20low%20justice\"&gt;high court&lt;/a&gt; rights were exercised by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Habsburg\"&gt;Habsburgs&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Swiss%20Confederacy\"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; conquered the Aargau in 1415. It was not until 1425 that H\u00e4gglingen, which was claimed by &lt;a href=\"Lucerne\"&gt;Lucerne&lt;/a&gt;, came under the authority of the entire Confederacy. It was first assigned to the district court of &lt;a href=\"Wohlenschwil\"&gt;Wohlenschwil&lt;/a&gt; before it became an independent municipality from 1435-1712.\nThe \"Dorfoffnung\" regulations of 1609 include laws for the exploitation of forests and regulated irrigation. At this time H\u00e4gglingen was acting as a fully independent municipality. Between 1611-13, 150 people died of the plague. It was sacked and partly burned in 1656 by Bernese troops.\nThe parish church of St. Michael was built in 1457-66, though only the tower and &lt;a href=\"choir\"&gt;choir&lt;/a&gt; of the original church were retained. The church was expanded in 1638-39, and renovated in 1739. In 1951, the late &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20art\"&gt;gothic&lt;/a&gt; choir &lt;a href=\"fresco\"&gt;fresco&lt;/a&gt;es of 1480-90, which had survived the &lt;a href=\"iconoclasm\"&gt;iconoclasm&lt;/a&gt; of 1529, were discovered.\nIn addition to agriculture and small businesses, the &lt;a href=\"straw%20plaiting\"&gt;straw plaiting&lt;/a&gt; industry started in the 18th Century and grew in the 19th to be one of the main industries of the village. The distance to the nearest train station, &lt;a href=\"Dottikon\"&gt;Dottikon&lt;/a&gt;, delayed industrial development of H\u00e4gglingen. By 2003, a number of medium and small businesses, primarily in the &lt;a href=\"plastics%20industry\"&gt;plastics industry&lt;/a&gt;, offered approximately 520 jobs.\nGeography.\nH\u00e4gglingen has an area, , of .
