    "text": "Gilbert's potoroo or ngilkat (\"Potorous gilbertii\") is Australia's most endangered &lt;a href=\"marsupial\"&gt;marsupial&lt;/a&gt; and one of the world's rarest &lt;a href=\"critically%20endangered\"&gt;critically endangered&lt;/a&gt; mammals. It is a small nocturnal &lt;a href=\"Macropodidae\"&gt;macropod&lt;/a&gt; that lives in small groups. It has long hind feet and front feet with curved claws, which it uses to dig for food. Its body has large amounts of fur, which helps with insulation, and its fur ranges between brown and grey, the colour fading on its belly. This potoroo has a long, thin snout curving downward that it uses to smell its surroundings; this trait is common in all potoroo species. Its eyes appear to bulge out of its face and look as though they are on an angle, and its ears are almost invisible, buried under thick fur. Male and female body types are similar and are both within the same size range. Adult females range in weight from 708\u20131205\u00a0g (including pouch young where present), whereas adult males range in weight from 845\u20131200\u00a0g.\nThe current estimated population is a sparse 70 individuals. It was thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1994. The only naturally located population is found in &lt;a href=\"Two%20Peoples%20Bay%20Nature%20Reserve\"&gt;Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, where they co-exist with quokkas (\"&lt;a href=\"Setonix%20brachyurus\"&gt;Setonix brachyurus&lt;/a&gt;\"). Small populations are also being established at &lt;a href=\"Bald%20Island\"&gt;Bald Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michaelmas%20Island\"&gt;Michaelmas Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaxonomy.\nA description of the species was published by &lt;a href=\"John%20Gould\"&gt;John Gould&lt;/a&gt; in his \"Monograph of Macropodidae\" (1841), which included an illustration of the species by &lt;a href=\"H.%20C.%20Richter\"&gt;H. C. Richter&lt;/a&gt;. The name was published in the \"Proceedings\" of the &lt;a href=\"Zoological%20Society%20of%20London\"&gt;Zoological Society of London&lt;/a&gt;, reporting Gould's presentation of the specimen at its meeting on 9 February 1841.\nGould placed the new species with the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Hypsiprymnus\"&gt;Hypsiprymnus&lt;/a&gt;\", and the taxon was later assigned to the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Potorous\"&gt;Potorous&lt;/a&gt;\".\nA specimen of the animal was collected by the field worker &lt;a href=\"John%20Gilbert%20%28naturalist%29\"&gt;John Gilbert&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"King%20George%20Sound\"&gt;King George Sound&lt;/a&gt;, while collecting birds and mammals for Gould at the new colonies in the southwest of Australia. The &lt;a href=\"holotype\"&gt;holotype&lt;/a&gt; is a female skin and skull placed at the &lt;a href=\"British%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History\"&gt;British Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;, a specimen that was also named as \"Hypsiprymnus micropus\" &lt;a href=\"G.%20R.%20Waterhouse\"&gt;G. R. Waterhouse&lt;/a&gt; 1841.\nGould's description was later submerged as a subspecies or recognised as a synonym of other potoroine taxa, and was referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Potorous%20tridactylus\"&gt;Potorous tridactylus&lt;/a&gt;\" in taxonomic and conservation listings. Until the rediscovery of the species, the material available limited any comparison with its related taxa. An analysis of the new material and revision of the genus \"Potorous\" confirmed what Gilbert had supposed when he collected the first specimen, and the taxon was again recognised as a species.\nThe specific epithet was nominated by Gould to recognise John Gilbert and suggested the trivial name of Gilbert's rat kangaroo. Gould also provides the name used at King George Sound, given as \"grul-gyte\". A review of historical records for the names in the Nyungar language proposed the adoption of ngilkat [ngil'kat] as the regular spelling of its preferred common name.\nDescription.\nA small species of \"&lt;a href=\"Potorous\"&gt;Potorous&lt;/a&gt;\" with a fur colour that is rufous brown across the upper side and light grey beneath.\nThe length of the head and body combined is 270 to 290 mm, the average is 250\u00a0mm, and is proportionately less than the length of the tail, which is from 215 to 230\u00a0mm and averages 223 mm.\nThe measurement of the hind foot is 65 to 70\u00a0mm and proportionally less than the length of the head.\nTheir short ears are covered in greyish fur and rounded in their profile, the fur is also grey over the muzzle.\nThe recorded weight range of the species is 785 to 965 g. The tail of \"P. gilbertii\" tapers away from the body and is covered with only a small amount of hair.\nDistribution and habitat.\nGilbert's potoroo was once found in a large distribution range across south-west Australia, but seems to have been locally restricted.\nSites at &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Naturaliste\"&gt;Cape Naturaliste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Leeuwin\"&gt;Cape Leeuwin&lt;/a&gt; have produced sub-fossil remains that show the range extended to the west of the King George Sound region at some point in recent history.\nThe physical and anecdotal ranges included the areas around King George Sound and near the Margaret River, but the native range became reduced to the Mount Gardner headland at Two Peoples Bay. \nWithin that area of less than 1,000 hectares, the species occupies four separate areas of dense shrubland within valleys on the mount's slopes; Mount Gardner provides a habitat that has been isolated from changed fire regimes. \nThese areas are described as a \"&lt;a href=\"Melaleuca%20striata\"&gt;Melaleuca striata&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Melaleuca%20uncinata\"&gt;Melaleuca uncinata&lt;/a&gt;\" shrubland, between 1.5 and 2.0\u00a0m tall with 70-100% canopy cover, and a dense layer of sedges including \"&lt;a href=\"Lepidosperma\"&gt;Lepidosperma&lt;/a&gt;\" sp. and \"&lt;a href=\"Anarthria%20scabra\"&gt;Anarthria scabra&lt;/a&gt;\" as the understorey. \nThe vegetation forming its habitat has not been burnt for over 50 years, so that long unburnt areas are thought to be necessary for the species.\nThe foraging activity of Gilbert's potoroo is &lt;a href=\"Nocturnality\"&gt;nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;; it remains hidden in dense undergrowth during the day, and rarely crosses large open areas.\nDiet.\nStudy of the species diet is limited to the relict population discovered at Two Peoples Bay, and is found to be similar to that of \"P. tridactylus\".\nGilbert's potoroo is primarily mycophagous, a diet that consists of multiple species of &lt;a href=\"truffle\"&gt;truffle&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;. It may also consume fleshy fruits, as seeds have been found in the scat, but how important this is to its diet is unknown. Australia has the majority of fungal varieties, and Gilbert's potoroo eats a variety of them. From translocation of the potoroo, the species was found to survive on many different kinds of fungi, not limited to the species available in its habitat at Two People's Bay.\nAs with many of the potoroine species, the primary type of fungus consumed is hypogeous, with the above-ground fruiting bodies of epigeous fungi forming only a minor part of their diet. Plant matter consumed includes leaves and stems, and invertebrates have also been recorded in the excreta; this has been regarded as incidental ingestion while eating subterranean fungi.\nAbout 90% of the volume of material consumed is hypogeous fungus.\nThe spores of five fungal species have been recorded in faecal matter throughout the year; the total number is around 40 species.\nGilbert's potoroo has sharp, three-toed claws that help it dig into the ground to unearth fungi. After digestion, the potoroo aids in spore distribution, as the &lt;a href=\"spores\"&gt;spores&lt;/a&gt; germinate from its &lt;a href=\"feces\"&gt;feces&lt;/a&gt;.\nReproduction.\nA female Gilbert's potoroo can have two babies in a year, while carrying only one at a time. It has the ability to keep a second embryo in a state of &lt;a href=\"diapause\"&gt;diapause&lt;/a&gt; while the first embryo is growing. If the first baby does not go to term, the second baby starts growing right away. The &lt;a href=\"gestation\"&gt;gestation&lt;/a&gt; period for this species is unknown, but is estimated to be similar to the &lt;a href=\"Potorous%20tridactylus\"&gt;long-nosed potoroo&lt;/a&gt; at 38 days. Since so few are alive today, much of the reproductive cycle for Gilbert's potoroo remains unknown. The main breeding period is thought to be November\u2013December, with similar breeding patterns to those of the long-nosed potoroo. Scientists have tried to breed them in captivity, but recent attempts have been unsuccessful, citing diet, incompatibility, and age as possible factors that influenced the lack of reproduction. Reproduction in the wild is thought to be progressing successfully, as many females found in the wild are with young.\nRediscovery.\nAfter the collection of the first specimen in 1840, when Gilbert had reported to Gould that the species was locally common, the success of field workers in finding the animal was little and then none until the rediscovery in the late 20th century. Gould's description gives a report by Gilbert that the local Nyungar people caught them in \"immense numbers\" on a single hunt. A letter of &lt;a href=\"James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29\"&gt;James Drummond&lt;/a&gt; notes a series of specimens assembled by his son, around a dozen from an unspecified location. &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Krefft\"&gt;Gerard Krefft&lt;/a&gt; also noted that &lt;a href=\"George%20Masters\"&gt;George Masters&lt;/a&gt;, a highly active collector of the Albany district, obtained around five to eight specimens in 1866 and a pair in 1869. Later workers known to have made extensive collections in the area, including &lt;a href=\"G.%20C.%20Shortridge\"&gt;Shortridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Tunney%20%28naturalist%29\"&gt;John Tunney&lt;/a&gt;, failed to record this species in the southern districts by the end of the 19th century.\nThe few known historical records of the potoroo are all at the southwestern coast of &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20Australia%20%28ecoregion%29\"&gt;Southwest Australia&lt;/a&gt;, summarised as those around King George Sound during 1843, 1866, 1869, and 1875, and the uncertain date of 1890s to the west.\nThe species was presumed to be &lt;a href=\"extinct\"&gt;extinct&lt;/a&gt; for 20 years before it was rediscovered in 1994 in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Liz Sinclair had been doing research on &lt;a href=\"Wallaby\"&gt;wallabies&lt;/a&gt;, and caught the potoroo in one of her traps. She then compared her captured specimen with the skeletons of past potoroos, and proved it was indeed a Gilbert's potoroo.\nNo other known wild population has been found after the rediscovery at Two Peoples Bay. The size of the population places the potoroo on the edge of extinction, and the fate and trajectory of the species is considered precarious.\nPopulation.\nPotoroos were Australia's most endangered mammal. After the rediscovery of Gilbert's potoroo, additional specimens were immediately taken into captivity to try to help to promote more young to be born to help increase the population. A few young were born in the first few years, but then breeding stopped due to age differences and a history of &lt;a href=\"balanoposthitis\"&gt;balanoposthitis&lt;/a&gt;, a disease that affects &lt;a href=\"marsupial%20penis\"&gt;the male potoroo's penis&lt;/a&gt; and causes inflammation and ulceration if left untreated. This problem exists among the wild population; captive males are treated with antibiotics. \nIn 2001, the Gilbert's Potoroo Action Group was formed to help in the education and public awareness of the potoroos. The group also helps with raising funds for their research and captive-breeding programs.\nIn efforts to protect the remaining population, three Gilbert's potoroos (one male and two females) were moved to &lt;a href=\"Bald%20Island\"&gt;Bald Island&lt;/a&gt; in August 2005, where they are free from predation. Since that time, an additional four potoroos have been sent to establish a breeding colony.\nAlong with the dwindling number of the species after their rediscovery in Australia, one of the potoroos was found to have some sort of sickness when brought into captivity in early 2000. The scientists who had brought the young male potoroo and its mother into captivity found that the animal had significant loss of appetite, and lost 32% of its body mass within a few weeks. They had observed it moving in circles in captivity and behaving in an odd manner. They had also noticed symptoms of sporadic coughing fits and before its death had seen that the potoroo had actually gone into a state of hypothermia. In a later study of a long-nosed potoroo, the same symptoms were found and were likened to a fatal disease, &lt;a href=\"cryptococcosis\"&gt;cryptococcosis&lt;/a&gt;, which had been contracted while the animals were in the wild. This could also be a factor why the potoroo population is dwindling in the wild, because the disease could be killing the young before they are able to reproduce.\nA thesis published in 2008 considered the diseases that may affect individuals of \"P. gilbertii\" and the remaining population. Some conditions detected in the hosts were associated with novel species of internal and external organisms.\nIn 2016, &lt;a href=\"Michaelmas%20Island\"&gt;Michaelmas Island&lt;/a&gt;, off the coast of Two Peoples Bay, was chosen as a new habitat location. The island's lack of predators was a key factor in its selection, which will provide Gilbert's potoroo with a similar level of long-term protection enjoyed by the &lt;a href=\"quokkas\"&gt;quokkas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rottnest%20Island\"&gt;Rottnest Island&lt;/a&gt;, also in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nGilbert's potoroo was one of first species noticed as disappearing after British colonisation, and remarkable in its rediscovery at the end of the 20th century. The &lt;a href=\"relict%20%28biology%29\"&gt;relict&lt;/a&gt; population at Two Peoples Bay, around 40 individuals, had survived the factors that caused the mass decline of Australian mammals in a critical weight range of species smaller and larger than themselves. The earliest records of the species are found in the letters and field notes of John Gilbert, repeated by Gould and later authors, as the only source of information on the living species.\nJohn Gould published the existing name in the &lt;a href=\"Nyungar%20language\"&gt;Nyungar language&lt;/a&gt; as \"\"grul-gyte\" (1841) and later \"ngil-gyte\"\" (1863), the second name matching Gilbert's own field notes as the name reported to him at King George Sound. A similar name was given in various other ways in the early wordlists of &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Scott%20Nind\"&gt;Isaac Scott Nind&lt;/a&gt; (\"nailoit\") and &lt;a href=\"George%20Fletcher%20Moore\"&gt;George Fletcher Moore&lt;/a&gt; (\"garlgyte') as and others, and rendered as \"ngilkat\" in an ethnohistoric review published in 2001.\nThe author proposed the species name \"Hypsiprymnus gilbertii\" with an explanation in \"A Monograph of the Macropodidae, or Family of Kangaroos\", "
