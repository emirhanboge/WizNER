    "text": "N\u00eemes Olympique (commonly referred to as simply N\u00eemes) is a &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20France\"&gt;French association football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"N%C3%AEmes\"&gt;N\u00eemes&lt;/a&gt;. The club was founded on 10 April 1937 and currently plays in &lt;a href=\"Ligue%202\"&gt;Ligue 2&lt;/a&gt;, the second level of &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20France\"&gt;French football&lt;/a&gt;. The club's most important achievements were winning Ligue 2 in 1950 and the &lt;a href=\"Championnat%20National\"&gt;Championnat National&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 and in 2012. N\u00eemes plays its home matches at the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20des%20Costi%C3%A8res\"&gt;Stade des Costi\u00e8res&lt;/a&gt; located within the city.\nHistory.\nThe Sporting Club N\u00eemois (SCN) was founded in 1901 by Henri Monnier, who, at the age of 21, had just returned from a two-year trip to England. He decided to start a new team in &lt;a href=\"N%C3%AEmes\"&gt;N\u00eemes&lt;/a&gt;, his home town. Originally, the team was for young Protestants only.\nIn 1908, the SCN played &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20Cettois\"&gt;FC S\u00e8te&lt;/a&gt; for the title of 'Champions of &lt;a href=\"Languedoc\"&gt;Languedoc&lt;/a&gt;'. N\u00eemes won, qualifying for the final phase of the French championship, which they lost to &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20de%20Marseille\"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt; in the first round.\nThe club suspended activities due to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. After the war ended, it resumed its activities on 15 April 1919. In 1922, SCN united with another club from N\u00eemes, F.A. N\u00eemois, becoming a single club.\nThe new team, still under the name of Sporting Club N\u00eemois, was runner-up in the South-East championship in 1925. In 1927, \"les N\u00eemois\" won a place in the highest championship, then known as the Division d'Honneur.\nIn October 1931, the then-president of the Republic of France, &lt;a href=\"Gaston%20Doumergue\"&gt;Gaston Doumergue&lt;/a&gt;, inaugurated the Jean Bouin stadium.\nDue to financial problems, SCN abandoned their professional activities in 1937. Following efforts from local businessmen, the club moved to the district of Loz\u00e8re-Gard in N\u00eemes, and was reformed as N\u00eemes Olympique.\nThe team moved to the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20des%20Costi%C3%A8res\"&gt;Stade des Costi\u00e8res&lt;/a&gt; on 15 February 1989. The first league match at the stadium was on 4 March 1989, against Montceau in a &lt;a href=\"Ligue%202\"&gt;Ligue 2&lt;/a&gt; game, with 3,647 spectators in attendance. The record attendance to date was 25,051, which was recorded in the 1991\u201392 season, in a &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;Ligue 1&lt;/a&gt; game against &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20de%20Marseille\"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt;. In December 1991, during a match for N\u00eemes, &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Cantona\"&gt;Eric Cantona&lt;/a&gt; threw the ball at the referee, having been angered by one of his decisions. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the French Football Federation and was banned for one month. In turn, Cantona responded by walking up to each member of the hearing committee and calling them idiots. His ban was increased to two months, and Cantona subsequently announced his retirement from international football on 16 December 1991.\nIn 1995\u201396, N\u00eemes reached the final of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Cup\"&gt;French Cup&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to compete the following year in the &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In September 1996, in the Round of 32, N\u00eemes beat &lt;a href=\"Budapest%20Honv%C3%A9d%20FC\"&gt;Budapest Honv\u00e9d&lt;/a&gt; (4\u20131 on aggregate), before losing to &lt;a href=\"AIK%20Stockholm\"&gt;AIK Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; in the next round (2-3 on aggregate).\nOn 5 May 2018, Nimes secured promotion back to Ligue 1 for the first time since the 1992\u201393 season after finishing second in Ligue 2. In the 2018\u201319 season, Nimes enjoyed a happy return to Ligue 1 finishing 9th on the table. In the shortened 2019\u201320 season, the team finished 18th and narrowly avoided relegation.\nOn 16 May 2021, following a 5\u20132 home defeat against &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20Lyonnais\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; and a 4\u20130 away win for &lt;a href=\"Football%20Club%20de%20Nantes%20Atlantique\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt; at already relegated &lt;a href=\"Dijon%20FCO\"&gt;Dijon&lt;/a&gt; in matchday 37 out of 38, N\u00eemes confirmed its own relegation from Ligue 1 during the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Ligue%201\"&gt;2020\u201321 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub identity.\nThe largest group of &lt;a href=\"Ultras\"&gt;Ultras&lt;/a&gt; are the Gladiators N\u00eemes founded in 1991. The name refers to N\u00eemes' rich history, dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the start of each home game, an extract of &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Bizet\"&gt;Georges Bizet&lt;/a&gt;'s opera \"&lt;a href=\"Carmen\"&gt;Carmen&lt;/a&gt;\" is heard.\nThere is a long rivalry with the nearby city of &lt;a href=\"Montpellier\"&gt;Montpellier&lt;/a&gt; which extends to both local football teams. &lt;a href=\"Montpellier%20HSC\"&gt;Montpellier HSC&lt;/a&gt; are N\u00eemes Olympique's rivals.\nPlayers.\nNotable players.\nBelow are the notable former players who have represented N\u00eemes in &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; and international competition since the club's foundation in 1937.
