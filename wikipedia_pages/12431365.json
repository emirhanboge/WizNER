The source of the river lies to the southwest of the Serra do Caldeir\u00e3o mountain ridge, in a valley called Barranco do P\u00e9 do Coelho. The river has a total length of , with its source being above sea level. The mouth of the river empties into the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; between the city of Portim\u00e3o and the &lt;a href=\"freguesia\"&gt;freguesia&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ferragudo\"&gt;Ferragudo&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Lagoa%20Municipality%20%28Algarve%29\"&gt;Lagoa Municipality&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the time of the Moors until the 19th century, the Arade was navigable up to as far as Silves about , where an important &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; used to exist, especially for the &lt;a href=\"Cork%20%28material%29\"&gt;cork&lt;/a&gt; trade. Nowadays only small boats can go that far.\nDams.\nPart of the reason for the present low water flow (and subsequent silting up) of the river has been the erection of two dams in the middle reaches of the river\u2014the Barragem (Dam) de Arade and above it the Barragem do Funcho."
