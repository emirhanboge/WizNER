The ride was the world's second 4th Dimension coaster. Eejanaika is taller, faster, and longer than its predecessor, &lt;a href=\"X2%20%28roller%20coaster%29\"&gt;X2&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Six%20Flags%20Magic%20Mountain\"&gt;Six Flags Magic Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe roller coaster, designed by &lt;a href=\"S%26amp%3BS%20Arrow\"&gt;S&amp;S Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, is a \"4th Dimension\" coaster, a design in which the seats can rotate forward or backward 360 degrees in a controlled spin. This is achieved by having four rails on the track: two of these are running rails while the other two are for spin control. The two rails that control the spin of the seats move up and down relative to the track and spin the seats using a &lt;a href=\"rack%20and%20pinion\"&gt;rack and pinion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gear\"&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt; mechanism.\nEejanaika has the second \"\u3048\" turned upside down for the roller coaster's official spelling. Eejanaika has several meanings, but means \"Ain't it great!\" According to the &lt;a href=\"Guinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records\"&gt;Guinness Book of World Records&lt;/a&gt;, Eejanaika is the roller coaster with the most &lt;a href=\"roller%20coaster%20inversions\"&gt;inversion&lt;/a&gt;s in the world with 14, although &lt;a href=\"The%20Smiler%20%28roller%20coaster%29\"&gt;The Smiler&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Alton%20Towers\"&gt;Alton Towers&lt;/a&gt; has 14 inversions also. However, most of these inversions are accomplished by spinning the seats rather than actually inverting the track. it is also considered a wing coaster.\nThe track itself only inverts three times \u2013 \nThis has led to some controversy in the roller coaster enthusiast community concerning the legitimacy of \"Eejanaika's\" claim. The &lt;a href=\"Roller%20Coaster%20DataBase\"&gt;Roller Coaster DataBase&lt;/a&gt; does not acknowledge these seat inversions for the purpose of record-holding."
