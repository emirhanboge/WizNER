    "text": "The Total U-20 Africa Cup of Nations (previously known as the African Youth Championship or the African U-20 Championship) is the main international youth &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; competition for &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20African%20Football\"&gt;CAF&lt;/a&gt; nations, and is competed for by under 20 year olds. It is held every two years with the top 4 teams qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20U-20%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA U-20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1979 until 1989, the African representatives were determined purely on a home and away qualifying basis without a final tournament, with the African champions determined through the same qualification. Since 1991 there has been a qualifying stage followed by a final tournament played by 8 teams in a chosen country.\nOn 6 August 2015, the CAF Executive Committee decided to change the name of the tournament from the African Youth Championship to the U-20 Africa Cup of Nations, similar to the senior's version, &lt;a href=\"Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Africa Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn July 2016, &lt;a href=\"Total%20S.A.\"&gt;Total&lt;/a&gt; has secured an eight-year sponsorship package from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to support 10 of its principal competitions, including the U-20 Africa Cup of Nations Champions League, renamed Total U-20 Africa Cup of Nations.\nPerformance by nation.\nSource for winners and runners-up: RSSSF\nParticipating nations by year of debut.\nParticipating nations by Debut (Until 1989, counted Round 1, after 1991 counting Final 16)"
