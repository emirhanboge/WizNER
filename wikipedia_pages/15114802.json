    "text": "Sheaf House is a former home ground of &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.\"&gt;The Wednesday Football Club&lt;/a&gt; and was located near the centre of &lt;a href=\"Sheffield\"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Yorkshire\"&gt;South Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The club started to use the ground after leaving &lt;a href=\"Myrtle%20Road\"&gt;Myrtle Road&lt;/a&gt; in 1877 and it remained their main 'home' ground until 1880. At that point most home matches switched to &lt;a href=\"Bramall%20Lane\"&gt;Bramall Lane&lt;/a&gt;, however Wednesday continued to play some games at Sheaf House until &lt;a href=\"Olive%20Grove\"&gt;Olive Grove&lt;/a&gt; was opened in 1887.\nSheaf House was less suitable for hosting &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches than Bramall Lane (which was situated very close to the ground) but it was apparently cheaper to rent.\nThe ground has since been covered by a new development, however the Sheaf House &lt;a href=\"public%20house\"&gt;pub&lt;/a&gt; which used to stand at the corner of the ground is still there."
