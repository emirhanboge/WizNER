During the 1885 &lt;a href=\"North-West%20Rebellion\"&gt;North-West Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; he led the first medical corps to &lt;a href=\"Saskatoon%2C%20Saskatchewan\"&gt;Saskatoon&lt;/a&gt;. After the rebellion he worked as a farmer, before opening a general store in Saskatoon in 1896.\nIn January 1903 he was elected overseer over the village of Saskatoon, and when on July 1 of that year the village was incorporated as a town, he became its first mayor. He served until 1904, and again later as mayor of the by now city of Saskatoon from 1907-1908. He also sat on the city council from 1914-1919.\nIn his times as mayor he personally guaranteed a bank loan that allowed for the completion of sewer, water and electrical works, and it was also whilst he was mayor that Saskatoon's City Park was purchased.\nWilson also tried his hand at national politics, standing unsuccessfully as a federal candidate for the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada%20%28historical%29\"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; in 1908, before managing to be elected in 1917. He served for four years, including a spell as a &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Canada\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; minister, before being defeated in 1921.\nHis brother &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Wilson%20%28Canadian%20politician%29\"&gt;Russell&lt;/a&gt; also served as mayor of Saskatoon."
