    "text": "Ferdinand Gottlob Schichau (30 January 1814 \u2013 23 January 1896) was a German &lt;a href=\"mechanical%20engineer\"&gt;mechanical engineer&lt;/a&gt; and businessman.\nSchichau was born in &lt;a href=\"Elbl%C4%85g\"&gt;Elbing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Prussia\"&gt;West Prussia&lt;/a&gt; (modern Elbl\u0105g, &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;) to a &lt;a href=\"Smith%20%28metalwork%29\"&gt;smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron%20worker\"&gt;iron worker&lt;/a&gt;. He studied engineering in Berlin and visited the &lt;a href=\"Rhineland\"&gt;Rhineland&lt;/a&gt; and England. In 1837 he started his own &lt;a href=\"company%20%28law%29\"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; in Elbing. He also built a shipyard in &lt;a href=\"Pillau\"&gt;Pillau&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6nigsberg\"&gt;K\u00f6nigsberg&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"East%20Prussia\"&gt;East Prussia&lt;/a&gt;) (today &lt;a href=\"Baltiysk\"&gt;Baltiysk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaliningrad%20Oblast\"&gt;Kaliningrad Oblast&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Schichau-Werke\"&gt;Schichau-Werke&lt;/a&gt;\" became a large &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20sector\"&gt;industrial&lt;/a&gt; complex, which employed several thousand &lt;a href=\"person\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;. Schichau made &lt;a href=\"hydraulic%20press\"&gt;hydraulic press&lt;/a&gt;es, industrial machines and &lt;a href=\"steam%20engine\"&gt;steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s. For his &lt;a href=\"worker\"&gt;worker&lt;/a&gt;s he erected a large living quarter section in Elbing. The \"&lt;a href=\"Borussia%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Borussia&lt;/a&gt;\", constructed by him, was the first &lt;a href=\"Steamboat\"&gt;screw-vessel&lt;/a&gt; in Germany.\nSchichau gained an associate when his daughter married around 1873 &lt;a href=\"Carl%20H.%20Ziese\"&gt;Carl H. Ziese&lt;/a&gt; (1848 -1917) the constructor in 1874 of the first &lt;a href=\"compound%20steam%20engine\"&gt;compound steam engine&lt;/a&gt; to be integrated in a German &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe company had so many orders that it became necessary to construct another large shipyard in nearby &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Danzig (Gda\u0144sk)&lt;/a&gt; as well. In 1896 Schichau employed about 4,000 labourers his private assets were appraised at 30 million &lt;a href=\"German%20gold%20mark\"&gt;German gold mark&lt;/a&gt;. Schichau died in Elbing on 23 January 1896, his son in law (Ziese) continued to lead the company till his own death in 1917. Ziese's only daughter, Hildegard, married Swedish Engineer Carl Carlson.\nAfter her husband's death, Hildegard Carlson ran the former firm of her father Carl and grand father Ferdinand building, mainly, railway engines till the thereafters of a company active till no less than 1945.\nWhen Elbing and Danzig were transferred to Poland after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Schichau's memory all but disappeared. The street in Elbing named after him (\"Schichaustra\u00dfe\") was renamed \"ul. Stoczniowa\", and his statue was destroyed. His contributions only recently became known in Poland at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;.\nSchichau's name remains in the &lt;a href=\"Schichau%20Seebeckwerft\"&gt;Schichau Seebeck Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Bremerhaven\"&gt;Bremerhaven&lt;/a&gt;."
