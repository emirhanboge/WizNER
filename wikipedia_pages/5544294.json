    "text": "Olaf Lindenbergh (born 6 February 1974 in &lt;a href=\"Purmerend\"&gt;Purmerend&lt;/a&gt;) is a former Dutch &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;er, who currently played for club &lt;a href=\"ASV%20De%20Dijk\"&gt;ASV De Dijk&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nAfter playing in the youth level at ZOB, &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"De%20Graafschap\"&gt;De Graafschap&lt;/a&gt;, Lindenbergh began his professional career at De Graafschap that played in the &lt;a href=\"Eerste%20Divisie\"&gt;Eerste Divisie&lt;/a&gt;. His debut was on 12 November 1994 in a 1\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"VVV-Venlo\"&gt;VVV&lt;/a&gt;. He became a key player for the team straight away and helped them to gain promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Eredivisie\"&gt;Eredivisie&lt;/a&gt; for the following season, in which he made 30 appearances. In total he took part in 159 games for De Graafschap, scoring six goals, with the club permanently in the top flight. During the 1999\u201300 season, he left &lt;a href=\"De%20Vijverberg\"&gt;De Vijverberg&lt;/a&gt; to continue his career at &lt;a href=\"AZ%20Alkmaar\"&gt;AZ Alkmaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt AZ, Lindenbergh was a first team regular from the start, but he struggled to gain appearances in his second season at the club. As of 2001 he was back on track and became one of the key players of the team unexpectedly made it to the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-finals in 2005, only to be beaten on away goals by &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Sporting Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;. Ajax manager &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Blind\"&gt;Danny Blind&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged Lindenbergh's good form and declared an interest in signing him. At the end of the 2004/05 season, Lindenbergh agreed to a move to the &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam%20ArenA\"&gt;Amsterdam ArenA&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe made his debut for the club in 2005 in the 2\u20130 Eredivisie victory against &lt;a href=\"Willem%20II%20Tilburg\"&gt;Willem II&lt;/a&gt;. He went on to play eighteen games that season, as well as gaining some &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; experience along the way. Ajax went on to win the &lt;a href=\"KNVB%20Cup\"&gt;KNVB Cup&lt;/a&gt; that same season. When Blind left Ajax and &lt;a href=\"Henk%20ten%20Cate\"&gt;Henk ten Cate&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as the new manager, times changed for Lindenbergh and he only appeared in 12 matches that season. Still he participated in the KNVB Cup, which Ajax successfully defended. Following speculation about a transfer (Lindenbergh, along with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Krohn-Dehli\"&gt;Michael Krohn-Dehli&lt;/a&gt; were deemed surplus to requirements, and were not even allowed to train with the first team to keep their fitness up), Lindenbergh signed with &lt;a href=\"Sparta%20Rotterdam\"&gt;Sparta Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nWhile at De Graafschap, Lindenbergh was called up into the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20under-21%20football%20team\"&gt;Holland-under-21&lt;/a&gt; squad."
