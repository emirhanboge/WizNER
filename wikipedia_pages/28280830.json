    "text": "Cr\u00eapes &amp; Waffles is a Colombian restaurant chain. The idea was born from a couple of Los Andes university students project, who had the vision to open a business in which they believed. Cr\u00eapes &amp; Waffles originally catered to the upper class, but within the past few years, the prices have decreased, making it more affordable than other similar restaurants. The combination of high quality and low-price meals was a factor leading to its commercial success.\nHistory.\nFounded on April the 13 of 1980, two students of CESA university, opened their first restaurant in &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; in the style of a small rustic French cr\u00eaperie. The restaurant was so simple that even the menu was made of a piece of wood that contained the different types of cr\u00eapes, waffles and ice creams. \nDuring the past few years the chain has been so successful that now it has restaurants in &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, and many other countries. The last international restaurant that opened was inaugurated in &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.Also the chain stop selling franchises.\nIn Colombia it's also well known for only hiring single women and \"women in need\" because responsibility, and also does this in &lt;a href=\"Quito\"&gt;Quito&lt;/a&gt;.\nA project to export Cr\u00eapes and Waffles to France, Italy, and Portugal has been halted for the time being."
