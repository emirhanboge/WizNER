Yeldon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Daphne%20High%20School\"&gt;Daphne&lt;/a&gt; team in the first round of the playoffs. Still, Mosley earned his second consecutive ASWA 6A All-State honors, as well as Class 6A Lineman of the Year. He finished his career at Theodore as the school's all-time leading tackler, with over 500 stops in his career.\nIn addition, Mosley was on the school's &lt;a href=\"track%20%26amp%3B%20field\"&gt;track &amp; field&lt;/a&gt; team. He ran the &lt;a href=\"110%20metres%20hurdles\"&gt;110m hurdles&lt;/a&gt; in 16.15 seconds and the &lt;a href=\"200%20meters\"&gt;200m dash&lt;/a&gt; in 24.33 seconds.

He was also the second-ranked player from Alabama, behind fellow Crimson Tide recruit &lt;a href=\"Dee%20Milliner\"&gt;Dee Milliner&lt;/a&gt;. Mosley played in the 2010 &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Army%20All-American%20Bowl\"&gt;U.S. Army All-American Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, where he committed to Alabama during the game. He chose the Crimson Tide over &lt;a href=\"Auburn%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Auburn&lt;/a&gt;, but also had offers from &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20Volunteers%20football\"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, among others.\nCollege career.\nFreshman year (2010).\nMosley was a consensus Freshman All-American in 2010 for the Crimson Tide, selected by the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Writers%20Association%20of%20America\"&gt;FWAA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rivals.com\"&gt;Rivals.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20News\"&gt;College Football News&lt;/a&gt; after playing in all 13 games as a true &lt;a href=\"Freshman%23United%20States\"&gt;freshman&lt;/a&gt;.\nSophomore year (2011).\nMosley dislocated his right elbow in the first quarter of the fourth game of the 2011 season against &lt;a href=\"2011%20Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20football%20team\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;. He missed the following two games against &lt;a href=\"2011%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2011%20Vanderbilt%20Commodores%20football%20team\"&gt;Vanderbilt&lt;/a&gt; and did not record a tackle in the next game against &lt;a href=\"2011%20Ole%20Miss%20Rebels%20football%20team\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;. Mosley shared the starting weak-side inside linebacker (\"Will\") linebacker spot with &lt;a href=\"Nico%20Johnson\"&gt;Nico Johnson&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 and 2012, with Alabama coaches using Mosley more in pass coverage.\nJunior year (2012).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; recognized Mosley as a first team All-American after the 2012 regular season, a year after former teammate linebacker &lt;a href=\"Dont%27a%20Hightower\"&gt;Dont'a Hightower&lt;/a&gt; made the AP All-American first team and other linebacker teammate &lt;a href=\"Courtney%20Upshaw\"&gt;Courtney Upshaw&lt;/a&gt; made the second team. With Mosley's selection to the AP All-American team in 2012, Alabama had a linebacker on that team (first through third teams) for four of the previous five years. Mosley led the team in tackles in 2012 with 107; sophomore &lt;a href=\"Trey%20DePriest\"&gt;Trey DePriest&lt;/a&gt; was second with 59 tackles. Mosley finished third for the 2012 Butkus Award (goes to the country's best linebacker) behind Notre Dame linebacker &lt;a href=\"Manti%20Te%27o\"&gt;Manti Te'o&lt;/a&gt; and Georgia linebacker &lt;a href=\"Jarvis%20Jones\"&gt;Jarvis Jones&lt;/a&gt;. Mosley earned Alabama's MVP award in 2012. Mosley's three career interception returns for touchdowns tied an Alabama record. Mosley indicated in December 2012 that he will return to Alabama for his &lt;a href=\"2013%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;senior season&lt;/a&gt;.\nSenior year (2013).\nMosley led the Alabama football team in tackles (108) for the second consecutive year, averaging the most tackles-per-game in his college career. In November 2013, Mosley was a semifinalist for the Lombardi, Bednarik and Butkus Awards. While the Missouri Tigers's Michael Sam is often remembered as the 2013 SEC Defensive Player of the Year, he and Mosley actually shared the award.\nMosley was again named as a first-team All-&lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Conference\"&gt;Southeastern Conference&lt;/a&gt; (SEC) selection. He was also selected to the First Team of the Associated Press' All-America Team.\nProfessional career.\nPrior to the NFL Combine, Mosley underwent surgery to repair a labrum issue after dislocating his hip. He attended the NFL Scouting Combine in &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis\"&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/a&gt;, but was not able to participate in running drills as he was still recovering. Mosley completed the vertical jump, short shuttle, three-cone drill, and broad jump at the combine.\nOn March 12, 2014, Mosley participated at Alabama's pro day and performed the 40-yard dash (4.63s), 20-yard dash (2.70s), 10-yard dash (1.56s), and bench press (15). Multiple NFL scouts and team representatives attended Alabama's pro day, including head coaches &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Payton\"&gt;Sean Payton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%20Saints\"&gt;(Saints)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Lewis\"&gt;Marvin Lewis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Bengals\"&gt;(Bengals)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chip%20Kelly\"&gt;Chip Kelly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Eagles\"&gt;(Eagles)&lt;/a&gt;. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Mosley was projected to be a first round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was regarded as a top 15 pick, but fell in some first round projections due to his lengthy injury history. Mosley attended pre-draft visits and private workouts for multiple teams, but received the most interest from the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Bills\"&gt;Buffalo Bills&lt;/a&gt; and Baltimore Ravens.\nBaltimore Ravens.\n2014.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Ravens\"&gt;Baltimore Ravens&lt;/a&gt; selected Mosley in the first round (17th overall) of the &lt;a href=\"2014%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2014 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;. Mosley was the fourth linebacker drafted in 2014 and became the highest linebacker drafted from Alabama since &lt;a href=\"Rolando%20McClain\"&gt;Rolando McClain&lt;/a&gt; went eighth overall in &lt;a href=\"2010%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, he was one of eight Alabama Crimson Tide players to be selected that year.\nOn May 27, 2014, the Baltimore Ravens signed Mosley to a four-year, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20dollar\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;8.87 million contract that includes a &lt;a href=\"signing%20bonus\"&gt;signing bonus&lt;/a&gt; of $4.71 million.\nMosley was assigned the No. 57, which was worn by former Baltimore Raven &lt;a href=\"O.%20J.%20Brigance\"&gt;O. J. Brigance&lt;/a&gt;. The No. 57 had been unofficially retired after Brigance was diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"Amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis\"&gt;ALS&lt;/a&gt;. No. 57 was also worn by &lt;a href=\"Bart%20Scott\"&gt;Bart Scott&lt;/a&gt; (who was assigned the number before O.J. Brigance's diagnosis). Head coach &lt;a href=\"John%20Harbaugh\"&gt;John Harbaugh&lt;/a&gt; named Mosley and &lt;a href=\"Daryl%20Smith%20%28linebacker%29\"&gt;Daryl Smith&lt;/a&gt; the starting inside linebackers to begin the regular season, alongside outside linebackers &lt;a href=\"Courtney%20Upshaw\"&gt;Courtney Upshaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terrell%20Suggs\"&gt;Terrell Suggs&lt;/a&gt;. Mosley was the first rookie to start on the Ravens' defense since &lt;a href=\"Haloti%20Ngata\"&gt;Haloti Ngata&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2006%20NFL%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe made his professional regular season debut and first career start in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Baltimore%20Ravens\"&gt;Baltimore Ravens'&lt;/a&gt; season-opener against the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Cincinnati%20Bengals\"&gt;Cincinnati Bengals&lt;/a&gt; and made seven combined tackles and a pass deflection in their 23\u201316 loss.

In Week 12 Mosley recorded nine solo tackles and made his first career sack on Saints' quarterback &lt;a href=\"Drew%20Brees\"&gt;Drew Brees&lt;/a&gt; for a six-yard loss in the second quarter of the Ravens' 34\u201327 win at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20New%20Orleans%20Saints\"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt;. On December 23, 2014, it was announced that Mosley was selected to play in the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;2015 Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, making him the first Baltimore Ravens player to be voted to the Pro Bowl in their rookie season.
