    "text": "Stewartia malacodendron, the silky camellia, silky stewartia or Virginia stewartia, is a &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; Theaceae. It grows slowly into a large &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt; or small &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;, typically tall, but sometimes as tall as . It is &lt;a href=\"native%20plant\"&gt;native&lt;/a&gt; to the southeastern United States.\nThe Latin &lt;a href=\"Botanical%20name%23Binary%20name\"&gt;specific epithet&lt;/a&gt; \"malacodendron\" literally means \"soft tree\". Its common name \"silky camellia\" alludes to the appearance and texture of the flowers, which resemble those of the related &lt;a href=\"camellias\"&gt;camellias&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nBranches and leaves.\n\"Stewartia malacodendron\" is an &lt;a href=\"understory\"&gt;understory&lt;/a&gt; woodland species with rich brown &lt;a href=\"Bark%20%28botany%29\"&gt;bark&lt;/a&gt;. The young &lt;a href=\"Plant%20stem\"&gt;stem&lt;/a&gt;s are hairy. The &lt;a href=\"branch\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt;es tend to grow with a horizontal orientation from the main stem with the foliage produced on shorter stems branching off these horizontally oriented branches. The alternately arranged, dark green, simple leaves are long with finely toothed margins covered with fine hairs on the undersides, especially on the veins. The leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape with sharp pointed tips. \nBuds and flowers.\nThe buds are covered by two floral bracts with silvery hairs. The flowers are wide, showy, with five white petals. The &lt;a href=\"stamen\"&gt;stamen&lt;/a&gt;s have purple filaments and blue &lt;a href=\"anther\"&gt;anther&lt;/a&gt;s that fill the middle of flat, cup shaped &lt;a href=\"Corolla%20%28flower%29\"&gt;corolla&lt;/a&gt;s. The flowers are born singly from the leaf axils on short stalks with two floral bracts (2\u20134\u00a0mm long) that remain after flowering. The flowers have five green &lt;a href=\"sepal\"&gt;sepal&lt;/a&gt;s, 8\u201311\u00a0mm long and 5\u20139\u00a0mm wide. \"Stewartia malacodendron\" blooms in July and August in the northern part of its range and in April in the southern part of its range. \nSeeds.\nRounded, woody seed &lt;a href=\"Capsule%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;capsules&lt;/a&gt; are produced after flowering, each capsule with 4-5 chambers, and if fertilized, each chamber has 2-4 seeds. The shiny, wingless seeds are full, ovoid in shape and purplish to reddish-brown in color; each seed is 5\u20137\u00a0mm long and 4\u20136\u00a0mm wide.\nRange and habitat.\n\"Stewartia malacodendron\" is native to Texas, where it is rare, being found in a small area along Little Cow Creek near Burkeville, growing at the sides of streams, ravines and wooded bluffs in well draining soils. It is also found in scattered locations in the states of Arkansas, Georgia, Florida (panhandle region), Louisiana and southern Alabama and as far north as Virginia. This tree species is listed as &lt;a href=\"endangered\"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt; in the US states of Arkansas and Florida.\nCultivation.\nPlants have a slow growth rate, are difficult to transplant and are a challenge to &lt;a href=\"Plant%20propagation\"&gt;propagate&lt;/a&gt;. They grow best in partial shade in well draining soils.\n\"Stewartia malacodendron\" has been cultivated in the United States since 1752. It is also grown in parks and gardens elsewhere in the &lt;a href=\"temperate%20climate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; regions of the world, and in the UK has gained the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Horticultural%20Society\"&gt;Royal Horticultural Society&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Award%20of%20Garden%20Merit\"&gt;Award of Garden Merit&lt;/a&gt;."
