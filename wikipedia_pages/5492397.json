    "text": "Maicon Douglas Sisenando (born 26 July 1981), known as Maicon (), is a Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; who plays as a &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Full-back\"&gt;right-back&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"S.P.%20Tre%20Penne\"&gt;Tre Penne&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaicon began his career in his native country with &lt;a href=\"Cruzeiro%20Esporte%20Clube\"&gt;Cruzeiro&lt;/a&gt;, after initially playing for &lt;a href=\"Gr%C3%AAmio%20Foot-Ball%20Porto%20Alegrense\"&gt;Gr\u00eamio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crici%C3%BAma%20Esporte%20Clube\"&gt;Crici\u00fama&lt;/a&gt; at youth level. He played 125 times for Cruzeiro between 2000 and 2004, earning one &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20A\"&gt;national league&lt;/a&gt; title and several other domestic competitions, before moving to &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; when he signed for &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;Ligue 1&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"AS%20Monaco%20FC\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;. After two years in Monaco, he signed for &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, where he became an established first team player, going on to win the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, four &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; titles, the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Club World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and various domestic competitions. In August 2012, he signed for &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;. Maicon failed to secure a regular place in the team, moving back to Italy to play for &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Roma\"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt; the following season. He returned to Brazil in 2017, playing for &lt;a href=\"Ava%C3%AD%20Futebol%20Clube\"&gt;Ava\u00ed&lt;/a&gt;, Crici\u00fama and &lt;a href=\"Villa%20Nova%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Clube\"&gt;Villa Nova&lt;/a&gt;. In January 2021, he joined Italian Serie D side Sona.\nA former &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; international, Maicon made his debut in 2003 and represented his nation on 76 occasions, scoring seven goals. With Brazil, he won a runners-up medal at the &lt;a href=\"2003%20CONCACAF%20Gold%20Cup\"&gt;2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and took part in three &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt; tournaments (winning the competition in &lt;a href=\"2004%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2007%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) and two &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;s (finishing in fourth-place in &lt;a href=\"2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt; on home soil). He was also a member of the Brazilian teams that won consecutive &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt; titles in &lt;a href=\"2005%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2009%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nEarly career.\nA talented right-sided wingback, Maicon debuted for &lt;a href=\"Cruzeiro%20Esporte%20Clube\"&gt;Cruzeiro&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 and after two successful seasons in Brazil, which included winning a championship and being called up for the &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil national team&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. In June 2004, he was signed by &lt;a href=\"AS%20Monaco%20FC\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a32.1\u00a0million.\nInter Milan.\n2006\u20132009.\nIn July 2006, &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; officially announced the signing of Maicon for a fee of \u00a34.8\u00a0million and a five-year contract, along with fellow Brazilian fullback &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201981%29\"&gt;Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; and French midfielder &lt;a href=\"Olivier%20Dacourt\"&gt;Olivier Dacourt&lt;/a&gt;. During his time at Inter, he established himself as a reliable wing-back, solid defensively with an ability of making emphatic runs down the right wing, often setting up goals or scoring himself with his powerful right foot. He overtook Inter captain &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Zanetti\"&gt;Javier Zanetti&lt;/a&gt; as the first choice right back, with the Argentine moving in midfield. He was generally considered one of the best wing-backs in the game.\nDuring a &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; match on 6 March 2007, Maicon was involved in a brawl with &lt;a href=\"Valencia%20CF\"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt; defender &lt;a href=\"David%20Navarro%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;David Navarro&lt;/a&gt;. Maicon was originally banned for six matches, but the ban was reduced to three. A regular under former coach &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&lt;/a&gt;, he contributed his fair share of assists and goals as Inter won a fourth consecutive title in the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2008\u201309 season&lt;/a&gt;, including a match-winning brace against &lt;a href=\"S.S.%20Robur%20Siena\"&gt;Siena&lt;/a&gt;.\n2009\u201310 season.\nMaicon continued the good form he displayed in previous seasons during the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2009\u201310 season&lt;/a&gt;; he started the season by scoring a goal against &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; in the 4\u20130 \"&lt;a href=\"Derby%20della%20Madonnina\"&gt;Derby della Madonnina&lt;/a&gt;\" victory, and then playing well against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; in a 0\u20130 draw at the &lt;a href=\"San%20Siro\"&gt;San Siro&lt;/a&gt;. He subsequently set up &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Milito\"&gt;Diego Milito&lt;/a&gt; on matchday five in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"S.S.C.%20Napoli\"&gt;Napoli&lt;/a&gt;, as Inter defeated Napoli 3\u20131. Maicon continued with his solid performances, notably scoring the last goal in a 5\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Genoa%20C.F.C.\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt; on 17 October and making a fantastic byline run which resulted in Milito's match killing goal in a 5\u20133 home victory over &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt; two weeks later. In the very next match, he scored a goal against &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Livorno%20Calcio\"&gt;Livorno&lt;/a&gt;, where the match ended 2\u20130 for Inter. During Inter's home leg of the \"&lt;a href=\"Derby%20d%27Italia\"&gt;Derby d'Italia&lt;/a&gt;\", the right back opened the scoring against &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt; with one of the most spectacular goals of the season, juggling a loose ball over the onrushing defender at the top of the penalty box and volleying it into the opposite corner.\nLater that month, Maicon scored his first Champions League goal against reigning champions Barcelona when Inter registered a famous victory over the &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalans&lt;/a&gt;. He reportedly knocked out a tooth after he collided with &lt;a href=\"Lionel%20Messi\"&gt;Lionel Messi&lt;/a&gt;. Having overtaken &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Roma\"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt; at the summit of the Serie A and winning the league title, Inter went on to eliminate Barcelona from the Champions League in the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase\"&gt;semi-finals&lt;/a&gt;, with Maicon earning praise. On 22 May 2010, after beating Roma in the Coppa Italia final weeks earlier, Inter won the Champions League, thus obtaining the &lt;a href=\"treble%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;treble&lt;/a&gt;, with a 2\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium\"&gt;Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;. He was named the 2009\u201310 UEFA Club Defender of the Year and his performances earned him a nomination for the &lt;a href=\"Ballon%20d%27Or\"&gt;Ballon d'Or&lt;/a&gt; trophy as Europe's top player.\n2011\u201312 season.\nIn the 2011\u201312 season, Maicon played just 23 games in &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;. In his 23 appearances Maicon scored two goals, the first in a 2\u20131 defeat to Juventus at the San Siro on 29 October 2011, and the second in the \"Derby della Madonnina\" against Milan in a 4\u20132 win, on 6 May 2012. He scored from outside the penalty box with a belting shot into the top left corner of &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Amelia\"&gt;Marco Amelia&lt;/a&gt;'s goal, in a game in which teammate Diego Milito scored a hat-trick.\nManchester City.\nOn 31 August 2012, Maicon signed for &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; in a \u00a33\u00a0million transfer deal, taking the number 3 shirt. He made his City debut on 15 September in a 1\u20131 draw against &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Stoke City&lt;/a&gt;. He made his home debut in a 2\u20131 win against &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt; on 11 November, replacing centre-back &lt;a href=\"Matija%20Nastasi%C4%87\"&gt;Matija Nastasi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; in the second half. Maicon struggled with injury throughout the season, but when fit he found it a struggle to break into the City team, ultimately failing to dislodge &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Zabaleta\"&gt;Pablo Zabaleta&lt;/a&gt; from the right back position and struggling to even supplant the injury-prone &lt;a href=\"Micah%20Richards\"&gt;Micah Richards&lt;/a&gt; for the substitute right-back role fit. Maicon therefore rarely made City's substitutes' bench. When manager &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Mancini\"&gt;Roberto Mancini&lt;/a&gt; was sacked at the end of the season, his replacement &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Pellegrini\"&gt;Manuel Pellegrini&lt;/a&gt; was quick to move the player, omitting him from the club's pre-season tour of South Africa and commenting that he would not be in the squad this year.\nRoma.\nOn 18 July 2013, Maicon returned to Serie A after Manchester City allowed him to move on a free transfer to Roma. His transfer was made official by Roma on 26 July on his 32nd birthday, with Maicon signing a two-year deal.\nRoma started the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20A.S.%20Roma%20season\"&gt;2013\u201314 season&lt;/a&gt; under manager &lt;a href=\"Rudi%20Garcia\"&gt;Rudi Garcia&lt;/a&gt; with ten wins in its first ten Serie A games. He was allocated squad number 13, and made his competitive debut on 25 August in the opening league week against &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Livorno%20Calcio\"&gt;Livorno&lt;/a&gt;, playing full-90 minutes in a 0\u20132 away win. On 25 September, during the away match against &lt;a href=\"U.C.%20Sampdoria\"&gt;Sampdoria&lt;/a&gt;, Maicon suffered an muscular injury and was replaced in the 35th minute; following the match, it was reported he had a first degree lesion in the right thigh, and the recovery time was around 15 days. Maicon returned in action for the league match against &lt;a href=\"S.S.C.%20Napoli\"&gt;Napoli&lt;/a&gt;, helping the team to win 2\u20130 at home. Later on 8 December, Maicon scored his first goal for Roma in the 2\u20131 home win against &lt;a href=\"ACF%20Fiorentina\"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt;, returning the team to the winning ways after four consecutive draws.\nHe started 2014 by scoring his second goal of the season in Roma's 4\u20130 home defeat of &lt;a href=\"Genoa%20C.F.C.\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt;. Maicon made his &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt; debut nine days later in the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Coppa%20Italia%23Quarter-finals\"&gt;quarter-final&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;, contributing in a 1\u20130 home win and progression to the semi-final.\nOn 13 October 2014, Maicon agreed a contract extension with Roma, extending his stay at &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Olimpico\"&gt;Stadio Olimpico&lt;/a&gt; until June 2016.\nAva\u00ed.\nOn 31 May 2017, Maicon signed with Brazilian side &lt;a href=\"Ava%C3%AD%20Futebol%20Clube\"&gt;Ava\u00ed&lt;/a&gt; on a one-year contract. After training for a few weeks with &lt;a href=\"Botafogo%20de%20Futebol%20e%20Regatas\"&gt;Botafogo&lt;/a&gt;, he didn't sign with the Glorioso, instead going to the club from &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29\"&gt;Santa Catarina&lt;/a&gt;. Maicon came back to Brazilian football after 13 years, after leaving &lt;a href=\"Cruzeiro%20Esporte%20Clube\"&gt;Cruzeiro&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"AS%20Monaco\"&gt;AS Monaco&lt;/a&gt;. In December 2017, Maicon announced his retirement after spending one season with &lt;a href=\"Avai%20Futebol%20Clube\"&gt;Ava\u00ed&lt;/a&gt; who were relegated to &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20B\"&gt;S\u00e9rie B&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrici\u00fama.\nOn 22 December 2018, Maicon announced he had signed a one-year contract with &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20B\"&gt;S\u00e9rie B&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Crici%C3%BAma%20Esporte%20Clube\"&gt;Crici\u00fama&lt;/a&gt;. Maicon cited his son as one of the reasons for his return to football and his previous history with the club as a youth player.\nVilla Nova.\nIn September 2020, Maicon joined &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20D\"&gt;Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie D&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Villa%20Nova%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Clube\"&gt;Villa Nova&lt;/a&gt;.\nSona.\nIn January 2021, it was confirmed that Maicon had joined &lt;a href=\"Serie%20D\"&gt;Serie D&lt;/a&gt; side Sona on a six-month deal.\nTre Penne.\nOn 14 June, Maicon joined &lt;a href=\"S.P.%20Tre%20Penne\"&gt;Tre Penne&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nAfter appearing for Brazil's &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20under-20%20football%20team\"&gt;under-20&lt;/a&gt; team at the &lt;a href=\"2001%20FIFA%20World%20Youth%20Championship\"&gt;2001 FIFA World Youth Championship&lt;/a&gt;, Maicon made his senior international debut in the team's opening game of the &lt;a href=\"2003%20CONCACAF%20Gold%20Cup\"&gt;2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; on 12 July 2003. He was named in the team of the tournament as Brazil finished as runner-up.\nHe went on to become the first choice right-back for the \"Sele\u00e7\u00e3o\", winning the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2004%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2007%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2005%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2009%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared in his first &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; and scored on his tournament debut, a 2\u20131 win over &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn June 2014, Maicon was selected in Brazil's squad for the &lt;a href=\"2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2014 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. He replaced &lt;a href=\"Dani%20Alves\"&gt;Dani Alves&lt;/a&gt; as the team's starting right-back for the 2\u20131 &lt;a href=\"2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Quarter-finals\"&gt;quarter-final&lt;/a&gt; win against &lt;a href=\"Colombia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fortaleza\"&gt;Fortaleza&lt;/a&gt; and for the remainder of the tournament.\nOn 7 September 2014, Maicon was dismissed from the Brazil squad for an unspecified \"internal problem\".\nStyle of play.\nDue to his work-rate and stamina, Maicon is known to be capable of aiding his team both offensively and defensively, and has been used both as a &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Full-back\"&gt;full-back&lt;/a&gt; and as an attacking &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Wing-back\"&gt;wing-back&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Midfielder%23Winger\"&gt;wide midfielder&lt;/a&gt;. He is gifted with outstanding physical attributes, athleticism and excellent technical skills, as well as good vision, &lt;a href=\"Cross%20%28football%29\"&gt;crossing&lt;/a&gt; ability and a powerful shot, which made him a dangerous attacking threat down the right flank in his prime. Due to his success, strength, pace and power, he earned the nickname \"Il Colosso\" (\"The Colossus\") during his time at Inter, where he developed into one of the best attacking full-backs in the world, forming a notable partnership with teammate Javier Zanetti.\nCareer statistics.\nInternational goals.\n\"Brazil score listed first, score column indicates score after each Maicon goal.\"\nHonours.\nClub.\nCruzeiro\nInter Milan\nInternational.\nBrazil\nPersonal life.\nMaicon is a great-nephew of former Brazil international footballer &lt;a href=\"Valdomiro%20Vaz%20Franco\"&gt;Valdomiro&lt;/a&gt;."
