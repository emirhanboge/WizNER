    "text": "Dragana Todorovi\u0107 (; ; born 15 March 1974), known by her stage name Jana (), is a Serbian &lt;a href=\"turbo-folk\"&gt;turbo-folk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pop%20folk\"&gt;pop folk&lt;/a&gt; singer.\nBiography.\nJana was born in the village of Babin Most, near the town of &lt;a href=\"Obili%C4%87\"&gt;Obili\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;SFR Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; in 1974.\nHer career started at the age of fourteen, in 1988, when she visited a well-known &lt;a href=\"kafana\"&gt;kafana&lt;/a&gt; in the town of &lt;a href=\"Obili%C4%87\"&gt;Obili\u0107&lt;/a&gt; one night with her parents and brother (who played the &lt;a href=\"accordion\"&gt;accordion&lt;/a&gt;). She had worn a white overcoat and pink hat. During dinner, she took the microphone, got a chair, and, being shy, turned her back against the audience and started singing \"\u0160to me pita\u0161\" (\"Why Are You Asking Me\") by &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0emsa%20Suljakovi%C4%87\"&gt;\u0160emsa Suljakovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; to roaring applause.\nAfter finishing the &lt;a href=\"Stevan%20Stojanovi%C4%87%20Mokranjac\"&gt;Stevan Mokranjac&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"music%20academy\"&gt;music academy&lt;/a&gt; in her hometown, she recorded an album in 1992 that sold very few copies and flopped. She went back to performing in kafanas throughout &lt;a href=\"Kosovo\"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;, then took a short break from singing due to the disappointment of her last album, working as a music educator.\nIn 1997, she met singer Marina \u017divkovi\u0107 in &lt;a href=\"Kosovska%20Mitrovica\"&gt;Kosovska Mitrovica&lt;/a&gt;, a meeting which kick-started her career. As \u017divkovi\u0107 was preparing for her concert, she overheard Todorovi\u0107 singing and was left 'breathless'. She asked for Jana to come to her table and talk and after the conversation, she recommended Jana to friend, Ivan Todorovi\u0107 (Jana's future husband) who owned a &lt;a href=\"discoth%C3%A8que\"&gt;discoth\u00e8que&lt;/a&gt; and was in need of a live band. Not long after, Ivan traveled to Pri\u0161tina to meet with Jana. That day, Jana and her cousin met up with him near the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hotel%20Prishtina\"&gt;Grand Hotel&lt;/a&gt; and struck up a record deal. In October 1997, with great sadness, she left her home country and moved to Germany, four months prior to the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Kosovo\"&gt;war in Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;. She became extremely homesick in Germany, but was unable to travel home because of the insecurity. She was signed to the now-defunct record label &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Production\"&gt;Zabava miliona (ZAM)&lt;/a&gt;. As there already was a famous singer called &lt;a href=\"Dragana%20Mirkovi%C4%87\"&gt;Dragana Mirkovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sa%C5%A1a%20Popovi%C4%87\"&gt;Sa\u0161a Popovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, the label's director, recommended her to adopt Jana as her stage name. During the recording of her second album, \"Sokolica\" (\"Falcon\", 1998), she fell in love with Ivan Todorovi\u0107 and they later married. Her first album was a huge success and she went on tour with famous singer &lt;a href=\"Lepa%20Brena\"&gt;Lepa Brena&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe then recorded her third album, \"Prolaznica\" (\"Free Pass\", 1999), under the label &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Production\"&gt;Grand Production&lt;/a&gt; (formerly ZaM).\nJana's fourth studio album, \"Ostavi mi drugove\" (\"Leave My Friends\", 2000), featured the hit songs \"Ko visoko leti\" (\"He Who Flies High\"), \"Robinja\" (\"Slave\") and the title track. It was followed by her fifth release: \"Prevare do prevare\" (\"Affair After Affair\", 2001) had the hit songs \"Barabar\" (\"Unison\") and \"Tuge mi dovoljno\" (\"I've had enough pain\").\nFor her seventh album, \"Zidovi\" (\"Walls\", 2003), she started to work with VIP Production (later renamed &lt;a href=\"BN%20Music\"&gt;BN Music&lt;/a&gt;), a label founded and owned by her husband Ivan Todorovi\u0107. It was the first album distributed by VIP Production.\nJana released three more albums under the label: \"Malo magije\" (\"A Little Magic\", 2005), \"Ku\u0107i, ku\u0107i\" (\"Home, Home\", 2007) and \"Jana Dva\" (\"Jana Two\", 2011).\nOn 2 November 2006, Jana and her husband had a daughter, Kristina D\u017eulijen Todorovi\u0107.\nDiscography.\nAlbums.\nSokolica (1998)\nProlaznica (1999)\nOstavi mi drugove (2000)\nPrevara do prevare (2001)\n5 (2002)\nZidovi (2003)\nMalo magije (2005)\nKu\u0107i, ku\u0107i (2007)\nJana Dva (2011)\n&lt;br&gt;New songs\nOld songs as bonus tracks"
