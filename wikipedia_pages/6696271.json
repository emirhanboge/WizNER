Harrison's support for the pro-slavery South countered against his father's support for anti-slavery.\nEarly life.\nHarrison was born in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20Burton%20Harrison\"&gt;Jesse Burton Harrison&lt;/a&gt; (who died three years later) and Frances Anne Brand Harrison. He attended the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Mississippi\"&gt;University of Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; from 1854 to 1855. In 1859 he graduated from &lt;a href=\"Yale%20University\"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a member of &lt;a href=\"Skull%20and%20Bones\"&gt;Skull and Bones&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year he took a job at the University of Mississippi as an associate professor of mathematics and began to study law.\nThe Civil War and its aftermath.\nIn February 1862 Harrison became the private secretary to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; he was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army\"&gt;Union Army&lt;/a&gt; with Jefferson Davis and &lt;a href=\"Varina%20Davis\"&gt;Varina Davis&lt;/a&gt;, and imprisoned at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Delaware\"&gt;Fort Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, where he resumed his law studies.\nIn 1866 Harrison was released, settled in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, and was admitted to &lt;a href=\"Bar%20%28law%29\"&gt;the bar&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling himself established, in November 1867 he married his sweetheart from his &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Richmond, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, days, &lt;a href=\"Constance%20Cary%20Harrison\"&gt;Constance Cary Harrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1872 he was an envoy to &lt;a href=\"Santo%20Domingo\"&gt;Santo Domingo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Dominican%20Republic\"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt;, with Samuel P. Samuels and T. Scott Stewart, to negotiate annexation with &lt;a href=\"Buenaventura%20B%C3%A1ez\"&gt;Buenaventura B\u00e1ez&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater life.\nIn 1875, Harrison became the secretary and counsel of New York City's Rapid Transit Commission. The following year he actively campaigned for presidential candidate &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20J.%20Tilden\"&gt;Samuel J. Tilden&lt;/a&gt;. In 1880, Harrison attended the Democratic convention in &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; where he opposed &lt;a href=\"William%20Jennings%20Bryan\"&gt;William Jennings Bryan&lt;/a&gt;. After 1880 Harrison began to lose interest in politics. In 1893 he declined President &lt;a href=\"Grover%20Cleveland\"&gt;Grover Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;'s offers of appointments as Assistant Secretary of State and ambassador to &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nBurton and Constance Harrison were the parents of &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%20Harrison\"&gt;Fairfax Harrison&lt;/a&gt; (1869-1938) and &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Burton%20Harrison\"&gt;Francis Burton Harrison&lt;/a&gt; (1873-1957).\nBurton Harrison died in 1904 while visiting &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;"
