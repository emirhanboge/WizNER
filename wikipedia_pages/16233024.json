    "text": "Tzimtzincha-Tangaxuan II (died February 14, 1530) was the last \"&lt;a href=\"cazonci\"&gt;cazonci&lt;/a&gt;\" (monarch) of the &lt;a href=\"Tarascan%20state\"&gt;Tarascan state&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom of the &lt;a href=\"Pur%C3%A9pecha%20people\"&gt;Pur\u00e9pecha&lt;/a&gt;, from 1520\u20131530. He was &lt;a href=\"baptized\"&gt;baptized&lt;/a&gt; Francisco when his realm made a peace treaty with &lt;a href=\"Hern%C3%A1n%20Cort%C3%A9s\"&gt;Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;. He was executed by burning by &lt;a href=\"Nu%C3%B1o%20de%20Guzm%C3%A1n\"&gt;Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; on February 14, 1530.\nAfter hearing about the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Aztec%20Empire\"&gt;Aztec Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Tang\u00e1xuan II sent emissaries to the Spanish victors. A few Spaniards returned with them to &lt;a href=\"Tzintzuntzan%20%28Mesoamerican%20site%29\"&gt;Tzintzuntzan&lt;/a&gt; where they were presented to Tang\u00e1xuan and gifts were exchanged. The Spaniards returned with samples of gold and Cort\u00e9s' interest in the Tarascan state was awakened. In 1522 a Spanish force under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Crist%C3%B3bal%20de%20Olid\"&gt;Crist\u00f3bal de Olid&lt;/a&gt; was sent into Tarascan territory and arrived at Tzintzuntzan within days. The Tarascan army numbered many thousands, perhaps as many as 100,000, but at the crucial moment they chose not to fight. Tang\u00e1xuan submitted to the Spanish administration, but for his cooperation was allowed a large degree of autonomy. This resulted in a strange arrangement where both Cort\u00e9s and Tang\u00e1xuan considered themselves rulers of Michoac\u00e1n for the following years: the population of the area paid tribute to them both.\n&lt;a href=\"Nu%C3%B1o%20Beltr%C3%A1n%20de%20Guzm%C3%A1n\"&gt;Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, then president of the first Audiencia decided, to march on northwestern Mexico with a force of 5,000\u20138,000 men in search for new populations to subdue, and when he arrived in &lt;a href=\"Michoac%C3%A1n\"&gt;Michoac\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; and found out that Tang\u00e1xuan was still \"de facto\" ruler of his empire he allied himself with a Tarascan noble Don Pedro Panza, known as Cuinier\u00e1ngari, against the Cazonci. The Cazonci was tried for plotting a rebellion, withholding tribute, sodomy and heresy, and he was tortured and executed. His ashes were thrown into the &lt;a href=\"Lerma%20river\"&gt;Lerma river&lt;/a&gt;. A period of violence and turbulence began. During the next decades, Tarascan puppet rulers were installed by the Spanish government."
