    "text": "Qadi Kamal al-Din Husayn ibn Mu'in al-Din Ali Maybudi (), better known as Qadi Husayn Maybudi (), was an Iranian scholar and \"&lt;a href=\"qadi\"&gt;qadi&lt;/a&gt;\" (judge) in the city of &lt;a href=\"Yazd\"&gt;Yazd&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Aq%20Qoyunlu\"&gt;Aq Qoyunlu&lt;/a&gt;. He was executed in 1504 after having participated in a failed revolt against the &lt;a href=\"Safavid%20Iran\"&gt;Safavid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shah\"&gt;shah&lt;/a&gt; (king) &lt;a href=\"Ismail%20I\"&gt;Ismail I&lt;/a&gt; ().\nBiography.\nBorn in 1449, Maybudi was presumably a native of the city of &lt;a href=\"Maybud\"&gt;Maybud&lt;/a&gt; in southern Iran, rather than the neighbouring city of &lt;a href=\"Yazd\"&gt;Yazd&lt;/a&gt;. The area was then part of the &lt;a href=\"Timurid%20Empire\"&gt;Timurid Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He belonged to an affluent and influential family of aristocratic origin. He was the son of Khwaja Mu'in al-Din Ali, a prominent philanthropist and &lt;a href=\"vizier\"&gt;vizier&lt;/a&gt; of Yazd. At a young age, Maybudi left for Shiraz to study under prominent scholars such as &lt;a href=\"Jalal%20al-Din%20Davani\"&gt;Jalal al-Din Davani&lt;/a&gt; (died 1503). He was executed in 1504 after having participated in a failed revolt against the &lt;a href=\"Safavid%20Iran\"&gt;Safavid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shah\"&gt;shah&lt;/a&gt; (king) &lt;a href=\"Ismail%20I\"&gt;Ismail I&lt;/a&gt; (). He was survived by at least one of his sons, Mirza Abd al-Rashid al-Munajjim."
