    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"geometry\"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt;, a polygon () is a &lt;a href=\"plane%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shape\"&gt;figure&lt;/a&gt; that is described by a finite number of straight &lt;a href=\"line%20segment\"&gt;line segment&lt;/a&gt;s connected to form a closed \"&lt;a href=\"polygonal%20chain\"&gt;polygonal chain&lt;/a&gt;\" (or \"polygonal circuit\"). The bounded plane &lt;a href=\"region%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;, the bounding circuit, or the two together, may be called a polygon.\nThe segments of a polygonal circuit are called its \"&lt;a href=\"edge%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;edges&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"sides\". The points where two edges meet are the polygon's \"&lt;a href=\"Vertex%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;vertices&lt;/a&gt;\" (singular: vertex) or \"corners\". The interior of a solid polygon is sometimes called its \"body\". An \"n\"-gon is a polygon with \"n\" sides; for example, a &lt;a href=\"triangle\"&gt;triangle&lt;/a&gt; is a 3-gon.\nA &lt;a href=\"simple%20polygon\"&gt;simple polygon&lt;/a&gt; is one which does not intersect itself. Mathematicians are often concerned only with the bounding polygonal chains of simple polygons and they often define a polygon accordingly. A polygonal boundary may be allowed to cross over itself, creating &lt;a href=\"star%20polygon\"&gt;star polygon&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20self-intersecting%20polygons\"&gt;self-intersecting polygons&lt;/a&gt;.\nA polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general &lt;a href=\"polytope\"&gt;polytope&lt;/a&gt; in any number of dimensions. There are many more &lt;a href=\"%23Generalizations\"&gt;generalizations of polygons&lt;/a&gt; defined for different purposes.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"polygon\" derives from the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; adjective \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2 (\"pol\u00fas\") 'much', 'many' and \u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 (\"g\u014dn\u00eda\") 'corner' or 'angle'. It has been suggested that \u03b3\u03cc\u03bd\u03c5 (\"g\u00f3nu\") 'knee' may be the origin of \"gon\".\nClassification.\nNumber of sides.\nPolygons are primarily classified by the number of sides. See the &lt;a href=\"%23Naming\"&gt;table below&lt;/a&gt;.\nConvexity and non-convexity.\nPolygons may be characterized by their convexity or type of non-convexity:\nEquality and symmetry.\nThe property of regularity may be defined in other ways: a polygon is regular if and only if it is both isogonal and isotoxal, or equivalently it is both cyclic and equilateral. A non-convex regular polygon is called a \"regular &lt;a href=\"star%20polygon\"&gt;star polygon&lt;/a&gt;\".\nProperties and formulas.\n&lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20geometry\"&gt;Euclidean geometry&lt;/a&gt; is assumed throughout.\nAngles.\nAny polygon has as many corners as it has sides. Each corner has several angles. The two most important ones are:\nArea.\nIn this section, the vertices of the polygon under consideration are taken to be formula_6 in order. For convenience in some formulas, the notation will also be used.\nIf the polygon is non-self-intersecting (that is, &lt;a href=\"simple%20polygon\"&gt;simple&lt;/a&gt;), the signed &lt;a href=\"area%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; is\nor, using &lt;a href=\"determinant\"&gt;determinant&lt;/a&gt;s\nwhere formula_9 is the squared distance between formula_10 and formula_11\nThe signed area depends on the ordering of the vertices and of the &lt;a href=\"orientation%20%28vector%20space%29\"&gt;orientation&lt;/a&gt; of the plane. Commonly, the positive orientation is defined by the (counterclockwise) rotation that maps the positive -axis to the positive -axis. If the vertices are ordered counterclockwise (that is, according to positive orientation), the signed area is positive; otherwise, it is negative. In either case, the area formula is correct in &lt;a href=\"absolute%20value\"&gt;absolute value&lt;/a&gt;. This is commonly called the &lt;a href=\"shoelace%20formula\"&gt;shoelace formula&lt;/a&gt; or Surveyor's formula.\nThe area \"A\" of a simple polygon can also be computed if the lengths of the sides, \"a\"1, \"a\"2, ..., \"an\" and the &lt;a href=\"exterior%20angle\"&gt;exterior angle&lt;/a&gt;s, \"\u03b8\"1, \"\u03b8\"2, ..., \"\u03b8n\" are known, from:\nThe formula was described by Lopshits in 1963.\nIf the polygon can be drawn on an equally spaced grid such that all its vertices are grid points, &lt;a href=\"Pick%27s%20theorem\"&gt;Pick's theorem&lt;/a&gt; gives a simple formula for the polygon's area based on the numbers of interior and boundary grid points: the former number plus one-half the latter number, minus 1.\nIn every polygon with perimeter \"p\" and area \"A \", the &lt;a href=\"isoperimetric%20inequality\"&gt;isoperimetric inequality&lt;/a&gt; formula_13 holds.\nFor any two simple polygons of equal area, the &lt;a href=\"Bolyai%E2%80%93Gerwien%20theorem\"&gt;Bolyai\u2013Gerwien theorem&lt;/a&gt; asserts that the first can be cut into polygonal pieces which can be reassembled to form the second polygon.\nThe lengths of the sides of a polygon do not in general determine its area. However, if the polygon is simple and cyclic then the sides \"do\" determine the area. Of all \"n\"-gons with given side lengths, the one with the largest area is cyclic. Of all \"n\"-gons with a given perimeter, the one with the largest area is regular (and therefore cyclic).\nRegular polygons.\nMany specialized formulas apply to the areas of &lt;a href=\"regular%20polygon\"&gt;regular polygon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe area of a regular polygon is given in terms of the radius \"r\" of its &lt;a href=\"inscribed%20circle\"&gt;inscribed circle&lt;/a&gt; and its perimeter \"p\" by \nThis radius is also termed its &lt;a href=\"apothem\"&gt;apothem&lt;/a&gt; and is often represented as \"a\".\nThe area of a regular \"n\"-gon in terms of the radius \"R\" of its &lt;a href=\"circumscribed%20circle\"&gt;circumscribed circle&lt;/a&gt; can be expressed trigonometrically as:\nThe area of a regular \"n\"-gon inscribed in a unit-radius circle, with side \"s\" and interior angle formula_16 can also be expressed trigonometrically as:\nSelf-intersecting.\nThe area of a &lt;a href=\"Complex%20polygon\"&gt;self-intersecting polygon&lt;/a&gt; can be defined in two different ways, giving different answers:\nCentroid.\nUsing the same convention for vertex coordinates as in the previous section, the coordinates of the centroid of a solid simple polygon are \nIn these formulas, the signed value of area formula_20 must be used.\nFor &lt;a href=\"triangle\"&gt;triangle&lt;/a&gt;s (), the centroids of the vertices and of the solid shape are the same, but, in general, this is not true for . The &lt;a href=\"centroid\"&gt;centroid&lt;/a&gt; of the vertex set of a polygon with vertices has the coordinates\nGeneralizations.\nThe idea of a polygon has been generalized in various ways. Some of the more important include:\nNaming.\nThe word \"polygon\" comes from &lt;a href=\"Late%20Latin\"&gt;Late Latin&lt;/a&gt; \"polyg\u014dnum\" (a noun), from &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (\"polyg\u014dnon/polug\u014dnon\"), noun use of neuter of \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (\"polyg\u014dnos/polug\u014dnos\", the masculine adjective), meaning \"many-angled\". Individual polygons are named (and sometimes classified) according to the number of sides, combining a &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;-derived &lt;a href=\"numerical%20prefix\"&gt;numerical prefix&lt;/a&gt; with the suffix \"-gon\", e.g. \"&lt;a href=\"pentagon\"&gt;pentagon&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"dodecagon\"&gt;dodecagon&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"triangle\"&gt;triangle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"quadrilateral\"&gt;quadrilateral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nonagon\"&gt;nonagon&lt;/a&gt; are exceptions.\nBeyond decagons (10-sided) and dodecagons (12-sided), mathematicians generally use numerical notation, for example 17-gon and 257-gon.\nExceptions exist for side counts that are easily expressed in verbal form (e.g. 20 and 30), or are used by non-mathematicians. Some special polygons also have their own names; for example the &lt;a href=\"regular%20polygon\"&gt;regular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"star%20polygon\"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pentagon\"&gt;pentagon&lt;/a&gt; is also known as the &lt;a href=\"pentagram\"&gt;pentagram&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstructing higher names.\nTo construct the name of a polygon with more than 20 and less than 100 edges, combine the prefixes as follows. The \"kai\" term applies to 13-gons and higher and was used by &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Kepler\"&gt;Kepler&lt;/a&gt;, and advocated by &lt;a href=\"John%20H.%20Conway\"&gt;John H. Conway&lt;/a&gt; for clarity of concatenated prefix numbers in the naming of &lt;a href=\"quasiregular%20polyhedron\"&gt;quasiregular polyhedra&lt;/a&gt;, though not all sources use it.\nHistory.\nPolygons have been known since ancient times. The &lt;a href=\"regular%20polygon\"&gt;regular polygon&lt;/a&gt;s were known to the ancient Greeks, with the &lt;a href=\"pentagram\"&gt;pentagram&lt;/a&gt;, a non-convex regular polygon (&lt;a href=\"star%20polygon\"&gt;star polygon&lt;/a&gt;), appearing as early as the 7th century B.C. on a &lt;a href=\"krater\"&gt;krater&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Aristophanes%20%28vase%20painter%29\"&gt;Aristophanes&lt;/a&gt;, found at &lt;a href=\"Caere\"&gt;Caere&lt;/a&gt; and now in the &lt;a href=\"Capitoline%20Museum\"&gt;Capitoline Museum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first known systematic study of non-convex polygons in general was made by &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Bradwardine\"&gt;Thomas Bradwardine&lt;/a&gt; in the 14th century.\nIn 1952, &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20Colin%20Shephard\"&gt;Geoffrey Colin Shephard&lt;/a&gt; generalized the idea of polygons to the complex plane, where each &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; dimension is accompanied by an &lt;a href=\"imaginary%20number\"&gt;imaginary&lt;/a&gt; one, to create &lt;a href=\"complex%20polytope\"&gt;complex polygons&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn nature.\nPolygons appear in rock formations, most commonly as the flat facets of &lt;a href=\"crystal\"&gt;crystal&lt;/a&gt;s, where the angles between the sides depend on the type of mineral from which the crystal is made.\nRegular hexagons can occur when the cooling of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; forms areas of tightly packed columns of &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt;, which may be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Causeway\"&gt;Giant's Causeway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, or at the &lt;a href=\"Devil%27s%20Postpile\"&gt;Devil's Postpile&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"biology\"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;, the surface of the wax &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s is an array of &lt;a href=\"hexagon\"&gt;hexagon&lt;/a&gt;s, and the sides and base of each cell are also polygons.\nComputer graphics.\nIn &lt;a href=\"computer%20graphics\"&gt;computer graphics&lt;/a&gt;, a polygon is a &lt;a href=\"geometric%20primitive\"&gt;primitive&lt;/a&gt; used in modelling and rendering. They are defined in a database, containing arrays of &lt;a href=\"vertex%20%28computer%20graphics%29\"&gt;vertices&lt;/a&gt; (the coordinates of the &lt;a href=\"vertex%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;geometrical vertices&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other attributes of the polygon, such as color, shading and texture), connectivity information, and &lt;a href=\"material%20%28computer%20graphics%29\"&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt;.\nAny surface is modelled as a tessellation called &lt;a href=\"polygon%20mesh\"&gt;polygon mesh&lt;/a&gt;. If a square mesh has points (vertices) per side, there are \"n\" squared squares in the mesh, or 2\"n\" squared triangles since there are two triangles in a square. There are vertices per triangle. Where \"n\" is large, this approaches one half. Or, each vertex inside the square mesh connects four edges (lines).\nThe imaging system calls up the structure of polygons needed for the scene to be created from the database. This is transferred to active memory and finally, to the display system (screen, TV monitors etc.) so that the scene can be viewed. During this process, the imaging system renders polygons in correct perspective ready for transmission of the processed data to the display system. Although polygons are two-dimensional, through the system computer they are placed in a visual scene in the correct three-dimensional orientation.\nIn computer graphics and &lt;a href=\"computational%20geometry\"&gt;computational geometry&lt;/a&gt;, it is often necessary to determine whether a given point formula_23 lies inside a simple polygon given by a sequence of line segments. This is called the &lt;a href=\"point%20in%20polygon\"&gt;point in polygon&lt;/a&gt; test."
