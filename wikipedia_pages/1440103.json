    "text": "Limbach Flugmotoren (\"Limbach Aero Engines\") is a German company that produces &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20engine\"&gt;aircraft engine&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nThe company is named after &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Limbach\"&gt;Peter Limbach&lt;/a&gt; who expanded his father's engine repair business in the 1970s in &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6nigswinter\"&gt;K\u00f6nigswinter&lt;/a&gt;. By May 2006, Limbach had produced more than 6000 engines. The engines are certified according to CS-22 Subpart H for use in &lt;a href=\"motorglider\"&gt;motorglider&lt;/a&gt;s, CS-LSA and &lt;a href=\"CS-VLA\"&gt;CS-VLA&lt;/a&gt; type of aircraft.\nMost Limbach engines are based on the &lt;a href=\"Volkswagen\"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flat-4\"&gt;flat-4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Flat%20engine\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt; unit with displacement of up to 2.4 liters, and up to 160 &lt;a href=\"horsepower\"&gt;BHP&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"turbocharger\"&gt;turbocharged&lt;/a&gt; model. The smaller engines, all 1700cc and some 2000cc, are based on the air cooled \"Type 1\" unit, also referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Volkswagen%20air-cooled%20engine\"&gt;Beetle&lt;/a&gt; engine. The larger engines, some 2000cc and all 2400cc, are based on the &lt;a href=\"Wasserboxer\"&gt;Wasserboxer&lt;/a&gt;. The most powerful versions of the 2400cc engines have water cooled cylinder heads as well as electronic fuel injection and electronic ignition. Limbach also makes &lt;a href=\"two-stroke%20engine\"&gt;two-stroke engine&lt;/a&gt;s for UAV as well as uncertified versions of a few &lt;a href=\"four-stroke%20engine\"&gt;four-stroke engine&lt;/a&gt;s for the experimental &lt;a href=\"Homebuilt%20aircraft\"&gt;Homebuilt aircraft&lt;/a&gt; market. For most aviation enthusiasts though, Limbach is synonymous to the powerplant found in most German &lt;a href=\"Motorglider\"&gt;Motorglider&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBy late 2011 the company planned to close due to a worsened climate in which they were unable to operate. Allegedly an open letter dated 25 August 2011 could be found on their website, saying: \"Years of ever increasing regulations and requirements have been choking us. Our efforts to operate in that environment were not successful because we cannot provide the necessary resources. Additionally there are government activities that hinder our current business and we cannot make plans for the future.\" This letter has been archived by the Internet Archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20120308041156/http://www.limflug.de/downloads/905/Ausstieg_Neuanfang01.pdf\nIn late 2012 it was announced that the Limbachs assets had been sold to Mr. Chen Shuide who tends to continue producing Limbach engines with Peter Limbach still on board. As of April 2014, the company is still in business.\nIn September 2020, Germany's intelligence services reported that &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.thenational.ae/world/germany-stops-iran-buying-mini-engines-after-they-were-found-in-houthi-drones-1.1083080\"&gt;motors sold to Iran were found in drones used by Houthi rebels.&lt;/a&gt;"
