    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"classical%20Athens\"&gt;classical Athenian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, probol\u00ea (plural probolai, literally \"a throwing forward\") was a preliminary &lt;a href=\"Criminal%20accusation\"&gt;accusation&lt;/a&gt;, which an intending &lt;a href=\"plaintiff\"&gt;plaintiff&lt;/a&gt; could bring before the &lt;a href=\"Ecclesia%20%28ancient%20Greece%29\"&gt;ecclesia&lt;/a&gt; (assembly) rather than directly to a dikasterion (court). This vote of the ecclesia had no formal effect: it did not bind a successful plaintiff to continue his action in court, nor apparently did it prevent him from doing so if unsuccessful; it imposed no penalty either on plaintiff or on defendant. It did, however, strengthen the hand of the successful plaintiff: after the manner of a &lt;a href=\"straw%20poll\"&gt;straw poll&lt;/a&gt;, it showed which way the wind was blowing. We hear of probol\u00ea being used in disputes which arise at festivals, and also against &lt;a href=\"sycophant\"&gt;sycophant&lt;/a&gt;s and political leaders who have allegedly deceived the people with false promises."
