    "text": "USS \"Whippoorwill\" (AM-35) was a &lt;a href=\"Lapwing%20class%20minesweeper\"&gt;\"Lapwing\"-class&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Minesweeper%20%28ship%29\"&gt;minesweeper&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first \"Whippoorwill\" to be so named by the Navy, \"Minesweeper No. 35\" was laid down on 12 December 1917 at &lt;a href=\"Mobile%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Mobile, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, by the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20Drydock%20and%20Shipbuilding%20Company\"&gt;Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company&lt;/a&gt;; launched on 4 July 1918; sponsored by Miss M. I. Evans; and commissioned on 1 April 1919.\nWorld War I mine clearance.\nAfter fitting out, \"Whippoorwill\" departed &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, Massachusetts, on 3 July 1919, bound for Scotland. Operating subsequently from the port of &lt;a href=\"Kirkwall\"&gt;Kirkwall&lt;/a&gt;, the minesweeper participated in the clearing of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20Mine%20Barrage\"&gt;North Sea Mine Barrage&lt;/a&gt; as part of Division 3, &lt;a href=\"Minesweeping%20Squadron\"&gt;Minesweeping Squadron&lt;/a&gt;, Atlantic Fleet. This was completed by late autumn of 1919.\nPost-war transfer to the Pacific Fleet.\nReturning to the United States in November 1919, \"Whipporwill\" was later assigned to the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Pacific%20Fleet\"&gt;U.S. Pacific Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. Having been classified as AM-35 on 17 July 1920, the minesweeper arrived at &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, her new home port, on 1 March 1921. She would operate out of that base for the next 20 years, with brief periods spent as station ship at &lt;a href=\"Pago%20Pago\"&gt;Pago Pago&lt;/a&gt;, Samoa, between 1931 and 1934.\n\"Whippoorwill's\" prime duty was service to the Fleet. Besides filling the role for which she was designed\u2014sweeping and laying mines\u2014upon occasion she towed targets and plane-guarded.\nPerforming surveys in the Pacific.\nIn the early 1920s she participated in surveys of various and sundry Pacific islands. In July 1923,\"Whippoorwill\" together with her sister-ship &lt;a href=\"USS%20Tanager%20%28AM-5%29\"&gt;\"Tanager\" (AM-5)&lt;/a&gt; accomplished the first survey of &lt;a href=\"Johnston%20Island\"&gt;Johnston Island&lt;/a&gt; in modern times. During that cruise, she carried members of the &lt;a href=\"Tanager%20Expedition\"&gt;Tanager Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, a joint expedition sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Department%20of%20Agriculture\"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Museum\"&gt;Bishop Museum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;. She also carried a &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20DT\"&gt;Douglas DT&lt;/a&gt;-2 &lt;a href=\"floatplane\"&gt;floatplane&lt;/a&gt; on her fantail, hoisting it into the water so that it could take off for aerial survey and mapping flights over Johnston.\n\"Whippoorwill\" made other cruises, carrying members of ornithological surveys to islands such as &lt;a href=\"Kingman%20Reef\"&gt;Kingman Reef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Palmyra%20Atoll\"&gt;Palmyra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20Island\"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jarvis%20Island\"&gt;Jarvis Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Howland%20Island\"&gt;Howland Island&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baker%20Island\"&gt;Baker Island&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Whippoorwill\" modernized in 1941.\nThe minesweeper departed &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on 5 May 1941, bound for the &lt;a href=\"Asiatic%20Fleet\"&gt;Asiatic Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. En route, the minecraft plane-guarded at prearranged stations, serving as a &lt;a href=\"Radio%20direction%20finder\"&gt;direction-finding station&lt;/a&gt; for patrol planes flying to the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; to reinforce the Asiatic Fleet's air wing\u2014Patrol Wing 10.\nAfter touching briefly at &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Marianas\"&gt;Marianas&lt;/a&gt;, on 23 May, \"Whippoorwill\" reached Manila on the 30th. There, she became part of &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Division\"&gt;Mine Division&lt;/a&gt; 9, &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Squadron\"&gt;Mine Squadron&lt;/a&gt; 3, Asiatic Fleet. In the ensuing months, \"Whippoorwill\" performed a variety of service tasks. She towed targets for the cruisers and destroyers of the Fleet to fire at during battle practices and gunnery shoots, assisted in unmooring and mooring the Fleet's &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"destroyer%20tender\"&gt;destroyer tender&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"buoy\"&gt;buoy&lt;/a&gt;s, and conducted similar activities.\nPhilippine operations.\nThat spring, \"Whippoorwill\" operated with &lt;a href=\"USS%20Canopus%20%28AS-9%29\"&gt;\"Canopus\" (AS-9)&lt;/a&gt; during maneuvers in the southern Philippines, touching at &lt;a href=\"Zamboanga%20City\"&gt;Zamboanga&lt;/a&gt; and steaming in the &lt;a href=\"Sulu%20Sea\"&gt;Sulu Sea&lt;/a&gt;, before returning to &lt;a href=\"Cavite\"&gt;Cavite&lt;/a&gt; and anchoring in Canacao Bay. Soon thereafter, she commenced operations with the Inshore Patrol. \"Whippoorwill\" operated on patrol duties and laid mines\u2014laying the field near &lt;a href=\"Caballo%20Island\"&gt;Caballo Island&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Corregidor\"&gt;Corregidor&lt;/a&gt;, at the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Bay\"&gt;Manila Bay&lt;/a&gt;. She and \"Tanager\" also laid the mine field at &lt;a href=\"Subic%20Bay\"&gt;Subic Bay&lt;/a&gt; while operating out of the section base at &lt;a href=\"Olongapo\"&gt;Olongapo&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter an overhaul at &lt;a href=\"Cavite\"&gt;Cavite&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=\"Verdadero\"&gt;Verdadero&lt;/a&gt; Dockyard across &lt;a href=\"Canacao%20Bay\"&gt;Canacao Bay&lt;/a&gt; from Cavite, \"Whippoorwill\" took up patrol duties in the late autumn, frequently alternating with the gunboats &lt;a href=\"USS%20Asheville%20%28PG-21%29\"&gt;\"Asheville\" (PG-21)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"USS%20Tulsa%20%28PG-22%29\"&gt;\"Tulsa\" (PG-22)&lt;/a&gt;. On 22 November, while on patrol station \"Cast,\" she fired four shots across the bow of the sailing vessel \"Remedio VIII\" before the vessel hove to. She later prevented the Army tug \"Harrison\" from entering the area and warned off other vessels on the 26th and 28th.\nJapanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\nRelieved by \"Tulsa\" on station on 30 November, \"Whippoorwill\" returned to Canacao Bay before she got underway on 3 December for sweeping operations out of Cavite. \nAt 0415 on the 8th, \"Whippoorwill\" received the news of the attack on &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. The ship's &lt;a href=\"commanding%20officer\"&gt;commanding officer&lt;/a&gt;, soon called his crew to quarters and announced the news. Within hours, \"Whippoorwill\" was underway, commencing her first wartime sweeping operations in &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Bay\"&gt;Manila Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder air attack in the Philippines.\nAt 1230 on 10 December, the air raid alert was broadcast at Cavite. At 1250, \"Whippoorwill\" weighed anchor and stood out to maneuver in &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Bay\"&gt;Manila Bay&lt;/a&gt;, away from the confining waters near Cavite itself. Soon the enemy's high-level bombers were droning overhead, above the effective range of the navy yard's 3-inch batteries; every ship in the harbor opened up with their &lt;a href=\"antiaircraft\"&gt;antiaircraft&lt;/a&gt; batteries. In the ensuing action, \"Whippoorwill\" claimed assists in splashing two bombers and sending another one crashing on shore nearby.\n\"Peary\" struck by Japanese bombs.\n&lt;a href=\"USS%20Peary%20%28DD-226%29\"&gt;\"Peary\" (DD-226)&lt;/a&gt; alongside Central Wharf for an overhaul was hit by a bomb that struck the foremast, snapping it off above the searchlight platform and sending shards of metal down onto the bridge and fire-control platform, killing or wounding nearly every man there\u2014including the commander and his &lt;a href=\"executive%20officer\"&gt;executive officer&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, bombs blasted and set afire the &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; warehouse across the wharf; warheads exploded and burned.\nComdr. Ferriter saw \"Peary's\" predicament and moved his ship through the burning navy yard and eased \"Whippoorwill\" near the &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;'s stern and passed a towline. Braving the burning firebrands from the blazing warehouse, the destroyermen made fast the line, and the minesweeper commenced backing. The towline stretched taut\u2014only to part! Twice more Ferriter's command closed the immobile destroyer, both ships endangered by warheads detonating nearby. Finally, on the third try, the line held; and, with debris showering upon the minesweeper and her crippled charge, \"Whippoorwill\" pulled \"Peary\" free.\n\"Whippoorwill\" pulls \"Peary\" out of danger.\nSoon thereafter, \"Whippoorwill\" moored \"Peary\" to a buoy in &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Bay\"&gt;Manila Bay&lt;/a&gt; and took the destroyer's wounded to the hospital at &lt;a href=\"Sangley%20Point\"&gt;Sangley Point&lt;/a&gt; in her motor launch. Later that evening, the minesweeper unmoored from the &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; and stood out, anchoring for the night farther out in Manila Bay.\n\"Whippoorwill\" escapes to Borneo.\nWith Philippine waters vulnerable for surface ships, those ships of the Asiatic Fleet that could do so sailed for points south. \"Whippoorwill\" headed for &lt;a href=\"Borneo\"&gt;Borneo&lt;/a&gt; on 12 December and arrived at &lt;a href=\"Balikpapan\"&gt;Balikpapan&lt;/a&gt; on the 15th. Four days later, the minecraft\u2014in company with \"Tulsa\", \"Asheville\", and &lt;a href=\"USS%20Lark%20%28AM-21%29\"&gt;\"Lark\" (AM-21)&lt;/a&gt;\u2014joined &lt;a href=\"Task%20Force\"&gt;Task Force&lt;/a&gt; (TF) 7 and withdrew further south to the &lt;a href=\"Sulawesi\"&gt;Celebes&lt;/a&gt;, arriving the next day. Later, \"Whippoorwill\" screened \"Tulsa\" as the two ships proceeded for &lt;a href=\"Java\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;.\nArriving at &lt;a href=\"Surabaya\"&gt;Surabaya&lt;/a&gt;, three days before &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; of 1941, Comdr. Ferriter went ashore and reported for orders to the Dutch naval commander there. Three days later, the minesweeper commenced local patrols and sweeps out of Surabaya and continued that duty into February 1942, often operating in company with Dutch units, before she received orders to move to &lt;a href=\"Tjilatjap\"&gt;Tjilatjap&lt;/a&gt;, a port on &lt;a href=\"Java\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;'s south coast.\nSearching for \"Langley\u2019s\" survivors.\nArriving early on 26 February, \"Whippoorwill\" and \"Lark\" put to sea at 1400 the next day to search for survivors of the &lt;a href=\"seaplane%20tender\"&gt;seaplane tender&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"USS%20Langley%20%28AV-3%29\"&gt;\"Langley\" (AV-3)&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly sunk south of Java. Three hours out of Tjilatjap, the minesweeper's lookouts sighted a strange vessel and altered course to close and identify her. The mysterious ship turned out to be \"Tulsa\", also searching for \"Langley\" survivors.\nThe trio of ships continued their search, the minesweepers steaming independently of the gunboat. At 2229, \"Whippoorwill\" and \"Lark\" arrived in the area in which \"Langley\" had been reported lost, passed a large oil slick, and smelled a strong odor of gasoline and oil\u2014mute testimony to the tragedy that had gone before.\nRescuing survivors of the \"SS City of Manchester\".\nOn the following day, the last day of February, the minesweepers abandoned their search and were about to put about to return to Tjilatjap. At 0507, however, lookouts noted a pulsating fire on the horizon; and the minesweepers closed cautiously. The burning vessel turned out to be the British merchantman \"City of Manchester\"\u2014of the Ellerman Line\u2014that had been torpedoed and gunned by the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20submarine%20I-153\"&gt;Japanese submarine \"I-153\"&lt;/a&gt;. \"Whippoorwill\" lowered a boat at 0550 and rescued the British sailors from their rafts and life boats. Ten injured men were transferred to \"Tulsa\", which had also arrived on the scene of the rescue\u2014the gunboat having a well-equipped sick bay that the minesweepers lacked.\nFollowing that rescue mission, \"Whippoorwill\" returned to &lt;a href=\"Tjilatjap\"&gt;Tjilatjap&lt;/a&gt;, arriving on 1 March, only to stand out later that day as Java, too, was becoming more untenable with each passing hour. Subsequently \"Whippoorwill\" crept southward towards Australia.\n\"Whippoorwill\" makes it to Australia.\n\"Whippoorwill\" dropped anchor at &lt;a href=\"Fremantle%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Fremantle&lt;/a&gt; on 9 March and operated out of Fremantle into May before she shifted to &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt;. The minesweeper conducted local patrols and guardship operations in the shipping channels and harbors there from mid-May to late August when she returned to Fremantle. For the remainder of 1942, \"Whippoorwill\" operated alternatively at &lt;a href=\"Exmouth%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Exmouth Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Albany, or Fremantle, patrolling locally and towing targets. On occasion, she acted as reference vessel for &lt;a href=\"submarines\"&gt;submarines&lt;/a&gt; of the Southwest Pacific forces on their training cruises. The beginning of 1943 found \"Whippoorwill\" engaged in local patrol operations out of &lt;a href=\"Exmouth%20Gulf\"&gt;Exmouth Gulf&lt;/a&gt;, and she continued that duty until February, when she made another brief visit to Fremantle. On 18 and 19 February 1943, she engaged in night exercises with American &lt;a href=\"submarines\"&gt;submarines&lt;/a&gt; on maneuvers. Six days later, while underway off the coast, she encountered a &lt;a href=\"cyclone\"&gt;cyclone&lt;/a&gt; which wrenched two 300-pound &lt;a href=\"depth%20charges\"&gt;depth charges&lt;/a&gt; from their tracks.\nAntisubmarine action.\nAfter returning to Exmouth Gulf, she remained there through March 1943 before sailing for Fremantle and a six-day &lt;a href=\"drydock\"&gt;drydock&lt;/a&gt;ing period. Upon completion of this brief refit, she returned to Exmouth Gulf on 24 April and conducted minesweeping operations in the area. On 15 May, while en route to Fremantle, she picked up an echo with her &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt; gear and came to &lt;a href=\"general%20quarters\"&gt;general quarters&lt;/a&gt;. She dropped &lt;a href=\"depth%20charges\"&gt;depth charges&lt;/a&gt; but lost the contact. Arriving at Fremantle two days later, 17 May, she commenced a series of &lt;a href=\"antisubmarine\"&gt;antisubmarine&lt;/a&gt; patrols which lasted into November.\nReclassified as an ocean-going tug.\nOn 1 December, she began an extensive refit. During the yard work, she was reclassified an ocean-going tug and redesignated AT-169 on 1 March 1944. The long overhaul was completed on 5 March, and the ship proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Brisbane\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;.\nComing under the operational control of &lt;a href=\"Commander%2C%20Service%20Force%2C%207th%20Fleet\"&gt;Commander, Service Force, 7th Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, \"Whippoorwill\" arrived at Brisbane on 20 March. For the next 10 days, 21 to 31 March 1944, she underwent final conversion to an ocean-going tug. This involved the removal of her minesweeping gear and the addition of a heavy-duty towing engine which had once been fitted on board &lt;a href=\"USS%20Dobbin%20%28AD-3%29\"&gt;\"Dobbin\" (AD-3)&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Guinea operations.\nOn 8 April, the newly refitted \"Whippoorwill\" with \"LST-385\" under tow, got underway for &lt;a href=\"New%20Guinea\"&gt;New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, and arrived at &lt;a href=\"Milne%20Bay\"&gt;Milne Bay&lt;/a&gt; with her charge on 15 April. The tug then served &lt;a href=\"Jayapura\"&gt;Hollandia&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Mios%20Woendi\"&gt;Mios Woendi&lt;/a&gt;; also receiving orders to &lt;a href=\"Seeadler%20Harbor\"&gt;Seeadler Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Admiralty%20Islands\"&gt;Admiralty Islands&lt;/a&gt;, to serve on \"battle-damage standby\" duty\u2014prepared to take any battle-damaged ships under tow and out of the front lines.\nPhilippine Islands operations.\n\"Whippoorwill\" was reclassified an ocean-going tug, old, on 15 May 1944 and designated ATO-169. She then continued operations off &lt;a href=\"New%20Guinea\"&gt;New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; and in the backwater areas of the war in the Pacific until receiving orders to head north for &lt;a href=\"Leyte\"&gt;Leyte&lt;/a&gt; in February 1945. Later operating at &lt;a href=\"Jayapura\"&gt;Hollandia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulithi\"&gt;Ulithi&lt;/a&gt;, \"Whippoorwill\" resumed operations in the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Islands\"&gt;Philippine Islands&lt;/a&gt; on 15 June 1945 and served as a harbor tug in the &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Bay\"&gt;Manila Bay&lt;/a&gt; area through the end of the war.\nTouching at &lt;a href=\"Leyte%20Gulf\"&gt;Leyte Gulf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Bay\"&gt;Manila Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zamboanga%20City\"&gt;Zamboanga&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Samar\"&gt;Samar&lt;/a&gt;, \"Whippoorwill\" finally rounded out her tour in the Philippine Islands on 20 December, when she departed Samar, bound for the &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Islands\"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving at &lt;a href=\"Eniwetok\"&gt;Eniwetok&lt;/a&gt; in company with &lt;a href=\"USS%20Vireo%20%28ATO-144%29\"&gt;\"Vireo\" (ATO-144)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"USS%20Rail%20%28ATO-139%29\"&gt;\"Rail\" (ATO-139)&lt;/a&gt;, she departed that island on 4 January 1946, bound for &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, arriving at the Pacific base that had once long served as her home port on the 15th. After a 10-day stay, \"Whippoorwill\" in company with \"Rail\", got underway again on 25 January, and headed for &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, California.\nPost-war inactivation and decommissioning.\nArriving there on 5 February 1946, \"Whippoorwill\" soon began preparation for inactivation and, on 17 April 1946, the ship was decommissioned at &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, California. Struck from the &lt;a href=\"Navy%20list\"&gt;Navy list&lt;/a&gt; on 10 June 1946, she was turned over to the &lt;a href=\"Maritime%20Commission\"&gt;Maritime Commission&lt;/a&gt; for disposal on 6 November 1946.\nMilitary awards and honors.\n\"Whippoorwill\" was awarded one &lt;a href=\"battle%20star\"&gt;battle star&lt;/a&gt; for her &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; service."
