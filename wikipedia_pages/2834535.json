    "text": "Lost in the Fog Save the Day (February 4, 2002 \u2013 September 17, 2006) was an American &lt;a href=\"thoroughbred\"&gt;thoroughbred&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"race%20horse\"&gt;race horse&lt;/a&gt;. He won his first 10 starts (including two &lt;a href=\"Breeders%27%20Cup\"&gt;Breeders' Cup&lt;/a&gt; stakes), 11 of his 14 lifetime starts across the country, and career earnings of $978,099. He died of &lt;a href=\"lymphoma\"&gt;lymphoma&lt;/a&gt; during his four-year-old season and his remains were buried at &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Gate%20Fields\"&gt;Golden Gate Fields&lt;/a&gt; next to &lt;a href=\"Silky%20Sullivan\"&gt;Silky Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBloodlines.\nBred by Susan Seper and foaled in &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, his sire was Lost Soldier, (sire of 10 stakes winners and son of &lt;a href=\"Danzig%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Danzig&lt;/a&gt;, who was the son of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Dancer\"&gt;Northern Dancer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014ranked #43 by &lt;a href=\"The%20Blood-Horse%20magazine\"&gt;The Blood-Horse&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"Blood-Horse%20magazine%20List%20of%20the%20Top%20100%20Racehorses%20of%20the%2020th%20Century\"&gt;top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century&lt;/a&gt;). His dam was Cloud Break, a Dr. Carter mare. Unraced, Cloud Break is proving a successful broodmare; she also produced the stakes-placed How About My Place, by Out of Place. In foal to Speightstown, Cloud Break was acquired by &lt;a href=\"WinStar%20Farm\"&gt;WinStar Farm&lt;/a&gt; in 2005's &lt;a href=\"Fasig-Tipton\"&gt;Fasig-Tipton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kentucky\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; November mixed sale for $600,000. In 2006, she was sold to Charles Deter. He was a descendant of War Admiral and Secretariat.\nLost in the Fog was a $13,000 &lt;a href=\"weanling\"&gt;weanling&lt;/a&gt; and a $48,000 &lt;a href=\"Yearling%20%28horse%29\"&gt;yearling&lt;/a&gt;. Not reaching his reserve in the 2004 two-year-old &lt;a href=\"Ocala%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Ocala, Florida&lt;/a&gt; Breeders' Sale in March (the stopping price was $195,000), he was sold privately for $140,000 to Harry Aleo, and throughout his short career was trained by Greg Gilchrist. Susan Seper said he was named the day she (literally) lost him in the fog.\nCareer.\nWinning streak.\nLost in the Fog's home track was the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area\"&gt;San Francisco Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Gate%20Fields\"&gt;Golden Gate Fields&lt;/a&gt;. In 2005, competing solely in &lt;a href=\"graded%20stakes%20race\"&gt;stakes&lt;/a&gt; company (with the exception of his maiden), he won the &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Sprint%20Horse\"&gt;Eclipse Award for Outstanding Sprint Horse&lt;/a&gt;. He won 10 straight races, although his hopes of becoming the 2005 &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Award%20for%20Horse%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year&lt;/a&gt; winner were dashed on October 29, 2005 when he finished seventh in the &lt;a href=\"Breeders%27%20Cup%20Sprint\"&gt;Breeders' Cup Sprint&lt;/a&gt;. After the Breeders' Cup, Lost in the Fog took six months off. Prior to that he was unbeaten, with a string of 10 sprint victories (short races\u2014six or seven &lt;a href=\"furlong\"&gt;furlong&lt;/a&gt;s on the dirt). Because of his success, he never went off at long &lt;a href=\"odds\"&gt;odds&lt;/a&gt;; indeed, he was favored in every lifetime start.\nComeback.\nThe colt lost his first 2006 start, finishing second behind Carthage in the April 22 Oakland Tribune Golden Gate Fields Sprint.\nOn June 3, 2006, Lost in the Fog returned to his winning ways for a final time with a victory in the six-furlong &lt;a href=\"graded%20stakes%20race\"&gt;Grade 3&lt;/a&gt; Aristides Breeders' Cup Handicap at &lt;a href=\"Churchill%20Downs\"&gt;Churchill Downs&lt;/a&gt; (named for &lt;a href=\"Aristides%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Aristides&lt;/a&gt;, the little horse who won the first &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Derby\"&gt;Kentucky Derby&lt;/a&gt;). Carrying high weight of 124 pounds and ridden by &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Baze\"&gt;Russell Baze&lt;/a&gt;, Lost in the Fog won the $69,024 winner's share of the purse and set a new stakes record. The Aristides was his 10th stakes victory. His final start was the &lt;a href=\"Smile%20Sprint%20Handicap\"&gt;Smile Sprint Handicap&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Calder%20Race%20Course\"&gt;Calder&lt;/a&gt; on July 15, 2006, in which the colt finished ninth. This puzzling result suggested to observers that something was wrong with the horse.\nRaces.\nAverage win margin when undefeated: 6 3/4 lengths\nNote: The Ocala Stud Dash Stakes is also known as the Sunshine Millions Dash as part of the Sunshine Millions series for Florida-bred and California-bred horses.\nCancer.\nIn August 2006, believing Lost in the Fog to be suffering from a mild bout of &lt;a href=\"horse%20colic\"&gt;colic&lt;/a&gt;, his handlers took him to the &lt;a href=\"UC%20Davis%20School%20of%20Veterinary%20Medicine\"&gt;California-Davis veterinary school&lt;/a&gt;. Performing a biopsy on the horse, the doctors discovered what they believed to be a cancerous mass on his spleen - a &lt;a href=\"Lymphoma%20in%20animals\"&gt;lymphoma&lt;/a&gt; \"about the size of a cantaloupe.\" The doctors thought that surgery was likely, a rare operation but possibly one that could give Lost in the Fog a full life.\nGilchrist, his trainer, had thought that his horse's recent poor performances\u2014winning only one of three starts this year\u2014might have been due to &lt;a href=\"quarter%20crack\"&gt;quarter crack&lt;/a&gt;s. \"It turns out he's been running with this thing inside him this year,\" he said. \"It shows you what kind of warrior this horse is.\" He also said that owner Harry Aleo was extremely concerned about his star. \"We will do anything we can for the horse. It's almost a &lt;a href=\"Barbaro%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Barbaro&lt;/a&gt;-type situation.\"\nOn August 18, the situation worsened. According to a report in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Blood-Horse\"&gt;The Blood-Horse&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Two additional tumors were discovered. The first, the size of an egg, was located in the membrane that suspends the spleen. The second, ...as large as the growth found originally on the spleen, is beneath (the horse's) spine along his back, very intimately against the body wall. It could not be removed surgically\". Given the circumstances, Gilchrist said it would not be proper to extend Lost in the Fog's life beyond the horse's comfort level or subject him to chemotherapy or extensive surgery. \"We'll keep him in the stall for a week or 10 days,\" the trainer said. \"This would be the best thing to do, get him back with his groom. I just couldn't leave him up there (at Davis) to be euthanized and thrown in the bone yard. We're fine with a week, 10 days, maybe two weeks,\" he said. \"But you get beyond that, his quality of life wouldn't be good. This way we'll let the people who have always been around him take care of him. We'll bring him home and make him as happy as we can for a while\".\nDeath.\nLost in the Fog was vanned back to his stall at Golden Gate Fields, where he was pampered for his remaining days. On September 17, 2006, he was quietly &lt;a href=\"animal%20euthanasia\"&gt;euthanized&lt;/a&gt;. The colt had been grazing, as he had done twice each day since the discovery of his cancer, when Gilcrist saw he was in obvious distress and ordered him to be euthanized. He said that Lost in the Fog was happy and peaceful until the end. An autopsy on Lost in the Fog revealed that the cancer was much more widespread than previously thought. An article in \"The Blood-Horse\" noted, \"Located directly below his spine, one inoperable lymphoma ran almost the length of the colt's back. Doctors at University of California at Davis, where the necropsy also was performed, originally thought that tumor to be about one foot long. 'It went all the way from his pelvis to invade and erode his diaphragm and chest cavity', said Dr. David Wilson, director of UCD's large-animal clinic, who was part of a team of veterinarians and specialists who worked with the horse. 'It also involved his arteries, kidneys and intestinal organs. It actually invaded one kidney and compressed both. It came right up against his aorta', Wilson added. \"He had experienced swelling in his hind legs and that was no doubt caused by the tumors pressing on blood vessels'. In earlier tests, the large tumor had been partially hidden from view by other organs.\" In addition to the primary growth, Lost in the Fog bore a football-sized tumor in his spleen.\nHarry Aleo was astounded that Lost in the Fog could perform at such a high level before his cancer was diagnosed. Doctors told the owner that the tumors could have been growing for up to a year. Only weeks before his death, however, the horse continued to record bullet workouts at Golden Gate. Lost in the Fog's remains were cremated. There had been discussion of their going to Greg and Karen Dodd's Southern Chase Farm in &lt;a href=\"Williston%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Williston, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, where he was raised. However, arrangements were made for the colt's ashes to be buried at Golden Gate Fields where he was stabled. He is buried next to &lt;a href=\"Silky%20Sullivan\"&gt;Silky Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nLost in the Fog Stakes.\nOn September 30, 2006, Golden Gate Fields celebrated Lost in the Fog's life. In 2007, the track hosted the inaugural &lt;a href=\"Lost%20in%20the%20Fog%20%28Sprint%29\"&gt;Lost in the Fog Stakes&lt;/a&gt;, a five-furlong sprint for two-year-olds:\nDocumentary.\nA documentary, \"Lost in the Fog\", was produced by John Corey for release in 2008. The film made its world premiere at the CineVegas Film Festival in June 2008, where it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary. The Film was also nominated as Best First Feature at IDFA, the International Documentary Festival of Amsterdam."
