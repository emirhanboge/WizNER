During the war he held various positions and was in command of some squadrons of the Naval Air Auxiliary Service, distinguishing himself for courage and technical ability.\nIn the spring of 1917 he was in command of the 258th Squadron, equipped with &lt;a href=\"FBA%20Type%20H\"&gt;FBA Type H&lt;/a&gt; aircraft, embarked on the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20seaplane%20carrier%20Europa\"&gt;seaplane carrier Europa&lt;/a&gt;, and in June of the same year he was transferred to the 253rd Squadron, of which he assumed command on the following 5 August. From 19 January 1918 he commanded the 264th Squadron stationed in &lt;a href=\"Ancona\"&gt;Ancona&lt;/a&gt;, also equipped with FBA aircraft. On June 3, two Austro-Hungarian seamen of Italian origin decided to desert and stole a &lt;a href=\"Lohner%20L\"&gt;Lohner L&lt;/a&gt; seaplane, which they flew across the Adriatic Sea, landing near &lt;a href=\"Fano\"&gt;Fano&lt;/a&gt;, where they were captured; Pellegrini, along with &lt;a href=\"sub-lieutenant\"&gt;sub-lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Briganti\"&gt;Alberto Briganti&lt;/a&gt;, was sent from Ancona with the task of recovering the aircraft.

In July 1927 he became a &lt;a href=\"colonel\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt; and shortly after he took part in an inspection flight over the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Italo%20Balbo\"&gt;Italo Balbo&lt;/a&gt; and engineer Ettore Alberi, in preparation for Balbo's planned mass air cruises over the western and eastern Mediterranean, that would take place in 1928 and 1929. Pellegrini himself was chosen by Balbo as flying commander for he Eastern Mediterranean Air Cruise of 1929; this choice led to a final break-up between Balbo and &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20De%20Pinedo\"&gt;Francesco De Pinedo&lt;/a&gt;, who expected to be chosen instead.\nIn September 1929 Pellegrini was promoted to the rank of air brigade general (equivalent to &lt;a href=\"air%20commodore\"&gt;air commodore&lt;/a&gt;), and in May 1931, after the sudden death of Lieutenant Colonel Umberto Maddalena, he assumed the position of commander of the High-Seas Air Navigation School of &lt;a href=\"Orbetello\"&gt;Orbetello&lt;/a&gt;; in this capacity he collaborated in the realization of Balbo's Italy-&lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; air cruise (December 17, 1930 \u2013 January 15, 1931).

On this occasion he personally flew a &lt;a href=\"Savoia-Marchetti%20S.55X\"&gt;Savoia-Marchetti S.55X&lt;/a&gt; seaplane. Later in 1933 he replaced Manlio Molfese as head of division at the head of the Civil Aviation Directorate of the Ministry of Air Force (\"Civilavia\").\nIn view of Italy's entry into &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, on 16 May 1940 he assumed the position of commander of the 3rd Air Fleet, with headquarters in Rome. After the signing of the &lt;a href=\"armistice%20of%20Villa%20Incisa\"&gt;armistice of Villa Incisa&lt;/a&gt; with France, on June 26 he assumed the position of Vice-President of the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Armistice%20Commission%20with%20France\"&gt;Italian Armistice Commission with France&lt;/a&gt; (\"Commissione Italiana di Armistizio con la Francia\", CIAF).\nOn 28 June he participated in the first meeting of the Armistice Commission, in which sub-commissions were created to deal with general issues and issues relating to the &lt;a href=\"French%20army\"&gt;French army&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marine%20Nationale\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"French%20Air%20Force\"&gt;air force&lt;/a&gt;. On July 20, 1940, he was elevated to the rank of air fleet general (equivalent to &lt;a href=\"air%20marshal\"&gt;air marshal&lt;/a&gt;). On 7 December 1940 he took off from Rome aboard a &lt;a href=\"Savoia-Marchetti%20S.79\"&gt;Savoia-Marchetti S.79&lt;/a&gt; together with General &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Pintor\"&gt;Pietro Pintor&lt;/a&gt;, to reach the CIAF headquarters of in &lt;a href=\"Turin\"&gt;Turin&lt;/a&gt;, but the plane crashed in &lt;a href=\"Cartosio\"&gt;Cartosio&lt;/a&gt;, on the border between the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Savona\"&gt;Savona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alessandria\"&gt;Alessandria&lt;/a&gt;, killing everyone aboard."
