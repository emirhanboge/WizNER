Kiryat Haim is within the municipal borders of the city of Haifa, and lies on the shore of the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nKiryat Haim, founded in 1933, was named after &lt;a href=\"Haim%20Arlosoroff\"&gt;Haim Arlosoroff&lt;/a&gt;, who was assassinated that year. Kibbutz &lt;a href=\"Kfar%20Masaryk\"&gt;Kfar Masaryk&lt;/a&gt;, formed in &lt;a href=\"Petah%20Tikva\"&gt;Petah Tikva&lt;/a&gt; in 1932 and originally known \"Czecho-Lita,\" moved to &lt;a href=\"Bat%20Galim\"&gt;Bat Galim&lt;/a&gt; in 1933 and then to the &lt;a href=\"sand%20dunes\"&gt;sand dunes&lt;/a&gt; of Kiryat Haim, west of the railway. The kibbutz raised vegetables and opened a dairy farm. At this point it adopted a new name: \"Mishmar Zevulun\" (Guardian of &lt;a href=\"Zevulun%20Valley\"&gt;Zevulun Valley&lt;/a&gt;).\nAdministratively, Kiryat Haim is divided into two parts, Kiryat Haim West and Kiryat Haim East. Kiryat Haim West is located on the western side of the railway line between that and Kiryat Haim beach.\nKiryat Haim East was expanded to later and is located on the eastern side of railway. The housing initially consisted of low-density single-family housing, with a number of public housing projects located at edge of the neighbourhood.
