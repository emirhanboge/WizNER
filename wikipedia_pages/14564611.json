    "text": "Brian Allison (born 23 June 1988) in &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; is a Scottish &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28football%29\"&gt;defender&lt;/a&gt;, who plays for &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Stirling Albion&lt;/a&gt;.\nFootball career.\nAllison made his d\u00e9but for &lt;a href=\"Falkirk%20F.C.\"&gt;Falkirk&lt;/a&gt; on 29 September 2007 against &lt;a href=\"Inverness%20Caledonian%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Inverness Caledonian Thistle&lt;/a&gt;. Allison made another appearance for the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;SPL&lt;/a&gt; outfit before going on loan to &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Stirling Albion&lt;/a&gt; in the January 2008 transfer window. Allison was initially placed on a one-month loan deal, with the possibility to extend until the end of the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;. Alison made his d\u00e9but for Stirling Albion against &lt;a href=\"St%20Johnstone%20F.C.\"&gt;St Johnstone&lt;/a&gt; on 26 January 2008. Allison scored his first professional career goal in Stirling Albion's match against &lt;a href=\"Partick%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Partick Thistle&lt;/a&gt; on 9 February 2008. A second loan spell with Stirling followed in 2010, before he joined them on a permanent basis after his release from Falkirk at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;2009-10 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis second goal made headline news across Scotland, as it was scored in a 1\u20130 win against &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; on 6 October 2012. Stirling Albion became the first &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt; club to beat &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; since they were admitted to play in Scotland's lowest league. The result was even more remarkable as the Stirling Albion manager was absent, getting married. After the match, British based gambling company &lt;a href=\"Ladbrokes\"&gt;Ladbrokes&lt;/a&gt; revealed Allison's goal against Rangers saved the bookies about \u00a35 million"
