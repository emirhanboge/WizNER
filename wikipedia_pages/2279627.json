    "text": "Jacques Touchard (1885\u20131968) was a &lt;a href=\"French%20people\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mathematician\"&gt;mathematician&lt;/a&gt;. In 1953, he proved that an odd &lt;a href=\"perfect%20number\"&gt;perfect number&lt;/a&gt; must be of the form 12\"k\"\u00a0+\u00a01 or 36\"k\"\u00a0+\u00a09. In &lt;a href=\"combinatorics\"&gt;combinatorics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"probability%20theory\"&gt;probability theory&lt;/a&gt;, he introduced the &lt;a href=\"Touchard%20polynomials\"&gt;Touchard polynomials&lt;/a&gt;. He is also known for his solution to the &lt;a href=\"m%C3%A9nage%20problem\"&gt;m\u00e9nage problem&lt;/a&gt; of counting seating arrangements in which men and women alternate and are not seated next to their spouses.\nTouchard's Catalan identity.\nThe following algebraic identity involving the &lt;a href=\"Catalan%20number\"&gt;Catalan number&lt;/a&gt;s\nis apparently due to Touchard (according to &lt;a href=\"Richard%20P.%20Stanley\"&gt;Richard P.
