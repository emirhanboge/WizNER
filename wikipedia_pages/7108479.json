In 1979 \"Novi kvadrat\" won the prestigious national award \"7 sekretara SKOJ-a\", thus marking a break-up of the group.\nSLS studio.\nAt the beginning of the eighties Kordej teams-up with &lt;a href=\"Mirko%20Ili%C4%87\"&gt;Mirko Ili\u0107&lt;/a&gt; again in SLS studio (acronym for \"Slow, Bad and Expensive\"), and focuses on producing album covers and posters for Yugoslavian pop musicians and groups. After the break-up with Ili\u0107 he continues with solo career, doing illustration for Yugoslavian mainstream magazines, film and theater posters, logotypes and album covers.\nEarly international work.\nHe started a career in European comic market in 1986 (France, Spain, Germany), and since 1989 on the US market (&lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Metal%20Magazine\"&gt;Heavy Metal Magazine&lt;/a&gt;). His most significant work from that period is album \"Les cinq saisons \u2013 Automne\", published in 1990 by &lt;a href=\"Dargaud\"&gt;Dargaud&lt;/a&gt;. That album was appointed by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Culture%20%28France%29\"&gt;Ministry of Culture in France&lt;/a&gt; as a work of significant cultural value and was assigned to all public libraries in France (in 2011 the same album was featured in &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Gravett\"&gt;Paul Gravett&lt;/a&gt;'s book \"1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die\").\nKordej moves from Zagreb to a small Istrian village, &lt;a href=\"Groznjan\"&gt;Groznjan&lt;/a&gt; in 1988 where he leads, as an artist and supervisor, a group of over 20 artists and story writers (among others a young &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Macan\"&gt;Darko Macan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edvin%20Biukovi%C4%87\"&gt;Edvin Biukovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goran%20Sud%C5%BEuka\"&gt;Goran Sud\u017euka&lt;/a&gt;), as well as veterans Radovan Devli\u0107 and Dragan Filipovi\u0107 Fipa, producing comics and design for the German market.\nMoving abroad.\nHe moves to &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; in 1991, invited by &lt;a href=\"Semic%20Press\"&gt;Semic International&lt;/a&gt; company, where he spends almost a year, producing comics and illustrations for &lt;a href=\"Malibu%20Comics\"&gt;Malibu Comics&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1997 he moves to &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, invited by &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Chameleon\"&gt;Digital Chameleon&lt;/a&gt; company, working as a creative director. Having disputes with management, he leaves the company after eight months and becomes a &lt;a href=\"freelancer\"&gt;freelancer&lt;/a&gt; again.\nMarvel.\nHis career in &lt;a href=\"Marvel%20Comics\"&gt;Marvel Comics&lt;/a&gt; can be divided in two phases; the first one (when he simultaneously worked for &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horse%20Comics\"&gt;Dark Horse Comics&lt;/a&gt;) is from 1994 to 1996, under editor-in-chief &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20McLaurin\"&gt;Marcus McLaurin&lt;/a&gt;, when Kordej produced several hand-painted comics for \"Tales of Marvels\" series. The second phase began in 2001 when he was invited by editor-in\u2013chief &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Quesada\"&gt;Joe Quesada&lt;/a&gt;, to work on &lt;a href=\"Cable%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Cable&lt;/a&gt; series, as well as &lt;a href=\"New%20X-Men\"&gt;New X-Men&lt;/a&gt; series. Shortly after &lt;a href=\"9/11%20attacks\"&gt;9/11 attacks&lt;/a&gt; many of Marvel artists produced illustrations inspired by the tragedy. They all went on public auction, with all profit given to families of fallen rescuers. Kordey's illustration \"Pennsylvania Plane\" was bought by &lt;a href=\"The%20Library%20of%20Congress\"&gt;The Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt;. Because of his speed as an artist, at his peak, Kordej was producing artwork for three or four monthly books at the same time. However, as a result, he has attracted heavy criticism for the quality of his art, especially from the readers. Eventually he got fired from Marvel in April 2004.\nDelcourt.\nHowever, that event opened up a new chapter in Kordey's career. Just a few months later he signed his first contracts with &lt;a href=\"Delcourt%20%28publisher%29\"&gt;Editions Delcourt&lt;/a&gt;, and his prolific collaboration with that French publisher continued until nowadays. In a period of fifteen years, producing 4-5 albums per year, concluding with 2019 he published close to seventy albums on francophone market, out of which only series sold out over 1,000.000 copies.\nIn 2006 he moves back to his homeland.\nStyle and recognition.\nThroughout all those years Kordej continued to produce graphic design and illustrations for both francophone and ex-Yugoslavian region markets, occasionally doing illustrations for US comics market.\nHe has a very diverse repertoire, moving between traditional pencils and inks to fully painted panels, using &lt;a href=\"watercolors\"&gt;watercolors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gouache\"&gt;gouache&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis works are collected, among others, in &lt;a href=\"The%20Library%20of%20Congress\"&gt;The Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LucasFilm\"&gt;LucasFilm&lt;/a&gt; (CA) and &lt;a href=\"MoMa\"&gt;MoMa&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Museum od Modern Art (NY).\nBibliography.\nInterior comic work includes:"
