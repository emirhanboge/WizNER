    "text": "Hurricane Hilda was an intense &lt;a href=\"tropical%20cyclone\"&gt;tropical cyclone&lt;/a&gt; that ravaged areas of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Gulf%20Coast\"&gt;United States Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to its damage inland, the hurricane greatly disrupted offshore oil production, and at its time was the costliest tropical cyclone for Louisiana's offshore oil production. Due in part to flights made by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Hurricane%20Research%20Laboratory\"&gt;National Hurricane Research Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, Hilda became one of the most well-documented storms meteorologically in the Atlantic. Lasting for seven days as a tropical cyclone, Hilda caused US$126\u00a0million in damage and 38\u00a0deaths. It was the tenth &lt;a href=\"named%20storm\"&gt;named storm&lt;/a&gt;, sixth hurricane, and the fourth &lt;a href=\"major%20hurricane\"&gt;major hurricane&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"1964%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season\"&gt;1964 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;.\nHilda developed over the southern shores of &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; on September\u00a028 as a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20depression\"&gt;tropical depression&lt;/a&gt;, tracking westward in an area of favorable conditions and reaching &lt;a href=\"tropical%20storm\"&gt;tropical storm&lt;/a&gt; intensity the next day. Once situated in the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, Hilda strengthened into a hurricane and began a slow trawl northward, &lt;a href=\"rapid%20deepening\"&gt;rapidly intensifying&lt;/a&gt; to its peak intensity with &lt;a href=\"maximum%20sustained%20wind\"&gt;winds&lt;/a&gt; of 140\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a01, making it a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Category%204%20Atlantic%20hurricanes\"&gt;Category\u00a04 hurricane&lt;/a&gt; equivalent. Slight weakening occurred as Hilda made &lt;a href=\"landfall%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;landfall&lt;/a&gt; on the southern Louisiana coast on October\u00a03. After reaching land, the hurricane took a sharp turn eastward and rapidly weakened as a result of land interaction and the presence of cool, dry air. The weakened remnants of Hilda merged with a &lt;a href=\"cold%20front\"&gt;cold front&lt;/a&gt; a day after landfall and dissipated on October\u00a05.\nOriginating near Cuba, the cyclone intensified while moving through the Gulf of Mexico, and became a Category\u00a04 hurricane in the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; before striking &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; in early October. In combination with a &lt;a href=\"weather%20front\"&gt;frontal zone&lt;/a&gt; located across the Southeast &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the hurricane spread heavy rains through the South through the Carolinas into the &lt;a href=\"Mid-Atlantic%20States\"&gt;Mid-Atlantic States&lt;/a&gt;. Hilda led to significant damage to oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as $126\u00a0million (1964\u00a0USD) in damage, and 38 deaths.\nMeteorological history.\nThe origins of Hilda can be definitively traced back to a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20wave\"&gt;tropical wave&lt;/a&gt; that trekked across the western &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean Sea&lt;/a&gt; during the last week of September. However, a loosely defined mass of clouds east of the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Antilles\"&gt;Lesser Antilles&lt;/a&gt; on September\u00a023 was potentially associated with the formation of Hilda. Tracking westward, the area of &lt;a href=\"convection%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;convection&lt;/a&gt; gradually intensified, with hints at a well-defined circulation as the system tracked over &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt; on September\u00a027. By 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a028, the disturbance had become sufficiently defined to be classified as a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20depression\"&gt;tropical depression&lt;/a&gt; south of &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. Tracking generally westward, the depression crossed &lt;a href=\"Cape%20San%20Antonio%2C%20Cuba\"&gt;Cape San Antonio, Cuba&lt;/a&gt; on September\u00a029, intensifying to &lt;a href=\"tropical%20storm\"&gt;tropical storm&lt;/a&gt; strength in the meanwhile before moving into the northern &lt;a href=\"Yucat%C3%A1n%20Channel\"&gt;Yucat\u00e1n Channel&lt;/a&gt;. Favorable conditions for &lt;a href=\"tropical%20cyclogenesis\"&gt;tropical cyclone development&lt;/a&gt; in the western Caribbean, including the presence of abnormally high &lt;a href=\"sea%20surface%20temperature\"&gt;sea surface temperature&lt;/a&gt;s, allowed for the further strengthening of Hilda.\nHilda's crossing of western Cuba slightly disrupted the intensification of the tropical cyclone, but strengthening resumed shortly thereafter. Upon reaching the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; later of September\u00a029, Hilda began to track very slowly at an average speed of , later meeting the threshold of hurricane intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030. During that time, atmospheric conditions over the Gulf of Mexico rapidly improved; a preexisting belt of strong &lt;a href=\"wind%20shear\"&gt;wind shear&lt;/a&gt;, which would have inhibited further cyclonic strengthening, disintegrated coincident with Hilda's passage of the gulf. &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20deepening\"&gt;Rapid intensification&lt;/a&gt; ensued on October\u00a01, and by 0600\u00a0UTC that day Hilda became a major hurricane. Twelve hours later, the hurricane reached its peak intensity with &lt;a href=\"maximum%20sustained%20wind\"&gt;maximum sustained wind&lt;/a&gt;s of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a minimum &lt;a href=\"barometric%20pressure\"&gt;barometric pressure&lt;/a&gt; of 941\u00a0&lt;a href=\"bar%20%28unit%29\"&gt;mbar&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"pascal%20%28unit%29\"&gt;hPa&lt;/a&gt;; 27.79\u00a0&lt;a href=\"inches%20of%20mercury\"&gt;inHg&lt;/a&gt;) based on &lt;a href=\"Weather%20reconnaissance\"&gt;reconnaissance flights&lt;/a&gt;. During this phase the storm was centered roughly south of &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;New Orleans, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, an abnormally strong &lt;a href=\"trough%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;trough&lt;/a&gt; centered over &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; began to sharply curve the forward motion of Hilda towards the north.\nFollowing peak intensity, further strengthening was inhibited due to the emergence of a &lt;a href=\"high%20pressure%20area\"&gt;high pressure area&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Gulf%20Coast\"&gt;United States Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt;. The presence of this system injected dry air into Hilda, gradually weakening the hurricane. The once prominent &lt;a href=\"eye%20%28cyclone%29\"&gt;eye&lt;/a&gt; of the storm clouded over as a result of this advection. During the evening hours of October\u00a03, around 23:00\u00a0UTC, Hilda made &lt;a href=\"landfall%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;landfall&lt;/a&gt; on the central &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; coast near &lt;a href=\"Calumet%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Calumet&lt;/a&gt; with a minimum pressure of 959\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.32\u00a0inHg) and maximum sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h), making it equivalent to a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the modern-day &lt;a href=\"Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale\"&gt;Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale&lt;/a&gt;. Rapid weakening followed landfall as a result of the surrounding cold air; by 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04, Hilda had been downgraded to tropical storm intensity. The same area of high pressure which had weakened the tropical cyclone later forced Hilda eastward, resulting in the storm's merging with a &lt;a href=\"cold%20front\"&gt;cold front&lt;/a&gt; and thus transitioning into an &lt;a href=\"extratropical%20cyclone\"&gt;extratropical cyclone&lt;/a&gt; later that day. These extratropical remnants continued to track eastward before they were last noted near &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Jacksonville, Florida&lt;/a&gt; on October\u00a05.\nPreparations.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"tropical%20cyclone%20watches%20and%20warnings\"&gt;hurricane watches or warnings&lt;/a&gt; issued by the Weather Bureau in association with Hilda were issued on October\u00a01, when the agency issued a &lt;a href=\"hurricane%20watch\"&gt;hurricane watch&lt;/a&gt; for the coast of Louisiana to &lt;a href=\"Mobile%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Mobile, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. This prompted the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Department%20of%20Public%20Safety\"&gt;Texas Department of Public Safety&lt;/a&gt; to issue a standby alert for the Texas coast. On October\u00a03, the Weather Bureau upgraded the watch to a &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches\"&gt;hurricane warning&lt;/a&gt;, and expanded it to include the entire &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Coastal%20Bend\"&gt;Texas Coastal Bend&lt;/a&gt; eastward to Mobile, Alabama. As Hilda neared the coast, the scope of the warning was narrowed to include only areas of the Louisiana Gulf Coast eastward to &lt;a href=\"Mobile%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Mobile, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; and a gale warning for an extent of the United States Gulf Coast from &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Bay\"&gt;Mobile Bay&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Panama%20City%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Panama City, Florida&lt;/a&gt;. By the afternoon of October\u00a04, hurricane warnings were lowered but gale warnings remained in place.\nEvacuation of offshore &lt;a href=\"oil%20platform\"&gt;oil platform&lt;/a&gt;s began as early as September\u00a029. The majority of the 2,000\u00a0oil workers were evacuated on September\u00a030 and October\u00a01. Along the United States Gulf Coast, approximately 150,000\u00a0people evacuated. The U.S. &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Civil%20Defense\"&gt;Office of Civil Defense&lt;/a&gt; and three companies of the &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20National%20Guard\"&gt;Louisiana National Guard&lt;/a&gt; were assigned to areas of the coast expedite the evacuation process. Areas lining &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Pontchartrain\"&gt;Lake Pontchartrain&lt;/a&gt; were almost entirely evacuated. Re-purposed &lt;a href=\"boxcar\"&gt;boxcar&lt;/a&gt;s were used to move 3,400\u00a0evacuees northward from New Orleans and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Franklin, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. A mandatory evacuation order was placed for a section of the coast of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Mary%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;St. Mary Parish, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, with shuttle buses assisting in evacuating refugees to &lt;a href=\"Opelousas%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Opelousas, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Red%20Cross\"&gt;United States Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; transported 10,000\u00a0cots to evacuation centers in Opelousas to serve the evacuees. &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20City%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Morgan City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cameron%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Cameron, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; were sites of mass exodus with Hilda approaching the coast. Evacuation out of Cameron was disrupted by the lack of a bridge across the &lt;a href=\"Intracoastal%20Waterway\"&gt;Intracoastal Waterway&lt;/a&gt;, and thus had to be conducted via ferry. Heads of cattle were among those evacuating from &lt;a href=\"Cameron%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Cameron Parish&lt;/a&gt; in fears of a repeat of &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Audrey\"&gt;Hurricane Audrey&lt;/a&gt;, which had killed 35,000\u00a0cattle. Similarly, all residents of &lt;a href=\"Pecan%20Island%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Pecan Island, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; were evacuated. In &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Isle%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Grand Isle, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 80%\u00a0of the population evacuated.\nThough not directly at threat from Hilda, residents of &lt;a href=\"Sabine%20Pass%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Sabine Pass, Texas&lt;/a&gt; were evacuated to nearby towns in fears that roads linking the city to the mainland may be cut off by the hurricane's &lt;a href=\"storm%20surge\"&gt;storm surge&lt;/a&gt;. A permanent off-shore drilling platform offshore of &lt;a href=\"Galveston%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Galveston, Texas&lt;/a&gt; was brought back to shore. Schools along the coast of Louisiana including &lt;a href=\"Nicholls%20State%20University\"&gt;Nicholls State University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tulane\"&gt;Tulane&lt;/a&gt; were suspended in anticipation of the hurricane. In &lt;a href=\"Jackson%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Jackson, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, a federal disaster office was opened to coordinate preparation and relief efforts for &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission\"&gt;United States Atomic Energy Commission&lt;/a&gt; delayed a detonation of a &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20bomb\"&gt;nuclear bomb&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tatum%20Salt%20Dome\"&gt;Tatum Salt Dome&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Hattiesburg%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Hattiesburg&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; scrammed planes from its air stations in &lt;a href=\"Meridian%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Meridian, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; and New Orleans, Louisiana in anticipation of Hilda.\nEffects.\nGulf of Mexico.\nThe &lt;a href=\"motor%20ship\"&gt;motor ship&lt;/a&gt; \"Cornelia B III\", carrying a truck on deck, encountered Hilda's rough surf and winds as it traversed the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the truck being washed overboard. As Hilda tracked northward through the Gulf of Mexico, the storm threatened an estimated $350\u00a0million worth of offshore oil drilling facilities. Hilda would become the most destructive tropical cyclone to Louisiana's offshore oil industry at the time of its impact, accruing losses over $100\u00a0million. Strong winds and heavy surf destroyed thirteen\u00a0oil platforms and damaged five\u00a0beyond repair. All but one of the lost oil rigs were built to withstand a \"&lt;a href=\"return%20period\"&gt;25-year storm&lt;/a&gt;\", with the other constructed to withstand a \"100-year storm\". &lt;a href=\"Oil%20spill\"&gt;Oil spill&lt;/a&gt;s resulting from the affected rigs released 11,869\u00a0&lt;a href=\"oil%20barrel\"&gt;barrels&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"crude%20oil\"&gt;crude oil&lt;/a&gt; into the gulf. Despite widespread evacuation of offshore drilling platforms, the 14\u00a0crewmembers of the \"Ocean Driller\" managed to ride out the storm, at times withstanding winds as high as .\nUnited States Gulf Coast.\nLouisiana.\nThe majority of deaths associated with Hilda in Louisiana were a result of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20tropical%20cyclone-spawned%20tornadoes\"&gt;tornadoes&lt;/a&gt; spawned by the hurricane in its outer peripheral &lt;a href=\"rainband\"&gt;rainband&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"squall\"&gt;squall lines&lt;/a&gt;, which began tracking across the region on October\u00a03. Six tornadoes and two &lt;a href=\"waterspout\"&gt;waterspout&lt;/a&gt;s occurred in Louisiana due to the hurricane. Despite tracking for only near &lt;a href=\"Larose%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Larose, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, a violent F4 tornado killed 22\u00a0people and injured 165\u00a0others, destroying 35\u00a0homes in the process. Automobiles in the path of the twister were also damaged. Debris picked up by the tornado was found away in the &lt;a href=\"Bayou%20Blue%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Coteau-Bayou Blue&lt;/a&gt; area, or 3 miles east of &lt;a href=\"Houma%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Houma&lt;/a&gt;. This was the second of only two violent tornado ever spawned by a hurricane with the first one coming from &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Carla%20tornado%20outbreak\"&gt;Hurricane Carla in 1961&lt;/a&gt;. No other tornado in the state resulted in deaths, though multiple twisters in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;New Orleans metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; caused extensive damage to several automobiles and buildings and injured five. The same tornadoes also knocked down power lines, knocking out &lt;a href=\"power%20outage\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; in localized areas. &lt;a href=\"KLEB\"&gt;KLEB&lt;/a&gt; was knocked off the air as a result of these outages.\nData from the hardest hit areas along the central Louisiana coast remains sparse due to the small population density of the area. &lt;a href=\"Storm%20surge\"&gt;Storm surge&lt;/a&gt; unofficially peaked at at the &lt;a href=\"Point%20Au%20Fer%20Reef%20Light\"&gt;Point Au Fer Reef Light&lt;/a&gt;. At the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;, tides reached as high as above &lt;a href=\"mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;mean sea level&lt;/a&gt;. The strongest wind report was from &lt;a href=\"Franklin%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Franklin, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, where a station clocked sustained winds of . Near the coast in &lt;a href=\"Erath%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Erath&lt;/a&gt;, a high &lt;a href=\"water%20tower\"&gt;water tower&lt;/a&gt; succumbed to Hilda's strong winds and collapsed onto an adjacent town hall where civil defense personnel were operating. The incident resulted in the deaths of eight and six injuries. Although there were no stations to report the intensity of winds in Erath, winds away in &lt;a href=\"Abbeville%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Abbeville&lt;/a&gt; reached . Hilda's sharp curve eastward after landfall and the advection of cold air from the north resulted in gusty winds over the &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; area, causing waves to break and spill over the seawall protecting the city from &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Pontchartrain\"&gt;Lake Pontchartrain&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting waterfront flooding damaged fishing camps and other shoreline property. Elsewhere in southeastern Louisiana, strong winds stripped pecans and other nuts off of trees.\nDespite Hilda's intensity at landfall, much of the damage attributed to the hurricane was a result of heavy rains associated with the storm and its interaction with a nearby frontal boundary. Rainfall caused by the storm peaked at northwest of &lt;a href=\"Jeanerette%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Jeanerette&lt;/a&gt;. The strong winds and rain caused extensive crop damage; 98%\u00a0of Louisiana's sugar crop sustained some measure of damage. Although most of the state's cotton crop was harvested prior to Hilda's landfall, the heavy rains flattened unpicked cotton in southern Louisiana, resulting in US$10\u00a0million in damage. Overall, the effects of Hilda in Louisiana destroyed or heavily damaged nearly 2,600\u00a0residences and inflicted minor damage on an additional 19,000. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Red%20Cross\"&gt;United States Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; estimated that about 5,000\u00a0people were injured and that of those 357\u00a0were hospitalized.\nElsewhere.\nEffects in &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; were minimal, with gusts peaking at near &lt;a href=\"High%20Island%2C%20Texas\"&gt;High Island, Texas&lt;/a&gt; and areas of the state receiving trace amounts of precipitation at most. Damage was limited to the portions of the coast which were hit by a minor storm surge peaking at above &lt;a href=\"mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;mean sea level&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Freeport%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Freeport&lt;/a&gt;. Some piers and arterial beach roads adjacent to the coast were damaged. Portions of &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%2087\"&gt;Texas State Highway 87&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Bolivar%20Peninsula\"&gt;Bolivar Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; were inundated by floodwater. Minor property damage occurred, and no persons were injured in Texas.\nTracking across the southern areas of &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, Hilda and later its remnants brought torrential rainfall to central and southern portions of the state. The &lt;a href=\"McComb-Pike%20County%20Airport\"&gt;McComb-Pike County Airport&lt;/a&gt; received of rain, the highest precipitation total statewide. The heavy rains resulted in record rainfall totals for the month of October in several locations and &lt;a href=\"flash%20flood\"&gt;flash flood&lt;/a&gt;s. However, the majority of damage in the state was a result of strong northerly winds, which caused power outages and was destructive to the state's pecan and corn crops, which had been nearing harvest. Cotton crops that were harvested prior to the passage of Hilda were largely damaged. Power outages knocked out 460\u00a0telephone circuits and over 30,000\u00a0individual telephones. Strong winds also uprooted and felled trees and their limbs in addition to as well as a tall &lt;a href=\"Radio%20masts%20and%20towers\"&gt;radio mast&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Moss%20Point%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Moss Point, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of Hilda, 20\u00a0people were injured and damage exceeded $50,000. Three of those injuries were a result of a tornado which struck areas of &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20River%20County%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Pearl River County&lt;/a&gt;, destroying a home, two barns, and a &lt;a href=\"pumping%20station\"&gt;pumping station&lt;/a&gt;. Across Mississippi, over 14,000\u00a0homes were damaged, of which 3,000\u00a0were either heavily damaged or completely destroyed.\nInteracting with a cold front as it traversed &lt;a href=\"Alabama\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of Hilda caused gusts as strong as in &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baldwin%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Baldwin counties&lt;/a&gt;, downing telecommunication lines, uprooting trees, and shattering windows. Piers lining &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Bay\"&gt;Mobile Bay&lt;/a&gt; were either destroyed or damaged. Five people were injured in those two counties. Strong winds in &lt;a href=\"Russell%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Russell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lee%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Lee counties&lt;/a&gt; damaged or destroyed several buildings, injuring four. In addition to straight-line winds, three tornadoes occurred across six counties in Alabama, with one injuring three people after damaging five homes, a hospital, and a &lt;a href=\"Physical%20plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;. Although rainfall peaked well inland at , damage as a result of rain was limited to the coast, where the combination of high tides and rain resulted in minor coastal inundation. As the remnants of Hilda moved across the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Panhandle\"&gt;Florida Panhandle&lt;/a&gt; on October\u00a04\u20135, rough surf was produced, with high tides causing minor tidal inundation along the Florida coast. One person drowned in the high surf produced by the storm off of &lt;a href=\"Pensacola%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Pensacola, Florida&lt;/a&gt; on October\u00a04. Squalls in western and northern Florida produced heavy rain, with a maximum occurring in &lt;a href=\"Wewahitchka%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Wewahitchka&lt;/a&gt;, which received . The precipitation produced localized flooding in the &lt;a href=\"Tallahassee%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Tallahassee&lt;/a&gt; area. The squalls also produced strong winds, at times gusting to near &lt;a href=\"Pensacola%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Pensacola&lt;/a&gt;. A station at &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Air%20Station%20Pensacola\"&gt;Naval Air Station Pensacola&lt;/a&gt; clocked a gust. These winds caused minor damage limited to uprooted trees and broken limbs.\nUnited States East Coast.\nRainfall from the remnants of Hilda extended as far northeast as &lt;a href=\"Delaware\"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the remnants interacting with a frontal boundary that extended across the United States East Coast. Extremely torrential rains fell over &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, peaking at south of &lt;a href=\"Waynesboro%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Waynesboro&lt;/a&gt;. The largest precipitation totals occurred in the state's northeastern extremities, where widespread totals of or higher were reported. The rains resulted in flash flooding, causing extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure across Georgia. The excess floodwater caused streams to overflow their banks. At least 30\u00a0bridges were washed away by these swollen streams, and several county roads were washed out. The most considerable damage was reported in northeastern Georgia, coincident with the high rainfall totals there. Damage in &lt;a href=\"Rabun%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Rabun County&lt;/a&gt; alone exceeded US$100,000. In addition to infrastructure damage, thousands of acres of farmland were inundated.\nTorrential rainfall continued northeastwards into the &lt;a href=\"Carolinas\"&gt;Carolinas&lt;/a&gt;, with statewide rainfall peaking at and in &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina\"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The rains in North Carolina exacerbated preexisting flood conditions which had previously caused widespread agricultural and infrastructural damage as well as soil erosion. Though not directly a result of Hilda's remnants, they were likely influenced by the storm's interaction with a frontal boundary. Already overflowing rivers and streams rose even further, reaching near-record levels. &lt;a href=\"Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Raleigh&lt;/a&gt; experienced severe flooding, and roughly 4,000\u00a0people were forced to evacuate their homes due to dangerous floodwaters. Two cars in mountainous regions were swept into inundated areas during the floods, resulting in one death. Several tornadoes in six counties were also reported, injuring two. Extensive wind damage was reported in &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Wayne County&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeavy rains in South Carolina from October\u00a04\u20136 resulted in localized flash flooding, particularly near streams. In mountainous regions, runoff from precipitation caused the &lt;a href=\"Keowee%20River\"&gt;Keowee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saluda%20River\"&gt;Saluda&lt;/a&gt;, and tributaries of the &lt;a href=\"Broad%20River%20%28Carolinas%29\"&gt;Broad River&lt;/a&gt; to swell, inundated and causing substantial damage to adjacent agricultural land and roads, in addition to breaching several small dams. The flooding triggered landslides, killing one person. Counties in the coastal plains of South Carolina also experienced farmland, road, and residential damage due to the heavy rains.\nRetirement.\nAfter the season, the name \"Hilda\" was &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20retired%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20names\"&gt;retired&lt;/a&gt;, making it the fourteenth Atlantic tropical cyclone to have its name retired and the third from 1964."
