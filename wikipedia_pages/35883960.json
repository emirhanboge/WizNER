The game televised on RTP1 saw an average view rate of 974,000.\nBackground.\nPorto were appearing in their 28th Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira in which it was their seven consecutive Superta\u00e7a appearance since 2006. Porto went into the match as 18-time winners (1981, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, &lt;a href=\"2009%20Superta%C3%A7a%20C%C3%A2ndido%20de%20Oliveira\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2010%20Superta%C3%A7a%20C%C3%A2ndido%20de%20Oliveira\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2011%20Superta%C3%A7a%20C%C3%A2ndido%20de%20Oliveira\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;). Of their 27 Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira appearances, they had lost nine times (1979, 1985, 1988, 1992, 1995, 1997, 2000, 2007, &lt;a href=\"2008%20Superta%C3%A7a%20C%C3%A2ndido%20de%20Oliveira\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;). Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra were appearing in their first Superta\u00e7a.\nIn Porto's and Acad\u00e9mica's history, the two teams in their entire history had met on 128 different occasions. Porto had accumulated ninety victories whilst Acad\u00e9mica had accumulated sixteen victories. Of those 128 encounters, twenty two of those games had ended in ties. The last meeting between these two teams in domestic league action saw Porto draw with \"The Students\", 1\u20131 at the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20do%20Drag%C3%A3o\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt; in March 2012. The last meeting between these sides in the domestic cup competition saw Acad\u00e9mica defeat the \"Dragons \", 3\u20130 en route to the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal%20Final\"&gt;2012 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal Final&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-match.\nEntry.\n&lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt; qualified for the 2012 Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira by winning the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Primeira%20Liga\"&gt;2011\u201312 Primeira Liga&lt;/a&gt;. They fought off competition from &lt;a href=\"S.L.%20Benfica\"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"S.C.%20Braga\"&gt;Braga&lt;/a&gt; to capture their twenty-sixth league title in their history. Six games from the end of the season, Benfica were one point ahead of Porto. The next four games for each side proved to be vital. From gameweek 24 to 27, Benfica managed seven points from a possible twelve whilst Porto capitalized on Benfica's mistakes of dropping points and managed to capture maximum of 12 points from 12. The pivotal win which clinched Porto the title was a 2\u20130 away win against &lt;a href=\"C.S.%20Mar%C3%ADtimo\"&gt;Mar\u00edtimo&lt;/a&gt;, where the following day Benfica drew their game away to &lt;a href=\"Rio%20Ave%20F.C.\"&gt;Rio Ave&lt;/a&gt; which resulted in Porto capturing their second consecutive league title.\n&lt;a href=\"Associa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Acad%C3%A9mica%20de%20Coimbra%20%E2%80%93%20O.A.F.\"&gt;Acad\u00e9mica&lt;/a&gt; qualified for their very first Superta\u00e7a by winning the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal%20Final\"&gt;2012 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal Final&lt;/a&gt;, beating &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Sporting CP&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the final at the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20Nacional\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio Nacional&lt;/a&gt;. En route to the final, Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra defeated teams from the &lt;a href=\"Primeira%20Liga\"&gt;Primeira Liga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liga%20de%20Honra\"&gt;Liga de Honra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Portuguese Second Division&lt;/a&gt;. Acad\u00e9mica started their cup campaign defeating &lt;a href=\"Clube%20Oriental%20de%20Lisboa\"&gt;Oriental&lt;/a&gt;, 1\u20130. The most notable win en route to the final saw them face their opposition of the 2012 Superta\u00e7a in the fourth round, where they defeated the \"Dragons\", 3\u20130 at the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20Cidade%20de%20Coimbra\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio Cidade de Coimbra&lt;/a&gt;. Following their most notable win in their cup run, they went on to defeat &lt;a href=\"Leix%C3%B5es%20S.C.\"&gt;Leix\u00f5es&lt;/a&gt; 5\u20132 and the &lt;a href=\"C.D.%20Aves\"&gt;Desportivo das Aves&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20132 in the next two rounds. The draw for the semi-finals saw them draw &lt;a href=\"U.D.%20Oliveirense\"&gt;Oliveirense&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20de%20Honra\"&gt;Liga de Honra&lt;/a&gt;. The semi final was contested over two legs with Acad\u00e9mica winning the first game 1\u20130 and drawing the second game at the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20Carlos%20Os%C3%B3rio\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio Carlos Os\u00f3rio&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20132. Acad\u00e9mica would win the semi final 3\u20132 on aggregate and therefore book their place in the cup final for the first time since 1969. A fourth-minute goal from &lt;a href=\"Marinho%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29\"&gt;Marinho&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal%20Final\"&gt;2012 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal Final&lt;/a&gt; saw them capture the &lt;a href=\"Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Ta\u00e7a de Portugal&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 1939.\nOfficials.\nThe match officials for the game were confirmed on 7 August 2012. &lt;a href=\"Oleg%C3%A1rio%20Benqueren%C3%A7a\"&gt;Oleg\u00e1rio Benqueren\u00e7a&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Leiria%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Leiria&lt;/a&gt; was named as &lt;a href=\"referee%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;referee&lt;/a&gt;. Benqueren\u00e7a had previously officiated the 2005 Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira between Benfica and &lt;a href=\"Vit%C3%B3ria%20F.C.\"&gt;Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20Algarve\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio Algarve&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from the Superta\u00e7a, Benqueren\u00e7a had also officiated two &lt;a href=\"Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Ta\u00e7a de Portugal&lt;/a&gt; finals in &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal%23Final\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; between Porto and Sporting CP and in 2002 between Sporting CP and &lt;a href=\"Leix%C3%B5es%20S.C.\"&gt;Leix\u00f5es&lt;/a&gt;. Benqueren\u00e7a was assisted by Jo\u00e3o Santos of &lt;a href=\"Porto%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt; and Lu\u00eds Marcelino of Leiria, while the fourth official was Jorge Tavares of &lt;a href=\"Aveiro%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Aveiro&lt;/a&gt;.\nVenue.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Portuguese Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; announced in June 2012, that the 2012 Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira was to take place at the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20Municipal%20de%20Aveiro\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio Municipal de Aveiro&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aveiro%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Aveiro&lt;/a&gt;. Acad\u00e9mica's &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20Cidade%20de%20Coimbra\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio Cidade de Coimbra&lt;/a&gt; was also considered in contention to host the Superta\u00e7a but was not selected as a result of Acad\u00e9mica qualifying for the competition. The Est\u00e1dio Municipal de Aveiro hosted the Superta\u00e7a competition for a fourth consecutive year in a row after previously hosting the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Superta%C3%A7a%20C%C3%A2ndido%20de%20Oliveira\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2010%20Superta%C3%A7a%20C%C3%A2ndido%20de%20Oliveira\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Superta%C3%A7a%20C%C3%A2ndido%20de%20Oliveira\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; editions of the Superta\u00e7a. All of these four finals all consisted of Porto winning the competition.\nThe Est\u00e1dio Municipal de Aveiro is the home stadium of &lt;a href=\"S.C.%20Beira-Mar\"&gt;Beira-Mar&lt;/a&gt;. It holds a capacity for 30,127 spectators. The stadium was built in 2003 and replaced the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20M%C3%A1rio%20Duarte\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio M\u00e1rio Duarte&lt;/a&gt; which was Beira-Mar's home stadium from 1930 until 2003. The stadium was used for two games at &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt;.\nMatch.\nTeam selection.\nPorto went into the 2012 Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira with several players who were doubtful due to injury as well as players missing due to other commitments. In the weeks building up to the match, Porto had several players who were doubtful for the game but fully recuperated for the match. This was the case for &lt;a href=\"Eliaquim%20Mangala\"&gt;Eliaquim Mangala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marc%20Janko\"&gt;Marc Janko&lt;/a&gt;. Newly acquired forward &lt;a href=\"Jackson%20Mart%C3%ADnez\"&gt;Jackson Mart\u00ednez&lt;/a&gt; was included in the squad after receiving international clearance for him to join Porto from Mexican team &lt;a href=\"Chiapas%20F.C.\"&gt;Chiapas&lt;/a&gt;. Porto's &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Sandro\"&gt;Alex Sandro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Danilo%20%28footballer%2C%20born%20July%201991%29\"&gt;Danilo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hulk%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Hulk&lt;/a&gt; missed the Superta\u00e7a due to being a part of the &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20under-23%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazilian national under-23 team&lt;/a&gt; who were participating in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2012 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"V%C3%ADtor%20Pereira%20%28football%20manager%29\"&gt;V\u00edtor Pereira&lt;/a&gt;'s squad selection for the match saw him leave out Argentine midfielder &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Iturbe\"&gt;Juan Iturbe&lt;/a&gt; and centre forward Marc Janko despite being recovered from an injury. Pereira's selection also saw him leave out &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lvaro%20Pereira\"&gt;\u00c1lvaro Pereira&lt;/a&gt;, who was on the verge of signing for &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt;. Pereira's squad selection for the Superta\u00e7a saw him include two newly acquired players; &lt;a href=\"Fabiano%20Ribeiro%20de%20Freitas\"&gt;Fabiano&lt;/a&gt; and Jackson Mart\u00ednez. Porto's starting line-up would see &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Lopes\"&gt;Miguel Lopes&lt;/a&gt; and Eliaquim Mangala start the game in the full back positions after first-team regulars Alex Sandro and Danilo were unavailable for the game. The surprise choices in the starting line up saw &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Defour\"&gt;Steven Defour&lt;/a&gt; start over &lt;a href=\"Jo%C3%A3o%20Moutinho\"&gt;Jo\u00e3o Moutinho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Atsu\"&gt;Christian Atsu&lt;/a&gt; start over &lt;a href=\"Silvestre%20Varela\"&gt;Silvestre Varela&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcad\u00e9mica went into the 2012 Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira with no injuries to any of its players. &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Emanuel\"&gt;Pedro Emanuel&lt;/a&gt; selected a squad of 19 players for the Superta\u00e7a. His squad selection for the Superta\u00e7a saw him include ten newly acquired players: Afonso, &lt;a href=\"Bruno%20China\"&gt;Bruno China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleyton%20Rafael%20Lima%20da%20Silva\"&gt;Cleyton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edinho%20%28footballer%2C%20born%20July%201982%29\"&gt;Edinho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nuno%20Henrique%20Gon%C3%A7alves%20Nogueira\"&gt;Henrique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Ogu\"&gt;John Ogu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Judikael%20Magique%20Goualy\"&gt;Magique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leandro%20dos%20Santos%20de%20Jesus\"&gt;Makelele&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rodrigo%20Galo%20Brito\"&gt;Rodrigo Galo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salim%20Ciss%C3%A9\"&gt;Salim Ciss\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. Of those ten, Afonso, Cleyton, Makelele, Galo and Ciss\u00e9 would start the game. Ogu and Magique were later used in the game as substitutes. The surprise choice in Pedro Emanuel's starting eleven saw first-team goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Romuald%20Peiser\"&gt;Romuald Peiser&lt;/a&gt; be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Jorge%20Novo%20Nunes\"&gt;Ricardo&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nPorto dominated possession early on and created several chances which tested Acad\u00e9mica's defense. The first major chance of the game saw &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Lopes\"&gt;Miguel Lopes&lt;/a&gt; receive the ball inside the eighteen yard box and pass it to &lt;a href=\"James%20Rodr%C3%ADguez\"&gt;James Rodr\u00edguez&lt;/a&gt; who fired the ball into Ricardo's hands. Porto's dominance continued with &lt;a href=\"Maicon%20Pereira%20Roque\"&gt;Maicon&lt;/a&gt;'s free kick being parried by Ricardo and on the follow up, Ricardo blocked Christian Atsu's shot. The first half would remain goalless. Porto entered into the second half dominating possession just like they did in the first half. The first major goal scoring chance of the second half saw &lt;a href=\"Lucho%20Gonz%C3%A1lez\"&gt;Lucho Gonz\u00e1lez&lt;/a&gt; play the ball into Acad\u00e9mica's penalty box where Jackson Mart\u00ednez couldn't capitalize off Acad\u00e9mica's defense frailties when he shot the ball over the bar. As the score remained goalless, V\u00edtor Pereira brought on &lt;a href=\"Djalma%20Campos\"&gt;Djalma&lt;/a&gt; and Jo\u00e3o Moutinho. Pereira's substitutions were paying off, as Porto started to create more chances and provide more attacking threat. Porto's next major threat on goal saw &lt;a href=\"Nicol%C3%A1s%20Otamendi\"&gt;Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi&lt;/a&gt;'s bicycle kick be saved by Ricardo from a resulting James Rodr\u00edguez corner kick. As the game drew closer to the end, it seemed that the Superta\u00e7a would be settled on overtime but in the ninetieth minute of the game, a right wing cross found Jackson Mart\u00ednez in the box who headed the ball past Ricardo to grant Porto a nineteenth Superta\u00e7a."
