    "text": "Edvard Hagerup Grieg ( , ; 15 June 18434 September 1907) was a Norwegian &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pianist\"&gt;pianist&lt;/a&gt;. He is widely considered one of the main &lt;a href=\"Romantic%20music\"&gt;Romantic era&lt;/a&gt; composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide. His use and development of &lt;a href=\"Music%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Norwegian folk music&lt;/a&gt; in his own compositions brought the music of Norway to international consciousness, as well as helping to develop a &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20romantic%20nationalism\"&gt;national identity&lt;/a&gt;, much as &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Sibelius\"&gt;Jean Sibelius&lt;/a&gt; did in &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bed%C5%99ich%20Smetana\"&gt;Bed\u0159ich Smetana&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemia&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrieg is the most celebrated person from the city of &lt;a href=\"Bergen\"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt;, with numerous statues which depict his image, and many cultural entities named after him: the city's largest concert building (&lt;a href=\"Grieg%20Hall\"&gt;Grieg Hall&lt;/a&gt;), its most advanced music school (&lt;a href=\"Grieg%20Academy\"&gt;Grieg Academy&lt;/a&gt;) and its professional choir (Edvard Grieg Kor). The Edvard Grieg Museum at Grieg's former home &lt;a href=\"Troldhaugen\"&gt;Troldhaugen&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to his legacy.\nBackground.\nEdvard Hagerup Grieg was born in &lt;a href=\"Bergen\"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt;, Norway (then part of &lt;a href=\"Sweden%E2%80%93Norway\"&gt;Sweden\u2013Norway&lt;/a&gt;). His parents were Alexander Grieg (1806\u20131875), a merchant and the British Vice-Consul in Bergen; and Gesine Judithe Hagerup (1814\u20131875), a music teacher and daughter of solicitor and politician &lt;a href=\"Edvard%20Hagerup\"&gt;Edvard Hagerup&lt;/a&gt;. The family name, originally spelled &lt;a href=\"Greig%20%28name%29\"&gt;Greig&lt;/a&gt;, is associated with the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20clans\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Gregor\"&gt;Clann Ghriogair (Clan Gregor)&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Culloden\"&gt;Battle of Culloden&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland in 1746, Grieg's great-grandfather, Alexander Greig (1739-1803), originally of &lt;a href=\"Aberdeenshire%20%28historic%29\"&gt;Aberdeenshire&lt;/a&gt;, travelled widely before settling in Norway about 1770 and establishing business interests in Bergen. Grieg's paternal great-great-grandparents, John (1702-1774) and Anne (1704-1784), are buried in the churchyard of the abandoned Church of St Ethernan in &lt;a href=\"Rathen%2C%20Aberdeenshire\"&gt;Rathen, Aberdeenshire&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland. Grieg's first cousin, twice removed, was Canadian pianist &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Gould\"&gt;Glenn Gould&lt;/a&gt;, whose mother was a Grieg. \nEdvard Grieg was raised in a musical family. His mother was his first piano teacher and taught him to play at the age of six. Grieg studied in several schools, including &lt;a href=\"Tanks%20Upper%20Secondary%20School\"&gt;Tanks Upper Secondary School&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the summer of 1858, Grieg met the eminent Norwegian violinist &lt;a href=\"Ole%20Bull\"&gt;Ole Bull&lt;/a&gt;, who was a family friend; Bull's brother was married to Grieg's aunt. Bull recognized the 15-year-old boy's talent and persuaded his parents to send him to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Music%20and%20Theatre%20Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig Conservatory&lt;/a&gt;, the piano department of which was directed by &lt;a href=\"Ignaz%20Moscheles\"&gt;Ignaz Moscheles&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrieg enrolled in the &lt;a href=\"music%20school\"&gt;conservatory&lt;/a&gt;, concentrating on piano, and enjoyed the many concerts and recitals given in &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;. He disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study. An exception was the &lt;a href=\"organ%20%28music%29\"&gt;organ&lt;/a&gt;, which was mandatory for piano students. About his study in the conservatory, he wrote to his biographer, &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Aimar%20Mow%20Gr%C3%B8nvold\"&gt;Aimar Gr\u00f8nvold&lt;/a&gt;, in 1881: \"I must admit, unlike &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Svendsen\"&gt;Svendsen&lt;/a&gt;, that I left Leipzig Conservatory just as stupid as I entered it. Naturally, I did learn something there, but my individuality was still a closed book to me.\"\nDuring the spring of 1860, he survived two life-threatening &lt;a href=\"Respiratory%20disease\"&gt;lung diseases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pleurisy\"&gt;pleurisy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tuberculosis\"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout his life, Grieg's health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine. He suffered from numerous respiratory infections, and ultimately developed combined lung and heart failure. Grieg was admitted many times to spas and &lt;a href=\"Sanatorium\"&gt;sanatoria&lt;/a&gt; both in Norway and abroad. Several of his doctors became his friends.\nCareer.\nDuring 1861, Grieg made his debut as a concert pianist in &lt;a href=\"Karlshamn\"&gt;Karlshamn&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden. In 1862, he finished his studies in Leipzig and had his first concert in his home town, where his programme included &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven\"&gt;Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Piano%20Sonata%20No.%208%20%28Beethoven%29\"&gt;Path\u00e9tique&lt;/a&gt;\" sonata.\nIn 1863, Grieg went to &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, Denmark, and stayed there for three years. He met the Danish composers &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Peter%20Emilius%20Hartmann\"&gt;J. P. E. Hartmann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Niels%20Gade\"&gt;Niels Gade&lt;/a&gt;. He also met his fellow Norwegian composer &lt;a href=\"Rikard%20Nordraak\"&gt;Rikard Nordraak&lt;/a&gt; (composer of the &lt;a href=\"Ja%2C%20vi%20elsker%20dette%20landet\"&gt;Norwegian national anthem&lt;/a&gt;), who became a good friend and source of inspiration. Nordraak died in 1866, and Grieg composed a &lt;a href=\"Funeral%20March%20in%20Memory%20of%20Rikard%20Nordraak\"&gt;funeral march&lt;/a&gt; in his honor.\nOn 11 June 1867, Grieg married his first cousin, &lt;a href=\"Nina%20Grieg\"&gt;Nina Hagerup&lt;/a&gt; (1845\u20131935), a lyric soprano. The next year, their only child, Alexandra, was born. Alexandra died in 1869 from &lt;a href=\"meningitis\"&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;. During the summer of 1868, Grieg wrote his &lt;a href=\"Piano%20Concerto%20%28Grieg%29\"&gt;Piano Concerto in A minor&lt;/a&gt; while on holiday in Denmark. &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Neupert\"&gt;Edmund Neupert&lt;/a&gt; gave the concerto its premiere performance on 3 April 1869 in the Casino Theatre in Copenhagen. Grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Christiania&lt;/a&gt; (now Oslo).\nDuring 1868, &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Liszt\"&gt;Franz Liszt&lt;/a&gt;, who had not yet met Grieg, wrote a testimonial for him to the Norwegian Ministry of Education, which resulted in Grieg's obtaining a travel grant. The two men met in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; in 1870. During Grieg's first visit, they examined Grieg's Violin Sonata No. 1, which pleased Liszt greatly. On his second visit in April, Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto, which Liszt proceeded to sightread (including the orchestral arrangement). Liszt's rendition greatly impressed his audience, although Grieg said gently to him that he played the first movement too quickly. Liszt also gave Grieg some advice on &lt;a href=\"orchestration\"&gt;orchestration&lt;/a&gt; (for example, to give the melody of the second theme in the first movement to a solo trumpet, which Grieg himself chose not to accept).\nIn the 1870's he became friends with the poet &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B8rnstjerne%20Bj%C3%B8rnson\"&gt;Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson&lt;/a&gt; who shared his interests in Norwegian self-government. Grieg set several of his poems to music, including \"Landkjenning\" and \"Sigurd Jorsalfar\". Eventually they decided on an opera based on King Olav Trygvason, but a dispute as to whether music or lyrics should be created first, led to Grieg being diverted to working on incidental music for &lt;a href=\"Henrik%20Ibsen\"&gt;Henrik Ibsen&lt;/a&gt;'s play \"&lt;a href=\"Peer%20Gynt\"&gt;Peer Gynt&lt;/a&gt;\", which naturally offended Bj\u00f8rnson. Eventually their friendship was resumed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"incidental%20music\"&gt;incidental music&lt;/a&gt; composed for \"Peer Gynt\" at the request of the author, contributed to its success, and has separately become some of the composer's most familiar music arranged as orchestral Suites.\nGrieg had close ties with the &lt;a href=\"Bergen%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra\"&gt;Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; (Harmonien), and later became Music Director of the orchestra from 1880 to 1882. In 1888, Grieg met &lt;a href=\"Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky\"&gt;Tchaikovsky&lt;/a&gt; in Leipzig. Grieg was impressed by Tchaikovsky. Tchaikovsky thought very highly of Grieg's music, praising its beauty, originality and warmth.\nOn 6 December 1897, Grieg and his wife performed some of his music at a &lt;a href=\"House%20concert\"&gt;private concert&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Castle\"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and her court.\nGrieg was awarded two honorary doctorates, first by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; in 1894 and the next from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt; in 1906.\nLater years.\nThe Norwegian government provided Grieg with a pension as he reached retirement age. During the spring of 1903, Grieg made nine 78-rpm &lt;a href=\"gramophone%20record\"&gt;gramophone record&lt;/a&gt;ings of his piano music in Paris. All of these discs have been reissued on both LPs and CDs, despite limited fidelity. Grieg recorded &lt;a href=\"player%20piano\"&gt;player piano&lt;/a&gt; music rolls for the Hupfeld Phonola piano-player system and &lt;a href=\"Welte-Mignon\"&gt;Welte-Mignon&lt;/a&gt; reproducing system, all of which survive and can be heard today. He also worked with the &lt;a href=\"Aeolian%20Company\"&gt;Aeolian Company&lt;/a&gt; for its 'Autograph Metrostyle' piano roll series wherein he indicated the tempo mapping for many of his pieces.\nIn 1899, Grieg cancelled his concerts in France in protest of the &lt;a href=\"Dreyfus%20Affair\"&gt;Dreyfus Affair&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-semitic scandal that was then roiling French politics. Regarding this scandal, Grieg had written that he hoped that the French might, \"Soon return to the spirit of 1789, when the French republic declared that it would defend basic human rights.\" As a result of his statements concerning the affair, he became the target of much French &lt;a href=\"hate%20mail\"&gt;hate mail&lt;/a&gt; of that day.\nDuring 1906, he met the composer and pianist &lt;a href=\"Percy%20Grainger\"&gt;Percy Grainger&lt;/a&gt; in London. Grainger was a great admirer of Grieg's music and a strong empathy was quickly established. In a 1907 interview, Grieg stated: \"I have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play, and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played! He is a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love.\"\nEdvard Grieg died at the Municipal Hospital in Bergen, Norway, on 4 September 1907 at age 64 from &lt;a href=\"heart%20failure\"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;. He had suffered a long period of illness. His last words were \"Well, if it must be so.\"\nThe funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people to the streets of his home town to honor him. Obeying his wish, his own \"&lt;a href=\"Funeral%20March%20in%20Memory%20of%20Rikard%20Nordraak\"&gt;Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak&lt;/a&gt;\" was played with orchestration by his friend &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Halvorsen\"&gt;Johan Halvorsen&lt;/a&gt;, who had married Grieg's niece. In addition, the \"Funeral March\" movement from &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin\"&gt;Chopin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Piano%20Sonata%20No.%202%20%28Chopin%29\"&gt;Piano Sonata No. 2&lt;/a&gt; was played. Grieg was &lt;a href=\"cremated\"&gt;cremated&lt;/a&gt; in the first Norwegian &lt;a href=\"crematorium\"&gt;crematorium&lt;/a&gt; opened in Bergen just that year, and his ashes were entombed in a mountain crypt near his house, Troldhaugen. After the death of his wife, her ashes were placed alongside his.\nEdvard Grieg and his wife were &lt;a href=\"Unitarianism\"&gt;Unitarians&lt;/a&gt; and Nina attended the Unitarian church in Copenhagen after his death.\nA century after his death, Grieg's legacy extends beyond the field of music. There is a &lt;a href=\"Bust%20of%20Edvard%20Grieg\"&gt;large sculpture&lt;/a&gt; of Grieg in &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, while one of the largest hotels in Bergen (his hometown) is named Quality Hotel Edvard Grieg (with over 370 rooms), and a large crater on the planet &lt;a href=\"Mercury%20%28planet%29\"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt; is named after Grieg.\nMusic.\nSome of Grieg's early works include a &lt;a href=\"symphony\"&gt;symphony&lt;/a&gt; (which he later suppressed) and a &lt;a href=\"Piano%20Sonata%20%28Grieg%29\"&gt;piano sonata&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote three &lt;a href=\"Violin%20Sonatas%20%28Grieg%29\"&gt;violin sonatas&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Cello%20Sonata%20%28Grieg%29\"&gt;cello sonata&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrieg composed the &lt;a href=\"incidental%20music\"&gt;incidental music&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Henrik%20Ibsen\"&gt;Henrik Ibsen&lt;/a&gt;'s play \"&lt;a href=\"Peer%20Gynt\"&gt;Peer Gynt&lt;/a&gt;\", which includes the excerpts \"&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Hall%20of%20the%20Mountain%20King\"&gt;In the Hall of the Mountain King&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Morning%20Mood\"&gt;Morning Mood&lt;/a&gt;\". In an 1874 letter to his friend &lt;a href=\"Frants%20Beyer\"&gt;Frants Beyer&lt;/a&gt;, Grieg expressed his unhappiness with \"Dance of the Mountain King's Daughter\", one of the movements in the \"&lt;a href=\"Peer%20Gynt%20%28Grieg%29\"&gt;Peer Gynt&lt;/a&gt;\" incidental music, writing \"I have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain King \u2013 something that I literally can't bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies, exaggerated Norwegian nationalism, and trollish self-satisfaction! But I have a hunch that the irony will be discernible.\"\nGrieg's \"&lt;a href=\"Holberg%20Suite\"&gt;Holberg Suite&lt;/a&gt;\" was originally written for the piano, and later arranged by the composer for &lt;a href=\"string%20instrument\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; orchestra. Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Heine\"&gt;Heinrich Heine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe\"&gt;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&lt;/a&gt;, Henrik Ibsen, &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Christian%20Andersen\"&gt;Hans Christian Andersen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rudyard%20Kipling\"&gt;Rudyard Kipling&lt;/a&gt; and others. Russian composer &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Myaskovsky\"&gt;Nikolai Myaskovsky&lt;/a&gt; used a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his Third String Quartet. Norwegian pianist &lt;a href=\"Eva%20Knardahl\"&gt;Eva Knardahl&lt;/a&gt; recorded the composer's complete piano music on 13 LPs for &lt;a href=\"BIS%20Records\"&gt;BIS Records&lt;/a&gt; from 1977 to 1980. The recordings were reissued during 2006 on 12 compact discs, also on &lt;a href=\"BIS%20Records\"&gt;BIS Records&lt;/a&gt;. Grieg himself recorded many of these piano works before his death in 1907. Pianist &lt;a href=\"Bertha%20Tapper\"&gt;Bertha Tapper&lt;/a&gt; edited Grieg\u2019s piano works for publication in America by Oliver Ditson.\nReferences.\nNotes\nBibliography"
