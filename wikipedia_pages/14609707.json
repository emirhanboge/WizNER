    "text": "The 1962 Rose Bowl, played on January 1, 1962, was the 48th &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Bowl%20Game\"&gt;Rose Bowl Game&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"1961%20Minnesota%20Golden%20Gophers%20football%20team\"&gt;Minnesota Golden Gophers&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href=\"1961%20UCLA%20Bruins%20football%20team\"&gt;UCLA Bruins&lt;/a&gt;, 21\u20133.\n&lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference\"&gt;Big Ten Conference&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href=\"1961%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football%20team\"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt; declined the invitation to play in the Rose Bowl. Days after the conclusion of the regular season, the university's faculty council voted 28\u201325 against participation in the Rose Bowl. They were under no contractual obligation to accept the invitation following the demise of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Pacific Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"1958%20NCAA%20University%20Division%20football%20season\"&gt;1958&lt;/a&gt; season. Minnesota, the runner-up in the Big Ten, was then offered the \"at-large\" invitation, and accepted.\nMinnesota quarterback &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Stephens\"&gt;Sandy Stephens&lt;/a&gt; was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game. It was broadcast on the &lt;a href=\"NBC%20Sports\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; television network and was the first national &lt;a href=\"color%20television\"&gt;color television&lt;/a&gt; broadcast of a college football game.\nTeams.\nUniversity of Minnesota Golden Gophers.\nThe Gophers had gone to the &lt;a href=\"1961%20Rose%20Bowl\"&gt;Rose Bowl the previous year&lt;/a&gt; as the #1 team in the nation and lost to the &lt;a href=\"1960%20Washington%20Huskies%20football%20team\"&gt;Washington Huskies&lt;/a&gt;. In 1961, the Gophers actually finished in second place in Big Ten Conference play. Minnesota had a loss to &lt;a href=\"1961%20Missouri%20Tigers%20football%20team\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, and a Big Ten loss to &lt;a href=\"1961%20Wisconsin%20Badgers%20football%20team\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Bunyan%27s%20Axe\"&gt;their rivalry game&lt;/a&gt;. Ohio State was the Big Ten champion, but because of a faculty council decision to emphasize academics over athletics, the Buckeyes turned down the Rose Bowl berth. Ironically, Minnesota would not have received the Rose Bowl invitation if they had, in fact, been the 1961 Big Ten champion and the conference had a formal agreement with the Rose Bowl for the 1961 and 1962 games, since the Big Ten had a \"no-repeat\" rule in effect until &lt;a href=\"1972%20Rose%20Bowl\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt;. The Gophers were led by &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Stephens\"&gt;Sandy Stephens&lt;/a&gt;, the first African American &lt;a href=\"1961%20College%20Football%20All-America%20Team\"&gt;All-American&lt;/a&gt; quarterback. However, he was not the first African-American starting quarterback in a Rose Bowl (this distinction goes to &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Fremont%20West\"&gt;Charles Fremont West&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%26amp%3B%20Jefferson%20Presidents%20football\"&gt;Washington &amp; Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, forty years earlier in &lt;a href=\"1922%20Rose%20Bowl\"&gt;1922&lt;/a&gt;).\nUCLA Bruins.\nIn the regular season, UCLA had lost at both &lt;a href=\"1961%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and Ohio State earlier in the season. They also lost to &lt;a href=\"1961%20Washington%20Huskies%20football%20team\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, but managed to beat &lt;a href=\"1961%20USC%20Trojans%20football%20team\"&gt;USC&lt;/a&gt; during one of the few rainy games in the &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Bell%20%28UCLA%E2%80%93USC%29\"&gt;rivalry&lt;/a&gt;.\nGame summary.\nThe weather was sunny, and Minnesota wore their home maroon jerseys, with white helmets and white pants, while UCLA also wore their home powder blue uniforms with gold pants. Using the &lt;a href=\"Single-wing%20formation\"&gt;single wing&lt;/a&gt; offense, UCLA struggled against the Gophers, netting only one field goal to open the scoring in the first quarter. Minnesota had 21 first downs to UCLA's 8, and the Gophers held the Bruins to 107 total yards, while gaining 297 yards on 66 plays. Stephens rushed for 46 yards on 12 carries, including two rushing touchdowns, and was 7 for 11 in passing for 75 yards.\nAftermath.\nThis is Minnesota's only Rose Bowl win and its most recent appearance. Through the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Minnesota%20Golden%20Gophers%20football%20team\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt; season, Minnesota has gone the longest in the Big Ten conference without playing in the Rose Bowl game. Sandy Stephens was named the Most Valuable player, and became the first African American to get the award.\nBoth head coaches in the game were &lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20Volunteers%20football\"&gt;University of Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; graduates who had played under legendary coach &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Neyland\"&gt;Robert Neyland&lt;/a&gt;.\nGame facts.\nAll-American defensive tackle &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Bell\"&gt;Bobby Bell&lt;/a&gt; played in both the 1961 and 1962 Rose Bowls for the Gophers. He later played in two &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;s with the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Chiefs\"&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20I\"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20IV\"&gt;IV&lt;/a&gt;, winning the latter in January &lt;a href=\"1969%20Kansas%20City%20Chiefs%20season\"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt;."
