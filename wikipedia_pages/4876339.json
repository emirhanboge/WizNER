    "text": "Anastasio Mart\u00edn Ignacio Vicente Tadeo Francisco Pellegrin Mart\u00edn y Soler (2 May 175430 January or 10 February 1806) was a Spanish composer of &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ballet\"&gt;ballet&lt;/a&gt;. Although relatively obscure now, in his own day he was compared favorably with his contemporary and admirer, &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart\"&gt;Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&lt;/a&gt;, as a composer of &lt;a href=\"opera%20buffa\"&gt;opera buffa&lt;/a&gt;. In his time he was called \"Martini lo spagnuolo\" (\"Martini the Spaniard\"); in modern times, he has been called \"the Valencian Mozart\". He was known primarily for his melodious Italian &lt;a href=\"comic%20opera\"&gt;comic opera&lt;/a&gt;s and his work with &lt;a href=\"Lorenzo%20Da%20Ponte\"&gt;Lorenzo Da Ponte&lt;/a&gt; in the late 18th century, as well as the melody from \"&lt;a href=\"Una%20cosa%20rara\"&gt;Una cosa rara&lt;/a&gt;\" quoted in the dining scene of Mozart's \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Giovanni\"&gt;Don Giovanni&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBiography.\nMart\u00edn y Soler was born in &lt;a href=\"Valencia\"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt;. His father, Francisco Xavier Mart\u00edn, was a tenor at the cathedral in town, where Vicente was a chorister there in his youth. Vicente moved to &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; probably around 1775, and studied music in &lt;a href=\"Bologna\"&gt;Bologna&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Battista%20Martini\"&gt;Giovanni Battista Martini&lt;/a&gt;. His first opera was \"Il tutore burlato\" (1775), to an Italian libretto adapted from &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Paisiello\"&gt;Giovanni Paisiello&lt;/a&gt;'s \"La frascatana\", which in turn was based on a play of the same title by Filippo Livigni. This was premiered in 1775 at the Teatro Real Coliseo in &lt;a href=\"San%20Lorenzo%20de%20El%20Escorial\"&gt;San Lorenzo de El Escorial&lt;/a&gt;, north of Madrid. In 1776 or 1777 the composer had the libretto translated into &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and put it into &lt;a href=\"zarzuela\"&gt;zarzuela&lt;/a&gt; form, adding spoken dialogue, as \"La madrile\u00f1a, o El tutor burlado\". This was performed in Madrid during 1778, by which time Mart\u00edn y Soler was back in Italy.\nAfter 1776, he wrote Italian operas, both comic and serious, which were performed throughout Italy. In 1777, he travelled to &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;, where he composed for the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20di%20San%20Carlo\"&gt;Teatro di San Carlo&lt;/a&gt;. During this period, he worked with choreographer &lt;a href=\"Charles%20le%20Picq\"&gt;Charles le Picq&lt;/a&gt; to compose four \"ballets d\u2019action\": \"La Griselda\" (1779, derived from the libretto by &lt;a href=\"Apostolo%20Zeno\"&gt;Apostolo Zeno&lt;/a&gt;), \"Il ratto della Sabine\" (1780), \"La bella Arsene\" (1781), and \"Tamas Kouli-Kan\" (1781, an interpretation of Vittorio Amedeo Cigna-Santi's libretto). He also worked with Zeno on an &lt;a href=\"opera%20seria\"&gt;opera seria&lt;/a&gt;, \"Andromaca\", in 1780. In addition, he composed two \"mezzocarattere\" ballets, \"La sposa persiana\" (1778) and \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" (1781, based on the play by &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Beaumarchais\"&gt;Pierre Beaumarchais&lt;/a&gt;). In Naples, he also worked with court librettist Luigi Serio on the composition of &lt;a href=\"opera%20seria\"&gt;opere serie&lt;/a&gt;, producing \"Ifigenia\" (1779) and \"Ipermestra\" (1780). Around 1780, he was also appointed court composer for &lt;a href=\"Charles%20IV%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Charles IV of Spain&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1785 he moved to &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, where he enjoyed great success with three operas composed to texts by &lt;a href=\"Lorenzo%20Da%20Ponte\"&gt;Lorenzo Da Ponte&lt;/a&gt;, who was simultaneously collaborating with Mozart and &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Salieri\"&gt;Antonio Salieri&lt;/a&gt;, the rival of the former. These three comedies were \"&lt;a href=\"Una%20cosa%20rara\"&gt;Una cosa rara&lt;/a&gt;\" (1786, based on the play \"La luna de la sierra\" by &lt;a href=\"Luis%20V%C3%A9lez%20de%20Guevara\"&gt;Luis V\u00e9lez de Guevara&lt;/a&gt;); \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20burbero%20di%20buon%20cuore\"&gt;Il burbero di buon cuore&lt;/a&gt;\" (1786, based on the play by &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Goldoni\"&gt;Carlo Goldoni&lt;/a&gt;); and \"&lt;a href=\"L%27arbore%20di%20Diana\"&gt;L'arbore di Diana&lt;/a&gt;\" (1787). He is credited with introducing, in \"Una cosa rara\", the &lt;a href=\"waltz\"&gt;waltz&lt;/a&gt; to Vienna; and a melody from the same work is &lt;a href=\"Musical%20quotation\"&gt;quoted by Mozart&lt;/a&gt; in the banquet scene in Act 2 of \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Giovanni\"&gt;Don Giovanni&lt;/a&gt;\" (1787). Soon, Mart\u00edn y Soler was also composing highly successful operas for &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Joseph II&lt;/a&gt;'s imperial theater.\nIn 1788, Mart\u00edn y Soler was invited to serve as composer and singing instructor at &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Catherine&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russia\"&gt;Russian court&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, where he wrote three &lt;a href=\"Russian%20language\"&gt;Russian language&lt;/a&gt; operas, \"The Unfortunate Hero Kosmetovich\" (1789, libretto written in part by &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20II%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Catherine the Great&lt;/a&gt;), \"Melomania\" (1790), and \"Fedul and his Children\" (1791, with &lt;a href=\"Vasili%20Pashkevich\"&gt;Vasili Pashkevich&lt;/a&gt;). Moving to London for the 1795 season, he provided three more &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian language&lt;/a&gt; operas: \"La capricciosa corretta\" (libretto again by Lorenzo Da Ponte, partly adapted from &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew\"&gt;The Taming of the Shrew&lt;/a&gt;\"); \"L'isola del piacere\" and \"Le nozze de' contadini spagnuoli\". \nHe returned to St. Petersburg and was appointed maestro di capella at the &lt;a href=\"Smolny%20Institute\"&gt;Smolny Institute&lt;/a&gt; (then called the Educational Society of Noble Maidens) in 1796. After returning to St Petersburg, he wrote his last opera, \"La festa del villaggio\" (1798).\nHe also wrote a number of tragic ballets during his residence as Court Composer there, including \"Didon abandon\u00e9e\" (1792), \"Amour et Psych\u00e9\" (1793, based on \"&lt;a href=\"Psych%C3%A9%20%28play%29\"&gt;Psych\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Moli%C3%A8re\"&gt;Moli\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Corneille\"&gt;Corneille&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20Quinault\"&gt;Philippe Quinault&lt;/a&gt;), \"Tancr\u00e8de\" (1799) and \"Le retour de Poliorc\u00e8te\" (1799). Shortly before his 1806 death in Saint Petersburg, he served as inspector for the Italian opera there. He was still in his post when he died."
