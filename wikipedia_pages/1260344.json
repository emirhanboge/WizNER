    "text": "Lalitpur Metropolitan City (), historically Patan ( \"P\u0101tan\", &lt;a href=\"Newar%20language\"&gt;Newar language&lt;/a&gt;: \"&lt;a href=\"Yalambar\"&gt;Yela&lt;/a&gt;\", ), is the third largest &lt;a href=\"cities%20of%20Nepal\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Kathmandu\"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pokhara\"&gt;Pokhara&lt;/a&gt;, and it is located in the south-central part of &lt;a href=\"Kathmandu%20Valley\"&gt;Kathmandu Valley&lt;/a&gt;, a new metropolitan city of Nepal. Lalitpur is also known as Manigal. It is best known for its rich &lt;a href=\"cultural%20heritage\"&gt;cultural heritage&lt;/a&gt;, particularly its tradition of arts and crafts. It is city renowned for its festival and feast, fine ancient art, and the making of metallic and stone carved statues. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Nepal%20census\"&gt;2011 Nepal census&lt;/a&gt; it had a population of 226,728 in 54,748 individual households. The city received extensive damage from &lt;a href=\"April%202015%20Nepal%20earthquake\"&gt;an earthquake on 25 April 2015&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nLalitpur is on the elevated tract of land in &lt;a href=\"Kathmandu%20Valley\"&gt;Kathmandu Valley&lt;/a&gt; on the south side of the &lt;a href=\"Bagmati%20River\"&gt;Bagmati River&lt;/a&gt;, which separates it from the city of Kathmandu on the northern and western side. The Karmanasa Khola acts as the boundary on the eastern side. It was developed on relatively thin layers of deposited clay and gravel in the central part of a dried ancient lake known as the &lt;a href=\"Nagdaha\"&gt;Nagdaha&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city has an area of 15.43 square kilometres and is divided into 29 &lt;a href=\"municipal\"&gt;municipal&lt;/a&gt; wards. It is bounded by:\nClimate.\nClimate is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. The &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20Climate%20Classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification&lt;/a&gt; subtype for this climate is \"&lt;a href=\"Humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;Cfa&lt;/a&gt;\" (Humid Subtropical Climate).\nHistory.\nLalitpur is believed to have been founded in the third century BC by the &lt;a href=\"Kirant\"&gt;Kirat dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and later expanded by &lt;a href=\"Licchavi%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Licchavi&lt;/a&gt;s in the sixth century. It was further expanded by the &lt;a href=\"Malla%20%28Nepal%29\"&gt;Malla&lt;/a&gt;s during the medieval period.\nThere are many legends about its name. The most popular one is the legend of the god &lt;a href=\"Rato%20Machindranath%20Jatra\"&gt;Rato Machhindranath&lt;/a&gt;, who was brought to the valley from Kamaru Kamachhya, located in &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, by a group of three people representing the three kingdoms centered in the &lt;a href=\"Kathmandu%20Valley\"&gt;Kathmandu Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of them was called Lalit, a farmer who carried god Rato Machhindranath to the valley all the way from &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. The purpose of bringing the god Rato Machhindranath to the valley was to overcome the worst drought there. There was a strong belief that the god Rato Machhindranath would bring rain in the valley. It was due to Lalit's effort that the god Rato Machhindranath was settled in Lalitpur. Many believe that the name of the town is kept after his name \"Lalit\" and \"pur\" meaning township.\nIn May, a chariot festival honoring the deity known as &lt;a href=\"Bunga%20Dyah%20Jatra%20%28chariot%20festival%29\"&gt;Bunga Dyah Jatra&lt;/a&gt; is held in Patan. It is the longest and one of the most important religious celebrations in Patan. During the month-long festival, an image of Rato Machhendanath is placed on a tall chariot and pulled through the city streets in stages.\nLalitpur said to have been founded by King Veer Deva in 299 AD, but there is unanimity among scholars that Patan was a well established and developed town since ancient times. Several historical records including many other legends indicate that Patan is the oldest of all the cities of Kathmandu Valley. According to a very old &lt;a href=\"Kirant\"&gt;Kirat&lt;/a&gt; chronicle, Patan was founded by Kirat rulers long before the Licchavi rulers came into the political scene in &lt;a href=\"Kathmandu%20Valley\"&gt;Kathmandu Valley&lt;/a&gt;. According to that chronicle, the earliest known capital of Kirat rulers was Thankot. &lt;a href=\"Kathmandu\"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt;, the present capital was most possibly removed from Thankot to Patan after the Kirati King &lt;a href=\"Yalamber\"&gt;Yalamber&lt;/a&gt; came into power sometimes around second century AD.\nOne of the most used and typical &lt;a href=\"Newar\"&gt;Newar&lt;/a&gt; names of Lalitpur is Yela. It is said that King &lt;a href=\"Yalamber\"&gt;Yalamber&lt;/a&gt; or Yellung Hang named this city after himself, and ever since this ancient city was known as Yala.\nIn 1768, Lalitpur was annexed to the &lt;a href=\"Gorkha%20Kingdom\"&gt;Gorkha Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Prithvi%20Narayan%20Shah\"&gt;Prithvi Narayan Shah&lt;/a&gt; without any battle.\nHistorical monuments.\nThe city was initially designed in the shape of the &lt;a href=\"Buddhist\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; Dharma-Chakra (Wheel of Righteousness). The four \"thurs\" or mounds on the perimeter of Patan are ascribed around, one at each corner of its cardinal points, which are popularly known as Asoka Stupas. Legend has it that Emperor &lt;a href=\"Asoka\"&gt;Asoka&lt;/a&gt; (the legendary King of &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;) visited with his daughter Charumati to &lt;a href=\"Kathmandu\"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt; in 250 BC and erected five Asoka Stupas, four in the surrounding and one at the middle of the Patan. The size and shape of these stupas seem to breathe their antiquity in a real sense. There are more than 1,200 &lt;a href=\"Buddhist\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; monuments of various shapes and sizes scattered in and around the city.\nThe most important monument of the city is &lt;a href=\"Patan%20Durbar%20Square\"&gt;Patan Durbar Square&lt;/a&gt;, which has been listed by &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; as one of seven Monument Zones that make up the &lt;a href=\"Kathmandu%20Valley\"&gt;Kathmandu Valley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;. The seven monument zones were included in the &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20List\"&gt;World Heritage List&lt;/a&gt; in 1979 as one integrated site. The monument zones are declared as protected and preserved according to the Monuments Preservation Act of 1956. The Square was heavily damaged on &lt;a href=\"April%202015%20Nepal%20earthquake\"&gt;25 April 2015 by an earthquake&lt;/a&gt;.\nLalitpur was planned in Vihars and Bahils. Out of 295 Vihars and Bahils of the valley 56% of them are in Patan. The water conduits, &lt;a href=\"dhunge%20dhara\"&gt;stone spouts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tutedhara\"&gt;jaladroni&lt;/a&gt; (water tanks), artistic gate ways, Hindu temples and Buddhist Vihars adorn the city.\nEconomy.\nA substantial portion of the &lt;a href=\"population\"&gt;population&lt;/a&gt; is engaged in trades, notably in &lt;a href=\"Nepalese%20handicrafts\"&gt;traditional handicrafts&lt;/a&gt; and small-scale &lt;a href=\"cottage%20industries\"&gt;cottage industries&lt;/a&gt;, and some residents work in &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt;. Lalitpur has produced the highest number of renowned artists and finest craftsmen ever recorded in the history of Nepali art.\nLalitpur has maintained a culture of craftwork even in the face of rapid urbanization and many social and political upheavals.\nThe city is less urbanized than Kathmandu, north of the Bagmati river, but is home to many workshops, stores, restaurants, hotels, schools, embassies and other important sectors of the Kathmandu Valley economy.\n&lt;a href=\"Buddha%20Air\"&gt;Buddha Air&lt;/a&gt; has its headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Jawalakhel\"&gt;Jawalakhel&lt;/a&gt;, near Patan.\nEducation.\nPostsecondary education.\nLalitpur is home to &lt;a href=\"Pulchok%20campus\"&gt;Pulchowk Engineering Campus&lt;/a&gt;, one of the oldest and most reputed colleges affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20Engineering\"&gt;Institute of Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tribhuvan%20University\"&gt;Tribhuvan University&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Patan%20Academy%20of%20Health%20Sciences\"&gt;Patan Academy of Health Sciences&lt;/a&gt; is the only medical university in the city with Patan Hospital as its primary teaching hospital, and there is another medical school - KIST Medical College in Lalitpur. Other institutions of higher learning in Patan include Kathmandu University School of Management (KU SOM) and &lt;a href=\"Patan%20Multiple%20Campus\"&gt;Patan Multiple Campus&lt;/a&gt;. Pinnacle College, one of the oldest private college of Lalitpur.\nPrimary and secondary education.\nThe city is served by a number of private and public institutions providing education from primary until secondary level.

It is at Harihar Bhawan. &lt;a href=\"Madan%20Puraskar%20Pustakalaya\"&gt;Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya&lt;/a&gt; which awards the \"Madan Puraskar\" and \"Jagadamba Shree Puraskar\" literary prizes is in the city. There are also numbers of library around Lalitpur Metropolitan city such as Deepawali Pustakalaya in Satdobato, Buddhibikash Library in Lagankhel.\nLandmarks.\nLalitpur is renowned as a very artistic city. Most of the Nepalese art is devoted to gods, and there are an abundance of &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vihara\"&gt;vihara&lt;/a&gt;s. Notable landmarks include:\nTransportation.\nAirports.\nAll international and domestic flights for &lt;a href=\"Kathmandu%20Valley\"&gt;Kathmandu Valley&lt;/a&gt; are handled by &lt;a href=\"Tribhuvan%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Tribhuvan International Airport&lt;/a&gt; which lies about 7\u00a0km from Patan City Centre.\nRoads.\nWalking is the easiest method of transportation within the city as the core is densely populated. In terms of motor transport, &lt;a href=\"Ring%20Road%20%28Kathmandu%29\"&gt;Kathmandu Ring Road&lt;/a&gt; which encircles the central part of the valley is a strategic road in the city. Connection to &lt;a href=\"Kathmandu\"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href=\"Bagmati%20River\"&gt;Bagmati River&lt;/a&gt; is provided by a host of road and pedestrian bridges. The most trafficked and important bridge connecting to the centre of Kathmandu is Thapathali Bridge. Since pedestrians and vehicles often have to share the same road, traffic congestion is a major problem in Patan. Efforts are being made to widen roads to make them more suitable to vehicular traffic.\nPublic transportation.\nPrivate companies operate a number of routes connecting Patan with other places in the valley. Buses, micro-buses and electric tempos are the most common forms of public transport seen in the city. Lalitpur Yatayat buses connects the touristic &lt;a href=\"Thamel\"&gt;Thamel&lt;/a&gt; area of Kathmandu with buses stopping at Patan Dhoka, a five-minute walk to Patan Durbar Square. Lagankhel Bus Park is the central transport hub.\nInfrastructure.\nHospitals.\n&lt;a href=\"Patan%20Hospital\"&gt;Patan Hospital&lt;/a&gt; is the teaching hospital for the &lt;a href=\"Patan%20Academy%20of%20Health%20Sciences\"&gt;Patan Academy of Health Sciences&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sumeru%20Hospital\"&gt;Sumeru Hospital&lt;/a&gt; as kidney hospital locate at &lt;a href=\"Dhapakhel\"&gt;Dhapakhel&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedia.\nTo Promote local culture Patan has one FM radio station Radio Sagarmatha - 102.4\u00a0MHz which is a &lt;a href=\"Community%20radio\"&gt;Community radio&lt;/a&gt; station.\nSport.\nNepal Squash Rackets Association (NSRA)(Satdobato,\nInternational Swimming Complex (Satdobato),\nAll Nepal Football Association (ANFA) (Satdobato),\nNepal Taekwondo Association (Satdobato,\nSatdobato Youth Club (Satdobato,\nKhumaltar Youth Club,\nTennis Complex (Satdobato),\nArmy Physical Training Centre (Lagankhel),\nNational Sports Centre (Chyasal)\nLanguage.\nThe original native language of Patan is &lt;a href=\"Nepal%20Bhasa\"&gt;Nepal Bhasa&lt;/a&gt; of Newars. Though due to the migration of other people from other places to Patan, other languages like &lt;a href=\"Nepali%20language\"&gt;Nepali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tamang%20language\"&gt;Tamang&lt;/a&gt;, etc. are also spoken."
