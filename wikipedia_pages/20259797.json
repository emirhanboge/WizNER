He is dark, seductive, elegant and somewhat clumsy at the same time cold, cruel and malevolent. Before the beginning of the series, he fell in love with Princess Cec\u00edlia but she doesn't recipocrate his feelings for her and in anger, he killed Cec\u00edlia's husband, Count Rog\u00e9rio but in her sorrow she commits suicide rather than marry a vampire. Her death still haunts him. Several centuries, later he marries several woman in order to create an heir to his legacy since he is already tired of his position. He has a baby son with another vampiress who dies in childbirth, who he hides from his jealous wife Mina d' Montmatre, switches him with another baby and he is raised as the son of L\u00edvia and Bobby.\nB\u00f3ris is an exceptionally powerful vampire, having been one of the oldest and he claims he cannot even remember how he started. He has &lt;a href=\"superhuman%20strength\"&gt;superhuman strength&lt;/a&gt;, can mesmerize anyone with his eyes, can teleport to great distances, has control over animals, can summon a fiery sword to fight his enemies, can erase people's memories, and has led armies over the centuries. B\u00f3ris can shapeshift into a cloud of bats, a giant wolf, and mist. B\u00f3ris can control weather and curse other vampires by erasing their fangs, but he is also capable of possessing anyone, however while in somebody else's body, his original body becomes helpless. In the beginning, he was unlikable and harsh, considered the antagonist, but his relationship with the humans and the other characters soften his personality and he becomes more compromising, understandable, and altruistic. He desires L\u00edvia more than anyone and wants to mutate her into his vampiress bride. B\u00f3ris bears a strong resemblance to &lt;a href=\"Barnabas%20Collins\"&gt;Barnabas Collins&lt;/a&gt; from the TV Series &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Shadows\"&gt;Dark Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nB\u00f3ris' teenage son and also a vampire.

When reaching the age of 13, he mutates into one of the undead as the heir of B\u00f3ris, however because of his loving personality, he doesn't become evil as his father expected, much to his chagrin and turns into a sort of \"good vampire\". When learning of each other, Jackie hates B\u00f3ris for making him what he is and is distrustful of him because he knows B\u00f3ris wants Zeca's adopted mother L\u00edvia, but as the series progressed, Zeca learns to love his father and admire his good personality traits, but still defies him.\nZeca never drinks blood or attacks humans but he has no problem when he uses his vampiric powers to impress anyone. He has &lt;a href=\"superhuman%20strength\"&gt;super strength&lt;/a&gt;, can shapeshift into a &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, can control his own &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt;, can teleport, has &lt;a href=\"telepathy\"&gt;telepathy&lt;/a&gt; and knows some few tricks but still his powers are not even a match to his father, but at one point he banished Martha Morta to &lt;a href=\"Hell\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; for a time before she returned a little bit pissed after a few seconds. He is even blessed by the angel Ezekiel, he can withstand sunlight without harm and enter churches or blessed houses. He is perhaps the only vampire who doesn't exhibit the evil behavior of other vampires in the series.

She becomes a widow when her husband dies, who also was the reincarnation of the princess's husband, ironically both of them died at the hands of B\u00f3ris Vladesco, directly or not. Her children are Zeca, Tet\u00ea and J\u00fanior, but it is revealed later in the series Zeca is a vampire and the real son of B\u00f3ris named Atilla Vladesco, and her real son, Renat, grew up in the orphanage until he became homeless in the streets but he was found by Zeca, who become his friend and later revealed to her, he was her true son.\nL\u00edvia has a complex relationship with B\u00f3ris Vladescu, because in the beginning, he under the alias of Igor Pivomar, saw himself as a stranger in her life. B\u00f3ris then took over Rodrigo's body to have a chance with L\u00edvia and they date for a time until B\u00f3ris could no longer stay much in his human body. When she comes to learn the vampire existence and B\u00f3ris being the head vampire \"and\" Igor Pivomar, she tries to stay away from him and come to hate and despise him for her husband's death.

For the first time, he was interrupted by the angel Ezekiel, the second by Augusto, and in the third, he was interrupted by Princess Cec\u00edlia's spirit herself, explaining to her she was saved by angels at the last second before hitting the ground. L\u00edvia comes to respect B\u00f3ris when he becomes more benevolent and before the final battle against the forces of dark, he bids \"Goodbye\" and tells her he would love her in death, as he loved her in life and undeath.

He disguises himself as one of the citizens of Maramures, and it is also revealed he was the vampire hunter trying to protect Princess Cec\u00edlia, now reincarnated as Ezequiel. He is kind and gentle, preferring to not fight the vampires and offering the chance of retreat before fighting. Ezequiel sees the people in black, white and shades of gray. He can teleport, &lt;a href=\"Pyrokinesis\"&gt;control fire&lt;/a&gt;, is a skilled swordsman and can heal other people and bless them. He forms a friendship with Zeca knowing he is not an enemy, despite being his rival's son and even helps him withstand sunlight and blessed objects. Ezequiel clashes several times with B\u00f3ris but he cannot defeat him. In the final chapter, he fights Nosferatu and kills him with the help of Zeca.

She tried to kill the baby, but B\u00f3ris staked her and hid the baby. Mina tried to kill Zeca several times, but he was much stronger than her.\nIn the middle of the series, Mina had a relationship with the human Rodrigo, and was impregnated by him telling everyone it was B\u00f3ris' child. When Mina gave birth to a baby girl, she disappeared for a long time, to return with her daughter Pandora, now a teenager. When Rodrigo is mortally wounded in the battle against Nosferatu's forces, she mutates him into a vampire and they both live together and forever.\nThe final antagonist appearing near the end is a master vampire much like B\u00f3ris. Despite his name, he is not associated with &lt;a href=\"Count%20Orlok\"&gt;Count Orlok&lt;/a&gt; from the movie of the same name but he bears a strong resemblance to Count Dracula in his aged form in the initial chapters. He wants to destroy B\u00f3ris so he can take over his title and then raise an army of vampires to turn Maramures into a Necropolis. He destroys Galileo, and convinces several vampires to join his cause, igniting the final battle between &lt;a href=\"good%20and%20evil\"&gt;good and evil&lt;/a&gt;. He orders the hotel the humans used as a stronghold to be burned and one by one the vampires loyal to him perish, until he confronts B\u00f3ris.

She abandoned their house and lived with B\u00f3ris Vladescu, who mutated her into his vampiress wife. She becomes more mean to everyone including B\u00f3ris, who regrets biting her. Eventually she is cursed several times by him, zipping her mouth shut and taking away her fangs. She betrays B\u00f3ris and becomes Nosferatu's lover, joining his cause of destroying B\u00f3ris Vladescu, but she is destroyed in a confrontation with L\u00edvia. Her name actually is Portuguese for \"Dead Martha\".\nRodrigo's seductive ex-girlfriend, she comes to Maramures to reassure he belongs to her. Heartbroken, she meets the vampire Victor, and asks him to bite her. He obeys and mutates her into a vampiress. She is sexually attractive and seductive, but at the same time she is treacherous and predatory. She always switches sides to her own benefit, even becoming Count Dracula's personal concubine. Due to Victor's destruction, she becomes once again human.\nA vampire, he is B\u00f3ris' right-hand man. Despite his position, Victor is not loyal to B\u00f3ris and tries to overthrow him in secret. He mutates Lara into a vampiress and they become lovers, but she leaves him to be Count Dracula's lover and he in turn stalked Ci\u00e7a, visiting her in her sleep, ravishing her and drinking her blood, which causes her to fade until she dies, rather than mutate into a vampiress. Victor sided with Nosferatu, in part as revenge against B\u00f3ris and in the final battle, he mortally wounds Godzilla and is destroyed by B\u00f3ris.\nSupporting humans.\nA clumsy, absent-minded and lousy vampire hunter. His ancestor tried to destroy B\u00f3ris and Mina d'Montmartre decades ago, but they frightened him to death. Galileo belongs to the Van Burguer family, a lineage of vampire slayers bent on destroying B\u00f3ris' house. His son Bart\u00f4 is skeptical about their legacy and doesn't believe in vampires. Unfortunately, B\u00f3ris' ex-wife Mina d'Montmartre and her servant Am\u00e9lie attack Bart\u00f4 and mutate him into a vampire but still, Galileo spares his son out of affection. Galileo is incompetent when it comes to vampire-hunting. His attempts annoy B\u00f3ris and Mina because he always misses the stake in their heart and he has a poor aim when he fires silver bullets at them. Despite his incompetence, he proves to be capable of destroying (unintentionally) Count Dracula by staking him in the heart, however he was trying to destroy Victor Victorio at the time, not Dracula.\nGalileo is destroyed by Nosferatu, who incinerates him. His remains are kept inside an urn and after his death, he comes back as a ghost haunting Nosferatu and appearing to Zoroastra in visions. In the end, he joins Zoroastra's spirit in Heaven.\nHis name is derived from &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20Galilei\"&gt;Galileo Galilei&lt;/a&gt;, and his family name is a joke on the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20characters%20in%20the%20Castlevania%20series\"&gt;Belmont family&lt;/a&gt; from the popular &lt;a href=\"video%20game\"&gt;video game&lt;/a&gt; series &lt;a href=\"Castlevania\"&gt;Castlevania&lt;/a&gt;, known for also fighting against evil.\nSupporting vampires.\nMina and Rodrigo's hybrid daughter, she is &lt;a href=\"dhampir\"&gt;dhampir&lt;/a&gt; for her father being human and her mother a vampiress, but she is described as always a vampiress.

Unlike the other vampires, Pandora is very girly and cheerful, and not necessarily evil and cruel.\nThe character Pandora was created when &lt;a href=\"Cl%C3%A1udia%20Raia\"&gt;Cl\u00e1udia Raia&lt;/a&gt;, the actress who played Mina, became &lt;a href=\"Pregnancy\"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the running series, and she had to take a license to have her baby, then the author Ant\u00f4nio Calmon had the idea of creating a relationship between Mina and Rodrigo which would result in Pandora.\nGalileo's only son, he is a hardcore &lt;a href=\"punk%20subculture\"&gt;punk-like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, who was mutated by Mina in order to regain her beauty. This event crushed his father Galileo, who is a vampire hunter, but he lets his son live out of mercy. Bart is quite extroverted and a joking person, but not an evil vampire, as a matter of fact, Bart is exceptionally cowardly and fearful, and rarely engage in battle unless if he came to protect his father or his lover Am\u00e9lie, but occasionally runs when he is alone or in danger. In the end of the series, he is reverted to a human due to B\u00f3ris' power sustaining his vampiric energy gone with his death. His fate is unknown as B\u00f3ris survived his destruction, and it is left unclear if he will remain human or return to being a vampire.\nMina's vampiress servant. She is quite sissy and devilish, speaking with an evil tone of voice. She is loyal to Mina and B\u00f3ris and had dated Bart Van Burger after his metamorphosis at the fangs of Mina.\nA robber who tried to assault B\u00f3ris when he came to Maramures, but he mutated Godzilla into a vampire upon calling B\u00f3ris a \"good-blood\" and B\u00f3ris replied before biting him, \"I like that, 'good blood'\".\nGodzilla becomes loyal to B\u00f3ris alone as his chauffeur, butler and personal security man. Normally, B\u00f3ris asked Godzilla how he must curse the other vampires, and Godzilla answered by committing very bizarre acts, such as taking away their fangs, blinding them like bats and petrifying them into talking stone statues. Godzilla never did something to anger B\u00f3ris, and always would obey his master. When B\u00f3ris is destroyed at the end of the series, Godzilla becomes human again, without the vampiric energy sustained by B\u00f3ris' power. His fate is unknown as he chose to live a more good life, but it is shown that B\u00f3ris survived his death, and it is unknown if he will mutate into a vampire again though it is likely that he will.\nA vampiress &lt;a href=\"physician\"&gt;doctor&lt;/a&gt; mutated by Mina several centuries ago, she becomes her close friend and helps her when she discovers Mina is impregnated by a human.
