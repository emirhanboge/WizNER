It is roughly bounded by the \"Ugrinova\u010dka\" and \"Banatska\" streets, while other important streets include \"Cara Du\u0161ana\" and \"Pregrevica\". Being elongated and one of the largest neighborhoods of Zemun, Gornji Grad is bordered by many other neighborhoods: &lt;a href=\"Gardo%C5%A1\"&gt;Gardo\u0161&lt;/a&gt; on the east, &lt;a href=\"%C4%86ukovac\"&gt;\u0106ukovac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muhar\"&gt;Muhar&lt;/a&gt; on the southeast, &lt;a href=\"Sava%20Kova%C4%8Devi%C4%87%20%28Zemun%29\"&gt;Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sutjeska%20%28Zemun%29\"&gt;Sutjeska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zemun%20Ba%C4%8Dka\"&gt;Zemun Ba\u010dka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ba%C4%8Dki%20Ilovik\"&gt;Ba\u010dki Ilovik&lt;/a&gt; on the south, &lt;a href=\"Altina%2C%20Belgrade\"&gt;Altina&lt;/a&gt; on the southwest, while in the west it extends in the direction of &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Galenika\"&gt;Nova Galenika&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gove%C4%91i%20Brod\"&gt;Gove\u0111i Brod&lt;/a&gt;. The section along the bank of the Danube is known as the sub-neighborhood of Pregrevica, after the main street in this part of Gornji Grad.\nCharacteristics.\nThe name of the neighborhood is descriptive, meaning the \"upper town\", above the Gardo\u0161 hill, as opposed to the neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Donji%20Grad%20%28Zemun%29\"&gt;Donji Grad&lt;/a&gt;, the \"lower town\", below the hill. According to the 2002 Census, it had a population of 15,819. It consisted of two local communities within the Zemun municipality, \"Branko Pe\u0161i\u0107\" and \"Janko Lisjak Pu\u0161ka\", but the municipality later abolished the local communities in the urban section of Zemun.\nFeatures.\nSome important facilities in the neighborhood include:\nGornja Varo\u0161 Elementary School.\nFounded on 31 October 1799, it is the oldest continuously operational school in modern Belgrade (Zemun wasn't part of Belgrade until 1934). There are schools which were older, but were either closed in the meantime, or didn't start as educational facilities. It is also located on the same place, but changed a dozen of states and also so many names.\nIt was founded after requests by the Serbian population, settled around the Church of the Holy Trinity. Modern Gornji Grad area was mostly inhabited by Germans, who already had their schools. Austrian authorities allowed &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Stratimirovi%C4%87\"&gt;Stefan Stratimirovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Metropolitanate%20of%20Karlovci\"&gt;Serbian metropolitan&lt;/a&gt;, to open the school next to the church. Original school building was on the present location. At the end of the 19th century the new building was constructed on the other side of the church. School operated in this object until 1968 when the new building was finished on the original location. It was built during the mayoral term of &lt;a href=\"Branko%20Pe%C5%A1i%C4%87\"&gt;Branko Pe\u0161i\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, born and raised in Zemun, who lived nearby. Previous building served as part of the school for a while, before it was adapted into the school for adults.\nThe only short period when school was closed was during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, when Hungarian military unit occupied the building. Some of the previous school names include the original name Gornjovaro\u0161ka Pu\u010dka \u0160kola, Kraljevi\u0107 Andrej and Vladimir Nazor. In the 2010s, both exterior and interior walls were painted by Miodrag Ivanovi\u0107. Depending on the location and classroom, murals depict &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Darwin\"&gt;Charles Darwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Columbus\"&gt;Christopher Columbus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stevan%20Mokranjac\"&gt;Stevan Mokranjac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven\"&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archimedes\"&gt;Archimedes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pythagoras\"&gt;Pythagoras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nikola%20Tesla\"&gt;Nikola Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, mayor Pe\u0161i\u0107.
