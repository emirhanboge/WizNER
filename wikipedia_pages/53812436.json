Despite his father and uncle being more fond of &lt;a href=\"Field%20hockey\"&gt;hockey&lt;/a&gt;, Gill found a passion for &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and would usually play with his friends at a nearby ground. In 2007, on the suggestion of a former Chandigarh Football Academy trainee, Ravinder, Gill attended trials for the famed academy and competed for a spot against around 100 other players. Gill's trial was successful and he joined the academy.\nGill trained at the Chandigarh Football Academy for five years from 2007 to 2012. Initially playing as a left-back, Gill was soon moved to become a &lt;a href=\"defender%20%28association%20football%29%23centre-back\"&gt;centre-back&lt;/a&gt;. In 2010, he won his first major championship with the academy, the under-14 competition of the &lt;a href=\"Subroto%20Cup\"&gt;Subroto Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012, Gill left the Chandigarh Football Academy in order to join the &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;All India Football Federation&lt;/a&gt;'s regional academy in &lt;a href=\"Navi%20Mumbai\"&gt;Navi Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;.

The camp lasted for three days and at the end, Gill, alongside India teammate &lt;a href=\"Bidyananda%20Singh\"&gt;Bidyananda Singh&lt;/a&gt;, was selected to participate in the All-Star Game. During the game and the camp overall, both Gill and Singh managed to catch the eye of European clubs such as &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt;.
