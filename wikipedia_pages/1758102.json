    "text": "Coraki is a small town that sits on the confluence of the &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20River\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wilson%20River%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Wilson River&lt;/a&gt;s in northern &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20Valley%20Council\"&gt;Richmond Valley&lt;/a&gt; Shire. At the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Australian%20census\"&gt;2016 census&lt;/a&gt;, Coraki had a population of 1,277 people.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Coraki\" is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Bundjalung%20language\"&gt;Bundjalung&lt;/a&gt; word \"gurigay\", meaning \"the meeting of the waters\", and the &lt;a href=\"Bundjalung%20people\"&gt;Bundjalung people&lt;/a&gt; are the &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Owners\"&gt;Traditional Owners&lt;/a&gt; of the area.\nThe village was founded by William Yabsley in 1849 when Lismore was only a small cattle station and Casino had only one store and a hotel. Yabsley and his family obtained the lease to Brook Station and established the first permanent settlement. He built his shipyard just above \"The Junction\", as it was first called. Many ships and river boats were launched there and Yabsley opened a store for provisions for the &lt;a href=\"Toona%20australis\"&gt;cedar&lt;/a&gt; cutters who came to the district. Transport at the time was almost entirely by water and Coraki was the busiest port on the Richmond River.\nDescription.\nCoraki is positioned centrally to the hub of the Summerland Way &lt;a href=\"Casino%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Casino&lt;/a&gt; ( west), the regional city of &lt;a href=\"Lismore%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Lismore&lt;/a&gt; ( north) and the popular tourist beachside location of &lt;a href=\"Evans%20Head%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Evans Head&lt;/a&gt; ( east). At the western boundary of Coraki township lies Box Ridge, an &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australian\"&gt;Aboriginal&lt;/a&gt; community.\nLike many other towns in the area, it is a hub for the local &lt;a href=\"agricultural\"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt; industries such as &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tea%20tree%20oil\"&gt;tea tree oil&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoraki is a small village with many community facilities: Coraki Fire Station, Coraki Public School, St Joseph's Primary School, St Joseph's Church, Coraki Uniting Church, Coraki Anglican Church, Coraki Community Hall, the Rural Transaction Centre, Mid-Richmond Museum, Coraki Library, post office, Mid-Richmond Retirement Village, cemetery, hockey fields, tennis courts, skate park, boat ramp, and the Memorial Park with barbecue, playground and picnic facilities aligning the \"healing stones\" riverside path. There is a number of local businesses, including the historic Coraki Hotel on Richmond Terrace.\nEvents.\nCoraki is the home of the annual Coraki Art Prize (formerly the Coraki Tea Tree Art Prize) and an art competition and exhibition open to all artists and including painting, drawing, photography, sculpture and printmaking, held late October.\nIn 2010, the first Dylanfest celebrated the music, art and poetry of &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Dylan\"&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt; in October at the Coraki Hotel.\nAnnually in November, the Tweed Water Skiing Club converges on the Richmond River to contest the \"Coraki Assault\" race.\nPopulation.\nAccording to the 2016 Census of Population, there were 1,277 people in Coraki, with the following demographic features:\nNative title.\nIn late April 2021, the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Court%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Federal Court of Australia&lt;/a&gt; convened at &lt;a href=\"Evans%20Head%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Evans Head&lt;/a&gt;, where a &lt;a href=\"native%20title%20in%20Australia\"&gt;native title&lt;/a&gt; determination was made over of land, consisting of 52 separate areas of land.
