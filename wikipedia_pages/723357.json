    "text": "Dalby S\u00f6derskog (literally \"Dalby South Forest\") is a small &lt;a href=\"national%20park\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt; in the province of &lt;a href=\"Scania\"&gt;Scania&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, situated in the &lt;a href=\"Lund%20Municipality\"&gt;municipality of Lund&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Dalby%2C%20Lund%20Municipality\"&gt;Dalby&lt;/a&gt;. It has an area of and consists of broadleaf forest. It was established in 1918, when it was thought to be a unique remnant of primeval forest. In fact, the area has previously been used for &lt;a href=\"pasture\"&gt;pasture&lt;/a&gt;. The ground contains much &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chalk\"&gt;chalk&lt;/a&gt;, which makes the flora rich. In particular, there are many spring flowers. An earth bank of unknown origin, possibly the ruins of an ancient fort, surrounds parts of the park. The national park encompasses the southern part of &lt;a href=\"Dalby%20hage\"&gt;Dalby hage&lt;/a&gt;, while the northern parts (&lt;a href=\"Dalby%20Norreskog\"&gt;Dalby Norreskog&lt;/a&gt; and H\u00e4sthagen) form a nature reserve."
