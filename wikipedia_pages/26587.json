    "text": "In music performances, rhythm guitar is a &lt;a href=\"guitar%20technique\"&gt;technique&lt;/a&gt; and role that performs a combination of two functions: to provide all or part of the rhythmic &lt;a href=\"pulse%20%28music%29\"&gt;pulse&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with other instruments from the &lt;a href=\"rhythm%20section\"&gt;rhythm section&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href=\"drumkit\"&gt;drum kit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bass%20guitar\"&gt;bass guitar&lt;/a&gt;); and to provide all or part of the &lt;a href=\"harmony\"&gt;harmony&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. the &lt;a href=\"guitar%20chord\"&gt;chords&lt;/a&gt; from a song's &lt;a href=\"chord%20progression\"&gt;chord progression&lt;/a&gt;, where a chord is a group of notes played together. Therefore, the basic technique of rhythm guitar is to hold down a &lt;a href=\"chord%20sequence\"&gt;series of chords&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"fret\"&gt;fret&lt;/a&gt;ting hand while &lt;a href=\"strumming\"&gt;strumming&lt;/a&gt; or fingerpicking rhythmically with the other hand. More developed rhythm techniques include &lt;a href=\"arpeggios\"&gt;arpeggios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Damping%20%28music%29%23Guitar\"&gt;damping&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"riffs\"&gt;riffs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chord%20solo\"&gt;chord solo&lt;/a&gt;s, and complex strums.\nIn ensembles or bands playing within the &lt;a href=\"Acoustic%20music\"&gt;acoustic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"country%20music\"&gt;country&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt; genres (among others), a guitarist playing the rhythm part of a composition plays the role of supporting the melodic lines and improvised solos played on the lead instrument or instruments, be they strings, wind, brass, keyboard or even percussion instruments, or simply the human voice, in the sense of playing steadily throughout the piece, whereas lead instruments and singers switch between carrying the main or countermelody and falling silent. In &lt;a href=\"big%20band\"&gt;big band&lt;/a&gt; music, the guitarist is considered part of the rhythm section, alongside bass and &lt;a href=\"drums\"&gt;drums&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn some musical situations, such as a solo singer-guitarist, the guitar &lt;a href=\"accompaniment\"&gt;accompaniment&lt;/a&gt; provides all the rhythmic drive; in large ensembles it may be only a small part (perhaps one element in a &lt;a href=\"polyrhythm\"&gt;polyrhythm&lt;/a&gt;). Likewise, rhythm guitar can supply all of the harmonic input to a singer-guitarist or small band, but in ensembles that have other harmony instruments (such as &lt;a href=\"Keyboard%20instrument\"&gt;keyboard&lt;/a&gt;s) or vocal harmonists, its harmonic input will be less important.\nIn the most commercially available and consumed genres, &lt;a href=\"electric%20guitar\"&gt;electric guitar&lt;/a&gt;s tend to dominate their &lt;a href=\"Acoustic%20guitar\"&gt;acoustic&lt;/a&gt; cousins in both the &lt;a href=\"recording%20studio\"&gt;recording studio&lt;/a&gt; and live venues. However the acoustic guitar remains a popular choice in &lt;a href=\"country%20music\"&gt;country&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Western%20music%20%28North%20America%29\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; and especially &lt;a href=\"bluegrass%20music\"&gt;bluegrass music&lt;/a&gt;, and almost exclusively in &lt;a href=\"folk%20music\"&gt;folk music&lt;/a&gt;.\nRock and pop.\nRock and pop rhythms.\nMost rhythms in rock and blues are based on 4/4 time with a &lt;a href=\"Beat%20%28music%29%23Backbeat\"&gt;backbeat&lt;/a&gt;; however, many variations are possible. A backbeat is a &lt;a href=\"syncopation\"&gt;syncopated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Accent%20%28music%29\"&gt;accentuation&lt;/a&gt; on the \"off\" beat. In a simple 4/4 rhythm these are beats 2 and 4. Emphasized back beat, a feature of some African styles, defined &lt;a href=\"rhythm%20and%20blues\"&gt;rhythm and blues&lt;/a&gt; recordings in the late 1940s and so became one of the defining characteristics of &lt;a href=\"rock%20and%20roll\"&gt;rock and roll&lt;/a&gt; and much of contemporary &lt;a href=\"popular%20music\"&gt;popular music&lt;/a&gt;.\nRock and pop harmony.\nHarmonically, in rock music, the most common way to construct chord progressions is to play major and minor \"&lt;a href=\"Triad%20%28music%29\"&gt;triads&lt;/a&gt;\", each comprising a root, third and fifth note of a given &lt;a href=\"scale%20%28music%29\"&gt;scale&lt;/a&gt;. An example of a major triad is C major, which contains the notes C, E and G. An example of a minor triad is the A minor chord, which includes the notes A, C and E. Interspersed are some four-note chords, which include the root, third and fifth, as well as a sixth, seventh or ninth note of the scale. The most common chord with four different notes is the &lt;a href=\"dominant%20seventh\"&gt;dominant seventh&lt;/a&gt; chord, which include a root, a major third above the root, a perfect fifth above the root and a flattened seventh. In the key of C major, the dominant seventh chord is a G7, which consists of the notes G, B, D and F. \n&lt;a href=\"Three-chord%20progression\"&gt;Three-chord progression&lt;/a&gt;s are common in earlier pop and rock, using various combinations of the I, IV and V chords, with the &lt;a href=\"twelve-bar%20blues\"&gt;twelve-bar blues&lt;/a&gt; particularly common. A four chord progression popular in the 1950s is I-vi-ii-V, which in the key of C major is the chords C major, a minor, d minor and G7. &lt;a href=\"Minor%20chord%20progression\"&gt;Minor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"modal%20chord%20progression\"&gt;modal chord progression&lt;/a&gt;s such as I-bVII-bVI (in the key of E, the chords E major, D major, C major) feature in popular music. \nIn &lt;a href=\"heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;heavy metal music&lt;/a&gt;, rhythm guitarists often play &lt;a href=\"power%20chord\"&gt;power chord&lt;/a&gt;s, which feature a root note and a fifth above, or with an octave doubling the root. There actually is no third of the chord. Power chords are usually played with &lt;a href=\"distortion%20%28music%29\"&gt;distortion&lt;/a&gt;.\nArpeggios.\nOne departure from the basic strummed chord technique is to play &lt;a href=\"arpeggio\"&gt;arpeggio&lt;/a&gt;s, i.e. to play individual notes in a chord separately. If this is rapidly done enough, listeners will still hear the sequence as harmony rather than melody. Arpeggiation is often used in folk, country, and heavy metal, sometimes in imitation of older &lt;a href=\"banjo\"&gt;banjo&lt;/a&gt; technique. It is also prominent in 1960s pop, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Animals\"&gt;The Animals&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun\"&gt;House of the Rising Sun&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"jangle%20pop\"&gt;jangle pop&lt;/a&gt; from the 1980s onwards. Rhythm guitarists who use arpeggio often favor &lt;a href=\"semi-acoustic\"&gt;semi-acoustic&lt;/a&gt; guitars and &lt;a href=\"twelve%20string%20guitar\"&gt;twelve string guitar&lt;/a&gt;s to get bright, undistorted \"jangly\" sound.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Soukous\"&gt;Soukous&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"TPOK%20Jazz\"&gt;TPOK Jazz&lt;/a&gt; additionally featured the unique role of \"mi-solo\", (meaning \"half solo\") guitarist, playing &lt;a href=\"arpeggio\"&gt;arpeggio&lt;/a&gt; patterns and filling a role \"between\" the lead and rhythm guitars.\nRiffs.\nIn some cases, the chord progression is implied with a simplified sequence of two or three notes, sometimes called a \"&lt;a href=\"riff\"&gt;riff&lt;/a&gt;\". That sequence is repeated throughout the composition. In &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; music, this is typically expanded to more complex sequences comprising a combination of chords, single notes and &lt;a href=\"palm%20muting\"&gt;palm muting&lt;/a&gt;. The rhythm guitar part in compositions performed by more technically oriented bands often include riffs employing complex lead guitar techniques. In some genres, especially metal, the audio signal from the rhythm guitar's output is often subsequently heavily distorted by overdriving the guitar's &lt;a href=\"guitar%20amplifier\"&gt;amplifier&lt;/a&gt; to create a thicker, \"crunchier\" sound for the palm-muted rhythms.\nInteraction with other guitarists.\nIn bands with two or more guitarists, the guitarists may exchange or even duplicate roles for various songs or several &lt;a href=\"Section%20%28music%29\"&gt;sections&lt;/a&gt; within a song. In those with a single guitarist, the guitarist may play lead and rhythm at numerous times or simultaneously, by overlaying the rhythm sequence with a lead line.\nCrossover with keyboards.\nThe availability of electronic &lt;a href=\"effects%20unit\"&gt;effects unit&lt;/a&gt;s such as delay pedals and reverb units enables electric guitarists to play arpeggios and take over some of the role of a synthesizer player in performing sustained \"pads\". Those serve as sonic backgrounds in modern pop. Creating a pad sound differs from usual rhythm guitar roles in that it is not rhythmic. Some bands have a &lt;a href=\"synthesizer\"&gt;synthesizer&lt;/a&gt; performer play pads. In bands without a synth player, a guitarist can take over this role.\nReplacing lead guitar.\nSome rhythm techniques cross over into &lt;a href=\"lead%20guitar\"&gt;lead guitar&lt;/a&gt; playing. In guitar-bass-and-drums &lt;a href=\"power%20trio\"&gt;power trio&lt;/a&gt;s guitarists must double up between rhythm and lead. For instance &lt;a href=\"Jimi%20Hendrix\"&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;/a&gt; combined full chords with solo &lt;a href=\"lick%20%28music%29\"&gt;lick&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"double%20stop\"&gt;double stop&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arpeggio\"&gt;arpeggio&lt;/a&gt;s. In the 2010s, \"&lt;a href=\"Tape%20loop%23Loop%20Pedals\"&gt;looping pedal&lt;/a&gt;s\" are used to record a chord sequence or riff over which musicians can then play the lead line, simulating the sound achieved by having two guitarists.\nEquipment.\nRhythm guitarists usually aim to generate a stronger rhythmic and chordal sound, in contrast to the lead guitarists' goal of producing a sustained, high-pitched melody line that listeners can hear over the top of the band. As a result, rhythm and lead players may use different guitars and amplifiers. Rhythm guitarists may employ an electric &lt;a href=\"semi-acoustic%20guitar\"&gt;acoustic guitar&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"humbucker\"&gt;humbucker&lt;/a&gt;-equipped electric guitar for a richer and fatter output. Also, rhythm guitarists may use strings of a larger gauge than those used by lead guitarists. However, while these may be practices, they are not necessarily the rule and are subject to the style of the song and the preference of the individual guitarist.\nWhile rhythm guitarists in metal bands use distortion effects, they tend to use less of the modulation effects such as &lt;a href=\"Flanging\"&gt;flangers&lt;/a&gt; used by lead guitar players. Whereas the lead guitarist in a metal band is trying to make the solo tone more prominent, and thus uses a range of colorful effects, the rhythm guitarist is typically trying to provide a thick, solid supporting sound that blends in with the overall sound of the group. In alternative rock and post punk bands, however, where the band is trying to create an ambient soundscape rather than an aggressive &lt;a href=\"Mot%C3%B6rhead\"&gt;Mot\u00f6rhead&lt;/a&gt;-style \"&lt;a href=\"Wall%20of%20Sound\"&gt;Wall of Sound&lt;/a&gt;\", the rhythm guitarist may use flanging and delay effects to create a shimmering background.\nJazz.\nRhythm guitar has been especially important in the development of jazz. The guitar took over the role previously occupied by the banjo to provide rhythmic chordal accompaniment.\nEarly jazz guitarists like Freddie Green tended to emphasize the percussive quality of the instrument. The ability to keep a steady rhythm while playing through complicated chord patterns made the guitar invaluable to many rhythm sections. Jazz guitarists are expected to have deep knowledge of harmony.\nJazz harmony.\n&lt;a href=\"Jazz%20guitar\"&gt;Jazz guitar&lt;/a&gt;ists use their knowledge of &lt;a href=\"harmony\"&gt;harmony&lt;/a&gt; and jazz theory to create jazz chord &lt;a href=\"Voicing%20%28music%29\"&gt;\"voicings\"&lt;/a&gt;, which emphasize the 3rd and 7th notes of the chord. Unlike pop and rock guitarists, who typically include the root of a chord (even, with many open chords and barre chords, doubling the root), jazz guitarists typically omit the root. Some more sophisticated chord voicings also include the 9th, 11th, and 13th notes of the chord. A typical jazz voicing for the chord G7 would be the individual notes B, E, F, and A. This voicing uses the 3rd (the note B), the 7th (the note F), along with the 6th (the note E) and the 9th (the note A).\nIn some modern jazz styles, &lt;a href=\"dominant%207th\"&gt;dominant 7th&lt;/a&gt; chords in a tune may contain altered 9ths (either flattened by a semitone, which is called a \"flat 9th\", or sharpened by a semitone, which is called a \"sharp 9th\"); 11ths (sharpened by a semitone, which is called a \"sharp 11th\"); 13ths (typically flattened by a semitone, which is called a \"flat 13th\").\nJazz guitarists need to learn about a range of different chords, including &lt;a href=\"major%207th\"&gt;major 7th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"major%206th\"&gt;major 6th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minor%207th\"&gt;minor 7th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minor/major%20seventh\"&gt;minor/major 7th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dominant%207th\"&gt;dominant 7th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diminished%20seventh%20chord\"&gt;diminished&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"half-diminished%20seventh%20chord\"&gt;half-diminished&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"augmented%20chord\"&gt;augmented chord&lt;/a&gt;s. As well, they need to learn about chord transformations (e.g., altered chords, such as \"alt dominant chords\" described above), &lt;a href=\"chord%20substitution\"&gt;chord substitution&lt;/a&gt;s, and re-harmonization techniques. Some jazz guitarists use their knowledge of jazz scales and chords to provide a &lt;a href=\"walking%20bass\"&gt;walking bass&lt;/a&gt;-style accompaniment.\nJazz guitarists learn to perform these chords over the range of different &lt;a href=\"chord%20progression\"&gt;chord progression&lt;/a&gt;s used in jazz, such as the II-V-I progression, the jazz-style &lt;a href=\"12%20bar%20blues\"&gt;blues progression&lt;/a&gt;, the minor jazz-style blues form, the \"&lt;a href=\"rhythm%20changes\"&gt;rhythm changes&lt;/a&gt;\" progression, and the variety of chord progressions used in jazz ballads, and &lt;a href=\"jazz%20standard\"&gt;jazz standard&lt;/a&gt;s. Guitarists may also learn to use the chord types, strumming styles, and &lt;a href=\"effects%20pedal\"&gt;effects pedal&lt;/a&gt;s (e.g., &lt;a href=\"chorus%20effect\"&gt;chorus effect&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Distortion%20%28music%29\"&gt;fuzzbox&lt;/a&gt;) used in 1970s-era jazz-Latin, jazz-funk, and jazz-rock fusion music.\nBig band rhythm.\nIn jazz &lt;a href=\"big%20band\"&gt;big band&lt;/a&gt;s, popular during the 1930s and 1940s, the guitarist is considered an integral part of the rhythm section (guitar, &lt;a href=\"drum\"&gt;drum&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Double%20bass\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt;). They usually played a regular four chords to the bar, although an amount of harmonic improvisation is possible. &lt;a href=\"Freddie%20Green\"&gt;Freddie Green&lt;/a&gt;, guitarist in the &lt;a href=\"Count%20Basie\"&gt;Count Basie&lt;/a&gt; orchestra, was a noted exponent of this style. The harmonies are often minimal; for instance, the &lt;a href=\"root%20%28chord%29\"&gt;root note&lt;/a&gt; is often omitted on the assumption that it will be supplied by the bassist.\nSmall group comping.\nWhen jazz guitarists play chords underneath a song's melody or another musician's solo improvisations, it is called \"&lt;a href=\"Comping%20%28jazz%29\"&gt;comping&lt;/a&gt;\", short for \"accompanying\". The accompanying style in most jazz styles differs from the way chordal instruments accompany in many popular styles of music. In many popular styles of music, such as rock and pop, the rhythm guitarist usually performs the chords in rhythmic fashion which sets out the beat or groove of a tune. In contrast, in many modern jazz styles within smaller, the guitarist plays much more sparsely, intermingling periodic chords and delicate voicings into pauses in the melody or solo, and using periods of silence. Jazz guitarists commonly use a wide variety of &lt;a href=\"Inversion%20%28music%29\"&gt;inversions&lt;/a&gt; when comping, rather than only using standard voicings.\nGypsy pumping.\n&lt;a href=\"Gypsy%20jazz\"&gt;Gypsy jazz&lt;/a&gt; is acoustic music, usually played without a drummer. Rhythm guitar in &lt;a href=\"gypsy%20jazz\"&gt;gypsy jazz&lt;/a&gt; uses a special form of &lt;a href=\"strumming\"&gt;strumming&lt;/a&gt; known as \"&lt;a href=\"la%20pompe\"&gt;la pompe&lt;/a&gt;\", i.e. \"the pump\". This form of percussive rhythm is similar to the \"boom-chick\" in bluegrass styles; it is what gives the music its fast swinging feeling. The strumming hand, which never touches the top of the guitar, must make a quick up-down strum followed by a down strum. The up-down part of la pompe must be done extremely fast, regardless of the tempo of the music. It is very similar to a grace note in classical music, albeit the fact that an entire chord is used. This pattern is usually played in unison by two or more guitarists in the rhythm section.\nJazz chord soloing.\nJazz guitar soloists are not limited to playing single notes by their instrument. This allows them to create \"chord solos\" by adding the song's melody on top of the chord voicings. &lt;a href=\"Wes%20Montgomery\"&gt;Wes Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; was noted for playing successive choruses in single notes, octaves and finally a chord solo. This technique differs from chord-melody soloing in that it is not intended to be used unaccompanied\nFunk.\nFunk utilized the same &lt;a href=\"extended%20chords\"&gt;extended chords&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"bebop\"&gt;bebop&lt;/a&gt; jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. However, unlike bebop jazz, with its complex, rapid-fire chord changes, funk virtually abandoned chord changes, creating static single chord &lt;a href=\"vamp%20%28music%29\"&gt;vamps&lt;/a&gt; with little harmonic movement, but with a complex and driving rhythmic feel. Some have &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; backgrounds. The chords used in funk songs typically imply a &lt;a href=\"dorian%20mode\"&gt;dorian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mixolydian%20mode\"&gt;mixolydian mode&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to the major or natural minor tonalities of most popular music. Melodic content was derived by mixing these modes with the &lt;a href=\"blues%20scale\"&gt;blues scale&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn funk bands, guitarists typically play in a percussive style, often using the &lt;a href=\"Wah-wah%20pedal\"&gt;wah-wah&lt;/a&gt; sound effect and muting the notes in their riffs to create a percussive sound. Guitarists &lt;a href=\"Ernie%20Isley\"&gt;Ernie Isley&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Isley%20Brothers\"&gt;The Isley Brothers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Hazel\"&gt;Eddie Hazel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Funkadelic\"&gt;Funkadelic&lt;/a&gt; were notably influenced by &lt;a href=\"Jimi%20Hendrix\"&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;/a&gt;'s improvised solos. Eddie Hazel, who worked with George Clinton, is a notable guitar soloist in funk. Ernie Isley was tutored at an early age by Jimi Hendrix himself, when he was a part of The Isley Brothers backing band and lived in the attic temporarily at the Isleys' household. &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Nolen\"&gt;Jimmy Nolen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phelps%20Collins\"&gt;Phelps Collins&lt;/a&gt; are famous funk rhythm guitarists who both worked with &lt;a href=\"James%20Brown\"&gt;James Brown&lt;/a&gt;.\nReggae.\nThe &lt;a href=\"guitar\"&gt;guitar&lt;/a&gt; in reggae usually plays the chords on beats two and four, a musical figure known as &lt;a href=\"skank%20%28guitar%29\"&gt;skank&lt;/a&gt; or the 'bang'. It has a very dampened, short and scratchy &lt;a href=\"chop%20chord\"&gt;chop&lt;/a&gt; sound, almost like a percussion instrument. Sometimes a double chop is used when the guitar still plays the off beats, but also plays the following 16th or 8th beat on the up-stroke. Depending on the amount of swing or groove, this next secondary stab is often the 16th note sounding closer to an 8th placement in the rhythm. An example is the intro to \"&lt;a href=\"Stir%20It%20Up\"&gt;Stir It Up&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"The%20Wailers\"&gt;The Wailers&lt;/a&gt;. Artist and producer &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20Harriott\"&gt;Derrick Harriott&lt;/a&gt; says, \"What happened was the musical thing was real widespread, but only among a certain sort of people. It was always a down-town thing, but more than just hearing the music. The equipment was so powerful and the vibe so strong that we feel it.\" Reggae chords are typically played without overdrive or distortion."
