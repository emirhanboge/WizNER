    "text": " \nPeople in Conflict was an afternoon program that appeared on &lt;a href=\"CTV%20Television%20Network\"&gt;CTV Television Network&lt;/a&gt; every weekday from October 1, 1962 through September 11, 1970. It ran for half an hour and covered two different stories of real people suffering from emotional crises. It was originally produced in the Vancouver CTV affiliate &lt;a href=\"CHAN-TV\"&gt;CHAN-TV&lt;/a&gt; but was moved to &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"CFCF-TV\"&gt;CFCF-TV&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1960s to take advantage of the new colour television cameras.\nThe show was later produced in Australia by John Pond and Channel 7."
