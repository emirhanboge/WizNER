    "text": "The Nationalist Republican Party (, PRN, usually called \"Nationalists\") was a &lt;a href=\"right-wing%20politics\"&gt;right-wing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Portuguese%20Republic\"&gt;First Portuguese Republic&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded as a merger of the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Portugal%29\"&gt;Republican Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reconstitution%20Party\"&gt;Reconstitution Party&lt;/a&gt; and some elements of the old &lt;a href=\"National%20Republican%20Party%20%28Portugal%29\"&gt;National Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sid%C3%B3nio%20Pais\"&gt;Sid\u00f3nio Pais&lt;/a&gt;. Initially with moderate conservative orientation, it drifted increasingly to the right, making concessions to Catholic constituencies towards the end of the First Republic.\nHistory.\nAfter the leader of the Republican Liberal Party (PRL), &lt;a href=\"Ant%C3%B3nio%20Granjo\"&gt;Ant\u00f3nio Granjo&lt;/a&gt;, was assassinated in the \"&lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Night\"&gt;Bloody Night&lt;/a&gt;\" of 19 October 1921, the Liberals and Reconstituents started negotiations to merge the two parties in 1922. On 7 February 1923, the public manifesto of the Nationalist Republican Party was finally signed. The party constituted a \"bloc of the Rights\", intended to incorporate both conservative republicans and frustrated monarchists. It was designed to challenge the power of then hegemonic &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28Portugal%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;. The adherents of PRN were predominantly proprietors, shopkeepers, militaries, public servants, physicians, and lawyers. It held close links with the &lt;a href=\"Banco%20Nacional%20Ultramarino\"&gt;Banco Nacional Ultramarino&lt;/a&gt; and other important banks and major corporations.\nOn 15 November 1923, the Nationalists formed a government, led by &lt;a href=\"Ant%C3%B3nio%20Ginestal%20Machado\"&gt;Ant\u00f3nio Ginestal Machado&lt;/a&gt;. It included &lt;a href=\"%C3%93scar%20Carmona\"&gt;\u00d3scar Carmona&lt;/a&gt;, future president of the &lt;a href=\"Estado%20Novo%20%28Portugal%29\"&gt;Estado Novo&lt;/a&gt;, as minister of war and lasted one month. In December 1923, &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lvaro%20de%20Castro\"&gt;\u00c1lvaro de Castro&lt;/a&gt; left the PRN to form a new government, which did not include Nationalists, but Democrats, independents and members of the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Cornfield\"&gt;New Cornfield&lt;/a&gt;\". De Castro's government, which lasted until July 1924, was opposed by the PRN, most outspokenly by &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Cunha%20Leal\"&gt;Francisco Cunha Leal&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable leaders of the Nationalist Republican Party, besides Machado, included &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A9%20de%20Barros%20Queir%C3%B3s\"&gt;Tom\u00e9 de Barros Queir\u00f3s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BAlio%20Dantas\"&gt;J\u00falio Dantas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mendes%20Cabe%C3%A7adas\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mendes Cabe\u00e7adas&lt;/a&gt;, Cunha Leal, who left to found the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Republican%20Union\"&gt;Liberal Republican Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1926, and, after 1925, Commander &lt;a href=\"Filomeno%20da%20C%C3%A2mara%20de%20Melo%20Cabral\"&gt;Filomeno da C\u00e2mara de Melo Cabral&lt;/a&gt;, one of the organisers of the 18 April 1925 Generals' Coup.\nThe secession of the Liberal Republican Union in March 1926, and the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Ditadura%20Nacional\"&gt;Ditadura Nacional&lt;/a&gt; at the end of May of the same year, marked the end of the Nationalist Republican Party. In the early 1930s many former members of the PRN joined the &lt;a href=\"National%20Union%20%28Portugal%29\"&gt;National Union&lt;/a&gt;, ruling party of the &lt;a href=\"Estado%20Novo%20%28Portugal%29\"&gt;Estado Novo&lt;/a&gt;."
