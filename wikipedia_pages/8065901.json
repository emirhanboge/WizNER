    "text": "Kedah Darul Aman Football Club () is a &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Alor%20Setar\"&gt;Alor Setar&lt;/a&gt;, Kedah, that competes in the &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;Malaysia Super League&lt;/a&gt;. They are the only team in the history of Malaysian football to have won two &lt;a href=\"Treble%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;trebles&lt;/a&gt;: in &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;2006\u201307&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;2007\u201308&lt;/a&gt;. The club is managed by Darulaman Football Club Sdn Bhd.\nHistory.\nThe football team was founded in 1924 by Tunku Yaacob ibni &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Hamid%20Halim%20of%20Kedah\"&gt;Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah&lt;/a&gt; as president, though they only had limited success until the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Basri%20Akil\"&gt;Ahmad Basri Akil&lt;/a&gt; as manager in 1985. Under &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Basri%20Akil\"&gt;Ahmad Basri Akil&lt;/a&gt;, the club qualified for six &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Cup\"&gt;Malaysia Cup&lt;/a&gt; final matches in a seven-year period between 1987 and 1993; and won two &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Cup\"&gt;Malaysia Cup&lt;/a&gt; titles, one league title and one &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; title.\nThe club experienced a lean period in the 1980s and 1990s, but enjoyed a revival in the new millennium by achieving back-to-back domestic trebles under &lt;a href=\"Mohd%20Azraai%20Khor%20Abdullah\"&gt;Azraai Khor&lt;/a&gt;. However, the club experienced a dip in performances thereafter as a result of the loss of their influential import players; including &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20San%20Mart%C3%ADn\"&gt;Nelson San Mart\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cornelius%20Huggins\"&gt;Cornelius Huggins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marlon%20James%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Marlon James&lt;/a&gt;. Problems with the new management team also led to Azraai Khor's departure.\nThe club were relegated to the second-tier of Malaysian football, the &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Malaysian Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, after losing 3\u20132 in the playoff final to &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Pahang%20F.C.\"&gt;Sri Pahang&lt;/a&gt; in a penalty shootout during the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;2012 Super League season season&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Marijo%20Tot\"&gt;Marijo Tot&lt;/a&gt; was hired to replace &lt;a href=\"Wan%20Jamak%20Wan%20Hassan\"&gt;Wan Jamak&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to bring the club back to Malaysia Super League during the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Malaysia%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2013 Premier League season&lt;/a&gt;, which also saw the return of former Kedah Darul Aman's talisman, &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20San%20Mart%C3%ADn\"&gt;Nelson San Mart\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Malaysia%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2014 season&lt;/a&gt; the club signed &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Mehmet\"&gt;Billy Mehmet&lt;/a&gt;, who made an immediate impact. He helped the club reach the semi-final of the Malaysia Cup, winning the first leg 3\u20131, but ultimately lost the second leg 5\u20131. Billy Mehmet ended the season as the club's top goal scorer in the Malaysia Premier League as well as the club's top goal scorer in all competitions. He was also the second highest goal scorer in all competitions at all levels in Malaysian professional football.\nPrior to the 2021 season, the club changed its name from Kedah FA to Kedah Darul Aman F.C.\nCrest and colours.\nKedah Darul Aman Football Club's traditional colours are red and black, but the home kit's colours have been green and yellow since 1988. The colours were the result of the former Kedah Football Association Deputy President, &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Basri%20Akil\"&gt;Ahmad Basri Akil&lt;/a&gt;'s request for a different set of colours for the home kit. The colours of green and yellow were chosen as they referenced the state's nickname of \"Jelapang Padi\" or \"Paddy field\". \nThe current club crest were announced by &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Basri%20Akil\"&gt;Ahmad Basri Akil&lt;/a&gt; alongside the club's official colours of green and yellow in 1988. Green dominates the background; the side of the crest shows 11 joint bordered lines which signify the 11 districts of the Kedah state. At the centre of the crest is a ball and &lt;a href=\"Allamanda\"&gt;Allamanda&lt;/a&gt; flowers; as the flower is green and yellow in colour, with the team motto () written in yellow.\nStadium.\nThe club is currently based at the all-seater &lt;a href=\"Darul%20Aman%20Stadium\"&gt;Darul Aman Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Alor%20Setar\"&gt;Alor Setar&lt;/a&gt;, Kedah. It has a capacity of 32,387 seats and was opened in 1962.\nClub culture.\nSupporters.\nThe song \"Biar Jasa Jadi Kenangan\", once again idealised and written by &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Basri%20Akil\"&gt;Ahmad Basri Akil&lt;/a&gt; and famously recorded by a Malaysian musician Freddie Fernandez, is the anthem of the club, and has been sung by the crowd since 9 September 1987 after the club reached their first &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Cup\"&gt;Malaysia Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-final match since 1940. This famous song is sung by the club's fanatic fans to boost their beloved players' morale. The well-known and popular chants among the club supporters is \"Pulun Kedah Pulun\".
