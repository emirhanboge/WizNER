    "text": "The Stevens\u2013Bruxner ministry (1932\u20131935) or First Stevens\u2013Bruxner ministry or First Stevens ministry was the 46th ministry of the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Government\"&gt;New South Wales Government&lt;/a&gt;, and was led by the 25th &lt;a href=\"Premier%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bertram%20Stevens%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Bertram Stevens&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href=\"United%20Australia%20Party\"&gt;United Australia Party&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Coalition%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"National%20Party%20of%20Australia%20%E2%80%93%20NSW\"&gt;Country Party&lt;/a&gt;, that was led by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant-Colonel\"&gt;Lieutenant-Colonel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Bruxner\"&gt;Michael Bruxner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Service%20Order\"&gt;DSO&lt;/a&gt;. The ministry was one of three occasions when the Government was led by Stevens, as Premier; and one of four occasions where Bruxner served as Deputy Premier.\nStevens was first elected to the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;New South Wales Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in 1927 and served continuously until 1940. Having served as a senior minister in the &lt;a href=\"Bavin%20ministry\"&gt;Bavin ministry&lt;/a&gt;, following the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Nationalist%20Party%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Nationalist&lt;/a&gt; coalition led by Bavin, who was in poor health, at the &lt;a href=\"1930%20New%20South%20Wales%20state%20election\"&gt;1930 state election&lt;/a&gt;, Stevens was elected leader of the newly formed United Australia Party in New South Wales and became &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29\"&gt;Leader of the Opposition&lt;/a&gt;. Bruxner was first elected to the Assembly in 1920 and served continuously until 1962. Initially a member of the &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Party%20%281920%29\"&gt;Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;, he served as &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20New%20South%20Wales%20National%20Party\"&gt;party leader&lt;/a&gt; in opposition between 1922 and 1925; and resumed leadership in 1932, following the resignation of his successor, &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Buttenshaw\"&gt;Ernest Buttenshaw&lt;/a&gt;. By this stage, the party was renamed as the Country Party.\nThis ministry covers the period from 13 May 1932 when, as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Lang%20Dismissal%20Crisis\"&gt;Lang Dismissal Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Governor of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Game\"&gt;Philip Game&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"reserve%20power\"&gt;reserve power&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crown\"&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt; to remove &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Lang%20%28Australian%20politician%29\"&gt;Jack Lang&lt;/a&gt; as Premier. The ministry served until 10 February 1935 when the &lt;a href=\"1935%20New%20South%20Wales%20state%20election\"&gt;1935 state election&lt;/a&gt; saw the Stevens\u2013Bruxner coalition re-elected for a subsequent term.\nComposition of ministry.\nIn the first arrangement, lasting just two days, Stevens was the only Member of Government pending formation of the full ministry as a result of the turmoil following the dismissal of Lang and his &lt;a href=\"Lang%20ministry%20%281930-1932%29\"&gt;third ministry&lt;/a&gt;. The composition of the ministry was announced by Premier Stevens on 16 May 1932 and covers a period of a little over one month as an \"emergency ministry\" up until 17 June 1932 when the outcome of the &lt;a href=\"1932%20New%20South%20Wales%20state%20election\"&gt;1932 state election&lt;/a&gt; was determined. At that point, a minor reshuffle of the ministry was effected.\nMinisters are members of the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; unless otherwise noted.\nReferences.\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-top: 5px solid #cccccc\" | &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Council%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales government ministries&lt;/a&gt;"
