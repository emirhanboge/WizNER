    "text": "\"You're Beautiful\" is a song recorded by Australian singer-songwriter &lt;a href=\"Nathaniel%20Willemse\"&gt;Nathaniel Willemse&lt;/a&gt;. It was released on 28 February 2014 as the second single from his debut studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Yours%20%28Nathaniel%20album%29\"&gt;Yours&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTwo remixes of the song were released on 13 June 2014.\nBackground.\nIn February 2014, Willemse announced his new single would be titled \"You're Beautiful\" and would be the follow up to the double platinum-selling single \"&lt;a href=\"You%20%28Nathaniel%20Willemse%20song%29\"&gt;You&lt;/a&gt;\". Speaking to Auspop in March, Willemse said, \"We wanted to make sure that it was in the same realm as 'You', but have points of difference. We looked at &lt;a href=\"Lorde\"&gt;Lorde&lt;/a&gt; and almost all of Lorde's songs are identical or close to being the same type of sound. So we didn't want to sway too much\". He continued, \"I've had feedback from friends and other people who've said it sounds exactly the same as 'You'. It doesn't sound exactly the same. It's in that same area stylistically in sound and vision terms. We wanted to follow through with that &lt;a href=\"falsetto\"&gt;falsetto&lt;/a&gt; vibe, but we wanted to make it a bit edgier, a bit ballsier and with a bit more lyrical depth.\" \"You're Beautiful\" debuted at number 14 on the &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Charts\"&gt;ARIA Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; on 10 March 2014.\nMusic video.\nThe official video clip was released on 28 February 2014 via Willemse's &lt;a href=\"VEVO\"&gt;VEVO&lt;/a&gt; account."
