Indians also make up the largest minority ethnic group in the UAE, making up roughly 38% of UAE's total residents.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nSince 3000 B.C, relations between &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and the seven emirates which now make up the &lt;a href=\"United%20Arab%20Emirates\"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; were traditionally close. The UAE and India had enjoyed close and friendly ties based on historic and cultural ties. People-to-people contacts and barter trade for clothes and spices from India in exchange for dates and pearls from the region have existed for centuries. After the creation of the Federation in 1971, India-UAE relations flourished. Today UAE and India share political, economical, and cultural links. There are over a million &lt;a href=\"Indians%20in%20the%20United%20Arab%20Emirates\"&gt;Indians in the United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;, being by far the largest migrant group in the country.[1]\n21st century.\nPrime Minister &lt;a href=\"Manmohan%20Singh\"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; visited Abu Dhabi in March 2013.

In 2018, a &lt;a href=\"Memorandum%20of%20understanding\"&gt;Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)&lt;/a&gt; was signed between &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Arab%20Emirates\"&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt; on Technical Cooperation in the &lt;a href=\"Rail%20transport\"&gt;Rail&lt;/a&gt; Sector. It provided a platform for &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Railways\"&gt;Indian Railways&lt;/a&gt; to interact and share their latest developments and knowledge in the railway sector. On 18 August 2018, Modi described Sheikh Mohammed's humanitarian support for those affected by the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Kerala%20floods\"&gt;Kerala floods that year&lt;/a&gt; as \"[reflecting] the special ties between governments and people of India and UAE\". On 6 August 2019, the UAE backed the decision of the Indian government to pursue passage of the &lt;a href=\"Jammu%20and%20Kashmir%20Reorganisation%20Bill%2C%202019\"&gt;2019 Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill&lt;/a&gt;, with the UAE's Ambassador to India stating: \"We expect that the changes would improve social justice and security and confidence of the people in the local governance and will encourage further stability and peace.\"\nIn August, 2021, UAE and India signed an agreement under which faculty members from Indian universities will spend six to 10 months every year for undertaking research and teaching social sciences in Abu Dhabi.

In December 2020, Indian authorities in coordination with UAE had foiled a Pakistani &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Services%20Intelligence\"&gt;ISI&lt;/a&gt; backed-terrorist attack in Delhi. The arrested terrorists consisted of 2 &lt;a href=\"Khalistan%20movement\"&gt;Khalistani&lt;/a&gt; and 3 &lt;a href=\"Hizbul%20Mujahideen\"&gt;Hizbul Mujahideen&lt;/a&gt; members.
