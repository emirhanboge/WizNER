    "text": "JCreator is a &lt;a href=\"Java%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Integrated%20development%20environment\"&gt;IDE&lt;/a&gt; created by Xinox Software. Its interface is similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Microsoft%20Corporation\"&gt;Microsoft's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Visual%20Studio\"&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Because it is programmed entirely in &lt;a href=\"C%2B%2B\"&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt;, (except the first version (0.1), which was Java-based ), Xinox Software has asserted that JCreator is faster than competing Java-based Java IDEs.\nJCreator has three editions:\nJCreator is only available on the Windows operating system. However, both the LE and Pro versions of JCreator run adequately on &lt;a href=\"Linux\"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; (using &lt;a href=\"Wine%20%28software%29\"&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt;). So far no Linux versions are planned for immediate release, but new components will be built for cross-compatibility in mind.\nThe feature set of the Pro version is comparable to that of other language aware IDEs with respect to project management and editing features, but lacks advanced features, such as automated &lt;a href=\"refactoring\"&gt;refactoring&lt;/a&gt;, support for common frameworks etc., which can be found in the dominant Java IDEs such as &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20%28software%29\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"IntelliJ%20IDEA\"&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;. The free LE version further lacks some features, such as &lt;a href=\"code%20completion\"&gt;code completion&lt;/a&gt;, that are included with other free IDEs. Unlike the dominant Java IDEs today, JCreator also lacks the level of extensibility through third-party plugins that is common in popular Java IDEs.\nPro vs LE.\nSome of the features missing from the freeware edition (Version 3) include:"
