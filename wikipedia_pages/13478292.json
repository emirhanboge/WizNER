    "title": "Tangled Up (Girls Aloud album)",
    "text": "Tangled Up is the fourth studio album by English-Irish &lt;a href=\"girl%20group\"&gt;girl group&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Girls%20Aloud\"&gt;Girls Aloud&lt;/a&gt;. It was released through &lt;a href=\"Fascination%20Records\"&gt;Fascination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Polydor%20Records\"&gt;Polydor Records&lt;/a&gt; on 16 November 2007, and distributed in two physical formats and available for &lt;a href=\"Music%20download\"&gt;digital consumption&lt;/a&gt;. The record was produced by &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Higgins%20%28producer%29\"&gt;Brian Higgins&lt;/a&gt; and production team &lt;a href=\"Xenomania\"&gt;Xenomania&lt;/a&gt;; the band members earned songwriting credits for two tracks. Production and development began with each member meeting with Higgins to discuss their personal and professional experiences since the release of their third album \"&lt;a href=\"Chemistry%20%28Girls%20Aloud%20album%29\"&gt;Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;\" (2005). It was recorded separately between April and July 2007.\nAccording to member &lt;a href=\"Cheryl%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Cheryl&lt;/a&gt;, \"Tangled Up\" emphasizes a more mature nature than their previous efforts. Musically, it is a &lt;a href=\"Pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; album that incorporates elements of &lt;a href=\"dance-pop\"&gt;dance-pop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"synthpop\"&gt;synthpop&lt;/a&gt;, and various &lt;a href=\"electronic%20dance%20music\"&gt;EDM&lt;/a&gt; sub-genres. Lyrically, it delves into themes of love, relationships and femininity. Majority of the numbers consists of synthesizers, drum machines, electric and acoustic guitars, and keyboards, whilst it was the group's first experimentation with tools such as &lt;a href=\"autotune\"&gt;autotune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vocoder\"&gt;vocoder&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon its release, \"Tangled Up\" received universal acclaim from &lt;a href=\"Music%20journalism\"&gt;music critics&lt;/a&gt;, who commended the dance-oriented sound, songwriting and fun production. However, minor criticism was aimed towards certain inclusions on the record. Despite this, \"Tangled Up\" has been identified by numerous commentators as Girls Aloud and Xenomania's best work. Commercially, it experienced success in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, peaking at number four, and was certified platinum by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Phonographic%20Industry\"&gt;British Phonographic Industry&lt;/a&gt; (BPI) for shipments of 300,000 units. It performed moderately in Ireland, reaching number 25, and was certified gold by the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Recorded%20Music%20Association\"&gt;Irish Recorded Music Association&lt;/a&gt; (IRMA) for 7,500 claimed sales.\nIn order to promote the album, Girls Aloud conducted a series of promotional activities such as television, commercial and magazine appearances. Three singles were released from the record: \"&lt;a href=\"Sexy%21%20No%20No%20No...\"&gt;Sexy! No No No...&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Call%20the%20Shots\"&gt;Call the Shots&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Can%27t%20Speak%20French\"&gt;Can't Speak French&lt;/a&gt;\", all achieving critical and commercial success in Europe. Furthermore, the girl group embarked on their &lt;a href=\"Tangled%20Up%20Tour\"&gt;Tangled Up Tour&lt;/a&gt; which saw them tour in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Like the album, it achieved critical and commercial acclaim, and a live DVD was distributed on 27 October 2008.\nBackground and development.\nIn April 2007, the group announced that they would release a new studio album in November of that year. Initial ideas started in March of that year where each member met with British producer &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Higgins%20%28producer%29\"&gt;Brian Higgins&lt;/a&gt;, who had worked with them together on their previous records. Each singer visited Higgins at his home in England and discussed their experiences and life endeavours after the release of the third Girls Aloud studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Chemistry%20%28Girls%20Aloud%20album%29\"&gt;Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;\" (2005); to his advantage, he decided to take inspiration from those discussions and work further on the new record, along with his production team &lt;a href=\"Xenomania\"&gt;Xenomania&lt;/a&gt;. Member &lt;a href=\"Nicola%20Roberts\"&gt;Nicola Roberts&lt;/a&gt; reaffirmed that it was important for Higgins to be \"up to date with where [Girls Aloud are] at,\" and further commented, \"Our songs have to reflect us so that's why we do it.\" Moreover, when asked in an interview with &lt;a href=\"Fascination%20Records\"&gt;Fascination Records&lt;/a&gt; about what fans and critics could expect from the album, member &lt;a href=\"Cheryl%20%28entertainer%29\"&gt;Cheryl&lt;/a&gt; said they were heading for a \"more mature direction.\" She also believed that the ideal focus for the record was not to sing \"about things that we would have when we were 16. Now we're singing about things that you talk about in your early 20s.\"\nIn late March 2007, Higgins and Xenomania started crafting demo songs for the girl group to record, which commenced the following month. However, Higgins provided the demos for member &lt;a href=\"Nadine%20Coyle\"&gt;Nadine Coyle&lt;/a&gt; to solely record as she had moved to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt; that year; the motive was to allow Coyle to choose what sounds and sections from each song worked for her. Subsequently, she recorded the tracks in Los Angeles once Higgins mastered the final versions. According to member &lt;a href=\"Kimberley%20Walsh\"&gt;Kimberley Walsh&lt;/a&gt;, it took Girls Aloud six months to finish recording the album, which she found \"unusual\" for the group. Furthermore, she noted that sessions for their previous albums would take a \"matter of weeks\", but took longer because the members wanted to experiment more with the production; moreover, recording had to be halted due the group embarking on their &lt;a href=\"The%20Greatest%20Hits%20Tour%20%28Girls%20Aloud%29\"&gt;Greatest Hits Tour&lt;/a&gt; and promotion of the lead single \"&lt;a href=\"Sexy%21%20No%20No%20No...\"&gt;Sexy! No No No...&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Tangled Up\" was finished in October 2007, and was mastered by Higgins himself, with the help of Dick Beetham of 360 Masterings.\nComposition and themes.\nUnlike the group's previous records, \"Tangled Up\" is a \"non stop\" &lt;a href=\"pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; album that consistently incorporates elements of &lt;a href=\"electropop\"&gt;electropop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dance%20music\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt; music, &lt;a href=\"Europop\"&gt;Europop&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"Electronic%20dance%20music\"&gt;EDM&lt;/a&gt; sub-genres. Regarding the sound and production, Alexis Petridis of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" noted that the material was \"witty, diverse\" and \"experimental\", whilst &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Spy\"&gt;Digital Spy&lt;/a&gt; contributor Nick Levine believed it to be \"their most danceable album to date\". \"Tangled Up\" is the group's first record to not include &lt;a href=\"Cover%20version\"&gt;cover songs&lt;/a&gt; and traditional &lt;a href=\"Pop%20ballad\"&gt;ballads&lt;/a&gt;. Nadine Coyle said that the tracks from \"Tangled Up\" were \"all in the same vein,\" contrary to their previous releases, of which she described the song selection as \"quite random\". There are several themes discussed throughout the record, including melancholy, love, relationships, sex and femeninity. Girls Aloud co-wrote two of the twelve tracks on \"Tangled Up\": \"&lt;a href=\"Sexy%21%20No%20No%20No...\"&gt;Sexy! No No No...&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Crocodile Tears\". They also co-wrote and recorded a song titled \"Hoxton Heroes\", which pokes fun at &lt;a href=\"Independent%20music\"&gt;indie&lt;/a&gt; bands. The song was deemed too controversial for \"Tangled Up\" and therefore omitted from the album; however, the song was released as a B-Side to \"&lt;a href=\"Can%27t%20Speak%20French\"&gt;Can't Speak French&lt;/a&gt;\". Cheryl stated that whilst they never intended to enter the industry as \"brilliant lyricists\", they felt \"comfortable with writing bits and pieces\".\nSongs.\nThe album opens with \"&lt;a href=\"Call%20the%20Shots\"&gt;Call the Shots&lt;/a&gt;\", an \"elegant\" &lt;a href=\"electropop\"&gt;electropop&lt;/a&gt; ballad that incorporates elements of &lt;a href=\"1980s%20in%20music\"&gt;1980s&lt;/a&gt; pop and &lt;a href=\"1990s%20in%20music\"&gt;1990s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, and minor Europop sounds. Additionally, it was described as one of their softer\u2013sounding singles in their career and features a solo bridge section by member Nicola Roberts. Furthermore, Cheryl highlighted it as her favourite track from the album and believed it gives her \"goosebumps\". The second track, \"Close to Love\", was noted by commentators as the \"kick-starter\" to the album, singling out its \"energetic\" nature and dance\u2013house music as a factor. During the verses, it features a \"part &lt;a href=\"Rap%20%28music%29\"&gt;rap&lt;/a&gt;, part singing\" delivery by member Nadine Coyle. The third track of the album, \"&lt;a href=\"Sexy%21%20No%20No%20No...\"&gt;Sexy! No No No...&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014which was released as the record's lead single\u2014was described as one of their most \"daring\" single releases. Incorporating instrumentation such as &lt;a href=\"synthesizers\"&gt;synthesizers&lt;/a&gt;, keyboards and &lt;a href=\"vocoder\"&gt;vocoder&lt;/a&gt; pro-tools for Cheryl's vocals at the first part of the recording, it is an &lt;a href=\"Experimental%20music\"&gt;experimental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"power%20pop\"&gt;power pop&lt;/a&gt; anthem that emphasizes a &lt;a href=\"Rock%20music\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt;-like sound over-top accompanying &lt;a href=\"electronic%20music\"&gt;electronic music&lt;/a&gt;. \"Girl Overboard\" was singled out as one of the better cuts from the album, with many critics praising its \"clubby vibe\" and 80s-inspired house and &lt;a href=\"eurodance\"&gt;eurodance&lt;/a&gt; music. Moreover, a Matt O'Leary from &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Media\"&gt;Virgin Media&lt;/a&gt; felt the song was one of the only \"melodic\" mentions on \"Tangled Up\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Can%27t%20Speak%20French\"&gt;Can't Speak French&lt;/a&gt;\", the fifth song on the record, is a \"sultry\" midtempo number that features electric guitars and synths, similar to what was used during the phase of &lt;a href=\"smooth%20jazz\"&gt;smooth jazz&lt;/a&gt; music. Likewise, \"Black Jacks\" is another midtempo recording that boasts &lt;a href=\"1960s%20in%20music\"&gt;1960s&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"psychedelic%20music\"&gt;psychedelic music&lt;/a&gt;, and was compared to the work of &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Basil\"&gt;Toni Basil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sugababes\"&gt;Sugababes&lt;/a&gt;. Another melodic track to \"Tangled Up\", it was selected by some critics as one of the \"finest\" moments from both the album and Girls Aloud's career. The seventh track, \"Control of the Knife\", is a &lt;a href=\"Reggae%20music\"&gt;reggae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ska%20music\"&gt;ska&lt;/a&gt;-influenced tune that incorporates a variety of trumpets, drum machines and synthesizers. During the song's chorus, an uncredited male singer performs the lines \"Got sweet hassle, sweet talking me / Got cheap babble, cheap talking free,\" through vocoder effects. \"Fling\" was described by \"&lt;a href=\"DIY%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;DIY&lt;/a&gt;\"'s Stuart McCaighy as a \"trademark GA\" track, signifying its \"beefed-up dancefloor\" sound and rap section as examples. Similarly, Nick Levine at Digital Spy noticed that the track saw Girls Aloud on \"full vamp-mode\".\nThe ninth song is \"What You Crying For\", first described by Cheryl as a \"&lt;a href=\"UK%20garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt;-sound track\". However, critics refutted these comments by defining its sound as &lt;a href=\"drum%20and%20bass\"&gt;drum and bass&lt;/a&gt;, with influences of pop and &lt;a href=\"two-step%20garage\"&gt;two-step garage&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a negative remark by McCaighy, many other music editors highlighted the production as \"forward-thinking\" and believed the members \"excelled themselves\". The \"futuristic\" \"I'm Falling\" includes \"squelchy sounds with a punky guitar\", which was later compared to Girls Aloud's track \"&lt;a href=\"Graffiti%20My%20Soul\"&gt;Graffiti My Soul&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Music\"&gt;BBC Music&lt;/a&gt;'s Talia Kraines. \"Damn\" was one of the only tracks that was not frequently discussed by critics in their reviews for \"Tangled Up\", but the &lt;a href=\"pop%20rock\"&gt;pop rock&lt;/a&gt;-number was criticized for not sonically \"blending\" with the rest of the material. The album closer, \"Crocodile Tears\", is an &lt;a href=\"acoustic%20pop\"&gt;acoustic pop&lt;/a&gt; song that focuses more on the members' \"intelligent\" vocal performances, an element to which was never highlighted in their previous work, as mentioned by &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt;'s John Lucas.\nRelease and packaging.\n\"Tangled Up\" was first released in Ireland on 16 November 2007, and throughout Europe on 19 November 2007. It was distributed by &lt;a href=\"Fascination%20Records\"&gt;Fascination&lt;/a&gt; in two physical formats\u2014a standard &lt;a href=\"compact%20disc\"&gt;compact disc&lt;/a&gt; and a special &lt;a href=\"jewelcase\"&gt;jewelcase&lt;/a&gt; packaging\u2014 and available for &lt;a href=\"Music%20download\"&gt;digital consumption&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Polydor%20Records\"&gt;Polydor&lt;/a&gt;. The record was issued through the &lt;a href=\"iTunes%20Store\"&gt;iTunes Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Music\"&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/a&gt; worldwide the following year by Polydor, and on 7 October 2015, \"Tangled Up\", along with various other musical releases by Girls Aloud, were released in North America. The artwork has the group's name and the album title hung on several long black rods in front of a purple background; the lyrics for each song were not featured in the accompanying booklet. The title of the album, \"Tangled Up\", derives from a sentence of the album track \"Close to Love\". It is the only Girls Aloud album cover art not to feature the members; it received negative remarks from commentators for its \"boring\" context and imagery.\nA fan edition of \"Tangled Up\" was also available through Girls Aloud's official website; the artwork incorporates each of the members holding onto long thick metal wires covered in rubber, while the original photos were placed inside the booklet. Additionally, the CD came with the lyrics and signed postcards. Despite the change, which was positively received, the artwork was noted by critics for its slightly uneven display of member Nicola Roberts, whose photo occupies marginally less space than those of the remaining four members, as described by Fraser McAlphine of &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Music\"&gt;BBC Music&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Mixed Up\".\nIn addition to the album, Girls Aloud and Fascination teamed up with &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Gingell\"&gt;Julian Gingell&lt;/a&gt; and Barry Stone\u2014under the pseudonym Jewels &amp; Stone\u2014to produce a limited edition &lt;a href=\"remix%20album\"&gt;remix album&lt;/a&gt;. \"Mixed Up\", the group's first and only remix collection, was available to purchase only from British retail stores &lt;a href=\"Woolworths%20Group%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Woolworths&lt;/a&gt;, and was available at a discounted price when bought together with \"Tangled Up\". The artwork is similar to that of the parent album, but the Girls Aloud text is altered to have multi-colored font. Despite the collection featuring eight remixed tracks, \"Mixed Up\" only features one recording from \"Tangled Up\"; this was \"Sexy! No No No...\", which was edited and remixed by &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Lamezma\"&gt;Tony Lamezma&lt;/a&gt;, whilst the remaining content comes from the group's previous singles. For the deluxe editions of \"Tangled Up\" on iTunes, the remix album was condensed down into a 38-long minute track and included as the final appearing number; it was made for an \"album only\" purchase.\nSingles.\nThe first single from \"Tangled Up\" was \"&lt;a href=\"Sexy%21%20No%20No%20No...\"&gt;Sexy! No No No...&lt;/a&gt;\", which was released on 3 September 2007. A critical success, the single reached number five on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; and number 11 on both the \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" Euro Digital Songs Chart and &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;Irish Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. The accompanying music video was directed by &lt;a href=\"Trudy%20Bellinger\"&gt;Trudy Bellinger&lt;/a&gt;, and features the group sporting futuristic-looking skintight PVC catsuits with peep-toe high heels as they dance through wires stretched across the set. \"&lt;a href=\"Call%20the%20Shots\"&gt;Call the Shots&lt;/a&gt;\", the second single from the album, was released on 26 November. It achieved critical acclaim from critics, and was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Popjustice%20%C2%A320%20Music%20Prize\"&gt;Popjustice \u00a320 Music Prize&lt;/a&gt;, Girls Aloud's fourth win in that category. It was also a commercial success, peaking at number three in the UK, and number nine in Ireland. The accompanying music video was directed by Sean de Sparengo, and features the members in purple dresses performing on &lt;a href=\"Malibu%20Beach\"&gt;Malibu Beach&lt;/a&gt; at night with flames and white fabric surrounding them. Each member of the band is also shown in other locations, following several story lines. Although they were in discussion, \"Control of the Knife\" and \"Close to Love\" were scrapped from being the third single in favour of \"&lt;a href=\"Can%27t%20Speak%20French\"&gt;Can't Speak French&lt;/a&gt;\", which was released 17 March 2008; this was during the same time Girls Aloud were working on the material to \"&lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Control%20%28Girls%20Aloud%20album%29\"&gt;Out of Control&lt;/a&gt;\" (2008). Critically and commercially successful, a music video was shot by Petro that features Girls Aloud in elaborate costumes inspired by &lt;a href=\"Marie%20Antoinette\"&gt;Marie Antoinette&lt;/a&gt; and 18th century French fashions.\nCritical reception.\nUpon its release, \"Tangled Up\" received universal acclaim from music critics. In an article from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20List%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;The List&lt;/a&gt;\", Camilla Pia awarded the album a five-star rating, praising the mixture of genres, \"witty lyrics, insanely infectious melodies and soaring choruses that explode out of nowhere\". However, Pia noted Xenomania's \"genius\" production and concluded that \"Tangled Up\" \"is a standout example of some of the best British songwriting in years\". Talia Kraines of &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Music\"&gt;BBC Music&lt;/a&gt; agreed, labelling it another \"unrelenting pop masterpiece\" by the group, made \"without ever losing their sense of fun\", while complimenting the \"challenging\" production. &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; writer John Lucas awarded the album four stars, considering it a \"short, sharp and tight collection of some of the most exciting music in a particularly exciting career\". Lucas also commended the album's maturity and its heavy use of electropop music. Similarly, Matt O'Leary of &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Media\"&gt;Virgin Media&lt;/a&gt; rated \"Tangled Up\" four and a half stars out of five, describing the album as \"ballsy pop with moments of eclecticism which [\u2026] results in hair-curlingly exciting music\", and enjoyed the group's ability to grow creatively. James Cabooter from \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Star%20%28British%20newspaper%29\"&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/a&gt;\" listed it as their \"Album of the Week\".\nAlthough Alexis Petridis, a contributor to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", felt that the opening half of \"Tangled Up\" was \"disappointing\", he commended the melodies, songwriting and variety of music elements; for that, he awarded the record four stars. Nick Levine from &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Spy\"&gt;Digital Spy&lt;/a&gt; found the songs \"fun, frivolous, catchy, sexy and innovative\", and called it their most \"danceable album to date\". John Murphy of &lt;a href=\"MusicOMH\"&gt;MusicOMH&lt;/a&gt; examined how \"Tangled Up\" proved to show how Girls Aloud had managed to move on creatively since their time on reality TV, and commended the album's pop and electronic aspects. Although he called it \"original, inventive and sometimes exhilarating\", the only aspect of criticism was aimed towards the album cover. A reviewer for &lt;a href=\"NME\"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt; rated the album 7 out of 10, saying that the group's career \"has been marked by genre-hopping,\" and felt that \"Tangled Up\" \"will continue the trend\". The reviewer also highlighted the songs \"Fling\" and \"Can't Speak French\" as \"unbeatable future pop hits\". Although criticizing the choices of certain songs and member Nadine Coyle's overemphasized vocal deliveries, Stuart McCaighy from \"&lt;a href=\"DIY%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;DIY&lt;/a&gt;\" awarded it 8 points and commended the production and quality of songs.\nConversely, \"Tangled Up\" received mixed opinions by commentators who felt divided by the content and production. Nick Butler from &lt;a href=\"Sputnikmusic\"&gt;Sputnikmusic&lt;/a&gt; gave it two and a half points out of five, labelling it \"average\". Butler criticized Xenomania's input for making the record sound inconsistent and \"wild\", whilst also noting that the production overlapped the girl group. Citing the album track \"What You Waiting For\" as the album's only \"tuneful thing here\", he went on to conclude it as \"Girls Aloud's worst album yet\". \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times\"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;\" writer Steve Jelbert awarded the album three stars and gave it a mixed review, calling it as \"predictable as a motorway, but fun\". Similarly, Dom Passantino at &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20in%20Sound\"&gt;Drowned in Sound&lt;/a&gt; awarded it four points out of ten, highlighting the lack of originality and \"stupid\" themes as core reasons for the rating. He also criticized the \"boring\" vocal performances, but only recommended \"Black Jacks\" for its \"acceptable\" quality.\nCommercial performance.\nCommercially, \"Tangled Up\" experienced success in the United Kingdom. The record debut at number four and five on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Albums%20Chart\"&gt;UK Albums Chart&lt;/a&gt; and the physical component chart, making it the group's first studio album to enter the top ten since \"&lt;a href=\"What%20Will%20the%20Neighbours%20Say%3F\"&gt;What Will the Neighbours Say?&lt;/a&gt;\" (2004) and their highest record since &lt;a href=\"Sound%20of%20the%20Underground%20%28album%29\"&gt;their debut&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. That same week\u2014dated 25 November 2007\u2014it managed to peak one position higher on the downloads chart, their highest peak since its establishment. \"Tangled Up\" appeared only once inside the top ten of the album chart, descending to number 12 the following week. The record stayed inside the top 40 for another 17 weeks, tallying it up to 36 appearances. After the release of Girls Aloud's fifth and final studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Control%20%28Girls%20Aloud%20album%29\"&gt;Out of Control&lt;/a&gt;\" (2008), \"Tangled Up\" re-entered the top 100 chart at number 79, and spent eight weeks outside the top 70. Then in November 2008, the album re-charted at number 53 while \"Out of Control\" was still inside the top 100, and charted for a total of three weeks.\nTo date, \"Tangled Up\" has spent 47 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, making it their longest-charting studio album. It was certified Platinum by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Phonographic%20Industry\"&gt;British Phonographic Industry&lt;/a&gt; (BPI) for shipments of 300,000 units, and has sold 505,000 copies as of March 2013. In Ireland, \"Tangled Up\" experienced moderate success and entered at number 25, their second record after \"&lt;a href=\"Chemistry%20%28Girls%20Aloud%20album%29\"&gt;Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;\" (2005) not to enter the top 20. It dropped to number 33 in the following chart, but spent another ten weeks steadily inside the top 60. Nevertheless, \"Tangled Up\" was certified Gold by the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Recorded%20Music%20Association\"&gt;Irish Recorded Music Association&lt;/a&gt; (IRMA) for shipments of 7,500 units. The album entered at number four on the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Albums%20Chart\"&gt;Scottish Albums Chart&lt;/a&gt;, and experienced a similar run as on the UK Albums Chart.\nPromotion.\nCommercial and televised appearances.\nIn order to promote \"Tangled Up\", Girls Aloud conducted a series of promotional activities such as television, commercial and magazine appearances. One of the earlier promotion schedules was an appearance by Nadine Coyle on &lt;a href=\"RT%C3%89%20One\"&gt;RT\u00c9 One&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20with%20Miriam\"&gt;Saturday Night with Miriam&lt;/a&gt;\" on 14 July 2007, where she briefly commented on the work of \"Tangled Up\" and \"Sexy! No No No...\". Subsequently, the group began promotion of the album by performing the single at the &lt;a href=\"T4%20on%20the%20Beach\"&gt;T4 on the Beach&lt;/a&gt; special on 22 July 2007, and sang the track on further TV show specials. In November that year, the band performed their single \"Call the Shots\" on various charity and television shows, such as &lt;a href=\"UNICEF\"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%20series%204%29\"&gt;The X Factor&lt;/a&gt;\", and performed a Christmas special for \"&lt;a href=\"Top%20of%20the%20Pops\"&gt;Top of the Pops&lt;/a&gt;\" in December.

Similarly, an editor at \"Metro\" valued both singles as some of their most \"daring\" and \"critically acclaimed\" singles, and some of the \"best work in the 21st century\". \"Call the Shots\", in particular, has been cited as one of the greatest songs in &lt;a href=\"Pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; history, as claimed by publications such as &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Popjustice\"&gt;Popjustice&lt;/a&gt;, amongst others; furthermore, the single won the &lt;a href=\"Popjustice%20%C2%A320%20Music%20Prize\"&gt;Popjustice \u00a320 Music Prize&lt;/a&gt;, Girls Aloud's fourth consecutive win in that category, of eight nominations in total.
