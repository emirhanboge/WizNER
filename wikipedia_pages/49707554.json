    "text": "Rear Admiral Francis D. \"Bill\" Moran (born 8 April 1935) is a retired career officer who served in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps, its successor, the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps), and the ESSA Corps's successor, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration%20Commissioned%20Officer%20Corps\"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA Corps). He served as the third Director of the NOAA Corps.\nDuring his career, Moran created and led two new &lt;a href=\"National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration\"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA) aviation units, and also established the first &lt;a href=\"Fishery\"&gt;fisheries&lt;/a&gt; program for NOAA personnel.\nEarly life.\nMoran was born in &lt;a href=\"Biloxi%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Biloxi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, on 8 April 1935. He graduated from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20Mississippi\"&gt;University of Southern Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; in 1960 with a &lt;a href=\"bachelor%20of%20science\"&gt;bachelor of science&lt;/a&gt; degree in &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"geology\"&gt;geology&lt;/a&gt;. After graduating, he was awarded an assistantship at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Tennessee\"&gt;University of Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nIn 1961, Moran joined the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20and%20Geodetic%20Survey\"&gt;United States Coast and Geodetic Survey&lt;/a&gt;, accepting a &lt;a href=\"Commissioned%20officer\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"Ensign%20%28rank%29\"&gt;ensign&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20and%20Geodetic%20Survey%20Corps\"&gt;United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps&lt;/a&gt;. In the following years, he served on five &lt;a href=\"survey%20ship\"&gt;survey ship&lt;/a&gt;s of the Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet.\nOn 13 July 1965, a new &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Government\"&gt;United States Government&lt;/a&gt; scientific agency, the &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Science%20Services%20Administration\"&gt;Environmental Science Services Administration&lt;/a&gt; (ESSA), was created. Under the reorganization that created ESSA, both the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Weather%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Weather Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, although retaining their independent identities, came under the control of ESSA, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps was removed from the Coast and Geodetic Survey and subordinated directly to ESSA, becoming the &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Science%20Services%20Administration%20Corps\"&gt;Environmental Science Services Administration Corps&lt;/a&gt; (ESSA Corps). As of that date, Moran became an officer of the new ESSA Corps. On 3 October 1970, ESSA was abolished and replaced by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration\"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA). Under the reorganization that accompanied the creation of NOAA, the Coast and Geodetic Survey was abolished and its functions were transferred to various parts of the new NOAA organization. The ESSA Corps became the new &lt;a href=\"National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration%20Commissioned%20Officer%20Corps\"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA Corps), and Moran became a NOAA Corps officer.\nMoran served as chief of NOAA's Pacific Tides Party and as NOAA liaison to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; from 1970 to 1973. In 1974, he attended the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;University of Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; full-time, graduating that year with a &lt;a href=\"master%27s%20degree\"&gt;master's degree&lt;/a&gt; in marine affairs; during his time at the university, he established and attended the first &lt;a href=\"Fishery\"&gt;fisheries&lt;/a&gt; program for NOAA personnel. From 1975 to 1981, he was assigned to the NOAA Research Facilities Center, where he established and served as chief of the Helicopter Operations Group, which supported the Outer &lt;a href=\"Continental%20Shelf\"&gt;Continental Shelf&lt;/a&gt; Energy Assessment Program. From 1982 to 1983, Moran was the executive assistant in the Office of the Deputy Administrator of NOAA. From 1983 to 1986, he was the first director of NOAA's new Office of Aircraft Operations, bringing together five semi-autonomous NOAA aviation units to create the new office, and by the end of that tour was a &lt;a href=\"Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;rear admiral&lt;/a&gt; who had amassed over 6,000 hours in flight time and was the only NOAA Corps officer qualified in every type of helicopter and &lt;a href=\"fixed-wing%20aircraft\"&gt;fixed-wing aircraft&lt;/a&gt; in the NOAA inventory.\nOn 17 June 1986, &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Reagan\"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; nominated Moran to succeed Rear Admiral &lt;a href=\"Kelly%20E.%20Taggart\"&gt;Kelly E. Taggart&lt;/a&gt; as Director of the NOAA Corps. Confirmed by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; that year, he served as director until his retirement in 1990.\nPersonal life.\nMoran and his wife have two children.\nAwards.\n &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Commerce%20Silver%20Medal\"&gt;Department of Commerce Silver Medal&lt;/a&gt;\nIn a ceremony on 20 November 1986 in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, Moran received the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Commerce%20Silver%20Medal\"&gt;Department of Commerce Silver Medal&lt;/a&gt; for his work during his 1983-1986 tour as director of the new Office of Aviation Operations."
