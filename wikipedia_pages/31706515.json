These designs espouse the belief in enriching spaces through combining seemingly disparate elements, whether they pertain to the narrative sequences contained within a building, &lt;a href=\"geometry\"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Materiality%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;materiality&lt;/a&gt;."
