    "text": "August Emil Fieldorf (\"&lt;a href=\"nom%20de%20guerre\"&gt;nom de guerre&lt;/a&gt;\"; \u201c\"Nil\"\u201d; 20 March 1895 \u2013 24 February 1953) was a Polish &lt;a href=\"brigadier%20general\"&gt;brigadier general&lt;/a&gt; who served as deputy commander-in-chief of the &lt;a href=\"Home%20Army\"&gt;Home Army&lt;/a&gt; after the suppression of the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Uprising\"&gt;Warsaw Uprising&lt;/a&gt; (August 1944 \u2013 October 1944).\nIn 1953 he was executed by the communist regime.\nBiography.\nGeneral Fieldorf's ancestors were partly of &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; origin. He was born on 20 March 1895 in &lt;a href=\"Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;. There he finished men's college of St Nicholas and later a &lt;a href=\"seminary\"&gt;seminary&lt;/a&gt;. In 1910 he joined the Polish pro-independence paramilitary organization &lt;a href=\"Riflemen%27s%20Association\"&gt;Riflemen's Association&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a full member in 1912. He also finished the school for &lt;a href=\"non-commissioned%20officer\"&gt;non-commissioned officer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWorld War I.\nOn 6 August 1914, Fieldorf volunteered for the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Legions%20in%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;1st Brigade of the Legions&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zef%20Pi%C5%82sudski\"&gt;J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski&lt;/a&gt;. With them he set out for the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Russian Front&lt;/a&gt;, where he served in the position of second-in-command of an &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"platoon\"&gt;platoon&lt;/a&gt;. In 1916 he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"sergeant\"&gt;sergeant&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1917 directed to officer school.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"oath%20crisis\"&gt;oath crisis&lt;/a&gt; he was pressed into the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Army\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Army&lt;/a&gt; and moved to the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Italian front&lt;/a&gt;, which he abandoned to return to Poland. In August 1918 he volunteered at the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Military%20Organisation\"&gt;Polish Military Organisation&lt;/a&gt; in his home city of Krak\u00f3w.\nFormation of a new Polish state.\nFrom November 1918 Fieldorf served in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Army\"&gt;Polish Army&lt;/a&gt; in the newly forming &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Second%20Republic\"&gt;Second Republic&lt;/a&gt;, initially as a platoon commander, and from March 1919 commanded a &lt;a href=\"heavy%20machine%20gun\"&gt;heavy machine gun&lt;/a&gt; company. In 1919 and 1920 he took part in the campaign to join the &lt;a href=\"Vilnius\"&gt;Wilno&lt;/a&gt; region to Poland proper. After the commencement of the &lt;a href=\"Polish-Bolshevik%20War\"&gt;Polish-Bolshevik War&lt;/a&gt;, as a company commander he participated in liberating &lt;a href=\"Daugavpils\"&gt;Dyneburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zhytomyr\"&gt;\u017bytomierz&lt;/a&gt; and in the 1920 &lt;a href=\"Kiev%20Offensive%20%281920%29\"&gt;Polish Expedition to Kiev&lt;/a&gt;.\nFieldorf married Janina Kobylinska in 1919, with whom he had two daughters, Krystyna and Maria. Remaining on active duty after World War I, he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; and posted to the 1st Polish Infantry Regiment, as a &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt; commander. In 1935 he was given command of the \"&lt;a href=\"Trakai\"&gt;Troki&lt;/a&gt;\" independent battalion of the &lt;a href=\"Border%20Protection%20Corps%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Border Protection Corps&lt;/a&gt;. A year later, he became a &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20colonel\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, he was made commander of the 51st &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Garibaldi\"&gt;Giuseppe Garibaldi&lt;/a&gt; Rifle Regiment within the &lt;a href=\"12th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;12th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern fringes of Poland (&lt;a href=\"Kresy%20Wschodnie\"&gt;Kresy Wschodnie&lt;/a&gt;).\nWorld War II.\nFieldorf commanded his regiment during the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20September%20Campaign\"&gt;Polish September Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. After the Division's defeat, on the night of September 8\u20139, he fled in civilian clothes to his native Krak\u00f3w. From there he attempted to get to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, but was stopped on the &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt; border. He was interned in October 1939, but fled several weeks later from a &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; and reached France via &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, where he joined the newly-forming &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Polish Armed Forces in the West&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn France he completed staff courses and was promoted to full &lt;a href=\"colonel\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt; in May 1940. In September of that year, he was smuggled back to &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;occupied Poland&lt;/a&gt; as the first emissary of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20government-in-exile\"&gt;Polish government-in-exile&lt;/a&gt;, under the \"&lt;a href=\"pseudonym\"&gt;nom de guerre&lt;/a&gt;\" \"Nil\" which he had chosen for himself. His circuitous route back to Poland took him through South Africa, and by air, over Rhodesia, Sudan, and Egypt, then on to Romania, and by train to Poland. His aeroplane's flight-path over Sudan and Egypt followed the Nile, hence his nom de guerre, \"Nil\" (Nile in Polish). He initially joined the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Armed%20Struggle\"&gt;Union of Armed Struggle&lt;/a&gt; in Warsaw and from 1941 in Wilno and in &lt;a href=\"Bia%C5%82ystok\"&gt;Bia\u0142ystok&lt;/a&gt;. A year later he was given command of the &lt;a href=\"Kedyw\"&gt;Kedyw&lt;/a&gt; (special operations executive) of the AK, where he served until February 1944. It was on his order that the infamous &lt;a href=\"SS%20and%20Police%20Leader\"&gt;SS and Police Leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Kutschera\"&gt;Franz Kutschera&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated on 1 February 1944 in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Kutschera\"&gt;Operation Kutschera&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Szare%20Szeregi\"&gt;Szare Szeregi&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Uprising\"&gt;Warsaw Uprising&lt;/a&gt; on 28 September 1944 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general with an order from the Supreme Commander &lt;a href=\"Kazimierz%20Sosnkowski\"&gt;Kazimierz Sosnkowski&lt;/a&gt;. He became the deputy commander-in-chief of the AK under General &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20Okulicki\"&gt;Leopold Okulicki&lt;/a&gt; in October 1944. He was also nominated for future command of the &lt;a href=\"NIE%20%28resistance%29\"&gt;NIE Organisation&lt;/a&gt;, which was formed from the cadre of the AK with the intention of resisting the new Polish &lt;a href=\"Stalinism\"&gt;Stalinist&lt;/a&gt; government.\nArrests and execution.\nOn 7 March 1945, Fieldorf was arrested by the Soviet &lt;a href=\"NKVD\"&gt;NKVD&lt;/a&gt; in the town of &lt;a href=\"Milan%C3%B3wek\"&gt;Milan\u00f3wek&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, he was misidentified under the name Walenty Gdanicki and sent to a &lt;a href=\"Gulag\"&gt;forced labour camp&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20Mountains\"&gt;Ural Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Released in 1947, he returned to new Poland ruled by the communist &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Polish Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; government and the increasingly repressive &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Ministry of Public Security&lt;/a&gt;. He settled in &lt;a href=\"Bia%C5%82a%20Podlaska\"&gt;Bia\u0142a Podlaska&lt;/a&gt; under his assumed name and did not return to underground activities. Moving between Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w, he eventually settled in &lt;a href=\"%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;\u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe government, which was persecuting former resistance members loyal to the &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;-based government-in-exile, offered an &lt;a href=\"amnesty\"&gt;amnesty&lt;/a&gt; to them, in 1948. Not knowing that the amnesty was a sham, Fieldorf outed himself to the authorities. He was then placed under investigatory arrest in Warsaw. In prison he refused to collaborate with the Communist security services, even under torture. General Fieldorf's brutal interrogations were personally supervised by &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20of%20Poland\"&gt;MBP&lt;/a&gt; colonel &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zef%20R%C3%B3%C5%BCa%C5%84ski\"&gt;J\u00f3zef R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;. Kazimierz Gorski, Polish secret police, the &lt;a href=\"Urz%C4%85d%20Bezpiecze%C5%84stwa\"&gt;UB&lt;/a&gt; interrogator, testified in 1997: \"\"[J\u00f3zef] R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski would stop by frequently during many of my interrogations of general [August] Fieldorf, and he would have conversations with him on many subjects. The prosecuting attorney Benjamin Wajsblech would show up frequently as well, and would, on many occasions, give me verbal instructions. I prepared a decision to refuse the general's [defense] evidence materials. I wrote it under the dictation of Wajsblech. I didn't decide as to whom, and how, I should interrogate\".\"\nFieldorf was accused by prosecutor &lt;a href=\"Helena%20Woli%C5%84ska-Brus\"&gt;Helena Woli\u0144ska-Brus&lt;/a&gt; of being a \"fascist-Hitlerite criminal\" and having ordered an execution of &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20partisans\"&gt;Soviet partisans&lt;/a&gt; while serving in the AK. After a &lt;a href=\"kangaroo%20court\"&gt;kangaroo court&lt;/a&gt; trial, he was sentenced to death on 16 April 1952 by the presiding judge &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Gurowska\"&gt;Maria Gurowska&lt;/a&gt;. An appeal to a higher court failed, and the family's plea for a pardon was denied by then the communist leader &lt;a href=\"Boles%C5%82aw%20Bierut\"&gt;Boles\u0142aw Bierut&lt;/a&gt; who refused to grant &lt;a href=\"clemency\"&gt;clemency&lt;/a&gt;. The sentence was carried out, by hanging, on 24 February 1953 at 3:00 pm in the infamous &lt;a href=\"Mokot%C3%B3w%20Prison\"&gt;Mokot\u00f3w Prison&lt;/a&gt; in Warsaw.\nThe Communist Prosecuting Attorney Wiktor Gattner described General Fieldorf's last moments as follows:\nI asked the condemned if he had any wishes. Fieldorf responded: 'Please notify my family'. I stated that his family would be notified [...] The condemned persistently looked straight into my eyes. He stood erect. No one was holding him. He made an appearance of a very strong man. One would almost admire his composure amidst such dramatic events. He neither screamed, nor made any gestures. I said: Carry out [the execution]! The executioner and one of the guards approached the condemned [\u2026] I went to see the warden afterwards, and then by my own hand I prepared the protocol of the execution.\nGeneral Fieldorf's body was never returned to his family, and remains buried in an unknown location to this day. In 2009, an article in a British newspaper suggested that Fieldorf was buried in a mass grave in a Warsaw cemetery, together with the remains of 248 other murdered Polish non-communists. \nIn 1958 the prosecutor's office discontinued any further investigations.\nCommemorating and recognition.\nIn 1972 a statue was erected on his &lt;a href=\"Cenotaph\"&gt;symbolic grave&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1989, following the collapse of &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Communist Poland&lt;/a&gt;, Fieldorf was officially rehabilitated.\nIn 2006 President &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Kaczy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Lech Kaczy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt; posthumously awarded him the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20White%20Eagle%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Order of the White Eagle&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012 the supposed mass grave site was to be searched for Fieldorf's remains.\nSearch for justice.\nFieldorf's daughter, Maria Fieldorf Czarska, called for the prosecutor responsible for the execution of her father, Helena Woli\u0144ska-Brus (who lived in &lt;a href=\"Oxford\"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, England until her death in 2008), to be brought to face justice in Poland. Woli\u0144ska, a military prosecutor in the 1950s, was accused of aiding in the investigation and trial that resulted in Fieldorf's execution. Woli\u0144ska signed Fieldorf's arrest warrant and extended his detention several times, although she was aware of his innocence. A 1956 report issued by the communist authorities concluded that Woli\u0144ska had violated the rule of law and was involved in mock investigations and show trials that frequently resulted in executions. The charges against her were initiated by the &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20National%20Remembrance\"&gt;Institute of National Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;, which claimed that Woli\u0144ska was an \"accessory to a court murder\", which is classified as a Stalinist crime, and is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The case attracted international attention. The United Kingdom refused to extradite her, and Woli\u0144ska-Brus died on 26 November 2008 without being brought to justice.\nSpeaking about other individuals who have had complicity in the court-sanctioned murder (that is of fabricated evidence) of her father, Maria Fieldorf-Czarska said:\n\"I can neither allow the investigation [into the murder] of my father to be closed, nor to allow the following individuals to escape justice: the Deputy Director of Justice at the General Prosecutors' Office, Alicja Graff, the Prosecuting Attorney, Wiktor Gattner, and the Interrogator, Kazimierz Gorski. They could have refused [to take part in my father's murder]. No one forced them either physically or psychologically [to do it]. I demand that the people who murdered my father be brought to justice [...] I dream of Poland, whose institutions of justice are transparent and worthy of true respect and confidence. These types of institutions ought to be the foundation of a sovereign nation. I would want us, Poles, so much, to be able to choose our own examples to follow, and not those promoted by others.\"\nFeature film.\nIn (2009) a historical drama movie entitled \"&lt;a href=\"Genera%C5%82%20Nil\"&gt;Genera\u0142 Nil&lt;/a&gt;\" based on Fieldorf's life premiered in Poland to generally positive reviews. It was directed by &lt;a href=\"Ryszard%20Bugajski\"&gt;Ryszard Bugajski&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Olgierd%20%C5%81ukaszewicz\"&gt;Olgierd \u0141ukaszewicz&lt;/a&gt; in the title role."
