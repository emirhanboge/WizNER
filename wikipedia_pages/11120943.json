Parental involvement in the youngsters' education is encouraged through the Menard Parent Teacher Club.\nHistory.\nHoly Savior Menard's roots date back to 1884, when Father L. Menard became the eleventh pastor\nof St. Francis Xavier Commercial College Catholic Church. On October 10, 1892, the works and\nprayers of Father Menard became a reality with the construction of the first school for boys in\nAlexandria. It was located on Second and Ogden Streets and was named the St. Francis Xavier\nCommercial College. In 1903, the school was rebuilt on the corner of Fourth and Beauregard\nStreets, next to the present St. Francis Xavier Cathedral. In 1915, the school was raised ten feet to\nprovide a third floor and additional floor space to handle the increased enrollment.\nFather Menard was also responsible for bringing the Sisters of Divine Providence and the\nBrothers of the Sacred Heart to Alexandria. The sisters taught at the St. Francis Xavier Girls\nAcademy, founded in 1894, and later at Providence Academy, Providence Central, and currently\nat Our Lady of Prompt Succor Elementary School. The Brothers taught at the Commercial\nCollege and later at Menard Memorial High School.\nIn June 1922, the Elliot Street property between 19th and 20th Streets was acquired, and after\nthirty-one years, the St. Francis Xavier Commercial College ceased to exist, being renamed\nMenard Memorial, after Father Menard. Menard Memorial operated at the Elliot Street location\nas a school for boys until 1966.\nIn 1914, St. Francis Xavier transformed into Providence Academy for Girls and opened on the\ngrounds of the present day Our Lady of Prompt Succor Church. In 1949, Providence Academy\nbecame Providence Central for girls in grades nine to twelve, and Our Lady of Prompt Succor\nfor boys and girls in kindergarten to eighth grade.\nIn 1934, the Menard Memorial school colors were changed from purple and gold to green, gold,\nand white, and the mascot was changed from the bulldogs to the eagles.\nThe year 1966 marked the last year for the name \"Menard Memorial.\" In that year, the school\ncombined with Providence Central to become Holy Savior Menard Central High School. The\nnew facility at its present location on Coliseum Boulevard opened in the fall of 1967.\nIn 1988, in cooperation with Our Lady of Prompt Succor, the seventh and eighth grades were\nmoved from Prompt Succor to Menard.\nHoly Savior Menard is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and by\nthe Louisiana State Department of Education. The School is affiliated with the National Catholic\nEducational Association, The National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the\nAssociation for Supervision and Curriculum Development. Athletic teams participate under the\nauspices of the Louisiana High School Athletic Association.\nHoly Savior Menard has graduated more than six thousand students. One of the school's greatest\nassets is the achievements of its graduates. Many prominent leaders in the Central Louisiana area\nare among students nurtured through their crucial adolescent years by the Brothers of the Sacred\nHeart, the Sisters of Divine Providence, and the dedicated lay faculty and staff members at Holy\nSavior Menard Central High School."
