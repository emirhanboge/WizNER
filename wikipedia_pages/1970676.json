    "text": "Crax is a &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"curassow\"&gt;curassow&lt;/a&gt;s in the order &lt;a href=\"Galliformes\"&gt;Galliformes&lt;/a&gt;, a clade of large, heavy-bodied, ground-feeding birds. They are known from tropical South America with one species, the &lt;a href=\"great%20curassow\"&gt;great curassow&lt;/a&gt;, ranging northwards through &lt;a href=\"Central%20America\"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt; as far as &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The curassows in this genus are noted for their &lt;a href=\"sexual%20dimorphism\"&gt;sexual dimorphism&lt;/a&gt;; males are more boldly coloured than females and have facial ornamentation such as knobs and wattles. They are also characterised by curly crests and contrastingly-coloured crissums (the area around the &lt;a href=\"cloaca\"&gt;cloaca&lt;/a&gt;). \"Crax\" curassows probably originated as a distinct lineage during the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Miocene\"&gt;Late Miocene&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Messinian\"&gt;Messinian&lt;/a&gt;, the ancestral Crax split into two lineages separated by the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Andes\"&gt;Colombian Andes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cordillera%20de%20M%C3%A9rida\"&gt;Cordillera de M\u00e9rida&lt;/a&gt; which uplifted at that time. The northern lineage radiated into the great, blue-billed, and yellow-knobbed curassows, while the four southern species evolved as they became separated by the uplifting of various mountain ranges.\nCharacteristics.\nThe variety of male bill ornament shapes and colors is typical for this genus, as is a curly crest and a contrasting white or rufous crissum. \"Crax\" species, even distantly related, readily &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28biology%29\"&gt;hybridize&lt;/a&gt;, with fertile offspring theoretically possible in all possible mating combinations\nTaxonomy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; \"Crax\" was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Carl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae\"&gt;tenth edition&lt;/a&gt; of his \"&lt;a href=\"Systema%20Naturae\"&gt;Systema Naturae&lt;/a&gt;\". The genus name may be based on the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; \n\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, \"kras\" meaning \"head\". The &lt;a href=\"type%20species\"&gt;type species&lt;/a&gt; was designated as the &lt;a href=\"great%20curassow\"&gt;great curassow&lt;/a&gt; (\"Crax rubra\") in 1897 by the American ornithologist &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Ridgway\"&gt;Robert Ridgway&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecies.\nThe genus contains 7 species:\nThis genus forms one of the two major lineages of curassows. It is distinguishable from its relatives by its pronounced &lt;a href=\"sexual%20dimorphism\"&gt;sexual dimorphism&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of the black curassow). In other genera sexual dimorphism is rarely exhibited or of minor appearance (\"&lt;a href=\"Nothocrax\"&gt;Nothocrax&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Pauxi\"&gt;Pauxi&lt;/a&gt;\"), or manifest by size only (\"&lt;a href=\"Mitu%20%28bird%29\"&gt;Mitu&lt;/a&gt;\").\nEvolution.\n\"Crax\" curassows probably originated as a distinct lineage during the &lt;a href=\"Tortonian\"&gt;Tortonian&lt;/a&gt; (Late &lt;a href=\"Miocene\"&gt;Miocene&lt;/a&gt;), some 10-9 &lt;a href=\"mya%20%28unit%29\"&gt;mya&lt;/a&gt;, in the western or northwestern &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Basin\"&gt;Amazonas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Depression%20%28geology%29\"&gt;basin&lt;/a&gt;, as indicated by &lt;a href=\"mtDNA\"&gt;mt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nDNA\"&gt;nDNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"DNA%20sequence\"&gt;sequence&lt;/a&gt; data calibrated against &lt;a href=\"geological\"&gt;geological&lt;/a&gt; events (Pereira &amp; Baker 2004, Pereira \"et al.\" 2002). Some 6 mya during the &lt;a href=\"Messinian\"&gt;Messinian&lt;/a&gt;, the ancestral \"Crax\" split into two lineages which are separated by the &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Andes\"&gt;Andes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cordillera%20de%20M%C3%A9rida\"&gt;Cordillera de M\u00e9rida&lt;/a&gt; which were uplifted around that time, and the &lt;a href=\"Orinoco\"&gt;Orinoco&lt;/a&gt; which consequently assumed its present-day basin.\nThe northern lineage quite soon thereafter radiated into the ancestors of the great, blue-billed, and yellow-knobbed curassows, which were isolated from each other by the uplift of the northern &lt;a href=\"Cordillera%20Occidental%2C%20Colombia\"&gt;Cordillera Occidental&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Serran%C3%ADa%20del%20Perij%C3%A1\"&gt;Serran\u00eda del Perij\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, respectively; it is fairly certain that these lineages were well distinct by the end of the &lt;a href=\"Miocene\"&gt;Miocene&lt;/a&gt;. (Pereira &amp; Baker 2004)\nThe evolution of the 4 southern species was somewhat more complex. In the Messinian, about 6\u20135.5 mya, the ancestors of the wattled curassow became isolated in the western Amazonas basin. With increasing &lt;a href=\"arid\"&gt;arid&lt;/a&gt;ification of southeastern Brazil, the ancestors of the red-billed curassow found refuge in the mountain ranges between the &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Highlands\"&gt;Brazilian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and the Atlantic during the mid-&lt;a href=\"Zanclean\"&gt;Zanclean&lt;/a&gt;, some 4.5-4 mya. The divergence between the bare-faced and black curassow lineages apparently took place around the &lt;a href=\"Uquian\"&gt;Uquian&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Ensenadan\"&gt;Ensenadan&lt;/a&gt; boundary, some 1.5 mya. This which coincides with one or several period(s) of elevated &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;s during which the lower Amazonas basin was a brackish lagoon which offered little curassow habitat. Their present ranges are consequently still separated by the Amazonas river. (Pereira &amp; Baker 2004)"
