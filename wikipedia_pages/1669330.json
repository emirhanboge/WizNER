    "text": "Caltha is a &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"rhizome\"&gt;rhizomatous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ranunculaceae\"&gt;Ranunculaceae&lt;/a&gt; (\"buttercup family\"), to which ten species have been assigned. They occur in moist environments in &lt;a href=\"temperateness\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; and cold regions of both the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Hemisphere\"&gt;Northern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Hemisphere\"&gt;Southern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;s. Their &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are generally heart-shaped or kidney-shaped, or are characteristically diplophyllous (the auricles of the leaf blades form distinctly inflexed appendages). Flowers are &lt;a href=\"Floral%20symmetry%23Actinomorphic\"&gt;star shaped&lt;/a&gt; and mostly yellow to white. True &lt;a href=\"petal\"&gt;petal&lt;/a&gt;s and nectaries are missing but the five or more &lt;a href=\"sepal\"&gt;sepal&lt;/a&gt;s are distinctly colored. As usual in the buttercup family there is a circle of &lt;a href=\"stamen\"&gt;stamen&lt;/a&gt;s around (two to twenty-five) free &lt;a href=\"carpel\"&gt;carpel&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDescription.\n\"Caltha\" species are hairless, dwarf to medium size (1\u201380\u00a0cm high) &lt;a href=\"perennial\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s, with &lt;a href=\"Leaf%23Arrangement%20on%20the%20stem\"&gt;alternate&lt;/a&gt; leaves. These leaves are &lt;a href=\"Leaf%23Divisions%20of%20the%20blade\"&gt;simple&lt;/a&gt; (in all Northern Hemisphere species), or have one pair of lobes at the base (in \"C. sagittata\") which is mostly oriented at a straight angle to the larger top lobe but is sometimes in the same plane (in some of its northern populations), or the basal lobes are merged with the top lobe to form two (occasionally three) appendages (in all remaining species) which are attached next to the midvein, with the &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23A\"&gt;adaxial&lt;/a&gt; surfaces of top lobe and appendages facing each other. This condition of the Southern Hemisphere species is referred to as diplophylly. All species have stalked basal leaves, and some also have one or few leaves on the &lt;a href=\"Peduncle%20%28botany%29\"&gt;flowerstalk&lt;/a&gt;. The flowers are single on a short stalk in the middle of the rosette of basal leaves (Southern Hemisphere species) or in a mostly few-flowered &lt;a href=\"corymb\"&gt;corymb&lt;/a&gt;, without or with one or few mostly sessile leaflike &lt;a href=\"stipule\"&gt;stipule&lt;/a&gt;s. Northern Hemisphere species have kidney to (elongated) hart-shaped leaves and stipules, with simple toothed or scalloped margins. Southern Hemisphere species between them show a variety in leafshapes. In \"C.\u00a0appendiculata\" the top lobe is regularly more or less &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23T\"&gt;trifid&lt;/a&gt;, with an indent at the tip of each segment, but it is also often spoon-shaped with an entire margin with a more or less &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/retuse\"&gt;retuse&lt;/a&gt; tip. The top lobe in \"C.\u00a0dionaeifolia\" is split into ovate left and right halves, which are distinctly folded towards each other (plicate), and have a concave upper surface, an entire margin with toothlike hairs regularly spaced around its margins while the appendages are similar in shape but \u00bd\u2013\u2154\u00d7 as large. \"C.\u00a0sagittata\" has wide arrowhead-shaped leaves with an entire margin and appendages triangular and about \u2154\u00d7 as large, \"C.\u00a0intriloba\" has narrow arrowhead-shaped to elongate ovate leaves with a slightly scalopped margin, with lanceolate-triangular appendages \u2154\u00d7 as long. \"C.\u00a0novae-zelandiae\" has spade-shaped leaves a bit longer than wide with a round and slightly retuse top and a slightly scalopped margin with appendages half as long, triangular with a blunt tip. Finally \"C.\u00a0obtusa\" also has spade-shaped leaves, with a round and slightly retuse top, but these are about as wide as long and are distinctly scalloped particularly towards the base, and appendages about \u00be\u00d7 as long with a likewise scalloped outer margin and a straight entire inner margin. The actinomorphic flowers lack true &lt;a href=\"petal\"&gt;petal&lt;/a&gt;s and nectaries, but the five to nine (sometimes as little as four or as much as thirteen) &lt;a href=\"sepal\"&gt;sepal&lt;/a&gt;s are distinctly colored yellow (rarely orange or red) to white (sometimes tinged pink or magenta). The shape of the sepals varies between broadly ovate, obtuse, oblong to lanceolate. The number of stamens range between 6\u20139 in the smallest species (\"C.\u00a0dionaeifolia\") and 60-120 in the largest (\"C.\u00a0palustris\") and likewise does the number of carpels range between 2-5 and 5-25. Stamens encircle the carpels and both are planted on a flat &lt;a href=\"Receptacle%20%28botany%29\"&gt;floral base&lt;/a&gt;. The pollen is yellow and &lt;a href=\"tricolpate\"&gt;tricolpate&lt;/a&gt; except in \"C.\u00a0leptosepala\" &lt;a href=\"Subspecies\"&gt;ssp.&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\"howellii\" that has pollen with rounded apertures all over the surface (pantoporate) or an intermediate type (pantocolporate), and in \"C.\u00a0palustris\" &lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28botany%29\"&gt;var.&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\"alba\", that shows both pollen types. Each carpel contains several &lt;a href=\"ovule\"&gt;ovule&lt;/a&gt;s set along the &lt;a href=\"ventral\"&gt;ventral&lt;/a&gt; suture. These mostly develop into &lt;a href=\"Sessility%20%28botany%29\"&gt;sessile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Follicle%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;follicle&lt;/a&gt;s, with elliptic to globular light brown to black seeds without wings, dependent on the species between \u00bd\u20131\u00bd\u00a0mm. In \"C.\u00a0scaposa\" follicles are &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stipitate\"&gt;stipitate&lt;/a&gt; and in \"C.\u00a0leptosepala\" short stipitate to sessile. \"C.\u00a0natans\" grows floating in fresh waters or on mud, but all other species are terrestrials that grow in moist soils.\nKey to the species.\nThis key makes use of the taxonomic opinions and characters described in Smit (1973).\nTaxonomy.\nTaxonomic history.\nThe oldest &lt;a href=\"Species%20description\"&gt;description&lt;/a&gt; that is generally acknowledged in the botanical literature dates from 1700 under the name \"Populago\" by &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Pitton%20de%20Tournefort\"&gt;Joseph Pitton de Tournefort&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//books.google.nl/books/reader%3Fid%3D2BkOAAAAQAAJ%26amp%3Bhl%3Dnl%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Boutput%3Dreader%26amp%3Bsource%3Dgbs_atb_hover%26amp%3Bpg%3DGBS.PA273\"&gt;part 1 of his Institutiones rei herbariae&lt;/a&gt;. He distinguished between \"P. flore major\", \"P. flore minor\" and \"P. flore plena\", and already says all of these are synonymous to \"Caltha palustris\", without mentioning any previous author. As a plant name published before 1 May 1753, \"Populago\" Tourn. is &lt;a href=\"Validly%20published%20name\"&gt;invalid&lt;/a&gt;. And so is the first description as \"Caltha palustris\" by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Carl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Genera%20Plantarum\"&gt;Genera Plantarum&lt;/a&gt; of 1737. But Linnaeus re-describes the species under the same name in &lt;a href=\"Species%20Plantarum\"&gt;Species Plantarum&lt;/a&gt; of 1 May 1753, thus providing the &lt;a href=\"Correct%20name%20%28botany%29\"&gt;correct name&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Caltha palustris\" is a highly variable species. When the growing season is shorter, plants are generally much smaller and may root at the nodes of the stems after flowering. Through history, many proposals have been made to split it into different (often numerous) taxa. Popular characters to distinguish between taxa concern the follicle. Most of the differences between populations are probably &lt;a href=\"Phenotypic%20trait\"&gt;phenotypic&lt;/a&gt; adaptations to particular circumstances without a genetic basis. Variability within populations is also considerable. Varieties that are widely recognised are \"C. palustris\" var. \"palustris\", \"C. palustris\" var. \"radicans\" (small plants with decumbent stems rooting at the nodes), \"C. palustris\" var. \"araneosa\" (big plants with erect stems forming young plants at the nodes), \"C. palustris\" var. \"alba\" (with white flowers) and \"C. palustris\" var. \"purpurea\" (with magenta flowers).\n\"Caltha leptosepala\" also is highly variable. There may be mostly one or mostly two flowers per stem, many lanceolate sepals or fewer ovate sepals, smaller hart-shaped or larger kidney-shaped leaves, and pollen may be of two different types. Populations on the US westcoast and the US Rocky Mountains consistently differ from each other by fixed combinations of these character states and two subspecies are distinguished: ssp. \"leptosepala\" and ssp. \"howellii\". Curiously, these fixed combinations cannot be found in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and in Alaska. For this reason the subspecies status is generally preferred over distinguishing a separate species (\"Caltha biflora\").\n\"Caltha sagittata\" has a rather large distribution. Usually the leaves have so called appendages, which are lobes at the base that are at a sharp angle with the top lobe. In some northern forms these appendages are in the same plane as the remainder of the leafblade, and these plants are sometimes recognised as \"C. alata\". Some character states gradually change over its distribution area, and the angle of the basal lobes does not seem to be special in this respect.\nThe remaining species vary less and have not been divided into subtaxa.\nModern classification.\nHistorically, the genus \"Caltha\" has been divided over two sections: \"Populago\" (now \"Caltha\") that included all Northern Hemisphere species, and \"Psychrophila\" that contained all Southern Hemisphere species. The latter is sometimes regarded as a separate genus, but other authors find the morphological differences too small to legitimate that status. Support for both opinions can still be found all over scientific and colloquial sources.\nPhylogeny.\nGenetic analysis suggest that three &lt;a href=\"monophyly\"&gt;monophyletic groups&lt;/a&gt; can be identified. \"C. natans\" turns out to be &lt;a href=\"Sister%20group\"&gt;sister&lt;/a&gt; to all other species. It also turns out that \"C. leptosepala\" is the sister of all Southern Hemisphere species and should be moved into the \"Psychrophila\" group. Within that section the New Zealand and Australian species form one cluster, \"C. appendiculata\" and \"C. dionaeifolia\" form a second cluster, while the third South American species, \"C. sagittata\", is sister to both these clusters. The remaining Northern Hemisphere species, \"C. palustris\" and \"C. scaposa\" make up the new content of the \"Caltha\" group. This suggests the genus originates in the Northern Hemisphere, and dispersed from North America to South America and from there to New Zealand and Australia. Relations between the species are represented by the following tree.\nReassigned species.\nSome species that were described as \"Caltha\" have been reassigned to other genera later on.\nEtymology.\nThe generic name \"Caltha\" is derived from the (kalathos), meaning \"goblet\", and is said to refer to the shape of the flower.\nDistribution.\n\"Caltha\" species are found in the cold and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, the Andes and Patagonia, and alpine areas in Australia and New Zealand. It is absent from lower altitudes in the tropics and subtropics, in Africa, on Greenland and some other arctic island, from Antarctica and subantarctic islands and from oceanic islands. \"C. natans\" occurs in Siberia and North America, but not in Europe. \"C. palustris\" has the widest distribution and is present in the cold and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, but cannot be found in the Western United States. \"C. scaposa\" is an alpine species with a limited distribution on the south-eastern rim of the Highland of Tibet. \"Caltha leptosepala\" occurs in western North-America from Alaska to California and Colorado. \"C. sagittata\" is another species that occurs in moist alpine meadows, in this case from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, growing at less altitude further from the equator. \"C. appendiculata\" occurs in the moist mountains and hills of southern Patagonia. The remaining four species all have limited distribution areas: \"C. dionaeifolia\" on the southern tip of Patagonia, \"C. introloba\" in the Australian Alps and on Tasmania, \"C. novae-zelandiae\" in the mountains of North and South Island of New Zealand, while \"C. obtusa\" is restricted to the South Island. \"Caltha palustris\" is cultivated as a garden ornamental in all temperate regions and may sometimes have escaped.\nEcology.\nInformation about the ecology of \"Caltha\" species is scarce except for \"C. palustris\". This species contains a number of noxious chemicals such as &lt;a href=\"anemonin\"&gt;anemonin&lt;/a&gt;, a trait it shares with other ranunculids, and this is probably the reason members of the entire family are avoided by vertebrate animals. Beetles and mining fly larvae cause little damage in \"C. palustris\". Pollination is mediated by a lot of different insects, but most prominently by flies, bees and beetles.\nAlthough it was suggested that pollination in \"C. palustris\" could be assisted by rain, there is also proof for self-infertility. When ripe follicles open, they form a \"splash cup\" from which seeds are expelled if raindrops hit them at the right angle. \"C. palustris\" seeds also have some spongy tissue that makes them float on water, until they wash up in a location that may be suitable for this species to grow. \"C. introloba\" was shown to have a life cycle that is adapted to snow cover and a short growing season. Flowerbuds have fully developed when the first snow remains, so that when it melts in spring the flowers can open immediately.\nSeeds germinate better and faster after a cold period."
