His tally is the third highest in this league, after &lt;a href=\"Gerd%20M%C3%BCller\"&gt;Gerd M\u00fcller&lt;/a&gt;'s 365 goals and &lt;a href=\"Klaus%20Fischer\"&gt;Klaus Fischer&lt;/a&gt;'s 268.\nAfter playing for amateur club Gr\u00fcn-Wei\u00df Holt as a youth, Heynckes started his professional career in 1964 with his &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B6nchengladbach\"&gt;hometown&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach\"&gt;Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach&lt;/a&gt; who were then in the &lt;a href=\"Regionalliga%20West%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29\"&gt;second division&lt;/a&gt;. In 1965, the club, managed by &lt;a href=\"Hennes%20Weisweiler\"&gt;Hennes Weisweiler&lt;/a&gt;, achieved promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt;, with the teenaged striker scoring 23 goals in 25 matches in his debut season.\nIn August 1965, Heynckes scored his first two Bundesliga goals against &lt;a href=\"SC%20Tasmania%201900%20Berlin\"&gt;SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. He scored 27 Bundesliga goals in two seasons for Borussia before joining &lt;a href=\"Hannover%2096\"&gt;Hannover 96&lt;/a&gt;, where he spent three years and scored 25 times in 86 league matches.\nHe returned to M\u00f6nchengladbach in 1970, with the club having just won the first &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20German%20football%20champions\"&gt;league title&lt;/a&gt; in its history. With Heynckes, who scored 19 times in 33 matches, Gladbach became the first club to retain the Bundesliga title in &lt;a href=\"1970%E2%80%9371%20Bundesliga\"&gt;1970\u201371&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1971%E2%80%9372%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1971\u201372 European Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Heynckes scored twice in an extraordinary 7\u20131 win against &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Italian%20football%20champions\"&gt;Italian champions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt;. The match, however, was forced to be replayed after a &lt;a href=\"Beverage%20can\"&gt;drinks can&lt;/a&gt; had been thrown onto the pitch by a spectator, hitting Inter's &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Boninsegna\"&gt;Roberto Boninsegna&lt;/a&gt;. Borussia drew the replayed home leg 0\u20130 and were eliminated 4\u20132 on &lt;a href=\"Two-legged%20tie\"&gt;aggregate&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1973, after eliminating Dutch club &lt;a href=\"FC%20Twente\"&gt;Twente&lt;/a&gt; 5\u20131 on aggregate in the semi-finals, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach became the first German side to reach the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20UEFA%20Cup%20and%20Europa%20League%20finals\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Borussia lost the away leg of the final against &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 at &lt;a href=\"Anfield\"&gt;Anfield&lt;/a&gt;, after the match initially had to be abandoned after 27 minutes due to a waterlogged pitch. During the match, Heynckes had a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty kick&lt;/a&gt; saved by &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Clemence\"&gt;Ray Clemence&lt;/a&gt;, denying his side a decisive &lt;a href=\"Away%20goals%20rule\"&gt;away goal&lt;/a&gt;. In the return leg, Heynckes scored both goals in Gladbach's 2\u20130 win. The English team, however, prevailed 3\u20132 on aggregate to lift the trophy. With 12 goals, Heynckes was joint top scorer of the competition with Twente's &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Jeuring\"&gt;Jan Jeuring&lt;/a&gt;. Despite disappointment in Europe, Gladbach ended the &lt;a href=\"1972%E2%80%9373%20Bundesliga\"&gt;1972\u201373 season&lt;/a&gt; with success in the &lt;a href=\"1972%E2%80%9373%20DFB-Pokal\"&gt;DFB-Pokal&lt;/a&gt; final, beating &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln\"&gt;1. FC K\u00f6ln&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Rheinstadion\"&gt;Rheinstadion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"D%C3%BCsseldorf\"&gt;D\u00fcsseldorf&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1973%E2%80%9374%20Bundesliga\"&gt;1973\u201374 season&lt;/a&gt;, Heynckes was joint &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Bundesliga%20top%20scorers\"&gt;top goalscorer&lt;/a&gt; in the Bundesliga, alongside &lt;a href=\"Gerd%20M%C3%BCller\"&gt;Gerd M\u00fcller&lt;/a&gt;, with 30 goals. His M\u00f6nchengladbach side finished second in the table, with M\u00fcller's &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; winning a record third consecutive &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20German%20football%20champions\"&gt;Bundesliga title&lt;/a&gt;. Heynckes was also the top scorer of the &lt;a href=\"1973%E2%80%9374%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;1973\u201374 European Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; with eight goals. In this competition, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach were knocked out in the semi-finals by &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;, losing 2\u20131 on aggregate.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1974%E2%80%9375%20Bundesliga\"&gt;1974\u201375&lt;/a&gt;, \"die Fohlen\" won their third Bundesliga title, with Heynckes finishing as the league's outright &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Bundesliga%20top%20scorers\"&gt;top goalscorer&lt;/a&gt; with 27 goals. The club also won its first European trophy with success in the &lt;a href=\"1974%E2%80%9375%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. After a 0\u20130 draw in the home leg of &lt;a href=\"1975%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;the final&lt;/a&gt; against Twente, Heynckes, who missed the home match, scored a &lt;a href=\"hat-trick\"&gt;hat-trick&lt;/a&gt; in a 5\u20131 away win in &lt;a href=\"Enschede\"&gt;Enschede&lt;/a&gt;. This victory made Gladbach the first German winners of the UEFA Cup. Again, Heynckes was tournament top scorer, this time with ten goals. Altogether, Heynckes scored 23 goals in 21 games in the UEFA Cup, making him the ninth-highest goalscorer in the history of the competition, and the only member of &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20and%20Europa%20League%20records%20and%20statistics%23All-time%20top%20goalscorers\"&gt;the top ten&lt;/a&gt; to have scored at a ratio of over a goal per game.\nAfter regaining the title, Weisweiler left Borussia to become manager of &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Udo%20Lattek\"&gt;Udo Lattek&lt;/a&gt;, under whom Heynckes would later begin his coaching career. Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach went on to win the &lt;a href=\"1975%E2%80%9376%20Bundesliga\"&gt;1975\u201376&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1976%E2%80%9377%20Bundesliga\"&gt;1976\u201377&lt;/a&gt; Bundesliga titles, matching Bayern's feat of three titles in a row set earlier in the decade. In 1977, Borussia also reached its first &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20finals\"&gt;European Cup final&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"1975%E2%80%9376%20European%20Cup\"&gt;previous season's competition&lt;/a&gt;, Heynckes had been top scorer with six goals. In &lt;a href=\"1976%E2%80%9377%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1976\u201377 European Cup&lt;/a&gt;, he was less prolific, scoring only one goal in the first round match against &lt;a href=\"FK%20Austria%20Wien\"&gt;Austria Wien&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"1977%20European%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;, Gladbach again lost out to Liverpool, losing 3\u20131 at &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Olimpico\"&gt;Stadio Olimpico&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeynckes scored 18 goals in the &lt;a href=\"1977%E2%80%9378%20Bundesliga\"&gt;1977\u201378 Bundesliga season&lt;/a&gt;, including five in the record &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach%2012%E2%80%930%20Borussia%20Dortmund\"&gt;12\u20130&lt;/a&gt; win against &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20Dortmund\"&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt; on the final day of the season. However, this was not enough to secure a fourth successive title, as 1. FC K\u00f6ln won their final match against &lt;a href=\"FC%20St.%20Pauli\"&gt;FC St. Pauli&lt;/a&gt; 5\u20130 to take first place on &lt;a href=\"goal%20difference\"&gt;goal difference&lt;/a&gt;. Heynckes scored four goals in the &lt;a href=\"1977%E2%80%9378%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1977\u201378 European Cup&lt;/a&gt; as the team reached the semi-finals, where they were again defeated by Liverpool. Altogether, Heynckes scored 51 goals in 64 matches in European club competitions. His average of 0.8 goals per match is only bettered by compatriot Gerd M\u00fcller, who achieved an average of 0.89 goals per match.\nHeynckes ended his playing career in 1978 and began studying for his coaching licence at the &lt;a href=\"German%20Sport%20University%20Cologne\"&gt;Deutsche Sporthochschule K\u00f6ln&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his club career, he won four &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20German%20football%20champions\"&gt;Bundesliga titles&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"DFB-Pokal\"&gt;DFB-Pokal&lt;/a&gt; and one UEFA Cup. He is the third-highest goalscorer in Bundesliga history and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach's top goalscorer in the competition with 195 goals.\nInternational level.\nHeynckes made 39 appearances for the &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;West Germany national team&lt;/a&gt; and scored 14 goals.\nIn February 1967, he made his international debut at age 21, scoring in a 5\u20131 friendly win against &lt;a href=\"Morocco%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeynckes was a member of the West Germany team that won the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%201972\"&gt;1972 UEFA European Championship&lt;/a&gt;, playing 90 minutes in the 3\u20130 win over the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%201972%20Final\"&gt;the final&lt;/a&gt;. He was named by &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; as one of seven German players in the official &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20European%20Football%20Championship%20Teams%20of%20the%20Tournament\"&gt;Team of the Tournament&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeynckes was included in West Germany's squad for the &lt;a href=\"1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1974 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, which was held in West Germany. Despite his excellent form at club level, however, he spent most of the tournament on the bench as Gerd M\u00fcller, the national team's &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20football%20team%23Top%20goalscorers\"&gt;all-time top goalscorer&lt;/a&gt;, was used as the starting centre forward by coach &lt;a href=\"Helmut%20Sch%C3%B6n\"&gt;Helmut Sch\u00f6n&lt;/a&gt;. Heynckes was in the starting line-up for West Germany's opening two fixtures against &lt;a href=\"Chile%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; but then played no further part due to injury and \"die Nationalelf\" won their &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20finals\"&gt;second World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, beating the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 in &lt;a href=\"1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;the final&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Olympiastadion%20%28Munich%29\"&gt;Olympiastadion&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, Heynckes said of his experience at the 1974 World Cup, \"I was in the starting lineup for the German national team competing for the World Cup, but after an injury I was sidelined for the entire final. This was the greatest disappointment of my life, but it spurred me on and became my greatest source of motivation.\"\nManagerial career.\n1979\u201391: Early career.\nBorussia M\u00f6nchengladbach.\nAfter his playing career, Heynckes stayed with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and served the club for eight more years, first as an assistant and then as a manager, succeeding &lt;a href=\"Udo%20Lattek\"&gt;Udo Lattek&lt;/a&gt; in this position in 1979 at age 34. Heynckes took over on 1 July 1979 and in the &lt;a href=\"1979%E2%80%9380%20Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach%20season\"&gt;1979\u201380 season&lt;/a&gt;, Heynckes led M\u00f6nchengladbach to the &lt;a href=\"1980%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1980 UEFA Cup final&lt;/a&gt;, where they lost to &lt;a href=\"Eintracht%20Frankfurt\"&gt;Eintracht Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;.

However, a 4\u20130 loss at the &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium\"&gt;Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in the second leg saw Borussia eliminated on the &lt;a href=\"away%20goals%20rule\"&gt;away goals rule&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, Heynckes described it as \"the worst night of my career\".\nIn his &lt;a href=\"1986%E2%80%9387%20Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach%20season\"&gt;final season&lt;/a&gt; in charge, Heynckes led M\u00f6nchengladbach to another third-place finish and the &lt;a href=\"1986%E2%80%9387%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-final.

His opposing coach that day, &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Rehhagel\"&gt;Otto Rehhagel&lt;/a&gt;, is the only coach who has managed more Bundesliga matches, with over 800.\nAfter finishing the Bundesliga season in second place, Bayern faced champions Dortmund in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20DFB-Pokal%20Final\"&gt;2012 DFB-Pokal final&lt;/a&gt;, losing 5\u20132.\nDespite their disappointments in domestic competitions, Heynckes' Bayern had qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2012%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;2012 Champions League Final&lt;/a&gt; in April 2012, defeating &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; on penalty kicks in the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;semi-finals&lt;/a&gt;. In the final, held at the Allianz Arena, \"die Roten\" faced English club &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;. Despite controlling most of the match and taking a 1\u20130 lead in the 83rd minute, Bayern lost the match 4\u20133 on &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shootout\"&gt;penalties&lt;/a&gt;. This meant that Bayern had finished as runners-up in all three major competitions in which they had competed in &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season\"&gt;2011\u201312&lt;/a&gt;.\n2012\u201313 season.\nBayern started the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season\"&gt;2012\u201313 season&lt;/a&gt; by defeating Borussia Dortmund 2\u20131 in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20DFL-Supercup\"&gt;DFL-Supercup&lt;/a&gt;. It was a significant result as the Bavarians had lost all three encounters with \"die Schwarzgelben\" in the previous season, and the last five encounters between the clubs overall. Bayern's &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga campaign&lt;/a&gt; began with a record-breaking eight consecutive wins before they suffered their only league defeat of the season at Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern quickly regained form and went into the winter break nine points clear at the top of the table.\nOn 16 January 2013, Bayern announced that former Barcelona coach &lt;a href=\"Pep%20Guardiola\"&gt;Pep Guardiola&lt;/a&gt; would replace Heynckes in July 2013. General manager &lt;a href=\"Uli%20Hoene%C3%9F\"&gt;Uli Hoene\u00df&lt;/a&gt; later stated that it was not Heynckes' decision to leave Bayern at the end of the season and was forced by the club's wish to appoint Guardiola. Though the club's press release announcing Bayern's agreement with Guardiola had claimed Heynckes would be retiring on the expiration of his contract, he stated he would not make a decision on his future until the end of the season.\nAfter returning from the winter break, Bayern only dropped two points in the entire second half of the Bundesliga season, winning 14 consecutive matches from January onwards and being confirmed as &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20German%20football%20champions\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; on 6 April 2013. This was the earliest a team had ever won the Bundesliga, and Bayern broke &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season%23Broken%20records\"&gt;several other records&lt;/a&gt; during the season including; most points in a season (91), highest league winning points margin (25), most wins in a season (29), longest winning streak in a season (14), most clean sheets in a season (21), best goal difference in a season (+80) and fewest goals conceded in a season (18). The team scored in every match and suffered only one defeat.\nOn 23 February 2013, Heynckes participated in his 1,000th Bundesliga match as player and manager combined, making him the man with the second most appearances in Bundesliga history. On 14 May 2013, he took charge of a Bundesliga match for what he claimed to be the final time. Fittingly, the match was away at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Heynckes' hometown club who he served for over 20 years as a player and coach.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, Bayern faced Barcelona at the semi-final stage, thrashing the favourites 7\u20130 on aggregate to reach a second successive &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20finals\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;. The performance was seen as a display of physical and tactical superiority of Bayern over Barcelona. In the &lt;a href=\"2013%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;2013 Champions League final&lt;/a&gt;, Heynckes' Bayern defeated Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund 2\u20131 at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, making him the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20winning%20managers\"&gt;fourth manager&lt;/a&gt; (after &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Happel\"&gt;Ernst Happel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ottmar%20Hitzfeld\"&gt;Ottmar Hitzfeld&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&lt;/a&gt;) to win the competition with two clubs.\nOn 1 June 2013, Heynckes took charge of Bayern for the last time in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20DFB-Pokal%20Final\"&gt;2013 DFB-Pokal final&lt;/a&gt; against VfB Stuttgart. Bayern won the match 3\u20132, becoming the first German club to complete &lt;a href=\"Treble%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;the treble&lt;/a&gt; of the domestic league, the domestic cup and the European Cup. Former Bayern and &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Beckenbauer\"&gt;Franz Beckenbauer&lt;/a&gt;, who led \"die Roten\" to three consecutive European Cup wins in the 1970s, called Heynckes' 2012\u201313 side \"the best Bayern team ever\", a view shared by the club's legendary &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Karl-Heinz%20Rummenigge\"&gt;Karl-Heinz Rummenigge&lt;/a&gt;. He finished with a record of 83 wins, 12 draws, and 14 losses.\nConsequently, he won the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Coach%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;FIFA World Coach of the Year 2013&lt;/a&gt; finishing ahead of &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp\"&gt;J\u00fcrgen Klopp&lt;/a&gt; (second) and Sir &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Ferguson\"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; (third).\nOn 4 June 2013, Heynckes announced he would not coach a team during the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season\"&gt;2013\u201314 season&lt;/a&gt;. On 21 June, in an interview with \"&lt;a href=\"Der%20Spiegel\"&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;\", Heynckes said, \"After everything that's happened over the past two years, I'm ready for some peace and quiet. After this string of successes, I could transfer to just about any club in Europe. I have a problem with the finality of saying 'never'. But I can assure you that I have no intention of coaching again. I had a worthy ending.\" He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Pep%20Guardiola\"&gt;Pep Guardiola&lt;/a&gt;, who had his first training session on 26 June 2013.\n2017\u201318: Return to management.\nFourth stint at Bayern.\nOn 6 October 2017, Heynckes was appointed Bayern Munich manager until the end of the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season\"&gt;2017\u201318 season&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Carlo Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt; was dismissed and &lt;a href=\"Willy%20Sagnol\"&gt;Willy Sagnol&lt;/a&gt; managed the team on 1 October against &lt;a href=\"Hertha%20BSC\"&gt;Hertha BSC&lt;/a&gt;. Heynckes officially took the role on 9 October. His first match in his fourth stint was a 5\u20130 win against Freiburg.\nOn 4 April 2018, Heynckes set a new Champions League record of most consecutive wins as a manager with twelve wins by defeating Sevilla in the quarter-final 1st leg match in &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing the record of ten wins in a row set by Louis van Gaal and Carlo Ancelotti.\nBayern president &lt;a href=\"Uli%20Hoene%C3%9F\"&gt;Uli Hoene\u00df&lt;/a&gt; said numerous times in interviews that he wanted Heynckes to stay as manager for the 2018\u201319 season. Heynckes said in an interview with &lt;a href=\"Sport%20Bild\"&gt;Sport Bild&lt;/a&gt; that he was only going to manage Bayern until the end of the season.\nHeynckes managed Bayern in 26 Bundesliga matches. He won 22, lost three and one match ended with a draw. In the Champions League, Heynckes was in charge of 10 matches. He won seven, lost one and two matches ended with a draw.

This has earned him the nickname \"&lt;a href=\"Osram\"&gt;Osram&lt;/a&gt;\" (in reference to a German lighting manufacturer). &lt;a href=\"Rudi%20Gores\"&gt;Rudi Gores&lt;/a&gt; is said to have first used this moniker to describe Heynckes. Later, the nickname became universally known among German football aficionados and has been used by the media as well.\nHonours.\nClub.\nBorussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\nInternational.\nWest Germany\nManager.\nBayern Munich\nReal Madrid\nSchalke 04\nIndividual.\nPlayer\nManager"
