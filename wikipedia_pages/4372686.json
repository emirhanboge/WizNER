    "text": "The Farmers Trading Company Ltd (branded as Farmers) is a &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; mid-market &lt;a href=\"department%20store\"&gt;department store&lt;/a&gt; chain. Headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Flat%20Bush\"&gt;Flat Bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auckland\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, Farmers operates 58 stores across New Zealand, specialising in family fashion, beauty, homewares, furniture, large appliances and whiteware.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Robert%20Laidlaw\"&gt;Robert Laidlaw&lt;/a&gt; founded \"Laidlaw Leeds\" in 1909, which sold agricultural supplies through mail order catalogues, following a successful American model. In 1910, a group of Auckland members of the Farmers Union formed the \"Farmers Union Indenting and Trading Association\". The Clevedon branch, for instance, approved the formation of such an association at a meeting held in July 1910. In 1916, the trading association was converted into the \"Farmers' Union Trading Co (Auckland) Ltd\". In 1917, the Farmers' Union Trading Company approached Laidlaw Leeds with an offer to merge, which Laidlaw accepted; he became the managing director of the new venture, the Farmers' Trading Company. The company soon expanded into retail and adopted the &lt;a href=\"department%20store\"&gt;department store&lt;/a&gt; model. There had also been an unrelated, older Farmers Department Store in Sydney, Australia.\nThe centre of operations was a high rise warehouse and office complex in Auckland's &lt;a href=\"Hobson%20Street%2C%20Auckland\"&gt;Hobson Street&lt;/a&gt;. In 1920 a retail space was opened to the public in the building. The co-op also bought many local stores in the Auckland province in 1920, by which time it had 32 stores, and offered &lt;a href=\"Preferred%20stock\"&gt;preference shares&lt;/a&gt; to urban members.\nIn the 1930s a large wing was built onto the older 1914 building which included the Harbour View Tea Rooms. The architect involved, R. A. Lippencott, also gave the enlarged building a new facade in the new modern &lt;a href=\"Art-Deco\"&gt;Art-Deco&lt;/a&gt; style. Hobson Street was not a very good position for a department store, so copying similar arrangement by stores in American cities, Laidlaw arranged for a free bus to shuttle people from &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Street%2C%20Auckland\"&gt;Queen Street&lt;/a&gt; to the Hobson Street store. This was later augmented by a free tram to &lt;a href=\"Karangahape%20Road\"&gt;Karangahape Road&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver successive years the adjacent sites were covered with warehouses and administration blocks for the growing business. Laidlaw, a teetotaler, made a point of buying the pub directly next door, The Grosvenor, and turning it into offices. As well as its roof top playground and tearooms, Farmers was also noted for its high-rise parking building connected to the shop by an elevated sky way. Like many buildings from the 1920s onwards it had electric lifts which multiplied in number as the building grew in size. The store also boasted the first escalators in Auckland which were opened in 1955 by the Mayor of Auckland, Mr J H Luxford and Mrs Luxford. The Mayor cut the ribbon and the official party travelled up the escalators followed by a crowd of curious Aucklanders, along with the store's mascot Hector the parrot. The eight banks of escalators were the largest installation in the Southern Hemisphere.\nAfter closing in 1991, the large CBD store stood empty for several years before it was converted into an upscale hotel which opened in 1998. Currently, most Farmers stores are &lt;a href=\"anchor%20store\"&gt;anchor store&lt;/a&gt;s in shopping malls, with their larger stores in the suburbs.\nThe company grew from one store during the 1910s to 56 by 1990 through opportunism and take-overs. Farmers and the &lt;a href=\"DEKA%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;DEKA&lt;/a&gt; discount merchandise chain were joined as Farmers Deka Ltd from 1992. The DEKA chain closed in July 2001 after financial difficulty in competing with &lt;a href=\"The%20Warehouse\"&gt;The Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"discount%20store\"&gt;discount store&lt;/a&gt;s. Farmers Deka Ltd was then renamed Farmers Holdings Ltd.\nFarmers has traditionally been a middle market retailer, on par with &lt;a href=\"Sears%2C%20Roebuck%20and%20Company\"&gt;Sears&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"J%20C%20Penney\"&gt;J C Penney&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. With the recent development of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warehouse\"&gt;The Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Walmart\"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; type store), Farmers made a decision to become a far more fashionable shopping destination, ranging an increasing amount of branded product. Where Farmers once would have faced competition from The Warehouse (nationwide) and various small chain stores, they've established themselves well apart from this discount retailer. Farmers still face competition from remaining department stores &lt;a href=\"Smith%20%26amp%3B%20Caughey%27s\"&gt;Smith &amp; Caughey's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ballantynes\"&gt;Ballantynes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"H%20%26amp%3B%20J%20Smith\"&gt;H &amp; J Smith&lt;/a&gt;, none of which are nationwide.\nFarmers closed its Queen Street, Auckland, store in rented premises in 2014 at the conclusion of a long-term lease. In November 2015, the company opened a new store located on the corner of Queen and Victoria Streets, formerly occupied by stationery retailer &lt;a href=\"Whitcoulls\"&gt;Whitcoulls&lt;/a&gt;, renovating it as a three-level Farmers department store.\nDepartments.\nFarmers departments include &lt;a href=\"womenswear\"&gt;womenswear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beauty\"&gt;beauty&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;serviced cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perfume\"&gt;fine fragrance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Personal%20hygiene\"&gt;health &amp; beauty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sunglasses\"&gt;sunglasses&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"lingerie\"&gt;lingerie&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"pyjamas\"&gt;sleepwear&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"menswear\"&gt;menswear&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Undergarment\"&gt;mercery&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Fashion%20accessory\"&gt;accessories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"footwear\"&gt;footwear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"luggage\"&gt;luggage&lt;/a&gt;; home, including &lt;a href=\"kitchenware\"&gt;kitchenware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tableware\"&gt;tableware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"giftware\"&gt;giftware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"laundry\"&gt;laundry&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Linens\"&gt;manchester&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"bathroom\"&gt;bathroom&lt;/a&gt;ware; &lt;a href=\"small%20appliance\"&gt;small appliance&lt;/a&gt;s; children's including &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20clothing\"&gt;childrenswear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nursery%20%28room%29\"&gt;nursery&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"toys\"&gt;toys&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"furniture\"&gt;furniture&lt;/a&gt;; with &lt;a href=\"Consumer%20electronics\"&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Major%20appliance\"&gt;large appliances/whiteware&lt;/a&gt; in flagship stores such as &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morningside%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;St Lukes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas Shop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"confectionery\"&gt;confectionery&lt;/a&gt; appear October\u2013December. Fellow James Pascoe Group companies &lt;a href=\"James%20Pascoe%20Group%23Goldmark\"&gt;Goldmark&lt;/a&gt; (previously fellow JPG brand &lt;a href=\"James%20Pascoe%20Group%23Prouds\"&gt;Prouds&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"James%20Pascoe%20Group%23Stevens\"&gt;Stevens&lt;/a&gt; also have &lt;a href=\"store-within-a-store\"&gt;store-within-a-store&lt;/a&gt; outlets within selected Farmers stores.\nSince the 2003 purchase by the James Pascoe Group, the chain has focussed on the lucrative fashion apparel and beauty categories. Unprofitable and loss-making departments such as hardware and computers were discontinued.\nOwnership.\nFarmers Holdings Ltd is privately owned by the &lt;a href=\"James%20Pascoe%20Group\"&gt;James Pascoe Group&lt;/a&gt;, in turn owned by Anne Norman and family. James Pascoe Ltd and Fisher &amp; Paykel Finance bought Farmers on 6 November 2003 from Foodlands Associates for NZ$311m. The business was split into the retail and finance arms with James Pascoe holding the retail arm and Fisher &amp; Paykel Finance the finance arm which includes the Farmers Finance Card."
