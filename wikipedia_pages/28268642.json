    "text": "The Africa Women's Sevens is the continental championship for women's international &lt;a href=\"rugby%20sevens\"&gt;rugby sevens&lt;/a&gt; in Africa. The tournament sanctioned and sponsored by &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Africa\"&gt;Rugby Africa&lt;/a&gt; (previously CAR) which is the rugby union &lt;a href=\"sports%20governing%20body\"&gt;governing body&lt;/a&gt; for the continent.\nThe first official regional 7s championship for international women's teams from Africa was held in Tunisia in 2004, although this only included teams from Northern Africa. The first World Cup Sevens qualifier for women's teams from Africa was held in Uganda in 2008. Since then, African championships have periodically served as pre-qualifying competitions for the Rugby 7s World Cup, or other sevens tournaments such as at the Summer Olympics.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Rugby%20sevens\"&gt;Rugby sevens&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 also known as 7-a-side, or 7s \u2014 is a short form of the sport of &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; that was first played in 1883. The first (men's) internationals took place in 1973. As &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20rugby%20union\"&gt;women's rugby union&lt;/a&gt; developed in the 1960s and 1970s the format became very popular as it allowed games, and entire leagues, to be developed in countries even when player numbers were small, and it remains the main form the women's game is played in most parts of the world.\nHowever, although the first &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20international%20rugby%20union\"&gt;women's international rugby union&lt;/a&gt; 15-a-side test match took place in 1982, it was not until 1997 before the first &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20International%20Rugby%20Union%20Sevens\"&gt;women's international 7s&lt;/a&gt; tournaments were played, when the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Women%27s%20Sevens%231997\"&gt;1997 Hong Kong Sevens&lt;/a&gt; included a women's tournament for the first time. Over the next decade the number of tournaments grew, with almost every region developing regular championship competitions. This reached its zenith with 2009's inaugural &lt;a href=\"2009%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20Sevens%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament\"&gt;women's tournament for the Rugby World Cup Sevens&lt;/a&gt;, shortly followed by the announcement that women's rugby sevens will be included in the Olympics from 2016.\nHonours.\nWinners of continent-wide African Championship tournaments for national women's sevens teams:* \nThe following are details of all regional women's international championships played in Africa, listed chronologically with the earliest first, with all result details, where known (included are the CAR Women's Sevens and other official regional championships, e.g. CAR North and South tournaments).\n2004 CAR Tournaments.\nCAR North Tournament 2004.\nPlayed in Tunisia.\nGroup Stage.\nGROUP A\nGROUP B\nClassification Stage.\nSemi Finals\n5th/6th Place\n3rd/4th Place\nFinal\nCAR South Tournament 2004.\nOctober 2004. \nResults not available.
