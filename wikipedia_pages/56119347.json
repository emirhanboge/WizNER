    "text": "Michael Deveney (born 14 December 1965) is a Scottish former &lt;a href=\"Boxing\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt;, who represented the UK at the &lt;a href=\"1988%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1988 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; before a professional career that included winning the British &lt;a href=\"featherweight\"&gt;featherweight&lt;/a&gt; title in 1995.\nCareer.\nBorn in Elderslie, Deveney first made his mark as an amateur, representing the UK at the 1998 Olympics in &lt;a href=\"Seoul\"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"bantamweight\"&gt;bantamweight&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe made his professional debut in February 1991 with a points win over the unbeaten John George. A mixed record in his first four years as a professional included defeats at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Jones%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Barry Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elvis%20Parsley\"&gt;Elvis Parsley&lt;/a&gt;, but in January 1995 he got a shot at the vacant British featherweight title against &lt;a href=\"Wilson%20Docherty\"&gt;Wilson Docherty&lt;/a&gt;; Deveney won narrowly on points to become British champion. Deveney lost the title in his first defence eight months later, when he was outpointed by &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Jo%20Irwin\"&gt;Jon Jo Irwin&lt;/a&gt;. Previous to that title defence, he lost an 8 round non-title fight against Dean Phillips, who floored him twice en route to losing 5 of the 8 rounds to the Welshman.\nDeveney twice made unsuccessful challenges for the &lt;a href=\"BBBofC\"&gt;BBBofC&lt;/a&gt; Scottish Area title in 1996, both against &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Carr\"&gt;Brian Carr&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe continued boxing until 1998, finishing with a record of 22 wins, 19 losses, and 1 draw."
