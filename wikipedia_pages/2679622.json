    "text": "An ingredient is a substance that forms part of a &lt;a href=\"mixture\"&gt;mixture&lt;/a&gt; (in a general sense). For example, in &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s specify which ingredients are used to prepare a specific dish. Many commercial &lt;a href=\"product%20%28business%29\"&gt;products&lt;/a&gt; contain &lt;a href=\"secret%20ingredient\"&gt;secret ingredient&lt;/a&gt;s that are purported to make them better than competing products.

Thus all ingredients are &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aconstituent%23Noun\"&gt;constituent&lt;/a&gt;s, but not all constituents are ingredients.\nArtificial ingredient.\nAn artificial ingredient usually refers to an ingredient which is &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aartificial\"&gt;artificial&lt;/a&gt; or man-made, such as:"
