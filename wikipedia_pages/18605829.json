    "text": "Aliwan Fiesta is an annual event that gathers different &lt;a href=\"cultural%20festival\"&gt;cultural festival&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; in Star City Complex in &lt;a href=\"Pasay\"&gt;Pasay&lt;/a&gt; wherein contingents compete in &lt;a href=\"dance\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"parade\"&gt;parade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Float%20%28parade%29\"&gt;float&lt;/a&gt; competitions. Organized by &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;Manila Broadcasting Company&lt;/a&gt; (MBC) together with &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20Center%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Cultural Center of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; (CCP) and the cities of &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pasay\"&gt;Pasay&lt;/a&gt;, the event is dubbed as \"the Philippines' Grandest Fiesta,\" with prizes totaling &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20peso\"&gt;P&lt;/a&gt;3 million (roughly &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20dollar\"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;70,000). Aliwan Fiesta, which began in 2003, aims to showcase the different &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Filipino cultures&lt;/a&gt; and heritage not only to the people in &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Manila\"&gt;Metro Manila&lt;/a&gt; but also to the rest of the world. The contingents, meanwhile, aim to promote their respective regions both economically and &lt;a href=\"tourism\"&gt;tourism&lt;/a&gt;-wise. It was originally organized as a visual extravaganza for the &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; season, but it has since been held during the summer months of either April or May. \"Aliwan\" is a &lt;a href=\"Tagalog%20language\"&gt;Tagalog&lt;/a&gt; word for \"entertainment\" or \"amusement.\" Aliwan Fiesta festivities are covered live on &lt;a href=\"DZRH%20News%20Television\"&gt;DZRH News Television&lt;/a&gt; annually.\nCompetition.\nAliwan Fiesta is divided into three categories: Cultural Street Dance Competition (the main event), Float Parade, and \"Reyna ng Aliwan\" (Queen of Entertainment/Amusement) competition. Each of the country's &lt;a href=\"Regions%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;17 regions&lt;/a&gt; have the option to send up to two contingents representing its respective cultural festival, as well as an option to send a representing float and or Reyna ng Aliwan contestant. However, the roster of entries for the cultural dance and float competitions are limited. In 2008, the number of slots for cultural dance was increased from 20 to 24 groups, which was completed as early as January. Each contingent in the cultural street dance competition\u2014totaling up to 100 dancers as well as hundreds of musicians and support staff members\u2014have undergone stringent elimination cycles during various local festivals before being chosen to compete in Aliwan Fiesta. The highlight of the event is when all competing festivals show off their dance skills while parading for four kilometers (about 2\u00bd miles) along &lt;a href=\"Roxas%20Boulevard\"&gt;Roxas Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Quirino%20Grandstand\"&gt;Quirino Grandstand&lt;/a&gt; to Aliw Theater grounds located near CCP. The festivals range from the well-known such as &lt;a href=\"Dinagyang\"&gt;Dinagyang&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Iloilo%20City\"&gt;Iloilo City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sinulog\"&gt;Sinulog&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cebu%20City\"&gt;Cebu City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Panagbenga%20Festival\"&gt;Panagbenga&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Baguio\"&gt;Baguio&lt;/a&gt;, to the obscure but just-as-interesting feasts like Alikaraw of &lt;a href=\"Hilongos%2C%20Leyte\"&gt;Hilongos, Leyte&lt;/a&gt;, Padang-Padang of &lt;a href=\"Parang%2C%20Shariff%20Kabunsuan\"&gt;Parang, Shariff Kabunsuan&lt;/a&gt;, and Pamitinan Festival of &lt;a href=\"Rodriguez%2C%20Rizal\"&gt;Rodriguez, Rizal&lt;/a&gt;. Side events also include a bazaar featuring different regional products, a &lt;a href=\"photography\"&gt;photography&lt;/a&gt; contest, an inter-scholastic dance competition (interpreting dance tunes played on MBC radio stations), Filipino street games, and a &lt;a href=\"firework\"&gt;firework&lt;/a&gt;s display.\nMeanwhile, the participating floats are only allowed to use local &lt;a href=\"textile\"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"produce\"&gt;produce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, and other products specific in their representing city in decorating the vehicles. Each float, portraying local folklore and indigenous traditions, is topped by a participant of \"Reyna ng Aliwan\" serving as muse. Laoag's PAMULINAWEN festival has the distinction of winning the float competition the most number of times.\nThe province of CEBU, in turn, holds the record of the most wins in the Reyna ng Aliwan Pageant\u2014six consecutive times from 2009 until 2014, and recapturing the crown in 2016 and 2017. However in 2019, Cebu's Sinulog festival queen who won Reyna ng Aliwan was stripped of her title for having violated the terms and conditions of her reign. The Panagbenga festival queen assumed the title and her duties for the rest of the year\u2014the third time a Baguio lass wore the crown. The Reyna ng Aliwan pageant is considered the training ground of many national pageant winners, who have also gone on to compete\u2014and win\u2014international titles. Among these are Jamie Herrell and Karla Henry who won Miss Earth; Rizzini Alexis Gomez and Angeli Dione Gomez, who won the Miss Tourism International crowns back-to-back; Cynthia Thomalla, who was crowned Miss Eco International; Sharifa Aqeel who was named Miss Asia Pacific International; Vera Eumee Reiter, who won Mutya ng Pilipinas; as well as Mary Jean Lastimosa, Rogelie Catacutan, and Ma. Ahtisa Manalo, who won Bb. Pilipinas titles.\nThe top ten contingents in the cultural dance and float competitions receive cash prizes, with the top float winner receiving P500,000 (roughly US$11,000) and the winning cultural dance group getting P1 million (about US$23,000) as well as the bragging rights of becoming the champion of Aliwan Fiesta. Meanwhile, the \"Reyna ng Aliwan\" receives P100,000 (roughly US$2,300).\nAliwan Fiesta also takes pride in foreign exposure given to its winners. Lumad Basakanon of Cebu's Sinulog, Tribu Panayanon of Iloilo Dinagyang, and the Manggahan Festival of Guimaras have all represented the country in various international festivals overseas. Aliwan Fiesta itself was featured in the Philippine pavilions at the 2011 Prague Quadrennial on Performance Space and Design, held in the Czech Republic; the Philippine delegation won the special children's prize for its efforts.\nAliwan Fiesta winners.\nReyna ng Aliwan winners.\nCebu has won the crown in six consecutive years (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014) followed by Baguio (2005, 2006) then Davao, Bulacan and Laoag.\nCoffee table book.\nMBC presented a &lt;a href=\"coffee%20table%20book\"&gt;coffee table book&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 entitled \"Aliwan Fiesta: Celebrating Life In These 7,107 Islands\". It was documented by cultural affairs specialist Susan Isorena-Arcega, featuring various photographs taken during Aliwan Fiesta's first five years. The book aims to tackle the &lt;a href=\"Filipino%20people\"&gt;Filipino&lt;/a&gt;'s festive psyche, the multi-pronged treatise on what the Philippine festivals are rooted in, and the display of cultural heritage through dance and craftsmanship. A second volume entitled \"Aliwan Fiesta: The Festival of Champions,\" was published in 2013. A third volume is currently being compiled."
