    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"electronics\"&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt;, when describing a &lt;a href=\"voltage\"&gt;voltage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"current%20%28electricity%29\"&gt;current&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"step%20function\"&gt;step function&lt;/a&gt;, rise time is the time taken by a &lt;a href=\"Signal%20%28electrical%20engineering%29\"&gt;signal&lt;/a&gt; to change from a specified low value to a specified high value. These values may be expressed as &lt;a href=\"ratio\"&gt;ratio&lt;/a&gt;s or, equivalently, as &lt;a href=\"percentage\"&gt;percentage&lt;/a&gt;s with respect to a given reference value. In &lt;a href=\"analog%20electronics\"&gt;analog electronics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"digital%20electronics\"&gt;digital electronics&lt;/a&gt;, these percentages are commonly the 10% and 90% (or equivalently and ) of the output step height: however, other values are commonly used. For applications in control theory, according to , rise time is defined as \"the time required for the response to rise from to of its final value\"\", with 0% to 100% rise time common for &lt;a href=\"underdamped\"&gt;underdamped&lt;/a&gt; second order systems, 5% to 95% for &lt;a href=\"critically%20damped\"&gt;critically damped&lt;/a&gt; and 10% to 90% for &lt;a href=\"overdamped\"&gt;overdamped&lt;/a&gt; ones. According to , the term \"rise time\" applies to either positive or negative &lt;a href=\"step%20response\"&gt;step response&lt;/a&gt;, even if a displayed negative excursion is popularly termed &lt;a href=\"fall%20time\"&gt;fall time&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nRise time is an analog parameter of fundamental importance in &lt;a href=\"electronics\"&gt;high speed electronics&lt;/a&gt;, since it is a measure of the ability of a circuit to respond to fast input signals. There have been many efforts to reduce the rise times of circuits, generators, and data measuring and transmission equipment. These reductions tend to stem from research on faster &lt;a href=\"electronic%20device\"&gt;electron devices&lt;/a&gt; and from techniques of reduction in stray circuit parameters (mainly capacitances and inductances). For applications outside the realm of high speed &lt;a href=\"electronics\"&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt;, long (compared to the attainable state of the art) rise times are sometimes desirable: examples are the &lt;a href=\"Dimmer\"&gt;dimming&lt;/a&gt; of a light, where a longer rise-time results, amongst other things, in a longer life for the bulb, or in the control of analog signals by digital ones by means of an &lt;a href=\"analog%20switch\"&gt;analog switch&lt;/a&gt;, where a longer rise time means lower capacitive feedthrough, and thus lower coupling &lt;a href=\"noise\"&gt;noise&lt;/a&gt; to the controlled analog signal lines.\nFactors affecting rise time.\nFor a given system output, its rise time depend both on the rise time of input signal and on the characteristics of the &lt;a href=\"system\"&gt;system&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor example, rise time values in a resistive circuit are primarily due to stray &lt;a href=\"capacitance\"&gt;capacitance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"inductance\"&gt;inductance&lt;/a&gt;. Since every &lt;a href=\"electrical%20network\"&gt;circuit&lt;/a&gt; has not only &lt;a href=\"electrical%20resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt;, but also &lt;a href=\"capacitance\"&gt;capacitance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"inductance\"&gt;inductance&lt;/a&gt;, a delay in voltage and/or current at the load is apparent until the &lt;a href=\"Steady%20state%20theory\"&gt;steady state&lt;/a&gt; is reached. In a pure &lt;a href=\"RC%20circuit\"&gt;RC circuit&lt;/a&gt;, the output risetime (10% to 90%) is approximately equal to .\nAlternative definitions.\nOther definitions of rise time, apart from the one given by the &lt;a href=\"%23\"&gt;Federal Standard 1037C (1997&lt;/a&gt;, p. R-22) and its slight generalization given by , are occasionally used: these alternative definitions differ from the standard not only for the reference levels considered. For example, the time interval graphically corresponding to the intercept points of the tangent drawn through the 50% point of the step function response is occasionally used. Another definition, introduced by , uses concepts from &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"probability%20theory\"&gt;probability theory&lt;/a&gt;. Considering a &lt;a href=\"step%20response\"&gt;step response&lt;/a&gt; , he redefines the &lt;a href=\"Propagation%20delay%23Electronics\"&gt;delay time&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"first%20moment\"&gt;first moment&lt;/a&gt; of its &lt;a href=\"first%20derivative\"&gt;first derivative&lt;/a&gt; , i.e.\nFinally, he defines the rise time by using the second moment\nRise time of model systems.\nNotation.\nAll notations and assumptions required for the analysis are listed here.\nSimple examples of calculation of rise time.\nThe aim of this section is the calculation of rise time of &lt;a href=\"step%20response\"&gt;step response&lt;/a&gt; for some simple systems:\nGaussian response system.\nA system is said to have a \"&lt;a href=\"Gaussian\"&gt;Gaussian&lt;/a&gt; response\" if it is characterized by the following frequency response\nwhere is a constant, related to the high cutoff frequency by the following relation:\nEven if this kind frequency response is not realizable by a &lt;a href=\"causal%20filter\"&gt;causal filter&lt;/a&gt;, its usefulness lies in the fact that behaviour of a &lt;a href=\"cascade%20connection\"&gt;cascade connection&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Low-pass%20filter%23First%20order\"&gt;first order low pass filters&lt;/a&gt; approaches the behaviour of this system more closely as the number of cascaded stages &lt;a href=\"Asymptotic%20analysis\"&gt;asymptotically&lt;/a&gt; rises to &lt;a href=\"Countable%20set\"&gt;infinity&lt;/a&gt;. The corresponding &lt;a href=\"impulse%20response\"&gt;impulse response&lt;/a&gt; can be calculated using the inverse &lt;a href=\"Fourier%20transform\"&gt;Fourier transform&lt;/a&gt; of the shown &lt;a href=\"frequency%20response\"&gt;frequency response&lt;/a&gt;\nApplying directly the definition of &lt;a href=\"step%20response\"&gt;step response&lt;/a&gt;,\nTo determine the 10% to 90% rise time of the system it is necessary to solve for time the two following equations:\nBy using known properties of the &lt;a href=\"error%20function\"&gt;error function&lt;/a&gt;, the value is found: since ,\nand finally\nOne-stage low-pass RC network.\nFor a simple one-stage low-pass &lt;a href=\"RC%20circuit\"&gt;RC network&lt;/a&gt;, the 10% to 90% rise time is proportional to the network time constant :\nThe proportionality constant can be derived from the knowledge of the step response of the network to a &lt;a href=\"unit%20step%20function\"&gt;unit step function&lt;/a&gt; input signal of amplitude:\nSolving for time\nand finally,\nSince and are such that\nsolving these equations we find the analytical expression for and :\nThe rise time is therefore proportional to the time constant:\nNow, noting that\nthen\nand since the high frequency cutoff is equal to the bandwidth,\nFinally note that, if the 20% to 80% rise time is considered instead, becomes:\nOne-stage low-pass LR network.\nEven for a simple one-stage low-pass RL network, the 10% to 90% rise time is proportional to the network time constant . The formal proof of this assertion proceed exactly as shown in the previous section: the only difference between the final expressions for the rise time is due to the difference in the expressions for the time constant of the two different circuits, leading in the present case to the following result\nRise time of damped second order systems.\nAccording to , for underdamped systems used in control theory rise time is commonly defined as the time for a waveform to go from 0% to 100% of its final value: accordingly, the rise time from 0 to 100% of an underdamped 2nd-order system has the following form:\nThe &lt;a href=\"quadratic%20function\"&gt;quadratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"approximation\"&gt;approximation&lt;/a&gt; for normalized rise time for a 2nd-order system, &lt;a href=\"step%20response\"&gt;step response&lt;/a&gt;, no zeros is:\nwhere is the &lt;a href=\"damping%20ratio\"&gt;damping ratio&lt;/a&gt; and is the &lt;a href=\"natural%20frequency\"&gt;natural frequency&lt;/a&gt; of the network.\nRise time of cascaded blocks.\nConsider a system composed by cascaded non interacting blocks, each having a rise time , , and no &lt;a href=\"overshoot%20%28signal%29\"&gt;overshoot&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"step%20response\"&gt;step response&lt;/a&gt;: suppose also that the input signal of the first block has a rise time whose value is . Afterwards, its output signal has a rise time equal to\nAccording to , this result is a consequence of the &lt;a href=\"central%20limit%20theorem\"&gt;central limit theorem&lt;/a&gt; and was proved by : however, a detailed analysis of the problem is presented by , who also credit as the first one to prove the previous formula on a somewhat rigorous basis."
