    "text": "The Princess of the Stars is an experimental opera or &lt;a href=\"music%20drama\"&gt;music drama&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Canadians\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"R.%20Murray%20Schafer\"&gt;R. Murray Schafer&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; is notable because it must be performed around and on a lake, preferably as far from civilization as possible. The opera was premiered on a small lake outside &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; in 1981 by &lt;a href=\"New%20Music%20Concerts\"&gt;New Music Concerts&lt;/a&gt; and again in 1985 for the &lt;a href=\"Banff%20School%20of%20Fine%20Arts\"&gt;Banff School of Fine Arts&lt;/a&gt; summer festival on a more remote lake in &lt;a href=\"Banff%20National%20Park\"&gt;Banff National Park&lt;/a&gt;. The performance was attended by over five thousand people.\n\"The Princess of the Stars\", which has some basis in &lt;a href=\"Native%20American%20mythology\"&gt;Native American mythology&lt;/a&gt;, begins about one hour before dawn; timing is coordinated with early morning events such as birds beginning to sing and the sunrise. The &lt;a href=\"audience\"&gt;audience&lt;/a&gt; members are situated in a clearing at the water's edge. The &lt;a href=\"Conductor%20%28music%29\"&gt;conductor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"choir\"&gt;chorus&lt;/a&gt;, instrumentalists and the Princess herself are hidden from view around the edges of the lake. Other main characters and &lt;a href=\"dancer\"&gt;dancer&lt;/a&gt;s appear in &lt;a href=\"canoe\"&gt;canoe&lt;/a&gt;s on the lake. The work begins with a seven-minute &lt;a href=\"aria\"&gt;aria&lt;/a&gt; from the unseen Princess (a high &lt;a href=\"Soprano\"&gt;Soprano&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"aria\"&gt;aria&lt;/a&gt; makes use of &lt;a href=\"echo%20%28phenomenon%29\"&gt;echoes&lt;/a&gt; across the lake. As this aria ends canoes bearing &lt;a href=\"dancers\"&gt;dancers&lt;/a&gt; (The Dawn Birds) and &lt;a href=\"actor\"&gt;actor&lt;/a&gt;s in brightly colored &lt;a href=\"costumes\"&gt;costumes&lt;/a&gt; begin to appear from the far side of the lake. The characters of Wolf, Three-horned Enemy and Sun God are large, 7 to 18 feet high, lavishly decorated &lt;a href=\"puppets\"&gt;puppets&lt;/a&gt; mounted on long &lt;a href=\"war%20canoe\"&gt;war canoe&lt;/a&gt;s. Actors hidden within the puppets speak, sing or \"&lt;a href=\"sprechstimme\"&gt;sprechstimme&lt;/a&gt;\" the characters' parts. (Sun God's entrance is timed with the real &lt;a href=\"sunrise\"&gt;sunrise&lt;/a&gt;.) Throughout the work Schafer has written detailed instructions for the &lt;a href=\"performers\"&gt;performers&lt;/a&gt;. All the canoe routes are scripted and the participants chant in fictional languages created by Schafer.\n\"The Princess of the Stars\" is the &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt; in a series of twelve theatre pieces entitled \"&lt;a href=\"Patria%20%28theatre%29\"&gt;Patria&lt;/a&gt;\" (Latin for homeland).\nStory.\nThe story line of \"The Princess of the Stars\" is based, in part, on traditional tales told by various &lt;a href=\"Anishinaabe\"&gt;northeastern North American native peoples&lt;/a&gt;. In the opera, the Sun God\u2019s daughter, the Princess of the Stars, falls to the earth and is captured by Three Horned Enemy, who hides her at the bottom of a lake. Wolf, with the help of the Dawn Birds is determined to find the Princess. After an arduous search, Wolf finds the Princess in the lake and with the help of the Dawn Birds, who sweep the water aside with their wings, Wolf prepares to battle Three Horned Enemy. However, before the fight begins the sun emerges from the horizon and scares the Three Horned Enemy away. Sun God orders Wolf to search the world for the Princess (who has fled) and orders the Dawn Birds to freeze the lake and be silent until the Princess is found."
