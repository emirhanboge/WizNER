It is part of the 23-campus &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20University\"&gt;California State University&lt;/a&gt; (CSU) system. Cal State LA offers 142 &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt;s, 122 &lt;a href=\"master%27s%20degree\"&gt;master's degree&lt;/a&gt;s, and four &lt;a href=\"doctoral%20degree\"&gt;doctoral degree&lt;/a&gt;s: a &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Philosophy\"&gt;Doctor of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; (Ph.D.) in &lt;a href=\"special%20education\"&gt;special education&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; (UCLA), a &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Education\"&gt;Doctor of Education&lt;/a&gt; (Ed.D.) in Educational Leadership, a &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Nursing%20Practice\"&gt;Doctor of Nursing Practice&lt;/a&gt; (DNP) and a &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Audiology\"&gt;Doctor of Audiology&lt;/a&gt; (AuD). It also offers 22 &lt;a href=\"teaching%20credential\"&gt;teaching credential&lt;/a&gt;s. \nIn fall 2018, Cal State LA received the 5th-most applications of any CSU campus for incoming &lt;a href=\"freshmen\"&gt;freshmen&lt;/a&gt;, and had the 4th-lowest admission rate. Cal State LA has a student body of 26,342 as of fall 2020, which includes 22,566 &lt;a href=\"undergraduates\"&gt;undergraduates&lt;/a&gt;, primarily from the &lt;a href=\"greater%20Los%20Angeles%20area\"&gt;greater Los Angeles area&lt;/a&gt;, and 3,776 graduate students. While Cal State LA previously operated on the &lt;a href=\"Academic%20quarter%20%28year%20division%29\"&gt;quarter&lt;/a&gt; system, the university transitioned to the &lt;a href=\"semester\"&gt;semester&lt;/a&gt; system starting in fall 2016, with each academic year now consisting of two 15-week semesters. Cal State LA is organized into nine &lt;a href=\"Faculty%20%28division%29\"&gt;colleges&lt;/a&gt; that house a total of four &lt;a href=\"Faculty%20%28division%29\"&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt; and approximately 50 academic &lt;a href=\"Academic%20department\"&gt;departments&lt;/a&gt;, divisions and interdisciplinary programs, offering a variety of &lt;a href=\"academic%20major\"&gt;majors&lt;/a&gt;. The university\u2019s &lt;a href=\"forensic%20science\"&gt;forensic science&lt;/a&gt; program is one of the oldest in the nation. The &lt;a href=\"Early%20Entrance%20Program%20%28CSU%29\"&gt;Early Entrance Program&lt;/a&gt; (EEP) in the &lt;a href=\"Honors%20student\"&gt;Honors&lt;/a&gt; College for &lt;a href=\"gifted\"&gt;gifted&lt;/a&gt; students as young as 12 is the only one of its kind in the United States in promoting a direct transitional scheme from middle and high school to college without intermediary remedial education. Cal State LA is a &lt;a href=\"Hispanic-serving%20institution\"&gt;Hispanic-serving institution&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe hilltop campus core is home to the nation's first &lt;a href=\"Charter%20school\"&gt;Charter&lt;/a&gt; College of Education, the &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Brown\"&gt;Pat Brown&lt;/a&gt; Institute for Public Affairs, the Hertzberg-&lt;a href=\"Gray%20Davis\"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt; Forensic Science Center, the Hydrogen Research and Fueling Facility and the Luckman Fine Arts Complex.\nIt is also home to two high schools: the &lt;a href=\"Marc%20and%20Eva%20Stern%20Math%20and%20Science%20School\"&gt;Marc and Eva Stern Math and Science School&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County%20High%20School%20for%20the%20Arts\"&gt;Los Angeles County High School for the Arts&lt;/a&gt; (LACHSA), the only arts high school in Los Angeles that allows students from any district within Los Angeles County to attend.\nHistory.\nFirst half of 20th century.\nThe university is located on the site of one of California's 36 original &lt;a href=\"adobe\"&gt;adobe&lt;/a&gt;s, built in 1776 by &lt;a href=\"Franciscan\"&gt;Franciscan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"missionaries\"&gt;missionaries&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed by fire in 1908. When the &lt;a href=\"Spaniards\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; Franciscans founded the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20San%20Gabriel%20Arc%C3%A1ngel\"&gt;San Gabriel Mission&lt;/a&gt; in 1771, they dubbed the small river El Rio &lt;a href=\"Rosa%20%C3%97%20damascena\"&gt;Rosa de Castillo&lt;/a&gt;. These lands once were part of a &lt;a href=\"Ranchos%20of%20California\"&gt;Mexican land grant&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Rancho%20Rosa%20Castilla\"&gt;Rancho Rosa Castilla&lt;/a&gt;, given to Juan Batista Batz, a &lt;a href=\"Basque%20people\"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cowboy\"&gt;rancher&lt;/a&gt; from northern Spain and his wife, Catalina who settled here in the 1852. Batz used the land for farming and intensive sheep ranching. The inspiration for the name of the &lt;a href=\"ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt;, according to local historians, was the abundant amount of native wild &lt;a href=\"Rosa%20californica\"&gt;Wood roses (\"Rosa californica\")&lt;/a&gt; that grew near the ranch home along the &lt;a href=\"Creek%20%28tidal%29\"&gt;creek&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tongva%20people\"&gt;Tongva&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Indians&lt;/a&gt; named this area, \"Ochuunga\" (Place of Roses). The main &lt;a href=\"Driveway\"&gt;drive&lt;/a&gt; through the campus is known as Paseo Rancho Castilla, in acknowledgment of the university's historic heritage.\nCal State LA was founded on July 2, 1947, by an act of the California legislature and opened for classes as Los Angeles State College (LASC) on the campus of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20City%20College\"&gt;Los Angeles City College&lt;/a&gt; (LACC). LACC is a public &lt;a href=\"community%20college\"&gt;community college&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Hollywood\"&gt;East Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, Los Angeles located on &lt;a href=\"Vermont%20Avenue\"&gt;Vermont Avenue&lt;/a&gt; south of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Monica%20Boulevard\"&gt;Santa Monica Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; the former campus of UCLA and originally a farm outside Los Angeles. As president of LACC, P. Victor Peterson became the acting president of the state college. Since the college had opened in September, 1947, with 136 students, it had grown in two years to over 2,000 students. Most were studying under the &lt;a href=\"GI%20Bill\"&gt;GI Bill&lt;/a&gt;, which had been largely responsible for establishment of the college. The first class of seven students graduated in 1948.\nIn 1949, when Howard S. McDonald became president of both Los Angeles State College and Los Angeles City College, the state college upper division classes were being taught in borrowed spaces on the City College campus by mostly part-time faculty. He hired administrators to help him formally organize the colleges. Then he found a site within LA to house the new \"Los Angeles State College of Applied &lt;a href=\"Arts\"&gt;Arts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sciences\"&gt;Sciences&lt;/a&gt;\" (LASCAAS), which replaced the Los Angeles State College also in 1949 after being reconstituted by the Legislature. Howard S. McDonald enjoyed telling how some influential supporters of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20California\"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; (USC) opposed his selection of a piece of land in &lt;a href=\"Baldwin%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Baldwin Hills&lt;/a&gt;, and how the then Los Angeles Mayor &lt;a href=\"Norris%20Poulson\"&gt;Norris Poulson&lt;/a&gt; ran him out of &lt;a href=\"Chavez%20Ravine\"&gt;Chavez Ravine&lt;/a&gt; so that he could lure the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Dodger&lt;/a&gt; baseball team to Los Angeles. The college opened in its new location in 1958, Howard S. McDonald becomes first full-time president. When McDonald retired in 1962, seven academic buildings on the new campus were completed and an eighth structure (North Hall, later named King Hall) was nearing completion. North Hall opened in September 1962.\nSecond half of 20th century.\nIn 1952 the state proposed a new satellite campus for Cal State LA, at the time known as Los Angeles State College, and in July 1958, the campus separated from Cal State LA and was renamed San Fernando Valley State College (now known as &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20University%2C%20Northridge\"&gt;California State University, Northridge&lt;/a&gt;). The first &lt;a href=\"master%E2%80%99s\"&gt;master\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; degrees were awarded in 1952.\nSince 1954, Cal State LA has been accredited by the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Association%20of%20Schools%20and%20Colleges\"&gt;Western Association of Schools and Colleges&lt;/a&gt; (WASC). The university's credential programs are approved by the Commission for Teacher Credentialing Committee on Accreditation.\nIn 1955, officials broke ground on the current location, dubbed the Ramona site at the time. The college then moved to its present campus in the northeastern section of the City of Los Angeles, east of the &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Center%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Civic Center&lt;/a&gt;.\n1957 the first Cal State LA &lt;a href=\"time%20capsule\"&gt;time capsule&lt;/a&gt; is sealed in corner of Administration building (now Student Affairs) and a second Time capsule was buried during the Cal State LA 50th anniversary celebration September 1998.\nIn 1962 the college welcomed its third president Albert D. Graves who was vice president of Academic Affairs of LASCAAS. The college also entered into its first contract to prepare students for the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Peace%20Corps\"&gt;U.S. Peace Corps&lt;/a&gt;. The first group of 65 volunteers was trained for service in the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Republic\"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt; in the areas of teacher training, music teacher training and urban community action. The first &lt;a href=\"Graduation\"&gt;Commencement&lt;/a&gt; at new site takes place in June 1963.\nOn December 6, 1963, the California State College (now California State University) &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20directors\"&gt;Board of Trustees&lt;/a&gt; named the library after the late 35th &lt;a href=\"president%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;president of the United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. An edifice plaque was unveiled during the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library naming ceremony on February 12, 1964, and in November 1969 the library North Wing is dedicated.\nIn 1964, the Board of Trustees of the California State Colleges changed the name of the college to the \"California State College at Los Angeles\" (CSCLA), and in 1968 to \"California State College, Los Angeles\", when it became part of the California State College (CSC) system. In 1972, CSCLA was awarded university status and was renamed California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA).\nIn 1968 Cal State LA established the nation's first &lt;a href=\"Chicano%20Studies\"&gt;Chicano Studies&lt;/a&gt; department.\nIn fall 1970 the South Tower and South Hall were completed and opened. July 1976 the CSU Board of Trustees approved the renaming of South Tower to Simpson Tower, in memory of Floyd R. Simpson, first &lt;a href=\"Dean%20%28education%29\"&gt;dean&lt;/a&gt; of the School of Business and Economics. South Hall was renamed Salazar Hall in memory of slain &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Times\"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"journalist\"&gt;journalist&lt;/a&gt; and news director for &lt;a href=\"KMEX-DT\"&gt;KMEX-DT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ruben%20Salazar\"&gt;Ruben Salazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe original mascot of the school was the &lt;a href=\"Devil\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. In 1980, new university president James Rosser adopted a new mascot, Eddie the &lt;a href=\"golden%20eagle\"&gt;golden eagle&lt;/a&gt;, designed to be more reflective of the campus' highly diverse community. The theme was extended to student facilities such as the student union and bookstore.\nA Statue of &lt;a href=\"Confucius\"&gt;Confucius&lt;/a&gt;, a gift of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; in Taiwan, was dedicated June 1987. The statue was moved to a new campus location in summer 2005. Its home is now on the grassy area, south of the State Playhouse.\nIn 1993, the California State University (CSU) &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20%28education%29\"&gt;Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; and Trustees approved development of Cal State LA's Charter College of Education, creating the first such college of higher education in the nation.\nIn October 1998, the Center for Environmental Analysis (CEA-CREST), first of its kind funded by the National Science Foundation on the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;West Coast&lt;/a&gt;, opened on campus.\n21st century.\nIn September 2000, &lt;a href=\"California%20Governor\"&gt;California Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Davis\"&gt;Gray Davis&lt;/a&gt; chose the Cal State LA campus to hold a press conference at which he signed the historic bills expanding the &lt;a href=\"Cal%20Grant\"&gt;Cal Grant&lt;/a&gt; program.\nCal State LA departments of Social Work and Nursing, located within the university\u2019s College of Health and Human Services, were granted the status of School in Winter 2002.\nCal State LA Downtown is a satellite campus opened in January 2016. Programs are provided through the university's College of Professional &amp; Global Education.\nNaming of the Rongxiang Xu College of Health and Human Services took place during the university's 69th Commencement on June 11, 2016. The naming recognized the largest gift in the university's history and named in honor of the late Dr. Rongxiang Xu, who was a &lt;a href=\"surgeon\"&gt;surgeon&lt;/a&gt; and expert in &lt;a href=\"regenerative%20medicine\"&gt;regenerative medicine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Patricia A. Chin School of Nursing was dedicated as the first named school at Cal State L.A. in April 2018. Patricia Chin taught nursing at the university, later serving as director and, upon her retirement, professor emerita.\nCampus life and cost of university.\nAs of the fall of 2016, Cal State LA switched over from the quarter to the semester system.

ASI is governed by a student board of directors who are elected each year by the student body of Cal State LA. ASI represents the interests of the student body and acts as the officially recognized voice of the students. In addition, ASI sponsors a number of campus events and activities using mandatory student fees.\nEagle Advocates a.k.a.

A focus is aimed at the state legislature although local and federal issues are followed as well.\nStudent housing.\nFrom 1964 to 1972, developer &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Lesser\"&gt;Louis Lesser&lt;/a&gt; built six off-campus, 10-story high-rise residential halls to house 3,600 students. The campus lacked space for horizontal expansion, following the California State University expansion plan started in 1959. This doubled the university's housing capacity, making Cal State LA the largest in the &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20University\"&gt;California State University&lt;/a&gt; system. &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Starkman\"&gt;Maxwell Starkman&lt;/a&gt; &amp; Associates, AIA, of Beverly Hills, designed the development plan. Unlike other components of the Cal State University system being developed in the 1960s, the residence halls were privately financed by &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Lesser%20Enterprises%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Louis Lesser Enterprises, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; The first residential life complex phase I on-campus housing was opened in June 1984, and three years later, a second residential life complex Phase II was opened. Cal State LA has a student-housing complex where students can rent a house at double occupancy for $655.00 per month (as of November 2009). During &lt;a href=\"1984%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1984 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; that took place in Los Angeles, Cal State LA student houses were upgraded and expanded because it housed the athletics of the 1984 Summer Olympics.\nLesser also pioneered &lt;a href=\"underground%20parking\"&gt;underground parking&lt;/a&gt;, with his Cal State LA development, at the time considered unusual enough to merit a separate newspaper section header, \"Parking Underground\", which described a two-level underground parking lot as a \"concept\" of \"subterranean spaces\".\nThe new housing expansion the Golden Eagle Apartments (GEA) for Graduate and Upper-Division Students are located one block north of campus. The Student Housing East project is scheduled for completion in fall 2021.\nThemed-living communities.\nResident Scholars Housing\nThe goal of Resident Scholars Housing is to provide Cal State LA Honors College and academically achieving students with themed housing that supports the mission and vision of the Honors College and the Institutional Learning Outcomes by forming a strong community of students through shared Honors classes, providing learning opportunities and social engagement beyond the classroom and engaging in a student-directed community. It also increases the following: student interaction with Honors faculty, staff and fellow students; involvement in the larger Los Angeles and Cal State LA community; and retention and graduation rates.\nGender Inclusive Housing\nGender Inclusive Housing is for students interested in living with people of all gender identities and expressions. The Cal State LA Housing and Residence Life community defines Gender Inclusive Housing as an environment where students may choose to share a room with any other student regardless of sex, biological gender, gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation.\nHalisi Scholars Living Learning Community\nThe Halisi Scholars Living Learning Community is designed to enhance the residential experience for students who are a part of or interested in issues regarding the Black community living on campus by offering the opportunity to connect with faculty and peers, and engage in programs that focus on academic success, cultural awareness and civic engagement.\nParking and public transportation.\nCal State LA's parking received press coverage for pioneering the concept of underground parking to deal with the limitations of ground space for expansion under the initial California State expansion plans of the early 1960s. Developer &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Lesser\"&gt;Louis Lesser&lt;/a&gt; developed \"&lt;a href=\"underground%20parking\"&gt;underground parking&lt;/a&gt;\u201d in his off campus residential housing development for the university in 1964, with only a two level underground parking structure considered so unusual as to merit a separate newspaper section header, \"Parking Underground\", and calling the parking \u201csubterranean spaces.\"\nStructure E, a 5-story open parking garage provides over 2,000 parking spaces and hosts &lt;a href=\"electric%20vehicle\"&gt;electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (EV) charging stations, including 3 fast chargers for the Cal State LA community. Structure E is accessible to the upper level of campus through the existing Structure C in Lot 5. The &lt;a href=\"Photovoltaic%20system\"&gt;Solar PV&lt;/a&gt; System installed atop Structure E generates 1 megawatt (MW) of renewable energy.\nThe school is home to the first commuter &lt;a href=\"Rail%20transport\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; station on a college campus, the &lt;a href=\"Cal%20State%20L.A.%20%28Metrolink%20station%29\"&gt;station of the same name&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Metrolink%20%28Southern%20California%29\"&gt;Metrolink's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Metrolink%20San%20Bernardino%20Line\"&gt;San Bernardino Line&lt;/a&gt;, which opened in October 1994. The school is also accessible from the &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20University%2C%20Los%20Angeles%20%28LACMTA%20station%29\"&gt;namesake station&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"El%20Monte%20Busway\"&gt;El Monte Busway&lt;/a&gt;; both stations are located at the south end of the campus. &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Local\"&gt;Metro Local&lt;/a&gt; lines 106, 256, 258 &amp; 665, as well as neighborhood shuttles serve the school.\nConstruction is completed on a &lt;a href=\"Hydrogen%20station\"&gt;hydrogen fueling station&lt;/a&gt; on campus. The station will operate as a teaching resource for classes on &lt;a href=\"alternative%20energy\"&gt;alternative energy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fuel%20tank\"&gt;fuel system&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as a public accommodation selling and dispensing hydrogen to those driving &lt;a href=\"fuel%20cell\"&gt;fuel cell&lt;/a&gt; vehicles. Cal State LA is one of only three organizations in the state to be awarded CARB funding for such a facility.\nOrganization and administration.\nCal State LA is one of 23 campuses in the &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20University%20system\"&gt;California State University system&lt;/a&gt;. The CSU system is administered by a 25-member board of trustees, which adopts regulations and policies governing the entire system.
