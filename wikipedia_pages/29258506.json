    "text": "Bourke Street is a &lt;a href=\"1886%20in%20art\"&gt;1886&lt;/a&gt; painting by Australian artist &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Roberts\"&gt;Tom Roberts&lt;/a&gt;. Roberts originally titled the work Allegro con brio. The painting depicts the western end of &lt;a href=\"Bourke%20Street%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Bourke Street&lt;/a&gt;, one of the main thoroughfares in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; as seen from the &lt;a href=\"Buckley%20%26amp%3B%20Nunn\"&gt;Buckley &amp; Nunn&lt;/a&gt; drapery.\nThe work was painted a few months after Roberts' return to Australia in 1885, after he had spent four years in Europe . It was not displayed until 1890, and only five days beforehand, Roberts added three female figures to the lower left. Roberts was unable to find a buyer and handed the painting to fellow artist, &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20McCubbin\"&gt;Frederick McCubbin&lt;/a&gt;. In 1920, McCubbin's widow sold the painting to the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Parliamentary%20Library\"&gt;Commonwealth Parliamentary Library&lt;/a&gt; for 20 &lt;a href=\"Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29\"&gt;guineas&lt;/a&gt;\u2014forwarding the proceeds to Roberts, who was in London at the time."
