Deployed as an &lt;a href=\"attacking%20midfielder\"&gt;attacking midfielder&lt;/a&gt;, Hagi was considered one of the best players in the world during the 1980s and '90s, and is regarded by many as the greatest Romanian footballer of all time. Fans of Turkish club &lt;a href=\"Galatasaray%20S.K.%20%28football%29\"&gt;Galatasaray&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Hagi ended his career, called him \"Comandante\" (\"The Commander\"), while he was known as \"Regele\" (\"The King\") to Romanian supporters. Nicknamed \"The &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Maradona\"&gt;Maradona&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Carpathian%20Mountains\"&gt;Carpathians&lt;/a&gt;\", he was a creative advanced &lt;a href=\"playmaker\"&gt;playmaker&lt;/a&gt; renowned for his dribbling, technique, vision, passing and shooting.\nAfter starting his playing career in Romania, with &lt;a href=\"FC%20Farul%20Constan%C8%9Ba\"&gt;Farul Constan\u021ba&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently featuring for &lt;a href=\"FC%20Sportul%20Studen%C8%9Besc%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Sportul Studen\u021besc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Steaua Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, he later also had spells in Spain with &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20CF\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, Italy with &lt;a href=\"Brescia%20Calcio\"&gt;Brescia&lt;/a&gt;, and Turkey, with Galatasaray; as such, Hagi is one of the few footballers to have played for both Spanish rival clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona.

He was named &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Romanian Footballer of the Year&lt;/a&gt; a record seven times, and is regarded as one of the best football players of his generation. Hagi was nominated six times for the &lt;a href=\"Ballon%20d%27Or\"&gt;Ballon d'Or&lt;/a&gt;, his best performance being a 4th place in &lt;a href=\"1994%20Ballon%20d%27Or\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;. In November 2003, to celebrate &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt;'s Jubilee, Hagi was selected as the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Jubilee%20Awards\"&gt;Golden Player&lt;/a&gt; of Romania by the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Romanian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. In 2004, he was named by &lt;a href=\"Pel%C3%A9\"&gt;Pel\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; as one of the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20100\"&gt;125 Greatest Living Footballers&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; Awards Ceremony.

In 2009, he founded Romanian club Viitorul Constan\u021ba, which he has coached between 2014 and 2020. Hagi also established his &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Hagi%20Football%20Academy\"&gt;namesake football academy&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest ones in &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Europe\"&gt;Southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nHagi started his career playing for the youth teams of &lt;a href=\"SSC%20Farul%20Constan%C8%9Ba\"&gt;FC Constan\u021ba&lt;/a&gt; under the guidance of coach &lt;a href=\"Iosif%20B%C3%BCk%C3%B6ssy\"&gt;Iosif B\u00fck\u00f6ssy&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s. He was selected by the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Romanian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; to join the squad of Luceaf\u0103rul Bucure\u0219ti in 1980, where he remained for two years. In 1982, he returned to &lt;a href=\"SSC%20Farul%20Constan%C8%9Ba\"&gt;FC Constan\u021ba&lt;/a&gt;, making his &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Divizia A&lt;/a&gt; debut under coach &lt;a href=\"Emanoil%20Ha%C8%99oti\"&gt;Emanoil Ha\u0219oti&lt;/a&gt; in a 3\u20130 loss against &lt;a href=\"FCM%20Bac%C4%83u\"&gt;SC Bac\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;, but one year later, aged 18, he was prepared to make the step up to play for a top team. He was originally directed to &lt;a href=\"CS%20Universitatea%20Craiova\"&gt;Universitatea Craiova&lt;/a&gt;, but chose &lt;a href=\"FC%20Sportul%20Studen%C8%9Besc%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Sportul Studen\u021besc&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nIn late 1986, Hagi transferred to &lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Steaua Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; as the team prepared for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;European Super Cup&lt;/a&gt; final against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv\"&gt;Dynamo Kyiv&lt;/a&gt;. The original contract was for a one-game loan only, the &lt;a href=\"1986%20European%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;. However, after winning the trophy, in which Hagi scored the only goal of the match from a free kick, Steaua did not want to release him back to Sportul Studen\u021besc and retained him. During his Steaua years (1987\u20131990), Hagi played 97 &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Liga I&lt;/a&gt; games, scoring 76 goals, and netted 98 goals in total in 107 appearances for the club across all competitions. With the club, he reached the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-final in &lt;a href=\"1987%E2%80%9388%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"1989%20European%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; in the following year, while Hagi finished as one of the competition's top scorers in the former edition of the tournament.&lt;ref name=\"Champions Cup/Champions League Topscorers\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hagi also won three consecutive league and &lt;a href=\"Cupa%20Rom%C3%A2niei\"&gt;Cup&lt;/a&gt; doubles with Steaua between 1987 and 1989. His strong performances had him linked with &lt;a href=\"Arrigo%20Sacchi\"&gt;Arrigo Sacchi&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;, fellow Serie A club &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;, and German side &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Ceau%C8%99escu\"&gt;Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Romania\"&gt;communist government&lt;/a&gt; rejected any offer.\nAfter impressing at the &lt;a href=\"1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1990 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Hagi was signed by Spanish club &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20CF\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; on 27 June that same year; the &lt;a href=\"La%20Liga\"&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt; side paid $3.5\u00a0million to Steaua Bucure\u0219ti in order to acquire him. Hagi played two seasons with Real Madrid, which were largely unsuccessful, scoring 20 goals in 84 games, and only winning the &lt;a href=\"1990%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a\"&gt;Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;; some of his most memorable performances for the club included a hat-trick in a 5\u20130 home win over &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Bilbao\"&gt;Athletic Bilbao&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium\"&gt;Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, on match-day 22 of the &lt;a href=\"1991%E2%80%9392%20La%20Liga\"&gt;1991\u201392 season&lt;/a&gt;, and a 40-yard lob against &lt;a href=\"CA%20Osasuna\"&gt;Osasuna&lt;/a&gt; during the same campaign. He was subsequently sold to Italian side &lt;a href=\"Brescia%20Calcio\"&gt;Brescia&lt;/a&gt; for 8 billion lira in 1992.\nHagi began the &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1992\u201393 season&lt;/a&gt; with Brescia in Serie A, but after his first season, the club was relegated to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt;. The following season, Hagi helped the club win the &lt;a href=\"1993%E2%80%9394%20Anglo-Italian%20Cup\"&gt;Anglo-Italian Cup&lt;/a&gt;, with Brescia defeating &lt;a href=\"Notts%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Notts County&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the final at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt;, and also helped the team finish third in &lt;a href=\"1993%E2%80%9394%20Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; and earn promotion back to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;. After performing memorably during the &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Hagi returned to Spain, and was signed by defending La Liga champions &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a32 million, where he immediately won his second &lt;a href=\"1994%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a\"&gt;Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; title; however, he later struggled to gain playing time at the club under manager &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Cruyff\"&gt;Johan Cruyff&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter two years at \"Bar\u00e7a\", Hagi signed for Turkish club &lt;a href=\"Galatasaray%20S.K.%20%28football%29\"&gt;Galatasaray&lt;/a&gt; in 1996, at the age of 31. He had been the subject of a competing transfer offer from &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20FC\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo FC&lt;/a&gt;. Although in the twilight of his career, at Galatasaray, he was extremely successful, and became highly popular among the Turkish supporters, due to his excellent performances for the club. Hagi was an important member of the Galatasaray team that went on to win four consecutive league titles between 1996 and 2000. In 2000, at age 35, Hagi had one of the best seasons of his career, winning every possible major title with Galatasaray that season. Most significantly, Hagi &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;captained&lt;/a&gt; the club to win the &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; after defeating &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; on penalties in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;, following a 0\u20130 draw; during the match, Hagi was sent off in extra-time for punching Arsenal captain &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Adams\"&gt;Tony Adams&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, Galatasaray became the first Turkish club to win a &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20club%20competitions\"&gt;UEFA club competition&lt;/a&gt; title. The team's UEFA Cup triumph was immediately followed by the &lt;a href=\"2000%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Super Cup&lt;/a&gt; title, with a historic 2\u20131 win against Hagi's former club Real Madrid in extra-time. The mass hysteria caused by these wins in &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; raised Hagi's popularity with the fans even further, and prompted &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;former France international&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fern%C3%A1ndez\"&gt;Luis Fern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt; to say, \"Hagi is like wine, the older it gets, the better it is.\"\nWhen he retired in 2001, Hagi was one of the most popular players in both Turkey and Romania. Hagi drew praise from the Galatasaray supporters for his performances during his time with the club, who adopted the chant \"I Love You Hagi\" in his honour. While coaching Galatasaray in 2004, he briefly came out of retirement to play in the testimonial game for his former teammate &lt;a href=\"Suat%20Kaya\"&gt;Suat Kaya&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Turkey%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Turkey XI&lt;/a&gt;. Hagi played the first half wearing his iconic shirt number 10 and helped Galatasaray win 2\u20131.\nInternational career.\nGheorghe Hagi made his debut for &lt;a href=\"Romania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; on 10 August 1983 at the age of 18, under coach &lt;a href=\"Mircea%20Lucescu\"&gt;Mircea Lucescu&lt;/a&gt; who used him in all the minutes of friendly which ended 0\u20130 against &lt;a href=\"Norway%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, played on the &lt;a href=\"Ullevaal%20Stadion\"&gt;Ullevaal stadium&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;. He scored his first international goal against &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in 1984. The following year, he was made captain for the first time, in a &lt;a href=\"1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29\"&gt;World Cup qualifier&lt;/a&gt; against the same opponent.\nAlthough Romania failed to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1986 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Hagi later took part at the 1990 World Cup, where he helped the team reach the round of 16, before &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; ended their run, after winning the resulting penalty shoot-out following a 0\u20130 draw, with Hagi netting Romania's first spot kick. Four years later, he led the Romanian team to its best ever international performance at the 1994 World Cup, as they reached the quarter-finals, only to lose to &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; in a penalty shoot-out once again. Hagi scored three times in the tournament, including a memorable goal in their 3\u20132 surprise defeat of South American powerhouse and previous runners-up &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. In the first of Romania's group stage matches, a 3\u20131 win against &lt;a href=\"Colombia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, Hagi provided two assists and scored one of the most memorable goals of the tournament, curling in a 40-yard lob over Colombian goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"%C3%93scar%20C%C3%B3rdoba\"&gt;\u00d3scar C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt; who was caught out of position; the goal was later voted the fifth greatest World Cup goal in a FIFAworldcup.com poll. Hagi was named in the Team of the Tournament for his performances.\nFour years later, he captained Romania at the &lt;a href=\"1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1998 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;; Hagi initially communicated that France '98 would be his final tournament. Romania topped their group, which featured &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, Colombia, and &lt;a href=\"Tunisia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;, and reached the round of 16, before being eliminated by &lt;a href=\"Croatia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;. After the tournament, Hagi retired from the national team, only to change his mind after a few months and participate in &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202000\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2000&lt;/a&gt;, during which he was &lt;a href=\"sent%20off\"&gt;sent off&lt;/a&gt; in the 2\u20130 quarter-final loss against &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202000%20Final\"&gt;eventual runners-up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;; this was his final international appearance.\nHagi retired from professional football in 2001, at the age of 36; that year, he was given a send-off in a testimonial game on 24 April, called \"Gala Hagi,\" featuring a team of Romanian All-Stars against a team of international All-Stars. At the time of his retirement, his 124 caps for his country were a national record, which has since been surpassed by Dorinel Munteanu. He currently still holds the record of most goals scored for the Romanian national team, alongside Adrian Mutu, with 35.\nCareer as coach.\nRomania national team.\nIn 2001, Hagi was named the manager of the Romania national team, replacing &lt;a href=\"Ladislau%20B%C3%B6l%C3%B6ni\"&gt;Ladislau B\u00f6l\u00f6ni&lt;/a&gt;, who left the squad to coach &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Sporting Clube de Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. After failing to qualify the team for the &lt;a href=\"2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, however, Hagi was sacked. His only notable achievement during the six months as Romania's manager was the win in &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;.\nBursaspor.\nIn 2003, Hagi took over as coach of Turkish &lt;a href=\"S%C3%BCper%20Lig\"&gt;S\u00fcper Lig&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Bursaspor\"&gt;Bursaspor&lt;/a&gt;, but left the club after a disappointing start to the season.\nGalatasaray.\nHagi then became manager of Galatasaray in 2004, leading the team to the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Cup\"&gt;Turkish Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2005%20Turkish%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2005 final&lt;/a&gt; with 5\u20131 as a score against &lt;a href=\"Fenerbah%C3%A7e%E2%80%93Galatasaray%20rivalry\"&gt;fierce rivals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fenerbah%C3%A7e%20S.K.%20%28football%29\"&gt;Fenerbah\u00e7e&lt;/a&gt;. His contract, however, was not renewed since his team was not able to win &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20S%C3%BCper%20Lig\"&gt;2004\u201305 S\u00fcper Lig&lt;/a&gt; title over Fenerbah\u00e7e during the &lt;a href=\"centennial\"&gt;centennial&lt;/a&gt; of the club.\nPolitehnica Timi\u0219oara.\nSteaua Bucure\u0219ti sought to hire Hagi in the summer of 2005, but Hagi's requested wage could not be met by the Romanian champions, and he became manager of &lt;a href=\"FC%20Politehnica%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;Politehnica Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; instead. However, after a string of poor results and disagreements with management, he left the club after a few months. Constan\u021ba's &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Farul\"&gt;main stadium&lt;/a&gt; used to bear his name, but the name was changed after Hagi signed with Politehnica Timi\u0219oara.\nSteaua Bucure\u0219ti.\nFrom June to September 2007, Hagi coached &lt;a href=\"FCSB\"&gt;Steaua Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, had a mediocre start in the internal championship mainly due to the large number of unavailable injured players, and managed to qualify the team for the second time in line to the UEFA Champions League group stages, passing two qualifying rounds. He resigned due to a long series of conflicts with club owner &lt;a href=\"Gigi%20Becali\"&gt;Gigi Becali&lt;/a&gt;, which also happens to be his godson. The main reason for resigning was the owner's policy of imposing players, making the team's strategy and threats.

His official presentation was held on 22 October. His former teammate from Galatasaray &lt;a href=\"Tugay%20Kerimo%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Tugay Kerimo\u011flu&lt;/a&gt; assisted him in &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, but he was sacked on 22 March 2011 after a series of poor results in the S\u00fcper Lig.\nViitorul Constan\u021ba.\nIn September 2014, Hagi appointed himself manager of &lt;a href=\"Viitorul%20Constan%C8%9Ba\"&gt;Viitorul Constan\u021ba&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to being the owner and chairman of the club. Successfully avoiding relegation in his first season, Viitorul went on to be the season's wonder in the &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2015\u201316&lt;/a&gt; season, finishing the first half of the regular season on 3rd place, which led Hagi to be named &lt;a href=\"Romania%20Coach%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Romania Coach of the Year&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Viitorul finished the regular season on 4th place, earning their first play-off qualification. Viitorul finished the play-off on 5th place, but qualified for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt; third qualifying round due to &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;'s insolvency. In their first European match, Viitorul were defeated 0\u20135 by &lt;a href=\"KAA%20Gent\"&gt;Gent&lt;/a&gt; at the Ghelamco Arena, and were eliminated after a 0\u20130 home draw.\nViitorul won their maiden league title, being &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2016\u201317 Liga I&lt;/a&gt; champions after a 1\u20130 home victory over CFR Cluj; they finished the play-off with 44 points, same as &lt;a href=\"FCSB\"&gt;FCSB&lt;/a&gt;, but on a better head-to-head record after a 3\u20131 home victory over FCSB. As a result, Hagi won his second Romania Coach of the Year award.\nStyle of play.\nA talented left-footed &lt;a href=\"attacking%20midfielder\"&gt;attacking midfielder&lt;/a&gt;, Hagi's playing style was frequently &lt;a href=\"New%20Maradona\"&gt;compared&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Maradona\"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt;'s throughout his career, due to his technical ability as well as his temperamental character and leadership; as a youth, he was mainly inspired by compatriots &lt;a href=\"Anghel%20Iord%C4%83nescu\"&gt;Anghel Iord\u0103nescu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Dumitru\"&gt;Ion Dumitru&lt;/a&gt;. A quick, highly creative, and mobile advanced &lt;a href=\"playmaker\"&gt;playmaker&lt;/a&gt;, Hagi was also tactically versatile, and capable of playing in several &lt;a href=\"Midfielder\"&gt;midfield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;offensive&lt;/a&gt; positions on either &lt;a href=\"Midfielder%23Winger\"&gt;wing&lt;/a&gt; or through the &lt;a href=\"Midfielder%23Central%20midfielder\"&gt;middle&lt;/a&gt;, due to his ability with both feet, despite being naturally left-footed, although he had a preference for using his stronger foot; his preferred position was in a free role as a classic number 10, but he was also used as a &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Second%20striker\"&gt;second striker&lt;/a&gt; on occasion. Hagi was renowned in particular for his first touch and speed on the ball, as well as his timing, interpretation of space, bursts of acceleration, and &lt;a href=\"Dribbling%23Association%20football\"&gt;dribbling&lt;/a&gt; skills, which enabled him to get past defenders; he was also highly regarded for his vision and precise passing, although he was capable of both scoring and assisting goals, and was also an accurate finisher and &lt;a href=\"Direct%20free%20kick\"&gt;set-piece&lt;/a&gt; taker, who had a penchant for scoring goals from powerful, &lt;a href=\"Curl%20%28football%29\"&gt;bending&lt;/a&gt; long range strikes. Despite his small stature and slender build, Hagi possessed significant upper body strength, which, along with his control, aided him in protecting the ball from opponents, and allowed him to create space for himself or his teammates. Despite his skill and his reputation as one of the greatest &lt;a href=\"Squad%20number%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;number 10s&lt;/a&gt; of his generation, his career was marked by inconsistency at times, and he was also considered to be a controversial player, due to his rebellious and arrogant attitude, as well as his low work-rate, aggression, unsportsmanlike behaviour, and lack of discipline, which led him to have several disagreements and confrontations with his managers, opponents, and officials.\nPersonal life.\nGheorghe Hagi was born to Chirata Hagi, his mother, and Iancu Hagi, his father.
