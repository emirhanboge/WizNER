    "text": "The German trained divisions (, literally German-equipped divisions) were the elite-quality, best trained and equipped infantry &lt;a href=\"division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20%281912-1949%29\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"National%20Revolutionary%20Army\"&gt;National Revolutionary Army&lt;/a&gt; trained under &lt;a href=\"Sino-German%20cooperation%20%281926%E2%80%931941%29\"&gt;Sino-German cooperation from 1926 to 1941&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;President of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. These divisions were active in the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Chinese Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War\"&gt;Second Sino-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn 1927, after the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"First%20United%20Front%20%28China%29\"&gt;First United Front&lt;/a&gt; between the Nationalists and the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20China\"&gt;Communists&lt;/a&gt;, the ruling &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; (KMT, or the Chinese Nationalist Party) purged its leftist members and largely eliminated Soviet influence from its ranks. &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt; then turned to Germany, historically a great military power, for the reorganisation and modernisation of the NRA.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Weimar%20Republic\"&gt;Weimar Republic&lt;/a&gt; sent advisors to the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20%281912-1949%29\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, but because of the restrictions imposed by the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt;, they could not serve in military capacities. Chiang initially requested famous generals such as &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"August%20von%20Mackensen\"&gt;von Mackensen&lt;/a&gt; as advisors - the Weimar Republic turned him down, fearing that they were too famous, would invite the ire of the Allies, and would result in the loss of national prestige for such renowned figures to work, essentially, as &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Max%20Bauer\"&gt;Max Bauer&lt;/a&gt; was the first advisor sent to China. \nWhen &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt; became the &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Chancellor of Germany&lt;/a&gt; in 1933 and disregarded the Treaty, the anti-communist &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Party\"&gt;Nazi Party&lt;/a&gt; and the anti-communist KMT were soon engaged in cooperation with Germany training Chinese troops and expanding Chinese infrastructure, while China opened its markets and natural resources to Germany.\nIn 1934 General &lt;a href=\"Hans%20von%20Seeckt\"&gt;Hans von Seeckt&lt;/a&gt;, acting as advisor to President Chiang, proposed a \"80 Division Plan\" for reforming the entire Chinese army into 80 divisions of highly trained, well-equipped troops organised along German lines. The plan was never fully realised, as the vying &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Era\"&gt;warlords&lt;/a&gt; could not agree upon the reorganised division organization and the disbanding of the others. By July 1937 only 8 infantry divisions had completed reorganisation and training. These were the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28National%20Revolutionary%20Army%29\"&gt;3rd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"6th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28National%20Revolutionary%20Army%29\"&gt;6th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"9th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28National%20Revolutionary%20Army%29\"&gt;9th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"14th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28National%20Revolutionary%20Army%29\"&gt;14th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"36th%20Division%20%28National%20Revolutionary%20Army%29\"&gt;36th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"87th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28National%20Revolutionary%20Army%29\"&gt;87th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"88th%20Division%20%28National%20Revolutionary%20Army%29\"&gt;88th&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Division%20%28National%20Revolutionary%20Army%29\"&gt;Training Division&lt;/a&gt;. \nAnother 12 divisions equipped with Chinese arms on the reorganized model with German advisors had some training by the time the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War\"&gt;Second Sino-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt; started in July 1937. These Divisions were the 2nd, 4th, 10th, 11th, 25th, 27th, 57th, 67th, 80th, 83rd, 89th Infantry Divisions. \nStructure of proposed division.\nReorganized Division organization: Was to be composed of approximately 14,000 personnel organized in to:\nEach Division was to have two Home Regiments to provide trained Infantry replacements."
