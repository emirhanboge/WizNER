He became an international referee and the 66th &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Scottish Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt;. He had a distinguished military career with the Gordon Highlanders in the First World War.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe played for &lt;a href=\"Watsonian%20FC\"&gt;Watsonians&lt;/a&gt;.

He refereed the Wales versus England match in the &lt;a href=\"1932%20Home%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;1932 Home Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoaching career.\nHe organised his own representative side, the Frank Moffat XV. His side would play Watsonians every year around New Year. He very often picked players from north-east Scotland in his team. His side accrued a lot of status and the Frank Moffat XV versus Watsonians match was almost treated as another trial match by the Scotland selectors.\nAdministrative career.\nDuring the Second World War Moffat was the convenor of the Scottish Commnad Rugby Football Committee.\nHe was a member of the SRU selection committee for many years.\nHe was Vice-President of the SRU in 1951.\nHe was &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Scottish Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; for the period 1952 to 1953.\nMilitary career.\nHe was a Lieutenant Colonel of the Gordon Highlanders and a member of the Royal Company of Archers.\nMoffat won the Distinguished Service Order in 1917 for his service with the 8/10th battalion in the Battle of Ypres.\nThe citation reads:\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in an attack. He was in command of the right attacking company, which was opposed to a powerful system of the enemy\u2019s defences. He led his company forward with the greatest courage and determination under heavy fire, but they were eventually held up by a machine-gun firing from a concrete emplacement. This he attacked single-handed, putting all the team out of action. He was badly wounded during this encounter, but, inspiring his men to further efforts, he led them several hundred yards further before he fell exhausted. His splendid courage and determination were undoubtedly responsible for the success of the attack.\nThe Gordon Highlanders Museum in Aberdeen features the 'Moffat Trench' - a replica First World War trench - which is named after him.\nAs an archer Moffat won the Montrose Silver Arrow competition twice; in 1954 and in 1959 after a play-off.\nOutside of rugby union and military.\nHe studied medicine at Edinburgh University but as war broke in 1914 he joined the Gordon Highlanders and never returned to medicine.\nHe played cricket for Watsonians.\nHe was a mining engineer by trade. In 1947 he was appointed Estates Mining Engineer for the Scottish division of the National Coal Board.\nHe died in hospital in 1978 after a stroke. His death was at the end of March that year."
