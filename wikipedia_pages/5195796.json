People can trade in these exchanges remotely using &lt;a href=\"electronic%20trading\"&gt;electronic trading&lt;/a&gt; platforms. For those trading in different parts of the world, there are unique trading days based on the hours associated with any given time zone. For example, NASDAQ is open 9:30-16:00 ET and anyone outside of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;Eastern Time Zone&lt;/a&gt; will have a different trading day (for example, in Vancouver a trading day would run from 6:30-13:00). During the part of the year when North America is on standard time, in it would be 17:30-24:00 in Moscow, and in Shanghai it would be 22:30-5:00. Remote traders should find their trading hours based on the stock exchange's hours and time zone."
