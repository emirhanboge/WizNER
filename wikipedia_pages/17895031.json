    "text": "Morrison's Haven is a &lt;a href=\"harbour\"&gt;harbour&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Prestongrange\"&gt;Prestongrange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Lothian\"&gt;East Lothian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UK\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, on the B1348, close to &lt;a href=\"Levenhall%20Links\"&gt;Levenhall Links&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prestongrange%20Industrial%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Prestongrange Industrial Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prestonpans\"&gt;Prestonpans&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Prestongrange%20House\"&gt;Prestongrange House&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name comes from the Morisons of Prestongrange. A part of Prestongrange were purchased by John Morison from the Kerr family in 1609. He was a burgess of Edinburgh, a bailie (1581) and treasurer of Edinburgh (1588). His son Sir Alexander Morison, a &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Session\"&gt;Lord of Session&lt;/a&gt;, developed the harbour. The property was purchased in 1746 from William Morrison by William Grant.\nHistory.\nIn 1526, the &lt;a href=\"Cistercian\"&gt;Cistercian&lt;/a&gt; monks of &lt;a href=\"Holyrood%20Abbey\"&gt;Holyrood Abbey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Newbattle%20Abbey\"&gt;Newbattle Abbey&lt;/a&gt; received permission from King &lt;a href=\"James%20V\"&gt;James V&lt;/a&gt; for the construction of a port in place called \"Gilbertis-draucht\". The Abbot leased the port to Alexander Atkinsoun or Achesoun, and the port was known as Acheson's Haven and sometimes \"New Haven\" until the 17th century. The monks could also collect \"port monies, customs and duties\". There was at least one &lt;a href=\"gristmill\"&gt;mill&lt;/a&gt;, and a stone &lt;a href=\"fort\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt; with underground &lt;a href=\"bank%20vault\"&gt;vaults&lt;/a&gt; which was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Cromwell\"&gt;Oliver Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; in 1650 on his way to &lt;a href=\"Leith\"&gt;Leith&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe harbour was used to load building materials for the fort on &lt;a href=\"Inchkeith\"&gt;Inchkeith&lt;/a&gt; in 1555. In 1557 John Acheson of \"Mylnhaven or Gilbertis Drawcht\" and his wife Jonet Heriot lived nearby and collected customs duties. During the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Reformation\"&gt;Scottish Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, in April 1560 English troops commanded by &lt;a href=\"William%20Grey%2C%2013th%20Baron%20Grey%20de%20Wilton\"&gt;Lord Grey de Wilton&lt;/a&gt; marched from &lt;a href=\"Berwick%20upon%20Tweed\"&gt;Berwick upon Tweed&lt;/a&gt; to join the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Leith\"&gt;Siege of Leith&lt;/a&gt;. Passing through &lt;a href=\"Dunglass\"&gt;Dunglass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Linton\"&gt;East Linton&lt;/a&gt;, the English army camped at &lt;a href=\"Prestongrange\"&gt;Prestongrange&lt;/a&gt; on 4 April where the lighter artillery pieces for the siege were landed from ships at Acheson's Haven.\nThe harbour was managed by Alexander Acheson, whose wife Isobel Gray died in 1565. Her inventory is an important record of the possessions of a wealthy Scottish woman. In September 1569 &lt;a href=\"Regent%20Moray\"&gt;Regent Moray&lt;/a&gt; granted the custom duties of the \"Newhaven of Preston\" to Helen Acheson and her husband &lt;a href=\"Archibald%20Stewart%20%28merchant%29\"&gt;Archibald Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, a brother of &lt;a href=\"James%20Stewart%2C%201st%20Lord%20Doune\"&gt;James Stewart&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Doune%20Castle\"&gt;Doune&lt;/a&gt;. The rights were entailed to Alexander Acheson of Gosford's son, also called Alexander Acheson.\nMark Acheson of Acheson's Haven undertook in 1587 to pay custom duties for salt exports to &lt;a href=\"John%20Chisholm%20%28soldier%29\"&gt;John Chisholm&lt;/a&gt;, comptroller of the Royal Artillery. In 1591 &lt;a href=\"Euphame%20MacCalzean\"&gt;Euphame MacCalzean&lt;/a&gt; was convicted of witchcraft on several charges including attending an assembly of witches at \"Atkynson's Haven\" where an image of &lt;a href=\"James%20VI%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;James VI&lt;/a&gt; was given to the devil for the destruction of the king. &lt;a href=\"Agnes%20Sampson\"&gt;Agnes Sampson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Berwick%20witch%20trials\"&gt;Barbara Napier&lt;/a&gt; were also at this event.\nA part of the harbour structure known as the \"bulwark\" and \"Millhaven\" was demolished accidentally by the \"Margaret of Leith\" captained by Thomas Melville on 1 April 1607. His partners undertook to recompense the owner, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Kerr%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Lothian\"&gt;Mark Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the middle of the 18th century, the Haven was a busy port, exporting oysters, salt, local glassware, ceramics, bricks, fireclay, coal, and chemicals, including &lt;a href=\"sulphuric%20acid\"&gt;sulphuric acid&lt;/a&gt;. Imports were &lt;a href=\"brandy\"&gt;brandy&lt;/a&gt; from France, &lt;a href=\"port%20wine\"&gt;port wine&lt;/a&gt; from Portugal, &lt;a href=\"Delft\"&gt;Delft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"china%20%28material%29\"&gt;china&lt;/a&gt; from the Low countries, &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; from the Baltic port &lt;a href=\"Danzig\"&gt;Danzig&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fur\"&gt;fur&lt;/a&gt;s from Canada. A map of 1773 shows the port having two &lt;a href=\"Breakwater%20%28structure%29\"&gt;breakwater&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe importance of the Haven is reflected in the fact that it has customs jurisdiction over the coastline from Figgate Burn, &lt;a href=\"Portobello%2C%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Portobello&lt;/a&gt; all the way to the &lt;a href=\"River%20Tyne%2C%20Scotland\"&gt;Tyne&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Belhaven%2C%20Scotland\"&gt;Belhaven&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the late 19th century, ships from the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt; brought &lt;a href=\"rock%20salt\"&gt;rock salt&lt;/a&gt; to Morrison's Haven and exchanged it for coal and other commodities.\nUp to the late 1920s, the Haven exported large amounts of coal and bricks. Then it became disused, and the harbour was filled in and the site was landscaped. At the same time, Prestongrange's traditional industries declined apace.\nMasons and Freemasons.\nThere was a &lt;a href=\"Stonemasonry\"&gt;stonemasons'&lt;/a&gt; lodge in existence at Acheson's Haven from at least 1599. The written records of this lodge commence on 9 January 1599. Over time the 'operative' stonemasons admitted men who were not stonemasons and by the early 18th century it was recognizably a &lt;a href=\"Freemasonry\"&gt;Masonic&lt;/a&gt; Lodge. The Lodge's Minutes are therefore the oldest records in the world of a Masonic Lodge. Although this lodge was represented at the foundation meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Lodge%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, on 30 November 1736, it decided not to participate and remained independent until 1814 when it finally become a daughter Lodge of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. The Lodge ceased to function in 1853. The Minute Books of the Lodge were put up for auction by descendants of the last Lodge Secretary and were purchased by the Grand Lodge of Scotland in July 1980.\nMorrison's Haven today.\nThe Prestongrange Community Archaeological Project, started in 2004, confirmed the importance of Morrison's Haven. 18th century glass and pottery manufacture was totally dependent on the harbour. It developed into a mechanised working port and underwent frequent repair and improvement.\nThe PCA Project enabled local residents to learn skills related to &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Haven is on the route of the &lt;a href=\"John%20Muir%20Way\"&gt;John Muir Way&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"long-distance%20footpath\"&gt;long-distance footpath&lt;/a&gt; along the East Lothian coast, starting at &lt;a href=\"Fisherrow\"&gt;Fisherrow&lt;/a&gt; and terminating at &lt;a href=\"Dunglass\"&gt;Dunglass&lt;/a&gt;.\nExternal links.\nNone of these links work, October 2020.
