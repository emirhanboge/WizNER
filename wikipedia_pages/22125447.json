    "text": "\"Tattooed Millionaire\" is the first single from &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Dickinson\"&gt;Bruce Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;'s debut solo album, \"&lt;a href=\"Tattooed%20Millionaire\"&gt;Tattooed Millionaire&lt;/a&gt;\". It was released on 11 April 1990. \"Tattooed Millionaire\" reached number 18 on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK charts&lt;/a&gt;. The promotional video was directed by &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Thorgerson\"&gt;Storm Thorgerson&lt;/a&gt;. According to \"Ultimate Classic Rock\", the song is about \"celebrity tabloid rockers\". A 1990 review published in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Georgia%20Straight\"&gt;The Georgia Straight&lt;/a&gt;\", says the song \"takes a not-so-subtle stab at the excesses of the L.A. rock \u2019n\u2019 roll lifestyle, particularly that led by &lt;a href=\"Vince%20Neil\"&gt;Vince Neil&lt;/a&gt; and his Motley gang\". &lt;a href=\"Nikki%20Sixx\"&gt;Nikki Sixx&lt;/a&gt; has stated that the song is about him, inspired by Dickinson's then-wife cheating on him with Sixx and then Dickinson finding out about it after reading \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dirt\"&gt;The Dirt&lt;/a&gt;\", though that is doubtful since \"Tattooed Millionaire\" was released eleven years before \"The Dirt\" was published."
