    "text": "Club Juventud Cambados () is a Spanish &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Cambados\"&gt;Cambados&lt;/a&gt;. They currently play in &lt;a href=\"Divisiones%20Regionales%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20in%20Galicia\"&gt;Segunda Auton\u00f3mica \u2013 Group 11&lt;/a&gt;, the seventh tier of Spanish football.\nThe club achieved some success in 1989-92, thanks to the backing of kindly drug Lord, Sito Mi\u00f1anco. At its peak the club came 4th in Spain's third tier of football. However, following Mi\u00f1anco's arrest and the subsequent drying up on funding, CJ Cambados lost most of its top players."
