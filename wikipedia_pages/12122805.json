    "text": "The Gunpowder Cellar () is a historic building in &lt;a href=\"Tartu\"&gt;Tartu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; which now functions as a &lt;a href=\"beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"restaurant\"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name is derived from the restaurant's location: it is situated in an 18th-century gunpowder cellar constructed in 1768\u20131778 by order of &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20II%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Catherine II of Russia&lt;/a&gt; on the site of an earlier &lt;a href=\"fort\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt;, making use of the natural valley and pre-existing very thick brick walls for added safety. The building served as a gunpowder cellar until 1809 when it was converted to a beer storage room. At the end of the 19th century the building began to be used by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Tartu\"&gt;University of Tartu&lt;/a&gt; which meant that lectures and scientific work were often conducted on top of gunpowder barrels. In the 1990s it functioned as a large medieval restaurant before reopening in 2001 as a pub and disco though retaining a wine cellar.\nIts unique structure also lends it a unique distinction: it is in the \"&lt;a href=\"Guinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records\"&gt;Guinness Book of World Records&lt;/a&gt;\" for having the highest pub ceiling in the world, at .\nThe restaurant is a popular meeting place among Tartu's student population. It boasts a regular cultural programme, including a number of plays by the &lt;a href=\"Vanemuine\"&gt;Vanemuine&lt;/a&gt; theatre. This programme includes regular live music events."
