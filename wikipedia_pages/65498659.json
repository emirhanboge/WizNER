    "text": "The 1992\u201393 Women's National League Cup was a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; competition in &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20football%20in%20England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; organised by the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Women's Football Association&lt;/a&gt;. It was the second edition of the competition, which was later run by the Football Association as the Women's Premier League Cup and is now known as the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Women%27s%20National%20League%20Cup\"&gt;FA Women's National League Cup&lt;/a&gt; .\nThe League Cup included top-flight clubs from the season's &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20WFA%20National%20League%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;1992\u201393 WFA National League Premier Division&lt;/a&gt; and second-tier clubs of the Northern and Southern Divisions.\nIn the final at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt;, the defending &lt;a href=\"1991%E2%80%9392%20WFA%20Women%27s%20National%20League%20Cup\"&gt;1991\u201392 League Cup&lt;/a&gt;-winners, &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20W.F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;, retained the trophy and completed a &lt;a href=\"Treble%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;domestic treble&lt;/a&gt; in 1992\u201393.\nWembley final.\nArsenal and &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20W.F.C.\"&gt;Knowsley United&lt;/a&gt; won their respective semi-finals against &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%20L.F.C.\"&gt;Wimbledon L.F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.%20%28women%29\"&gt;Leasowe Pacific&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 1992\u201393 competition ended with a final at Wembley Stadium in London. Kicking off at 12.15pm on 29 May 1993, the women's final was held prior to the &lt;a href=\"1993%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20play-off%20Final\"&gt;men's Third Division play-off final&lt;/a&gt; at the venue.\nBefore a sparse crowd, Arsenal Ladies beat Knowsley United 3\u20130 to retain the trophy. The \"&lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20Echo\"&gt;Liverpool Echo&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that the three Arsenal goals were all scored in the second half. Arsenal had won the WFA Cup a month earlier by the same scoreline.\nKnowsley's squad contained three England regulars, &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Burke\"&gt;Karen Burke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clare%20Taylor\"&gt;Clare Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kerry%20Davis\"&gt;Kerry Davis&lt;/a&gt;. Taylor was an international footballer and &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20cricket\"&gt;cricketer&lt;/a&gt;, and two months after the League Cup final she was in the England team that won the &lt;a href=\"1993%20Women%27s%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1993 Women's Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt; on 1 August; she became the first woman to play in finals at Wembley and &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Lord's&lt;/a&gt;, and did so in the same year.\nArsenal manager &lt;a href=\"Vic%20Akers\"&gt;Vic Akers&lt;/a&gt; recalled that the women's teams were not given use of the main dressing rooms at Wembley. \"We changed in the opposite end to where the tunnel was.\"\nThis remains the only women's League Cup or National League Cup final to be played at Wembley. It is also one of the only competitive women's club games held at the old Wembley Stadium. Previously, the venue had hosted the &lt;a href=\"England%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England women's team&lt;/a&gt; and a 1990 friendly between Doncaster Belles and Friends of Fulham. The only regular women's football at Wembley has been the FA Cup final, annually &lt;a href=\"2015%20FA%20Women%27s%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;."
