    "text": "The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) is one of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;eight legally recognised minor political parties&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; that follow the direction of the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Chinese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; (CCP). It was founded in January 1948, during the height of the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Chinese Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, by members of the left wing of the &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; (KMT), especially those who were against &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt;'s policies. The first Chairman of the party was General &lt;a href=\"Li%20Jishen\"&gt;Li Jishen&lt;/a&gt;, a senior Nationalist military commander who had many disputes with Chiang over the years, while &lt;a href=\"Soong%20Ching-ling\"&gt;Soong Ching-ling&lt;/a&gt; (the widow of &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yat-sen\"&gt;Sun Yat-sen&lt;/a&gt;) was named Honorary Chairwoman. Other early leading members were &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Kunlun\"&gt;Wang Kunlun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheng%20Qian\"&gt;Cheng Qian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"He%20Xiangning\"&gt;He Xiangning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Zhiyue\"&gt;Tao Zhiyue&lt;/a&gt;. The party claims to be the true heir of &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yat-sen\"&gt;Sun Yat-sen&lt;/a&gt;'s legacy and his &lt;a href=\"Three%20Principles%20of%20the%20People\"&gt;Three Principles of the People&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of 2017, it had 131,410 members.\nSoong Ching-ling served as &lt;a href=\"Vice%20President%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Vice President of the People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; and Honorary &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;President of the People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. Li Jishen served as Vice Chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20People%27s%20Government%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%20%281949%E2%80%9354%29\"&gt;Central People's Government&lt;/a&gt; and Vice Chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Military%20Commission%20%28China%29\"&gt;Central Military Commission&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the officially sanctioned political parties of the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, the Revolutionary Committee is seen as second in status to the CCP. Thus, the Revolutionary Committee is allotted the second highest number of seats in the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20People%27s%20Political%20Consultative%20Conference\"&gt;People's Political Consultative Conference&lt;/a&gt; (30%). It also owns numerous assets, some formerly owned by the Kuomintang, throughout mainland China. The Revolutionary Committee operates a range of party-owned institutions, such as party schools.\nHistory.\nAfter the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the relationship between the Chinese Kuomintang and the CCP, who had allied to fight the Japanese, became increasingly tense; ultimately, both sides restarted the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, which World War II had interrupted.\nIn 1945 and 1946, members of the Kuomintang's left formed the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Principles%20of%20the%20People%20Confederation%20of%20Comrades\"&gt;Three Principles of the People Confederation of Comrades&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang%20Democratic%20Promotion%20Association\"&gt;Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association&lt;/a&gt; in Chongqing and Guangzhou, respectively.\nIn November 1947, the first joint representative meeting of the Kuomintang left was held in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;; on 1 January 1948, the meeting announced the official establishment of the \"Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee\", and nominated &lt;a href=\"Soong%20Ching-ling\"&gt;Soong Ching-ling&lt;/a&gt;, the widow of Sun Yat-sen, as the Honorary Chairwoman of the Revolutionary Committee (despite Soong Ching-ling never formally joining the commission).\nChairman &lt;a href=\"Li%20Jishen\"&gt;Li Jishen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"He%20Xiangning\"&gt;He Xiangning&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Feng%20Yuxiang\"&gt;Feng Yuxiang&lt;/a&gt; were selected as the central leadership of the organization.\nIn 1949, Li Jishen and other representatives of the RCCK were invited by the CCP to participate in &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20People%27s%20Political%20Consultative%20Conference\"&gt;Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, members of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee maintained positions in the municipal and central governments.\nIn November 1949, the second congress of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee was held in Beijing. At the second congress, the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, Chinese Nationalist Democratic Promotion Association, the Comrades of the Three Peoples Principles, and other members of the Kuomintang's left wing agreed to merge and form the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.\nToday, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang focuses on improving relations with the Kuomintang on &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, and its membership mainly consists of the descendants of Kuomintang revolutionaries. It recruits members with current ties to Taiwan who support &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20unification\"&gt;Chinese unification&lt;/a&gt;.\nCentral Committee.\nThe Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has six working departments including the General Office, the Organization Department, the Propaganda Department, the Liaison Department, the Social Services Department, and the Research Department."
