    "text": "Charles Manyuchi (born 19 November 1989) is a &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;an professional &lt;a href=\"Boxing\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt; who briefly held the &lt;a href=\"WBC%20Silver\"&gt;WBC Silver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"welterweight\"&gt;welterweight&lt;/a&gt; title.\nManyuchi made his professional debut in 2009, and won the &lt;a href=\"African%20Boxing%20Union\"&gt;ABU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"welterweight\"&gt;welterweight&lt;/a&gt; title in 2013. In 2014, he won the &lt;a href=\"World%20Boxing%20Council\"&gt;WBC&lt;/a&gt; International welterweight title against Patrick Allotey. He successfully defended his WBC crown in &lt;a href=\"Lusaka\"&gt;Lusaka&lt;/a&gt; against Devis Caceres. He was awarded the Zimbabwe's Sports Person of the Year accolade in 2014. He made another successful defense of the WBC International belt against Gianluca Frezza, in the latter's native &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nManyuchi further advanced his career by beating Dmitry Mikhailenko in &lt;a href=\"Yekaterinburg\"&gt;Yekaterinburg&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"WBC%20Silver\"&gt;WBC Silver&lt;/a&gt; title. Manyuchi won the fight by &lt;a href=\"unanimous%20decision\"&gt;unanimous decision&lt;/a&gt; (118-110, 116-114, 115-113). Manyuchi's run of 17 consecutive victories came to an end against &lt;a href=\"Qudratillo%20Abduqaxorov\"&gt;Kudratillo Abdukakhorov&lt;/a&gt;. Abdukakhorov proved to be too much for Manyuchi, beating him with a first round &lt;a href=\"Knockout%23Technical%20knockout\"&gt;technical knockout&lt;/a&gt; (TKO) after dropping him twice. Manyuchi mocked Abduqaxorov prior to the fight, saying that he was \"in a different league\" while his manager claimed they were already planning to fight for the WBC world title. Abdukakhorov claimed Manyuchi was \"overconfident\".\nManyuchi has since gone into the middleweight division and he is the current WBF Middleweight Champion after knocking out Argentina's Diego Gallardo in Harare. \nCharles is the first world champion from Zimbabwe."
