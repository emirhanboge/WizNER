The &lt;a href=\"specific%20name%20%28zoology%29\"&gt;specific epithet&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"noun\"&gt;noun&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"genitive%20case\"&gt;genitive case&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistribution.\nThe distribution of \"Scutalus mariopenai\" includes &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20non-marine%20molluscs%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"type%20locality%20%28biology%29\"&gt;type locality&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Catzcal\"&gt;Catzcal&lt;/a&gt; (09\u00b054\u201943\u2019S 077\u00b049\u201940\u2019W), &lt;a href=\"Ancash%20Region\"&gt;Ancash Region&lt;/a&gt;, Peru. &lt;a href=\"Type%20specimen\"&gt;Type specimen&lt;/a&gt;s are stored in the Netherlands Centre for Biodiversity &lt;a href=\"Naturalis\"&gt;Naturalis&lt;/a&gt;, Leiden, the Netherlands, and in the private collection of V. Mogoll\u00f3n Avila, Lima, Peru.\nDescription.\n\"Scutalus mariopenai\" is characterized by the broadly expanded and callous lip, the fine, punctuate granulation, and the whitish-corneous ground colour, with four brown spiral bands on the &lt;a href=\"last%20whorl\"&gt;last whorl&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"gastropod%20shell\"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt; height is up to 41.1\u00a0mm, 1.65 times as long as wide, &lt;a href=\"Umbilicus%20%28mollusc%29\"&gt;umbilicate&lt;/a&gt; and deeply perforated, conical, with slightly convex sides and solid. Ground colour is uniformly whitish-corneous, the upper &lt;a href=\"whorl%20%28mollusc%29\"&gt;whorls&lt;/a&gt; are lighter, with four spiral light chestnut-brown bands, a small one below the white-lined &lt;a href=\"suture%20%28gastropod%29\"&gt;suture&lt;/a&gt;, two broader ones above and below the periphery (which in some specimens are faintly subdivided into two equally broad bands) and a fourth band encircling the umbilicus. The surface is lustreless, with growth striae and spiral lines of fine, punctuate granulation, starting shallowly on the postnepionic whorl, but becoming rapidly more conspicuous on the following and fading away inside the umbilicus. The &lt;a href=\"protoconch\"&gt;protoconch&lt;/a&gt; is pit-reticulate. The shell has 6.3 whorls that are somewhat convex. The last whorl is saccate. The suture is impressed, somewhat crenulate, at the aperture ascending in front. The &lt;a href=\"aperture%20%28mollusc%29\"&gt;aperture&lt;/a&gt; is large, ovate, glossy white inside with the pattern visible in banded specimens. Apertural margins are converging. The aperture is 1.30 times as long as wide, 0.70 times the total height. The peristome is broadly expanded and backwardly reflexed, glossy whitish. &lt;a href=\"columella%20%28gastropod%29\"&gt;Columellar&lt;/a&gt; margin is straight, broadly expanded and merging into the rather thick parietal callus.\nThe height of the shell is 36.7\u201341.1\u00a0mm. The width of the shell is 21.9\u201336.2\u00a0mm. The shell has 6\u20136.5\u00a0mm.\nDimensions of the &lt;a href=\"holotype\"&gt;holotype&lt;/a&gt; are as follows: The height of the holotype is 41.1\u00a0mm. The width of the shell is 26.2\u00a0mm. The height of the aperture is 22.6\u00a0mm. The width of the aperture is 17.9\u00a0mm. The height of the last whorl is 29.6\u00a0mm. The shell has 6.3 whorls.\nType material: apertural and abapertural views of two shells of \"Scutalus mariopenai\" showing its color variability:\nLiving animal is whitish- to pale-grey, with a dark-greyish band along the foot. &lt;a href=\"Tentacles\"&gt;Tentacles&lt;/a&gt; are dark-grey near the eye-tips, lighter at the base.\nThis species is closely allied to \"&lt;a href=\"Scutalus%20ortizpuentei\"&gt;Scutalus ortizpuentei&lt;/a&gt;\" Weyrauch, 1967 which was described from Dept. &lt;a href=\"Cajamarca\"&gt;Cajamarca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"R%C3%ADo%20Chancay\"&gt;R\u00edo Chancay&lt;/a&gt; valley, between &lt;a href=\"Chiclayo\"&gt;Chiclayo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chota%2C%20Peru\"&gt;Chota&lt;/a&gt;, 80\u00a0km north of &lt;a href=\"Quinden\"&gt;Quinden&lt;/a&gt; (ca. 06\u00b038\u2019S 079\u00b005\u2019W) in Peru. It differs from this species by being smaller (41 vs. 48\u00a0mm shell height), having a smaller aperture, and the lip more broadly expanded. The faintly visible subdivision of the spiral bands around the periphery, visible in some specimens of \"Scutalus mariopenai\", resembles the more pronounced colour pattern in \"Scutalus ortizpuentei\". It may also be compared to \"&lt;a href=\"Scutalus%20cretaceus\"&gt;Scutalus cretaceus&lt;/a&gt;\" (Pfeiffer, 1855) from which it differs by being less elongate, having a stronger &lt;a href=\"sculpture%20%28mollusc%29\"&gt;sculpture&lt;/a&gt; on the last whorl, having the inside of the aperture whitish coloured; having the lip more broadly expanded.\nReferences.\nThis article incorporates CC-BY-3.0 text from the reference."
