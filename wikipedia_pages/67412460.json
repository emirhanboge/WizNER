The website's critics consensus reads, \"Though the show around her isn't quite up to snuff, there's no denying the pleasure of Jodie Turner-Smith's powerful turn as the one-and-only Anne Boleyn.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Independent\"&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;\" both gave the drama 3 stars out 5. &lt;a href=\"Lucy%20Mangan\"&gt;Lucy Mangan&lt;/a&gt; of the former said the series \"works\" but criticised its \"silly surplus of metaphors\" and portrayal of Henry. Adam White of the latter found the show a \"soapy romp\" but that it made sense for the story being told. Turner-Smith's performance was widely praised. Beth Webb of \"&lt;a href=\"Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;\" called the series a \"showcase of Jodie Turner-Smith's resilience as a performer\" and mentioned how the \"small but well-assembled supporting cast elevates her performance\".\nThere was criticism of &lt;a href=\"Black-washing\"&gt;Black-washing&lt;/a&gt;, as some of the actors were &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt; and the characters portrayed were &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Times\"&gt;Radio Times&lt;/a&gt; described this as \"identity-conscious casting\" and quoted the actor &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Stanley\"&gt;Mark Stanley&lt;/a&gt;: \"It was all about this being the right person for the job, rather than what we as a society might perceive as the \u2018right look\u2019 for the job\"."
