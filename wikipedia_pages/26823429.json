His published works notably include \"Our Daily Bread\", a collection of short spiritual texts and a biography of Pope John Paul II, \"Pope John Paul II: The Life of My Friend\".\nIn May 2009, Malinski was accused of having informed upon Pope John Paul II to the Polish authorities during the &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; regime. Malinski, however, denied the accusations."
