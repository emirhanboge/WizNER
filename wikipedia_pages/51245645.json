    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Montenegro\"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; is one of the last countries in Europe that does not have any &lt;a href=\"motorway\"&gt;motorway&lt;/a&gt;s. This situation will change in the foreseeable future, since on 11 May 2015 the construction of motorways has already begun. It is to connect the Montenegrin town and harbor of &lt;a href=\"Bar%2C%20Montenegro\"&gt;Bar&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; through the border crossing at &lt;a href=\"Boljare%2C%20Sjenica\"&gt;Boljare&lt;/a&gt;. From there, a Serbian portion of the motorway should continue towards &lt;a href=\"Belgrade\"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; (a part labeled as A2 motorway is already under construction), which will create a continuous motorway connection between Central Europe and the Montenegrin coast.\nOn Montenegrin motorways, the planned speed-limit may be of .\nBeograd\u2013Bar Motorway.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Belgrade%E2%80%93Bar%20motorway\"&gt;Belgrade\u2013Bar motorway&lt;/a&gt;, also known in &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20language\"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20language\"&gt;Montenegrin&lt;/a&gt; as \u0410\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0442 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u2013\u0411\u0430\u0440 (\"Autoput Beograd\u2013Bar\") will measure and be part of the &lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E763\"&gt;European route E763&lt;/a&gt; (E763). Construction has already begun in Serbia as the A2 motorway with a length of , as well as in Montenegro (Smokovac\u2013Mate\u0161evo). The whole motorway in Montenegro from Bar to the border with Serbia in Boljare will be . It is a challenging project, which has been divided into five component parts (\"dionica\"). It will have a total of 42 tunnels and 92 bridges. The construction is financed by &lt;a href=\"public%E2%80%93private%20partnership\"&gt;public\u2013private partnership&lt;/a&gt; projects; the contractor is the Chinese company CRBC. The motorway have a planned cost in excess of \u20ac809.6 million. Probably, the motorway will be subjected to a toll payment like in other countries of the former Yugoslavia. For the part currently in construction - - the toll should amount to \u20ac3.28.\nAdriatic\u2013Ionian Motorway.\nThe planned &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%E2%80%93Ionian%20motorway\"&gt;Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway&lt;/a&gt; at around 100\u00a0km (95.2\u00a0km) long should link both Montenegro with &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; in the west and in the east its capital Podgorica with &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;. From there it may continue through Albania and further reach &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. A part of the Podgorica's bypass, around in length, may be &lt;a href=\"concurrency%20%28road%29\"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; with the Bar\u2013Boljare motorway."
