    "text": "Isaac Benjamin Davis (born March 22, 1987) is an American former &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt;. From 2010 through 2016, he played in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) for the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Athletics\"&gt;Oakland Athletics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt;.\nDavis led his high school team to three straight &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20State\"&gt;Arizona State&lt;/a&gt; championships as a &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt;. As a hitter he &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batted&lt;/a&gt; .447, while as a pitcher he recorded a 23\u20130 &lt;a href=\"Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29\"&gt;win\u2013loss record&lt;/a&gt;, a 1.85 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; (ERA), and 14 &lt;a href=\"save%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt;s. He also pitched for the gold medal-winning U.S.A. Youth National Team in the 2003 World Youth Championships, and was the most valuable player of the 2004 &lt;a href=\"AFLAC\"&gt;AFLAC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"All-American\"&gt;All-American&lt;/a&gt; High School Baseball Classic. Ranked second in the nation as a freshman for &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20State%20University\"&gt;Arizona State University&lt;/a&gt; by both \"&lt;a href=\"Baseball%20America\"&gt;Baseball America&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Collegiate%20Baseball\"&gt;Collegiate Baseball&lt;/a&gt;\", he was named &lt;a href=\"Pac-10\"&gt;Pac-10&lt;/a&gt; Conference Freshman of the Year, as he became the first freshman ever to lead the conference in &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt; (RBIs). He hit .353 with a .605 &lt;a href=\"slugging%20percentage\"&gt;slugging percentage&lt;/a&gt; in college, threw a &lt;a href=\"fastball\"&gt;fastball&lt;/a&gt; that reached 94 miles per hour, and was a two-time All-American and a three-time All-Pac-10 selection.\nDavis was drafted 18th overall in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20MLB%20Draft\"&gt;2008 MLB Draft&lt;/a&gt;. In the minor leagues, he batted .288 with a .371 &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt; (OBP), and a .467 slugging percentage, and was the Mets 2009 Organizational Player of the Year.\nThe Mets called him up to the majors in April 2010. His 11 &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s prior to the &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt; break that season tied him for the second-most ever by a Mets rookie. He set the Mets rookie record for &lt;a href=\"total%20base\"&gt;total base&lt;/a&gt;s (230), and tied the Mets rookie records for &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt; (72) and &lt;a href=\"extra-base%20hit\"&gt;extra-base hit&lt;/a&gt;s (53). He was named the first baseman on \"Baseball America\"s 2010 All-Rookie Team. During a 2011 season shortened by an ankle injury, Davis batted .302. In 2012, he batted .227, but his 32 home runs were 5th-best in the National League. In 2013, he split his time between the Mets and AAA Las Vegas. He was traded to the Pirates in April 2014, and traded to the Athletics after the season. He played for &lt;a href=\"Israel%20at%20the%20World%20Baseball%20Classic%232017%20tournament\"&gt;Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly years.\nDavis was born in Edina, Minnesota, to Millie (n\u00e9e Gollinger) Davis and &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Davis%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Ron Davis&lt;/a&gt;. His father was a major league pitcher who pitched in 481 games in the majors in his 11-year career. His father was a &lt;a href=\"Power%20pitcher\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"relief%20pitcher\"&gt;relief pitcher&lt;/a&gt;, and an American League &lt;a href=\"1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star in 1981&lt;/a&gt;. He pitched from 1978 to 1988, starting with the New York Yankees (1978\u201381, going 27\u201310 with 22 saves, primarily as the &lt;a href=\"setup%20man\"&gt;setup man&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Rich%20Gossage\"&gt;Rich Gossage&lt;/a&gt;). He pitched for the Minnesota Twins, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, and San Francisco Giants. His father retired at the age of 32 in 1988, however, so Ike remembers more from &lt;a href=\"old-timers%27%20game\"&gt;old-timers' game&lt;/a&gt;s, such as the one where, at age 12, he met &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Jeter\"&gt;Derek Jeter&lt;/a&gt;. He and his father are the 197th father-son combination to have both played in the major leagues.\nIke went to Cocopah Middle School. He took the baseball team to two straight state championships. He set a school record with 18 home runs in one season and 3 in one game. A field there was later named after him.\nDavis is &lt;a href=\"Jewish\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; through his mother. His mother, the youngest daughter of Bernard and Harriet Gollinger, is Jewish, and his father is &lt;a href=\"Baptist\"&gt;Baptist&lt;/a&gt;. Davis embraces both sides of his family\u2019s ancestry. His mother's family was from &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; and immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century. Of those who stayed behind, most of her family were murdered in &lt;a href=\"The%20Holocaust\"&gt;The Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; during World War II.\nDavis had a great aunt on his mother\u2019s side who was a &lt;a href=\"Holocaust%20survivor\"&gt;Holocaust survivor&lt;/a&gt;. Davis said: \"She was the one who knew everything that happened. She was able to come to the United States, and she brought the story with her.\" Davis' paternal grandfather was an American &lt;a href=\"paratrooper\"&gt;paratrooper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; who landed in France on &lt;a href=\"D-Day\"&gt;D-Day&lt;/a&gt; in 1944. He later helped liberate one of the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20concentration%20camps\"&gt;Nazi concentration camps&lt;/a&gt;.\nDavis' given names are Isaac and Benjamin (after his mother's grandfathers). Davis does not practice Judaism and is non-religious, but he stated: \"I am really proud of my Jewish heritage.\" He describes himself as \"culturally Jewish.\" He reflected: \"It's funny about Judaism; It doesn\u2019t matter if you're ultra-religious or not, as long as you know that it's in you or you're a part of it, everyone accepts you.\" He often uses the Jewish greeting \"&lt;a href=\"shalom\"&gt;shalom&lt;/a&gt;\". Davis says: \"I'm glad Jewish kids get to see they can grow up to be professional baseball players.\"\nAs a youth, he attended a five-day baseball fundamentals camp that his father continues to run for children ages 5\u201314. His father was also his &lt;a href=\"little%20league\"&gt;little league&lt;/a&gt; coach until Davis was 14.\nHis father said: \nPeople would say Ike was good because his dad was a player. But it's not that easy... I can tell Ike how to swing, I can teach him to pitch, [teach] the game of baseball, but he's the only one to make it to the big leagues. You can't teach heart and soul. That's what it takes to play in the game.\nHigh school.\nDavis attended &lt;a href=\"Chaparral%20High%20School%20%28Arizona%29\"&gt;Chaparral High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Scottsdale, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, where he won three state titles (2003\u201305). His father would throw him batting practice. He hit .559 as a sophomore, the school record, ahead of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Konerko\"&gt;Paul Konerko&lt;/a&gt;'s .558 in 1994. He also hit a school-record 23 &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt;s, breaking Konerko's record of 18. He followed that up by batting .425 as a junior (when he was also Arizona 4A Pitcher of the Year), and .450 as a senior. As a senior, he had a 92\u201393\u00a0mph fastball, to complement his &lt;a href=\"changeup\"&gt;changeup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slider%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;slider&lt;/a&gt;. He was ranked 12th in the country by \"&lt;a href=\"Baseball%20America\"&gt;Baseball America&lt;/a&gt;\", and was a high school All-American.\nIn 2003, he also pitched for the U.S.A. Youth National Team (16-under) in international play. They won the &lt;a href=\"gold%20medal\"&gt;gold medal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"International%20Baseball%20Federation\"&gt;International Baseball Federation&lt;/a&gt; XI \"AA\" World Youth Championships in &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. In 2004, he played on the U.S.A. Junior National Team (18-under). In his two seasons playing for Team U.S.A., he batted .404.\nIn 2004, he was one of 40 players from across the country chosen to play in the &lt;a href=\"AFLAC\"&gt;AFLAC&lt;/a&gt; All-American High School Baseball Classic. He won the &lt;a href=\"MVP\"&gt;MVP&lt;/a&gt; Award for the game, hitting the go-ahead home run for his team. The following year, he was MVP in the all star 2005 High School American Game.\nBy November 2004, the 17-year-old Davis was already and 194 pounds. In 2005, despite his having indicated he was going to go to college, he was drafted in the 19th round by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He elected not to sign.\nDavis graduated from high school with a .447 &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; in 320 at bats, with 48 doubles (a school record, ahead of Konerko's 44), 12 home runs, and 106 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt; (RBIs) (third in school history). As a pitcher he was a perfect 23\u20130, with a 1.85 ERA, 14 saves, and 213 &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt;s (a school record) in 174 &lt;a href=\"inning\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt;s. His teams were 95\u20138 over his sophomore, junior, and senior years.\nCollege baseball career.\nFreshman year (2006).\nDavis chose to attend &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20State%20University\"&gt;Arizona State University&lt;/a&gt; (ASU). In October 2005, he was ranked the # 2 freshman in the nation by both \"Baseball America\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Collegiate%20Baseball\"&gt;Collegiate Baseball&lt;/a&gt;\". He &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitched&lt;/a&gt; (as the team's Friday night &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;starter&lt;/a&gt;; the role given the \"ace\" of a college rotation), was the &lt;a href=\"designated%20hitter\"&gt;designated hitter&lt;/a&gt;, and played first base and &lt;a href=\"corner%20outfield\"&gt;corner outfield&lt;/a&gt;. In March 2006, he was named a &lt;a href=\"Louisville%20Slugger\"&gt;Louisville Slugger&lt;/a&gt; National Player of the Week, Pac-10 Conference Player of the Week, and College Baseball Foundation National Honor Roll Player of the Week for a week in which he batted .588 and drove in 13 &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;run&lt;/a&gt;s, in four games.\nIn 2006, with 65 RBIs in 227 at bats he became the first freshman ever to lead the Pac-10 in runs batted in during the regular season, and set the ASU freshman RBI record. Batting &lt;a href=\"Cleanup%20hitter\"&gt;clean-up&lt;/a&gt;, he hit .329 with 79 &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt;s (third all-time, for an ASU freshman), 23 doubles (tied for the Pac-10 lead, and tying the ASU record for doubles by a freshman), and a .542 slugging percentage in 58 games. His 9 home runs tied him with &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Horner\"&gt;Bob Horner&lt;/a&gt; (1976) for third all-time by a Sun Devil freshman, 2 behind &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Bonds\"&gt;Barry Bonds&lt;/a&gt; (11, in 1983). He was also the team's &lt;a href=\"opening%20day\"&gt;opening day&lt;/a&gt; starter, and pitched a team-high 12 starts. He was named a \"Collegiate Baseball\" Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American, &lt;a href=\"Rivals.com\"&gt;Rivals.com&lt;/a&gt; First-Team Freshman All-American, \"Baseball America\" Second-Team Freshman All-American, \"&lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Sports%20Review\"&gt;Jewish Sports Review&lt;/a&gt;\" First-Team All-American, &lt;a href=\"American%20Baseball%20Coaches%20Association\"&gt;American Baseball Coaches Association&lt;/a&gt; (ABCA) First-Team All-West Region, Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, and a member of the First-Team All-Pac-10.\nDavis spent the first part of the summer of 2006 with Team USA. He then played in 22 games for the &lt;a href=\"Anchorage%20Bucs\"&gt;Anchorage Bucs&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alaska%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Alaska Baseball League&lt;/a&gt;, and was named the # 10 prospect in the league by \"Baseball America\".\nSophomore year (2007).\nDavis demonstrated his versatility in an April 2007 game. He came to the mound with his team trailing 5\u20134, ended the inning by striking out a batter, and in the next half-inning &lt;a href=\"stolen%20base\"&gt;stole&lt;/a&gt; home as the lead runner in a triple steal. For his sophomore season, he primarily played &lt;a href=\"right%20field\"&gt;right field&lt;/a&gt; (batting .349 with 23 doubles\u2014tied for the conference lead\u2014and 61 RBIs, in 62 games) and pitched as a &lt;a href=\"middle%20reliever\"&gt;middle reliever&lt;/a&gt; (sporting a 1.35 ERA). He again received First-Team All-Pac-10 honors, and was named a \"Collegiate Baseball\" Louisville Slugger Third Team All-American, a &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Baseball%20Writers%20Association\"&gt;National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association&lt;/a&gt; (NCBWA) Third-Team All-American, and again a \"Jewish Sports Review\" First-Team All-American.\nIn the summer of 2007, he played for the &lt;a href=\"Wareham%20Gatemen\"&gt;Wareham Gatemen&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Cod%20League\"&gt;Cape Cod League&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"bone%20spur\"&gt;bone spur&lt;/a&gt; in his left wrist required surgery over the summer.\nJunior year (2008).\nHe was named a pre-season 2008 All-Pac-10 outfielder by Rivals.com, and a pre-season Third-Team All-American by both the NCBWA and \"Collegiate Baseball\". In consecutive weeks in March 2008 he was named both the Louisville Slugger National Player of the Week and the Pac-10 Conference Player of the Week. In the first week he hit .450 and struck out all four batters he faced. In the second week he batted .529 with a 1.412 slugging percentage, and recorded five outs from the mound, four by strikeout, without giving up a hit. He was the first Sun Devil to win the Pac-10-award in consecutive weeks since &lt;a href=\"Travis%20Buck\"&gt;Travis Buck&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. The College Baseball Foundation named him to its National All-Star Lineup.\nFor his junior season, Davis hit .385, with a .457 &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt; and a .742 slugging percentage. He hit 23 doubles (tied for the Pac-10 lead), 16 home runs, and 76 RBIs in 213 at bats over 52 games, while missing 10 games with a rib &lt;a href=\"Abdominal%20internal%20oblique%20muscle\"&gt;oblique&lt;/a&gt; muscle strain. He was 4\u20131 as a pitcher, with a 2.25 ERA, 4 saves, 20 strikeouts in 24 innings against 4 walks, and hit 94 miles per hour on the &lt;a href=\"radar%20gun\"&gt;radar gun&lt;/a&gt;. He also threw out four runners from right field. He was named ASU On Deck Circle Most Valuable Player; prior winners included &lt;a href=\"Dustin%20Pedroia\"&gt;Dustin Pedroia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Bloomquist\"&gt;Willie Bloomquist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Lo%20Duca\"&gt;Paul Lo Duca&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Bonds\"&gt;Barry Bonds&lt;/a&gt;. He received First-Team All-Pac-10 honors for the third straight year. He was also named a First Team All-American by \"Baseball America\", \"Collegiate Baseball\", the NCBWA, Rivals.com, and the ABCA. Four of his Sun Devils teammates that season went on to play in the major leagues: &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Wallace\"&gt;Brett Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Elmore\"&gt;Jake Elmore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Kipnis\"&gt;Jason Kipnis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Leake\"&gt;Mike Leake&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe hit .353 in his college career, with a .605 slugging percentage (10th-best in ASU history). He totaled 159 runs (8th-best), 244 hits, 33 homers (5th), 69 doubles (2nd, behind Dustin Pedroia), and 202 RBIs (3rd). On the mound, he ended his college career as the Sun Devils closer, and totaled a 7\u20135 mark with 4 saves and 78 strikeouts in his career. Davis was also a part of two Pac-10 Championship teams, and went to the &lt;a href=\"College%20World%20Series\"&gt;College World Series&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. He was named to the ASU All-Decade team.\nScouts felt he was at his best as a batter when he used the whole field. They noted that his bat speed allowed him to wait on pitches and drive them the other way, and that he was quick enough to catch up to good fastballs. &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Schlereth\"&gt;Mark Schlereth&lt;/a&gt; of \"ESPN\" observed: \"The bigger the game, the better he plays.\"\nMinor leagues.\nDavis was the 18th player taken in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20Draft\"&gt;2008 Major League Baseball Draft&lt;/a&gt;, chosen by the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; in his junior year as compensation for the Mets' loss of &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Glavine\"&gt;Tom Glavine&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"free%20agency\"&gt;free agency&lt;/a&gt;. He was drafted for his power bat. \"Baseball America\" ranked him the third-best college power hitter in the draft, and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" indicated that he projects to hit 25\u201330 home runs. He signed for $1.575 million.\nDavis said, \"It was a huge thrill. I was excited to be picked by New York.\" He received fatherly advice from his dad, and recalled: He just said they've got the best fans, and it's a blast because every game is live or die for them. It's a great environment to grow up playing baseball, and learning how to play under pressure in front of all those people. He loved it, and I'm looking forward to it, too.\nDavis was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Single-A\"&gt;Single-A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Cyclones\"&gt;Brooklyn Cyclones&lt;/a&gt;. On defense, he excelled, as he committed only one error in 492 total chances at first base, for a league-leading .998 fielding percentage. Uncharacteristically, he struggled on offense, batting only .256, without a home run in 58 games. Asked the following year to name his most embarrassing professional moment, he replied: \"Not hitting one home run in my first professional season.\" He noted:\nIt was first time I ever swung wood full time. I was learning how to play pro ball. I had never played every day in my life. That's totally different... You have to learn to conserve your energy. In college, you just left it all out on the field every game. In pro ball, you do that and you'll wear out, because you play every single day.\nIn 2009, Davis started the year with the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Lucie%20Mets\"&gt;St. Lucie Mets&lt;/a&gt;. He began to turn it around, hitting .289 with 7 home runs in 59 games. He was then promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Double-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Double-A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Binghamton%20Mets\"&gt;Binghamton Mets&lt;/a&gt;, where he came into his own, hitting .309 with 13 home runs, 41 RBIs, and a .565 slugging percentage in half a season. &lt;a href=\"Mako%20Oliveras\"&gt;Mako Oliveras&lt;/a&gt;, the B-Mets manager, described him by saying: \"Very live bat; the ball jumps off his bat when he makes contact. And as for defense, he's like a vacuum cleaner.\" For 2009, Davis was named the Mets Organizational Player of the Year.\nAfter the season the Mets assigned him to the &lt;a href=\"Surprise%20Rafters\"&gt;Surprise Rafters&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Fall%20League\"&gt;Arizona Fall League&lt;/a&gt;, where he hit .391. He was named to the Arizona Fall League's all star Rising Stars Game. In September 2009, he played for the gold-medal-winning U.S.A. World Cup team. In the off-season, \"Baseball America\" rated him the Mets\u2019 No. 4 prospect.\nPromoted to the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Bisons\"&gt;Buffalo Bisons&lt;/a&gt;, the Mets' &lt;a href=\"Triple-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Triple-A&lt;/a&gt; affiliate, to start the 2010 season, he hit .364 with a .500 on-base percentage in 10 games.\nFor the week ending June 24, 2013, Davis was the Pacific Coast League's Player of the Week. In 2013, in 10 games with the AAA &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%2051s\"&gt;Las Vegas 51s&lt;/a&gt;, he batted .364 with a .500 on-base percentage and a .636 slugging percentage.\nIn his minor league career, he batted .289, with a .376 OBP and a .487 slugging percentage in 752 at bats.\nMajor leagues.\nNew York Mets.\n2010.\nDavis played in &lt;a href=\"spring%20training\"&gt;spring training&lt;/a&gt; with the Mets in 2010, and led the team with a .480 average as he hit 3 homers. He also sparkled on defense, prompting &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Reyes%20%28shortstop%29\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Reyes&lt;/a&gt; to observe: \"People talk about his hitting, but he is one of the best defensive first basemen you will ever see for a player his age.\" Many Mets players were rooting for Davis to break camp with the team, but he was sent down to the minors at the end of spring training. On April 19, however, the Mets purchased Davis's minor league contract. At that point Davis had played only 65 games in his life above the Single-A level.\nDavis made his debut at &lt;a href=\"Citi%20Field\"&gt;Citi Field&lt;/a&gt; on April 19 against the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;. He singled in his first at bat, and had two singles in four at bats in a Mets win. \"This is awesome,\" he gushed. In a sign of acceptance and welcome, after the victory Mets veteran &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Francoeur\"&gt;Jeff Francoeur&lt;/a&gt; slapped a shaving-cream pie in his face. Davis had two multi-hit games in his first four games. In his fifth game, on April 23, he hit his first home run. It traveled , onto Shea Bridge at Citi Field, and was the longest home run of any Met at Citi Field. He had his first multi-home-run game on May 7.\nA gifted, slick-fielding defensive first baseman, in 3 of his first 21 games he made spectacular catches of &lt;a href=\"foul%20ball\"&gt;foul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Batted%20ball\"&gt;pop-ups&lt;/a&gt;, bracing himself against the railing in front of the first base &lt;a href=\"dugout%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;dugout&lt;/a&gt;, and then flipping over the railing as he caught the ball. The Davis said: \"I'm going to try to catch any ball I can. I've got long arms, I guess. I'd rather end the game, than worry about getting a bruise.\"\nThe Met fans began to treat him like a folk hero. The \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Post\"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;\" described him as a \"cult hero.\" Within a month of his debut, he had become a fan favorite. \"I Like Ike\" banners began appearing at Citi Field, a phrase once used in the decades-prior presidential campaigns of &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower\"&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt;. Weeks later, he recalled: I had such nerves the first few days. I didn't even have an approach. It was just see the ball, hit the ball. Only now am I settling in, getting the chance to think about how a pitcher is going to approach me. \nWhile the Mets had appeared uncertain whether Davis could handle the pressure of the major leagues as spring training ended, by mid-May\u2014just a month after calling him up to the majors\u2014they moved him to the &lt;a href=\"cleanup%20hitter\"&gt;cleanup&lt;/a&gt; spot in the &lt;a href=\"batting%20order%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting order&lt;/a&gt;. Manager &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Manuel\"&gt;Jerry Manuel&lt;/a&gt; said: \"I think we're going to try to leave him there for a while. I think he's ready to handle that.\"\nOn June 8, Davis hit his first career &lt;a href=\"walk%20off%20home%20run\"&gt;walk off home run&lt;/a&gt;, against the Padres' &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Mujica\"&gt;Edward Mujica&lt;/a&gt;. His 11 home runs prior to the All Star break tied with &lt;a href=\"Benny%20Agbayani\"&gt;Benny Agbayani&lt;/a&gt; (1999) for the second-most by a Mets rookie, behind &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Swoboda\"&gt;Ron Swoboda&lt;/a&gt; (15, in 1965).\nBy September 26, as advanced defense metrics reflected a \"UZR/150\" (&lt;a href=\"ultimate%20zone%20rating\"&gt;ultimate zone rating&lt;/a&gt;) of 12.5, putting him second in baseball behind Oakland's &lt;a href=\"Daric%20Barton\"&gt;Daric Barton&lt;/a&gt;, sportswriter Mike Silva mused as to whether he could win a &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Glove\"&gt;Gold Glove&lt;/a&gt;. Using the advanced metric &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Runs%20Saved\"&gt;Defensive Runs Saved&lt;/a&gt;, sportswriter John Dewan indicated that Davis was best in the NL and second-best in baseball, having saved 14 runs, again behind only Barton in the majors. He showed good range, and saved a number of throws with his soft hands on scoops.\nFor the season, he was second among all NL rookies in runs (73), doubles (33), walks (72), extra-base hits (53), on-base percentage (.351), and &lt;a href=\"On-base%20plus%20slugging\"&gt;OPS&lt;/a&gt; (.791). He was also third in RBIs (71) and slugging percentage (.440), and tied for third in home runs (19).\nHe set the Mets rookie record for total bases (230). He also tied &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Mazzilli\"&gt;Lee Mazzilli&lt;/a&gt;'s 1977 Mets rookie record in walks (72) and &lt;a href=\"Ty%20Wigginton\"&gt;Ty Wigginton&lt;/a&gt;'s 2003 Mets rookie record in extra-base hits (53). He was second among rookies in Mets history with 33 doubles (behind Wigginton), his 19 home runs tied for second-most with Ron Swoboda (1965), behind &lt;a href=\"Darryl%20Strawberry\"&gt;Darryl Strawberry&lt;/a&gt; (1983), his 71 RBIs tied for second with Wigginton, behind Strawberry, and his 138 hits were 4th on the Mets all-time list (behind &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Payton\"&gt;Jay Payton&lt;/a&gt;\u20142000, &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Hunt\"&gt;Ron Hunt&lt;/a&gt;\u20141963, and Wigginton).\nDavis was named the first baseman on \"&lt;a href=\"Baseball%20America\"&gt;Baseball America&lt;/a&gt;\"'s 2010 All-Rookie Team. He came in 7th in the voting for 2010 &lt;a href=\"NL%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;NL Rookie of the Year&lt;/a&gt;, receiving two third-place votes.\n2011.\nDavis started the 2011 season by establishing a Mets record, with at least one RBI in 9 of his first 10 games. On May 10, he sustained a left ankle sprain and bone bruise, initially misdiagnosed by the Mets as a strained calf, in a collision with third baseman &lt;a href=\"David%20Wright%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;David Wright&lt;/a&gt;. The injury occurred on a routine popup near the pitcher's mound, with Davis rolling his ankle in an injury that didn't appear very serious at the time. On June 22, he was told that the injury might require season-ending surgery. On September 6, ESPN reported that Davis was rehabbing his ankle and would not need surgery.\nDuring his injury-shortened 2011 season, Davis batted .302 with a .925 OPS, in 139 at bats in 36 games. He hit 7 home runs, and had 25 RBIs.\nIn 2011, Davis also appeared on an episode of the fourth season of &lt;a href=\"MTV\"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;'s game show \"&lt;a href=\"Silent%20Library%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Silent Library&lt;/a&gt;\".\n2012.\nIn early March 2012, Davis was diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"valley%20fever\"&gt;valley fever&lt;/a&gt;, a rare dust-borne &lt;a href=\"Pathogenic%20fungi\"&gt;fungal&lt;/a&gt; infection endemic in the American southwest. The effects of it lingered with him for years.\nDavis started the season slowly, but then began hitting, getting one homer in each of three games of a four-game span in mid-April. On May 24, he had the second-lowest batting average (.159) of all qualified major leaguers. As of June 15, he had raised his batting average to .188. On June 18, Davis hit his first career &lt;a href=\"grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;grand slam&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Arrieta\"&gt;Jake Arrieta&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Orioles\"&gt;Orioles&lt;/a&gt;. The grand slam also extended his hitting streak to 9 games, and Davis hit .462 (12-for-26) during the span. After the hot streak Davis cooled and again struggled. Davis was ejected from a Major League game for the first time in his career on June 26, when he argued with umpire &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Gonzalez\"&gt;Manny Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Clevenger\"&gt;Steve Clevenger&lt;/a&gt; was ruled safe at first on a pickoff attempt. In June, he had 10 consecutive extra-base hits (five home runs and five doubles), the second-longest such streak in Mets history.\nOn July 28, Davis hit home runs in his first three at bats (all solo home runs) against the Arizona Diamondbacks' &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Kennedy\"&gt;Ian Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, eventually going 4-for-4 (adding a single in his final at bat). Davis became only the 9th Met in history to hit 3 home runs in one game. The 3 homers in one game were also a career high for Davis; with them he also reached 20 home runs for the season, breaking his prior year high of 19 home runs.\nHe ended the 2012 season with a .227 batting average, 32 home runs (5th in the National League), and 90 RBIs, as his home-run-every-16.2-at-bats was 3rd in the NL behind &lt;a href=\"Giancarlo%20Stanton\"&gt;Giancarlo Stanton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Braun\"&gt;Ryan Braun&lt;/a&gt;. He became the 16th Met to surpass 30 home runs in a season. On defense, his fielding percentage of .994 at first base was 5th-best in the league.\n2013.\nDavis struggled early in 2013 and became a subject of criticism for many Mets fans and sports analysts. In June, Davis was sent down to &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%2051s\"&gt;Triple-A Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; for 10 games, in which he batted .364. He was recalled in early July. He tied a team record set by &lt;a href=\"John%20Olerud\"&gt;John Olerud&lt;/a&gt; in 1998, by reaching base at least twice in 12 straight starts from July 29 \u2013 August 13. He recovered to hit .286 in the second half, with a .449 on-base percentage. For the season, he batted .205 with 9 home runs and 33 RBIs for the Mets, in 103 games.\n2014.\nDavis was the 2014 Opening Day starting first baseman for the Mets. Early in the season he was platooned with &lt;a href=\"Lucas%20Duda\"&gt;Lucas Duda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Satin\"&gt;Josh Satin&lt;/a&gt;. On April 4, Mets' manager &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Collins\"&gt;Terry Collins&lt;/a&gt; announced that Duda would get the bulk of the playing time at first base. On April 5, Davis hit a walk-off grand slam coming off the bench against the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt;.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn April 18, 2014, the Mets traded Davis to the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Zack%20Thornton\"&gt;Zack Thornton&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"player%20to%20be%20named%20later\"&gt;player to be named later&lt;/a&gt;, Blake Taylor. Davis hit another grand slam against the Reds on April 21, becoming the third player in MLB history to switch teams midseason and hit a grand slam against the same opponent (following &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boone\"&gt;Ray Boone&lt;/a&gt; in 1953, and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Piazza\"&gt;Mike Piazza&lt;/a&gt; in 1998), and the first player to hit grand slams for different teams in the same April. Overall, in Pittsburgh he hit .235 with 10 home runs and 46 RBIs in 336 at-bats, splitting time with Gaby Sanchez at first.\nFor the season, on defense he had the best &lt;a href=\"Range%20Factor\"&gt;Range Factor&lt;/a&gt;/9 Innings of all major league first basemen, at 10.59.

Davis in high school was 23\u20130 with a 1.85 ERA and was the Arizona High School Pitcher of the Year, and in college he had a 2.25 ERA as a pitcher. Against the Angels he threw his fastball as high as 88 miles per hour, threw a slider in the high 70s, and threw a cutter. It was the first time the A\u2019s had a position player pitch since &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Menechino\"&gt;Frank Menechino&lt;/a&gt; in 2000.\nOn August 21, 2015 it was announced Davis would undergo surgery to repair a torn hip labrum, ending his season.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn February 15, 2016, Davis signed a minor league contract with the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt;.

He was designated for assignment by the Yankees on June 25. Two days later, he was outrighted from the 40-man roster to the &lt;a href=\"Scranton/Wilkes-Barre%20RailRiders\"&gt;Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders&lt;/a&gt; of the Triple-A &lt;a href=\"International%20League\"&gt;International League&lt;/a&gt;.

He retired in November 2018.\nTeam Israel.\nDavis, although eligible to play for Israel at the 2013 World Baseball Classic was unable to participate in the qualifying round due to being an active player for the Mets.
