Players may transform at any time after the letter \"B\" appears in the \"Beast Indicator\" below the players' &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28gaming%29\"&gt;life energy indicators&lt;/a&gt;. The Beast Indicator appears blue when storing the energy needed for transforming. When the Beast Indicator is fully charged, the word \"BEAST\" appears, and the player can activate Beast Mode by pressing a certain button. During Beast Mode, the amount of fighting moves available to the character increases, the character becomes heavier, 3% of the character's life energy recovers and the character's jumping ability increases. While in Beast Mode, the Beast Indicator turns yellow. The yellow area decreases according to damage sustained by the character. The yellow area does not recharge during the current round.
