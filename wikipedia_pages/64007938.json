    "text": "The Alden 44 is an American &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt; that was designed by &lt;a href=\"Alden%20Associates\"&gt;Alden Associates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Niels%20Helleberg\"&gt;Niels Helleberg&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"International%20Offshore%20Rule\"&gt;International Offshore Rule&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sailing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;racer&lt;/a&gt; and first built in 1976.\nProduction.\nThe design was built by &lt;a href=\"Tillotson%20Pearson\"&gt;Tillotson Pearson&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Alden%20Yachts\"&gt;Alden Yachts&lt;/a&gt;, but it is now out of production.\nDesign.\nThe Alden 44 is a recreational &lt;a href=\"keelboat\"&gt;keelboat&lt;/a&gt;, built predominantly of &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt;, with wood trim. It has a &lt;a href=\"raked%20stem\"&gt;raked stem&lt;/a&gt;, a raised counter &lt;a href=\"reverse%20transom\"&gt;reverse transom&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"skeg\"&gt;skeg&lt;/a&gt;-mounted &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20wheel\"&gt;wheel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt; spars and a fixed stub fin &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt;, with a retractable &lt;a href=\"centerboard\"&gt;centerboard&lt;/a&gt;. It displaces and carries of lead ballast.\nThe boat has a variety of possible interior layouts, but typical is sleeping accommodation for seven people, with a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin, an \"L\"-shaped settee, with a drop-leaf table and a straight settee, plus a pilot berth in the main cabin and an aft cabin with two berths. The aft cabin has its own &lt;a href=\"companionway\"&gt;companionway&lt;/a&gt; ladder from the cockpit. The &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; is located on the starboard side beside the forward companionway ladder with the double sink located underneath the steps. The galley is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"propane\"&gt;propane&lt;/a&gt;-fired three-burner stove and oven as well as a refrigerator and a freezer. The large &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is located just forward of the aft cabin on the port side, with access from the aft cabin and the main cabin. It includes a shower. Main cabin trim is of &lt;a href=\"Fraxinus\"&gt;ash&lt;/a&gt; wood.\nVentilation is provided by five translucent hatches and seven opening ports.\nFor sailing the design is equipped with two &lt;a href=\"winch\"&gt;winch&lt;/a&gt;es for the main &lt;a href=\"halyard\"&gt;halyard&lt;/a&gt;, two for the &lt;a href=\"genoa%20%28sail%29\"&gt;genoa&lt;/a&gt; halyard, two for the &lt;a href=\"spinnaker\"&gt;spinnaker&lt;/a&gt; halyard and two for the &lt;a href=\"staysail\"&gt;staysail&lt;/a&gt; halyard, two primary and two secondary winches for the genoa &lt;a href=\"sheet%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;sheets&lt;/a&gt;, two for the staysail sheets, two for the &lt;a href=\"mainsheet\"&gt;mainsheet&lt;/a&gt;, two for the spinnaker sheets and one for the &lt;a href=\"outhaul\"&gt;outhaul&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the installed winches are self-tailing. The design also has a &lt;a href=\"topping%20lift\"&gt;topping lift&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperational history.\nIn a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \"The Alden [44] is designed for IOR competition but has many cruising amenities. The hull is moderate displacement. She is claimed to be fast, dry, stiff, and close-winded.\"\nReviewer Steve Knauth described the design in 2014, in \"Soundings\", \"the 44 was different from the old schooners, with its cutter rig, keel/centerboard and skeg-hung rudder. Yet it was perfectly in the Alden tradition of racing/cruising yachts. The boat could handle a crew of seven \u2014 enough for a Bermuda Race \u2014 and its competitive qualities were soon apparent. The Alden 44 quickly established a reputation for bluewater racing and passagemaking.\" He concludes that it \"remains one of the prettiest sailboats you'll see in any harbor.\"\nSee also.\nSimilar sailboats"
