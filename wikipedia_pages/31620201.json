He managed &lt;a href=\"Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Tranmere Rovers&lt;/a&gt; from 1912\u20131935, the longest spell of any manager at the club. He oversaw their first &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; match in 1921.\nManagement career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Birkenhead\"&gt;Birkenhead&lt;/a&gt; in 1882, Cooke became manager of Tranmere in 1912, and stayed in charge for 23 years, the longest spell of any manager at the club.\nIn 1919, Tranmere were promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Central%20League\"&gt;Central League&lt;/a&gt;. Within a year, &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North\"&gt;Division Three North&lt;/a&gt; was created and, in 1921, Cooke oversaw the club's first Football League match. A string of talented local youngsters were developed by Cooke before moving to &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; clubs - &lt;a href=\"Dixie%20Dean\"&gt;Dixie Dean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ellis%20Rimmer\"&gt;Ellis Rimmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Waring\"&gt;Pongo Waring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Ridding\"&gt;Nibbler Ridding&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1934\u201335 season \u2013 Cooke's last in charge \u2013 Rovers led Division Three North for most of the campaign but, in the last few weeks, blew their promotion chance. They did however win the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Cup\"&gt;Welsh Cup&lt;/a&gt; that year. He left under acrimonious circumstances, amid &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20Association\"&gt;FA&lt;/a&gt; enquiries into illegal payments to players to induce them to sign for Rovers and the dismissal of several directors. Cooke was replaced by former England international, &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Carr%20%28footballer%20born%201892%29\"&gt;Jackie Carr&lt;/a&gt;.\nCooke died in &lt;a href=\"Wirral%20Urban%20District\"&gt;Wirral&lt;/a&gt; in 1959, aged 76."
