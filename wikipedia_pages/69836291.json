In 1883 he was &lt;a href=\"municipal%20president\"&gt;municipal president&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ocampo%20Municipality%2C%20Chihuahua\"&gt;Ocampo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chihuahua%20%28state%29\"&gt;Chihuahua&lt;/a&gt;, after Sonoran Governor Ignacio Pesqueira banished him from Sonora in 1873, for having taken up arms against him.\nFamily.\nA son of the &lt;a href=\"Americans\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; Charles Rich Conant and the &lt;a href=\"Mexicans\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; Simona Maldonado, Charles \"Carlos\" Conant Maldonado was born on 20 January 1842 in Guaymas, Sonora. As a teenager he had an entrepreneurial spirit. He married Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montijo, and they had six daughters and two sons.\nMilitary period.\nA supporter of General &lt;a href=\"Porfirio%20D%C3%ADaz\"&gt;Porfirio D\u00edaz&lt;/a&gt; since a few days after he launched his \"&lt;a href=\"Plan%20de%20la%20Noria\"&gt;Plan de la Noria&lt;/a&gt;\", on 8 November 1871, Colonel Conant supported without hesitation the proclamation and the call to take up arms against the government of the reelected &lt;a href=\"President%20%28government%20title%29\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Ju%C3%A1rez\"&gt;Benito Ju\u00e1rez&lt;/a&gt; according to the final ruling of 7 October 1871 by the scrutinizing commission of the &lt;a href=\"1871%20Mexican%20general%20election\"&gt;1871 Mexican general election&lt;/a&gt;.\nBusiness history.\nFrom a young age he was very hardworking. He devoted himself to &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; on his &lt;a href=\"hacienda\"&gt;hacienda&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Huatabampo%20Municipality\"&gt;Huatabampo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sonora\"&gt;Sonora&lt;/a&gt;, which he lost when took up arms against Governor Ignacio Pesqueira, after proclamation of his Plan of the Promontories, on 2 September 1873, for which he was exiled from Sonora for ten years.\nMining businessman and municipal president of Ocampo, Chihuahua.\nIn the aforementioned year of 1873 he settled in the mineral of &lt;a href=\"Ocampo%20Municipality%2C%20Chihuahua\"&gt;Ocampo&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Federated%20state\"&gt;State&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chihuahua%20%28state%29\"&gt;Chihuahua&lt;/a&gt;, very close to the Sonoran municipality of &lt;a href=\"Y%C3%A9cora%2C%20Sonora\"&gt;Y\u00e9cora&lt;/a&gt;. He was a shareholder of the Santa Juliana Mining Company, and &lt;a href=\"municipal%20president\"&gt;municipal president&lt;/a&gt; of Ocampo. With this position, he arrived on 22 January 1883 in the town of Pinos Altos (\"High Pines\"), where he suffocated a &lt;a href=\"Strike%20action\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"miner\"&gt;miner&lt;/a&gt;s and had three workers shot in the Las Lajas neighborhood: Blas Venegas, Cruz Baca, and Ramon Mena. Two or three hours later, the political chief Ram\u00f3n Campos arrived in the town and ordered the execution of two labor leaders, promoters of the strike: Juan Valenzuela and Francisco Campos.\nReturn to Sonora.\nIn 1888 he sold his shares in the &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;mining sector&lt;/a&gt; and returned to Sonora.\nUpon learning that the &lt;a href=\"Porfiriato\"&gt;Porfiriato&lt;/a&gt; government (the long term of &lt;a href=\"General%20officer\"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Porfirio%20D%C3%ADaz\"&gt;Porfirio D\u00edaz&lt;/a&gt; in office) began to grant concessions for the use of the waters of various rivers, giving ownership of the demarcated land in exchange for the cost of the technical work and construction of the works for the irrigation of those lands, presented his project for the southern region of Sonora called &lt;a href=\"Valle%20del%20Yaqui\"&gt;Valle del Yaqui&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 22 August 1890, by means of a contract signed by Conant and &lt;a href=\"General\"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt; , Secretary of Development, Colonization and Industry of the regime of Porfirio D\u00edaz, the Federal Government granted the concession to open 300\u00a0000 hectares of land (741\u00a0290 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s) for cultivation and open &lt;a href=\"irrigation\"&gt;irrigation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"canal\"&gt;canal&lt;/a&gt;s taking advantage of the waters of the &lt;a href=\"Yaqui%20River\"&gt;Yaqui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mayo%20River%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;Mayo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s, in the State of Sonora, and the &lt;a href=\"Fuerte%20River\"&gt;Fuerte River&lt;/a&gt; in the State of Sinaloa. The approval of the contract was published four months later, on 22 December 1890.\nConant undertook the first demarcations on the Yaqui River lands, with his own resources, those of his brother Benito and those of fellow shareholder Santos Valenzuela, but the magnitude of the project required more financing. He traveled to New York and formed the Sonora-Sinaloa Irrigation Company, partnering with &lt;a href=\"Americans\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"investor\"&gt;investor&lt;/a&gt;s, to found a company that was integrated by Walter Logan, as president and treasurer; Carlos Conant as vice president and general manager; Salter S. Clark as secretary, and Z.O. Stoeker as &lt;a href=\"civil%20engineer\"&gt;civil engineer&lt;/a&gt;. With the above, this businessman born in &lt;a href=\"Guaymas\"&gt;Guaymas&lt;/a&gt; became one of the first &lt;a href=\"settler\"&gt;settler&lt;/a&gt;s of the now fertile &lt;a href=\"Valle%20del%20Yaqui\"&gt;Valle del Yaqui&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction of floodgates and canals in the Yaqui Valley.\nThe company concentrated its activities on the demarcation of land in the Yaqui Valley and on the works of the Canal Principal (Main Canal) that would irrigate those lands, with an estimated investment of 12 million dollars. The floodgate of the Main Canal was located on the left bank of the river, in front of the place called Los Hornos. At the end of 1890 this work began and a steam dredge was bought in Chicago, to join the excavation of the Main Canal, which had already begun before with people and implements transported by &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;s. Its construction concluded in 1896.\nIn 1904 there was an extraordinary flood of the Yaqui River that destroyed part of the channeling works and the crops.\nDeath.\nBy 1905, Conant, the pioneer of irrigated agriculture in Southern Sonora, retired to his hometown of Guaymas, where he died on 5 February 1907.\nTribute.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ciudad%20Obreg%C3%B3n\"&gt;Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; a street bears &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Carlos%2BConant%2BMaldonado%2C%2B85160%2BCd%2BObreg%25C3%25B3n%2C%2BSon./%4027.4817424%2C-109.9326774%2C18z/data%3D%214m5%213m4%211s0x86c815e17e5a9309%3A0x69b9349f524183ea%218m2%213d27.4817424%214d-109.9315831\"&gt;his name&lt;/a&gt;."
