    "text": "Penarth Lifeboat Station is located in &lt;a href=\"Penarth\"&gt;Penarth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Glamorgan\"&gt;Vale of Glamorgan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; and originally opened in 1861.\nThe station was closed in 1905 with services transferred to other local stations, until 1980 when the station reopened on Penarth seafront with an inshore lifeboat. The station currently operates an lifeboat and a lifeboat.\nHistory.\nThe Bristol Channel has always been a hazardous stretch of water because of the extreme tidal range. There are very strong currents or rips close inshore, with speeds that exceed 7\u00a0&lt;a href=\"knot%20%28unit%29\"&gt;knot&lt;/a&gt;s (13\u00a0km/h), for several hours at each tide. The rise and fall of the tides at Penarth are the second highest recorded anywhere in the world The original 1861 oar-powered lifeboat was housed in a shed built near to where Penarth Yacht Club now stands at the southern end of Penarth beach and controlled by staff located at the Coastguard cottages and Trinity House lookout tower on Tower Hill near Marine Parade.\nThe manually powered (&lt;a href=\"Watercraft%20rowing\"&gt;rowing&lt;/a&gt;) or \"pulling boats\" were 30 feet in length and were powered by 12 &lt;a href=\"oar\"&gt;oar&lt;/a&gt;s. They had &lt;a href=\"Cork%20%28material%29\"&gt;cork&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; and shaped air-cases fore and aft. The boats were self-righting and their double-ended designs could operate a rudder from either end, so there was no need to turn. \nIn 1883 when the Yacht Club and the raised concrete esplanade were constructed along Penarth seafront an all-weather lifeboat was relocated to a yard and temporary slipway near the Taff Vale Railway\u2019s Marine Hotel on the Dock Beach where it remained until 1905.\nThe Penarth lifeboat was withdrawn from service in 1905 and all services transferred to the new &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Dock%20Lifeboat%20Station\"&gt;Barry Dock Lifeboat Station&lt;/a&gt; and the station at &lt;a href=\"Weston-super-Mare%20Lifeboat%20Station\"&gt;Weston-super-mare&lt;/a&gt;. Penarth would have no lifeboat service for the next 75 years until a new station opened in 1980.\nWith the regular daily hovercraft service between Penarth to Weston-super-mare, coupled with an increase in leisure boating generated by a new water skiing club, in 1980 it was decided to re-establish lifeboat services at Penarth with the provision of an inflatable inshore lifeboat. The new boat was located at the original site next to Penarth Yacht Club, housed in an unused storehouse and launched down the yacht club\u2019s jetty.\nThe current boathouse was built in 1995 to house a B class lifeboat. Also provided were a &lt;a href=\"Talus%20MB-4H%20amphibious%20tractor\"&gt;Talus MB-4H&lt;/a&gt; launching tractor, a workshop, an RNLI souvenir shop, a fuel store and improved crew facilities. The following year an Atlantic 21 class lifeboat arrived for a temporary duty at the station. That boat was replaced four months later by the \"Atlantic 75\"-class and the \"D\"-class . The \"D\"-class lifeboat is launched using a &lt;a href=\"RNLI%20New%20Holland%20TC45%20launch%20tractor\"&gt;TC45 tractor&lt;/a&gt; and carriage.\nIn 2010 \"Spirit of Penarth\" was withdrawn from service and replaced with an \nStation Honours.\nFramed Letter of Thanks - 2002\nThanks of the Institute inscribed on Vellum - 2012"
