His ban was lifted in 2015.\nOn 15 February 2016, however, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dutch%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Royal Dutch Football Association&lt;/a&gt; reported it had found evidence of Kargbo being actively involved in match fixing, specifically in a match against FC Utrecht on 9 August 2009 (which Willem II lost 1\u20130). Kargbo is now banned from playing football in the Netherlands.\nIn April 2019, &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; banned Kargbo for life from all footballing activities due to &lt;a href=\"Match%20fixing%20in%20association%20football\"&gt;\"match manipulation\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nHis son &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20Kargbo%20Jr.\"&gt;Ibrahim Kargbo Jr.&lt;/a&gt; is also a footballer."
