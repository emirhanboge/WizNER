    "text": "Zwingenberg lies in the &lt;a href=\"Kreis%20Bergstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Bergstra\u00dfe district&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Hessen\"&gt;Hessen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darmstadt\"&gt;Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt;, and with the granting of town rights coming in 1274 it is the oldest town on the Hessen &lt;a href=\"Bergstra%C3%9Fe%20%28district%29\"&gt;Bergstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nZwingenberg lies on the western edge of the &lt;a href=\"Odenwald\"&gt;Odenwald&lt;/a&gt; at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Melibokus\"&gt;Melibokus&lt;/a&gt;, at 517.4\u00a0m above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt; the Bergstra\u00dfe's highest mountain. The municipal area's elevation varies between roughly 90\u00a0m above sea level in the outlying centre of Rodau and just under 300\u00a0m on the slope of the Melibokus. Zwingenberg's highest elevation is no one single mountain. Rather, it runs along the Melibokus's slope into the area of Auerbach, an outlying centre of &lt;a href=\"Bensheim\"&gt;Bensheim&lt;/a&gt;. The 100-metre marker at Zwingenberg &lt;a href=\"railway%20station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt; is taken to be the standard. In the west, Zwingenberg abuts the \"Hessisches Ried\", and thereby the &lt;a href=\"Rhine%20rift\"&gt;Rhine rift&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Zwingenberg's west, towards Rodau and in Rodau itself, cropraising and meadows prevail. Only a small patch of woodland belongs to the municipal area near the &lt;a href=\"Niederwaldsee\"&gt;Niederwaldsee&lt;/a&gt; (lake). In Zwingenberg there still exist remnants of, and even new fruit farming (mainly &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s). On the outlying hills of the Orbish\u00f6he (heights) and towards Luciberg is found &lt;a href=\"winegrowing\"&gt;winegrowing&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, &lt;a href=\"almond\"&gt;almond&lt;/a&gt; trees grow in the region. A narrower line of woodland in the municipal area can still be found in the area of the Morgenruhe foundry and running by way of Blockh\u00fctte towards Comoder Weg. Remains of &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quarry\"&gt;quarry&lt;/a&gt;ing can also still be made out.\nUnder the windbreak afforded by the Melibokus, a &lt;a href=\"microclimate\"&gt;microclimate&lt;/a&gt; holds sway, which can in places near the slope lead to less &lt;a href=\"precipitation%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;precipitation&lt;/a&gt; than is found, for example, on the plain.\nNeighbouring communities.\nZwingenberg lies between the community of &lt;a href=\"Alsbach-H%C3%A4hnlein\"&gt;Alsbach-H\u00e4hnlein&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darmstadt-Dieburg\"&gt;Darmstadt-Dieburg&lt;/a&gt; in the north and the town of &lt;a href=\"Bensheim\"&gt;Bensheim&lt;/a&gt; in Bergstra\u00dfe district in the south. In the west Bensheim's outlying centres of Fehlheim and Langwaden border on the outlying centre of Rodau. In the east Zwingenberg borders on the Melibokus, whose peak lies in the area of Auerbach, an outlying centre of &lt;a href=\"Bensheim\"&gt;Bensheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstituent communities.\nZwingenberg is made up of the two centres of Zwingenberg with an area of 346 hectares, and Rodau with an area of 215 hectares.\nPopulation development.\nAs of 31 December 1971, the population figures include Rodau.\nHistory.\n\u201cAbout when or by whom this town was built there is no information. That it is an ancient town can be gathered from all facts.\u201d The earliest mention of \"locum getwinc\" is a document from 1015 in which Emperor &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Heinrich II&lt;/a&gt; donated hunting rights to the &lt;a href=\"Lorsch%20Abbey\"&gt;Lorsch Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. The placename Zwingenberg refers to how travellers on the Bergstra\u00dfe were \"forced\" (in &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; \"gezwungen\"; infinitive \"zwingen\") to pass through the town's gates by the &lt;a href=\"wetland\"&gt;wetland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Riparian%20zone\"&gt;lowland forest&lt;/a&gt; that lay west of town.\nThrough his marriage to &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Henneberg\"&gt;Hildegard von Henneberg&lt;/a&gt;, Henry II of Katzenelnbogen, whom &lt;a href=\"Conrad%20III%20of%20Germany\"&gt;King Konrad III&lt;/a&gt; raised to Count in 1138, had parts of the &lt;a href=\"Bergstra%C3%9Fe%20Route\"&gt;Bergstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt; pass to him about 1135. Zwingenberg now belonged to the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Katzenelnbogen\"&gt;County of Katzenelnbogen&lt;/a&gt; with its seat at the &lt;a href=\"Katzenelnbogen\"&gt;like-named town&lt;/a&gt;. The county was divided into upper and lower halves, with the former lying on the Rhine around &lt;a href=\"Sankt%20Goar\"&gt;Sankt Goar&lt;/a&gt; and the latter in southern Hessen.\nTo guard his southern holdings on the Bergstra\u00dfe and his toll income, Count Diether IV built a lower castle in Zwingenberg and a high castle, the &lt;a href=\"Auerbach%20Castle\"&gt;Auerbacher Schloss&lt;/a&gt;, above Auerbach.\nIn 1258, Diether V received the right to build a church in Zwingenberg:\nIn 1260, the county was partitioned between Diether V and his brother Eberhard I, with Diether taking Zwingenberg and Eberhard Auerbach.\nZwingenberg was granted town and market rights under Count Diether V and King &lt;a href=\"Rudolph%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Rudolf of Habsburg&lt;/a&gt;, thereby becoming the oldest town on the Bergstra\u00dfe.\nIn 1301, Zwingenberg was destroyed and went up in flames. Count Wilhelm I of Katzenelnbogen, Diether V's son, had allied himself with four Rhenish electors and raised tolls on the Rhine, the upshot to which was damage to free trade and a declaration of war from King Albrecht I. The Lower Castle was destroyed, too.\nIn 1330, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Louis%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Louis the Bavarian&lt;/a&gt; confirmed to Count Wilhelm I Zwingenberg's town rights:\nIn 1355, Wilhelm II took wedding vows with Elisabeth of Hanau. This involved providing for her in her widowhood with, among other things, a widow's seat for her in &lt;a href=\"Darmstadt\"&gt;Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1401, the town's name was catalogued as \"Twinginburg\".\nIn 1403, Count Johann IV Katzenelnbogen an Henne Wei\u00dfkreis von Lindenfels pledged the castle and town of Zwingenberg with the villages of Eschollbr\u00fccken \u2013 which the Count owned \u2013 Pfungstadt and Nieder-Ramstadt with all rights and appurtenances for 6,000 Gulden, which the Count later redeemed.\nIn 1454, Count Philipp I of Katzenlenbogen agreed that Hans IV of Wallbrunn (whose seat was Wallbrunn) should provide a widowhood estate for his wife Lucie von Reifenberg consisting of, among other things, the house and a number of gardens at Zwingenberg, which Hans held from the Count as a fief, although without the military service obligation.\nUntil 1479, Zwingenberg belonged to the County of Katzenelnbogen, thereafter to the &lt;a href=\"Landgraviate%20of%20Hessen\"&gt;Landgraviate of Hessen&lt;/a&gt;, and as of 1567 to the &lt;a href=\"Landgraviate%20of%20Hessen-Darmstadt\"&gt;Landgraviate of Hessen-Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt;, which in 1806 was raised to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Hessen\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Hessen&lt;/a&gt;.\nOwing to the abandonments during the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt; and shortly thereafter the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20%28disease%29\"&gt;Plague&lt;/a&gt;, the town was for decades almost uninhabited, and eventually, a fire set by &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; troops in 1693 destroyed most of the houses. Only after the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt; did the town recover.\nIn 1832, Zwingenberg was grouped into the Bensheim district, and as of 1938 it belonged to &lt;a href=\"Kreis%20Bergstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Bergstra\u00dfe district&lt;/a&gt;. In the time of &lt;a href=\"National%20Socialism\"&gt;National Socialism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;s and the Nazis\u2019 political foes were driven out and deported. By chance, the &lt;a href=\"synagogue\"&gt;synagogue&lt;/a&gt; was not destroyed. It is nowadays used as a house. There is a club that has made it its business to revive the synagogue. In 1941, a &lt;a href=\"prisoner-of-war%20camp\"&gt;prisoner-of-war camp&lt;/a&gt; was set up at the youth hostel.\nOn 31 December 1971, Rodau was amalgamated with Zwingenberg.\nPolitics.\nTown council.\nThe composition of the town council after the four latest municipal elections:\nMayors.\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Dieter Kullak (independent) held office. At the election on 25 March 2007, in which Kullak was not a candidate, Holger Habich (FDP, but also supported by the CDU) was victorious. He was re-elected in 2013 and 2019.\nCoat of arms.\nThe town's &lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;arms&lt;/a&gt; might be described thus: Party per fess Or a lion rampant gules armed and langued azure and azure three &lt;a href=\"Seeblatt\"&gt;waterlily leaves&lt;/a&gt; argent.\nThe red lion rampant is from the arms borne by the old Counts of Katzenelnbogen. This same &lt;a href=\"charge%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt; can also be seen in &lt;a href=\"Darmstadt\"&gt;Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s, &lt;a href=\"Pfungstadt\"&gt;Pfungstadt&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s and Auerbach\u2019s arms, and they are all parted per pale (that is, horizontally across the middle), just as Zwingenberg\u2019s arms are.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nAlthough the economy was formerly largely based on &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and winegrowing, as well as &lt;a href=\"gastronomy\"&gt;gastronomy&lt;/a&gt;, since then, besides a great number of commercial enterprises, a series of smaller and midsize technology businesses has arisen.\nTransport.\nZwingenberg is linked to the &lt;a href=\"Bundesautobahn%205\"&gt;A\u00a05&lt;/a&gt; (Frankfurt-Basel) by &lt;a href=\"interchange%20%28road%29\"&gt;interchange&lt;/a&gt; 29, and Zwingenberg is also signposted on the &lt;a href=\"Bundesautobahn%2067\"&gt;A\u00a067&lt;/a&gt; at the Gernsheim interchange (8). &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20Airport\"&gt;Frankfurt Airport&lt;/a&gt; is 45\u00a0km away, and the riverport at &lt;a href=\"Gernsheim\"&gt;Gernsheim&lt;/a&gt; on the Rhine is 12\u00a0km away.\nParallel to the Odenwald runs the &lt;a href=\"Bergstra%C3%9Fe%20Route\"&gt;Bergstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%203\"&gt;federal highway B 3&lt;/a&gt;), which in Zwingenberg splits into the \u201cNew\u201d and \u201cOld\u201d Bergstra\u00dfe, which come back together again near Darmstadt-Eberstadt.\nThe relief road originally planned for the B\u00a03, called the \"Berliner Ring\", is open in parts. The road, running parallel to the B\u00a03, comes from Bensheim and leads back to the B\u00a03 in Zwingenberg. Original plans to relieve the (very low \u2013 about 2.95\u00a0m) railway bridge by building another bridge farther north failed in the face of protests from residents and the neighbouring community through whose municipal area parts of the road would have run.\nOne of Germany's most heavily travelled railways, the &lt;a href=\"Main-Neckar%20Railway\"&gt;Main-Neckar Railway&lt;/a&gt; (Frankfurt-Darmstadt-Heidelberg/Mannheim), runs through Zwingenberg. &lt;a href=\"Zwingenberg%20%28Bergstra%C3%9Fe%29%20station\"&gt;Zwingenberg station&lt;/a&gt; is served hourly by &lt;a href=\"Regionalbahn\"&gt;Regionalbahn&lt;/a&gt; trains. These are reinforced by other trains in rush hours.\nModern bus links of busline 669 run by Darmstadt's HEAG mobilo link the town with &lt;a href=\"Seeheim-Jugenheim\"&gt;Jugenheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heppenheim\"&gt;Heppenheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeisure and sport facilities.\nZwingenberg has at its disposal a small sporting ground with grass and a complete athletics facility, a paved ground and a field. Moreover, there are several tennis courts and two sport halls. Rodau likewise has a grass playing field.\nFor 2015, there are plans to build a modern sport park in which all locally played sports will be represented.\nCulture and sightseeing.\nZwingenberg lies on the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Odenwald\"&gt;Odenwald&lt;/a&gt; on the heights of the &lt;a href=\"Melibokus\"&gt;Melibokus&lt;/a&gt; on a relatively steep slope. The surrounding town wall is to a great extent still visible.\nThe \"Obergasse\" (\u201cUpper Lane\u201d) is the old \"getwinc\", the thoroughfare that led through the town's lower and upper gates. The street's alignment was only slightly changed after the fire of 1693 and still more or less shows the position of the old Bergstra\u00dfe.\nThe \u201cNew Pass\u201d was until the 15th century still wetland. Today the B\u00a03 runs here along the historic town wall through town. Between \"Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen\" and \"Neugasse\" the remains of the town wall form the back walls of the houses and barns on \"Untergasse\" (\u201cLower Lane\u201d)\nIncluding the outlying centre of Rodau, Zwingenberg has 81 cultural monuments under monumental protection.\nBuildings.\nThe town has a touristically attractive Old Town with &lt;a href=\"Timber%20framing\"&gt;timber-frame&lt;/a&gt; houses that are interesting both as buildings and as the history that they represent, a mountain church (\"Bergkirche\") and a former castle seat, enfeoffed by Johann von Katzenelnbogen to Hans von Wallbrunn the Elder in 1420.\nAt Zwingenberg's highest spot stands today's &lt;a href=\"youth%20hostel\"&gt;youth hostel&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"tithe\"&gt;tithe&lt;/a&gt; barn built on a &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s foundation. Of the round corner towers of the upper town wall, only the \"Aul\" has been preserved. It is the northeast tower, a two-floor tower made of undressed quarrystones.\nThe remains of the &lt;a href=\"moat\"&gt;moat&lt;/a&gt;ed &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; may well be Zwingenberg\u2019s oldest building. Outwards from this about 1250, the town fortifications took shape. The \u201cNew Marketplace\u201d arose at the beginning of the 17th century on the former moated castle's lands and the moat itself.\nThe old \"Amtsgericht\" (\u201c\"&lt;a href=\"Amt%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;Amt&lt;/a&gt;\" court\u201d) was built between 1561 and 1563 and restored in 1989. It originally served the Hessian landgraves as a hunting palace.\nThe \"Schl\u00f6\u00dfchen\" (\u201cLittle Palace\u201d), built about 1520, has served the town since 1969 as the Town Hall. Next to it stands the former guesthouse \"Zum L\u00f6wen\" (\u201cTo the Lion\u201d). It was built in 1595 and is the oldest building in existence outside the old town wall. Across the street from it lies the \"Scheuergasse\" (lane) formed by two rows of side-gabled barns. These were built outside the old town wall owing to the danger from fire, and today are used mainly as dwellings, offices and guesthouses.\nThe vaulted cellar under the \"Alte Apotheke\" (\u201cOld Apothecary\u2019s Shop\u201d), which stands on the marketplace, seems to go back to the time when the town wall was built. Later, the \"Alte Apotheke\" was known as \"gro\u00dfherzogliche Apotheke von Katzenellenbogen\" (the first word meaning \u201cGrand-Ducal\u201d), and was built in 1783.\nWine and culinary specialities.\nZwingenberg is part of the small winegrowing region of &lt;a href=\"Hessische%20Bergstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Hessische Bergstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt; which is known for herb wines. On the slopes of the Melibokus lie, within the \"Auerbacher Rott\" growing region, the locations of \"Zwingenberger Steinger\u00f6ll\" and \"Zwingenberger Alte Burg\". Abutting them to the north is the location of \"Alsbacher Sch\u00f6ntal\". White grape varieties grown here include &lt;a href=\"Sylvaner\"&gt;Sylvaner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riesling\"&gt;Riesling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCller-Thurgau\"&gt;M\u00fcller-Thurgau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morio%20Muscat\"&gt;Morio Muscat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Asparagus\"&gt;Asparagus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"strawberry\"&gt;strawberry&lt;/a&gt; farming characterize the flatter areas towards Rodau. Typical for Zwingenberg, therefore, are a robust dry &lt;a href=\"Riesling\"&gt;Riesling&lt;/a&gt; and mellow asparagus dishes.\nTheatre.\nIn the vaulted cellar under the former \"Amtsgericht\" is found the \"Theater Mobile\", which puts on its own and others\u2019 productions mainly in the fields of music, reading, children's theatre, dance and cabaret.\nMuseums.\nThe \"Heimatmuseum\" (local history) on historic Scheuergasse shows old handicrafts and historically decorated rooms.\nIn June 2005, the information centre \"Bl\u00fcten, Stein &amp; Wein\" (\u201cBlossoms, Stone and Wine\u201d) of the UNESCO \"Geopark Bergstra\u00dfe-Odenwald\" opened at the community centre \"Bunter L\u00f6we\" (\u201cColourful Lion\u201d). The information centre, which is open at weekends and after notification, also houses the tourist information centre.\nFamous people.\nHonorary citizens.\nThe town's first honorary citizen was the Reverend Adam H\u00f6fle (1900\u20131999)."
