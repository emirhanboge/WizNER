After the Ingush population were allowed to return from the deportation, the Georgian inhabitants returned to Georgia. \nThe name \"Tamariani\" translates from &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20language\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt; \"[the place] where Tamara was\". A settlement with the same name exists in &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;."
