    "text": "Herschel McCoy (August 6, 1912 \u2013 February 3, 1956) was an American motion picture &lt;a href=\"costume%20designer\"&gt;costume designer&lt;/a&gt; with credits on more than 150 feature films from 1936 to 1955. He was nominated twice for the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Costume%20Design\"&gt;Academy Award for Best Costume Design&lt;/a&gt;.\nMcCoy's early efforts were largely focused on &lt;a href=\"B%20movies\"&gt;B movies&lt;/a&gt;, such as several entries in the &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Chan\"&gt;Charlie Chan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Moto\"&gt;Mr. Moto&lt;/a&gt; canons. He had just graduated to major studio productions like an uncredited assist on \"&lt;a href=\"Joan%20of%20Arc%20%281948%20film%29\"&gt;Joan of Arc&lt;/a&gt;\" (1948), \"&lt;a href=\"Quo%20Vadis%20%281951%20film%29\"&gt;Quo Vadis&lt;/a&gt;\" (1951), and \"&lt;a href=\"Dream%20Wife\"&gt;Dream Wife&lt;/a&gt;\" (1953) when he died suddenly in 1956 at the age of 43. For the last two films, McCoy was nominated for the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Costume%20Design\"&gt;Academy Award for Best Costume Design&lt;/a&gt;.\nMcCoy's drawings for twenty-two of his designs are in the collection of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Los Angeles County Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;."
