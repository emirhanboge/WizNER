But he's also produced works in cities such as &lt;a href=\"Bangkok\"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mombasa\"&gt;Mombasa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phnom%20Penh\"&gt;Phnom Penh&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2011 he did one of his last self organised shows at the &lt;a href=\"Tuol%20Sleng\"&gt;Tuol Sleng&lt;/a&gt;, S21 the former Khmer Rouge prison (Cambodia). In honour of the victims of the &lt;a href=\"Khmer%20Rouge\"&gt;Khmer Rouge&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s terror and genocide that took place from 1975 to 1979 in Cambodia, Peter Klashorst created an impressive and sometimes very confronting set of around 50 paintings. The show got world wide attention (&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; and Herald Tribune)."
