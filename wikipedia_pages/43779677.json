    "title": "Active sound design",
    "text": "Active sound design is an &lt;a href=\"Acoustics\"&gt;acoustic&lt;/a&gt; technology concept used in &lt;a href=\"Motor%20vehicle\"&gt;automotive vehicles&lt;/a&gt; to alter or enhance the &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt; inside and outside of the vehicle. Active sound design (ASD) often uses &lt;a href=\"active%20noise%20control\"&gt;active noise control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"acoustic%20enhancement\"&gt;acoustic enhancement&lt;/a&gt; techniques to achieve a synthesized vehicle sound.\nThe typical implementations of ASD vary, from amplifying or reducing an existing sound to creating an entirely new sound. Each vehicle manufacturer may use different &lt;a href=\"software\"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Electronic%20hardware\"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt; techniques in ASD, as there is no one unified model. ASD exists under multiple names, like Acura\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.autobytel.com/car-ownership/technology/what-is-acura-active-sound-control-125813/\"&gt;Active Sound Control&lt;/a&gt;, Kia\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.kia.com/worldwide/KiaBuzz/Stories/View.do%3FSEQ%3D23\"&gt;Active Sound System&lt;/a&gt;, Volkswagen\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Soundaktor\"&gt;Soundaktor&lt;/a&gt;, and QNX\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https%3A//blackberry.qnx.com/en/products/acoustic/sound-design\"&gt;Acoustic Management System&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first instance of in-vehicle active noise cancelling (ANC) was developed by &lt;a href=\"Lotus%20Cars\"&gt;Lotus&lt;/a&gt; and featured in the 1992 &lt;a href=\"Nissan%20Bluebird\"&gt;Nissan Bluebird&lt;/a&gt;. In 2009, Lotus partnered with &lt;a href=\"Harman%20International\"&gt;Harman International&lt;/a&gt; for an improved ANC system that eliminated noise from the road, tires, and vehicle &lt;a href=\"chassis\"&gt;chassis&lt;/a&gt;. With recent demand for economical and cleaner &lt;a href=\"Internal%20combustion%20engine\"&gt;combustion engine&lt;/a&gt; vehicles, &lt;a href=\"engine\"&gt;engine&lt;/a&gt; systems have become more efficient but less audibly appealing to consumers. &lt;a href=\"Electric%20vehicle\"&gt;Electric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fuel%20cell%20vehicle\"&gt;fuel cell vehicle&lt;/a&gt;s operate with high-pitched &lt;a href=\"Musical%20tone\"&gt;tones&lt;/a&gt;, lacking the recognizable sound of a typical combustion engine. With ASD, both combustion and electrical vehicle manufacturers aim to improve the reception of these vehicles by increasing the quality of interior and exterior vehicle sound.\nComponents.\nActive noise cancelling (ANC) is a &lt;a href=\"software\"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; process that uses existing &lt;a href=\"In-car%20entertainment\"&gt;in-vehicle infotainment&lt;/a&gt; hardware to eliminate undesirable &lt;a href=\"noise\"&gt;noise&lt;/a&gt; within the interior of a vehicle. This elimination technique is known as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.ecmweb.com/content/article/20897096/fundamentals-of-harmonics%23%3A~%3Atext%3DWe%2520define%2520harmonics%2520as%2520voltages%2C%252C%2520200%2520Hz%252C%2520etc.%29\"&gt;harmonic order&lt;/a&gt; reduction, where unwanted &lt;a href=\"audio%20signal\"&gt;audio signal&lt;/a&gt;s are identified by &lt;a href=\"sensor\"&gt;sensor&lt;/a&gt;s and filtered out of the overall interior vehicle sound. Manufacturers may use ANC within a vehicle to improve the effects of ASD.\nEngine sound enhancement (ESE) is a &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; that allows manufacturers to &lt;a href=\"Acoustic%20enhancement\"&gt;enhance&lt;/a&gt; engine sounds with synthetic noise composed from live engine &lt;a href=\"data\"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, including components such as engine &lt;a href=\"Revolutions%20per%20minute\"&gt;revolutions per minute (RPM)&lt;/a&gt; and engine &lt;a href=\"torque\"&gt;torque&lt;/a&gt;. This synthetically composed sound is relayed through interior or exterior vehicle &lt;a href=\"Loudspeaker\"&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt;. In ASD, manufacturers may use ESE to enhance perceived &lt;a href=\"engine%20power\"&gt;engine power&lt;/a&gt; without the mechanical alterations that other techniques may require.\nMotivations for ASD.\nIn the face of &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20protection\"&gt;environmental restrictions&lt;/a&gt; and a demand for &lt;a href=\"Fuel%20economy%20in%20automobiles\"&gt;fuel economy&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"automotive%20industry\"&gt;automotive industry&lt;/a&gt;, smaller engine &lt;a href=\"System\"&gt;subsystems&lt;/a&gt; have made interior vehicle noise less pleasant in combustion engine vehicles. Electric and &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20vehicle\"&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt; vehicles lack a distinct engine sound altogether, instead featuring a quieter &lt;a href=\"high%20frequency\"&gt;high frequency&lt;/a&gt; noise that causes annoyance for vehicle passengers and poses a threat to pedestrians who may not recognize an oncoming vehicle. These developments have sparked a consumer demand for a more desirable interior sound, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Brand\"&gt;brand identity&lt;/a&gt; in both the interior and exterior of the vehicle that is recognizable and mitigates safety risks.\nTraditional iterations of sound control in vehicles included tedious mechanical alterations such as &lt;a href=\"balance%20shaft\"&gt;balance shaft&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Absorption%20%28acoustics%29\"&gt;sound-deadening&lt;/a&gt; material that increased manufacturing time and cost. With the renewal of sound design in the form of ASD, manufacturing costs and complications are reduced. Instead of integrating the technology into the engine structure, the sound can be fixed at a later stage of development and optimized to the vehicle.\nVariations.\nActive sound design (ASD) takes &lt;a href=\"Input/output\"&gt;inputs&lt;/a&gt; from engine and vehicle &lt;a href=\"speed\"&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt;, pedal input, &lt;a href=\"Exhaust%20system\"&gt;exhaust&lt;/a&gt; noise, and vehicle &lt;a href=\"vibration\"&gt;vibration&lt;/a&gt;s to change the interior and exterior noise of the vehicle. These input variables are &lt;a href=\"Filter%20%28signal%20processing%29\"&gt;filtered&lt;/a&gt; to produce desired &lt;a href=\"Input/output\"&gt;outputs&lt;/a&gt;. Variations of ASD select one or multiple of these variables to implement a new sound. These variations include:\nApplication and Theory.\nIn a typical combustion engine, &lt;a href=\"Cylinder%20%28engine%29\"&gt;cylinders&lt;/a&gt; are responsible for burning gasoline and producing &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; to power the vehicle. These cylinders fire &lt;a href=\"Periodic%20function\"&gt;periodically&lt;/a&gt; and can be reduced to a series of &lt;a href=\"Sine%20wave\"&gt;sinusoidal waves&lt;/a&gt; (by conventions of the &lt;a href=\"Fourier%20transform\"&gt;Fourier transform&lt;/a&gt;). These sine waves are dictated by the rotations per minute (RPM) of the engine &lt;a href=\"crankshaft\"&gt;crankshaft&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"firing%20order\"&gt;firing order&lt;/a&gt;, or arrangement, of the cylinders. To enrich engine sound in the passenger cabin, the &lt;a href=\"Harmonics%20%28electrical%20power%29\"&gt;harmonic orders&lt;/a&gt; of engine sound missing from the interior sound can be amplified through &lt;a href=\"Digital%20signal%20processing\"&gt;Digital Signal Processing&lt;/a&gt; (DSP) techniques.\nTo capture the missing orders, the &lt;a href=\"Mechanical%20load\"&gt;engine load&lt;/a&gt; condition is identified by &lt;a href=\"Accelerometer\"&gt;acceleration sensors&lt;/a&gt; on the engine of older vehicles, or by way of the &lt;a href=\"CAN%20bus\"&gt;Controller Area Network bus&lt;/a&gt; (CAN-bus) in modern cars. Using dynamic &lt;a href=\"band-pass%20filter\"&gt;band-pass filter&lt;/a&gt;s (a device that relays specified &lt;a href=\"Frequency\"&gt;frequencies&lt;/a&gt;), the missing orders are passed. To minimize &lt;a href=\"Noise\"&gt;artefacts&lt;/a&gt; (disruptive clicks) during the transfer, the signal is passed through cascading high- and low-pass filters. With an adaptation from the engine\u2019s RPM signal (captured by an &lt;a href=\"https%3A//ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8521570\"&gt;inductive voltage transformer&lt;/a&gt;), the orders are amplified through the vehicle &lt;a href=\"Firewall%20%28engine%29\"&gt;firewall&lt;/a&gt; (body separating the engine from the interior) and interior sound system.\nSubharmonics and Sound Signatures.\nIn electric and fuel cell vehicles, virtual (synthetic) sounds are often used to accommodate for the absence of a combustion engine sound. To create the optimal sound design in an electric vehicle (EV), manufacturers must acknowledge the &lt;a href=\"Psychoacoustics\"&gt;psychoacoustic&lt;/a&gt; theories behind sound preference. In a study of &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt; sound quality, experimental analysis compared a subjective rating of sound quality components with &lt;a href=\"J.D.%20Power\"&gt;J.D. Power&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s APEAL study.\nBased on studies of user preference in vehicle interiors, manufacturers aim to reduce &lt;a href=\"loudness\"&gt;loudness&lt;/a&gt; increment and high-frequency sound for a more pleasant driving experience. In modern EVs, the stock vehicle noise is masked with an RPM-dependent &lt;a href=\"Low-pass%20filter\"&gt;low-pass-filter&lt;/a&gt;ed sound. This low-pass-filtered sound is a lower-frequency synthetic sound that is based on the EV\u2019s actual engine parameters, like speed and load.\nAlt and Jochum\u2019s simple-&lt;a href=\"integer\"&gt;integer&lt;/a&gt; ratio technique of &lt;a href=\"harmonic\"&gt;harmonic&lt;/a&gt; order is applied to this virtual noise. Subharmonics (lower-frequency copies) are then isolated from the original &lt;a href=\"High%20frequency\"&gt;high-frequency&lt;/a&gt; components of the EV. In an evaluation of several generated sound stimuli, individuals subjectively identified that these subharmonics were preferable for the interior sound of an EV.\nCombustion engine vehicles respond dynamically to different driving conditions. For manufacturers to synthesize a brand sound in an EV, they must consider a sound signature that encompasses a dynamic driving sound. A base sound signature is defined by a schematic of sub-signatures and micro-signatures that can be expanded to increase the dynamic quality of the sound. These sub-signatures can be assigned to parameters (load, speed) or maneuvers that relay particular &lt;a href=\"Sampling%20%28music%29\"&gt;sound samples&lt;/a&gt;. By synthesizing micro-signatures in EV &lt;a href=\"drivetrain\"&gt;drivetrain&lt;/a&gt;s, the resulting sound is more vivid and emotional than the base frequencies of the EV.\nChallenges.\nConsumer Response.\nFor the average consumer, the advent of ASD goes largely unnoticed. With recent BMW models, however, consumers feel cheated by the synthetic engine sound. Numerous instructional videos featured online give a step-by-step on disabling the ASD within BMW\u2019s vehicles, as well as articles that addressed the false-sounding synthetic noise.\nBrand Identity for electric and fuel cell vehicles.\nTypical combustion engine vehicles provide sound feedback during operation that represents the brand identity of the car. Because of the nature of the &lt;a href=\"Electric%20motor\"&gt;single gear&lt;/a&gt; system and arrangement of &lt;a href=\"Electric%20power%20conversion\"&gt;power converters&lt;/a&gt; in electric and fuel cell vehicles, the frequency of sound changes minimally over a period of acceleration and is not well matched to the actual state of the vehicle speed and load. Additionally, the lack of engine noise leaves a spectral gap (empty space) between wind and road noise and amplifies individual vehicle components, reducing the sound quality inside the cabin.\nTo create a brand identity, manufacturers must choose between reproducing a typical combustion engine sound and creating an entirely new sound concept.\nReproduction of the combustion engine process.\nCurrent implementations of active sound design in combustion engine vehicles may not accurately reproduce the micro structure variations (variations between &lt;a href=\"Cylinder%20%28engine%29\"&gt;cylinder&lt;/a&gt; firings) of the combustion process. As the &lt;a href=\"Signal%20processing\"&gt;signal waves&lt;/a&gt; originate from multiple &lt;a href=\"Periodic%20function\"&gt;periodically&lt;/a&gt; firing cylinders, identifying and replicating the harmonic engine orders is an inefficient process. Additionally, this approach assumes uniformity in the combustion engine. The &lt;a href=\"force\"&gt;force&lt;/a&gt; provided from the cylinders is periodic and may vary from one cycle to another, making it impossible for the natural component of engine noise to be replicated.\nExample Applications.\nSeveral automotive companies implement their own branded versions of ASD technology."
