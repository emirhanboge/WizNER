    "text": "Don Muraco (born September 10, 1949) is an American retired &lt;a href=\"professional%20wrestling\"&gt;professional wrestler&lt;/a&gt; and podcaster. He is best known for his appearances with the &lt;a href=\"WWE\"&gt;World Wrestling Federation&lt;/a&gt; from 1981 to 1988, where he held the &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Intercontinental%20Championship\"&gt;WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20WWE%20Intercontinental%20Champions\"&gt;two occasions&lt;/a&gt; and was crowned the inaugural winner of the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20the%20Ring%20tournament\"&gt;King of the Ring tournament&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20the%20Ring%20%281985%29\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;. He was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;WWE Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20%282004%29\"&gt;class of 2004&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Professional%20Wrestling%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum\"&gt;Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.\nProfessional wrestling career.\nEarly career (1970\u20131981).\nMuraco was born at Sunset Beach, Oahu, Hawaii in 1949 and is of &lt;a href=\"Native%20Hawaiians\"&gt;Native Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt; heritage. A Hawaii state amateur wrestling champion for &lt;a href=\"Punahou%20School\"&gt;Punahou School&lt;/a&gt; in 1967, Muraco chose professional wrestling over &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;. He spent the first year of his career learning the ropes in &lt;a href=\"NWA%20All-Star%20Wrestling\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Northwest%20Wrestling\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Championship%20Wrestling%20from%20Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NWA%20Hollywood%20Wrestling\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; before getting his first big break, for &lt;a href=\"Verne%20Gagne\"&gt;Verne Gagne&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"American%20Wrestling%20Association\"&gt;American Wrestling Association&lt;/a&gt; (AWA). Wrestling as a &lt;a href=\"Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;face&lt;/a&gt;, he often &lt;a href=\"tag%20team\"&gt;tag team&lt;/a&gt;ed with &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Snuka\"&gt;Jimmy Snuka&lt;/a&gt;, against wrestlers such as &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Hennig\"&gt;Larry Hennig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Koloff\"&gt;Ivan Koloff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Rhodes%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Dusty Rhodes&lt;/a&gt;. In 1973, tired of life in &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis\"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;, he left the AWA for Roy Shire's &lt;a href=\"Big%20Time%20Wrestling%20%28San%20Francisco%29\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"National%20Wrestling%20Alliance\"&gt;NWA&lt;/a&gt; territory.\nIn 1974, Muraco moved to &lt;a href=\"Championship%20Wrestling%20from%20Florida\"&gt;Championship Wrestling from Florida&lt;/a&gt; (CWF). He was frequently compared to the &lt;a href=\"NWA%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;NWA World Champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Brisco\"&gt;Jack Brisco&lt;/a&gt;, whom he physically resembled. In a match between the two on May 28, 1974, Muraco reversed Brisco's finishing move, the &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20holds%23Figure%20four%20leglock\"&gt;figure four leglock&lt;/a&gt;. Though Muraco lost the match by disqualification, this feat made him a star.\nAfter brief stints in &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, Muraco returned to California in 1975 and won his first singles title, the &lt;a href=\"NWA%20Americas%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He then won the San Francisco version of the &lt;a href=\"NWA%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship%20%28San%20Francisco%20version%29\"&gt;NWA World Tag Team Championship&lt;/a&gt; with Masked Invader #1. In San Francisco, Muraco learned to work as a &lt;a href=\"Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;heel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1977 through 1981, Muraco shuttled several more times between Florida, San Francisco and his native Hawaii. In Florida, he was involved in two high-profile &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Angle\"&gt;angles&lt;/a&gt;. In 1979, a masked villain called \"The Magnificent M\" appeared in the territory. Though it came as little surprise when he was eventually unmasked as Muraco, his bald head shocked the audience. Then, in 1980, he &lt;a href=\"feud%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;feuded&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Windham\"&gt;Barry Windham&lt;/a&gt;, in which the bigger and more experienced Muraco &lt;a href=\"piledriver%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;piledrove&lt;/a&gt; the rookie on the concrete floor. Windham eventually got his revenge, in the process becoming a credible wrestler in the eyes of the fans.\nWorld Wrestling Federation (1981\u20131984, 1985\u20131988).\nIntercontinental Heavyweight Champion (1981\u20131984).\nMuraco debuted in the &lt;a href=\"WWE\"&gt;World Wrestling Federation&lt;/a&gt; (WWF) in Allentown, Pennsylvania defeating Steve King on February 24, 1981. Managed by &lt;a href=\"Ernie%20Roth\"&gt;The Grand Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, he captured the &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Intercontinental%20Championship\"&gt;WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt; on June 20, 1981, from &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Morales\"&gt;Pedro Morales&lt;/a&gt;; he lost it to Morales on November 23 in a Texas Death match, capping a bloody feud. That year, Muraco wrestled then &lt;a href=\"WWE%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;WWF Heavyweight Champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Backlund\"&gt;Bob Backlund&lt;/a&gt; several times, including a 60-minute draw on October 24. He split 1982 between &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Crockett%20Promotions\"&gt;Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (where he partnered with &lt;a href=\"Roddy%20Piper\"&gt;Roddy Piper&lt;/a&gt; for a time), &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;Georgia Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (where he also wrestled under a mask as Dr. X) and &lt;a href=\"New%20Japan%20Pro-Wrestling\"&gt;New Japan Pro-Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (where he wrestled in the annual &lt;a href=\"Madison%20Square%20Garden\"&gt;MSG&lt;/a&gt; League tournament), before returning to the WWF that fall.\nNow managed by &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Albano\"&gt;Captain Lou Albano&lt;/a&gt;, Muraco regained the Intercontinental title from Morales on January 22, 1983. That year, Muraco feuded with Albano's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Snuka\"&gt;Jimmy Snuka&lt;/a&gt;. The feud culminated on October 17, in a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Cages\"&gt;steel cage match&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Madison%20Square%20Garden\"&gt;Madison Square Garden&lt;/a&gt;. Snuka lost the match, but afterward dragged Muraco back into the ring and hit his finisher, the &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20aerial%20techniques%23Splash\"&gt;Superfly Splash&lt;/a&gt;, from the top of the 15-foot cage. In the crowd at the Garden for this match was future WWE Hall of Famer &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Foley\"&gt;Mick Foley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Sandman%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;the Sandman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Dreamer\"&gt;Tommy Dreamer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mark%20LoMonaco\"&gt;Bubba Ray Dudley&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his two Intercontinental title reigns, Muraco had bloody feuds with &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Backlund\"&gt;Bob Backlund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Atlas\"&gt;Tony Atlas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Johnson\"&gt;Rocky Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. He portrayed an arrogant villain who angrily demanded respect, while engaging in disrespectful behavior himself; in one match, he brought a &lt;a href=\"submarine%20sandwich\"&gt;submarine sandwich&lt;/a&gt; to the ring and ate it while dominating his outmatched opponent. Later, he would preface his matches by dedicating his impending finishing move, the piledriver, to either the heel commentator or whomever he was feuding with at the time. Audiences regularly mocked Muraco and his Hawaiian origins with derisive chants of \"beach bum\". On February 11, 1984, Muraco lost the Intercontinental title to &lt;a href=\"Tito%20Santana\"&gt;Tito Santana&lt;/a&gt;. After a series of unsuccessful rematches, Muraco took a hiatus from WWF in August 1984. He went to NWA Polynesian for a short stint, and also wrestled in Japan.\nAlliance with Mr. Fuji (1985\u20131987).\nMuraco returned to the WWF in 1985, managed by &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Fuji\"&gt;Mr. Fuji&lt;/a&gt;. After not wrestling on the card of the first &lt;a href=\"WrestleMania%20%281985%29\"&gt;WrestleMania&lt;/a&gt;, Muraco headlined three consecutive &lt;a href=\"Madison%20Square%20Garden\"&gt;Madison Square Garden&lt;/a&gt; cards against WWF World Heavyweight Champion &lt;a href=\"Hulk%20Hogan\"&gt;Hulk Hogan&lt;/a&gt;, climaxing in a bloody steel cage match on June 21, which Hogan won. On July 8, Muraco won the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20the%20Ring%20%281985%29\"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20the%20Ring%20tournament\"&gt;King of the Ring tournament&lt;/a&gt; when he pinned &lt;a href=\"The%20Iron%20Sheik\"&gt;The Iron Sheik&lt;/a&gt; in the Final. Before defeating the Sheik, Muraco had defeated the &lt;a href=\"Junkyard%20Dog\"&gt;Junkyard Dog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Les%20Thornton\"&gt;Les Thornton&lt;/a&gt; and Pedro Morales to reach the Final.\nIn addition to feuding with &lt;a href=\"Ricky%20Steamboat\"&gt;Ricky Steamboat&lt;/a&gt; for much of the remainder of the year which included hanging Steamboat from the top rope with Steamboat's own karate belt on an episode of \"&lt;a href=\"WWF%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;WWF Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;\", Fuji and Muraco debuted \"Fuji Vice\", a series of skits parodying &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Vice\"&gt;Miami Vice&lt;/a&gt;, on \"&lt;a href=\"Tuesday%20Night%20Titans\"&gt;Tuesday Night Titans&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Fuji General\", a parody of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; soap \"&lt;a href=\"General%20Hospital\"&gt;General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;\", followed soon after). In 1986, Muraco allied with &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Adonis\"&gt;Adrian Adonis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Orton%20Jr.\"&gt;Bob Orton Jr.&lt;/a&gt; in their feud with Roddy Piper. This led to Orton and Muraco becoming a regular tag team. In March 1987 they lost to the &lt;a href=\"Can-Am%20Connection\"&gt;Can-Am Connection&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tom%20Zenk\"&gt;Tom Zenk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Martel\"&gt;Rick Martel&lt;/a&gt;) in the opening match of &lt;a href=\"Wrestlemania%20III\"&gt;Wrestlemania III&lt;/a&gt; in front of a reported 93,173 fans at the &lt;a href=\"Pontiac%20Silverdome\"&gt;Pontiac Silverdome&lt;/a&gt;. In July 1987, a falling out between Muraco and Orton led to a feud between them and a face turn for Muraco. Muraco won almost every match in the feud, on TV and at house shows, until Orton left the WWF that year.\n\"The Rock\" (1987\u20131988).\nIn a TV taping aired in November 1987, Muraco solidified his face status by saving &lt;a href=\"Superstar%20Billy%20Graham\"&gt;Superstar Billy Graham&lt;/a&gt; from a three-on-one beating by &lt;a href=\"Butch%20Reed\"&gt;Butch Reed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"One%20Man%20Gang\"&gt;One Man Gang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slick%20%28wrestling%29\"&gt;Slick&lt;/a&gt;, and taking Graham as his new manager. Muraco adopted Graham's &lt;a href=\"tie-dye\"&gt;tie-dye&lt;/a&gt; attire and changed his nickname from \"Magnificent Muraco\" to \"The Rock\" (although announcer Gorilla Monsoon continued to refer to Muraco by his previous nickname). Muraco replaced Graham on the team led by his former rival &lt;a href=\"Hulk%20Hogan\"&gt;Hulk Hogan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Survivor%20Series%20%281987%29\"&gt;first Survivor Series&lt;/a&gt;, and had a good showing at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Rumble%20%281988%29\"&gt;first Royal Rumble&lt;/a&gt;, where he eliminated three wrestlers (tied for second most with &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Duggan\"&gt;\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan&lt;/a&gt;) and was one of the final four competitors. He later reached the quarterfinals of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament at &lt;a href=\"WrestleMania%20IV\"&gt;WrestleMania IV&lt;/a&gt;. In his final months with the WWF, he feuded with &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Valentine\"&gt;Greg Valentine&lt;/a&gt; and lost to &lt;a href=\"Dino%20Bravo\"&gt;Dino Bravo&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"SummerSlam%20%281988%29\"&gt;inaugural SummerSlam&lt;/a&gt;. Muraco had his last match in the WWF against Barry Horowitz in October 1988 on a tour of Italy, but was then fired.\nVarious promotions (1988\u20131995).\nAfter leaving the WWF, Muraco split his time between &lt;a href=\"Stampede%20Wrestling\"&gt;Stampede Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (where he defeated &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Shaw\"&gt;Makhan Singh&lt;/a&gt; to win the North American Heavyweight title), the AWA (where he wrestled &lt;a href=\"AWA%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;AWA World Heavyweight Champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Zbyszko\"&gt;Larry Zbyszko&lt;/a&gt; to a double disqualification), &lt;a href=\"All%20Japan%20Pro%20Wrestling\"&gt;All Japan Pro Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, and Herb Abrams' &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Wrestling%20Federation%20%28Herb%20Abrams%29\"&gt;UWF&lt;/a&gt; (where he feuded with &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Foley\"&gt;Cactus Jack&lt;/a&gt;). On May 23, 1993 he made an appearance at &lt;a href=\"World%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;World Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; where he teamed with &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Murdoch\"&gt;Dick Murdoch&lt;/a&gt; and Jimmy Snuka against &lt;a href=\"Wahoo%20McDaniel\"&gt;Wahoo McDaniel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Brunzell\"&gt;Jim Brunzell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackjack%20Mulligan\"&gt;Blackjack Mulligan&lt;/a&gt; at .\nEastern Championship Wrestling (1992\u20131993).\nBefore the promotion was renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling, Muraco rekindled old feuds there with &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Snuka\"&gt;Jimmy Snuka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tito%20Santana\"&gt;Tito Santana&lt;/a&gt;. He defeated Snuka on September 30, 1992, for the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20Championship\"&gt;ECW Championship&lt;/a&gt;, dropping it to &lt;a href=\"The%20Sandman%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;The Sandman&lt;/a&gt; on November 16. On April 3, 1993, he regained it in a rematch, finally losing it to Santana on August 8.\nWrestle Association R (1994).\nMuraco, as Aka Oni, debuted for &lt;a href=\"Wrestle%20Association%20R\"&gt;Wrestle Association R&lt;/a&gt; (WAR) on August 25, 1994, defeating &lt;a href=\"Takashi%20Ishikawa\"&gt;Takashi Ishikawa&lt;/a&gt;. He had twelve more matches with the promotion, culminating in a tag loss (with Ai Oni) to &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Hamaguchi\"&gt;Animal Hamaguchi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryuma%20Go\"&gt;Ryuma Go&lt;/a&gt; on December 4, at WAR Mega Power in &lt;a href=\"Sumo%20Hall\"&gt;Sumo Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetirement (1995\u2013present).\nAfter retiring from the ring in 1995, Muraco returned to Hawaii. In 2003, he co-founded Hawai'i Championship Wrestling with local TV producer Linda Bade, which ran from 2003 to 2008. He was the storyline commissioner of Hawai'i Championship Wrestling until 2006. He also worked as a &lt;a href=\"Stevedore\"&gt;longshoreman&lt;/a&gt;. On May 22, 1998, he returned to wrestling for one night where he lost to &lt;a href=\"The%20Honky%20Tonk%20Man\"&gt;The Honky Tonk Man&lt;/a&gt; at Northern Wrestling States Wrestler Alliance. He also returned to wrestling in Hawaii where he defeated the Kodiak Bear at Hawaiian Islands Wrestling Federation on January 9, 1999.\nIn 2004, Muraco was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;WWE Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20%282004%29\"&gt;class of 2004&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Foley\"&gt;Mick Foley&lt;/a&gt;, who, like &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Dreamer\"&gt;Tommy Dreamer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20LoMonaco\"&gt;Bubba Ray Dudley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Devon%20Hughes\"&gt;D-Von Dudley&lt;/a&gt;, credits the 1983 steel cage match between Muraco and Snuka at &lt;a href=\"Madison%20Square%20Garden\"&gt;Madison Square Garden&lt;/a&gt; (which he attended) as his inspiration for becoming a wrestler. He managed his son, Joe, in &lt;a href=\"World%20Xtreme%20Wrestling\"&gt;WXW&lt;/a&gt;.
