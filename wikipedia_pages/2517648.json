The Hurricanes compete in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (NCAA)'s &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;Division I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20Football%20Bowl%20Subdivision\"&gt;Football Bowl Subdivision&lt;/a&gt; (FBS) and the &lt;a href=\"Coastal%20Division\"&gt;Coastal Division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; (ACC). The program began in 1926 and has won five &lt;a href=\"AP%20Poll\"&gt;AP national championships&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"1983%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1987%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1989%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1991%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2001%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Miami Hurricanes are among the most storied and decorated football programs in NCAA history. Miami is ranked fourth on the list of All-time Associated Press National Poll Championships, tied with &lt;a href=\"USC%20Trojans%20football\"&gt;Southern California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State\"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt; and behind &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20Football\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiami also holds a number of &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Draft\"&gt;NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; records, including most first-round selections in a single draft and most consecutive drafts with at least one first-round selection. Two Hurricanes have won the &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt; and nine have been inducted to the &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;College Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. The team plays its home games at &lt;a href=\"Hard%20Rock%20Stadium\"&gt;Hard Rock Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Gardens%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Miami Gardens, Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1926\u20131978).\nThe University of Miami football program began with just a freshman team in 1926. Its first game was played on October 23, &lt;a href=\"1926%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;1926&lt;/a&gt;, a 7\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Rollins%20College\"&gt;Rollins College&lt;/a&gt; before 304 fans. Under the guidance of head coach &lt;a href=\"Cub%20Buck\"&gt;Howard \"Cub\" Buck&lt;/a&gt;, the freshman team posted a perfect 8\u20130 record in its inaugural season. Two of the wins were against the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Havana\"&gt;University of Havana&lt;/a&gt;, one on &lt;a href=\"Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Thanksgiving Day&lt;/a&gt; in Miami and one at Havana on &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas Day&lt;/a&gt;. Miami's last home game of the season featured a first: the first Hurricane football game played on New Year's Day against &lt;a href=\"Samford%20University\"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; at Miami's University Stadium. Around this time, the team adopted the official nickname \"Hurricanes\", though the exact timing and origin of the name is unclear; some reports suggest it was in reference to the devastating power of the &lt;a href=\"1926%20Miami%20hurricane\"&gt;1926 hurricane&lt;/a&gt; that postponed the program's first game by a month, and others that it was suggested by a player in response to rumors that university officials wanted to name the team after local &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;. Varsity competition began in 1927, with Miami beating Rollins, 39\u20133, in its first game and going on to a 3\u20136\u20131 record. The team improved to 4\u20134\u20131 in &lt;a href=\"1928%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;1928&lt;/a&gt;, but it was not enough for Buck to keep his job, and he was replaced prior to the &lt;a href=\"1929%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;1929 season&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"J.%20Burton%20Rix\"&gt;J. Burton Rix&lt;/a&gt;, previously head coach at &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Methodist%20Mustangs%20football\"&gt;Southern Methodist&lt;/a&gt;. Rix's arrival was funded by a group of local businessmen. That off-season, the program, which competed as an &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20independent%20schools\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; during its first two years of existence, joined the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Intercollegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (SIAA). 1929 saw Miami play its first varsity road game (a 14\u20130 loss at &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%E2%80%93Lafayette%20Ragin%27%20Cajuns%20football\"&gt;Southwest Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;), and Rix led the team to its first winning season, going 3\u20132. His tenure, however, was short-lived; off-campus financing for the program dried up in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929\"&gt;1929 stock market crash&lt;/a&gt;, and he resigned after one season. &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20E.%20Brett\"&gt;Ernest Brett&lt;/a&gt; replaced Rix, and in &lt;a href=\"1930%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;1930&lt;/a&gt;, Miami played &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Owls%20football\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; in its first game outside &lt;a href=\"Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;the South&lt;/a&gt;, losing 34\u20130 to the Owls in &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Atlantic City, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. On October 31, 1930, the Hurricanes played in one of the nation's first night games vs. &lt;a href=\"Bowden%20College\"&gt;Bowden College&lt;/a&gt; in Miami. Brett only lasted one year, and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20McCann\"&gt;Tom McCann&lt;/a&gt; became the program's fourth head coach in 1931. Under McCann, the football program experienced its most successful seasons to that point. After a difficult first year, Miami put together a winning &lt;a href=\"1932%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;record in 1932&lt;/a&gt; and served as host to the inaugural &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Bowl%23Palm%20Festival\"&gt;Palm Festival&lt;/a&gt; (later to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;), defeating &lt;a href=\"Manhattan%20College\"&gt;Manhattan College&lt;/a&gt; 7\u20130 at Moore Park in Miami. A 5\u20131\u20132 campaign and another Palm Festival berth followed in &lt;a href=\"1933%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;1933&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"1934%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;1934&lt;/a&gt;, the program played in its first official &lt;a href=\"bowl%20game\"&gt;bowl game&lt;/a&gt;, losing to &lt;a href=\"Bucknell%20Bison%20football\"&gt;Bucknell&lt;/a&gt; in the first Orange Bowl, 26\u20130. In 1935, a group of Miami football supporters sought to hire &lt;a href=\"Red%20Grange\"&gt;Red Grange&lt;/a&gt; as coach. However, the move was vetoed by President &lt;a href=\"Bowman%20Foster%20Ashe\"&gt;Bowman Foster Ashe&lt;/a&gt;, in part because of the $7,500 salary that Grange had requested. Instead &lt;a href=\"Irl%20Tubbs\"&gt;Irl Tubbs&lt;/a&gt; took over as head coach in 1935, and though Miami compiled an 11\u20135\u20132 record in his two seasons, it did not play in a bowl in either year.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Irl%20Tubbs\"&gt;Irl Tubbs&lt;/a&gt; resigned following the &lt;a href=\"1936%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;1936 season&lt;/a&gt; to become head coach at &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20Hawkeyes%20football\"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Harding\"&gt;Jack Harding&lt;/a&gt; was hired to serve as both head football coach and &lt;a href=\"athletic%20director\"&gt;athletic director&lt;/a&gt; at Miami. In 1937, the Hurricanes moved into the brand new &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Burdine Municipal Stadium&lt;/a&gt; (renamed the Orange Bowl in 1959), located west of downtown &lt;a href=\"Miami\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, Miami played archrival &lt;a href=\"1938%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, defeating the Gators 19\u20137 at &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Field\"&gt;Florida Field&lt;/a&gt;, and won the program's first &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Intercollegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; title with an 8\u20132 record. The Hurricanes, though, left the SIAA just three years later, becoming an &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20independent%20schools\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; once again. Harding led the Hurricanes to eight- and seven- win campaigns in 1941 and 1942, respectively, before he was called away by &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; service. &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Dunn%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Eddie Dunn&lt;/a&gt;, a former star running back at Miami under Harding, stepped into the void and served as head coach during Harding's two-year war service. Though the Hurricanes won five games in 1943, they faltered in 1944, winning just one game against seven losses and a tie. Fortunes changed with Harding's return in 1945, as the Hurricanes went 9\u20131\u20131 and returned to the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Bowl%20%28game%29\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 1934, defeating &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Cross%20Crusaders%20football\"&gt;Holy Cross&lt;/a&gt; 13\u20136 in a memorable game. With the score tied 6\u20136 and only seconds remaining, Holy Cross quarterback &lt;a href=\"Gene%20DeFilippo\"&gt;Gene DeFilippo&lt;/a&gt; was intercepted by Miami's &lt;a href=\"Al%20Hudson\"&gt;Al Hudson&lt;/a&gt; at the 11-yard line. Hudson dashed 89 yards the other way for the game-winning touchdown as time expired. Harding's Hurricanes won eight games in 1946, but after the team slipped to 2\u20137\u20131 in 1947, he resigned as head coach, but continued as athletic director. He hired &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Gustafson\"&gt;Andy Gustafson&lt;/a&gt; as the new head coach, closing out a nine-year tenure in which Miami went 54\u201329\u20133 and won at least 8 games in four different seasons.\nOne of &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Gustafson\"&gt;Andy Gustafson&lt;/a&gt;'s major innovations at Miami was the \"drive series\" offense, an &lt;a href=\"option%20offense\"&gt;option-oriented attack&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Split-T\"&gt;Split-T&lt;/a&gt; formation that relied on &lt;a href=\"zone%20blocking\"&gt;zone blocking&lt;/a&gt; and featured either a &lt;a href=\"fullback%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;fullback&lt;/a&gt; fake or carry on every play. Under Gustafson's tutelage, Miami produced its first &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20All-America%20Team\"&gt;All-American&lt;/a&gt;, Al Carapella, in 1950 and went 9\u20131\u20131 in &lt;a href=\"1951%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;1951&lt;/a&gt;, including a 35\u201313 win in its first-ever game against rival &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; and a 15\u201314 loss to &lt;a href=\"Clemson%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Clemson&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Bowl%20%28game%29\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"1952%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt;, Miami won eight games and went to a bowl game in consecutive years for the first time in school history, shutting out Clemson 14\u20130 in a rematch at the &lt;a href=\"Gator%20Bowl\"&gt;Gator Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. In the middle of the &lt;a href=\"1954%20college%20football%20season\"&gt;1954 season&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; imposed two one-year &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20probation\"&gt;penalties&lt;/a&gt; against Miami for providing transportation and tryouts to prospective players. As a result, Gustafson's 1954 squad was ineligible to play in a &lt;a href=\"bowl%20game\"&gt;bowl game&lt;/a&gt;, and the 8\u20131 Hurricanes, whose lone loss came 14\u201313 at No. 14 &lt;a href=\"Auburn%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Auburn&lt;/a&gt;, finished the season ranked ninth in the &lt;a href=\"Coaches%27%20Poll%23College%20football\"&gt;Coaches' Poll&lt;/a&gt;, the first top ten poll finish in school history. Two years later in 1956, an 8\u20131\u20131 Miami team, led by team captain and All-American &lt;a href=\"Don%20Bosseler\"&gt;Don Bosseler&lt;/a&gt;, was under consideration to play in the &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, but the program's bowl-ban was not due to expire until ten days after the game, rendering it ineligible to participate. The team finished the season ranked sixth in both the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Poll\"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; and Coaches' Polls. In the later years of Gustafson's tenure, two-time All-America quarterback &lt;a href=\"George%20Mira\"&gt;George Mira&lt;/a&gt; guided the Hurricanes to berths in the &lt;a href=\"1961%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Bowl\"&gt;Liberty Bowl&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"1962%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gotham%20Bowl\"&gt;Gotham Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, where they lost both games. In &lt;a href=\"1963%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt;, the team struggled to a 3\u20137 record. Nevertheless, Mira, who set many of the school's passing records during his four years at Miami, appeared on the cover of \"&lt;a href=\"Sports%20Illustrated\"&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/a&gt;\" and finished fifth in the &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt; voting as a senior. Following the season, Gustafson decided to step down as head coach and &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Tate\"&gt;Charlie Tate&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant at &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt;, was hired to replace him. Gustafson has the Hurricane record for most years as head coach (16) and most wins (93). &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Tate\"&gt;Charlie Tate&lt;/a&gt;'s first seasons at Miami were uneventful, with the team posting a 4\u20135\u20131 record in &lt;a href=\"1964%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; and a reverse 5\u20134\u20131 record in &lt;a href=\"1965%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1965&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"1966%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1966&lt;/a&gt; brought the arrival of &lt;a href=\"defensive%20end\"&gt;defensive end&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Hendricks\"&gt;Ted Hendricks&lt;/a&gt;, the only three-time &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20All-America%20Team\"&gt;All-American&lt;/a&gt; in school history, and &lt;a href=\"1966%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;the Hurricanes won eight games&lt;/a&gt;, earning a trip to the &lt;a href=\"1966%20Liberty%20Bowl\"&gt;Liberty Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, where they defeated No. 9 &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;, 14\u20137. In December 1966, the program was &lt;a href=\"Racial%20integration\"&gt;integrated&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"African-American\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wide%20receiver\"&gt;wide receiver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bellamy\"&gt;Ray Bellamy&lt;/a&gt; signed a letter of intent to play football at the university. Miami returned to bowl play in &lt;a href=\"1967%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1967&lt;/a&gt;, dropping the &lt;a href=\"Bluebonnet%20Bowl\"&gt;Bluebonnet Bowl&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Buffaloes%20football\"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, 31\u201321. The Hurricanes had a 5\u20135\u20130 season in 1968 and 4\u20136\u20130 in 1969, and Tate resigned as head coach two games into the &lt;a href=\"1970%20NCAA%20University%20Division%20football%20season\"&gt;1970 season&lt;/a&gt;, later citing burn out and fatigue from \"fighting the money battle and other battles\" as the basis for his decision. &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Kichefski\"&gt;Walt Kichefski&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant on Tate's staff, was elevated to head coach in the wake of Tate's resignation and coached the team to a 3\u20138 record in 1970. He was not retained the following season.\nOn December 20, 1970, &lt;a href=\"Fran%20Curci\"&gt;Fran Curci&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20All-America%20Team\"&gt;All-American&lt;/a&gt; quarterback for the Hurricanes under &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Gustafson\"&gt;Andy Gustafson&lt;/a&gt;, was named as the program's new head coach. Curci's &lt;a href=\"1971%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1971 team&lt;/a&gt; improved by a game, but rival &lt;a href=\"1971%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida Gators&lt;/a&gt; defeated Miami in a game that came to be known as \"the Gator Flop.\" The Gators led throughout the game and were up 45\u20138 when &lt;a href=\"John%20Reaves\"&gt;John Reaves&lt;/a&gt; threw an interception to Miami's defense with little time left in the fourth quarter. Reaves needed just 15 more passing yards to break the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; record for career passing yards. But with time winding down and Miami driving in Florida territory, there was a good chance the Gators offense would not get the ball back. After the Miami snap at the Florida 8 yard line, nearly all the Gators defensive players \"flopped\" down on the field. Miami quarterback John Hornibrook walked in untouched for a touchdown. A few minutes later, Reaves got his record as time expired. Curci called the incident \"the worst thing I have ever seen in football.\"\n&lt;a href=\"1972%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt; brought another memorable finish for Miami, when the inadvertent gift of a \"fifth down\" by officials enabled the Hurricanes to edge &lt;a href=\"Tulane%20Green%20Wave%20football\"&gt;Tulane&lt;/a&gt; in the waning moments of the game for a 24\u201321 win. Curci left the program at the conclusion of the season and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Elliot\"&gt;Pete Elliot&lt;/a&gt;. Elliot, in turn, lasted two seasons and stepped down in 1975 to become Miami's &lt;a href=\"athletic%20director\"&gt;athletic director&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Offensive%20coordinator\"&gt;Offensive coordinator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Selmer\"&gt;Carl Selmer&lt;/a&gt; was named the program's fifth head coach in six years. Under Selmer, a trend that started earlier in the decade continued, with home attendance declining every year. After finishing 2\u20138 in 1975 and 3\u20138 in 1976, the university fired Selmer, citing concerns about dwindling attendance and the loss of local &lt;a href=\"blue%20chip%20%28sports%29\"&gt;blue-chip recruits&lt;/a&gt; to other schools. After a national search, &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Saban\"&gt;Lou Saban&lt;/a&gt;, formerly head coach of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Bills\"&gt;Buffalo Bills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denver%20Broncos\"&gt;Denver Broncos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Patriots\"&gt;Boston Patriots&lt;/a&gt;, was hired on December 27, 1976, as head coach. Miami only won three games in &lt;a href=\"1977%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20football%20season\"&gt;1977&lt;/a&gt;, but Saban was able to put together a well-regarded recruiting class that included future &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Pro Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; quarterback &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Kelly\"&gt;Jim Kelly&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"East%20Brady%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;East Brady, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. Kelly had been recruited by &lt;a href=\"Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football\"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"linebacker\"&gt;linebacker&lt;/a&gt; and agreed to come to Miami after Saban promised him he would play quarterback. Among the other 30 signees in Saban's first recruiting class were 11 future NFL players. The Hurricanes improved by three games in Saban's second season and &lt;a href=\"Ottis%20Anderson\"&gt;Ottis Anderson&lt;/a&gt; emerged as an NFL talent. Anderson became the first Miami running back to rush for 1,000 yards in a season and led the team in rushing for three straight seasons from 1977 through 1979. Anderson set numerous school rushing records and was Miami's career rushing leader until 2014, when he was overtaken by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Johnson\"&gt;Duke Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. After just two seasons as head coach, Saban resigned in the wake of a controversy concerning football players throwing a Jewish man into &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Osceola\"&gt;Lake Osceola&lt;/a&gt;, an on campus lake. He left after the 1978 season to take the head coaching position at &lt;a href=\"Army%20Black%20Knights%20football\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoward Schnellenberger era (1979\u20131983).\nSaban's departure, the constant coaching upheaval Miami experienced during the decade, and assorted fiscal problems sparked the university's board of trustees to hold a vote on whether to drop the football program down to the &lt;a href=\"Division%20I-AA\"&gt;Division I-AA&lt;/a&gt; level or eliminate it altogether. University executive vice president Dr. John Green was able to convince the board to give &lt;a href=\"Division%20I-A\"&gt;Division I-A&lt;/a&gt; football another shot and hired &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Schnellenberger\"&gt;Howard Schnellenberger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"offensive%20coordinator\"&gt;offensive coordinator&lt;/a&gt; for the NFL's &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Dolphins\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, to succeed Saban. Despite not having any college head coaching experience, Schnellenberger had impressive credentials, playing &lt;a href=\"end%20%28gridiron%20football%29\"&gt;end&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Wildcats%20football\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; from 1952 to 1956 under head coach &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Bryant\"&gt;Bear Bryant&lt;/a&gt; and serving as Bryant's offensive coordinator at &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; from 1961 to 1965, helping the Crimson Tide win three national championships in 1961, 1964 and 1965. Schnellenberger also served as offensive coordinator for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Dolphins\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Don%20Shula\"&gt;Don Shula&lt;/a&gt;, helping the team achieve an undefeated, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;-winning season in 1972. Schnellenberger served as head coach of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Colts\"&gt;Baltimore Colts&lt;/a&gt; from 1973 to 1974.\nAt the outset of his tenure, &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Schnellenberger\"&gt;Howard Schnellenberger&lt;/a&gt; announced to his staff and players his intention to win a &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20National%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;national championship&lt;/a&gt; within five years, a bold claim for a program that was seemingly on its last legs. His five-year plan had two main priorities: installing a &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Style\"&gt;pro-style&lt;/a&gt; passing offense and upgrading the talent level on the roster through a new recruiting strategy aimed at heavily targeting the best local talent from the city of Miami and the region of &lt;a href=\"South%20Florida\"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt;, a strategy that would drastically change national recruiting in the state of &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; in the coming years. On the recruiting front, Schnellenberger spoke of mining the \"State of Miami\", which entailed fencing off the fertile &lt;a href=\"South%20Florida\"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt; recruiting base from other programs and cherry-picking the rest of the nation for a few choice recruits. To help with the new pro-style offense, Schnellenberger hired former &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Colts\"&gt;Baltimore Colts&lt;/a&gt; quarterback &lt;a href=\"Earl%20Morrall\"&gt;Earl Morrall&lt;/a&gt; as a volunteer quarterbacks coach. Schnellenberger also sought to exploit the freedom provided by Miami's &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20independent%20schools\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; schedule to gain \"intersectional exposure\" and make the program \"national.\"\nOn the field, Miami went 5\u20136 in &lt;a href=\"1979%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;Schnellenberger's debut season&lt;/a&gt;, which was highlighted by a 26\u201310 upset win at No. 16 &lt;a href=\"Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions\"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href=\"Redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29\"&gt;redshirt&lt;/a&gt; freshman &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Kelly\"&gt;Jim Kelly&lt;/a&gt; threw for 280 yards and three touchdowns in his first career start as Miami's quarterback. Schnellenberger set a bowl berth as the goal of the &lt;a href=\"1980%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1980 campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the team made good on its head coach's expectations, winning nine games and earning a trip to the &lt;a href=\"1981%20Peach%20Bowl%20%28January%29\"&gt;1981 Peach Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, where the Hurricanes defeated &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt; 20\u201310. The bowl berth was Miami's first since 1967 and the team finished the season ranked 18th in both the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Poll\"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coaches%27%20Poll\"&gt;Coaches'&lt;/a&gt; Polls. Miami continued to improve in &lt;a href=\"1981%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt;, going 9\u20132 and defeating No. 1 &lt;a href=\"Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football\"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; 17\u201314 in a late-October game at the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. In the season's final game, the Hurricanes topped rival &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 1960, 37\u201315, finishing the season eighth in the AP Poll. The &lt;a href=\"1982%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt;, the team finished with four losses following Kelly's shoulder injury. Entering the &lt;a href=\"1983%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1983 season&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the fifth of Schnellenberger's tenure\u2014the program had to find a replacement for the recently graduated Kelly. Ultimately, Schnellenberger chose &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Kosar\"&gt;Bernie Kosar&lt;/a&gt; as the team's starting quarterback over fellow redshirt freshman &lt;a href=\"Vinny%20Testaverde\"&gt;Vinny Testaverde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1983%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1983 Miami Hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; started the season unranked and lost 28\u20133 at &lt;a href=\"1983%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; in their first game, though Kosar tied &lt;a href=\"George%20Mira\"&gt;George Mira&lt;/a&gt;'s single-game school record of 25 pass completions. The Hurricanes rallied by winning their next 10 games, including a 20\u20130 early-season shutout of &lt;a href=\"1983%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football%20team\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;, and earned a berth to the &lt;a href=\"1984%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;1984 Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt; to play the undefeated, top-ranked &lt;a href=\"1983%20Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football%20team\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; team that had both &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Rozier\"&gt;Mike Rozier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turner%20Gill\"&gt;Turner Gill&lt;/a&gt;. The Orange Bowl-berth was Miami's first since 1951, but the program's first national championship remained a long shot, as the Hurricanes entered the game ranked fifth. Miami got much needed help early on New Year's Day when second-ranked &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Longhorns%20football\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, the nation's other undefeated team, lost in the &lt;a href=\"1984%20Cotton%20Bowl%20Classic\"&gt;Cotton Bowl Classic&lt;/a&gt; and fourth-ranked &lt;a href=\"Illinois%20Fighting%20Illini%20football\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; lost in the &lt;a href=\"1984%20Rose%20Bowl\"&gt;Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Behind Kosar's passing, Miami jumped out to a 17\u20130 lead, but Nebraska battled back and cut Miami's lead to 31\u201324 in the fourth quarter. With 48 seconds remaining, Nebraska scored a touchdown to make it 31\u201330 and, being the number one-ranked team in the nation, needed only to kick the extra point to tie the game and put itself in position to win the national championship. Nebraska head coach &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Osborne\"&gt;Tom Osborne&lt;/a&gt; elected to go for the win and attempt a two-point conversion instead. On the ensuing play, Miami &lt;a href=\"Safety%20%28American%20football%20position%29\"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; Kenny Calhoun tipped away Gill's pass to receiver Jeff Smith in the end zone, saving the game and winning Miami the national championship when it leap-frogged No. 3 &lt;a href=\"1983%20Auburn%20Tigers%20football%20team\"&gt;Auburn&lt;/a&gt; to finish first in the final polls. Although Schnellenberger had made good on his five-year plan to win a national championship, he left after the season to accept a head coaching position in the &lt;a href=\"USFL\"&gt;USFL&lt;/a&gt;.\nJimmy Johnson era (1984\u20131988).\nTwo weeks later, athletic director &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Jankovich\"&gt;Sam Jankovich&lt;/a&gt; hired &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20State%20Cowboys%20football\"&gt;Oklahoma State&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Johnson%20%28American%20football%20coach%29\"&gt;Jimmy Johnson&lt;/a&gt; to fill the vacancy. One of Jimmy Johnson's immediate priorities upon taking over as Miami head coach was to switch to a 4\u20133 defense. Johnson wanted to implement the change for his first season, but lacking the time, personnel, and staff, he decided to postpone the switch and kept Schnellenberger's 5\u20132 defensive package for the 1984 season.\nThe team struggled to an 8\u20135 record in Johnson's first season, losing a number of noteworthy games. In the next-to-last game of the regular season, the No. 6 Hurricanes squandered a 31\u20130 halftime lead against &lt;a href=\"1984%20Maryland%20Terrapins%20football%20team\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and lost 42\u201340 in what was then the biggest comeback in NCAA football history. The following week, Miami lost 47\u201345 when &lt;a href=\"1984%20Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football%20team\"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Doug%20Flutie\"&gt;Doug Flutie&lt;/a&gt; connected with &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Phelan\"&gt;Gerard Phelan&lt;/a&gt; for a 48-yard &lt;a href=\"Hail%20Mary%20pass\"&gt;Hail Mary&lt;/a&gt; touchdown on the final play in what has been called the &lt;a href=\"Hail%20Flutie\"&gt;Hail Flutie&lt;/a&gt; game. The Hurricanes ended the season on a three-game losing streak by dropping the &lt;a href=\"1985%20Fiesta%20Bowl\"&gt;1985 Fiesta Bowl&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1984%20UCLA%20Bruins%20football%20team\"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;, 39\u201337, in a game that featured six lead changes.\nDuring the off-season, Johnson made a number of coaching changes, facilitating the switch to the 4\u20133 defense, and junior &lt;a href=\"Vinny%20Testaverde\"&gt;Vinny Testaverde&lt;/a&gt; succeeded early-graduate &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Kosar\"&gt;Bernie Kosar&lt;/a&gt; at quarterback. The &lt;a href=\"1985%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1985 team&lt;/a&gt; opened the season with a loss at &lt;a href=\"1985%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; before winning their next four games, including a 38\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20football\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; that began a then NCAA-record 58 game home winning streak, heading into a matchup at No. 3 &lt;a href=\"1985%20Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football%20team\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. Facing the nation's top-rated defense, Testaverde amassed 270 yards passing and threw touchdowns to &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Irvin\"&gt;Michael Irvin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Blades\"&gt;Brian Blades&lt;/a&gt;, while also running for an additional score, in a 27\u201314 win over the Sooners. The Hurricanes ascended to number two in the rankings following a 58\u20137 victory over &lt;a href=\"1985%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football%20team\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; in the final game of the regular season, earning a trip to the &lt;a href=\"1986%20Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt; to play the No. 8 &lt;a href=\"1985%20Tennessee%20Volunteers%20football%20team\"&gt;Tennessee Volunteers&lt;/a&gt;. With No. 1 &lt;a href=\"1985%20Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football%20team\"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; losing to Oklahoma in the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, Miami was in position to capture its second &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20National%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;national championship&lt;/a&gt;, but those hopes were dashed with a lopsided 35\u20137 loss to Tennessee.\nMiami opened &lt;a href=\"1986%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;its 1986 season&lt;/a&gt; as the third-ranked team in the country and climbed to number two after winning its first three games, setting up a No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown at the Orange Bowl against top-ranked and defending national champion &lt;a href=\"1986%20Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football%20team\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. After much pre-game &lt;a href=\"trash-talk\"&gt;trash-talk&lt;/a&gt; between Oklahoma's &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Bosworth\"&gt;Brian Bosworth&lt;/a&gt; and Miami's &lt;a href=\"Melvin%20Bratton\"&gt;Melvin Bratton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alonzo%20Highsmith\"&gt;Alonzo Highsmith&lt;/a&gt;, Testaverde tossed four touchdown passes in a 28\u201316 win. Testaverde's performance led Oklahoma head coach &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Switzer\"&gt;Barry Switzer&lt;/a&gt; to remark that he had \"never seen a better quarterback\" in his 21 years with the Sooners, and at the conclusion of the regular season, Testaverde was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt; with the fifth largest margin of victory in the voting's history. The Hurricanes, having seized the number one ranking with the win over Oklahoma, finished the regular season at 11\u20130, outscoring their opponents 420\u2013136, and accepted a bid to the &lt;a href=\"1987%20Fiesta%20Bowl\"&gt;1987 Fiesta Bowl&lt;/a&gt; to play No. 2 &lt;a href=\"1986%20Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football%20team\"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt;. There, the team's \"outlaw\" image grew when players like &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Sileo\"&gt;Dan Sileo&lt;/a&gt; was doing interviews in a Hells Angel jacket, plus arriving in Arizona clad in &lt;a href=\"battledress\"&gt;fatigues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jerome%20Brown\"&gt;Jerome Brown&lt;/a&gt; staged a walkout of a pre-game steak fry attended by both teams. Before an estimated television audience of 70 million people, &lt;a href=\"Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football\"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; upset the heavily favored Hurricanes 14\u201310 to win the national championship, forcing seven turnovers, including Pete Giftopoulus' game-sealing interception of Testaverde in the end zone in the game's final seconds.\nLed by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Irvin\"&gt;Michael Irvin&lt;/a&gt; and new quarterback &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Walsh%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Steve Walsh&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"1987%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1987 Miami Hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; won the school's second national championship and completed its first undefeated varsity season. The season was highlighted by one of the most memorable games in the history of the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20%E2%80%93%20Florida%20State%20rivalry\"&gt;Miami \u2013 Florida State rivalry&lt;/a&gt;. Trailing No. 4 &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; 19\u20133 in the third quarter at &lt;a href=\"Doak%20Campbell%20Stadium\"&gt;Doak Campbell Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, the Hurricanes rallied to take a 26\u201319 lead late in the fourth quarter on a 73-yard touchdown pass from Walsh to Irvin. Florida State responded with a touchdown in the final minute, but Seminoles head coach &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Bowden\"&gt;Bobby Bowden&lt;/a&gt; opted to go for two points and the win rather than kick the extra-point for a tie, and Miami's Bubba McDowell broke up the conversion pass in the end zone to preserve the 26\u201325 victory. More than 60 players on the combined rosters for the game went on to play in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;. The 12\u20130 campaign was capped by a 20\u201314 win over the then-No. 1 &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football\"&gt;Oklahoma Sooners&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=\"1988%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt; billed as \"The Game of the Century.\" The win was Miami's third over Oklahoma in the last three seasons, accounting for Oklahoma's only losses during that time period. The Hurricanes had a then-school record 12 players from the 1987 team selected in the &lt;a href=\"1988%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;following spring's NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;, including Irvin and &lt;a href=\"Bennie%20Blades\"&gt;Bennie Blades&lt;/a&gt;, but with Walsh returning in &lt;a href=\"1988%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;, the team gained the number one ranking with a season-opening 31\u20130 shutout of then-No. 1 Florida State at the Orange Bowl. The following week, Miami scored 17 points in the final 5 minutes and 23 seconds to top No. 4 &lt;a href=\"1988%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; 31\u201330 at &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Stadium\"&gt;Michigan Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Hopes of a repeat national championship were dashed, however, in the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Catholics%20vs.%20Convicts\"&gt;Catholics vs. Convicts&lt;/a&gt;\" game, with Miami dropping an emotional 31\u201330 loss to &lt;a href=\"1988%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football%20team\"&gt;eventual-national champion Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; on a failed two-point conversion pass in the final minute. Johnson left the program in February 1989 to become the head coach of the NFL's &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Cowboys\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;, ending his tenure at Miami with a 52\u20139 overall record and a 44\u20134 mark over his last four seasons.\nDennis Erickson era (1989\u20131994).\nDespite having the support of students, players, and even the Miami police and fire departments, &lt;a href=\"offensive%20coordinator\"&gt;offensive coordinator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Stevens%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Gary Stevens&lt;/a&gt; was bypassed for the head coaching job and athletic director &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Jankovich\"&gt;Sam Jankovich&lt;/a&gt; chose &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Erickson\"&gt;Dennis Erickson&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20Cougars%20football\"&gt;Washington State&lt;/a&gt; to succeed &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Johnson%20%28American%20football%20coach%29\"&gt;Jimmy Johnson&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1989%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;, Erickson became just the second &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;Division I&lt;/a&gt; head coach to win a &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20National%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;national championship&lt;/a&gt; in his first season at a school. Erickson's &lt;a href=\"1989%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1989 team&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Erickson\"&gt;Craig Erickson&lt;/a&gt; (no relation) at quarterback, rebounded from a 24-10 mid-season loss at &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; and moved back into the national championship picture with a 27\u201310 win over then-top-ranked &lt;a href=\"1989%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football%20team\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; in the final regular-season game. Miami's 33\u201325 win over No. 7 &lt;a href=\"1989%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, combined with No. 1 &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Buffaloes%20football\"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;'s loss to Notre Dame in the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, earned the program its third national championship.\nMiami entered the &lt;a href=\"1990%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt; as the number one team in the country, but a 28\u201321 upset loss to &lt;a href=\"Ty%20Detmer\"&gt;Ty Detmer&lt;/a&gt; and No. 16 &lt;a href=\"1990%20BYU%20Cougars%20football%20team\"&gt;BYU&lt;/a&gt; in the opener derailed both the team's national championship chances and Craig Erickson's nascent Heisman campaign. Later in the year, the Hurricanes lost to &lt;a href=\"1990%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football%20team\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; 29\u201320 in a game dubbed the \"Final Conflict\", as Notre Dame had decided to discontinue the 27-game rivalry, feeling the intensity of the series had reached an unhealthy level. Miami ended the season with a 46\u20133 &lt;a href=\"1991%20Cotton%20Bowl%20Classic\"&gt;Cotton Bowl Classic&lt;/a&gt; victory over No. 3 &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Longhorns%20football\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1991%20Cotton%20Bowl%20Classic\"&gt;1991 Cotton Bowl Classic&lt;/a&gt; in which the team was penalized a bowl- and school-record 16 times for 202 yards, including nine unsportsmanlike conduct or personal foul penalties. On one play, &lt;a href=\"Randal%20Hill\"&gt;Randal Hill&lt;/a&gt; scored on a 48-yard touchdown reception and continued to sprint out of the end zone and up the &lt;a href=\"Cotton%20Bowl%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;Cotton Bowl&lt;/a&gt; tunnel, where he then pretended to shoot at the Longhorns with imaginary pistols. The program was widely criticized for its conduct, with &lt;a href=\"Will%20McDonough\"&gt;Will McDonough&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Boston%20Globe\"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt;\" likening the Cotton Bowl Classic display to a \"wilding\" and &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Walsh%20%28American%20football%20coach%29\"&gt;Bill Walsh&lt;/a&gt; calling it \"the most disgusting thing [he'd] ever seen in college sports.\" After the season, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; responded with the so-called \"Miami Rule\", which made it a 15-yard penalty to engage in excessive celebration or flagrant taunting. Also during the off-season, Miami ended its 48-year status as an &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20independent%20schools\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29\"&gt;Big East Conference&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1991%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1991 Hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; finished 12\u20130 and captured the program's fourth national championship in nine years behind quarterback &lt;a href=\"Gino%20Torretta\"&gt;Gino Torretta&lt;/a&gt; and a linebacking corps that featured &lt;a href=\"Jessie%20Armstead\"&gt;Jessie Armstead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Micheal%20Barrow\"&gt;Micheal Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. Miami's toughest test came in mid-November at then-No. 1 &lt;a href=\"1991%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; in the initial &lt;a href=\"Wide%20Right%20I\"&gt;Wide Right&lt;/a&gt; game; with the No. 2 Hurricanes leading 17\u201316 in the final minute of the game, Florida State kicker Gerry Thomas' potential game-winning field goal attempt sailed \"wide right\" of the uprights. Miami completed the second undefeated season in school history with a 22\u20130 shutout of No. 11 &lt;a href=\"1991%20Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football%20team\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1992%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;1992 Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt; and finished first in the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Poll\"&gt;AP Poll&lt;/a&gt;, splitting the national championship with &lt;a href=\"Coaches%27%20Poll\"&gt;Coaches' Poll&lt;/a&gt; champ &lt;a href=\"1991%20Washington%20Huskies%20football%20team\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Andrew\"&gt;Hurricane Andrew&lt;/a&gt; devastated much of &lt;a href=\"South%20Florida\"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt; in August 1992, causing the program to relocate its preseason practice sessions north to &lt;a href=\"Dodgertown\"&gt;Dodgertown&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vero%20Beach%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Vero Beach&lt;/a&gt;. That season, &lt;a href=\"1992%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;Miami went 11\u20130&lt;/a&gt; against the second-toughest schedule in the country, topping No. 3 &lt;a href=\"1992%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wide%20Right%20II\"&gt;Wide Right II&lt;/a&gt; and No. 7 &lt;a href=\"1992%20Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football%20team\"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; the following week in &lt;a href=\"Beaver%20Stadium\"&gt;Beaver Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Torretta became the second Hurricane to win the &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, throwing for 19 touchdowns and 3,060 yards on the season and setting 11 school passing records during his career. Miami earned a trip to the &lt;a href=\"1993%20Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;1993 Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, where the top-ranked and heavily favored Hurricanes were denied a repeat national championship by No. 2 &lt;a href=\"1992%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, 34\u201313. The Sugar Bowl loss ended the program's 29-game winning streak, which dated to 1990. The Hurricanes were frequently thrown off their rhythm by Alabama's 11-man fronts. Torretta threw three interceptions, one fewer than he had all season, in what would be the only loss of his collegiate career. After the 1992 season, defensive coordinator &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Lubick\"&gt;Sonny Lubick&lt;/a&gt; left to take the head coaching position at &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20State%20Rams%20football\"&gt;Colorado State&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough it was not apparent at the time, the Sugar Bowl loss marked the start of a downturn in Miami's fortunes. In &lt;a href=\"1993%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;, the Hurricanes lost three games in a season for the first time since 1984, failed to win the Big East for the first time since joining in 1991, and was shut out in the &lt;a href=\"1994%20Fiesta%20Bowl\"&gt;Fiesta Bowl&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"1993%20Arizona%20Wildcats%20football%20team\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, still the worst loss Miami has ever suffered in a bowl game. This led observers to wonder whether the Hurricanes were in decline. In &lt;a href=\"1994%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;, Miami defeated &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Southern%20Eagles%20football\"&gt;Georgia Southern&lt;/a&gt; in the season opener for its 58th consecutive home win, setting an NCAA record. The streak, which began in 1985, was snapped two weeks later when &lt;a href=\"1994%20Washington%20Huskies%20football%20team\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Hurricanes 38\u201320 at the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20All-America%20Team\"&gt;All-American&lt;/a&gt; defensive tackle &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Sapp\"&gt;Warren Sapp&lt;/a&gt; and sophomore linebacker &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Lewis%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Ray Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, the team rebounded to earn a berth in the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;1995 Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, where No. 1 &lt;a href=\"1994%20Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football%20team\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; outscored Miami 15\u20130 in the final quarter to win the game, 24\u201317, and the national championship. With the threat of NCAA sanctions hovering over the program for a variety of infractions, Erickson stepped down after the 1994 season to become head coach of the NFL's &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Seahawks\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt;. Erickson departed Miami with a 63\u20139 record over six seasons and the highest winning percentage (.875) and most national championships (2) of any coach in school history.\nButch Davis era (1995\u20132000).\nFollowing Erickson's departure, Miami initially pursued former UM defensive coordinator and then-&lt;a href=\"Colorado%20State%20Rams%20football\"&gt;Colorado State&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Lubick\"&gt;Sonny Lubick&lt;/a&gt;; however, he withdrew from consideration and opted to remain with the Rams. Eventually, Miami settled on another former Hurricanes defensive assistant coach, then-&lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Cowboys\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; defensive coordinator &lt;a href=\"Butch%20Davis\"&gt;Butch Davis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hurricanes finished &lt;a href=\"1995%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;Davis's first season&lt;/a&gt; with a record of 8\u20133. However, on December 20, 1995, the NCAA announced that Miami would be subject to severe sanctions for numerous infractions within the athletic department. The Hurricanes were forced to sit out postseason play for the first time since 1982 and docked 31 scholarships from 1996 to 1998. Miami had actually self-reported the violations in 1991. However, when the Department of Education got word that school officials helped athletes fraudulently obtain &lt;a href=\"Pell%20Grant\"&gt;Pell Grant&lt;/a&gt;s, it asked Miami to stop its own investigation while it conducted its own. Ultimately, 60 athletes were implicated, but all of them avoided criminal charges after being sent through a pretrial diversion program. In 1994, Tony Russell, a former UM academic advisor, pleaded guilty to helping more than 80 student athletes, 57 of whom were football players, falsify Pell Grant applications in exchange for kickbacks from the players themselves. The scandal dated all the way back to 1989 and secured more than $220,000 in federal grant money. Federal officials later said that Russell had engineered \"perhaps the largest centralized fraud ... ever committed\" in the history of the Pell Grant program. In late 1995, the NCAA concluded that, in addition to the fraudulent Pell Grants facilitated by Russell, the university had also provided or allowed over $400,000 worth of other, improper payments to Miami football players. The NCAA also found that the university had failed to wholly implement its drug testing program, and permitted three football student-athletes to compete without being subject to the required disciplinary measures specified in the policy. The NCAA found that this was evidence that school officials didn't have adequate control over the football program. Miami docked itself seven scholarships as part of a self-imposed sanction in 1995, and the &lt;a href=\"NCAA\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; took away another 24 scholarships over the next two years. As a result of the scandal, \"&lt;a href=\"Sports%20Illustrated\"&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/a&gt;\"'s &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Wolff\"&gt;Alexander Wolff&lt;/a&gt; wrote a cover story that Miami should at least temporarily shut down its football program. Further, On June 21, 1996, Miami football players broke into the apartment of the captain of Miami's track team and struck him repeatedly. In response, Davis suspended three key players for the coming 1996 season, in which the Hurricanes finished 9\u20133. Davis also suspended two other players who were involved in separate violent incidents.\nThe low point for Miami came in &lt;a href=\"1997%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt; when they posted a 5\u20136 record, the first losing season since Howard Schnellenberger's first year in 1979. The 1997 season saw the Hurricanes suffer one of the program's most humiliating losses, a 47\u20130 beating at the hands of in-state rival &lt;a href=\"1997%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt;. The Hurricanes began to reassert themselves in &lt;a href=\"1998%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, when they finished 9\u20133. In late September, Miami was forced to postpone their game with &lt;a href=\"UCLA%20Bruins%20Football\"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Georges\"&gt;Hurricane Georges&lt;/a&gt;. The game was rescheduled for December 5 and for the number 2-ranked Bruins, a trip to the National Championship game was at stake. The Hurricanes rebounded from a 66\u201313 \"caning\" at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Syracuse%20Orange%20football\"&gt;Syracuse&lt;/a&gt; quarterback and &lt;a href=\"Donovan%20McNabb\"&gt;Donovan McNabb&lt;/a&gt; to put up over 600 yards of total offense against UCLA en route to a stunning 49\u201345 victory for the Hurricanes.\n&lt;a href=\"1999%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;The following season&lt;/a&gt; carried high hopes and expectations for the Hurricanes. They opened the year with a 23\u201312 win over &lt;a href=\"1999%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football%20team\"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Rutherford%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;East Rutherford&lt;/a&gt;. Early success, however, was tempered by tough losses to &lt;a href=\"1999%20Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football%20team\"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1999%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; during a three-game losing streak. The Hurricanes rebounded to win their last four games including a 28\u201313 win over &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gator%20Bowl\"&gt;Gator Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"2000%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, Miami was shut out of the &lt;a href=\"Bowl%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;BCS&lt;/a&gt; National Championship Game. Despite beating &lt;a href=\"2000%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; head-to-head and being ranked higher in both human polls, the Seminoles were chosen to challenge the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football%20team\"&gt;Oklahoma Sooners&lt;/a&gt; for the national championship. The Seminoles were also chosen over &lt;a href=\"2000%20Washington%20Huskies%20football%20team\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, who also had one loss and who had handed Miami its only loss early in the season. Washington had been ranked third or fourth in the human polls, behind Miami. The Hurricanes went into the &lt;a href=\"2001%20Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;2001 Nokia Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt; as the Big East champions and, after much pregame antics including a brawl between members of the two teams on Bourbon Street in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;New Orleans, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, defeated &lt;a href=\"2000%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; 37\u201320. On January 29, 2001, &lt;a href=\"Butch%20Davis\"&gt;Butch Davis&lt;/a&gt; left Miami to become head coach of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Browns\"&gt;Cleveland Browns&lt;/a&gt;.\nLarry Coker era (2001\u20132006).\nAfter being turned down by &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20Badgers%20football\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Alvarez\"&gt;Barry Alvarez&lt;/a&gt;, athletics director &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Dee\"&gt;Paul Dee&lt;/a&gt; promoted offensive coordinator &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Coker\"&gt;Larry Coker&lt;/a&gt; to head coach to replace Butch Davis.\nAngered at being snubbed by the BCS, the Hurricanes stormed through the &lt;a href=\"2001%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2001 season&lt;/a&gt;. They opened the season with a 33\u20137, nationally televised rout over &lt;a href=\"2001%20Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football%20team\"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Beaver%20Stadium\"&gt;Beaver Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Miami followed up the victory with equally decisive &lt;a href=\"Rutgers%20Scarlet%20Knights%20football\"&gt;Rutgers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Troy%20Trojans%20football\"&gt;Troy&lt;/a&gt;. After building up a 4\u20130 record, the Hurricanes defeated &lt;a href=\"2001%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Doak%20Campbell%20Stadium\"&gt;Doak Campbell Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, 49\u201327, ending the Seminoles' 54-game home unbeaten streak. The Hurricanes then defeated &lt;a href=\"2001%20West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football%20team\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, 45\u20133, and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Owls%20football\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;, 38\u20130, before heading to &lt;a href=\"Chestnut%20Hill%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Chestnut Hill&lt;/a&gt; to take on &lt;a href=\"Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football\"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt;. In the final minute of the fourth quarter, with Miami clinging to a 12\u20137 lead, Boston College quarterback &lt;a href=\"Brian%20St.%20Pierre\"&gt;Brian St. Pierre&lt;/a&gt; led the Eagles from their own 30-yard line all the way down to the Hurricanes' 9. With BC on the verge of a momentous upset, St. Pierre attempted a pass to receiver Ryan Read at the Miami 2-yard line. However, the ball deflected off the leg of Miami cornerback &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Rumph\"&gt;Mike Rumph&lt;/a&gt;, landing in the hands of defensive end Matt Walters. Walters ran ten yards with the ball before teammate &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Reed\"&gt;Ed Reed&lt;/a&gt; grabbed the ball out of his hands at around the Miami 20-yard line and raced the remaining 80-yards for a touchdown, resulting in an 18\u20137 Miami victory. After surviving this scare, Miami shutout No. 14 &lt;a href=\"Syracuse%20Orange%20football\"&gt;Syracuse&lt;/a&gt;, 59\u20130, and defeated No. 12 &lt;a href=\"2001%20Washington%20Huskies%20football%20team\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, 65\u20137 in the Orange Bowl. The combined 124\u20137 score set what the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Sentinel\"&gt;Orlando Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; described as an NCAA-record for the largest margin of victory over consecutive ranked opponents. The final hurdle to the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Rose%20Bowl\"&gt;2002 Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;BCS National Championship Game&lt;/a&gt; was at &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;. Miami jumped on Virginia Tech early, leading 20\u20133 at halftime, and 26\u201310 in the fourth quarter. But despite being outgained by the Hurricanes by 134 yards and being dominated in time-of-possession, the Hokies never quit. Virginia Tech added a couple of late touchdowns, attempting two-point conversions on each. The first conversion was successful, pulling them to 26\u201318, but receiver &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Wilford\"&gt;Ernest Wilford&lt;/a&gt; dropped a pass from quarterback Grant Noel in the endzone for the second conversion. Still, the resilient Hokies had one more chance to win the game late, taking possession of the ball at midfield and needing only a field goal to take the lead. But a diving, game-saving interception by &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Reed\"&gt;Ed Reed&lt;/a&gt; sealed the Miami victory, 26\u201324. Defeating Virginia Tech earned the top-ranked Hurricanes an invitation to the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Rose%20Bowl\"&gt;2002 Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt; to take on BCS No. 2 &lt;a href=\"2001%20Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football%20team\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; for the national championship. In the Rose Bowl, the Hurricanes took a 34\u20130 halftime lead and cruised to a 37\u201314 win over the Huskers to capture their fifth national championship and put the finishing touches on a perfect 12\u20130 season. The Miami defense shut down &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Crouch\"&gt;Eric Crouch&lt;/a&gt; and the vaunted Huskers offense, holding Nebraska 200 yards below its season average. &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Dorsey\"&gt;Ken Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andre%20Johnson\"&gt;Andre Johnson&lt;/a&gt; were named &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Bowl%20%28game%29\"&gt;Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt; co-Most Valuable Players. Six Hurricane players earned All-American status and six players were finalists for national awards, including &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Award\"&gt;Maxwell Award&lt;/a&gt; winner, &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Dorsey\"&gt;Ken Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Outland%20Trophy\"&gt;Outland Trophy&lt;/a&gt; winner, &lt;a href=\"Bryant%20McKinnie\"&gt;Bryant McKinnie&lt;/a&gt;. Dorsey was also a &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt; finalist, finishing third. The &lt;a href=\"2001%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2001 Miami Hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; are considered by some experts and historians as one of the greatest teams in college football history.\nMiami started the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2002 season&lt;/a&gt; as the defending national champion and the No. 1 ranked team in the country. Behind a high-powered offense led by senior quarterback &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Dorsey\"&gt;Ken Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;, new starting running back &lt;a href=\"Willis%20McGahee\"&gt;Willis McGahee&lt;/a&gt;, and a stout defense anchored by &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Vilma\"&gt;Jonathan Vilma&lt;/a&gt;, the Hurricanes completed their regular season schedule undefeated. The season was highlighted by a 41\u201316 win over rival &lt;a href=\"2002%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Hill%20Griffin%20Stadium\"&gt;Ben Hill Griffin Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, the first regular season meeting between the rivals since 1987. The Hurricanes' toughest test was an October clash against rival &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Miami overcame a 13-point second half deficit to defeat the Seminoles, 28\u201327. The game was clinched when &lt;a href=\"2002%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; kicker &lt;a href=\"Xavier%20Beitia\"&gt;Xavier Beitia&lt;/a&gt; missed a 43-yard field goal, wide left, as time expired. Another signature win came four weeks later when Miami dominated the &lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20Volunteers%20football\"&gt;Tennessee Volunteers&lt;/a&gt;, 26\u20133, before a crowd of 107,745 at &lt;a href=\"Neyland%20Stadium\"&gt;Neyland Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, considered one of the most hostile road venues in college football. Miami would finish 12\u20130 and clinch a berth in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Fiesta%20Bowl\"&gt;Fiesta Bowl&lt;/a&gt; BCS National Championship Game after a wild 56\u201345 victory over Virginia Tech in which McGahee rushed for 205 yards and a school-record six touchdowns. Both Dorsey and McGahee were named as finalists for the Heisman Trophy, finishing 4th and 5th, respectively. Miami, in the midst of a 34-game winning streak, was installed as a 13-point favorite in the Fiesta Bowl match up against No. 2 &lt;a href=\"2002%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football%20team\"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt;. The Hurricanes took an early 7\u20130 lead on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Dorsey to &lt;a href=\"Roscoe%20Parrish\"&gt;Roscoe Parrish&lt;/a&gt;, but Ohio State seized control in the second quarter behind an aggressive pass rush, bolstered by constant &lt;a href=\"blitz%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;blitzing&lt;/a&gt;, and a stifling rush defense. The Buckeyes held a 14\u20137 lead at the half, and a field goal by &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Nugent\"&gt;Mike Nugent&lt;/a&gt; extended Ohio State's advantage to 17\u20137 midway through the third quarter. A touchdown run by McGahee brought the Hurricanes within 3 points, but he suffered a knee injury early in the fourth quarter. Miami was able to fight back and force overtime on a 40-yard field goal by Todd Sievers on the final play of the fourth quarter, aided by several questionable calls. Miami scored a touchdown on its first possession in overtime on a 7-yard pass from Dorsey to &lt;a href=\"Kellen%20Winslow%20II\"&gt;Kellen Winslow II&lt;/a&gt;, and, on Ohio State's ensuing possession, the Hurricanes appeared to have won the game, 24\u201317, after Buckeyes quarterback &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Krenzel\"&gt;Craig Krenzel&lt;/a&gt;'s fourth-and-3 pass from the Miami 5 fell incomplete in the end zone. Miami players and coaches rushed the field and stadium fireworks were set off to commemorate the program's apparent sixth national championship. The celebration proved premature. At the conclusion of the play, Big 12 official Terry Porter threw a flag and made a controversial &lt;a href=\"pass%20interference\"&gt;pass interference&lt;/a&gt; call against Miami cornerback &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Sharpe\"&gt;Glenn Sharpe&lt;/a&gt;. The penalty took the air out of Miami's sails and gave Ohio State new life, first-and-goal at the 1. The Buckeyes scored a touchdown to tie it at 24\u201324 at the end of the first overtime, and &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Clarett\"&gt;Maurice Clarett&lt;/a&gt;'s 5-yard touchdown run in the second overtime gave Ohio State a 31\u201324 lead. Miami's ensuing possession saw Dorsey briefly knocked out of the game after a hit from linebacker &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Matt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;. After backup quarterback &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20Crudup\"&gt;Derrick Crudup&lt;/a&gt; completed an 8-yard pass on third down, Dorsey re-entered and converted the crucial fourth-and-3 with a 7-yard completion to Winslow. Miami then drove to the Ohio State 2 yard-line, but was held to one yard on its next three plays, giving &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football\"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt; the national championship.\nMiami suffered through some offensive struggles in &lt;a href=\"2003%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; behind new quarterback &lt;a href=\"Brock%20Berlin\"&gt;Brock Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. A blowout loss at &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt; in early November ended Miami's 39-game regular season winning streak and a loss the following week to &lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20Volunteers%20football\"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; ended Miami's national championship aspirations. The Hurricanes rebounded to win the Big East Conference championship and finish the season 11\u20132 with an &lt;a href=\"2004%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;2004 Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt; victory over &lt;a href=\"2003%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiami joined the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;ACC&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 and despite 3 conference losses, the Hurricanes ended the season with a &lt;a href=\"2004%20Peach%20Bowl%20%28December%29\"&gt;Peach Bowl&lt;/a&gt; victory over rival &lt;a href=\"2004%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2005%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; season marked the debut of &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Wright\"&gt;Kyle Wright&lt;/a&gt; as Miami's starting quarterback, although the much-ballyhooed Wright would struggle with consistency during the season with much of Miami's success that year fueled by its defense. After a loss to &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; after placekick holder &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Monroe\"&gt;Bryan Monroe&lt;/a&gt; bobbled the snap for what would have been a game-tying field goal attempt, Miami would win eight straight games, including a road win over No. 3 &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;, only to stumble two weeks later against underdog &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt;. Miami's second conference loss of the season cost it a place in the inaugural ACC Championship game and it competed instead in the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Chick-fil-A%20Bowl\"&gt;Peach Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, where it lost to &lt;a href=\"LSU%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;LSU&lt;/a&gt;, 40\u20133. 2005 also saw the program embroiled in more controversy when it was reported several Miami football players had recorded a rap song in 2004 that contained lewd sexual references. The song, recorded by an informal group that called itself \"7th Floor Crew\" and set to the beat of &lt;a href=\"Aaliyah\"&gt;Aaliyah&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"If%20Your%20Girl%20Only%20Knew\"&gt;If Your Girl Only Knew&lt;/a&gt;\", received much criticism in outlets such as &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Sports%20Illustrated\"&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/a&gt;\". Following the negative publicity, the university issued a statement condemning its lyrical content.\nThe Hurricanes went 7\u20136 during a &lt;a href=\"2006%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2006 season&lt;/a&gt; that included an &lt;a href=\"Miami-FIU%20brawl\"&gt;on-field brawl&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"FIU%20Golden%20Panthers%20football\"&gt;Florida International&lt;/a&gt;, the shooting death of Miami defensive tackle &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Pata\"&gt;Bryan Pata&lt;/a&gt;, and a four-game late-season losing streak. Only a &lt;a href=\"Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; night victory over &lt;a href=\"Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football\"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt;, in Miami's last game of the regular season, saved the Hurricanes from a losing regular season record. The day following the Boston College victory, university president &lt;a href=\"Donna%20Shalala\"&gt;Donna Shalala&lt;/a&gt; fired Coker. Coker coached through the postseason, where he won his final game, a 21\u201320 victory over &lt;a href=\"Nevada%20Wolf%20Pack%20football\"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; on December 31, 2006, in the &lt;a href=\"2006%20MPC%20Computers%20Bowl\"&gt;MPC Computers Bowl&lt;/a&gt;.\nRandy Shannon era (2007\u20132010).\nAfter a search that lasted two weeks, Miami athletics director &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Dee\"&gt;Paul Dee&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"defensive%20coordinator\"&gt;defensive coordinator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Randy%20Shannon\"&gt;Randy Shannon&lt;/a&gt;, a starting linebacker on the 1987 national champions, as the Hurricanes' 22nd head coach on December 8, 2006. Shannon reportedly agreed to a four-year deal worth over $4 million. His hiring made him the first &lt;a href=\"African%20American\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; head coach in Miami football history. One of Shannon's first acts as head coach was to impose a strict code of conduct for the team enacted in large part due to the misbehavior, arrests and shenanigans of Miami players during Larry Coker's tenure as head coach.\nShannon's first year as UM head coach in &lt;a href=\"2007%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; was one of the worst in the Hurricanes' modern history, with the team registering a losing 5\u20137 record. Under Shannon, the team failed to reach a bowl game for the first time in a decade. Notably, it was the first time in 25 years that the Hurricanes had missed a bowl game with a full complement of scholarships.\nMedia draft experts considered the freshmen on the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2008 team&lt;/a&gt; to be one of the top recruiting classes in the nation. The 2008 season resulted in a 7\u20136 record. The regular season was highlighted by losses to rivals &lt;a href=\"2008%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2008%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an upset victory over &lt;a href=\"2008%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;. The 26\u20133 loss to Florida was Miami's first in that series since 1985, snapping a 6-game winning streak against the Gators. Afterwards, the tension between the two teams was heightened when Shannon accused Florida coach &lt;a href=\"Urban%20Meyer\"&gt;Urban Meyer&lt;/a&gt; of trying to run up the score with an unsuccessful deep pass into the end zone in the game's final minute. The visiting Hurricanes were 22\u00bd point underdogs in the nationally televised game but only trailed 9\u20133 heading into the fourth quarter, leading some to wonder whether Meyer was trying to compensate for his team's unimpressive performance before kicking a &lt;a href=\"Field%20goal%20%28football%29\"&gt;field goal&lt;/a&gt; with :25 remaining.\" Miami was knocked out of &lt;a href=\"2008%20ACC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;ACC Championship&lt;/a&gt; contention with a late-season loss to &lt;a href=\"2008%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football%20team\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt; in which the Hurricanes surrendered the second-most rushing yards in school history (472). The Hurricanes finished the 2008 season with a 24\u201317 loss to &lt;a href=\"2008%20California%20Golden%20Bears%20football%20team\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Emerald%20Bowl\"&gt;Emerald Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. After the 2008 season, Shannon fired offensive coordinator &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Nix\"&gt;Patrick Nix&lt;/a&gt;, citing philosophical differences. Also, starting quarterback &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Marve\"&gt;Robert Marve&lt;/a&gt; left the team because he claimed not to be able to play for Coach Shannon. Shannon placed strict restrictions on Marve's potential transfer destinations and received much criticism in the media. However, the University of Miami claimed in a press release that the restrictions were set because of suspected tampering by Marve's family or others on behalf of the Marve family. Shannon's staff suffered more upheaval when defensive coordinator &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Young\"&gt;Bill Young&lt;/a&gt; left to assume the same position at &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20State%20Cowboys%20football\"&gt;Oklahoma State&lt;/a&gt;, his alma mater, in late January 2009. &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; assistant &lt;a href=\"John%20Lovett%20%28American%20football%20coach%29\"&gt;John Lovett&lt;/a&gt; was hired to replace him. Shannon hired former &lt;a href=\"UMass%20Minutemen%20football\"&gt;UMass&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Whipple\"&gt;Mark Whipple&lt;/a&gt; as Miami's new offensive coordinator and associate head coach. Several Miami offensive players from the 2008 season returned, including quarterback &lt;a href=\"Jacory%20Harris\"&gt;Jacory Harris&lt;/a&gt;, both starting running backs, most of the offensive line and its top six receivers. Shannon has been able to recruit a number of Southern Florida's top high school football players by telling them that they would be able to play immediately. In fact, 21 &lt;a href=\"true%20freshmen\"&gt;true freshmen&lt;/a&gt; played during the 2008 season opener.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2009%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2009 season&lt;/a&gt; began on a poor note after two back up quarterbacks, &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20Cook\"&gt;Taylor Cook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cannon%20Smith\"&gt;Cannon Smith&lt;/a&gt; both transferred out during fall practice, leaving the young Hurricane team with only one serviceable backup in true freshman &lt;a href=\"A.J.%20Highsmith\"&gt;A.J. Highsmith&lt;/a&gt;. Sophomore &lt;a href=\"Jacory%20Harris\"&gt;Jacory Harris&lt;/a&gt; directed the newly implemented offense. To make matters worse, starting defensive end &lt;a href=\"Adewale%20Ojomo\"&gt;Adewale Ojomo&lt;/a&gt; suffered a broken jaw in a locker room fight that led to a season-ending injury, causing the already young Hurricane team to go into their season short handed. Miami faced a difficult schedule to start the 2009 season with visits to No. 18 &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt;, a home game against No. 15 &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt;, a visit to &lt;a href=\"Lane%20Stadium\"&gt;Lane Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and the No. 7 Virginia Tech Hokies and a home visit from the defending &lt;a href=\"Big%2012%20Conference\"&gt;Big 12 Conference&lt;/a&gt; champions and BCS Champion runners-up in No. 3 &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. Some national media outlets and sites such as &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; predicted at best a 2\u20132 record for the Hurricanes with some even predicting an 0\u20134 start. Miami opened up their 2009 season against &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Labor%20Day\"&gt;Labor Day&lt;/a&gt; night for a national broadcast for ESPN. Billed as a \"Battle of Rebuilding Programs\", Quarterback Jacory Harris led a heroic comeback in Tallahassee to beat the then ranked Seminoles 38\u201334, overcoming a late interception and apparent injury to Harris in the 4th quarter. The next week, Miami welcomed the &lt;a href=\"triple%20option\"&gt;triple option&lt;/a&gt; offense of the No. 14 &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets\"&gt;Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets&lt;/a&gt; in yet another ESPN prime-time game. Georgia Tech came in hot off of a big ACC win against &lt;a href=\"Clemson%20University\"&gt;Clemson University&lt;/a&gt; the previous week and held a 4\u20130 record against the Hurricanes in the last 4 years, including the previous years pounding in Atlanta (referenced above). The 2009 contest would be a different story all together, as the Hurricanes handily beat the Jackets 33\u201317 at home and allowed only 95 rushing yards in the process. The next week, with the Hurricanes in the national spotlight for the first time in 5 years, the No. 9 Miami team visited the No. 11 &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies\"&gt;Virginia Tech Hokies&lt;/a&gt;. In pouring rain, Tech defeated the Hurricanes by a final score of 31\u20137. Beat up and embarrassed, Miami then played &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. Without &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Award\"&gt;Heisman Award&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Bradford\"&gt;Sam Bradford&lt;/a&gt;, Oklahoma took an early 10\u20130 lead after two early Jacory Harris interceptions. Going into halftime, the Hurricanes trailed the Sooners 10\u20137 in a highly contested football game. Miami came out for the second with a huge hit on the kick off team by &lt;a href=\"Cory%20Nelms\"&gt;Cory Nelms&lt;/a&gt; that forced the Sooners to start inside their own 20. The following play, Sophomore Corner &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Harris\"&gt;Brandon Harris&lt;/a&gt; hit Oklahoma Quarterback &lt;a href=\"Landry%20Jones\"&gt;Landry Jones&lt;/a&gt; and forced a fumble that eventually led to a Hurricane touchdown. The momentum stayed with the Hurricanes as they rode to a 21\u201320 win over the No. 8 team in the country. Following the opening four weeks, Miami was 3\u20131 and was the talk of sports stations nationwide. Following the gauntlet first third of the season, the Hurricanes won against &lt;a href=\"Florida%20A%26amp%3BM\"&gt;Florida A&amp;M&lt;/a&gt; at home and on the road against in-state foe &lt;a href=\"UCF%20Knights%20football\"&gt;UCF&lt;/a&gt;, moving all the way up to No. 10 in the polls. The Canes then had to take on &lt;a href=\"Clemson%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Clemson&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Miami%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Miami, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, in what was a contest of speed and athleticism. Turnovers, missed opportunities and stand-out back &lt;a href=\"C.%20J.%20Spiller\"&gt;C. J. Spiller&lt;/a&gt; led the Tigers to a 40\u201337 overtime win against the Hurricanes, knocking them out of BCS contention and putting the &lt;a href=\"ACC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;ACC Championship Game&lt;/a&gt; in serious jeopardy. A win against &lt;a href=\"Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20football\"&gt;Wake Forest&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Halloween\"&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt; kept the Hurricanes in the conference race, which they followed up on with a 52\u201317 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; in Miami. The next week &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, led by former Miami head coach &lt;a href=\"Butch%20Davis\"&gt;Butch Davis&lt;/a&gt;, topped Miami 33\u201324 with an unimpressive performance by Jacory Harris and the offense. Miami finished up the 2009 regular season with back-to-back wins over &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; and in-state opponent &lt;a href=\"South%20Florida%20Bulls%20football\"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt;. Miami's final record was 9\u20133, finishing in 3rd place for the &lt;a href=\"ACC%20Coastal%20Division\"&gt;ACC Coastal Division&lt;/a&gt; behind &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement of the 2009 bowl selections stirred some controversy. Instead of choosing the 3rd best team in the ACC (Miami), &lt;a href=\"Gator%20Bowl\"&gt;Gator Bowl&lt;/a&gt; officials chose &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; to represent the ACC against &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; instead of the Hurricanes because of the retirement of legendary FSU coach &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Bowden\"&gt;Bobby Bowden&lt;/a&gt;, who served as West Virginia's head coach from 1970 to 1975. The Hurricanes were relegated to the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Champs%20Sports%20Bowl\"&gt;2009 Champs Sports Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orlando%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Orlando, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, to play against the 9\u20133 &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20Badgers\"&gt;Wisconsin Badgers&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Hurricanes were heavy favorites coming into the contest, the Badgers beat up on the Hurricanes consistently throughout the game. The Hurricanes started off fast with a big return to open the game by &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Shields\"&gt;Sam Shields&lt;/a&gt;, but the Canes just could not maintain any offense throughout the game and had no answer for the power offense of Wisconsin. Going into halftime, the Hurricanes trailed 17\u20137 and &lt;a href=\"Graig%20Cooper\"&gt;Graig Cooper&lt;/a&gt; blew out his knee on the poor turf just before halftime on a kick off return. Though Miami scored a late touchdown and recovered the &lt;a href=\"onside%20kick\"&gt;onside kick&lt;/a&gt;, they fell to Wisconsin 20\u201314 and finished the season at 9\u20134. After the 2009 season, Shannon signed the No. 13 recruiting class in the nation according to ESPN. Shannon addressed many depth issues including offensive line, line backers and running backs, however the media claimed that the staff missed out on several of the more highly touted recruits on signing day, including a couple of \"5 star\" players. Coaching changes were made before and after signing day, including the departure of defensive line coach/recruiting coordinator &lt;a href=\"Clint%20Hurtt\"&gt;Clint Hurtt&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Louisville%20Cardinals%20football\"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt; and the loss of running backs coach &lt;a href=\"Tommie%20Robinson\"&gt;Tommie Robinson&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Cardinals\"&gt;Arizona Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;. Shannon replaced them with former Hurricane and &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Wildcats%20football\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; defensive line coach &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Petri\"&gt;Rick Petri&lt;/a&gt; as well as running back coach Mike Cassano from &lt;a href=\"Florida%20International%20University\"&gt;Florida International University&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, Shannon named wide-receiver coach &lt;a href=\"Aubry%20Hill\"&gt;Aubry Hill&lt;/a&gt; as the recruiting coordinator for the program. In May 2010, the university raised Randy Shannon's pay and extended Shannon's contract as head coach through 2014.\nThe Hurricanes finished the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2010 season&lt;/a&gt; with a 7\u20136 record which included losses to rivals &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt; as well as their first ever loss to in-state opponent &lt;a href=\"South%20Florida%20Bulls%20football\"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt; in the last game of the season. Shannon was fired by athletics director &lt;a href=\"Kirby%20Hocutt\"&gt;Kirby Hocutt&lt;/a&gt; after the loss to South Florida. Interim head coach &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Stoutland\"&gt;Jeff Stoutland&lt;/a&gt;, who was offensive line coach under Shannon, led the team into its &lt;a href=\"2010%20Sun%20Bowl\"&gt;2010 Sun Bowl&lt;/a&gt; matchup versus &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;; the Hurricanes lost the &lt;a href=\"New%20Year%27s%20Eve\"&gt;New Year's Eve&lt;/a&gt; game 33\u201317.\nAl Golden era (2011\u20132015).\nOn December 13, 2010, it was announced that athletics director &lt;a href=\"Kirby%20Hocutt\"&gt;Kirby Hocutt&lt;/a&gt; hired &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Owls%20football\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href=\"Al%20Golden\"&gt;Al Golden&lt;/a&gt; as the program's 23rd head coach. Golden was regarded as an up-and-coming coach who had turned around an abysmal Temple football program. Shortly after announcing Golden's hiring, Miami signed Golden to a five-year contract.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2011%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;, Golden's first season, the Hurricanes posted a 6\u20136 record. It was only the third time, since 1979, that the program had failed to register a winning record. The Hurricanes kicked off the season with a 32\u201324 loss to &lt;a href=\"Maryland%20Terrapins%20football\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. After upsetting No. 17 &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football\"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt;, the Hurricanes lost to &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football\"&gt;Kansas State&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of 28\u201324. Golden's team defeated in-state &lt;a href=\"Football%20Championship%20Subdivision\"&gt;FCS&lt;/a&gt; foe &lt;a href=\"Bethune%E2%80%93Cookman%20Wildcats%20football\"&gt;Bethune-Cookman&lt;/a&gt; on October 1 by a score of 45\u201314. After a close 38\u201335 loss to &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;, Miami defeated &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 30-24 and No. 20 &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 24\u20137. The Hurricanes alternated between win and loss for the remainder of the season; losing to &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; 28\u201321, defeating &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; 49\u201314, losing to archrival &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; 23-19 beating &lt;a href=\"South%20Florida%20Bulls%20football\"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt; in a 6-3 defensive struggle and losing to &lt;a href=\"Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football\"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 24\u201317. On November 25, 2011, Miami signed Golden to a raise and four-year contract extension through the 2019 season.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2012%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, the Hurricanes finished with a 7\u20135 mark. They started the season with a 41\u201332 victory over &lt;a href=\"Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football\"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt; on September 1. After a 52-13 blowout loss to &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football\"&gt;Kansas State&lt;/a&gt;, Golden's team won their next three; defeating &lt;a href=\"Bethune-Cookman%20Wildcats%20football\"&gt;Bethune-Cookman&lt;/a&gt; 38\u201310, &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt; 42-36 and &lt;a href=\"NC%20State%20Wolfpack%20football\"&gt;NC State&lt;/a&gt; 44\u201337. Next, however, the Hurricanes lost their next three; dropping a 41-3 blowout to No. 9 &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;, an 18-14 struggle to &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, and a 33\u201320 loss to No. 12 &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt;. On November 1, Miami defeated &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 30\u201312. After a heartbreaking 41\u201340 loss to &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, the Hurricanes won their last two; dominating &lt;a href=\"South%20Florida%20Bulls%20football\"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt; 40-9 and outlasting &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 52\u201345. This resulted in a three-way tie, with &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt;, for the best record in the ACC Coastal Division. &lt;a href=\"2012%20North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football%20team\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, which had defeated the Hurricanes earlier in the season, would have been declared the coastal division champion based on the ACC tie breaker formula. However, due to &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; sanctions, they were ineligible for postseason play. Miami finished in second place based on the formula. However, due to likely pending NCAA sanctions from the &lt;a href=\"2011%20University%20of%20Miami%20athletics%20scandal\"&gt;Nevin Shapiro scandal&lt;/a&gt;, the university's administration preemptively chose to forego post-season play for the second consecutive year. Had they played, it would have marked their only appearance in the ACC championship game, since joining the conference, in 2004. It would also have set up a rematch with &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt;, who had defeated the Hurricanes earlier in the season.\nThe Hurricanes compiled a 9\u20134 record in &lt;a href=\"2013%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;. Golden's team came storming out of the gate, winning their first seven; a 34\u20136 win over in-state opponent &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Atlantic%20Owls%20football\"&gt;Florida Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;, a 21\u201316 win over rival &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Gators%20football\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, a 77-7 thrashing of &lt;a href=\"Football%20Championship%20Subdivision\"&gt;FCS&lt;/a&gt; opponent &lt;a href=\"Savannah%20State%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Savannah State&lt;/a&gt;, a 49\u201321 victory over &lt;a href=\"South%20Florida%20Bulls%20football\"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt;, a 45\u201330 win over &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt;, a 27-23 close win over &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and a 24-21 nail biter over &lt;a href=\"Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20football\"&gt;Wake Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The Hurricanes suffered their first loss of the 2013 season on November 2, losing to No. 3 &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; in a 41-14 thrashing. Miami dropped a second straight game by way of a 42\u201324 loss to &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt; and a third consecutive loss to &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; in a 48-30 disappointment dropped the Hurricanes from a No. 7 national ranking to unranked in those three weeks. The Hurricanes were able to close out the regular season with two wins, defeating &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; 45-26 and &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; 41\u201331. Miami received a berth in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Russell%20Athletic%20Bowl\"&gt;2013 Russell Athletic Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, a game they lost to No. 18 &lt;a href=\"Louisville%20Cardinals%20football\"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt; in a 36-9 blowout. In October 2013, after an investigation spanning two and a half years, the NCAA announced that \"the committee acknowledged and accepted the extensive and significant self-imposed penalties by the university.\" Therefore, no further bowl ban would be enforced. As a result, Miami was eligible to compete in ACC championship and BCS bowls for the 2013\u201314 season. However, the NCAA stripped Miami of nine scholarships over three years.\nThe Hurricanes went 6\u20137 in &lt;a href=\"2014%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;. Miami kicked off the season with a 31\u201313 loss to No. 25 &lt;a href=\"Louisville%20Cardinals%20football\"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt; on September 1. Miami defeated &lt;a href=\"Florida%20A%26amp%3BM%20Rattlers%20football\"&gt;Florida A&amp;M&lt;/a&gt; 41-7 and &lt;a href=\"Arkansas%20State%20Red%20Wolves%20football\"&gt;Arkansas State&lt;/a&gt; 41-20 over the next two weeks before losing to No. 24 &lt;a href=\"Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 41\u201331. On September 27, the Hurricanes defeated &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of 22\u201310. On October 4, &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt; defeated Miami by a score of 28\u201317. Miami won their next three; winning 55\u201334 over &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20football\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, 30\u20136 over &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt; and 47\u201320 over &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Golden's squad struggled to finish the season, losing their last four; a 30-26 letdown to archrival &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt;, a 30-13 disappointment to &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, a 35\u201323 defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; in the regular season finale and a 24-21 close defeat in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Independence%20Bowl\"&gt;2014 Independence Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shreveport%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Shreveport, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina%20Gamecocks%20football\"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hurricanes finished 8\u20135 in &lt;a href=\"2015%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;. By this time, many Miami fans had grown restless and irritated at the team's inconsistencies and began to call for Golden to be fired using different means, including flying airplanes over &lt;a href=\"Hard%20Rock%20Stadium\"&gt;Hard Rock Stadium&lt;/a&gt; with various \"Fire Al Golden\" banners. The Hurricanes started the season with a 45\u20130 shutout of &lt;a href=\"Bethune-Cookman%20Wildcats%20football\"&gt;Bethune-Cookman&lt;/a&gt; on September 5. A 44\u201320 win over &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Atlantic%20Owls%20football\"&gt;Florida Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and a 36\u201333 overtime victory over &lt;a href=\"Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; followed before the Hurricanes lost 34\u201323 to &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20football\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; and 29\u201324 to No. 12 &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt;. Miami defeated &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 30\u201320 on October 17 in what would be Al Golden's last win as Miami head coach. On October 25, 2015, the day after a 58\u20130 home loss to &lt;a href=\"Clemson%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Clemson&lt;/a&gt;, the worst defeat in school history, the university's athletic director, &lt;a href=\"Blake%20James%20%28athletics%20director%29\"&gt;Blake James&lt;/a&gt;, announced Golden had been fired. Golden was 32\u201325 in his five seasons at Miami and led the program to bowl games in 2013 and 2014. &lt;a href=\"Tight%20end\"&gt;Tight end&lt;/a&gt;s coach &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Scott%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Larry Scott&lt;/a&gt; finished the season as interim head coach. In Scott's first game as interim head coach, the Hurricanes recorded a controversial win over &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt;. The Hurricanes used eight &lt;a href=\"lateral%20pass\"&gt;laterals&lt;/a&gt; (reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Play%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;1982 Cal-Stanford ending&lt;/a&gt;) on a kickoff return with no time remaining to score the game-winning touchdown and stun the Blue Devils by a score of 30\u201327. However, video evidence showed the play should have been blown dead and not counted as a touchdown, as Miami players who possessed the ball on that play's knee were shown to be on the ground more than once. Although the outcome of the game couldn't be changed, the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; subsequently suspended the game and replay officials for failing to catch the errors and make the correct call. On November 7, Miami defeated &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 27\u201321. The next week, the Hurricanes lost to No. 17 &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 59\u201321. Miami then defeated &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt; 38-21 and &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; 29\u201324. The Hurricanes received a berth in the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Sun%20Bowl\"&gt;2015 Sun Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, a game they lost to &lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20Cougars%20football\"&gt;Washington State&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 20\u201314.\nMark Richt era (2016\u20132018).\nOn December 4, 2015, former &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Bulldogs%20football\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Richt\"&gt;Mark Richt&lt;/a&gt; was named Miami's 24th head football coach. The hiring generated much excitement and was well-received and praised all across the country. Although he had recently been fired as head coach of the Bulldogs, Richt achieved great successes during his 15 years as Georgia head coach. His teams represented the SEC in three BCS bowl appearances with a record of 2\u20131, and finished in the top ten of the final AP Poll seven times (2002\u20132005, 2007, 2012, 2014). His 2008 team also finished in the top ten of the coaches poll. His Georgia teams averaged about nine wins per season, won two &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Conference\"&gt;Southeastern Conference&lt;/a&gt; championship games and reached four more, reached bowl games each of his 15 seasons as head coach and sent many players to &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; playing careers. Richt had prior ties to the Miami football program, having played &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt; for the Hurricanes under &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Saban\"&gt;Lou Saban&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Schnellenberger\"&gt;Howard Schnellenberger&lt;/a&gt; from 1978 to 1982 and, despite being behind the likes of &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Kelly\"&gt;Jim Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vinny%20Testaverde\"&gt;Vinny Testaverde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Kosar\"&gt;Bernie Kosar&lt;/a&gt; on the depth chart, amassed nearly 1,500 passing yards during his college playing career. Richt also served as offensive coordinator at &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; from 1994 to 2000 under &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Bowden\"&gt;Bobby Bowden&lt;/a&gt;, overseeing an offense that was one of the most potent in the country, won two national championships, and produced two &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt; winners in &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Ward\"&gt;Charlie Ward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Weinke\"&gt;Chris Weinke&lt;/a&gt;. Miami signed Richt to a five-year contract worth $4.1 million annually.\nThe Hurricanes improved to 9\u20134 in &lt;a href=\"2016%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. They began the season on September 3 by blowing out in-state &lt;a href=\"Football%20Championship%20Subdivision\"&gt;FCS&lt;/a&gt; opponent &lt;a href=\"Florida%20A%26amp%3BM%20Rattlers%20football\"&gt;Florida A&amp;M&lt;/a&gt; 70\u20133. The next week, the Hurricanes defeated &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Atlantic%20Owls%20football\"&gt;Florida Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 38\u201310. After defeating &lt;a href=\"Appalachian%20State%20Mountaineers%20football\"&gt;Appalachian State&lt;/a&gt; 45\u201310, Miami defeated &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 35\u201321 to record their first &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; win under Richt. Then, the Hurricanes embarked upon a four-game losing streak, dropping games to No. 23 &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 20\u201319, &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of 20\u201313, &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt; by a count of 37-16 and &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; to the tune of 30\u201327. The Hurricanes rebounded to win their last five games of the season; a 51-28 trouncing of &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, a 34\u201314 victory over &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, a 27\u201313 win over &lt;a href=\"NC%20State%20Wolfpack%20football\"&gt;NC State&lt;/a&gt; and a 40\u201321 win over &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; with quarterback &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Kaaya\"&gt;Brad Kaaya&lt;/a&gt; becoming Miami's all-time leading passer to close the regular season. On December 28, 2016, Richt led the Hurricanes to their first bowl win in 10 years, when they defeated No. 16 &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Russell%20Athletic%20Bowl\"&gt;2016 Russell Athletic Bowl&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 31\u201314.\nMiami finished 10\u20133 in &lt;a href=\"2017%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;. The Hurricanes began the season on September 2, defeating in-state &lt;a href=\"Football%20Championship%20Subdivision\"&gt;FCS&lt;/a&gt; opponent &lt;a href=\"Bethune%E2%80%93Cookman%20Wildcats%20football\"&gt;Bethune\u2013Cookman&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of 41\u201313. The Hurricanes were supposed to play &lt;a href=\"Arkansas%20State%20Red%20Wolves%20football\"&gt;Arkansas State&lt;/a&gt; on September 9, but the game was canceled due to &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Irma\"&gt;Hurricane Irma&lt;/a&gt; battering the state of &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; that weekend. Although the game was to be played in &lt;a href=\"Jonesboro%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Jonesboro, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Miami administration contended that it would be too difficult for the football team to safely travel in and out of Florida due to the intensity of the hurricane. When Miami refused to reschedule the game and pay the $650,000 they agreed to pay the Red Wolves, the Arkansas State University administration filed a lawsuit seeking the payment. As a result of the cancellation, Miami only played 11 regular season games in 2017 as opposed to the usual 12. Miami also rescheduled their game against &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; from September 16 to October 7 due to the aftermath of the hurricane. On September 23, Miami played its second game of the season, defeating &lt;a href=\"Toledo%20Rockets%20football\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 52\u201330. After a 31\u20136 victory over &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt;, Richt's team defeated archrival &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 24\u201320. After a 25-24 nail biting win over &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt;, the Hurricanes defeated &lt;a href=\"Syracuse%20Orange%20football\"&gt;Syracuse&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of 27\u201319. On October 28, Miami defeated &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 24\u201319. That was followed by a 28\u201310 victory over No. 13 &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;. On November 11, Richt's squad obliterated &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 41\u20138. After a 44\u201328 win over &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, Miami suffered its first loss of the season in the regular season finale, falling to &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of 24\u201314. In the &lt;a href=\"2017%20ACC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;2017 ACC Championship Game&lt;/a&gt;, Miami was obliterated by No. 1 &lt;a href=\"Clemson%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Clemson&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 38\u20133. The Hurricanes accepted a berth in the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;2017 Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, a game they lost to No. 6 &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20Badgers%20football\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 34\u201324. On May 3, 2018, the University of Miami administration signed Richt to a five-year contract extension. Miami ended 2018 with another loss to Wisconsin, this time in the Pinstripe Bowl 35\u20133, finishing 7\u20136. On December 30, 2018, Richt abruptly announced his retirement from coaching.\nManny Diaz era (2019\u20132021).\nOn the same day Richt announced his retirement, Miami hired &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Diaz%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Manny Diaz&lt;/a&gt; as their new head coach. Diaz, a Miami native, had served as the team's defensive coordinator the past 3 seasons and was hired as head coach by &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Owls%20football\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; 17 days prior to Richt's retirement.\nDiaz compiled a 21\u201315 record in three seasons at the university. On December 6, 2021, in anticipation of hiring &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Ducks%20football\"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; head coach and Canes alumnus &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Cristobal\"&gt;Mario Cristobal&lt;/a&gt; to replace him, Diaz was fired.\nMario Cristobal era (2021\u2013present).\nOn December 7, 2021, Mario Cristobal was officially introduced as Hurricanes coach.\nChampionships.\nNational championships.\nMiami has won 9 &lt;a href=\"College%20football%20national%20championships%20in%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS\"&gt;national championships&lt;/a&gt; from NCAA-designated major selectors. Miami claims the 1983, 1987, 1989, 1991, and 2001 national championships.\nClaimed national championship\nConference championships.\nMiami has won nine conference championships, six outright and three shared.\n\u2020 Co-champions\nDivision championships.\nMiami has one division championship in the ACC Coastal Division.\nBowl games.\nMiami has played in 43 bowl games, going 19\u201324. Its most common bowl destination has been the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Bowl%20%28game%29\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, where the 'Canes have appeared 9 times and compiled a 6\u20133 record. Miami's most common opponent in bowl play has been &lt;a href=\"Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;. The schools have met six times in bowl play, with the Hurricanes having a 4\u20132 record against the Cornhuskers.\nRivalries.\nFlorida Cup.\nMiami's traditional rivals are &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Gators%20football\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2002, the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Cup\"&gt;Florida Cup&lt;/a&gt; has been awarded to the team that finishes with the best head-to-head record in years where Miami, Florida, and Florida State all face each other. Five Florida Cups have been awarded, with Miami winning the first three.\nFlorida State.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; rivalry dates to 1951, when the Hurricanes defeated the Seminoles 35\u201313 in their inaugural meeting. The schools have played every year since 1966, with Miami holding the all-time advantage, 33\u201330. Upon the conclusion of their 2003 regular-season schedules, the teams represented their respective conferences in the 2004 &lt;a href=\"FedEx%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;FedEx Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt; (Miami being the champions of the Big East, and Florida State being the champions of the ACC). Miami won the bowl game 16\u201314; it was the only time the schools have met in post-season football play. The 63 meetings between the teams of FSU and Miami eclipsed the rivalry between the Hurricanes and the Gators (from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Florida\"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt;) following their 2010 game; the series of games between UM and Florida is Miami's second-longest at 55 games.\nDuring the 1980s and '90s, the series emerged as one of the premier rivalries in college football. Between 1983 and 2002, the Hurricanes and Seminoles combined to win 7 national championships and play in 14 bowl games with a national championship at stake. The 1988 game starred 57 future &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; pros on the combined rosters. Since 2004, the year Miami left the &lt;a href=\"Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29\"&gt;Big East Conference&lt;/a&gt; to join the expanded 12-member &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt;, the universities have been conference foes, though they are placed in separate divisions within the conference. This alignment creates the potential for the two teams to meet for a second time in the &lt;a href=\"ACC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;ACC Championship Game&lt;/a&gt;, should each win their respective divisions in any particular season. Such a rematch has yet to happen after 14 years of ACC Championship Games, as of 2018.\nThe series has consistently drawn very high &lt;a href=\"Nielsen%20ratings\"&gt;television ratings&lt;/a&gt; with the 2006 Miami\u2013Florida State game being the most-watched college football game\u2014regular-season or postseason\u2014in &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; history, and the 2009 and 1994 meetings being the second- and fifth-most watched regular season games, respectively.\nThe Miami Hurricanes lead the all-time series 33\u201330. The most recent meeting was in 2018 on October 6 when the Miami Hurricanes won 28\u201327.\nFlorida.\nMiami's rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Gators%20football\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; dates back to 1938, making it the oldest rivalry among Florida's \"Big Three\" of Miami, Florida, and Florida State. The Hurricanes defeated the Gators, 19\u20137, in the first meeting between the geographic rivals. The Seminole War Canoe was carved in 1955 out of a cypress struck by lightning and was given to the winner of the annual football game. The canoe is meant to symbolize the fighting spirit of the Seminole people that is often on display during games between the Hurricanes and Gators. The canoe is now on permanent display at the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame on the Coral Gables campus.\nMiami holds the edge in the all-time series with a 29\u201326 record against Florida. The two schools met every year from 1944 until 1987, but have not played regularly since then. Florida canceled the annual series after the 1987 season, when the requirement of the &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Conference\"&gt;Southeastern Conference&lt;/a&gt; for member schools to play eight conference games induced the University of Florida to fill out the non-conference portion of its schedule with teams that do not require a home-and-home arrangement, except for Florida State.\nFrom 1986 to 2003, Miami won all six of the games between the schools, including victories in the 2001 &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt; and the 2004 &lt;a href=\"Peach%20Bowl\"&gt;Peach Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Florida snapped its 23-year drought against Miami with a 26\u20133 win over the Hurricanes in 2008. In 2019, the series resumed with Florida winning 24\u201320 in the &lt;a href=\"Camping%20World%20Kickoff\"&gt;Camping World Kickoff&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando, Florida.\nVirginia Tech.\nThe Hurricanes and Hokies first met on November 13, 1953, in Miami. The two teams have played annually since 1992, and the rivalry developed when the Hokies became a member of the Big East Conference for football in 1991. When the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) expanded in 2004, both Miami and Virginia Tech became members of the ACC. Both teams continue to compete annually as part of the ACC's Coastal Division. Miami and Virginia Tech have twice met in bowl games, the &lt;a href=\"1966%20Liberty%20Bowl\"&gt;1966 Liberty Bowl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1981%20Peach%20Bowl%20%28January%29\"&gt;1981 Peach Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Miami leads the series 22\u201315 through the 2019 season.\nNebraska.\nThe series with &lt;a href=\"Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; is tied at 6\u20136 as of 2018.\nFacilities.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hard%20Rock%20Stadium\"&gt;Hard Rock Stadium&lt;/a&gt; plays host to the Hurricanes football team during their regular season. The stadium is located in &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Gardens%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Miami Gardens, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, located approximately north of the UM's main &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Gables%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Coral Gables&lt;/a&gt; campus. Hard Rock stadium is the home stadium of the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Dolphins\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;(NFL).\nFrom 1937 through 2007, the team played its home games at the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=\"Miami\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;. In the late 2000s, the City of Miami, the owner of the Orange Bowl, proposed to extensively renovate it. However, those plans fell by the wayside as the city focused on keeping the Marlins baseball team in town, forcing the university to threaten a move to Hard Rock Stadium if a plan to renovate the stadium was not in place within 45 days. When the city could not deliver on a renovation plan, the university's board of trustees, on the recommendation of UM President &lt;a href=\"Donna%20Shalala\"&gt;Donna Shalala&lt;/a&gt;, approved the shift to Hard Rock Stadium on August 21, 2007.\nAt its inception, the program played at Tamiami Park and, later, Moore Park before moving to the then &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Burdine Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in 1937.\nThe team practices on-campus at the Greentree Practice Fields, which were named the College Football Field of the Year by the SportsTurf Managers Association in 2007. The Hecht Athletic Center, also located on-campus, serves as the program's training facility and is home to the football offices. In November 2010, the university announced a gift of five million dollars from the Ted and Todd Schwartz family foundation that would be used to build the Schwartz Center for Athletic Excellence. The facility caters to over 400 student athletes on the campus with a sports medicine facility, training room, and academic center. The facility also has features specifically designed for the football team:\nIn May 2017, the university broke ground on the new Carol Soffer Indoor Practice Facility. The $34 million facility was led by a $14 million gift from Miami billionaire Jeffrey Soffer, owner of the famed &lt;a href=\"Fontainebleau%20Miami%20Beach\"&gt;Fountainebleau Miami Beach&lt;/a&gt;. The building exceeds 100,000 square feet and includes two turf fields that combine for 81,000-square feet. The indoor facility, located on the current football practice area, will also house a football operations center with a mezzanine level for the football coaches' offices and meeting rooms.\nRecords.\nWinning streaks.\nMiami also has two of the &lt;a href=\"Longest%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20football%20winning%20streaks\"&gt;longest winning streaks in NCAA Division I history&lt;/a&gt;. From 2000 to 2003, Miami won 34 consecutive games, tying for sixth all-time. The streak started on September 23, 2000, with a 47\u201310 victory at &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and ended on January 3, 2003, with a 31\u201324 double overtime loss to &lt;a href=\"2002%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football%20team\"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Fiesta%20Bowl\"&gt;2003 Fiesta Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Miami also won 29 straight games from October 27, 1990, to January 1, 1993, good for 13th on the all-time list. That streak was snapped when the top-ranked Hurricanes were upset by second-ranked &lt;a href=\"1993%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, 34\u201313 in the &lt;a href=\"1993%20Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;1993 Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiami owns the record for the longest home winning streak in NCAA history, winning 58 straight games at the Orange Bowl. The record streak began with a 38\u20130 shutout victory over Cincinnati on October 12, 1985, and ended with a 38\u201320 loss to Washington on September 24, 1994. The 58 game streak includes three Orange Bowl victories where Miami was the away team because of the Orange Bowl's tie to the Big 8 conference.\nIn addition to its own lengthy winning streaks, Miami has snapped four streaks of 20 games or more in its history. The only other school to snap four winning streaks of 20 or more games is &lt;a href=\"Princeton%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Princeton&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"1984%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;1984 Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, Miami ended top-ranked &lt;a href=\"Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;'s 22-game winning streak and won its first national championship with a 31\u201330 victory. The Hurricanes halted top-ranked &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;'s 20-game streak and won their second national championship when they defeated the Sooners, 20\u201314, in the &lt;a href=\"1988%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;1988 Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. The Hurricanes ended top-ranked &lt;a href=\"1989%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football%20team\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;'s 23-game winning streak with a 27\u201310 win on November 25, 1989. Miami also ended the 20-game winning streak of &lt;a href=\"UCLA%20Bruins%20football\"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; when Miami defeated the third-ranked Bruins 49\u201345 on December 5, 1998.\nWins versus AP Number 1.\nMiami has 9 wins against AP Number 1 ranked teams, which is tied with Alabama for the most all-time in college football. Overall, Miami is 9\u20139 against AP Number 1 teams, with the most recent win against Florida State in 2000. Rankings below are all from the Associated Press (AP), and games listed are when Miami's opponent was the Number 1 team.\nNotable players and coaches.\nFor a more comprehensive list see &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20University%20of%20Miami%20alumni%23National%20Football%20League\"&gt;List of University of Miami alumni#National Football League&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20in%20the%20NFL%20draft\"&gt;List of Miami Hurricanes in the NFL draft&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollege Football Hall of Fame inductees.\nThe following 11 Miami players and coaches have been inducted to the &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;College Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nPro Football Hall of Fame inductees.\nNine former players have been inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Professional%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Professional Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraditions.\nTouchdown Tommy.\nTouchdown Tommy is the cannon that is fired off when the team runs out of the tunnel, after every point that the Hurricanes score, and the conclusion of a victory. The cannon is kept by the &lt;a href=\"Sigma%20Chi\"&gt;Sigma Chi&lt;/a&gt; fraternity's Cannon Master and fired off during the games by the senior brothers of Sigma Chi. Touchdown Tommy is the third oldest tradition at the University of Miami, after the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Arrow%20Honor%20Society\"&gt;Iron Arrow Honor Society&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20the%20Ibis\"&gt;Sebastian the Ibis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Smoke.\nOne of the Hurricanes best-known traditions is the team's entrance scene. The team enters the field through a large cloud of white smoke billowing from its entrance tunnel, amid a tape of a hurricane blasting over the sound system. The smoke comes from fire extinguisher exhaust that billows from a series of pipes welded together by school transportation director Bob Nalette in the 1950s. The pipes were moved to Sun Life Stadium when the Hurricanes moved there in 2008.\nFollowing Miami's rise to prominence in the 1980s, many high school, college and &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; teams over the last 25 years have copied this practice, and in 2001 &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; made a parody of it for a Saturday college football commercial.\nRing of Honor.\nIn 1997, the university established the 'Ring of Honor' as a way to honor outstanding players who have passed through the Hurricane football program. Members are selected by an anonymous advisory committee, the director of athletics and the head football coach. The names and jersey numbers of the inductees were displayed on the upper deck of the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt; (which has since been torn down). The inaugural class of included &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Dooley\"&gt;Jim Dooley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Hendricks\"&gt;Ted Hendricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Mira\"&gt;George Mira&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vinny%20Testaverde\"&gt;Vinny Testaverde&lt;/a&gt;. These four players are the only ones in the history of the program to have their numbers retired by the university as well. Vinny Testaverde's number was taken out of retirement for the 2015\u20132016 football season, at Testaverde's behest. His son wears No. 14.\nA second group of players consisting of &lt;a href=\"Ottis%20Anderson\"&gt;Ottis Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Don%20Bosseler\"&gt;Don Bosseler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Kosar\"&gt;Bernie Kosar&lt;/a&gt;, and Burgess Owens was inducted in 1999. After a nine-year hiatus, five new players were added in 2008: &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Pro Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;rs &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Kelly\"&gt;Jim Kelly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Otto\"&gt;Jim Otto&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt;-winner &lt;a href=\"Gino%20Torretta\"&gt;Gino Torretta&lt;/a&gt;, running back &lt;a href=\"Edgerrin%20James\"&gt;Edgerrin James&lt;/a&gt;, and defensive lineman &lt;a href=\"Cortez%20Kennedy\"&gt;Cortez Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2009, &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;College Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; defensive back &lt;a href=\"Bennie%20Blades\"&gt;Bennie Blades&lt;/a&gt;, running back and former Miami head coach &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Dunn%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Eddie Dunn&lt;/a&gt;, and quarterback &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Walsh%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Steve Walsh&lt;/a&gt; were inducted.\nTurnover Chain.\nIn 2017, the Miami Hurricanes began to award its \"Turnover Chain,\" an honor that contains a 36-inch, 2.5-kilogram, 10-karat gold chain, with 900 orange and green sapphire stones arranged in a \"U\" that is 6.5 inches wide. It is presented during a game to any defensive player who forces a turnover.\nThrough the 11 regular-season games Miami played in 2017, the Hurricanes' defense created 29 turnovers (17 passes intercepted, 12 fumbles recovered), the third most in FBS football. During the same period, Miami gave up 12 turnovers (throwing 9 interceptions, and losing 3 fumbles); the net gain of 17 turnovers resulted in a margin of +1.55 per game. That figure represents the greatest margin in the nation this year, an achievement shared with &lt;a href=\"2017%20UCF%20Knights%20football%20team\"&gt;Central Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiami Hurricanes in the NFL.\nMany Miami players go on to play in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;. The school holds multiple NFL draft related records: most first-round draft picks in a two-year period (11, 2003\u20132004); most first-round draft picks in a three-year period (15, 2002\u20132004); and most first-round picks in a four-year period (19, 2001\u20132004). From 1995 through 2008, Miami set an &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Draft\"&gt;NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; record by having at least one player selected in the first round of 14 consecutive drafts. The Hurricanes once had a streak of 149 consecutive regular season weeks where a former Hurricane scored a touchdown in an NFL game; the streak started in Week 15 of the 2002 NFL regular season and ended in Week 11 of the 2011 season. During the streak, 33 different former Hurricanes scored touchdowns and a total of 661 touchdowns were scored. Setting a new record for most players from one school, eleven former Hurricanes were selected to the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;2010 Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, which happened to take place at Miami's &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Life%20Stadium\"&gt;Sun Life Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf the program's last six head coaches, three have gone directly on to head coaching positions in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;:\nHoward Schnellenberger resigned as the Hurricanes head coach in order to become part owner and coach of Miami's first &lt;a href=\"USFL\"&gt;USFL&lt;/a&gt; franchise to be named \"The Spirit of Miami.\" It did not materialize, and he took the head coaching position at the &lt;a href=\"Louisville%20Cardinals%20football\"&gt;University of Louisville&lt;/a&gt;. (Schnellenberger would eventually end his coaching career at another South Florida school, &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Atlantic%20Owls%20football\"&gt;Florida Atlantic University&lt;/a&gt;.)\nControversies and scandals.\nThe &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Miami\"&gt;University of Miami&lt;/a&gt; has also experienced some degree of controversies, scandals and incidents which at times have led to &lt;a href=\"NCAA\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; sanctions, suspensions, and negative publicity for the university. These include a situation in 1978 where three players threw a man into a lake precipitating the resignation of coach &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Saban\"&gt;Lou Saban&lt;/a&gt;, the 1991 Cotton Bowl Classic unsportsmanlike conduct giving rise to the so-called \"Miami Rule\", the 1995 Pell Grant scandal, and the 2005 \"7th Floor Crew\" rap song, described above.\n1980s: Luther Campbell's \"pay for play\".\n&lt;a href=\"2%20Live%20Crew\"&gt;2 Live Crew&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Luther%20Campbell\"&gt;Luther Campbell&lt;/a&gt; was alleged to have been behind what was referred to as a \"pay-for-play\" system, which involved cash rewards for acts such as scoring touchdowns and big hits, although Campbell has never donated directly to the University of Miami or its athletics department.\n2006: FIU brawl.\nOn October 14, 2006, in the first meeting of cross-town programs, Miami and the &lt;a href=\"FIU%20Panthers%20football\"&gt;Florida International Golden Panthers&lt;/a&gt; brawled after a &lt;a href=\"Extra%20point\"&gt;PAT&lt;/a&gt;.\nFIU cornerback Chris Smith wrestled Miami holder Matt Perelli to the ground after the kick and appeared to punch him in the chin. Another FIU cornerback, Marshall McDuffie, Jr., kicked Perelli in the head. Miami's &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Reddick\"&gt;Anthony Reddick&lt;/a&gt; swung his helmet at FIU players and Miami's &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Meriweather\"&gt;Brandon Meriweather&lt;/a&gt; kicked an FIU player. FIU's A'Mod Ned, who was injured, came onto the field and swung at Miami players with his crutches. The fight lasted just over one minute before the coaches of both teams were able to separate the players. Florida Highway Patrol state troopers and City of Miami police arrived on the field as the fight was going on and remained a visual presence on the sidelines and in the stands to prevent further fighting. The game was delayed approximately 15 to 20 minutes as the officials attempted to sort out which players were ejected and what, if any, penalty yards needed to be enforced.\nThe next day, 31 players from both schools were punished\u201318 from FIU, 13 from Miami; the Miami players were handed one-game suspensions, while the FIU players were suspended for the remainder of the season. Three Miami players were suspended indefinitely and the rest were also assigned community service work.\n2002\u20132010: Shapiro scandal.\nA &lt;a href=\"Ponzi%20scheme\"&gt;Ponzi scheme&lt;/a&gt;r, convicted &lt;a href=\"felony\"&gt;felon&lt;/a&gt; and former Miami booster, &lt;a href=\"Nevin%20Shapiro\"&gt;Nevin Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;, claimed he used investor funds to finance donations to the University of Miami's athletic program and gave an estimated $2 million in illegal benefits to at least 72 current or former football and basketball players and coaches from 2002 to 2010. A &lt;a href=\"Yahoo%21%20Sports\"&gt;Yahoo! Sports&lt;/a&gt; report alleged that Shapiro, through his donations, violated at least four major NCAA bylaws.\nDuring the investigation of the allegations, the university self-imposed a ban on bowl participation. In October 2013, the NCAA announced that the university would lose three football scholarships in each of the next three seasons, but there would be no further bowl ban. The university became eligible again for bowl participation as of the 2013\u201314 season.\nDocumentary film.\nIn 2009, Miami-based media studio &lt;a href=\"Rakontur\"&gt;Rakontur&lt;/a&gt; released a documentary film called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20U%20%28documentary%29\"&gt;The U&lt;/a&gt;\", as part of &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;'s \"30 for 30\" film series. The film depicts the rise of the University of Miami's football tradition throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. According to the filmmaker, the university chose not to be involved in the project, and denied access to coach Randy Shannon, Paul Dee and &lt;a href=\"Edward%20T.%20Foote%20II\"&gt;Tad Foote&lt;/a&gt;, the former president of the university. The film features the rise of the UM football program in the 1980s, but also includes details related to player crime and drug usage and privileges provided to players, including &lt;a href=\"Luther%20Campbell\"&gt;Luther Campbell&lt;/a&gt;'s \"pay for play\", in which the rap star reportedly paid UM players for major hits and plays. The film addresses the controversial and pioneering nature of the UM football program. The film was pre-screened on campus on December 10, 2009, with only two student athletes attending and televised two days later on &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;. \"The U Part 2\" was also created to depict the rise and once again fall of their football program.\nFuture non-conference opponents.\nAnnounced schedules as of December 3, 2019.\nThe ACC plays an eight-game conference schedule, with four non-conference games to schedule a year. This is Miami's future scheduled non-conference opponents, subject to change."
