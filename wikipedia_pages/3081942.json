Eventually, the New Zealand government decided that &lt;a href=\"Eden%20Park\"&gt;Eden Park&lt;/a&gt; would host the final, with North Harbour as the official reserve option.\nThe stadium's media facilities were updated for matches that were hosted at the venue. A large broadcast town was developed on the western side of the ground. It comprises three levels for venue operations and ground announcer on the first floor, television and radio commentators and television match official on the second with an retraceable window on the third floor for cameras.\nReferences.\nhttps://archello.com/project/north-harbour-stadium-broadcast-tower"
