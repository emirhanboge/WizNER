    "text": "John Hardy Goetz (October 24, 1937 \u2013 October 27, 2008) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; player. Despite being left handed, he was a right-handed &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared in four &lt;a href=\"games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;, but had an 11-year career in &lt;a href=\"minor%20league%20baseball\"&gt;minor league baseball&lt;/a&gt;. A native of &lt;a href=\"Goetzville%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Goetzville, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, he stood tall, weighed and attended &lt;a href=\"Western%20Michigan%20University\"&gt;Western Michigan University&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoetz' Major League trial came at the outset of the &lt;a href=\"1960%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season\"&gt;1960&lt;/a&gt; Cubs' season. He made the team's 28-man early-season roster out of &lt;a href=\"spring%20training\"&gt;spring training&lt;/a&gt; and appeared as a &lt;a href=\"relief%20pitcher\"&gt;relief pitcher&lt;/a&gt; in four contests. In his MLB debut, against the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt;, he was effective, hurling 2\u2154 &lt;a href=\"inning%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;innings&lt;/a&gt; of scoreless relief. But he was treated roughly in outings against the Giants the following week and against the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; in his last appearance, and was returned to the minors, where he spent the rest of his career. He retired from professional baseball after the 1965 season and 333 games played in the minors.\nIn 6\u2153 Major League innings, Goetz allowed nine &lt;a href=\"earned%20runs\"&gt;earned runs&lt;/a&gt;, ten &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;struck out&lt;/a&gt; six."
