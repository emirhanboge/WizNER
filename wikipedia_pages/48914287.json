As an example, Mottawai Abdel-Baki, who has long experience in athletics, had to switch to sitting volleyball after his category in athletics was cancelled so we lost hope for a medal.\u201d\nEgypt's &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Youth%20and%20Sports%20%28Egypt%29\"&gt;Minister of Youth and Sports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khaled%20Abdel-Aziz\"&gt;Khaled Abdel-Aziz&lt;/a&gt; told his country's Paralympians ahead of the Games, \u201cWe are trying our best to give you an equal chance and I am sure you will collect more medals and that is why the ministry is delaying the celebration of the Olympians until you are back with the medals.\"\nMedalists.\nEgypt finished the 2016 Games ranked second all time for total medals won by African countries, with 143 total medals, 45 gold, 43 silver and 55 bronze.

In the by discipline sections below, medalists' names are bolded.\nDisability classifications.\nEvery participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Paralympic%20Games%23Disability%20categories\"&gt;disability categories&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"amputation\"&gt;amputation&lt;/a&gt;, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; &lt;a href=\"cerebral%20palsy\"&gt;cerebral palsy&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"wheelchair\"&gt;wheelchair&lt;/a&gt; athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; &lt;a href=\"visual%20impairment\"&gt;visual impairment&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"blindness\"&gt;blindness&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Les%20Autres%20sport%20classification\"&gt;Les autres&lt;/a&gt;, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example &lt;a href=\"dwarfism\"&gt;dwarfism&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"multiple%20sclerosis\"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;. Each &lt;a href=\"Paralympic%20Games%23Summer%20sports\"&gt;Paralympic sport&lt;/a&gt; then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example &lt;a href=\"Swimming%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.\nAthletics.\nSix Egyptians competed in track and field at the 2016 Games.\nPowerlifting.\nEgypt secured 17 quotas for Rio 2016. They were led to Rio by four time Paralympic gold medalist &lt;a href=\"Fatma%20Omar\"&gt;Fatma Omar&lt;/a&gt;. The team also included &lt;a href=\"Sherif%20Othman\"&gt;Sherif Othman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Metwalli%20Mathana\"&gt;Metwalli Mathana&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Metwalli%20Mathana\"&gt;Metwalli Mathana&lt;/a&gt; appeared in his sixth Paralympic Games.\nHistorically, Egyptian powerlifters have faced a number of barriers despite their obvious success at the Paralympic Games. They have lacked financial support. Because of the low numbers of practitioners, there is a lack of awareness among parents of children with disabilities about the potential to get involved with powerlifting. These low numbers of practitioners also make the sport cost more, which further reduces participation numbers. The materials provided by the Egyptian Paralympic Committee, and for Disabled Sport Powerlifting Federation are also sometimes wanting in quality, and the cost of distributing them means they are sometimes hard to come by. It is also hard for Egyptians to go abroad, and to bring foreign lifers to Egypt to assist Egyptians in training.\nSitting volleyball.\n&lt;a href=\"Egypt%20men%27s%20national%20sitting%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Egypt men's national sitting volleyball team&lt;/a&gt; qualified for the 2016 Games at the African Championships.\nSwimming.\n&lt;a href=\"Ayattalah%20Ayman\"&gt;Ayattalah Ayman&lt;/a&gt; was Egypt's first female swimmer to compete at the Paralympic Games.\nTable tennis.\nEgypt sent a five player strong delegation to Rio. The team included &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20Hamadtou\"&gt;Ibrahim Al Husseini Hamadtou&lt;/a&gt;, the only table tennis player to compete while holding the paddle in his mouth. He went to the Rio Games when he was a 41-year-old. &lt;a href=\"ElSaied%20Ragab\"&gt;ElSaied Ragab&lt;/a&gt; was selected as an umpire for the Paralympic Games in table tennis."
