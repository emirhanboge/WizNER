The club are currently members of the and play at Merland Rise. They are affiliated to the &lt;a href=\"Surrey%20County%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Surrey County Football Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe club was established in 1944 as Banstead Juniors, before adopting their current name during the 1946\u201347 season. After winning the Surrey Intermediate Cup that season, the club won back-to-back league titles before moving up to the &lt;a href=\"Surrey%20Senior%20League\"&gt;Surrey Senior League&lt;/a&gt; in 1949. They finished as runners-up in their first season, and went on to win the league four times in a row between 1950\u201351 and 1953\u201354, with Harry Clark scoring 81 goals in 26 games in 1950\u201351. The next two seasons saw them finish as runners-up to &lt;a href=\"Dorking%20F.C.\"&gt;Dorking&lt;/a&gt;, before they won their fifth title in 1956\u201357. Although they finished as runners-up again for the next two seasons, the club went into decline at the start of the 1960s, and finished second-from-bottom in 1961\u201362.\nThe 1964\u201365 season saw Banstead win their sixth Surrey Senior League title, claiming the championship on goal average from &lt;a href=\"Chobham%20F.C.\"&gt;Chobham&lt;/a&gt;, and they moved up to the &lt;a href=\"Spartan%20League\"&gt;Spartan League&lt;/a&gt;. When the league merged with the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%E2%80%93London%20League\"&gt;Metropolitan\u2013London League&lt;/a&gt; in 1975, forming the London Spartan League, Banstead were placed in Division One.\nIn 1979 the club switched to the &lt;a href=\"Athenian%20League\"&gt;Athenian League&lt;/a&gt;, where they remained until it disbanded in 1984, winning the League Cup in 1980\u201381. When the league folded most clubs (including Banstead) joining the &lt;a href=\"Isthmian%20League\"&gt;Isthmian League&lt;/a&gt;, with Banstead placed in Division Two South. The league was reorganised in 1991, with the club placed in Division Two. They remained in the division until 2002 when further league reorganisation saw them moved to Division One South. Two years later another reorganisation saw them placed in Division One.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;2005\u201306 season&lt;/a&gt; Banstead resigned from the Isthmian League and dropped into the Combined Counties League Premier Division. After finishing bottom of the division in &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Combined%20Counties%20Football%20League\"&gt;2011\u201312&lt;/a&gt; they were relegated to Division One. They were Division One champions in &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Combined%20Counties%20Football%20League\"&gt;2016\u201317&lt;/a&gt;, earning promotion back to the Premier Division."
