    "text": "The Cathedral Church of Our Lady of Sorrows, also known as St Mary's Cathedral or Wrexham Cathedral, is a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wrexham\"&gt;Wrexham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. It is the &lt;a href=\"Chair%20%28official%29\"&gt;seat&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Wrexham\"&gt;Bishop of Wrexham&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"mother%20church\"&gt;mother church&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Wrexham\"&gt;Roman Catholic Diocese of Wrexham&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe cathedral was originally built as a &lt;a href=\"parish%20church\"&gt;parish church&lt;/a&gt; in 1857. Its architect, &lt;a href=\"E.%20W.%20Pugin\"&gt;Edward Welby Pugin&lt;/a&gt;, adopted a 14th-century &lt;a href=\"English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Decorated%20Gothic\"&gt;Decorated Gothic&lt;/a&gt; style. The church replaced an earlier chapel, located in King Street, which by the 1850s was deemed insufficient for the growing congregation, and finance was provided by a local industrialist. Further additions to satisfy a still-growing congregation were made in the mid-20th century, in the form of the cloister and side chapel.\nThe church was designated a &lt;a href=\"pro-cathedral\"&gt;pro-cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in 1898 upon the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;Roman Catholic Diocese of Menevia&lt;/a&gt;. It was consecrated on 7 November 1907.\nThe cathedral today.\nWrexham Cathedral is now a Grade II &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt;."
