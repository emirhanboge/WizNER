    "text": "Aaron Francis Broussard (born 6 January 1949 ) was the president, a combined municipal-parish position, of &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Jefferson Parish, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; from 2003 to 2010. A &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;, Broussard is known nationally for appearances he made in the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Katrina\"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife and career.\nBroussard was born in &lt;a href=\"Marksville%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Marksville&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of &lt;a href=\"Avoyelles%20Parish\"&gt;Avoyelles Parish&lt;/a&gt; in south central &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. He moved to &lt;a href=\"Kenner%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Kenner&lt;/a&gt;, a city in Jefferson Parish, in 1958. He received a &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; degree from &lt;a href=\"Loyola%20University%20New%20Orleans\"&gt;Loyola University New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; in 1973. The following year he was elected to the Jefferson Parish School Board and reelected in 1976. In 1977, he was elected as a district chairman to the Jefferson Parish Council and re-elected in 1981. He successfully ran for &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; of Kenner in 1982, and he was reelected in 1986, 1990, and 1994.\nBroussard was elected Chairman of the Jefferson Parish Council in 1995, and reelected in 1999.\nIn 2003, Broussard was elected Jefferson Parish president. He defeated &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; John M. McDonald by a huge margin, 72-28 percent, even though Jefferson Parish is considered a &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;GOP&lt;/a&gt; stronghold in Louisiana.\nBroussard was president of Parishes Against Coastal Erosion (PACE) and in a June 14, 2005, press release predicted:\nHurricane Katrina lawsuit.\nMany Jefferson Parish residents joined in a class action lawsuit against Broussard after he followed a years-old \"doomsday plan\" in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Katrina\"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; and evacuated more than 200 drainage pump operators north to &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Parish\"&gt;Washington Parish&lt;/a&gt;. The pumps remained off for more than two days and sections of the parish, including &lt;a href=\"Metairie\"&gt;Metairie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kenner%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Kenner&lt;/a&gt;, experienced severe flooding as a result of rain water, backflow from &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ponchartrain\"&gt;Lake Ponchartrain&lt;/a&gt; and flood waters from the broken &lt;a href=\"17th%20Street%20Canal\"&gt;17th Street Canal&lt;/a&gt;. Broussard defended his actions, saying that he wanted to protect the pump operators' lives, even though some pump operators were willing to stay. Other public officials, such as police and fire departments, did not evacuate. Water department workers also stayed.\nSeptember 4, 2005, \"Meet the Press\" appearance.\nThe most famous of Broussard's post Katrina interviews was one on the television program \"&lt;a href=\"Meet%20the%20Press\"&gt;Meet the Press&lt;/a&gt;\". In the course of that interview, he was critical of the disaster-response effort. He finished with a tearful account of the death by drowning of his emergency services manager's mother. Broussard's account of that incident was subsequently shown to be inaccurate, in that the long sequence of telephone calls to the mother that he described as having taken place in the aftermath of the hurricane could not have happened, since she apparently drowned before the dates in question.\nIn an appearance on Meet the Press three weeks later, Broussard was questioned about his account. He said that the story had been relayed to him by his staff, and that he had chosen not to ask his emergency manager for the exact circumstances of her death.\nBroussard and his employees were directly involved in the initial disaster-recovery efforts that followed &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Katrina\"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. On September 4, 2005 he was interviewed on &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Meet%20the%20Press\"&gt;Meet the Press&lt;/a&gt;, still inside his parish. Broussard called the response to Katrina \u201cOne of the Worst Abandonments of Americans on American Soil Ever\u201d and went on to say that FEMA had not only failed to meet his parish's need but actively withheld aid and cut his lines of communication:\nafter this, Broussard began to break out in tears.\nHe said:\nOther local politicians criticized the way the federal government handled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mayor\"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Nagin\"&gt;Ray Nagin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parish\"&gt;Parish&lt;/a&gt; Presidents &lt;a href=\"Junior%20Rodriguez\"&gt;Junior Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"St.%20Bernard%20Parish\"&gt;St. Bernard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benny%20Rousselle\"&gt;Benny Rousselle&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Plaquemines%20Parish\"&gt;Plaquemines&lt;/a&gt; are among the most notable ones.\nSubsequent reporting about the St. Rita's nursing home deaths.\nSubsequent news reports identified the son in the story as Tom Rodrigue, Jefferson Parish's emergency services director. Rodrigue's 92-year-old mother, Eva, lived in the St. Rita's nursing home. It appears from a CNN interview with Rodrigue that he made phone calls to the nursing home on Saturday, August 27, 2005, and on Sunday, August 28, 2005, and urged that the home be evacuated. That evacuation did not take place, and at least 30 residents of the nursing home drowned on Monday, August 29, 2005.\nA September 19, 2005, MSNBC story quotes Rodrigue as saying, in response to being told about Broussard's statements on Meet the Press, \"No, no, that's not true.\" A Broussard spokesperson described Broussard's statements about Rodrigue's mother on Meet the Press as \"a misunderstanding.\"\nSeptember 25, 2005, \"Meet the Press\" appearance.\nOn September 25, 2005, Broussard reappeared on \"Meet the Press\", and host Tim Russert challenged Broussard's account of the tragedy on the basis that his anecdote about the woman in the nursing home contained factual discrepancies noted in the MSNBC story. Broussard did not directly account for those discrepancies, repeating the statement that \"this gentleman's mother died on that Friday before I came on the show.\" In his subsequent remarks, though, he said that:\nBroussard has never acknowledged making an error in his original appearance though he did give this response:\nTo date, Broussard's comments with regard to the federal government have not been formally addressed. Broussard was also excluded from the formal investigation conducted into the response to Hurricane Katrina and thus was not called to explain his role in the $3\u00a0billion of flood damage to the East Bank of Jefferson Parish.\nRecall petition.\nOn December 6, 2005 the Jefferson Parish Action Committee filed a petition with the Louisiana Secretary of State to recall Broussard and remove him as President of Jefferson Parish.\nThe group cited numerous lapses in judgment by Broussard both pre and post Katrina, including the following:\nThe recall campaign obtained over 49,000 signatures, but this was fewer than the 93,000 signatures (1/3 of the registered voters in Jefferson parish) required under Louisiana law.\nRe-election campaign.\nBroussard won re-election narrowly with 52 percent of the vote over Leone. The East Bank of Jefferson went for Leone while Broussard carried the West Bank &lt;a href=\"http%3A//blog.nola.com/times-picayune/2007/10/jefferson_voting_followed_wate.html%23more\"&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt;\nAt the Alliance for Good Government forum Broussard refused to say he would stop taking money from Parish contractors. The alliance instead endorsed Leone but it was not enough to carry him to victory. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20071011124019/http%3A//www.nola.com/news/t-p/metro/index.ssf%3F%252Fbase%252Fnews-24%252F1190960356232900.xml%26amp%3Bcoll%3D1\"&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;\nResignation.\nBroussard resigned his position on January 8, 2010 in the face of a grand jury investigation of his staff.\nGuilty plea.\nOn September 24, 2012 Broussard pleaded guilty in federal court to two felony counts based on payroll fraud involving his ex-wife. On February 15, 2013, he was sentenced to 46 months in prison. He began serving his sentence in May 2013. Citing misconduct within the local U.S. Attorney's Office, Broussard filed a motion asking U.S. District Court Judge Hayden Head to vacate the conviction or\u2014alternately\u2014his sentence."
