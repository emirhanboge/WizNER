    "title": "Area code 574",
    "text": "Prior to 2002, the northern third of Indiana had been served by &lt;a href=\"area%20code%20219\"&gt;area code 219&lt;/a&gt; for 54 years. However, by the end of the 20th century, 219 was on the verge of exhaustion. It was decided to implement a three-way split of the 219 territory. As the result of a random drawing, the middle portion of the old 219 territory (South Bend) became 574. The eastern portion (&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Wayne\"&gt;Fort Wayne&lt;/a&gt;) became &lt;a href=\"area%20code%20260\"&gt;area code 260&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Indiana\"&gt;Northwest Indiana&lt;/a&gt; retained 219. The area codes split on January 15, 2002, with &lt;a href=\"permissive%20dialing\"&gt;permissive dialing&lt;/a&gt; continuing until June 14, 2002.\nPrior to October 2021, area code 574 had telephone numbers assigned for the &lt;a href=\"central%20office%20code\"&gt;central office code&lt;/a&gt; 988. In 2020, \"988\" was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Suicide%20Prevention%20Lifeline\"&gt;National Suicide Prevention Lifeline&lt;/a&gt;, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit &lt;a href=\"seven-digit%20dialing\"&gt;seven-digit dialing&lt;/a&gt;. This area code was therefore scheduled to transition to &lt;a href=\"ten-digit%20dialing\"&gt;ten-digit dialing&lt;/a&gt; by October 24, 2021."
