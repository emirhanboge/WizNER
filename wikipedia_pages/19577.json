    "text": "Moses () is considered the most important &lt;a href=\"Prophets%20in%20Judaism\"&gt;prophet in Judaism&lt;/a&gt; and one of the most important &lt;a href=\"Prophets%20of%20Christianity\"&gt;prophets in Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prophets%20and%20messengers%20in%20Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Druze%20faith\"&gt;Druze faith&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Table%20of%20prophets%20of%20Abrahamic%20religions\"&gt;other Abrahamic religions&lt;/a&gt;. According to both the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Quran\"&gt;Quran&lt;/a&gt;, Moses was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Israelites\"&gt;Israelites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%20Moses\"&gt;lawgiver&lt;/a&gt; to whom the &lt;a href=\"Mosaic%20authorship\"&gt;authorship&lt;/a&gt;, or \"acquisition from heaven\", of the &lt;a href=\"Torah\"&gt;Torah&lt;/a&gt; (the first five books of the Bible) is attributed.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Exodus\"&gt;Book of Exodus&lt;/a&gt;, Moses was born in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were increasing in population and, as a result, the &lt;a href=\"Pharaohs%20in%20the%20Bible%23In%20the%20Book%20of%20Exodus\"&gt;Egyptian Pharaoh&lt;/a&gt; worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies. Moses's &lt;a href=\"Hebrews\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; mother, &lt;a href=\"Jochebed\"&gt;Jochebed&lt;/a&gt;, secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites. Through the Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen &lt;a href=\"Bithiah\"&gt;Bithia&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Midrash\"&gt;Midrash&lt;/a&gt;), the child was adopted as a &lt;a href=\"Child%20abandonment\"&gt;foundling&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Nile%20river\"&gt;Nile river&lt;/a&gt; and grew up with the Egyptian royal family. After killing an Egyptian slave-master who was beating a Hebrew, Moses fled across the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sea\"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Midian\"&gt;Midian&lt;/a&gt;, where he encountered the &lt;a href=\"Angel%20of%20the%20Lord\"&gt;Angel of the Lord&lt;/a&gt;, speaking to him from within a &lt;a href=\"burning%20bush\"&gt;burning bush&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Horeb\"&gt;Mount Horeb&lt;/a&gt;, which he regarded as the Mountain of God.\n&lt;a href=\"God%20in%20Judaism\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery. Moses said that he could not speak eloquently, so God allowed &lt;a href=\"Aaron\"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt;, his elder brother, to become his spokesperson. After the &lt;a href=\"Plagues%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;Ten Plagues&lt;/a&gt;, Moses led the &lt;a href=\"The%20Exodus\"&gt;Exodus of the Israelites&lt;/a&gt; out of Egypt and &lt;a href=\"Crossing%20the%20Red%20Sea\"&gt;across the Red Sea&lt;/a&gt;, after which they based themselves at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Sinai%20%28Bible%29\"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/a&gt;, where Moses received the &lt;a href=\"Ten%20Commandments\"&gt;Ten Commandments&lt;/a&gt;. After 40 years of wandering in the desert, Moses died on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Nebo\"&gt;Mount Nebo&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 120, within sight of the &lt;a href=\"Promised%20Land\"&gt;Promised Land&lt;/a&gt;.\nGenerally, Moses is seen as a &lt;a href=\"legend\"&gt;legend&lt;/a&gt;ary figure, whilst retaining the possibility that Moses or a Moses-like figure existed in the 13th century BCE. &lt;a href=\"Rabbinical%20Judaism\"&gt;Rabbinical Judaism&lt;/a&gt; calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391\u20131271 BCE; &lt;a href=\"Jerome\"&gt;Jerome&lt;/a&gt; suggested 1592 BCE, and &lt;a href=\"James%20Ussher\"&gt;James Ussher&lt;/a&gt; suggested 1571 BCE as his birth year.\nEtymology of name.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20language\"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; root \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Amsj\"&gt;msy&lt;/a&gt;\" ('child of') has been considered as a possible etymology, arguably an abbreviation of a &lt;a href=\"theophoric%20name\"&gt;theophoric name&lt;/a&gt;, as for example in Egyptian names like &lt;a href=\"Thutmose\"&gt;Thutmose&lt;/a&gt;s ('child of &lt;a href=\"Thoth\"&gt;Thoth&lt;/a&gt;') and &lt;a href=\"Ramesses%20I\"&gt;Ramesses&lt;/a&gt; ('child of &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt;'), with the god's name omitted. &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Yahuda\"&gt;Abraham Yahuda&lt;/a&gt;, based on the spelling given in the &lt;a href=\"Tanakh\"&gt;Tanakh&lt;/a&gt;, argues that it combines \"water\" or \"seed\" and \"pond, expanse of water,\" thus yielding the sense of \"child of the &lt;a href=\"Nile\"&gt;Nile&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Amw\"&gt;mw&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"wikt%3A%C5%A1\"&gt;\u0161&lt;/a&gt;\"). However, &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Kitchen\"&gt;Kenneth Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; argued that an Egyptian origin for the name was unlikely, as the sounds in the Hebrew \"m-\u0161-h\" do not correspond to the pronunciation of Egyptian \"msy\" in the relevant time period.\nThe biblical account of Moses's birth provides him with a &lt;a href=\"folk%20etymology\"&gt;folk etymology&lt;/a&gt; to explain the ostensible meaning of his name. He is said to have received it from the Pharaoh's daughter: \"he became her son. She named him Moses (\u05de\u05b9\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d4 \"M\u014d\u0161e\"), saying, 'I drew him out (\u05de\u05b0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05ea\u05b4\u05bd\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc \"m\u01dd\u0161\u012b\u1e6f\u012bh\u016b\") of the water'.\" This explanation links it to the Semitic root \u05de\u05e9\u05c1\u05d4 \"m-\u0161-h\", meaning \"to draw out\". The eleventh-century &lt;a href=\"Tosafot\"&gt;Tosafist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20ben%20Asher%20ha-Levi\"&gt;Isaac b. Asher haLevi&lt;/a&gt; noted that the princess names him the active participle Drawer-out (\u05de\u05b9\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d4 \"m\u014d\u0161e\"), not the passive participle Drawn-out (\u05e0\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d4 \"n\u012bm\u0161e\"), in effect prophesying that Moses would draw others out (of Egypt); this has been accepted by some scholars.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20language\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; etymology in the Biblical story may reflect an attempt to cancel out traces of Moses's &lt;a href=\"Egyptians\"&gt;Egyptian origins&lt;/a&gt;. The Egyptian character of his name was recognized as such by ancient Jewish writers like &lt;a href=\"Philo\"&gt;Philo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Josephus\"&gt;Josephus&lt;/a&gt;. Philo linked Moses's name () to the Egyptian (&lt;a href=\"Coptic%20language\"&gt;Coptic&lt;/a&gt;) word for 'water' (\"m\u00f6u\", ), in reference to his finding in the Nile and the biblical &lt;a href=\"folk%20etymology\"&gt;folk etymology&lt;/a&gt;. Josephus, in his \"&lt;a href=\"Antiquities%20of%20the%20Jews\"&gt;Antiquities of the Jews&lt;/a&gt;\", claims that the second element, \"-es\u00eas\", meant 'those who are saved'. The problem of how an Egyptian princess, known to Josephus as Thermutis (identified as Tharmuth) and to &lt;a href=\"1%20Chronicles\"&gt;1 Chronicles&lt;/a&gt; 4:18 as &lt;a href=\"Bithiah\"&gt;Bithiah&lt;/a&gt;, could have known Hebrew puzzled medieval Jewish commentators like &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20ibn%20Ezra\"&gt;Abraham ibn Ezra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hezekiah%20ben%20Manoah\"&gt;Hezekiah ben Manoah&lt;/a&gt;. Hezekiah suggested she either converted or took a tip from &lt;a href=\"Jochebed\"&gt;Jochebed&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiblical narrative.\nProphet and deliverer of Israel.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Israelites\"&gt;Israelites&lt;/a&gt; had settled in the &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20Goshen\"&gt;Land of Goshen&lt;/a&gt; in the time of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20%28patriarch%29\"&gt;Joseph&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jacob\"&gt;Jacob&lt;/a&gt;, but a new &lt;a href=\"Pharaohs%20in%20the%20Bible%23In%20the%20Book%20of%20Exodus\"&gt;Pharaoh&lt;/a&gt; arose who oppressed the children of Israel. At this time Moses was born to his father &lt;a href=\"Amram\"&gt;Amram&lt;/a&gt;, son (or descendant) of &lt;a href=\"Kehath\"&gt;Kehath&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Levite\"&gt;Levite&lt;/a&gt;, who entered Egypt with Jacob's household; his mother was &lt;a href=\"Jochebed\"&gt;Jochebed&lt;/a&gt; (also Yocheved), who was kin to Kehath. Moses had one older (by seven years) sister, &lt;a href=\"Miriam\"&gt;Miriam&lt;/a&gt;, and one older (by three years) brother, &lt;a href=\"Aaron\"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pharaoh had commanded that all male Hebrew children born would be drowned in the river &lt;a href=\"Nile\"&gt;Nile&lt;/a&gt;, but Moses's mother placed him in an &lt;a href=\"Ark%20of%20bulrushes\"&gt;ark&lt;/a&gt; and concealed the ark in the &lt;a href=\"bulrush\"&gt;bulrush&lt;/a&gt;es by the riverbank, where &lt;a href=\"Finding%20of%20Moses\"&gt;the baby was discovered&lt;/a&gt; and adopted by &lt;a href=\"Bithiah\"&gt;Pharaoh's daughter&lt;/a&gt;, and raised as an Egyptian. One day, after Moses had reached adulthood, he killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew. Moses, in order to escape the Pharaoh's &lt;a href=\"Capital%20punishment\"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt;, fled to &lt;a href=\"Midian\"&gt;Midian&lt;/a&gt; (a desert country south of Judah), where he married &lt;a href=\"Zipporah\"&gt;Zipporah&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere, on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Horeb\"&gt;Mount Horeb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; appeared to Moses as a &lt;a href=\"burning%20bush\"&gt;burning bush&lt;/a&gt;, revealed to Moses his name &lt;a href=\"Tetragrammaton\"&gt;YHWH&lt;/a&gt; (probably pronounced &lt;a href=\"Yahweh\"&gt;Yahweh&lt;/a&gt;) and commanded him to return to Egypt and bring his &lt;a href=\"Jews%20as%20the%20chosen%20people\"&gt;chosen people&lt;/a&gt; (Israel) out of bondage and into the &lt;a href=\"Promised%20Land\"&gt;Promised Land&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Canaan\"&gt;Canaan&lt;/a&gt;). During the journey, God tried to kill Moses, but &lt;a href=\"Zipporah%20at%20the%20inn\"&gt;Zipporah saved his life&lt;/a&gt;. Moses returned to carry out God's command, but God caused the Pharaoh to refuse, and only after God had subjected Egypt to &lt;a href=\"plagues%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;ten plagues&lt;/a&gt; did the Pharaoh relent. Moses led the Israelites to the border of Egypt, but there God hardened the Pharaoh's heart once more, so that he could destroy the Pharaoh and his army at the &lt;a href=\"Crossing%20the%20Red%20Sea\"&gt;Red Sea Crossing&lt;/a&gt; as a sign of his power to Israel and the nations.\nAfter defeating the &lt;a href=\"Amalekites\"&gt;Amalekites&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rephidim\"&gt;Rephidim&lt;/a&gt;, Moses &lt;a href=\"The%20Exodus\"&gt;led the Israelites&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Sinai%20%28Bible%29\"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/a&gt;, where he was given the &lt;a href=\"Ten%20Commandments\"&gt;Ten Commandments&lt;/a&gt; from God, written on &lt;a href=\"Stele\"&gt;stone tablets&lt;/a&gt;. However, since Moses remained a long time on the mountain, some of the people feared that he might be dead, so they made a statue of a &lt;a href=\"golden%20calf\"&gt;golden calf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20bull\"&gt;worshipped it&lt;/a&gt;, thus disobeying and angering God and Moses. Moses, out of anger, broke the tablets, and later ordered the elimination of those who had worshiped the golden statue, which was melted down and fed to the &lt;a href=\"Idolatry\"&gt;idolaters&lt;/a&gt;. He also wrote the ten commandments on a new set of tablets. Later at Mount Sinai, Moses and the elders entered into a covenant, by which Israel would become the people of YHWH, obeying his laws, and YHWH would be their god. Moses delivered the laws of God to Israel, instituted &lt;a href=\"Kohen\"&gt;the priesthood&lt;/a&gt; under the sons of Moses's brother &lt;a href=\"Aaron\"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt;, and destroyed those Israelites who fell away from his worship. In his final act at Sinai, God gave Moses instructions for the &lt;a href=\"Tabernacle\"&gt;Tabernacle&lt;/a&gt;, the mobile shrine by which he would travel with Israel to the Promised Land.\nFrom Sinai, Moses led the Israelites to the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20of%20Paran\"&gt;Desert of Paran&lt;/a&gt; on the border of Canaan. From there he sent &lt;a href=\"The%20Twelve%20Spies\"&gt;twelve spies&lt;/a&gt; into the land. The spies returned with samples of the land's fertility, but warned that its inhabitants were &lt;a href=\"Nephilim\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;. The people were afraid and wanted to return to Egypt, and some rebelled against Moses and against God. Moses told the Israelites that they were not worthy to inherit the land, and would wander the wilderness for forty years until the generation who had refused to enter Canaan had died, so that it would be their children who would possess the land. Later on, &lt;a href=\"Korah\"&gt;Korah&lt;/a&gt; was punished for leading a revolt against Moses.\nWhen the forty years had passed, Moses led the Israelites east around the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Sea\"&gt;Dead Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the territories of &lt;a href=\"Edom\"&gt;Edom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moab\"&gt;Moab&lt;/a&gt;. There they escaped the temptation of idolatry, conquered the lands of &lt;a href=\"Og\"&gt;Og&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sihon\"&gt;Sihon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Transjordan%20%28region%29\"&gt;Transjordan&lt;/a&gt;, received God's blessing through &lt;a href=\"Balaam\"&gt;Balaam&lt;/a&gt; the prophet, and massacred the &lt;a href=\"Midian\"&gt;Midian&lt;/a&gt;ites, who by the end of the Exodus journey had become the enemies of the Israelites due to their notorious role in &lt;a href=\"Heresy%20of%20Peor\"&gt;enticing the Israelites to sin against God&lt;/a&gt;. Moses was twice given notice that he would die before entry to the Promised Land: in &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Numbers\"&gt;Numbers&lt;/a&gt; 27:13, once he had seen the Promised Land from a viewpoint on &lt;a href=\"Abarim\"&gt;Mount Abarim&lt;/a&gt;, and again in Numbers 31:1 once battle with the Midianites had been won.\nOn the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20River\"&gt;Jordan River&lt;/a&gt;, in sight of the land, Moses assembled the &lt;a href=\"Tribes%20of%20Israel%23The%20Twelve%20Tribes\"&gt;tribes&lt;/a&gt;. After recalling their wanderings he delivered God's laws by which they must live in the land, sang a &lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20Moses\"&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; of praise and pronounced a &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Moses\"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt; on the people, and passed his authority to &lt;a href=\"Joshua\"&gt;Joshua&lt;/a&gt;, under whom they would possess the land. Moses then went up &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Nebo\"&gt;Mount Nebo&lt;/a&gt;, looked over the &lt;a href=\"Promised%20Land\"&gt;Promised Land&lt;/a&gt; spread out before him, and died, at the age of one hundred and twenty.\nLawgiver of Israel.\nMoses is honoured among &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; today as the \"lawgiver of Israel\", and he delivers several sets of laws in the course of the four books. The first is the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20Code\"&gt;Covenant Code&lt;/a&gt;, the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Mosaic%20covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; which God offers to the Israelites at Mount Sinai. Embedded in the covenant are the &lt;a href=\"Decalogue\"&gt;Decalogue&lt;/a&gt; and the Book of the Covenant. The entire &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Leviticus\"&gt;Book of Leviticus&lt;/a&gt; constitutes a second body of law, the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Numbers\"&gt;Book of Numbers&lt;/a&gt; begins with yet another set, and the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Deuteronomy\"&gt;Book of Deuteronomy&lt;/a&gt; another. \nMoses has traditionally been regarded as &lt;a href=\"Mosaic%20authorship\"&gt;the author of those four books&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Genesis\"&gt;Book of Genesis&lt;/a&gt;, which together comprise the &lt;a href=\"Torah\"&gt;Torah&lt;/a&gt;, the first section of the &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20Bible\"&gt;Hebrew Bible&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistoricity.\nScholars hold different opinions on the status of Moses in scholarship. For instance, according to &lt;a href=\"William%20G.%20Dever\"&gt;William G. Dever&lt;/a&gt;, the modern scholarly consensus is that the biblical person of Moses is largely mythical while also holding that \"a Moses-like figure may have existed somewhere in the southern &lt;a href=\"Transjordan%20%28Bible%29\"&gt;Transjordan&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-late 13th century B.C.\" and that \"archeology can do nothing\" to prove or confirm either way. However, according to Solomon Nigosian, there are actually three prevailing views among biblical scholars: one is that Moses is not a historical figure, another view strives to anchor the decisive role he played in Israelite religion, and a third that argues there are elements of both history and legend from which \"these issues are hotly debated unresolved matters among scholars.\" According to Brian Britt, there is divide amongst scholars when discussing matters on Moses that threatens gridlock.\n&lt;a href=\"Jan%20Assmann\"&gt;Jan Assmann&lt;/a&gt; argues that we \"cannot\" know if Moses ever lived because there are no traces of him outside tradition. Though the names of Moses and others in the biblical narratives are Egyptian and contain genuine Egyptian elements, no extrabiblical sources point clearly to Moses. No references to Moses appear in any Egyptian sources prior to the fourth century BCE, long after he is believed to have lived. No contemporary Egyptian sources mention Moses, or the events of Exodus\u2013Deuteronomy, nor has any archaeological evidence been discovered in Egypt or the &lt;a href=\"Sinai%20Peninsula\"&gt;Sinai wilderness&lt;/a&gt; to support the story in which he is the central figure. &lt;a href=\"David%20Adams%20Leeming\"&gt;David Adams Leeming&lt;/a&gt; states that Moses is a mythic hero and the central figure in Hebrew mythology. However, according to &lt;a href=\"John%20Van%20Seters\"&gt;John van Seters&lt;/a&gt;, any mythical elements in sources on Moses do not indicate that there was no Moses, nor that the tales do not include historical information, but that in the Torah, memory revises history and makes myths out of it.\nThe \"Oxford Companion to the Bible\" states that the historicity of Moses is the most reasonable assumption to be made about him as his absence would leave a vacuum that cannot be explained away. \"Oxford Biblical Studies\" states that although few modern scholars are willing to support the traditional view that Moses himself wrote the five books of the &lt;a href=\"Torah\"&gt;Torah&lt;/a&gt;, there are certainly those who regard the leadership of Moses as too firmly based in Israel's corporate memory to be dismissed as pious fiction.\nThe story of Moses's discovery picks up a familiar motif in &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Near%20East\"&gt;ancient Near East&lt;/a&gt;ern &lt;a href=\"Mythology\"&gt;mythological accounts&lt;/a&gt; of the ruler who rises from humble origins. Thus &lt;a href=\"Sargon%20of%20Akkad\"&gt;Sargon of Akkad&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Akkadian%20language\"&gt;Akkadian&lt;/a&gt; account of his own origins runs:\n&lt;poem&gt;My mother, the high priestess, conceived; in secret she bore me\nShe set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid\nShe cast me into the river which rose over me.&lt;/poem&gt;\nMoses's story, like those of the other patriarchs, most likely had a substantial oral prehistory, (he is mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Jeremiah\"&gt;Book of Jeremiah&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Isaiah\"&gt;Book of Isaiah&lt;/a&gt;) and his name is apparently very ancient, as the tradition found in Exodus no longer understands its original meaning. Nevertheless, the completion of the Torah and its elevation to the centre of post-Exilic Judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones \u2013 the final Pentateuch was based on existing traditions. &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Isaiah\"&gt;Isaiah&lt;/a&gt;, written during the Exile (i.e., in the first half of the 6th century BCE), testifies of tension between the people of Judah and the returning post-Exilic Jews (the \"&lt;a href=\"Golah\"&gt;g\u00f4l\u00e2&lt;/a&gt;\"), stating that God is the father of Israel and that Israel's history begins with the Exodus and not with &lt;a href=\"Abraham\"&gt;Abraham&lt;/a&gt;. The conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence (e.g., the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Ezra\"&gt;Book of Ezra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Nehemiah\"&gt;Book of Nehemiah&lt;/a&gt;), is that the figure of Moses and the story of the Exodus must have been preeminent among the people of Judah at the time of the Exile and after, serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles.\n&lt;a href=\"Kenite%20hypothesis\"&gt;A theory&lt;/a&gt; developed by &lt;a href=\"Cornelis%20Tiele\"&gt;Cornelis Tiele&lt;/a&gt; in 1872, which has proved influential, argued that &lt;a href=\"Yahweh\"&gt;Yahweh&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"Midian\"&gt;Midian&lt;/a&gt;ite god, introduced to the Israelites by Moses, whose father-in-law &lt;a href=\"Jethro%20%28Bible%29\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt; was a Midianite priest. It was to such a Moses that Yahweh reveals his real name, hidden from the &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs%20%28Bible%29\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt; who knew him only as &lt;a href=\"El%20Shaddai\"&gt;El Shaddai&lt;/a&gt;. Against this view is the modern consensus that most of the Israelites were native to &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Noth\"&gt;Martin Noth&lt;/a&gt; argued that the &lt;a href=\"Torah\"&gt;Pentateuch&lt;/a&gt; uses the figure of Moses, originally linked to legends of a Transjordan conquest, as a narrative bracket or late redactional device to weld together 4 of the 5, originally independent, themes of that work.\n and , the latter in a somewhat &lt;a href=\"Sensationalism\"&gt;sensationalist&lt;/a&gt; manner, have suggested that the Moses story is a distortion or transmogrification of the historical pharaoh &lt;a href=\"Amenmesse\"&gt;Amenmose&lt;/a&gt; (c. 1200 BCE), who was dismissed from office and whose name was later simplified to \"msy\" (Mose). &lt;a href=\"Aidan%20Dodson\"&gt;Aidan Dodson&lt;/a&gt; regards this hypothesis as \"intriguing, but beyond proof.\" Rudolf Smend argues that the two details about Moses that were most likely to be historical are his name, of Egyptian origin, and his marriage to a Midianite woman, details which seem unlikely to have been invented by the Israelites; in Smend's view, all other details given in the biblical narrative are too mythically charged to be seen as accurate data.\nThe name &lt;a href=\"Mesha\"&gt;King Mesha&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Moab\"&gt;Moab&lt;/a&gt; has been linked to that of Moses. Mesha also is associated with narratives of an exodus and a conquest, and several motifs in stories about him are shared with the Exodus tale and that regarding Israel's war with Moab (&lt;a href=\"2%20Kings%203\"&gt;2 Kings 3&lt;/a&gt;). Moab rebels against oppression, like Moses, leads his people out of Israel, as Moses does from Egypt, and his first-born son is slaughtered at the wall of &lt;a href=\"Kir%20of%20Moab\"&gt;Kir-hareseth&lt;/a&gt; as the firstborn of Israel are condemned to slaughter in the Exodus story, in what Calvinist theologian &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Leithart\"&gt;Peter Leithart&lt;/a&gt; described as \"an infernal Passover that delivers Mesha while wrath burns against his enemies\".\nAn Egyptian version of the tale that crosses over with the Moses story is found in &lt;a href=\"Manetho\"&gt;Manetho&lt;/a&gt; who, according to the summary in &lt;a href=\"Josephus\"&gt;Josephus&lt;/a&gt;, wrote that a certain &lt;a href=\"Osarseph\"&gt;Osarseph&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Heliopolis%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29\"&gt;Heliopolitan&lt;/a&gt; priest, became overseer of a band of &lt;a href=\"Leprosy\"&gt;lepers&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Amenhotep%20III\"&gt;Amenophis&lt;/a&gt;, following indications by &lt;a href=\"Amenhotep%2C%20son%20of%20Hapu\"&gt;Amenhotep, son of Hapu&lt;/a&gt;, had all the lepers in Egypt quarantined in order to cleanse the land so that he might see the gods. The lepers are bundled into &lt;a href=\"Avaris\"&gt;Avaris&lt;/a&gt;, the former capital of the &lt;a href=\"Hyksos\"&gt;Hyksos&lt;/a&gt;, where Osarseph prescribes for them everything forbidden in Egypt, while proscribing everything permitted in Egypt. They invite the Hyksos to reinvade Egypt, rule with them for 13 years \u2013 Osarseph then assumes the name Moses \u2013 and are then driven out.\nOther Egyptian figures which have been postulated as candidates for a historical Moses-like figure include the princes &lt;a href=\"Ahmose-ankh\"&gt;Ahmose-ankh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ramose%20%28prince%29\"&gt;Ramose&lt;/a&gt;, who were sons of pharaoh &lt;a href=\"Ahmose%20I\"&gt;Ahmose I&lt;/a&gt;, or a figure associated with the family of pharaoh &lt;a href=\"Thutmose%20III\"&gt;Thutmose III&lt;/a&gt;. Israel Knohl has proposed to identify Moses with &lt;a href=\"Irsu\"&gt;Irsu&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Shasu\"&gt;Shasu&lt;/a&gt; who, according to &lt;a href=\"Papyrus%20Harris%20I\"&gt;Papyrus Harris I&lt;/a&gt; and the Elephantine Stele, took power in Egypt with the support of \"Asiatics\" (people from the &lt;a href=\"Levant\"&gt;Levant&lt;/a&gt;) after the death of Queen &lt;a href=\"Twosret\"&gt;Twosret&lt;/a&gt;; after coming to power, Irsu and his supporters disrupted Egyptian rituals, \"treating the gods like the people\" and halting offerings to the Egyptian deities. They were eventually defeated and expelled by the new Pharaoh &lt;a href=\"Setnakhte\"&gt;Setnakhte&lt;/a&gt; and, while fleeing, they abandoned large quantities of gold and silver they had stolen from the temples.\nHellenistic literature.\nNon-biblical writings about Jews, with references to the role of Moses, first appear at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Hellenistic%20period\"&gt;Hellenistic period&lt;/a&gt;, from 323\u00a0BCE to about 146\u00a0BCE. Shmuel notes that \"a characteristic of this literature is the high honour in which it holds the peoples of the East in general and some specific groups among these peoples.\"\nIn addition to the Judeo-Roman or Judeo-Hellenic historians &lt;a href=\"Artapanus%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;Artapanus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eupolemus\"&gt;Eupolemus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Josephus\"&gt;Josephus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Philo\"&gt;Philo&lt;/a&gt;, a few non-Jewish historians including &lt;a href=\"Hecataeus%20of%20Abdera\"&gt;Hecataeus of Abdera&lt;/a&gt; (quoted by &lt;a href=\"Diodorus%20Siculus\"&gt;Diodorus Siculus&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Polyhistor\"&gt;Alexander Polyhistor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manetho\"&gt;Manetho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apion\"&gt;Apion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaeremon%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;Chaeremon of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tacitus\"&gt;Tacitus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porphyry%20%28philosopher%29\"&gt;Porphyry&lt;/a&gt; also make reference to him. The extent to which any of these accounts rely on earlier sources is unknown. Moses also appears in other religious texts such as the &lt;a href=\"Mishnah\"&gt;Mishnah&lt;/a&gt; (c.\u00a0200\u00a0CE), &lt;a href=\"Midrash\"&gt;Midrash&lt;/a&gt; (200\u20131200\u00a0CE), and the &lt;a href=\"Quran\"&gt;Quran&lt;/a&gt; (c. 610\u2013653).\nThe figure of &lt;a href=\"Osarseph\"&gt;Osarseph&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Greek%20historiography\"&gt;Hellenistic historiography&lt;/a&gt; is a renegade Egyptian priest who leads an army of lepers against the pharaoh and is finally expelled from Egypt, changing his name to Moses.\nHecataeus.\nThe earliest existing reference to Moses in Greek literature occurs in the Egyptian history of Hecataeus of Abdera (4th\u00a0century\u00a0BCE). All that remains of his description of Moses are two references made by Diodorus Siculus, wherein, writes historian Arthur Droge, he \"describes Moses as a wise and courageous leader who left Egypt and colonized &lt;a href=\"Judea\"&gt;Judaea&lt;/a&gt;.\" Among the many accomplishments described by Hecataeus, Moses had founded cities, established a temple and religious cult, and issued laws:\nDroge also points out that this statement by Hecataeus was similar to statements made subsequently by Eupolemus.\nArtapanus.\nThe Jewish historian &lt;a href=\"Artapanus%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;Artapanus of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt; (2nd century BCE), portrayed Moses as a cultural hero, alien to the Pharaonic court. According to theologian John Barclay, the Moses of Artapanus \"clearly bears the destiny of the Jews, and in his personal, cultural and military splendor, brings credit to the whole Jewish people.\"\nArtapanus goes on to relate how Moses returns to Egypt with Aaron, and is imprisoned, but miraculously escapes through the name of &lt;a href=\"YHWH\"&gt;YHWH&lt;/a&gt; in order to lead the Exodus. This account further testifies that all Egyptian &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20temple\"&gt;temples&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Isis\"&gt;Isis&lt;/a&gt; thereafter contained a rod, in remembrance of that used for Moses's miracles. He describes Moses as 80 years old, \"tall and ruddy, with long white hair, and dignified.\"\nSome historians, however, point out the \"&lt;a href=\"Apologetics\"&gt;apologetic&lt;/a&gt; nature of much of Artapanus' work,\" with his addition of extra-biblical details, such as his references to Jethro: the non-Jewish Jethro expresses admiration for Moses's gallantry in helping his daughters, and chooses to adopt Moses as his son.\nStrabo.\n&lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt;, a Greek historian, geographer and philosopher, in his \"&lt;a href=\"Geographica\"&gt;Geographica&lt;/a&gt;\" (c.\u00a024\u00a0CE), wrote in detail about Moses, whom he considered to be an Egyptian who deplored the situation in his homeland, and thereby attracted many followers who respected the deity. He writes, for example, that Moses opposed the picturing of the deity in the form of man or animal, and was convinced that the deity was an entity which encompassed everything \u2013 land and sea:\nIn Strabo's writings of the history of &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt; as he understood it, he describes various stages in its development: from the first stage, including Moses and his direct heirs; to the final stage where \"the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Temple of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; continued to be surrounded by an aura of sanctity.\" Strabo's \"positive and unequivocal appreciation of Moses' personality is among the most sympathetic in all ancient literature.\" His portrayal of Moses is said to be similar to the writing of &lt;a href=\"Hecataeus%20of%20Abdera\"&gt;Hecataeus&lt;/a&gt; who \"described Moses as a man who excelled in wisdom and courage.\"\nEgyptologist &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Assmann\"&gt;Jan Assmann&lt;/a&gt; concludes that Strabo was the historian \"who came closest to a construction of Moses' religion as &lt;a href=\"monotheism\"&gt;monotheistic&lt;/a&gt; and as a pronounced counter-religion.\" It recognized \"only one divine being whom no image can represent... [and] the only way to approach this god is to live in virtue and in justice.\"\nTacitus.\nThe Roman historian &lt;a href=\"Tacitus\"&gt;Tacitus&lt;/a&gt; (c. 56\u2013120\u00a0CE) refers to Moses by noting that the Jewish religion was monotheistic and without a clear image. His primary work, wherein he describes &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20philosophy\"&gt;Jewish philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, is his \"&lt;a href=\"Histories%20%28Tacitus%29\"&gt;Histories&lt;/a&gt;\" (c. 100), where, according to 18th-century translator and Irish dramatist &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Murphy%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Arthur Murphy&lt;/a&gt;, as a result of the Jewish worship of one God, \"&lt;a href=\"paganism\"&gt;pagan&lt;/a&gt; mythology fell into contempt.\" Tacitus states that, despite various opinions current in his day regarding the Jews' ethnicity, most of his sources are in agreement that there was an Exodus from Egypt. By his account, the Pharaoh &lt;a href=\"Bakenranef\"&gt;Bocchoris&lt;/a&gt;, suffering from a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20%28disease%29\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;, banished the Jews in response to an oracle of the god &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Amun\"&gt;Amun&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this version, Moses and the Jews wander through the desert for only six days, capturing the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Land\"&gt;Holy Land&lt;/a&gt; on the seventh.\nLonginus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Septuagint\"&gt;Septuagint&lt;/a&gt;, the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible, impressed the pagan author of the famous classical book of literary criticism, \"&lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Sublime\"&gt;On the Sublime&lt;/a&gt;\", traditionally attributed to &lt;a href=\"Longinus%20%28literature%29\"&gt;Longinus&lt;/a&gt;. The date of composition is unknown, but it is commonly assigned to the late 1st century C.E.\nThe writer quotes &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Genesis\"&gt;Genesis&lt;/a&gt; in a \"style which presents the nature of the deity in a manner suitable to his pure and great being,\" however he does not mention Moses by name, calling him 'no chance person' () but \"the Lawgiver\" (, &lt;a href=\"Archon%23Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;thesmothete&lt;/a&gt;) of the Jews,\" a term that puts him on a par with &lt;a href=\"Lycurgus%20of%20Sparta\"&gt;Lycurgus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minos\"&gt;Minos&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from a reference to &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt;, Moses is the only non-Greek writer quoted in the work, contextually he is put on a par with &lt;a href=\"Homer\"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt;. and he is described \"with far more admiration than even Greek writers who treated Moses with respect, such as &lt;a href=\"Hecataeus%20of%20Abdera\"&gt;Hecataeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt;.\nJosephus.\nIn Josephus' (37 \u2013 c.\u00a0100 CE) \"Antiquities of the Jews\", Moses is mentioned throughout. For example Book VIII Ch. IV, describes &lt;a href=\"Solomon%27s%20Temple\"&gt;Solomon's Temple&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the First Temple, at the time the &lt;a href=\"Ark%20of%20the%20Covenant\"&gt;Ark of the Covenant&lt;/a&gt; was first moved into the newly built temple:\nAccording to Feldman, Josephus also attaches particular significance to Moses's possession of the \"cardinal virtues of wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice.\" He also includes piety as an added fifth virtue. In addition, he \"stresses Moses' willingness to undergo toil and his careful avoidance of bribery. Like &lt;a href=\"Plato\"&gt;Plato&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Philosopher%20king\"&gt;philosopher-king&lt;/a&gt;, Moses excels as an educator.\"\nNumenius.\n&lt;a href=\"Numenius%20of%20Apamea\"&gt;Numenius&lt;/a&gt;, a Greek philosopher who was a native of &lt;a href=\"Apamea%2C%20Syria\"&gt;Apamea&lt;/a&gt;, in Syria, wrote during the latter half of the 2nd century CE. Historian Kennieth Guthrie writes that \"Numenius is perhaps the only recognized Greek philosopher who explicitly studied Moses, the prophets, and the life of &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt;...\" He describes his background:\nJustin Martyr.\nThe Christian saint and religious philosopher &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Martyr\"&gt;Justin Martyr&lt;/a&gt; (103\u2013165 CE) drew the same conclusion as &lt;a href=\"Numenius%20of%20Apamea\"&gt;Numenius&lt;/a&gt;, according to other experts. Theologian Paul Blackham notes that Justin considered Moses to be \"more trustworthy, profound and truthful because he is \"older\" than the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek%20philosophy\"&gt;Greek philosophers&lt;/a&gt;.\" He quotes him:\nAbrahamic religions.\nJudaism.\nMost of what is known about Moses from the Bible comes from the books of &lt;a href=\"book%20of%20Exodus\"&gt;Exodus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Leviticus\"&gt;Leviticus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"book%20of%20Numbers\"&gt;Numbers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Deuteronomy\"&gt;Deuteronomy&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of scholars consider the compilation of these books to go back to the &lt;a href=\"Yehud%20Medinata\"&gt;Persian period&lt;/a&gt;, 538\u2013332\u00a0BCE, but based on earlier written and oral traditions. There is a wealth of stories and additional information about Moses in the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20apocrypha\"&gt;Jewish apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; and in the genre of &lt;a href=\"rabbi\"&gt;rabbi&lt;/a&gt;nical &lt;a href=\"exegesis\"&gt;exegesis&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Midrash\"&gt;Midrash&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in the primary works of the Jewish &lt;a href=\"oral%20law\"&gt;oral law&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mishnah\"&gt;Mishnah&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Talmud\"&gt;Talmud&lt;/a&gt;. Moses is also given a number of bynames in Jewish tradition. The &lt;a href=\"Midrash\"&gt;Midrash&lt;/a&gt; identifies Moses as one of seven biblical personalities who were called by various names. Moses's other names were Jekuthiel (by his mother), Heber (by &lt;a href=\"Amram\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;), Jered (by &lt;a href=\"Miriam\"&gt;Miriam&lt;/a&gt;), Avi Zanoah (by Aaron), &lt;a href=\"Avigdor%20%28name%29\"&gt;Avi Gedor&lt;/a&gt; (by &lt;a href=\"Kohath\"&gt;Kohath&lt;/a&gt;), Avi Soco (by his wet-nurse), Shemaiah ben Nethanel (by people of Israel). Moses is also attributed the names Toviah (as a first name), and Levi (as a family name) (Vayikra Rabbah 1:3), Heman, Mechoqeiq (lawgiver) and Ehl Gav Ish (Numbers 12:3). In another &lt;a href=\"exegesis\"&gt;exegesis&lt;/a&gt;, Moses had ascended to the first heaven until the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Heavens\"&gt;seventh&lt;/a&gt;, even visited &lt;a href=\"Paradise\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hell\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; alive, after he saw the &lt;a href=\"burning%20bush\"&gt;Divine vision&lt;/a&gt; in Mount Horeb.\nJewish historians who lived at &lt;a href=\"Alexandria\"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Eupolemus\"&gt;Eupolemus&lt;/a&gt;, attributed to Moses the feat of having taught the &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia\"&gt;Phoenicia&lt;/a&gt;ns &lt;a href=\"Phoenician%20alphabet\"&gt;their alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, similar to legends of &lt;a href=\"Thoth\"&gt;Thoth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Artapanus%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;Artapanus of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt; explicitly identified Moses not only with Thoth/&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;, but also with the Greek figure &lt;a href=\"Musaeus%20of%20Athens\"&gt;Musaeus&lt;/a&gt; (whom he called \"the teacher of &lt;a href=\"Orpheus\"&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt;\"), and ascribed to him the division of Egypt into 36 districts, each with its own liturgy. He named the princess who adopted Moses as Merris, wife of Pharaoh Chenephres.\nJewish tradition considers Moses to be the greatest prophet who ever lived. Despite his importance, Judaism stresses that Moses was a human being, and is therefore not to be worshipped. Only God is worthy of worship in Judaism.\nTo &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20Judaism\"&gt;Orthodox Jews&lt;/a&gt;, Moses is called \"Moshe Rabbenu, `Eved HaShem, Avi haNeviim zya\"a\": \"Our Leader Moshe, Servant of God, Father of all the Prophets (may his merit shield us, amen)\". In the orthodox view, Moses received not only the Torah, but also the revealed (written and oral) and the hidden (the \"`hokhmat nistar\" teachings, which gave Judaism the &lt;a href=\"Zohar\"&gt;Zohar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shimon%20bar%20Yochai\"&gt;Rashbi&lt;/a&gt;, the Torah of the &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Luria\"&gt;Ari haQadosh&lt;/a&gt; and all that is discussed in the Heavenly Yeshiva between the &lt;a href=\"Moshe%20Chaim%20Luzzatto\"&gt;Ramhal&lt;/a&gt; and his masters).\nArising in part from his age of death (120 years, according to Deut. 34:7) and that \"his eye had not dimmed, and his vigor had not diminished,\" the phrase \"&lt;a href=\"Live%20until%20120\"&gt;may you live to 120&lt;/a&gt;\" has become a common blessing among Jews (120 is stated as the maximum age for all of &lt;a href=\"Noah\"&gt;Noah&lt;/a&gt;'s descendants in Genesis 6:3).\nChristianity.\nMoses is mentioned more often in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Testament\"&gt;New Testament&lt;/a&gt; than any other &lt;a href=\"Old%20Testament\"&gt;Old Testament&lt;/a&gt; figure. For &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt;, Moses is often a symbol of &lt;a href=\"Divine%20law\"&gt;God's law&lt;/a&gt;, as reinforced and &lt;a href=\"Expounding%20of%20the%20Law\"&gt;expounded on&lt;/a&gt; in the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt;. New Testament writers often compared Jesus's words and deeds with Moses's to explain Jesus's mission. In &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles\"&gt;Acts&lt;/a&gt; 7:39\u201343, 51\u201353, for example, the rejection of Moses by the Jews who worshipped the &lt;a href=\"golden%20calf\"&gt;golden calf&lt;/a&gt; is likened to the rejection of Jesus by the Jews that continued in traditional Judaism.\nMoses also figures in several of Jesus's messages. When he met the &lt;a href=\"Pharisees\"&gt;Pharisee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nicodemus\"&gt;Nicodemus&lt;/a&gt; at night in the third chapter of the &lt;a href=\"Gospel%20of%20John\"&gt;Gospel of John&lt;/a&gt;, he compared Moses's lifting up of the &lt;a href=\"Nehushtan\"&gt;bronze serpent&lt;/a&gt; in the wilderness, which any Israelite could look at and be healed, to his own lifting up (by his death and &lt;a href=\"resurrection\"&gt;resurrection&lt;/a&gt;) for the people to look at and be healed. In the sixth chapter, Jesus responded to the people's claim that Moses provided them \"&lt;a href=\"manna\"&gt;manna&lt;/a&gt;\" in the wilderness by saying that it was not Moses, but God, who provided. Calling himself the \"&lt;a href=\"Bread%20of%20Life%20Discourse\"&gt;bread of life&lt;/a&gt;\", Jesus stated that he was provided to feed God's people.\nMoses, along with &lt;a href=\"Elijah\"&gt;Elijah&lt;/a&gt;, is presented as meeting with Jesus in all three &lt;a href=\"Synoptic%20Gospels\"&gt;Synoptic Gospels&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Transfiguration%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Transfiguration of Jesus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Matthew%2017\"&gt;Matthew 17&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mark%209\"&gt;Mark 9&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Luke%209\"&gt;Luke 9&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. In &lt;a href=\"Matthew%2023\"&gt;Matthew 23&lt;/a&gt;, in what is the first attested use of a phrase referring to this rabbinical usage (the Graeco-Aramaic \u05e7\u05ea\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05de\u05e9\u05d4), Jesus refers to the scribes and the Pharisees, in a passage critical of them, as having seated themselves \"on the chair of Moses\" (, \"ep\u00ec t\u0113s M\u014d\u00fcs\u00e9\u014ds kath\u00e9dras\") \nHis relevance to modern Christianity has not diminished. Moses is considered to be a &lt;a href=\"saint\"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt; by several churches; and is commemorated as a prophet in the respective &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20of%20saints\"&gt;Calendars of Saints&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; churches on September 4. In &lt;a href=\"September%204%20%28Eastern%20Orthodox%20liturgics%29\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox liturgics&lt;/a&gt; for September 4, Moses is commemorated as the \"Holy Prophet and God-seer Moses, on Mount Nebo\". The Orthodox Church also commemorates him on the &lt;a href=\"Nativity%20Fast%23Sunday%20of%20the%20Forefathers\"&gt;Sunday of the Forefathers&lt;/a&gt;, two Sundays before the &lt;a href=\"Nativity%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Nativity&lt;/a&gt;. Moses is also commemorated on July 20 with &lt;a href=\"Aaron\"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elijah\"&gt;Elijah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elisha\"&gt;Elisha&lt;/a&gt; and on April 14 with all saint &lt;a href=\"Sinaia%20Monastery\"&gt;Sinai&lt;/a&gt; monks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20Apostolic%20Church\"&gt;Armenian Apostolic Church&lt;/a&gt; commemorates him as one of the Holy Forefathers in their &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20of%20Saints%20%28Armenian%20Apostolic%20Church%29\"&gt;Calendar of Saints&lt;/a&gt; on July 30.\nMormonism.\nMembers of &lt;a href=\"The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints\"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt; (colloquially called &lt;a href=\"Mormons\"&gt;Mormons&lt;/a&gt;) generally view Moses in the same way that other Christians do. However, in addition to accepting the biblical account of Moses, Mormons include &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Moses\"&gt;Selections from the Book of Moses&lt;/a&gt; as part of their scriptural canon. This book is believed to be the translated writings of Moses, and is included in the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Great%20Price%20%28Mormonism%29\"&gt;Pearl of Great Price&lt;/a&gt;.\nLatter-day Saints are also unique in believing that Moses was taken to heaven without having tasted death (&lt;a href=\"Translation%20%28LDS%20Church%29\"&gt;translated&lt;/a&gt;). In addition, &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Smith\"&gt;Joseph Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Cowdery\"&gt;Oliver Cowdery&lt;/a&gt; stated that on April 3, 1836, Moses appeared to them in the &lt;a href=\"Kirtland%20Temple\"&gt;Kirtland Temple&lt;/a&gt; (located in &lt;a href=\"Kirtland%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Kirtland, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;) in a glorified, immortal, physical form and bestowed upon them the \"keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the &lt;a href=\"Ten%20Lost%20Tribes%23Latter-day%20Saint%20Movement\"&gt;ten tribes&lt;/a&gt; from the land of the north.\"\nIslam.\nMoses is mentioned more in the &lt;a href=\"Quran\"&gt;Quran&lt;/a&gt; than any other individual and his life is narrated and recounted more than that of any other &lt;a href=\"Prophets%20of%20Islam\"&gt;Islamic prophet&lt;/a&gt;. Islamically, Moses is described in ways which parallel the Islamic prophet &lt;a href=\"Muhammad\"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;. Like Muhammad, Moses is defined in the Quran as both prophet (\"nabi\") and messenger (\"&lt;a href=\"Prophets%20and%20messengers%20in%20Islam\"&gt;rasul&lt;/a&gt;\"), the latter term indicating that he was one of those prophets who brought a scripture and law to his people.\nMoses is mentioned &lt;a href=\"Moses%20in%20Islam%23Qur%27anic%20references\"&gt;502 times in the Quran&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the key events in Moses's life which are narrated in the Bible are to be found dispersed through the different chapters (\"&lt;a href=\"suwar\"&gt;suwar&lt;/a&gt;\") of the Quran, with a story about meeting &lt;a href=\"Khidr\"&gt;Khidr&lt;/a&gt; which is not found in the Bible.\nIn the Moses story related by the Quran, Jochebed is commanded by God to place Moses in an ark and cast him on the waters of the Nile, thus abandoning him completely to God's protection. The Pharaoh's wife &lt;a href=\"Asiya\"&gt;Asiya&lt;/a&gt;, not his daughter, found Moses floating in the waters of the Nile. She convinced the Pharaoh to keep him as their son because they were not blessed with any children.\nThe Quran's account has emphasized Moses's mission to invite the Pharaoh to accept God's divine message as well as give salvation to the Israelites. According to the Quran, Moses encourages the Israelites to enter Canaan, but they are unwilling to fight the Canaanites, fearing certain defeat. Moses responds by pleading to Allah that he and his brother Aaron be separated from the rebellious Israelites. After which the Israelites are made to wander for 40 years.\nOne of the &lt;a href=\"hadith\"&gt;hadith&lt;/a&gt;, or traditional narratives about Muhammad's life, describes a meeting in heaven between Moses and Muhammad, which resulted in Muslims observing &lt;a href=\"Salah\"&gt;5 daily prayers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Huston%20Smith\"&gt;Huston Smith&lt;/a&gt; says this was \"one of the crucial events in Muhammad's life\".\nAccording to some Islamic tradition, Moses is believed to be buried at &lt;a href=\"Nabi%20Musa\"&gt;Maqam El-Nabi Musa&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Jericho\"&gt;Jericho&lt;/a&gt;.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nMoses is one of the most important of God's messengers in the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith&lt;/a&gt;, being designated a &lt;a href=\"Manifestation%20of%20God%20%28Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith%29\"&gt;Manifestation of God&lt;/a&gt;. An epithet of Moses in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scriptures is the \"One Who Conversed with God\".\nAccording to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h\"&gt;Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the faith, is the one who spoke to Moses from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20bush\"&gt;Burning bush&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1\"&gt;Abdul\u2019l-Baha&lt;/a&gt;, has highlighted the fact that Moses, like &lt;a href=\"Abraham\"&gt;Abraham&lt;/a&gt;, had none of the makings of a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Man%20theory\"&gt;great man of history&lt;/a&gt;, but through God's assistance he was able to achieve many great things. He is described as having been \"for a long time a shepherd in the wilderness,\" of having had a &lt;a href=\"Stuttering\"&gt;stammer&lt;/a&gt;, and of being \"much hated and detested\" by the Pharaoh and the ancient Egyptians of his time. He is said to have been raised in an oppressive household, and to have been known, in Egypt, as a man who had committed murder \u2013 though he had done so in order to prevent an act of cruelty.\nNevertheless, like Abraham, through the assistance of God, he achieved great things and gained renown even beyond the &lt;a href=\"Levant\"&gt;Levant&lt;/a&gt;. Chief among these achievements was the freeing of his people, the Hebrews, from bondage in Egypt and leading \"them to the Holy Land.\" He is viewed as the one who bestowed on Israel 'the religious and the civil law' which gave them \"honour among all nations,\" and which spread their fame to different parts of the world.\nFurthermore, through the law, Moses is believed to have led the Hebrews 'to the highest possible degree of &lt;a href=\"civilization\"&gt;civilization&lt;/a&gt; at that period.\u2019 Abdul\u2019l-Baha asserts that the ancient Greek philosophers regarded \"the illustrious men of Israel as models of perfection.\" Chief among these philosophers, he says, was &lt;a href=\"Socrates\"&gt;Socrates&lt;/a&gt; who \"visited Syria, and took from the children of Israel the teachings of the Unity of God and of the immortality of the soul.\"\nMoses is further seen as paving the way for &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h\"&gt;Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h&lt;/a&gt; and his ultimate revelation, and as a teacher of truth, whose teachings were in line with the customs of his time.\nDruze faith.\nMoses is considered an important prophet of God in the &lt;a href=\"Druze%20faith\"&gt;Druze faith&lt;/a&gt;, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history.\nLegacy in politics and law.\nIn a metaphorical sense in the Christian tradition, a \"Moses\" has been referred to as the leader who delivers the people from a terrible situation. Among the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Presidents of the United States&lt;/a&gt; known to have used the symbolism of Moses were &lt;a href=\"Harry%20S.%20Truman\"&gt;Harry S. Truman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Carter\"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Reagan\"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, who referred to his supporters as \"the Moses generation.\"\nIn subsequent years, theologians linked the Ten Commandments with the formation of early &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt;. Scottish theologian &lt;a href=\"William%20Barclay%20%28theologian%29\"&gt;William Barclay&lt;/a&gt; described them as \"the universal foundation of all things\u2026 the law without which &lt;a href=\"nation\"&gt;nation&lt;/a&gt;hood is impossible. \u2026Our society is founded upon it. &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Francis\"&gt;Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt; addressed the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 stating that all people need to \"keep alive their sense of unity by means of just legislation... [and] the figure of Moses leads us directly to God and thus to the transcendent dignity of the human being.\nIn US history.\nPilgrims.\nReferences to Moses were used by the &lt;a href=\"Puritans\"&gt;Puritans&lt;/a&gt;, who relied on the story of Moses to give meaning and hope to the lives of &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%20Fathers\"&gt;Pilgrims&lt;/a&gt; seeking &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20of%20religion\"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Civil%20liberties\"&gt;personal freedom&lt;/a&gt; in North America. &lt;a href=\"John%20Carver%20%28Plymouth%20Colony%20governor%29\"&gt;John Carver&lt;/a&gt; was the first governor of &lt;a href=\"Plymouth%20colony\"&gt;Plymouth colony&lt;/a&gt; and first signer of the &lt;a href=\"Mayflower%20Compact\"&gt;Mayflower Compact&lt;/a&gt;, which he wrote in 1620 during the ship \"&lt;a href=\"Mayflower\"&gt;Mayflower&lt;/a&gt;\"'s three-month voyage. He inspired the Pilgrims with a \"sense of earthly grandeur and divine purpose,\" notes historian &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Meacham\"&gt;Jon Meacham&lt;/a&gt;, and was called the \"Moses of the Pilgrims.\" Early American writer &lt;a href=\"James%20Russell%20Lowell\"&gt;James Russell Lowell&lt;/a&gt; noted the similarity of the founding of America by the Pilgrims to that of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20ancient%20Israel%20and%20Judah\"&gt;ancient Israel&lt;/a&gt; by Moses:\nFollowing Carver's death the following year, &lt;a href=\"William%20Bradford%20%28Plymouth%20Colony%20governor%29\"&gt;William Bradford&lt;/a&gt; was made governor. He feared that the remaining Pilgrims would not survive the hardships of the new land, with half their people having already died within months of arriving. Bradford evoked the symbol of Moses to the weakened and desperate Pilgrims to help calm them and give them hope: \"Violence will break all. Where is the meek and humble spirit of Moses?\" &lt;a href=\"William%20G.%20Dever\"&gt;William G. Dever&lt;/a&gt; explains the attitude of the Pilgrims: \"We considered ourselves the 'New Israel,' particularly we in America. And for that reason we knew who we were, what we believed in and valued, and what our '&lt;a href=\"manifest%20destiny\"&gt;manifest destiny&lt;/a&gt;' was.\"\nFounding Fathers of the United States.\nOn July 4, 1776, immediately after the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt; was officially passed, the &lt;a href=\"Continental%20Congress\"&gt;Continental Congress&lt;/a&gt; asked &lt;a href=\"John%20Adams\"&gt;John Adams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Jefferson\"&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Franklin\"&gt;Benjamin Franklin&lt;/a&gt; to design a seal that would clearly represent a symbol for the new United States. They chose the symbol of Moses leading the Israelites to freedom. \nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"George%20Washington\"&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; in 1799, two thirds of his eulogies referred to him as \"America's Moses,\" with one orator saying that \"Washington has been the same to us as Moses was to the Children of Israel.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Franklin\"&gt;Benjamin Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, in 1788, saw the difficulties that some of the newly independent &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;American states&lt;/a&gt; were having in forming a government, and proposed that until a new code of laws could be agreed to, they should be governed by \"the laws of Moses,\" as contained in the Old Testament. He justified his proposal by explaining that the laws had worked in biblical times: \"The &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Being\"&gt;Supreme Being&lt;/a&gt;\u2026 having rescued them from bondage by many miracles, performed by his servant Moses, he personally delivered to that chosen servant, in the presence of the whole nation, a constitution and code of laws for their observance.\n&lt;a href=\"John%20Adams\"&gt;John Adams&lt;/a&gt;, 2nd &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, stated why he relied on the laws of Moses over &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek%20philosophy\"&gt;Greek philosophy&lt;/a&gt; for establishing the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;United States Constitution&lt;/a&gt;: \"As much as I love, esteem, and admire the Greeks, I believe the Hebrews have done more to enlighten and civilize the world. Moses did more than all their legislators and philosophers.\" Swedish historian &lt;a href=\"Hugo%20Valentin\"&gt;Hugo Valentin&lt;/a&gt; credited Moses as the \"first to proclaim the &lt;a href=\"Human%20rights\"&gt;rights of man&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSlavery and civil rights.\n&lt;a href=\"Underground%20Railroad\"&gt;Underground Railroad&lt;/a&gt; conductor and &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; veteran &lt;a href=\"Harriet%20Tubman\"&gt;Harriet Tubman&lt;/a&gt; was nicknamed \"Moses\" due to her various missions in freeing and ferrying escaped enslaved persons to freedom in the free states of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistorian Gladys L. Knight describes how leaders who emerged during and after the period in which &lt;a href=\"slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;slavery in the United States&lt;/a&gt; was legal often personified the Moses symbol. \"The symbol of Moses was empowering in that it served to amplify a need for freedom.\" Therefore, when &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Lincoln\"&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln\"&gt;assassinated in 1865&lt;/a&gt; after the passage of the &lt;a href=\"Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;amendment to the Constitution outlawing slavery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"African%20Americans\"&gt;Black Americans&lt;/a&gt; said they had lost \"their Moses\". Lincoln biographer &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Carleton%20Coffin\"&gt;Charles Carleton Coffin&lt;/a&gt; writes, \"The millions whom Abraham Lincoln delivered from slavery will ever liken him to Moses, the deliverer of Israel.\" Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Harriet%20Tubman\"&gt;Harriet Tubman&lt;/a&gt;, who rescued approximately seventy enslaved family and friends, was also described as the \"Moses\" of her people.\nIn the 1960s, a leading figure in the &lt;a href=\"civil%20rights%20movement\"&gt;civil rights movement&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.\"&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, who was called \"a modern Moses,\" and often referred to Moses in his speeches: \"The struggle of Moses, the struggle of his devoted followers as they sought to get out of Egypt. This is something of the story of every people struggling for freedom.\"\nCultural portrayals and references.\nArt.\nMoses often appears in Christian art, and the Pope's private chapel, the &lt;a href=\"Sistine%20Chapel\"&gt;Sistine Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, has a &lt;a href=\"Sistine%20Chapel%23Southern%20wall\"&gt;large sequence of six fresco&lt;/a&gt;s of the \"life of Moses\" on the southern wall, opposite a set with the \"life of Christ\". They were painted in 1481-82 by a group of mostly Florentine artists including &lt;a href=\"Sandro%20Botticelli\"&gt;Sandro Botticelli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Perugino\"&gt;Pietro Perugino&lt;/a&gt;. Because of an ambiguity in &lt;a href=\"Jerome\"&gt;Jerome&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Latin%20Vulgate\"&gt;Latin Vulgate&lt;/a&gt; translation of the Bible, where Moses's face is described as \"cornutam\" (meaning either \"shining\" or \"horned\") when descending from Mount Sinai with the tablets, Moses is usually shown in Western art until the Renaissance with small horns, which at least served as a convenient identifying attribute.\nWith the prophet &lt;a href=\"Elijah\"&gt;Elijah&lt;/a&gt;, he is a necessary figure in the &lt;a href=\"Transfiguration%20of%20Jesus%20in%20Christian%20art\"&gt;Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art&lt;/a&gt;, a subject with a long history in Eastern Orthodox art, and popular in Western art between about 1475 and 1535.\n&lt;a href=\"Michelangelo\"&gt;Michelangelo&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Moses%20%28Michelangelo%29\"&gt;statue of Moses&lt;/a&gt; (1513\u201315), in the Church of &lt;a href=\"San%20Pietro%20in%20Vincoli\"&gt;San Pietro in Vincoli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the most familiar statues in the world. The horns the sculptor included on Moses's head are the result of a mistranslation of the Hebrew Bible into the Latin &lt;a href=\"Vulgate\"&gt;Vulgate Bible&lt;/a&gt; with which Michelangelo was familiar. The Hebrew word taken from \"Exodus\" means either a \"horn\" or an \"irradiation.\" Experts at the &lt;a href=\"Archaeological%20Institute%20of%20America\"&gt;Archaeological Institute of America&lt;/a&gt; show that the term was used when Moses \"returned to his people after seeing as much of the Glory of the Lord as human eye could stand,\" and his face \"reflected radiance.\" In early &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20culture%23Visual%20arts%20and%20architecture\"&gt;Jewish art&lt;/a&gt;, moreover, Moses is often \"shown with rays coming out of his head.\"\nMoses is depicted in several U.S. government buildings because of his legacy as a lawgiver. In the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Congress\"&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt; stands a large statue of Moses alongside a statue of the &lt;a href=\"Paul%20the%20Apostle\"&gt;Paul the Apostle&lt;/a&gt;. Moses is one of the 23 lawgivers depicted in &lt;a href=\"marble\"&gt;marble&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bas-relief\"&gt;bas-relief&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Capitol%23House%20Chamber\"&gt;chamber&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Capitol\"&gt;United States Capitol&lt;/a&gt;. The plaque's overview states: \"Moses (c.\u00a01350\u20131250\u00a0B.C.) Hebrew prophet and lawgiver; transformed a wandering people into a nation; received the Ten Commandments.\"\nThe other twenty-two figures have their profiles turned to Moses, which is the only forward-facing bas-relief.\nMoses appears eight times in carvings that ring the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Supreme%20Court%20Building\"&gt;Supreme Court Great Hall&lt;/a&gt; ceiling. His face is presented along with other ancient figures such as &lt;a href=\"Solomon\"&gt;Solomon&lt;/a&gt;, the Greek god &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and the Roman goddess of wisdom, &lt;a href=\"Minerva\"&gt;Minerva&lt;/a&gt;. The Supreme Court Building's east pediment depicts Moses holding two tablets. Tablets representing the Ten Commandments can be found carved in the oak courtroom doors, on the support frame of the courtroom's bronze gates and in the library woodwork. A controversial image is one that sits directly above the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Chief Justice of the United States&lt;/a&gt;' head. In the center of the 40-foot-long Spanish marble carving is a tablet displaying &lt;a href=\"Roman%20numerals\"&gt;Roman numerals&lt;/a&gt; I through X, with some numbers partially hidden.\nCriticism of Moses.\nIn the late eighteenth century, the deist &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Paine\"&gt;Thomas Paine&lt;/a&gt; commented at length on Moses's Laws in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Age%20of%20Reason\"&gt;The Age of Reason&lt;/a&gt;\" (1794, 1795, and 1807). Paine considered Moses to be a \"detestable &lt;a href=\"villain\"&gt;villain&lt;/a&gt;\", and cited Numbers 31 as an example of his \"unexampled atrocities\". In the passage, after the Israelite army returned from &lt;a href=\"Midian%20war\"&gt;conquering Midian&lt;/a&gt;, Moses orders the killing of the Midianites with the exception of the virgin girls who were to be kept for the Israelites.\nRabbi Joel Grossman argued that the story is a \"powerful &lt;a href=\"fable\"&gt;fable&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"lust\"&gt;lust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"betrayal\"&gt;betrayal&lt;/a&gt;\", and that Moses's execution of the women was a symbolic condemnation of those who seek to turn sex and desire to evil purposes. He says that the Middianite women \"used their sexual attractiveness to turn the Israelite men away from [Yahweh] God and toward the worship of Baal Peor [another Canaanite God]\". Rabbi Grossman argues that the genocide of all the Middianite non-virgin women, including those that did not seduce Jewish men, was fair because some of them had sex for \"improper reasons\". Alan Levin, an educational specialist with the &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Judaism\"&gt;Reform&lt;/a&gt; movement, has similarly suggested that the story should be taken as a &lt;a href=\"cautionary%20tale\"&gt;cautionary tale&lt;/a&gt;, to \"warn successive generations of Jews to watch their own idolatrous behavior\". &lt;a href=\"Moses%20Sofer\"&gt;Chasam Sofer&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes that this war was not fought at Moses's behest, but was commanded by God as an act of revenge against the Midianite women, who, according to the Biblical account, had seduced the Israelites and led them to sin.\nMoses has also been the subject of much feminist criticism. &lt;a href=\"Womanist%20theology\"&gt;Womanist Biblical&lt;/a&gt; scholar &lt;a href=\"Nyasha%20Junior\"&gt;Nyasha Junior&lt;/a&gt; has argued that Moses can be the object of feminist inquiry."
