    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Ace%20Books\"&gt;Ace Books&lt;/a&gt; published 250 &lt;a href=\"western%20%28genre%29\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; Ace doubles between 1952 and 1973 in &lt;a href=\"Dos-%C3%A0-dos%20binding\"&gt;dos-\u00e0-dos&lt;/a&gt; format.\nGenres and collectability.\nAce published &lt;a href=\"science%20fiction\"&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mystery%20fiction\"&gt;mysteries&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"western%20%28genre%29\"&gt;westerns&lt;/a&gt;, as well as books not in any of these &lt;a href=\"literary%20genre\"&gt;genres&lt;/a&gt;. Collectors of these genres have found the Ace doubles an attractive set of books to collect, because of the unusual appearance of the &lt;a href=\"dos-%C3%A0-dos%20binding\"&gt;dos-\u00e0-dos&lt;/a&gt; format.\nThe list given here gives a date of publication; in all cases this refers to the date of publication by Ace, and not the date of original publication of the novels. For more information about the history of these titles, see &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Books\"&gt;Ace Books&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a discussion of the serial numbering conventions used and an explanation of the letter-code system."
