    "text": "Charles Edward Locke (May 5, 1932 \u2013 January 9, 2015) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; player. Locke was a right-handed &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; who appeared in two &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Orioles\"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;, and although he allowed no &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; in three total &lt;a href=\"inning%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;innings&lt;/a&gt; of work as a &lt;a href=\"relief%20pitcher\"&gt;reliever&lt;/a&gt;, he never again pitched in the Majors.\nLocke, who stood tall and weighed , spent nine years (1950\u20131958) in professional baseball; all but four games were played in the Baltimore organization. He signed with the franchise in 1950 when it was still the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Browns\"&gt;St. Louis Browns&lt;/a&gt; and was recalled by the Orioles in 1955 after he won 18 games for the &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20Missions\"&gt;San Antonio Missions&lt;/a&gt; of the Double-A &lt;a href=\"Texas%20League\"&gt;Texas League&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his MLB debut, at &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Baltimore%29\"&gt;Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt;, he came into the game in the eighth inning with Baltimore trailing, 7\u20134. Locke allowed one baserunner, on an &lt;a href=\"error%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;error&lt;/a&gt;, but got out of the inning unscathed when &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Yost\"&gt;Eddie Yost&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Batted%20ball\"&gt;fly ball&lt;/a&gt; resulted in a 9\u20136\u20135 &lt;a href=\"double%20play\"&gt;double play&lt;/a&gt;. He left for a &lt;a href=\"pinch%20hitter\"&gt;pinch hitter&lt;/a&gt; in the bottom of the eighth, when the Orioles rallied to tie the game \u2014 which they went on to win, 8\u20137.\nIn his second and final appearance a week later, also against the Senators (but at &lt;a href=\"Griffith%20Stadium\"&gt;Griffith Stadium&lt;/a&gt;), Locke pitched the last two innings of a 7\u20133 Oriole defeat. He retired Washington in order in the seventh, and in the eighth recorded his only Major League &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt; (Yost) and &lt;a href=\"base%20on%20balls\"&gt;base on balls&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Valdivielso\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Valdivielso&lt;/a&gt;).\nLocke returned to &lt;a href=\"minor%20league%20baseball\"&gt;minor league baseball&lt;/a&gt; in 1956 and retired after the 1958 season after 274 minor league games and an 82\u201397 &lt;a href=\"Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29\"&gt;won\u2013lost record&lt;/a&gt;."
