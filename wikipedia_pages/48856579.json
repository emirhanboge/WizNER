    "text": "Myddelton Square, the largest square in &lt;a href=\"Central%20London\"&gt;Central London&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Clerkenwell\"&gt;Clerkenwell&lt;/a&gt;, is a residential public &lt;a href=\"garden%20square\"&gt;garden square&lt;/a&gt; of the 1820s to 1840s, with playground, with many trees; its houses are built with exposed brickwork, &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20architecture\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt; style, with high-ceilinged ground and first-floor storeys. Two of its houses were obliterated and rebuilt, and two declared unsafe and rebuilt, due to the &lt;a href=\"London%20Blitz\"&gt;London Blitz&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternally, with roads and pavements, it spans , as measures by from one set of houses fronting, to another.\nArchitecture.\nIt was laid out by &lt;a href=\"William%20Chadwell%20Mylne\"&gt;William Chadwell Mylne&lt;/a&gt;. It still presents as a set of 73 large townhouses of its original style but many have been internally subdivided. The houses were firstly built by 13 building firms, then that chosen in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; for 11A and 12A on the south side, plus another commissioned from the &lt;a href=\"London%20Blitz\"&gt;London Blitz&lt;/a&gt;-related reconstruction of two north-side houses. All are constructed in a &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20architecture\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt; style of \"yellow\" stock brick (often now slightly darkened) in Flemish bond and a white banded, stuccoed, to resemble stone-built, ground floor, and save for those stated as replacements, from 1822 to 1843. \nThe square has &lt;a href=\"St%20Mark%27s%20Church%2C%20Myddelton%20Square\"&gt;St Mark's&lt;/a&gt; fronting the street on the west side of its garden.\nAll of the houses are &lt;a href=\"Grade%20II%20listed\"&gt;Grade II listed&lt;/a&gt;, as is the church (protected and recognised in the initial, mainstream statutory category).\nThe square is named after &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Myddelton\"&gt;Sir Hugh Myddelton&lt;/a&gt; (1560\u20131631), the founder of the &lt;a href=\"New%20River%20Company\"&gt;New River Company&lt;/a&gt;, whose family sold the land on which it was built, drawing a profit by way of overseeing and granting building leases, meaning the upmarket builders shouldered the risk, when built up in later years.\nLayout.\nThree main approach ways, the broadest being east, are added to by Myddleton Passage, which removed \u2116s\u00a03 and 4 (access to two apartment blocks and their landscaped grounds), but an earlier access to the same side was filled in to become new houses, in the same style, 11A and 12A.\nNotable residents.\nThe dramatist, actor and theatre manager, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20John%20Dibdin\"&gt;Thomas John Dibdin&lt;/a&gt; (1771\u20131841) was of the first residents, as to \u2116\u00a07 in 1826-27.\nEvents.\n\u2116s\u00a043\u201353 on the north side became rubble from bombing, mentioned above, on 11 January 1941. They were rebuilt by the New River Company in 1947 and 1948 which took government compensation, the frontages differ by having full-height brickwork, no ground floor stone-like dressings, of the others. \u2116s\u00a03 and 4 were demolished as lesser-damaged by the same bombing campaign.\nDrama set.\nA BBC adaptation of \"&lt;a href=\"Howards%20End\"&gt;Howards End&lt;/a&gt;\", by &lt;a href=\"EM%20Forster\"&gt;EM Forster&lt;/a&gt;, in 2017 used a house as the London home of the central Schlegel family (suggestive of fictional \"Wickham Place\").\nFurther reading.\nPer the Historic England, statutory, listing:"
