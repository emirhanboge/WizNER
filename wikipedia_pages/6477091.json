    "text": "Rex Peers \"Moose\" Mossop (18 February 1928 \u2013 17 June 2011) was an Australian &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; footballer who played in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s \u2013 a dual-code international, and an Australian television personality from 1964 until 1991.\nRugby union career.\nMossop played rugby union for the &lt;a href=\"Manly%20RUFC\"&gt;Manly club&lt;/a&gt; and played eight tests for the &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Wallabies&lt;/a&gt; from 1948 to 1951. His international rugby union career was played at &lt;a href=\"Lock%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt;. In 1950 he was chosen in the All-Australian team for that season selected by the magazine Sporting Life.\nRugby league career.\nSwitching to rugby league in England in 1951, he played with &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20League%20Championship\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Leigh%20Centurions\"&gt;Leigh&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to Australia and Sydney's &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Beaches\"&gt;Northern Beaches&lt;/a&gt; in 1956, joining the &lt;a href=\"Manly-Warringah%20Sea%20Eagles\"&gt;Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles&lt;/a&gt; who played in the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;New South Wales Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; Premiership and became the cornerstone of their &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20positions%23Forwards\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt; pack in the late 1950s.\nEver an aggressive &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20positions%23The%20front%20row\"&gt;front-row forward&lt;/a&gt;, Mossop played in the Manly sides that lost to the &lt;a href=\"St%20George%20Dragons\"&gt;St George Dragons&lt;/a&gt; in grand finals in &lt;a href=\"1957%20NSWRFL%20season%23Grand%20Final\"&gt;1957&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1959%20NSWRFL%20season%23Grand%20Final\"&gt;1959&lt;/a&gt;. In the lead up to the 1959 Grand Final, rumours were circulating that Mossop was carrying a broken cheekbone. From the kick off, Saints' forwards took turns at testing Mossop's injury with opposing prop &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Bath\"&gt;Harry Bath&lt;/a&gt; giving him particular attention. For most of the match the Manly forward copped a hammering until in frustration, Mossop retaliated by standing on Bath's head. A brawl broke out between the two and the referee &lt;a href=\"Darcy%20Lawler\"&gt;Darcy Lawler&lt;/a&gt; sent both off. Mossop later recalled how after both he and Bath had left the league judiciary the following week, that they got talking and both got a laugh about being told off like naughty school boys. A mutual respect for each other had developed into what would be a lifelong friendship between the pair.\nNotwithstanding his uncompromising playing style, Mossop won a newspaper's \"best and fairest\" award for the &lt;a href=\"1958%20NSWRFL%20season\"&gt;1958 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe first represented &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Kangaroos\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in rugby league at age 30 in 1958 in the first Test against the &lt;a href=\"1958%20Great%20Britain%20Lions%20tour\"&gt;touring&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20Lions\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; side at the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Sydney Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt;, an appearance in which he became Australia's 25th dual code rugby international, following &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Kearney\"&gt;Ken Kearney&lt;/a&gt; (a teammate that day playing hooker) and preceding &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Summons\"&gt;Arthur Summons&lt;/a&gt;. He scored a try on d\u00e9but as the Australian's defeated the tourists 25\u20138. Mossop then played in the remaining &lt;a href=\"The%20Ashes%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Ashes Tests&lt;/a&gt; though the Lions would go on to win the remaining games and the series 2\u20131. He then toured with the Kangaroos to Great Britain in 1959-60 as vice-captain. Mossop played a total of nine Tests for Australia.\nIn 1959 Mossop played in the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; loss to &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20Maroons\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; that attracted 35,261 spectators to the &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20Exhibition%20Ground\"&gt;Brisbane Exhibition Ground&lt;/a&gt;, smashing Brisbane's previous record for an interstate match of 22,817. Queensland won the game 17\u201315.\nHe played 136 games for Manly, retiring in 1963 at age 35.\nRex Mossop is listed on the Australian Rugby League Players Register as Kangaroo No. 336.\nCommentator.\nAs was normal for professional rugby league players of the time, Mossop had a full-time job: as a &lt;a href=\"Automobile%20salesperson\"&gt;car salesman&lt;/a&gt; for one of Sydney's largest car dealers, Stacks Holden. In 1963 he heard that &lt;a href=\"ATN\"&gt;Channel 7&lt;/a&gt; were advertising for a Sports Director. Despite not having any television or broadcasting experience, Mossop won the position over sixty applicants for the job, many of whom possessed better television credentials than he did.\nMossop first appeared on air in 1964 and called his first game in 1965, only four years after former player &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Stehr\"&gt;Ray Stehr&lt;/a&gt; had carried out the first ever commercial telecast on &lt;a href=\"TCN\"&gt;Channel 9&lt;/a&gt; in 1961. He spent 20 years as host of a rugby league preview show including the &lt;a href=\"Controversy%20Corner%23Segments\"&gt;Controversy Corner&lt;/a&gt; discussion segment. From the early 1970s till 1990 on Sydney channels Seven and then &lt;a href=\"TEN%20%28TV%20station%29\"&gt;Ten&lt;/a&gt; he was the voice of rugby league and the pre-eminent TV match broadcast caller. His criticism of players and referees was blunt and uncompromising and his calling style was seen by opposing fans as parochially favouring Manly. His match commentaries and indeed his other forays into the public domain were often filled with tautological descriptors that in eastern state Australian vernacular became known as \"Mossopisms\": These mistakes also led to his nickname, \"Rox Messup\".\nHe also recorded such classics as:\nThe perceived &lt;a href=\"parochialism\"&gt;parochialism&lt;/a&gt; towards Manly - and a gruff style that bordered on arrogance - often alienated him with league supporters, so much so that he was once famously hit in the side of the head with a piece of fruit thrown at him while giving a live post-match summary. With his long association with Channel 7 many celebrities and media still refer to ATN Channel 7 as Channel REX.\nAs a commentator, Mossop also covered the &lt;a href=\"1978%20Kangaroo%20tour\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1982%20Kangaroo%20tour\"&gt;1982&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1986%20Kangaroo%20tour\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt; Kangaroo Tours for Australian television. Never one to hold back his comments, when describing the Australians 34-4 demolition of Great Britain in the second test at &lt;a href=\"Elland%20Road\"&gt;Elland Road&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; during the undefeated 1986 tour, Mossop said as &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Kenny\"&gt;Brett Kenny&lt;/a&gt; crossed for the Kangaroos 6th try (pushing the score at that stage to 32-0) \"\"Australia carved them up. They've decimated, dissected and absolutely diabolically destroyed this Great Britain side today\"'.\"\nThrough his work with Channel 7 during the 1960s, Mossop also became a commentator at the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Showground%20Speedway\"&gt;Sydney Showground Speedway&lt;/a&gt; during the summer months. He would also commentate on other &lt;a href=\"Dirt%20track%20racing\"&gt;speedway&lt;/a&gt; events during his career including working with ATN's motorsports director and &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20Speedway\"&gt;Liverpool City Raceway&lt;/a&gt; promoter Mike Raymond on televised events from Liverpool such as the &lt;a href=\"1982%20Speedway%20World%20Pairs%20Championship\"&gt;1982 Speedway World Pairs Championship&lt;/a&gt; Final.\nOther television work.\nFrom 1970 to 1971, Mossop was the \"Beast\" on the television talk show \"&lt;a href=\"Beauty%20and%20the%20Beast%20%28talk%20show%29\"&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFrom 1991 to 1995, he was a regular panel member on &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Denton\"&gt;Andrew Denton&lt;/a&gt;'s sport-themed comedy talk show, \"&lt;a href=\"Live%20and%20Sweaty\"&gt;Live and Sweaty&lt;/a&gt;\", on the &lt;a href=\"ABC%20%28Australian%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; alongside others including actor &lt;a href=\"Lex%20Marinos\"&gt;Lex \"The Swine\" Marinos&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"Australian%20rules%20football\"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt;er &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Keenan\"&gt;Peter \"Crackers\" Keenan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Tighe\"&gt;Karen Tighe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Debbie%20Spillane\"&gt;Debbie \"Skull of Rust\" Spillane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elle%20McFeast\"&gt;Elle McFeast&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Libbi%20Gorr\"&gt;Libbi Gorr&lt;/a&gt;).\nHonours.\nMossop became a life member of the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;New South Wales Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; (NSWRL) in 1999 in recognition of services to the game.\nIn 2006, Mossop was named in both the Manly Rugby League and Manly Rugby Union \"best ever\" sides, highlighting his enormous contribution to both codes.\nRex Mossop was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Sports%20Medal\"&gt;Australian Sports Medal&lt;/a&gt; on 24 October 2000 for services to Rugby League.\nPersonal.\nMossop was the younger son of Norman, a &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; veteran who had been wounded in battle at &lt;a href=\"Passchendale\"&gt;Passchendale&lt;/a&gt;, and Nellie Mossop (n\u00e9e Kirkpatrick). Born in &lt;a href=\"Five%20Dock%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Five Dock, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, he had an elder brother, Kirk, who later became a noted artist. The family lived in Five Dock but moved to &lt;a href=\"Balgowlah\"&gt;Balgowlah&lt;/a&gt; by the time he was five. He attended &lt;a href=\"Manly%20Selective%20Campus\"&gt;Manly Boys High School&lt;/a&gt;, leaving in 1943 to become initially an apprentice &lt;a href=\"fitter%20and%20turner\"&gt;fitter and turner&lt;/a&gt;, and later a sales representative for a variety of businesses prior to his career in television.\nMossop married Joan Mildred Bell on 26 October 1951 at St Matthew's Church, Manly. The couple had two sons, Kirk (1952) and Gregory (1956).\nIn 1976, Mossop made a &lt;a href=\"citizen%27s%20arrest\"&gt;citizen's arrest&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Naturism\"&gt;nudist&lt;/a&gt; at Balgowlah Beach later stating \"I don't need the male genitalia rammed down my throat\".\nIn his final years, Mossop suffered from &lt;a href=\"Alzheimer%27s%20disease\"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. He died aged 83 on 17 June 2011 at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20North%20Shore%20Hospital\"&gt;Royal North Shore Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney surrounded by family and friends. His funeral was held on 24 June 2011 at St Matthews Church, Manly.\nAs a mark of respect for Mossop, the Manly Sea Eagles players wore black armbands for their Round 15 clash with traditional rivals &lt;a href=\"Parramatta%20Eels\"&gt;Parramatta&lt;/a&gt; on 20 June 2011 at Manly's home ground, &lt;a href=\"Brookvale%20Oval\"&gt;Brookvale Oval&lt;/a&gt;, and a minute's silence was observed before kick off."
