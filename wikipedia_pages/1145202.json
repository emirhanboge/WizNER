    "text": "Brunhilda (c. 543\u2013613) was &lt;a href=\"queen%20consort\"&gt;queen consort&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Austrasia\"&gt;Austrasia&lt;/a&gt;, part of &lt;a href=\"Francia\"&gt;Francia&lt;/a&gt;, by marriage to the &lt;a href=\"Merovingian\"&gt;Merovingian&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Sigebert%20I\"&gt;Sigebert I of Austrasia&lt;/a&gt;, and regent for her son, grandson and great-grandson.\nIn her long and complicated career she ruled the eastern Frankish kingdoms of Austrasia and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;Burgundy&lt;/a&gt; for three periods as &lt;a href=\"regent\"&gt;regent&lt;/a&gt; for her son &lt;a href=\"Childebert%20II\"&gt;Childebert II&lt;/a&gt; from 575 until 583; her grandsons &lt;a href=\"Theudebert%20II\"&gt;Theudebert II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theuderic%20II\"&gt;Theuderic II&lt;/a&gt; from 595 until 599; and her great-grandson &lt;a href=\"Sigebert%20II\"&gt;Sigebert II&lt;/a&gt; in 613. The period was marked by tension between the royal house and the powerful nobles vying for power.\nBrunhilda was apparently an efficient ruler, but this and her forceful personality brought her into conflict with her nobles, the church and the other Merovingians. Her bitter feud with &lt;a href=\"Fredegund\"&gt;Fredegund&lt;/a&gt;, mistress of &lt;a href=\"Chilperic%20I\"&gt;Chilperic I&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Neustria\"&gt;Neustria&lt;/a&gt;, who murdered Brunhilda's sister, Queen &lt;a href=\"Galswintha\"&gt;Galswintha&lt;/a&gt; (c. 568) in order to replace her as queen, lasted until Fredegund's death in 597. Fredegund had Brunhilda's husband murdered and Brunhilda imprisoned for a period. This feud was continued by Fredegund's son, &lt;a href=\"Chlothar%20II\"&gt;Chlothar II&lt;/a&gt;, who in 613 defeated Brunhilda in battle and had her &lt;a href=\"Dismemberment%23By%20four%20horses\"&gt;executed by being pulled apart by four horses&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nBrunhilda was possibly born about 543 in the &lt;a href=\"Visigothic%20Spain\"&gt;Visigothic&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;, the younger of the two daughters of &lt;a href=\"Athanagild\"&gt;Athanagild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goiswintha\"&gt;Goiswintha&lt;/a&gt;. She was only eleven years old when her father was made king in 554. She was educated in Toledo as an &lt;a href=\"Arian%20Christian\"&gt;Arian Christian&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst marriage.\nIn 567, she was married to King &lt;a href=\"Sigebert%20I\"&gt;Sigebert I&lt;/a&gt; of Austrasia, a grandson of &lt;a href=\"Clovis%20I\"&gt;Clovis I&lt;/a&gt;, who had sent an embassy to Toledo loaded with gifts. She joined him at &lt;a href=\"Metz\"&gt;Metz&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their marriage, she converted to &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism\"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;.\nSigebert's father, &lt;a href=\"Chlothar%20I\"&gt;Chlothar I&lt;/a&gt;, had reunited the four kingdoms of the Franks, but when he died, Sigebert and his three brothers divided them again. According to historian and bishop &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20of%20Tours\"&gt;Gregory of Tours&lt;/a&gt;, Sigebert's marriage to a Visigothic princess was a criticism of his brothers' choices in wives. Instead of marrying a low-born woman, Sigebert chose a princess of education and morals.\nIn response to Sigebert's noble marriage, his brother, Chilperic I of Neustria, sent for Brunhilda's sister, &lt;a href=\"Galswintha\"&gt;Galswintha&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20of%20Tours\"&gt;Gregory of Tours&lt;/a&gt; suggests that he proposed because he envied his brother's marriage to Brunhilda; however, Galswintha ordered him to purge his court of &lt;a href=\"courtesan\"&gt;courtesan&lt;/a&gt;s and mistresses and he soon grew tired of her. He and his favorite mistress, Fredegund, conspired to murder her. An unknown assailant strangled Galswintha while she slept in her bed and Chilperic married Fredegund.\nBrunhilda so detested Fredegund for the death of her sister\u2014and this hatred was so fiercely reciprocated\u2014that the two queens persuaded their husbands to go to war. Sigebert persuaded their other brother, the elder &lt;a href=\"Guntram\"&gt;Guntram&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;, to mediate the dispute between the queens. He decided that Galswintha's &lt;a href=\"dower\"&gt;dower&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Limoges\"&gt;Limoges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cahors\"&gt;Cahors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9arn\"&gt;B\u00e9arn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bigorre\"&gt;Bigorre&lt;/a&gt; should be turned over to Brunhilda in restitution. However, Chilperic did not easily give up the cities and Brunhilda did not forget the murder. Bishop &lt;a href=\"Germain%20of%20Paris\"&gt;Germain of Paris&lt;/a&gt; negotiated a brief peace between them.\nBetween 567 and 570, Brunhilda bore Sigebert three children: &lt;a href=\"Ingund%20%28wife%20of%20Hermenegild%29\"&gt;Ingund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chlodosinda%20%28daughter%20of%20Sigebert%20I%29\"&gt;Chlodosind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Childebert%20II\"&gt;Childebert&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe peace was then broken by Chilperic, who invaded Sigebert's dominions. Sigebert defeated Chilperic, who fled to &lt;a href=\"Tournai\"&gt;Tournai&lt;/a&gt;. The people of Paris hailed Sigebert as a conqueror when he arrived with Brunhilda and their children. Bishop Germain wrote to Brunhilda, asking her to persuade her husband to restore the peace and to spare his brother. Chroniclers of his life say that she ignored this; certainly Sigebert set out to besiege Tournai. Fredegund responded to this threat to her husband by hiring two assassins, who killed Sigebert at &lt;a href=\"Vitry-en-Artois\"&gt;Vitry-en-Artois&lt;/a&gt; with poisoned daggers (&lt;a href=\"seax\"&gt;scramsaxi&lt;/a&gt;, according to Gregory). Brunhilda was captured and imprisoned at &lt;a href=\"Rouen\"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond marriage.\nMerovech, the son of Chilperic and his first wife &lt;a href=\"Audovera\"&gt;Audovera&lt;/a&gt;, went to &lt;a href=\"Rouen\"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt; on pretext of visiting his mother. While there, he decided to marry the widowed Brunhilda and thus strengthen his chances of becoming a king. His stepmother, Fredegund, was determined that only her sons should succeed as kings and eliminated her husband's sons by other women. Merovech and Brunhilda were married by the Bishop of Rouen, &lt;a href=\"Pr%C3%A6textatus%20%28Bishop%20of%20Rouen%29\"&gt;Praetextatus&lt;/a&gt;. However, since Brunhilda was Merovech's aunt the marriage was contrary to canon law.\nChilperic soon besieged them in the church of St Martin on the walls. Eventually he made peace with them, but he took Merovech away with him to Soissons. In an effort to nullify the marriage, Chilperic had Merovech &lt;a href=\"tonsure\"&gt;tonsure&lt;/a&gt;d and sent to the monastery of &lt;a href=\"Le%20Mans\"&gt;Le Mans&lt;/a&gt; to become a priest. Merovech fled to the sanctuary of St Martin at Tours, which was Gregory's church (who was thus an eyewitness to these events), and later to &lt;a href=\"Champagne%20%28historical%20province%29\"&gt;Champagne&lt;/a&gt;. He finally returned to Tours in 578 and when his bid for power failed, he asked his servant to kill him.\nFirst regency.\nBrunhilda now tried to seize the regency of Austrasia in the name of her son &lt;a href=\"Childebert%20II\"&gt;Childebert II&lt;/a&gt;, but she was resisted fiercely by her nobles and had to retire briefly to the court of Guntram of Burgundy before obtaining her goal. At that time, she ruled Austrasia as regent. Not being a fighter, she was primarily an administrative reformer, with a Visigothic education. She repaired the old Roman roads, built many churches and abbeys, constructed the necessary fortresses, reorganised the royal finances, and restructured the royal army. However, she antagonised the nobles by her continued imposition of royal authority wherever it was lax. To reinforce her positions and the crown's prestige and power, she convinced Guntram, newly heirless, to adopt Childebert as his own son and heir. This he did in 577. In 579, she married her daughter &lt;a href=\"Ingund%20%28wife%20of%20Hermenegild%29\"&gt;Ingund&lt;/a&gt;a, then only thirteen, to the Visigothic prince &lt;a href=\"Hermenegild\"&gt;Hermenegild&lt;/a&gt;, allying her house to that of the king of her native land. However, Hermenegild converted to Catholicism and he and his wife both died in the ensuing religious wars which tore apart the Visigothic kingdom in Spain.\nBrunhilda ruled Austrasia until Childebert came of age in 583, at the traditional Merovingian majority of thirteen.\nRelations with King Guntram.\nThe conflict with Fredegund flared up once more upon the death of Chilperic. Now in the regency in Neustria, Fredegund was in a position to renew the war with her old enemy. Simultaneously, Brunhilda had to deal with her own internal enemies.\nMany of the dukes strongly opposed her influence over her son Childebert, the king. Three of them\u2014Rauching, Ursio and Berthefrid\u2014conspired to assassinate Childebert; however, their plot was found out. Rauching was killed and Ursio and Berthefrid fled to a fortress. Upon this, Guntram immediately begged for Childebert, Brunhilda and Childebert's two sons to take refuge at his court. This they did and soon Ursio and Berthefrid were killed. In 587, Guntram, Childebert and Brunhilda settled the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Andelot\"&gt;Pact of Andelot&lt;/a&gt; securing for Childebert the Burgundian succession and a continuing alliance of the two realms of Austrasia and Burgundy for the rest of Guntram's life.\nIn that same year, King &lt;a href=\"Reccared%20I\"&gt;Reccared I&lt;/a&gt; of the Visigoths sent embassies to both Childebert and Guntram, the former accepting them and consolidating an alliance and the latter refusing to see them. Thus, when Brunhilda and Childebert negotiated a marriage for the king's sister Chlodosind with the king of Spain, it was rejected by Guntram and abandoned. In 592, Guntram died and Childebert, per the treaty, succeeded to his kingdom, immediately making war on &lt;a href=\"Clotaire%20II\"&gt;Clotaire II&lt;/a&gt; of Neustria, Chilperic's son by Fredegund. Under Fredegund's leadership, Brunhilda's troops were routed in the 593 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Droizy\"&gt;Battle of Droizy&lt;/a&gt;. Childebert died in 596 at the age of twenty-six.\nSecond regency.\nUpon Childebert's death, Brunhilda attempted to govern Austrasia and Burgundy in the name of her grandsons &lt;a href=\"Theudebert%20II\"&gt;Theudebert II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theuderic%20II\"&gt;Theuderic II&lt;/a&gt;. Theudebert became king of Austrasia, and Theuderic, king of Burgundy. Though she attributed the death of Childebert to Fredegund, the later died in 597 and the direct conflict between her and Brunhilda ended. Peace would elude the Franks, however, for many years more as the conflict raged between the two queens' descendants.\nIn 599, Brunhilda's elder grandson, Theudebert, at whose court she was staying, exiled her. She was found wandering near &lt;a href=\"Arcis-sur-Aube\"&gt;Arcis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Champagne%20%28region%29\"&gt;Champagne&lt;/a&gt; by a peasant, who brought her to Theuderic. The peasant was rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"bishopric%20of%20Auxerre\"&gt;bishopric of Auxerre&lt;/a&gt;, as the legend goes. Theuderic welcomed her and readily fell under her influence, which was now inclined to vengeance against Theudebert. Soon the brothers were at war.\nIt is at this point that Brunhilda, now in her later fifties and having survived all the previous tribulations, began to display that ruthlessness which led to her especially violent demise. Brunhilda first took Protadius as lover and, desiring to promote him to high office, conspired to have &lt;a href=\"Berthoald\"&gt;Berthoald&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mayor%20of%20the%20palace\"&gt;mayor of the palace&lt;/a&gt;, killed. In 604, she convinced Theuderic to send Berthoald to inspect the royal \"&lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt;e\" along the &lt;a href=\"Seine\"&gt;Seine&lt;/a&gt;. Clotaire, in accordance with Brunhilda's bidding, sent his own mayor &lt;a href=\"Landric\"&gt;Landric&lt;/a&gt; (a former paramour of Fredegund) to meet Berthoald, who had only a small contingent of men with him. Realising that he had been the victim of courtly plotting, Berthoald, in the ensuing confrontation, overchased the enemy until he was surrounded and killed. Protadius was promptly put in his place.\nBrunhilda and Protadius soon persuaded Theuderic to return to war with Theudebert, but the mayor was murdered by his warriors, who did not wish to fight to assuage the ego of the queen. The man who ordered Protadius' execution, Duke &lt;a href=\"Uncelen\"&gt;Uncelen&lt;/a&gt;, was soon arrested by Brunhilda and tortured and executed. He was not the first ducal victim of the queen's vengeance.\nIt was also during these later regencies that &lt;a href=\"Desiderius%20of%20Vienne\"&gt;Desiderius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Vienne\"&gt;Bishop of Vienne&lt;/a&gt; (later Saint Didier), publicly accused her of incest and cruelty. Desiderius finally enraged her with a pointed sermon on chastity preached in 612 before her and Theuderic, with whom she then hired three assassins to murder the bishop at the village now-called &lt;a href=\"Saint-Didier-sur-Chalaronne\"&gt;Saint-Didier-sur-Chalaronne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird regency.\nThe successor of Theuderic II was his son &lt;a href=\"Sigebert%20II\"&gt;Sigebert&lt;/a&gt;, a child. The mayor of the palace of Austrasia, &lt;a href=\"Warnachar\"&gt;Warnachar&lt;/a&gt;, fearing that at his young age he would fall under the influence of his great-grandmother, brought him before a national assembly, where he was proclaimed king by the nobles, who then did homage to him ruling over both his father's kingdoms. Nonetheless, he could not be kept out of the influence of Brunhilda. Thus, for the last time in a long life (now in her seventies), she was regent of the Franks, this time for her own great-grandson.\nBut Warnachar and &lt;a href=\"Rado%20%28mayor%20of%20the%20palace%29\"&gt;Rado&lt;/a&gt;, mayor of the palace of Burgundy, along with &lt;a href=\"Pepin%20of%20Landen\"&gt;Pepin of Landen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arnulf%20of%20Metz\"&gt;Arnulf of Metz&lt;/a&gt;, resentful of her regency, abandoned the cause of Brunhilda over the young king and joined with her old antagonist Clotaire II, promising not to rise in defence of the queen-regent and recognising Clotaire as rightful regent and guardian of Sigebert. Brunhilda, with Sigebert, met Clotaire's army on the &lt;a href=\"Aisne\"&gt;Aisne&lt;/a&gt;, but the dukes yet again betrayed her: the &lt;a href=\"Patrician%20%28post-Roman%20Europe%29\"&gt;Patrician&lt;/a&gt; Aletheus, Duke Rocco and Duke Sigvald deserted her and she and her king had to flee. They fled as far as the city of Orbe (in today French Switzerland), hoping to enlist the aid of certain German tribes, but Clotaire's minions caught up with them by &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Neuch%C3%A2tel\"&gt;Lake Neuch\u00e2tel&lt;/a&gt;. The young king and his brother Corbo were both killed: thus ended the long and bloody feud between Austrasia and Neustria, and, reuniting the two kingdoms, Clotaire held the entire realm of the Franks.\nClotaire then accused Brunhilda of the death of ten kings of the Franks.\nThe identity of the ten kings comes from the Fourth Book of the \"&lt;a href=\"Chronicle%20of%20Fredegar\"&gt;Chronicle of Fredegar&lt;/a&gt;\". It is usually said to include Sigebert I, Chilperic I, Theudebert II, Theuderic II, Sigebert II, Merovech (Chilperic's son), Merovech (Theuderic's son), Corbo (Theuderic's son) and Childebert (Theuderic's son) and the sons of Theudebert, along with many churchmen, including Desiderius. According to the \"&lt;a href=\"Liber%20Historiae%20Francorum\"&gt;Liber Historiae Francorum&lt;/a&gt;\":Then the army of the Franks and Burgundians joined into one, all shouted together that death would be most fitting for the very wicked Brunhilda. Then King Clotaire ordered that she be lifted onto a camel and led through the entire army. Then she was tied to the feet of wild horses and torn apart limb from limb. Finally she died. Her final grave was the fire. Her bones were burnt.\nOne legend has her being dragged by a wild mare down the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20road\"&gt;Roman road&lt;/a&gt; \"La Chauss\u00e9e Brunehaut\" at &lt;a href=\"Abbeville\"&gt;Abbeville&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nBrunhilda was raised as an &lt;a href=\"Arian%20Christian\"&gt;Arian Christian&lt;/a&gt;, but upon her marriage to Sigebert, converted to &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Christianity&lt;/a&gt;. In general, she protected the church and treated &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Gregory%20I\"&gt;Pope Gregory the Great&lt;/a&gt; with great respect. He wrote a series of positive letters to her; in 597 he wrote to her about interdicting &lt;a href=\"Paganism\"&gt;pagan&lt;/a&gt; rites such as &lt;a href=\"tree%20worship\"&gt;tree worship&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20of%20Tours\"&gt;Gregory of Tours&lt;/a&gt; was another favoured cleric; he was a trusted courtier to her and her son from 587 until his death. She also took a keen personal interest in the bishoprics and monasteries within her dominion. This brought her into conflict with &lt;a href=\"Columbanus\"&gt;Columbanus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"abbot\"&gt;abbot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Luxeuil\"&gt;Luxeuil&lt;/a&gt;, whom she eventually exiled to Italy, where he founded &lt;a href=\"Bobbio\"&gt;Bobbio&lt;/a&gt;. Brunhilda also played a role in perpetuating the &lt;a href=\"diocese%20of%20Maurienne\"&gt;diocese of Maurienne&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"suffragan%20bishopric\"&gt;suffragan bishopric&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"archdiocese%20of%20Vienne\"&gt;archdiocese of Vienne&lt;/a&gt;. In 576, Brunhilda's protector, Sigebert's brother Guntram, had founded the new bishopric at &lt;a href=\"Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne\"&gt;Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne&lt;/a&gt;, separating the &lt;a href=\"Maurienne\"&gt;Maurienne&lt;/a&gt; Valley and the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Susa%20Valley\"&gt;Susa Valley&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Diocese\"&gt;Diocese&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Turin\"&gt;Turin&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Turin\"&gt;Bishop of Turin&lt;/a&gt; protested this to Brunhilda for more than twenty years, but even when &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Gregory%20the%20Great\"&gt;Pope Gregory the Great&lt;/a&gt; supported his complaint in 599, Brunhilda dismissed it.\nBrunhilda was buried in the &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20of%20St%20Martin%2C%20Autun\"&gt;abbey of St. Martin&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Autun\"&gt;Autun&lt;/a&gt; that she founded in 602 on the spot where the &lt;a href=\"bishop%20of%20Tours\"&gt;bishop of Tours&lt;/a&gt; had cut down a beech-tree that served as an object of pagan worship. The abbey was destroyed in 1793 and two parts of the cover of Brunhilda's &lt;a href=\"sarcophagus\"&gt;sarcophagus&lt;/a&gt; are now in the &lt;a href=\"Mus%C3%A9e%20Rolin\"&gt;Mus\u00e9e Rolin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Autun\"&gt;Autun&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrunhilda commissioned the building of several churches and the &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20of%20St%20Vincent%2C%20Laon\"&gt;abbey of St. Vincent&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Laon\"&gt;Laon&lt;/a&gt; (founded in 580). She is also credited with founding the castle of &lt;a href=\"Bruniquel\"&gt;Bruniquel&lt;/a&gt; and having a Roman road resurfaced near &lt;a href=\"Alligny-en-Morvan\"&gt;Alligny-en-Morvan&lt;/a&gt; (where the name of a nearby hill \"Terreau Bruneau\" is believed to be derived from hers). The part of &lt;a href=\"Mauves-sur-Loire\"&gt;Mauves-sur-Loire&lt;/a&gt; known as \"la Fontaine Bruneau\" is named after Brunhilda who may have cooled herself with the fountain's water when she suffered &lt;a href=\"heat%20exhaustion\"&gt;heat exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn legend.\nMany scholars have seen Brunhilda as inspiration for both &lt;a href=\"Brunhild\"&gt;Brunhild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gudrun\"&gt;Kriemhild&lt;/a&gt;, two rival characters from the \"&lt;a href=\"Nibelungenlied\"&gt;Nibelungenlied&lt;/a&gt;\". Kriemhild married &lt;a href=\"Sigurd\"&gt;Siegfried&lt;/a&gt;, who in many respects resembles Sigebert, Brunhilda's husband. There is resemblance between a multitude of characters and events in the Nibelungenlied and those of the latter half of the sixth century in Merovingian Gaul. As Thomas Hodgkin remarks:"
