    "text": "Louis-Ren\u00e9 Madelaine Le Vassor, comte de La Touche-Tr\u00e9ville (3 June 1745 \u2013 19 August 1804) was a French vice-admiral. He fought in the &lt;a href=\"American%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;American War of Independence&lt;/a&gt; and became a prominent figure of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolutionary%20Wars\"&gt;French Revolutionary Wars&lt;/a&gt; and of the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20wars\"&gt;Napoleonic wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorn into a noble family of naval officers, Latouche enlisted at the age of 13. He rose to become a competent frigate captain, battling several British ships during the &lt;a href=\"American%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;American War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. His two-frigate squadron once manoeuvred a 74-gun ship of the line to the point of sinking, and he was entrusted with important personalities of the time as passengers, notably &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XVI%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XVI&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Lafayette\"&gt;Marquis de Lafayette&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Revolution, Latouche, a &lt;a href=\"Freemason\"&gt;Freemason&lt;/a&gt; and aide to &lt;a href=\"Phillipe%20%C3%89galit%C3%A9\"&gt;Phillipe \u00c9galit\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, took progressive positions as a deputy in the &lt;a href=\"Estates%20General%20%28France%29\"&gt;Estates General&lt;/a&gt; and later in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Constituent%20Assembly%20%28France%29\"&gt;National Constituent Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. His nobility nevertheless made him a target during the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Reign of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, and he was imprisoned and only freed from prison by the &lt;a href=\"Thermidorian%20Reaction\"&gt;Thermidorian Reaction&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturned to the Navy after a long period of unemployment, Latouche took command of the &lt;a href=\"Flottille%20de%20Boulogne\"&gt;Flottille de Boulogne&lt;/a&gt;, where he repelled the &lt;a href=\"Raids%20on%20Boulogne\"&gt;Raids on Boulogne&lt;/a&gt; organised by &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Nelson\"&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt;. He then served in the &lt;a href=\"Saint-Domingue%20expedition\"&gt;Saint-Domingue expedition&lt;/a&gt;, which irrevocably compromised his health. After his return, he took command of the fleet in Toulon, reorganising it into a potent tool again, but he succumbed to a relapse of illness before he had a chance to use it. Under his successor &lt;a href=\"Pierre-Charles%20Villeneuve\"&gt;Villeneuve&lt;/a&gt;, the fleet he had refurbished was crushed at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Trafalgar\"&gt;Battle of Trafalgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nLatouche was born in &lt;a href=\"Rochefort-sur-mer\"&gt;Rochefort-sur-mer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charente-Maritime\"&gt;Charente-Maritime&lt;/a&gt;. His father, &lt;a href=\"Louis-Charles%20Le%20Vassor%20de%20La%20Touche\"&gt;Louis-Charles Le Vassor de La Touche&lt;/a&gt;, had been the governor of Martinique, until the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Martinique%20%281762%29\"&gt;Invasion of 1762&lt;/a&gt;, and chief of the naval forces of Rochefort. His uncle, &lt;a href=\"Charles-Auguste%20Levassor%20de%20La%20Touche-Tr%C3%A9ville\"&gt;Charles-Auguste Levassor de La Touche-Tr\u00e9ville&lt;/a&gt;, served as a rear-admiral, commanding the light squadron of the France-Spanish fleet under &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Guillouet%2C%20comte%20d%27Orvilliers\"&gt;Orvilliers&lt;/a&gt; in 1780.\nEarly career.\nAt the age of 13, Latouche joined the &lt;a href=\"Gardes%20de%20la%20Marine\"&gt;Gardes de la Marine&lt;/a&gt;, and took part in numerous naval actions during the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Seven Years' War&lt;/a&gt;. He started sailing on the \"Hardi\", ferrying troops to Canada in 1758, and took part in his first action, in 1759 aboard the 64-gun &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Dragon%20%281748%29\"&gt;\"Dragon\"&lt;/a&gt;, which was under his uncle's command, taking part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Quiberon%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Quiberon Bay&lt;/a&gt;. He also served on the &lt;a href=\"Pram%20%28ship%29\"&gt;pram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Louise%20%281760%29\"&gt;\"Louise\"&lt;/a&gt; and harassed the blockading British squadron &lt;a href=\"%C3%8Ele-d%27Aix\"&gt;\u00cele-d'Aix&lt;/a&gt; in October 1760, still under his uncle. In 1762 he served on the 74-gun &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Intr%C3%A9pide%20%281747%29\"&gt;\"Intr\u00e9pide\"&lt;/a&gt; and on \"&lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Tonnant%20%281740%29\"&gt;Tonnant&lt;/a&gt;\". In the summer of that year, Latouche was detached to command two gunboats with which he attacked two British ships, one 60-gun and one 74-gun, waging a two-hour battle.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281763%29\"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt; in 1763, Latouche took part in training campaigns under his uncle Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville and Admiral &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Hector%2C%20comte%20d%27Estaing\"&gt;d'Estaing&lt;/a&gt;, serving on the ships \"Garonne\" in 1763, and \"Hardi\" and \"Bricole\" in 1765.\nIn September 1768, aged 23, he was promoted to ensign. Perhaps under pressure from his family, who hoped for quicker promotions, or because the reform of the Navy forced him to retire, he resigned from the Navy and enlisted in the Army. He became an aide to Governor-General &lt;a href=\"Victor-Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se%20Charpentier\"&gt;d'Ennery&lt;/a&gt;, newly appointed governor of &lt;a href=\"Martinique\"&gt;Martinique&lt;/a&gt;, who obtained a commission as a cavalry captain for him. In 1771, he transferred as captain to the &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9giment%20de%20La%20Rochefoucauld-Dragons\"&gt;R\u00e9giment de La Rochefoucauld-Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"dragoon\"&gt;dragoon&lt;/a&gt; regiment, and became &lt;a href=\"aide-de-camp\"&gt;aide-de-camp&lt;/a&gt; to Governor General &lt;a href=\"Louis-Florent%2C%20marquis%20de%20Vali%C3%A8re\"&gt;Vali\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;, who commanded at Saint-Domingue.\nIn 1772, Navy Minister &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20%C3%89tienne%20Bourgeois%20de%20Boynes\"&gt;Boynes&lt;/a&gt; acceded to repeated requests from Latouche's family, and he was reinstated in the Navy as \"capitaine de br\u00fblot\". Latouche was appointed to command the &lt;a href=\"fluyt\"&gt;fluyt&lt;/a&gt; \"Courtier\". In 1774, Latouche put forward a proposition to the Ministry Navy for an exploratory expedition to &lt;a href=\"Circumnavigation\"&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; Australia to see whether &lt;a href=\"New%20Holland%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;New Holland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; were separated by a channel; the plan was rejected, as the Ministry preferred using &lt;a href=\"Mauritius\"&gt;\u00cele de France&lt;/a&gt; as the forward base for such an operation. Latouche corresponded with Captain &lt;a href=\"James%20Cook\"&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt; on exploration plans in 1775 and 1776.\nService on \"Hermione\" and the American War of Independence.\nIn May 1777, he was promoted to lieutenant and was given command of the 20-gun &lt;a href=\"corvette\"&gt;corvette&lt;/a&gt; \"Rossignol\", which escorted convoys and ferried messages. He captured two English privateers and three merchantmen. His prizes saw him appointed &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Saint%20Louis\"&gt;Knight of the Order of Saint-Louis&lt;/a&gt;. He was appointed &lt;a href=\"commander\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; of the 26-gun frigate &lt;a href=\"French%20frigate%20Hermione%20%281779%29\"&gt;\"Hermione\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 28 May 1779, \"Hermione\" spotted a British privateer, which she lured into a trap by feigning fleeing in the night. In order to induce a tiring chase, Latouche let his ship's beacon be glimpsed intermittently, before doubling back to attack his opponent in the morning. The privateer was the 18-gun \"Diffidence\", of Falmouth. The next day, another 18-gun privateer attacked and Latouche captured her too, using the same ruse. Latouche then returned to Rochefort with his two prizes and numerous prisoners.\nFrom 21 March to 28 April 1780, Latouche carried General &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Lafayette\"&gt;Lafayette&lt;/a&gt; as a passenger on a transatlantic voyage from France to Boston. Then, joining the fleet under Rear-Admiral &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Ren%C3%A9%20Dominique%20Sochet%2C%20Chevalier%20Destouches\"&gt;Destouches&lt;/a&gt;, and under orders from &lt;a href=\"Jacques-Melchior%20Saint-Laurent%2C%20Comte%20de%20Barras\"&gt;Barras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charles-Henri-Louis%20d%27Arsac%20de%20Ternay\"&gt;Ternay&lt;/a&gt;, he directed the building of several artillery batteries for the defence of &lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter he had completed the batteries, Latouche was allowed to cruise off &lt;a href=\"Long%20Island\"&gt;Long Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"commerce%20raiding\"&gt;intercept shipping&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. He quickly captured two prizes, before spotting four sails on 7 June 1780: these were the frigate &lt;a href=\"USS%20Hancock%20%281776%29\"&gt;\"Iris\"&lt;/a&gt; and three lesser warships. In the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Action%20of%207%20June%201780\"&gt;Action of 7 June 1780&lt;/a&gt;, Latouche was himself shot in the arm by a musket ball, and \"Hermione\" suffered ten deaths and 37 wounded. His opponent, Captain James Hawker, later accused him of fleeing the scene, to which Latouche replied \"In my poor state, I could not pursue you. Why then did you not continue the fight?\"\nOn 16 March, Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cape%20Henry\"&gt;Battle of Cape Henry&lt;/a&gt;, which took place at the mouth of &lt;a href=\"Chesapeake%20Bay\"&gt;Chesapeake Bay&lt;/a&gt;. This action has led to a commonly repeated, but erroneous, report that Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville engaged in a \"battle against the \"Chesapeake\" (March 1781)\".\nOn 13 April 1781, Latouche's father, &lt;a href=\"Louis-Charles%20Le%20Vassor%20de%20La%20Touche\"&gt;Louis-Charles Le Vassor de La Touche&lt;/a&gt;, died in Paris. Latouche inherited his title, and thereafter was styled \"Comte de Latouche\".\nHe then continued cruising off the coast of North America as part of a squadron under the command of Admiral &lt;a href=\"Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Galaup%2C%20comte%20de%20Lap%C3%A9rouse\"&gt;Lap\u00e9rouse&lt;/a&gt;, whose flagship was &lt;a href=\"French%20frigate%20Astr%C3%A9e%20%281780%29\"&gt;\"Astr\u00e9e\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 21 July, the two frigates encountered a British convoy off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;New Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. In the resulting &lt;a href=\"naval%20battle%20of%20Louisbourg\"&gt;naval battle of Louisbourg&lt;/a&gt;, \"Astr\u00e9e\" and \"Hermione\" forced &lt;a href=\"USS%20Boston%20%281777%29\"&gt;HMS \"Charlestown\"&lt;/a&gt; to strike her colours, but failed to board her, allowing her to flee during the night. They did however capture the 14-gun escort, \"Jack\", and three merchantmen, which they brought to Boston.\nService on \"Aigle\".\nAfter returning to France, Latouche was promoted to captain on 20 June 1781. In 1782, he was tasked with ferrying officials, large sums of money and equipment to America, leading a two-frigate squadron comprising &lt;a href=\"French%20frigate%20Aigle%20%281782%29\"&gt;\"Aigle\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"French%20frigate%20Gloire%20%281778%29\"&gt;\"Gloire\"&lt;/a&gt;, under Captain de Vallongue.\nLatouche assumed command of the frigate &lt;a href=\"French%20frigate%20Aigle%20%281782%29\"&gt;\"Aigle\"&lt;/a&gt; which, along with the \"Gloire\", ferried funds and equipment for the fleet of Admiral de &lt;a href=\"Louis-Philippe%20de%20Vaudreuil\"&gt;Vaudreuil&lt;/a&gt;. On 5 September 1782, the squadron encountered the lone 74-gun &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Hector%20%281756%29\"&gt;HMS \"Hector\"&lt;/a&gt;: in the &lt;a href=\"action%20of%205%20September%201782\"&gt;ensuing two-day battle&lt;/a&gt;, the two frigates heavily damaged the \"Hector\", and only failed to captured her when a British squadron appeared on the horizon. Latouche retreated, and \"Hector\" foundered a few days later.\nCapture.\nThe frigates continued on their journey when, on 12 September, they spotted a British squadron, comprising two ships of the line with a frigate, two corvettes and a &lt;a href=\"brig-sloop\"&gt;brig-sloop&lt;/a&gt;. Latouche captured the brig, . Latouche then tacked into the &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20River\"&gt;Delaware River&lt;/a&gt;, as , , and the prize \"Sophie\", led by Captain G.K. Elphinston in , gave chase. Latouche landed his passengers and treasure with launches from the frigates. He then attempted to escape his much stronger opponents by sailing over the banks at the mouth of the Delaware River, but \"Aigle\" ran aground; \"Gloire\" also touched bottom, but she managed to free herself and reach the channel. Latouche attempted to free \"Aigle\", but with the retreating tide, she became not only more and more firmly beached, but also fell on her side, rendering her battery unserviceable. Seeing his ship lost, Latouche had her the masts chopped off and her hull pierced; he then evacuated her crew; staying behind with only a few men, Latouche fired a few shots from his &lt;a href=\"stern%20chaser\"&gt;stern chaser&lt;/a&gt;s before striking his colours. Despite the measures to disable \"Aigle\", the British were able to recover her and took her into service as HMS \"Aigle\".\nAdmiral Vaudreuil wrote to the Minister of the Navy &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Eug%C3%A8ne%20Gabriel%20de%20La%20Croix\"&gt;Castrie&lt;/a&gt;:\nLatouche was taken as a prisoner to New York, and transferred from there to England. He remained a prisoner until the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29\"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt; in 1783.\nService in France during the Revolution.\nUpon Latouche's return in France, he was appointed to direct Rochefort harbour. He was also tasked with drawing a map of &lt;a href=\"Ol%C3%A9ron\"&gt;Ol\u00e9ron&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in the first volume of \"Hydrographie fran\u00e7aise\". In 1784 he succeeded &lt;a href=\"Bruni%20d%27Entrecasteaux\"&gt;Bruni d'Entrecasteaux&lt;/a&gt; as vice-director of the Harbours and Arsenals, holding the position until 1787, when he became Chancellor to the &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Philippe%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans\"&gt;Duke of Orl\u00e9ans&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, he had also served as an inspector for the gunnery school of the Naval Academy, and co-authored the Naval Code for 1786. In July 1786, he sailed a corvette from &lt;a href=\"Honfleur\"&gt;Honfleur&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Le%20Havre\"&gt;Le Havre&lt;/a&gt;, ferrying king &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XVI%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis uncle, &lt;a href=\"Charles-Auguste%20Levassor%20de%20La%20Touche-Tr%C3%A9ville\"&gt;Charles-Auguste Levassor de La Touche-Tr\u00e9ville&lt;/a&gt;, died in 1788 and bequeathed him his name; henceforth, Latouche added \"Tr\u00e9ville\" to his name, becoming the \"comte de Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville\".\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in 1789, Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville was elected deputy of the &lt;a href=\"Estates%20General%20%28France%29\"&gt;Nobility&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"bailiwick\"&gt;bailiwick&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Montargis\"&gt;Montargis&lt;/a&gt;; he went on to sit at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Constituent%20Assembly%20%28France%29\"&gt;National Constituent Assembly&lt;/a&gt; and held this position until it adjourned on 10 October 1791. Latouche took a liberal posture and was among the first nobles to join forces with the Third Estate. In September 1791, after king Louis XVI approved the new constitution, the National Constituent Assembly disbanded, and Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville resumed his naval activities.\nLatouche had held the rank of rear-admiral since 20 December 1790 reform of the navy. In this capacity, in 1792 he took command of a four-ship squadron in &lt;a href=\"Brest%2C%20France\"&gt;Brest&lt;/a&gt;. He sailed from Brest to &lt;a href=\"Toulon\"&gt;Toulon&lt;/a&gt;, on his flagship the &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Languedoc%20%281766%29\"&gt;\"Languedoc\"&lt;/a&gt;, to attach his division to the Mediterranean squadron under Rear-admiral &lt;a href=\"Laurent%20Jean%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truguet\"&gt;Truguet&lt;/a&gt;. He took part in raids against &lt;a href=\"Oneglia\"&gt;Oneglia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cagliari\"&gt;Cagliari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nice\"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt; during the , and joined in the attack on &lt;a href=\"Sardinia\"&gt;Sardinia&lt;/a&gt; in October 1792 (which turned out to be a failure when the expeditionary corps was repulsed). Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville and Truguet then returned to Toulon.\nLatouche-Tr\u00e9ville was promoted to rear-admiral on 1 January 1793. He was then sent on a mission to &lt;a href=\"Napoli\"&gt;Napoli&lt;/a&gt;, after that kingdom's ambassador to &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; had precipitated a diplomatic conflict by insulting his French counterpart. Latouche threatened to bombard the city, and obtained apologies from &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20I%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies\"&gt;Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies&lt;/a&gt;. Latouche then departed, but had to double back to Napoli to repair due to gale-force winds, eventually making his rendezvous with Truguet on 8 February 1793. On 14 February, they landed 6,000 volunteers at Cagliari, who had to reembark under fire and in a gale two days later. The fleet then returned to Toulon once more.\nIn March 1793, amid the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition\"&gt;War of the First Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, Latouche took command of the \"Naval Army of the Ocean\" (the Brest fleet), but as soon as he took up his position, revolutionary subordinates denounced him as an aristocrat. On 15 September, at the height of the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Reign of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, he was arrested as a \"suspect\" on orders of the &lt;a href=\"Committee%20of%20Public%20Safety\"&gt;Committee of Public Safety&lt;/a&gt;, and cashiered on 3 October. He spent one year in &lt;a href=\"La%20Force%20Prison\"&gt;La Force Prison&lt;/a&gt;, and was freed only on 20 September 1794, after the &lt;a href=\"Thermidorian%20Reaction\"&gt;Thermidorian Reaction&lt;/a&gt;.\nFreed, Latouche returned to Montargis, where he was appointed chief of the Legion of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Guard%20%28France%29\"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt; for the district. A &lt;a href=\"Freemasonry\"&gt;Freemason&lt;/a&gt;, he rose to \"V\u00e9n\u00e9rable\" in the Lodge \"Les Disciples d\u2019Heredom et de la Madeleine R\u00e9unis\", of Montargis. Latouche was rehabilitated under the &lt;a href=\"French%20Directory\"&gt;Directoire&lt;/a&gt; and had his rank reinstated in December 1795, but nonetheless was left for five years without a command in the Navy. From 1797 to 1798, he managed equipment for the Navy with a ship-owner friend, and by 1799 he had grown so desperate that he advertised in \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Moniteur%20Universel\"&gt;Le Moniteur Universel&lt;/a&gt;\" for privateer captainships. It was not until 1799 that he returned to active duty.\nService at the Flottille de Boulogne.\nIn 1799, Latouche was appointed to lead a naval division in Brest, with his mark on the 74-gun &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Mont-Blanc%20%281791%29\"&gt;\"Mont-Blanc\"&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, he was appointed to command the full Brest fleet, and transferred his flag onto the 110-gun &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Terrible%20%281779%29\"&gt;\"Terrible\"&lt;/a&gt;. Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville defended the harbour until the government decided to disband the naval Army of Brest; Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville then sailed four of its ships to Rochefort.\nSoon after, advised by Navy minister &lt;a href=\"Pierre-Alexandre-Laurent%20Forfait\"&gt;Forfait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"French%20Consulate\"&gt;First Consul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt; chose Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville to organise and lead the \"&lt;a href=\"Flottille%20de%20Boulogne\"&gt;Flottille de Boulogne&lt;/a&gt;\". This vast fleet of small ships was ostensibly designed to ferry an invasion army to England, but was in fact a disinformation ploy to pressure the British into negotiating the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Amiens\"&gt;Treaty of Amiens&lt;/a&gt;. The ploy helped to disguise the true goal of the French military, which was massing armies in Boulogne for an invasion of Austria. Soon after his arrival, on 4 August and 15 August 1801, Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville repelled the &lt;a href=\"Raid%20on%20Boulogne%20%281801%29\"&gt;several British raids&lt;/a&gt; that Admiral &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Nelson\"&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt; launched to destroy the \"Flottille\".\nService at Saint-Domingue.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20of%20Amiens\"&gt;Peace of Amiens&lt;/a&gt;, Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville was appointed to command the naval squadron of Rochefort, comprising six ships of the line, six frigates and two corvettes, in the fleet of Admiral &lt;a href=\"Villaret%20de%20Joyeuse\"&gt;Villaret de Joyeuse&lt;/a&gt;, ferrying 3,000 men of the Army of Rhine for the &lt;a href=\"Saint-Domingue%20expedition\"&gt;Saint-Domingue expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Latouche fought his way into the harbour of &lt;a href=\"Port-au-Prince\"&gt;Port-au-Prince&lt;/a&gt;, captured its forts and landed the troops. He and General Boudet captured &lt;a href=\"Port-au-Prince\"&gt;Port-au-Prince&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9og%C3%A2ne\"&gt;L\u00e9og\u00e2ne&lt;/a&gt;. Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville managed to obtain the peaceful surrender of General Laplume, while, in the south, General &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Leclerc%20%28general%2C%20born%201772%29\"&gt;Leclerc&lt;/a&gt; forced &lt;a href=\"Toussaint%20L%27Ouverture\"&gt;Toussaint L'Ouverture&lt;/a&gt; and Christophe to submit to French authority.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Villaret%20de%20Joyeuse\"&gt;Villaret de Joyeuse&lt;/a&gt;'s departure in April 1802, Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville stayed in Saint-Domingue with four ships of the line, nine frigates and five corvettes. After the restoration of slavery on 20 May 1802, a new rebellion broke out, which overwhelmed the yellow-fever-stricken army of General Leclerc. Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville defended the harbours in the south, appointing &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Philibert%20Willaumez\"&gt;Willaumez&lt;/a&gt; to the western naval station of Saint-Domingue. The situation grew even more desperate after the British started the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Third%20Coalition\"&gt;War of the Third Coalition&lt;/a&gt; in May 1803: Willaumez had to return to France to repair his frigate, damaged in the &lt;a href=\"action%20of%2028%20June%201803\"&gt;action of 28 June 1803&lt;/a&gt;, and the British effected a &lt;a href=\"Blockade%20of%20Saint-Domingue\"&gt;Blockade of Saint-Domingue&lt;/a&gt; that ended with the complete destruction of Rochambeau's army. In October 1803, Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville obtained free passage from the British due to his poor health, and returned to France.\nService as commander of the fleet of Toulon.\nLatouche-Tr\u00e9ville was made a vice-admiral in December 1803. Returned to France, he was appointed general inspector of the coasts of the Mediterranean, before taking command of the fleet of Toulon, with his flag on the brand-new 80-gun \"&lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Bucentaure%20%281804%29\"&gt;Bucentaure&lt;/a&gt;\". At the time, the squadron counted only seven ships of the line and four frigates, and discipline was much weakened; in particular, Navy officers slept aboard their ships only when forced to do so by their duty. Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville made a point to live on his ship, and morale quickly improved under his example and leadership.\nLatouche-Tr\u00e9ville decided to have one ship or frigate patrol for three days outside the harbour, in rotation, while another would always be ready to put to sail at the first signal. Furthermore, the entire squadron regularly scrambled to support the cruisers whenever superior British forces ventured into Toulon harbour, preventing the British from conducting useful reconnaissance of French activities in the area. Over the time, the squadron received three more ships of the line and three more frigates as reinforcements.\nIn late June 1804, Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville suffered a relapse of a medical condition contracted at Saint-Domingue. However, he constantly refused to transfer ashore, stating \"An admiral is only too glad when he can die under the flag of his ship.\" Indeed, after a 10-day struggle, on 19 August, Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville died aboard \"Bucentaure\". Lord Nelson later wrote:\nLegacy.\nLatouche-Tr\u00e9ville was buried in Toulon graveyard. In 1810, a seven-metre-high pyramidal mausoleum was built at the S\u00e9maphore de la Croix des Signaux, at Cape C\u00e9pet, from where Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville had observed the British in his last year. On 14 October 1902, military authorities decided to move the mausoleum to the military graveyard of &lt;a href=\"Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer\"&gt;Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer&lt;/a&gt;; the body was transferred on 29 April 1903.\nFrench authors and historians often compared Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville to Nelson, partly because he fought and defeated him in the &lt;a href=\"Raids%20on%20Boulogne\"&gt;Raids on Boulogne&lt;/a&gt;, partly because, had it not been for his untimely death, he would have opposed Nelson at &lt;a href=\"Trafalgar%20Campaign\"&gt;Trafalgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name \"Latouche\" was &lt;a href=\"Names%20inscribed%20under%20the%20Arc%20de%20Triomphe\"&gt;inscribed&lt;/a&gt; on the north face of the &lt;a href=\"Arc%20de%20Triomphe\"&gt;Arc de Triomphe&lt;/a&gt; in his honour.\nThree ships of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; have been named &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Latouche-Tr%C3%A9ville\"&gt;\"Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville\"&lt;/a&gt; in his honour: the steam aviso &lt;a href=\"French%20aviso%20Latouche-Tr%C3%A9ville%20%281860%29\"&gt;\"Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville\"&lt;/a&gt; in 1860; the armoured cruiser &lt;a href=\"French%20cruiser%20Latouche-Tr%C3%A9ville\"&gt;\"Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville\"&lt;/a&gt; in 1892; and the &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Leygues-class%20frigate\"&gt;F70-type&lt;/a&gt; destroyer &lt;a href=\"French%20frigate%20Latouche-Tr%C3%A9ville%20%28D646%29\"&gt;\"Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville\"&lt;/a&gt;, presently in commission."
