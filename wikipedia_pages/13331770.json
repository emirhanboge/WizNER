    "text": "David Mills (born 6 December 1951) is an English former &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; most notable for his career with &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; and becoming England's first \u00a3500,000 footballer.\nHe is currently working as the head scout for &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nMiddlesbrough.\nMills was born in &lt;a href=\"Whitby\"&gt;Whitby&lt;/a&gt;, and brought up in &lt;a href=\"Thornaby-on-Tees\"&gt;Thornaby-on-Tees&lt;/a&gt; and while at school represented his country with England Schoolboys. After school, he attracted interest from several clubs, including &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Stoke City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burnley%20F.C.\"&gt;Burnley&lt;/a&gt;, but decided on a move to local team Middlesbrough, after missing close to a year due to injury, and signed for the club in July 1968\nHis first team debut came as a substitute towards the end of the 1968\u201369 season and he scored at &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindown Town&lt;/a&gt; in 1969\u201370 on his full debut. He became a regular two seasons later. As part of Boro's 1973\u201374 &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; championship side, he scored the goal that earned the side promotion in the 1\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"Luton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Luton Town&lt;/a&gt;. Mills came to the attention of the &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team\"&gt;England Under 23&lt;/a&gt; selectors, earning eight caps and scoring three goals. His best season in terms of goals was in the 1976\u201377 season, in which he scored 18 times in 41 games, making him top scorer that season. He retained that title the next season.\nIn December 1976, Mills asked for a move and so was &lt;a href=\"Transfer%20market\"&gt;transfer listed&lt;/a&gt; at a value of \u00a3200,000, but nobody came in for him. Two years later, his form had again caught the attention of other managers, and so in 1979, &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Atkinson\"&gt;Ron Atkinson&lt;/a&gt; paid \u00a3518,000 to take him to &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt;, breaking the English transfer record and making Mills Britain's first half million pound footballer.\nOther Clubs.\nMills scored on his first full appearance for West Brom, but despite the huge sum of money invested in him he was not given many opportunities to prove himself, with injuries, loss of form and a switch to &lt;a href=\"midfielder\"&gt;midfield&lt;/a&gt; limiting his goals. After scoring only six goals in 59 appearances, he was loaned out to &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the loan, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; for just \u00a330,000, but he only remained there for a short time, moving back to Newcastle on a permanent transfer.\nBack at Middlesbrough.\nIn June 1984, &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Maddren\"&gt;Willie Maddren&lt;/a&gt; re-signed him for one season, in which he finished top scorer with 14 goals. He suffered an &lt;a href=\"Achilles%20tendon\"&gt;Achilles tendon&lt;/a&gt; injury and a broken arm the following season and did not play. He had a short spell after this playing for &lt;a href=\"Darlington%20F.C.\"&gt;Darlington&lt;/a&gt;, where he ended his career as a player in 1987. After coaching Middlesbrough's juniors, Mills went on to play for &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Northern League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Whitby%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Whitby Town&lt;/a&gt;. He was seriously injured in a car crash on &lt;a href=\"Tyneside\"&gt;Tyneside&lt;/a&gt;, which claimed the life of his father. Later, he went on to work as a representative for a printing firm.\nScouting Roles.\nFollowing a stint as assistant chief scout at &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked under seven different managers, it was announced on 29 April 2008 that Mills would return to Middlesbrough to boost the recruitment team along with &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20McQueen\"&gt;Gordon McQueen&lt;/a&gt;. Mills has since worked closely with Steve Walsh at &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt;, as a chief scout Mills has worked alongside Walsh to bring young emerging talent to &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt; with many ex-&lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; youth players now found at both clubs."
