    "text": "Gallia Club, also known as Gallia Club Paris to identify the club's location, was a French amateur &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. The club was founded in 1896 and were known as \"Les coqs\" (The Roosters). Gallia Club was among the few clubs that participated in France's first-ever football league, \"Le Championnat de USFSA\", joining the league for the 1896\u201397 season. The club won its only &lt;a href=\"Union%20des%20Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9s%20Fran%C3%A7aises%20de%20Sports%20Athl%C3%A9tiques\"&gt;USFSA&lt;/a&gt; league title in the 1904\u201305 season defeating &lt;a href=\"RC%20Roubaix\"&gt;Roubaix&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 at the &lt;a href=\"Parc%20des%20Princes\"&gt;Parc des Princes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Midfielder\"&gt;Midfielder&lt;/a&gt; Georges Bayrou was particularly instrumental in the club's success. Bayrou later went on to become one of the founding fathers of professionalism in &lt;a href=\"French%20football\"&gt;French football&lt;/a&gt;. Gallia Club also won the Coupe Manier and the Coupe Dewar in 1904 and 1909, respectively. Following the collapse of the USFSA, Gallia Club fell to the Division d'Honneur and never recovered domestically. The club had limited success in the &lt;a href=\"Coupe%20de%20France\"&gt;Coupe de France&lt;/a&gt; and, after merging with Stade d'Ivry in 1926, Gallia disbanded in 1940 just before &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt;."
