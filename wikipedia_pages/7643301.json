    "text": "The Center for Media and Public Affairs (CMPA) is a self-described &lt;a href=\"nonpartisan\"&gt;nonpartisan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nonprofit\"&gt;nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"research\"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; and educational organization that is affiliated with &lt;a href=\"George%20Mason%20University\"&gt;George Mason University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Fairfax, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded in 1985 by political scientists &lt;a href=\"S.%20Robert%20Lichter\"&gt;S. Robert Lichter&lt;/a&gt; and his ex-wife Linda Lichter. It published a newsletter called \"Media Monitor\" from 1987 to 2010.\nResearch.\nThe CMPA conducts studies of the &lt;a href=\"news\"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; and entertainment &lt;a href=\"Mass%20media\"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;. Among its activities are a continuing &lt;a href=\"analysis\"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tabulation\"&gt;tabulation&lt;/a&gt; of late night &lt;a href=\"political%20jokes\"&gt;political jokes&lt;/a&gt;, an annual report on diversity among network news journalists, and a &lt;a href=\"content%20analysis\"&gt;content analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the nightly news on the major broadcast and cable news networks.\nThe results of the latter are compiled in the CMPA newsletter. CMPA engages in &lt;a href=\"health%20communication\"&gt;health communication&lt;/a&gt; research, investigating the way in which &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;scientific issues&lt;/a&gt; are conveyed in the media. CMPA also engages in &lt;a href=\"survey%20research\"&gt;survey research&lt;/a&gt; to determine the accuracy of media's reports of scientific opinion.\nCMPA conducts &lt;a href=\"social%20science\"&gt;social scientific&lt;/a&gt; research on &lt;a href=\"mass%20media\"&gt;media coverage&lt;/a&gt; with the use of such techniques as &lt;a href=\"content%20analysis\"&gt;content analysis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"survey%20research\"&gt;survey research&lt;/a&gt;. Its studies appear in &lt;a href=\"academic%20journals\"&gt;academic journals&lt;/a&gt; and reference works as well as in popular media outlets.\nCMPA's signature activity is its \"rapid response\" studies of media coverage of current issues, which appear quickly enough to influence ongoing &lt;a href=\"debate\"&gt;public debates&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"election\"&gt;presidential campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; confirmation hearings, and major policy debates in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough CMPA avoids taking stands on political issues, its studies have sometimes become part of the public debate over the media's role in &lt;a href=\"politics\"&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt;. For example, in 1992 a CMPA study found that the average length of a presidential candidate's &lt;a href=\"soundbite\"&gt;soundbite&lt;/a&gt; on the evening news had dropped to less than ten seconds, down from 42 seconds in 1968. In response CBS adopted a policy requiring longer soundbites on the &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Evening%20News\"&gt;CBS Evening News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Edward%20S.%20Herman\"&gt;Edward S. Herman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Noam%20Chomsky\"&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt; asserted in \"&lt;a href=\"Manufacturing%20Consent\"&gt;Manufacturing Consent&lt;/a&gt;\" (1988) that the CMPA, along with several similar organizations, create \"flak\", which they define as \"negative responses to a media statement or program\" which they maintained is part of a project of \"&lt;a href=\"dominant%20ideology\"&gt;disciplining&lt;/a&gt; the media.\"\nCMPA studies of entertainment media have been used by members of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; such as Sen. &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Lieberman\"&gt;Joe Lieberman&lt;/a&gt; (I-CT) in their efforts to reduce gratuitous violence and sex in television entertainment. CMPA's research on entertainment media has also included studies of how various groups have been portrayed on television, such as studies of Hispanic Americans' portrayals commissioned by the National Council of &lt;a href=\"La%20Raza\"&gt;La Raza&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Commission%20on%20Civil%20Rights\"&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedia Monitor.\nMedia Monitor was the bi-monthly publication of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, which presented the central findings of one or more research studies on &lt;a href=\"media%20monitoring\"&gt;media monitoring&lt;/a&gt;. It was started in 1987 and last published in 2010. It was a concise analysis of contemporary &lt;a href=\"media%20coverage\"&gt;media coverage&lt;/a&gt; and the controversies that surround it. The research published was the result of quantitative &lt;a href=\"content%20analysis\"&gt;content analysis&lt;/a&gt; of television, print, and radio &lt;a href=\"news\"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunding.\nThe media watchdog group &lt;a href=\"Fairness%20and%20Accuracy%20in%20Reporting\"&gt;Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting&lt;/a&gt; (FAIR) has challenged CMPA's non-partisan claim, based on the argument that much of its funding has come from conservative sources, and that its founder, &lt;a href=\"S.%20Robert%20Lichter\"&gt;S. Robert Lichter&lt;/a&gt;, once held a chair in &lt;a href=\"mass%20communications\"&gt;mass communications&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"American%20Enterprise%20Institute\"&gt;American Enterprise Institute&lt;/a&gt; and was a &lt;a href=\"Fox%20News\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; contributor. After a \"Washington Post\" article referred to CMPA as \"&lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;,\" the \"Post\" published a \"Clarification,\" which concluded, \"The Center describes itself as nonpartisan, and its studies have been cited by both conservative and liberal commentators.\""
