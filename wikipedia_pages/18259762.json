    "text": " \nEl Lado Oscuro (&lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;en:&lt;/a&gt; \"The Dark Side\") is the second studio album by &lt;a href=\"power%20metal\"&gt;power metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"DarkSun\"&gt;DarkSun&lt;/a&gt;, released in 2004. The band entered the studios at the end of 2003. Just like \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Legado%20%28DarkSun%20album%29\"&gt;El Legado&lt;/a&gt;\", this album was recorded in Germany, with Ingo Cjavkoski in the production. This time the band had Dennis Ward on mixings. (who was better known for his work with &lt;a href=\"Angra%20%28band%29\"&gt;Angra&lt;/a&gt;), and Lars Ratz (from &lt;a href=\"Metalium\"&gt;Metalium&lt;/a&gt;) assisted on the vocals production. Once again the reviews were as good as they could possibly be, like \"...it's a varied work, where &lt;a href=\"power%20metal\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; alternate and mi\", and \"\"El Lado Oscuro\" is a really good power metal album\". &lt;a href=\"Peavy%20Wagner\"&gt;Peavy Wagner&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a href=\"Rage%20%28German%20band%29\"&gt;Rage&lt;/a&gt; fame) performed vocals on a song, which was released as a bonus track on the album, entitled \"Prisoners of Fate\"."
