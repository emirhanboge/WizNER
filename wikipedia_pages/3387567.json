They are currently members of the and play at the Oval.\nHistory.\nThe first club from which the modern Bedworth United traces its lineage was Bedworth Town, established in 1895. In 1898 they were founder members of the Nuneaton &amp; District League, but had folded by 1900. The name Bedworth Town was resurrected in 1905 when Bedworth Evening Combination School of the Coventry &amp; North Warwickshire League changed their name. However, they folded in the early 1920s. The name was restored to use again in 1925 when Collycroft United (founded 1916 and also members of the Coventry &amp; North Warwickshire League, were renamed. In 1936 they joined the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Amateur%20League\"&gt;Central Amateur League&lt;/a&gt;, but played in the league for only one season.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, a new Bedworth Town club was established in 1947. They joined the &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20Combination\"&gt;Birmingham Combination&lt;/a&gt;, finishing third in their first season, before winning back-to-back titles in 1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350. In 1954 the club moved up to the Northern Division of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League\"&gt;Birmingham &amp; District League&lt;/a&gt;, and were placed in Division One the following season after league reorganisation. In 1962 the league was renamed the &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League\"&gt;West Midlands (Regional) League&lt;/a&gt;.

A sixth-place finish in &lt;a href=\"1981%E2%80%9382%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;1981\u201382&lt;/a&gt; was enough to earn a place in the new Premier Division in 1982. In &lt;a href=\"1988%E2%80%9389%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;1988\u201389&lt;/a&gt; they finished bottom of the division and were relegated to Division One Midlands, which became the Western Division in 1999.
