    "text": "The Shift Project (also called \"The Shift\" or TSP) is a French &lt;a href=\"Association%20loi%20de%201901\"&gt;nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; created in 2010 that aims to limit both &lt;a href=\"climate%20change\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; and the dependency of our economy on &lt;a href=\"fossil%20fuels\"&gt;fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresentation, goals and organization.\nThe Shift Project is a French &lt;a href=\"Association%20loi%20de%201901\"&gt;nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; created in January 2010 in Paris by energy-climate experts such as &lt;a href=\"Jean-Marc%20Jancovici\"&gt;Jean-Marc Jancovici&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genevi%C3%A8ve%20F%C3%A9rone\"&gt;Genevi\u00e8ve F\u00e9rone&lt;/a&gt;-Creuzet and Michel Lepetit. The organization aims to address two issues raised by the use of &lt;a href=\"carbon\"&gt;carbon&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"climate%20change\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fossil%20fuel%23Limits%20and%20alternatives\"&gt;depletion of fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;. The Shift works as a &lt;a href=\"think%20tank\"&gt;think tank&lt;/a&gt; that shares ideas with economic, political, academic and voluntary actors.\nThe Shift Project is funded by corporate sponsors. Its budget for 2017 was about 600,000 euros.\nThe organization is led by a group of three people elected by the board of directors, which includes members of the sponsoring companies. A group of experts, called Expert Committee (), ensures the scientific validity of the work done by The Shift Project. This group of experts (in economics, finance, climate, physics, history...) includes &lt;a href=\"Alain%20Grandjean\"&gt;Alain Grandjean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ga%C3%ABl%20Giraud\"&gt;Ga\u00ebl Giraud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herv%C3%A9%20Le%20Treut\"&gt;Herv\u00e9 Le Treut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jean-Pascal%20van%20Ypersele%20de%20Strihou\"&gt;Jean-Pascal van Ypersele&lt;/a&gt; and Jacques Treiner. At the creation of the think tank, the first director is C\u00e9dric Ringenbach. He stays at this position until 2016, when he leaves The Shift Project and creates &lt;a href=\"Nonprofit%20organization%23France\"&gt;nonprofit organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Climate%20Collage\"&gt;The Climate Collage&lt;/a&gt;. Now headed by &lt;a href=\"Matthieu%20Auzanneau\"&gt;Matthieu Auzanneau&lt;/a&gt;, The Shift has a team of about ten employees and works with volunteers who are grouped into an independent nonprofit called \"The Shifters\".\nThe Shift examines the dependency of our economy on oil through three angles: the potential &lt;a href=\"Returns%20%28economics%29\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; of economic growth, the issues related to the finite amount of &lt;a href=\"Peak%20oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; and, of course, the climate change due to carbon emissions. According to The Shift, although the GDP may have use cases, it is not really useful, especially because it does not consider natural resources (so it does not account for their limited availability) or resulting externalities like &lt;a href=\"greenhouse%20gas%20emissions\"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;.\nProjects, events and activities.\nSince 2012, The Shift Project has organized an annual two-day meeting called The Shift Forum with the objective of running a debate between big industrial and financial company leaders and experts on climate, energy and economics. The Shift also organizes many public events, sometimes in collaboration with other organizations like the Business and Climate Summit 2015 or the World Efficiency 2015.\nThe nonprofit also contributed to the National Debate for Energy Transition in France and its president, &lt;a href=\"Jean-Marc%20Jancovici\"&gt;Jean-Marc Jancovici&lt;/a&gt;, is a member of the French Committee on Climate Change.\nMain publications.\nThe Shift mostly works in task forces: for a couple of months or years, a group of experts (from higher education and academic research, NGOs, public sector, companies...) is set up on a well-defined question. When the project ends, the task force writes a report and presents it to concerned actors. The report is then made publicly available.\nAddressed issues include the building rehabilitation to make them more energy-efficient, the relation between energy and GDP, alternative metrics to GDP, the scientific rigor of energy scenarios, sustainable mobility or the price of carbon.\nFor the price of carbon in Europe, the Shift suggests to set a &lt;a href=\"reservation%20price\"&gt;reservation price&lt;/a&gt; to 20 &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s and increase it every year.\nSince 2013, The Shift has been gathering experts on the energy rehabilitation of buildings and made propositions like the Energy Efficiency Passport. In addition to being experimented by the Shift through the nonprofit organization \"Exp\u00e9rience P2E\", this building passport was then included in the &lt;a href=\"Loi%20relative%20%C3%A0%20la%20transition%20%C3%A9nerg%C3%A9tique%20pour%20la%20croissance%20verte\"&gt;Energy Transition Law&lt;/a&gt; and is now used by various actors in the building industry.\nIn 2016, at The Shift Project request, the engineer &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Luciano\"&gt;Francisco Luciano&lt;/a&gt; gathered a team of experts including the &lt;a href=\"Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20nationale%20des%20chemins%20de%20fer%20fran%C3%A7ais\"&gt;SNCF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vinci%20Autoroutes\"&gt;Vinci Autoroutes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%89lectricit%C3%A9%20de%20France\"&gt;EDF&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Club%20des%20villes%20et%20territoires%20cyclables\"&gt;CVTC&lt;/a&gt;, start-ups in &lt;a href=\"Carsharing\"&gt;car sharing&lt;/a&gt;, the senior official Olivier Paul-Dubois-Taine and researchers. In September 2017, The Shift published the report \"Decarbonize mid-density areas \u2013 Less carbon more bond\", for which The Shift and the project leader Francisco Luciano were invited by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Ecology\"&gt;Ministry for Transportation&lt;/a&gt; to attend the &lt;a href=\"Assises%20de%20la%20mobilit%C3%A9\"&gt;Mobility Foundations&lt;/a&gt; and various governmental working groups. The report, which is aimed to be well-argued and quantitative, concludes that it is possible to strongly decarbonize mobility in suburban areas thanks to &lt;a href=\"Cycling%20infrastructure\"&gt;cycling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carsharing\"&gt;car sharing&lt;/a&gt; and fast public transports. The working group also studied the &lt;a href=\"Delivery%20%28commerce%29\"&gt;delivery of goods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Telecommuting\"&gt;remote work&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 4 October 2018, the think tank published a report on the &lt;a href=\"digital%20economy\"&gt;digital economy&lt;/a&gt; impact on climate and environment. The report notes that the worldwide energy consumption of the digital economy grows at a very fast rate (about 9% a year) with a worsening energy efficiency, unlike most economic sectors. It concludes by advocating digital sobriety to minimize most of this impact growth.\nPledge for climate: The 2017 Decarbonize Europe Manifesto.\nThe call for action of the economic actors.\nOn 21 March 2017, the think tank made public the signatories of a text called \"Decarbonize Europe Manifesto\". This text is described as a wake-up call 15 months after the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Agreement\"&gt;Paris Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. It begins with: \"\"We, the signatories of this Manifesto to decarbonize Europe, call upon all European States to immediately implement policies aiming to achieve a level of greenhouse gas emissions close to zero by 2050!\" and aims to \"guarantee peace\"\". It ends with: \"We call upon all European actors \u2013 individuals, businesses and public authorities \u2013 to implement concrete and coherent strategies which can meet the challenge posed by climate change and the limits of natural resources.http://decarbonizeurope.org/en/\" The Shift project claims the decarbonization of Europe is a challenge, but it is necessary for a modern future.\nIt is supported by more than 3,000 citizens including 80 company directors and around forty scientists and political figures. The press mainly mentions the signature of economic leaders like the magazine &lt;a href=\"Challenges%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Challenges&lt;/a&gt;: \"Climate: Why the company directors (at last) unite to decarbonize Europe\".\nThe think tank then called candidates running for president for a commitment in favor of a European plan to fight climate change that would abide by the Paris Agreement\nSignatories of the Manifesto.\nCompany directors who signed the Manifesto include &lt;a href=\"%C3%89lisabeth%20Borne\"&gt;Elisabeth Borne&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9gie%20autonome%20des%20transports%20parisiens\"&gt;RATP&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Bouygues\"&gt;Martin Bouygues&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bouygues\"&gt;Bouygues&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Barbizet\"&gt;Patricia Barbizet&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kering\"&gt;Art\u00e9mis-Kering&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Guillaume%20Pepy\"&gt;Guillaume Pepy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20nationale%20des%20chemins%20de%20fer%20fran%C3%A7ais\"&gt;SNCF&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Christophe%20Cuvillier\"&gt;Christophe Cuvillier&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Unibail-Rodamco\"&gt;Unibail Rodamco&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20Dufourcq\"&gt;Nicolas Dufourq&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bpifrance\"&gt;BPI France&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Blayau\"&gt;Pierre Blayau&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Caisse%20centrale%20de%20r%C3%A9assurance\"&gt;Caise centrale de r\u00e9assurance&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"St%C3%A9phane%20Richard\"&gt;St\u00e9phane Richard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Orange%20%28entreprise%29\"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Alain%20Montarant\"&gt;Alain Montarant&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Mutuelle%20assurance%20des%20commer%C3%A7ants%20et%20industriels%20de%20France%20et%20des%20cadres%20et%20des%20salari%C3%A9s%20de%20l%27industrie%20et%20du%20commerce\"&gt;MACIF&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20Th%C3%A9ry\"&gt;Nicolas Th\u00e9ry&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Cr%C3%A9dit%20mutuel\"&gt;Cr\u00e9dit mutuel&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Denis%20Kessler\"&gt;Denis Kessler&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"SCOR%20SE\"&gt;SCOR&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Xavier%20Huillard\"&gt;Xavier Huillard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Vinci%20%28entreprise%29\"&gt;Vinci&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Jean-Dominique%20Senard\"&gt;Jean-Dominique Senard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Michelin\"&gt;Michelin&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Agni%C3%A8s%20Ogier\"&gt;Agni\u00e8s Ogier&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Thalys\"&gt;Thalys&lt;/a&gt;).\nScientists who signed the Manifesto include climatologists like &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Jouzel\"&gt;Jean Jouzel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herv%C3%A9%20Le%20Treut\"&gt;Herv\u00e9 Le Treut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jean-Pascal%20van%20Ypersele%20de%20Strihou\"&gt;Jean-Pascal van Ypersele&lt;/a&gt;; the biologist and senior official &lt;a href=\"Dominique%20Dron\"&gt;Dominique Dron&lt;/a&gt;; the mathematician &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Ekeland\"&gt;Ivar Ekeland&lt;/a&gt;; physicists like &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A9bastien%20Balibar\"&gt;S\u00e9bastien Balibar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Balian\"&gt;Roger Balian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yves%20Br%C3%A9chet\"&gt;Yves Br\u00e9chet&lt;/a&gt;; economists like &lt;a href=\"Ga%C3%ABl%20Giraud\"&gt;Ga\u00ebl Giraud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Guesnerie\"&gt;Roger Guesnerie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20Aghion\"&gt;Philippe Aghion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christian%20de%20Perthuis\"&gt;Christian de Perthuis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jean-Marie%20Chevalier\"&gt;Jean-Marie Chevalier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jean-Charles%20Hourcade\"&gt;Jean-Charles Hourcade&lt;/a&gt;; directors of &lt;a href=\"grandes%20%C3%A9coles\"&gt;grandes \u00e9coles&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Meriem%20Fournier\"&gt;Meriem Fournier&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"AgroParisTech%20Nancy\"&gt;AgroParis-Tech Nancy&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Olivier%20Oger\"&gt;Olivier Oger&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"EDHEC%20Business%20School\"&gt;EDHEC&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Lafl%C3%A8che\"&gt;Vincent Lafl\u00e8che&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"%C3%89cole%20nationale%20sup%C3%A9rieure%20des%20mines%20de%20Paris\"&gt;Mines ParisTech&lt;/a&gt;).\nOther people who signed it include former ministers like &lt;a href=\"Arnaud%20Montebourg\"&gt;Arnaud Montebourg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serge%20Lepeltier\"&gt;Serge Lepeltier&lt;/a&gt;, the Belgian &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20Maystadt\"&gt;Philippe Maystadt&lt;/a&gt; and the president of the union &lt;a href=\"Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20fran%C3%A7aise%20de%20l%27encadrement%20-%20Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20des%20cadres\"&gt;CFE-CGC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Hommeril\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Hommeril&lt;/a&gt;.\nNine proposals.\nThe Shift Project published \"9 propositions to take Europe to a new area\" about as many projects that should be done imperatively to meet the Paris Agreement, according to the Shift. The &lt;a href=\"Agence%20France-Presse\"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt; specifies that these propositions are made \"\"in parallel with the Manifesto\" and are not \"endorsed by the signatories\"\". The daily economic newspaper &lt;a href=\"Les%20%C3%89chos%20%28France%29\"&gt;Les \u00c9chos&lt;/a&gt; highlights the \"\"plan for a \"carbon-free\" Europe\"\"\nThese propositions concern seven sectors: electricity, transportation, construction, industry, food, agriculture and forestry. They are described in depth in the book \"Let's decarbonize!\"."
