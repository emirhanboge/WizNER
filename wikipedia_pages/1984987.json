    "text": "Tocopilla is a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Chile\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20communes%20in%20Chile\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Antofagasta%20Region\"&gt;Antofagasta Region&lt;/a&gt;, in the north of &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;. It is the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20%28political%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Chile\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; that bears the &lt;a href=\"Tocopilla%20Province\"&gt;same name&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery year Tocopilla celebrates its anniversary on 29 September with a big show the day before, which includes a parade down in the main street of the city, food and a fireworks display at midnight.\nThe city is divided into two main parts consisting of the central city and smaller portion known as \"La Villa Sur\" (in which the more luxurious houses are located). The two parts are divided by the &lt;a href=\"thermoelectric\"&gt;thermoelectric&lt;/a&gt; power plant and a large &lt;a href=\"Potassium%20nitrate\"&gt;saltpeter&lt;/a&gt; processing and shipping plant, with the coastal highway connecting the two portions.\nThe northern portion of Tocopilla is home of the municipal buildings, the central square and many stores and shops. The steep gradient of the city from beach to vertical hillside is covered in houses and apartments crammed together to save space. A large artificial beach called \"Covadonga\" and a small artificial beach called \"Caleta Boy\" are the main attractions during summer months and serve as a focus away from the heat of the &lt;a href=\"Atacama\"&gt;Atacama&lt;/a&gt;. On the north side of the city, there is a black sandy beach called \"El Pante\u00f3n\".\nTocopilla is the birthplace of artist &lt;a href=\"Alejandro%20Jodorowsky\"&gt;Alejandro Jodorowsky&lt;/a&gt; and footballer &lt;a href=\"Alexis%20S%C3%A1nchez\"&gt;Alexis S\u00e1nchez&lt;/a&gt;.\nToponymy.\nTocopilla means \"the devil's corner\" in the &lt;a href=\"Quechuan%20languages\"&gt;Quechua language&lt;/a&gt;.\nJodorowky explains the etymology further in his autobiography \"The Dance of Reality\": \"In the Andean language of Quechua, \"Toco\" means \"double sacred square\" and \"Pilla\" means \"devil.\" In this case, the devil is not the incarnation of evil but a being of the subterranean dimension who gazes through a window made of both spirit and matter\u2014that is, the body\u2014in order to observe the world and share his knowledge with it. Among the &lt;a href=\"Mapuche\"&gt;Mapuche&lt;/a&gt;, \"Pill\u00e1n\" means \"the soul, the human spirit arrived at its final destination.\"\n2007 earthquake.\nOn 14 November 2007, a &lt;a href=\"2007%20Antofagasta%20earthquake\"&gt;magnitude 7.7 earthquake&lt;/a&gt; occurred east-southeast of Tocopilla, followed by aftershocks of magnitude up to 6.8. As a consequence, 1,200 homes were destroyed in Tocopilla, leaving 4,000 of its 27,000 inhabitants homeless. There were two fatalities, and at least 115 were injured.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the 2002 &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Statistics%20Institute%20%28Chile%29\"&gt;National Statistics Institute&lt;/a&gt;, Tocopilla had 23,986 inhabitants (12,050 men and 11,936 women). Of these, 23,352 (97.4%) lived in &lt;a href=\"urban%20area\"&gt;urban area&lt;/a&gt;s and 634 (2.6%) in &lt;a href=\"rural%20area\"&gt;rural area&lt;/a&gt;s. The population fell by 4.0% (999 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.\nAdministration.\nAs a commune, Tocopilla is a third-level &lt;a href=\"administrative%20division%20of%20Chile\"&gt;administrative division of Chile&lt;/a&gt; administered by a &lt;a href=\"municipal%20council\"&gt;municipal council&lt;/a&gt;, headed by an &lt;a href=\"alcalde\"&gt;alcalde&lt;/a&gt; who is directly elected every four years. The 2013-2016 alcalde is Fernando San Rom\u00e1n Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n (Ind./PRO).\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"electoral%20divisions%20of%20Chile\"&gt;electoral divisions of Chile&lt;/a&gt;, Tocopilla is represented in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; by Marcos Espinosa (&lt;a href=\"Social%20Democrat%20Radical%20Party\"&gt;PRSD&lt;/a&gt;) and Felipe Ward (&lt;a href=\"Independent%20Democratic%20Union\"&gt;UDI&lt;/a&gt;) as part of the 3rd electoral district, (together with &lt;a href=\"Mar%C3%ADa%20Elena%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Mar\u00eda Elena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calama%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Calama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ollag%C3%BCe%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Ollag\u00fce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Pedro%20de%20Atacama\"&gt;San Pedro de Atacama&lt;/a&gt;). The commune is represented in the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; by Pedro Araya Guerrero (&lt;a href=\"Independent%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Ind.&lt;/a&gt;) and Alejandro Guillier (&lt;a href=\"Independent%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Ind.&lt;/a&gt;) as part of the 2nd senatorial constituency (Antofagasta Region).\nSports.\nThe city has one &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; team called &lt;a href=\"Deportes%20Tocopilla\"&gt;Deportes Tocopilla&lt;/a&gt; who currently play in &lt;a href=\"Tercera%20B%20%28Chile%29\"&gt;Tercera B (Chile)&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; forward &lt;a href=\"Alexis%20S%C3%A1nchez\"&gt;Alexis&lt;/a&gt; was also born here.\nEconomy.\nThis city generates electricity for the entire &lt;a href=\"Regions%20of%20Chile\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; and is therefore known as \"the city of energy\". When &lt;a href=\"Potassium%20nitrate\"&gt;saltpeter&lt;/a&gt; exportation in Chile was at its highest point, Tocopilla was especially significant as an export point. Nowadays, even when the saltpeter is not so profitable, Tocopilla is still home of companies focused on its extraction.\nIts position along the coast allows it to have an active fishing activity, that along with the mining activity are the main resources. It is a fishing port, with &lt;a href=\"fishmeal\"&gt;fishmeal&lt;/a&gt; and canned fish factories. Through its port the &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Chuquicamata\"&gt;Chuquicamata&lt;/a&gt; and saltpeter from El Toco are exported. Tocopilla has &lt;a href=\"metallurgy\"&gt;metallurgic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chemical%20industry\"&gt;chemical&lt;/a&gt; and nitrate treatment industries, along with the &lt;a href=\"power%20plant\"&gt;power plant&lt;/a&gt;. Due to these activities, Tocopilla is a &lt;a href=\"Commuter%20town\"&gt;dormitory city&lt;/a&gt;, since many people work outside the city.\nTwo other important sports are &lt;a href=\"volleyball\"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt;, with relative success at school and federated level, and &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; with a number of players that have gone to bigger clubs, such as &lt;a href=\"Alexis%20S%C3%A1nchez\"&gt;Alexis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn media.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dance%20of%20Reality\"&gt;The Dance of Reality&lt;/a&gt;\", a 2013 Chilean-French film by &lt;a href=\"Alejandro%20Jodorowsky\"&gt;Alejandro Jodorowsky&lt;/a&gt;, was filmed in Tocopilla.\nThe city is mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Hank%20Snow\"&gt;Hank Snow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Cash\"&gt;Johnny Cash&lt;/a&gt; song \"&lt;a href=\"I%27ve%20Been%20Everywhere\"&gt;I've Been Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.\""
