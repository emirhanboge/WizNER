    "text": "The Communist Party of Peru \u2013 Shining Path (, PCP-SL), commonly shortened to the Shining Path (), is a &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Guerrilla%20warfare\"&gt;guerrilla group&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism%E2%80%93Maoism\"&gt;Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gonzalo%20Thought\"&gt;Gonzalo Thought&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen it first launched during the &lt;a href=\"internal%20conflict%20in%20Peru\"&gt;internal conflict in Peru&lt;/a&gt; in 1980, its goal was to overthrow the state by guerrilla warfare and replace it with a &lt;a href=\"New%20Democracy\"&gt;New Democracy&lt;/a&gt;. The PCP-SL believed that by establishing a &lt;a href=\"dictatorship%20of%20the%20proletariat\"&gt;dictatorship of the proletariat&lt;/a&gt;, inducing a &lt;a href=\"cultural%20revolution\"&gt;cultural revolution&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually sparking a &lt;a href=\"world%20revolution\"&gt;world revolution&lt;/a&gt;, they could arrive at &lt;a href=\"Communist%20society\"&gt;full communism&lt;/a&gt;. Their representatives stated that the then-existing &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20state\"&gt;socialist countries&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"Marxist%20revisionism\"&gt;revisionist&lt;/a&gt;, and the Shining Path was the &lt;a href=\"Vanguardism\"&gt;vanguard&lt;/a&gt; of the world communist movement. The PCP-SL's ideology and tactics have influenced other Maoist &lt;a href=\"Insurgency\"&gt;insurgent&lt;/a&gt; groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Nepal%20%28Maoist%20Centre%29\"&gt;Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre)&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Internationalist%20Movement\"&gt;Revolutionary Internationalist Movement&lt;/a&gt;-affiliated organizations. The Peruvian guerrillas were unique in that they had a high proportion of women; 50% of the combatants and 40% of the commanders were women.\nThe Shining Path has been widely condemned for its brutality, including violence deployed against &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s, trade union organizers, competing &lt;a href=\"Marxist\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; groups, elected officials and the general public. The Shining Path is regarded as a &lt;a href=\"Terrorism\"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; organization by Peru, Japan, the United States, the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, and Canada, all of whom consequently prohibit funding and other financial support to the group. \nSince the captures of Shining Path founder &lt;a href=\"Abimael%20Guzm%C3%A1n\"&gt;Abimael Guzm\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 and his successor &lt;a href=\"Comrade%20Artemio\"&gt;Comrade Artemio&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, the Shining Path has declined in activity. Only one remaining faction of the Shining Path, the &lt;a href=\"Militarized%20Communist%20Party%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Militarized Communist Party of Peru&lt;/a&gt; (MPCP), exists in the &lt;a href=\"Valle%20de%20los%20R%C3%ADos%20Apur%C3%ADmac%2C%20Ene%20y%20Mantaro\"&gt;Valle de los R\u00edos Apur\u00edmac, Ene y Mantaro&lt;/a&gt; (VRAEM) region of Peru, and it has split from Shining Path in order to maintain support of peasants previously persecuted by the Shining Path.\nName.\nThe common name of this group, the Shining Path, distinguishes it from several other Peruvian communist parties with similar names (see &lt;a href=\"Communism%20in%20Peru\"&gt;Communism in Peru&lt;/a&gt;). The name is derived from a maxim of &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Carlos%20Mari%C3%A1tegui\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the original &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Peruvian Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; (from which the rest of communist parties split; now commonly known as the \"PCP-Unidad\") in the 1920s: \"\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism\"&gt;Marxism\u2013Leninism&lt;/a&gt; will open the shining path to revolution\").\nThis maxim was featured on the masthead of the newspaper of a Shining Path &lt;a href=\"front%20group\"&gt;front group&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the number of Peruvian groups that refer to themselves as the Communist Party of Peru, groups are often distinguished by the names of their publications. The followers of this group are generally called \"senderistas\". All documents, periodicals, and other materials produced by the organization are signed as the Communist Party of Peru (PCP). Academics often refer to them as PCP-SL.\nOrganization.\nThe Shining Path currently has many splinter groups following its collapse in support. One main group, the &lt;a href=\"Militarized%20Communist%20Party%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Militarized Communist Party of Peru&lt;/a&gt; (MPCP) of about 450 individuals remained in the &lt;a href=\"Valle%20de%20los%20R%C3%ADos%20Apur%C3%ADmac%2C%20Ene%20y%20Mantaro\"&gt;Valle de los R\u00edos Apur\u00edmac, Ene y Mantaro&lt;/a&gt; (VRAEM) region, reportedly obtains revenue from cocaine trafficking and are reportedly led by two brothers since 1999; V\u00edctor and Jorge Quispe Palomino. The MPCP has attempted to recharacterize themselves to distance itself from the original Shining Path groups that had attacked rural communities in the area, describing Abimael Guzman as a traitor.\nShining Path primarily comprises two groups and their sub-branches; the People's Guerrilla Army (Ej\u00e9rcito Guerrillero Popular) and United Front (Frente Unido).\nPeople's Guerrilla Army.\nThe People's Guerrilla Army (, EGP) was created for the purposes of combat, mobilization and producing an income for Shining Path. The Army was officially created on 3 December 1982. Recently the EGP has made money from selling cigarettes, clothes, candy, competitions and other methods.\nThe EGP structure is made of the following:\nUnited Front.\nThe United Front primarily serves as the political and bureaucratic arm of Shining Path. It has two main branches; the Movement for Amnesty and Fundamental Rights (MOVADEF) and the Front for Unity and Defense of the Peruvian People (FUDEPP).\nMovement for Amnesty and Fundamental Rights (MOVADEF).\nThe Movement for Amnesty and Fundamental Rights (MOVADEF) was created on 20 November 2009 when Alfredo Crespo, the defense lawyer of Abimael Guzm\u00e1n, and fifteen others gathered. Movadef has three sub-branches; the Central Historical Committee, the Provisional Central Committee and the National Executive Committee (CEN). The branch filed to become a political party in Peru with the &lt;a href=\"National%20Jury%20of%20Elections\"&gt;National Jury of Elections&lt;/a&gt; (JNE) in 2011, though the application was denied. The Peruvian government has accused MOVADEF of advocating terrorism.\nFront for Unity and Defense of the Peruvian People (FUDEPP).\nThe Front for Unity and Defense of the Peruvian People (FUDEPP) was created in 2015. In association with MOVADEF, the group announced that it had 73 provincial committees and allegedly received 400,000 to 500,000 signatures for the JNE to participate in the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Peruvian%20general%20election\"&gt;2016 Peruvian general election&lt;/a&gt;. They were ultimately prevented from participating in the elections.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Shining Path was founded in 1969 by &lt;a href=\"Abimael%20Guzm%C3%A1n\"&gt;Abimael Guzm\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, a former university philosophy professor (his followers referred to him by his &lt;a href=\"Pseudonym\"&gt;nom de guerre&lt;/a&gt; Presidente Gonzalo), and a group of 11 others. Guzm\u00e1n was heavily influenced by a trip to China and admired the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Mao%20Zedong\"&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/a&gt;. His teachings created the foundation of its militant Maoist doctrine. It was an offshoot of the &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Communist%20Party%20%28Red%20Flag%29\"&gt;Communist Party of Peru \u2014 \"Bandera Roja\"&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Red%20flag%20%28politics%29\"&gt;red flag&lt;/a&gt;), which in turn split from the original &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Peruvian Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;, a derivation of the &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Peruvian Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; founded by &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Carlos%20Mari%C3%A1tegui\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui&lt;/a&gt; in 1928.\nAntonio D\u00edaz Mart\u00ednez was an agronomist who became a leader of the Shining Path. His books, \"Ayacucho, Hambre y Esperanza\" (1969) and \"China, La Revoluci\u00f3n Agraria\" (1978) expressed his own conviction of the necessity that revolutionary activity in Peru follow strictly the teachings of Mao Zedong. This was his important contribution to the ideology of the Shining Path.\nThe Shining Path first established a foothold at &lt;a href=\"San%20Crist%C3%B3bal%20of%20Huamanga%20University\"&gt;San Crist\u00f3bal of Huamanga University&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Ayacucho\"&gt;Ayacucho&lt;/a&gt;, where Guzm\u00e1n taught philosophy. The university had recently reopened after being closed for about half a century, and many students of the newly educated class adopted the Shining Path's radical ideology. Between 1973 and 1975, Shining Path members gained control of the &lt;a href=\"student%20council\"&gt;student council&lt;/a&gt;s at the Universities of &lt;a href=\"Huancayo\"&gt;Huancayo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"National%20University%20of%20Education%20Enrique%20Guzm%C3%A1n%20y%20Valle\"&gt;La Cantuta&lt;/a&gt;, and they also developed a significant presence at the &lt;a href=\"National%20University%20of%20Engineering\"&gt;National University of Engineering&lt;/a&gt; in Lima and the &lt;a href=\"National%20University%20of%20San%20Marcos\"&gt;National University of San Marcos&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later, it lost many student elections in the universities, including Guzm\u00e1n's San Crist\u00f3bal of Huamanga. It decided to abandon recruiting at the universities and reconsolidate.\nGuzm\u00e1n believed that communism required a \"popular war\" and distanced himself from organizing workers. Beginning on 17 March 1980, the Shining Path held a series of clandestine meetings in Ayacucho, known as the Central Committee's second plenary. It formed a \"Revolutionary Directorate\" that was political and military in nature and ordered its militias to transfer to strategic areas in the provinces to start the \"armed struggle\". The group also held its \"First Military School\", where members were instructed in military tactics and the use of weapons. They also engaged in \"&lt;a href=\"Self-criticism%20%28Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism%29\"&gt;Criticism and Self-criticism&lt;/a&gt;\", a Maoist practice intended to purge bad habits and avoid the repetition of mistakes. During the existence of the First Military School, members of the Central Committee came under heavy criticism. Guzm\u00e1n did not, and he emerged from the First Military School as the clear leader of the Shining Path.\n1980s: The People's War.\nBy 1980, Shining Path had about 500 members. When Peru's military government allowed &lt;a href=\"Elections%20in%20Peru\"&gt;elections&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in twelve years in 1980, the Shining Path was one of the few leftist political groups that declined to take part. It chose to begin guerrilla war in the highlands of the &lt;a href=\"Ayacucho%20Region\"&gt;Ayacucho Region&lt;/a&gt;. On 17 May 1980, on the eve of the presidential elections, it burned ballot boxes in the town of &lt;a href=\"Chuschi\"&gt;Chuschi&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first \"act of war\" by the Shining Path. The perpetrators were quickly caught, and additional ballots were shipped to Chuschi. The elections proceeded without further problems, and the incident received little attention in the Peruvian press.\nThroughout the 1980s, the Shining Path grew both in terms of the territory it controlled and in the number of militants in its organization, particularly in the &lt;a href=\"Andes\"&gt;Andean&lt;/a&gt; highlands. It gained support from local peasants by filling the political void left by the central government and providing what they called \"popular justice\", public trials that disregard any legal and human rights that deliver swift and brutal sentences including public executions. This caused the peasantry of some Peruvian villages to express some sympathy for the Shining Path, especially in the impoverished and neglected regions of &lt;a href=\"Ayacucho%20Region\"&gt;Ayacucho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apur%C3%ADmac%20Region\"&gt;Apur\u00edmac&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Huancavelica%20Region\"&gt;Huancavelica&lt;/a&gt;. At times, the civilian population of small, neglected towns participated in popular trials, especially when the victims of the trials were widely disliked.\nThe Shining Path's credibility benefited from the government's initially tepid response to the &lt;a href=\"insurgency\"&gt;insurgency&lt;/a&gt;. For over a year, the government refused to declare a &lt;a href=\"state%20of%20emergency\"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt; in the region where the Shining Path was operating. The Interior Minister, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de la Jara, believed the group could be easily defeated through police actions. Additionally, the president, &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Bela%C3%BAnde%20Terry\"&gt;Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry&lt;/a&gt;, who returned to power in 1980, was reluctant to cede authority to the armed forces since his first government had ended in a military &lt;a href=\"Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt;. The result was that the peasants in the areas where the Shining Path was active thought the state was either impotent or not interested in their issues.\nOn 29 December 1981, the government declared an \"emergency zone\" in the three Andean regions of Ayacucho, Huancavelica, and Apur\u00edmac and granted the &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Peru\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; the power to arbitrarily detain any suspicious person. The military abused this power, arresting scores of innocent people, at times subjecting them to torture during interrogation as well as rape. Members of the Peruvian Armed Forces began to wear black &lt;a href=\"Balaclava%20%28clothing%29\"&gt;ski-masks&lt;/a&gt; to hide their identities and protect their safety, and that of their families.\nIn some areas, the military trained peasants and organized them into anti-rebel militias, called \"&lt;a href=\"Ronda%20Campesina\"&gt;rondas&lt;/a&gt;\". They were generally poorly equipped, despite being provided arms by the state. The rondas would attack the Shining Path guerrillas, with the first such reported attack occurring in January 1983, near &lt;a href=\"Huata\"&gt;Huata&lt;/a&gt;. \"Ronderos\" would later kill 13 guerrilla fighters in February 1983, in &lt;a href=\"Sacsamarca\"&gt;Sacsamarca&lt;/a&gt;. In March 1983, \"ronderos\" brutally killed Olegario Curitomay, one of the commanders of the town of &lt;a href=\"Lucanamarca\"&gt;Lucanamarca&lt;/a&gt;. They took him to the town square, &lt;a href=\"stoning\"&gt;stoned&lt;/a&gt; him, &lt;a href=\"Stabbing\"&gt;stabbed&lt;/a&gt; him, set him on fire, and finally shot him. The Shining Path's retaliation to this was one of the worst attacks in the entire conflict, with a group of guerrilla members entering the town and going house by house, killing dozens of villagers, including babies, with guns, hatchets, and axes. This action has come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Lucanamarca%20massacre\"&gt;Lucanamarca massacre&lt;/a&gt;. Additional massacres of civilians by the Shining Path would occur throughout the conflict.\nThe Shining Path's attacks were not limited to the countryside. It executed several attacks against the infrastructure in &lt;a href=\"Lima\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt;, killing civilians in the process. In 1983, it sabotaged several electrical transmission towers, causing a citywide &lt;a href=\"Power%20outage\"&gt;blackout&lt;/a&gt;, and set fire and destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Bayer\"&gt;Bayer&lt;/a&gt; industrial plant. That same year, it set off a powerful bomb in the offices of the governing party, &lt;a href=\"Popular%20Action%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;Popular Action&lt;/a&gt;. Escalating its activities in Lima, in June 1985, it blew up electricity transmission towers in Lima, producing a blackout, and detonated &lt;a href=\"car%20bomb\"&gt;car bomb&lt;/a&gt;s near the government palace and the justice palace. It was believed to be responsible for bombing a shopping mall. At the time, President Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry was receiving the Argentine president &lt;a href=\"Ra%C3%BAl%20Alfons%C3%ADn\"&gt;Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this period, the Shining Path assassinated specific individuals, notably leaders of other leftist groups, local political parties, &lt;a href=\"Trade%20union\"&gt;labor unions&lt;/a&gt;, and peasant organizations, some of whom were anti-Shining Path &lt;a href=\"Marxism\"&gt;Marxists&lt;/a&gt;. On 24 April 1985, in the midst of presidential elections, it tried to assassinate Domingo Garc\u00eda Rada, the president of the Peruvian National Electoral Council, severely injuring him and mortally wounding his driver. In 1988, Constantin (Gus) Gregory, an American citizen working for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development\"&gt;United States Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;, was assassinated. Two French aid workers were killed on 4 December that same year.\nLevel of support.\nBy 1990, the Shining Path had about 3,000 armed members at its greatest extent. The group had gained control of much of the countryside of the center and south of Peru and had a large presence in the outskirts of Lima. The Shining Path began to fight against Peru's other major guerrilla group, the &lt;a href=\"T%C3%BApac%20Amaru%20Revolutionary%20Movement\"&gt;T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement&lt;/a&gt; (MRTA), as well as \"&lt;a href=\"Peasant\"&gt;campesino&lt;/a&gt;\" self-defense groups organized by the Peruvian armed forces.\nThe Shining Path quickly seized control of large areas of Peru. The group had significant support among peasant communities, and it had the support of some slum dwellers in the capital and elsewhere. The Shining Path's Maoism probably did not have the support of many city dwellers. According to opinion polls, only 15% of the population considered &lt;a href=\"Subversion%20%28politics%29\"&gt;subversion&lt;/a&gt; to be justifiable in June 1988, while only 17% considered it justifiable in 1991. In June 1991, \"the total sample disapproved of the Shining Path by an 83 to 7 percent margin, with 10 percent not answering the question. Among the poorest, however, only 58% stated disapproval of the Shining Path; 11 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the Shining Path, and some 31 percent would not answer the question.\" A September 1991 poll found that 21 percent of those polled in Lima believed that the Shining Path did not torture and kill innocent people. The same poll found that 13% believed that society would be more just if the Shining Path won the war and 22% believed society would be equally just under the Shining Path as it was under the government. Polls have never been completely accurate since Peru has several anti-terrorism laws, including \"apology for terrorism\", that makes it a punishable offense for anyone who does not condemn the Shining Path. In effect, the laws make it illegal to support the group in any way.\nMany peasants were unhappy with the Shining Path's rule for a variety of reasons, such as its disrespect for &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Peru\"&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt; culture and institutions. However, they had also made agreements and alliances with some indigenous tribes. Some did not like the brutality of its \"popular trials\" that sometimes included \"slitting throats, strangulation, stoning, and burning.\" Peasants were offended by the rebels' injunction against burying the bodies of Shining Path victims.\nThe Shining Path followed &lt;a href=\"Mao%20Zedong\"&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/a&gt;'s dictum that guerrilla warfare should start in the countryside and gradually choke off the cities. The Shining Path banned continuous drunkenness, but they did allow the consumption of alcohol.\nAccording to multiple sources, the Shining Path received support from &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Libya%20under%20Muammar%20Gaddafi\"&gt;Gaddafi's Libya&lt;/a&gt;.\n1990s: The Fujimori government.\nWhen President &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Fujimori\"&gt;Alberto Fujimori&lt;/a&gt; took office in 1990, he responded to Shining Path with repressive force. His government issued a law in 1991 that gave the \"rondas\" a legal status, and from that time, they were officially called \"Comit\u00e9s de auto defensa\" (\"Committees of Self-Defense\"). They were officially armed, usually with 12-gauge shotguns, and trained by the &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Army\"&gt;Peruvian Army&lt;/a&gt;. According to the government, there were approximately 7,226 \"comit\u00e9s de auto defensa\" as of 2005; almost 4,000 are located in the central region of Peru, the stronghold of the Shining Path.\nThe Peruvian government also cracked down on the Shining Path in other ways. Military personnel were dispatched to areas dominated by the Shining Path, especially &lt;a href=\"Ayacucho%20Region\"&gt;Ayacucho&lt;/a&gt;, to fight the rebels. Ayacucho, &lt;a href=\"Huancavelica%20Province\"&gt;Huancavelica&lt;/a&gt;, Apur\u00edmac and &lt;a href=\"Hu%C3%A1nuco%20Region\"&gt;Hu\u00e1nuco&lt;/a&gt; were declared emergency zones, allowing for some constitutional rights to be suspended in those areas.\nInitial government efforts to fight the Shining Path were not very effective or promising. Military units engaged in many human rights violations, which caused the Shining Path to appear in the eyes of many as the lesser of two evils. They used excessive force, tortured individuals accused of being sympathizers and killed many innocent civilians. Government forces destroyed villages and killed \"campesinos\" suspected of supporting the Shining Path. They eventually lessened the pace at which the armed forces committed atrocities such as massacres. Additionally, the state began the widespread use of intelligence agencies in its fight against the Shining Path. However, atrocities were committed by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Intelligence%20Service%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;National Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20Intelligence%20Service\"&gt;Army Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt;, notably the &lt;a href=\"La%20Cantuta%20massacre\"&gt;La Cantuta massacre&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Santa%20massacre\"&gt;Santa massacre&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrios%20Altos%20massacre\"&gt;Barrios Altos massacre&lt;/a&gt;, which were committed by &lt;a href=\"Grupo%20Colina\"&gt;Grupo Colina&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn one of its last attacks in Lima, on 16 July 1992, Shining Path &lt;a href=\"Tarata%20bombing\"&gt;detonated a powerful bomb on Tarata Street&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Miraflores%20District%2C%20Lima\"&gt;Miraflores District&lt;/a&gt;, full of civilian adults and children, killing 25 people and injuring an additional 155.\nCapture of Guzm\u00e1n and collapse.\nOn 12 September 1992, El Grupo Especial de Inteligencia (GEIN) captured Guzm\u00e1n and several Shining Path leaders in an apartment above a dance studio in the &lt;a href=\"Surquillo\"&gt;Surquillo&lt;/a&gt; district of Lima. GEIN had been monitoring the apartment since a number of suspected Shining Path militants had visited it. An inspection of the garbage of the apartment produced empty tubes of a skin cream used to treat &lt;a href=\"psoriasis\"&gt;psoriasis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that Guzm\u00e1n was known to have. Shortly after the raid that captured Guzm\u00e1n, most of the remaining Shining Path leadership fell as well.\nThe capture of rebel leader Abimael Guzm\u00e1n left a huge leadership vacuum for the Shining Path. \"There is no No. 2. There is only Presidente Gonzalo and then the party,\" a Shining Path political officer said at a birthday celebration for Guzm\u00e1n in Lurigancho prison in December 1990. \"Without Presidente Gonzalo, we would have nothing.\"\nAt the same time, the Shining Path suffered embarrassing military defeats to self-defense organizations of rural \"campesinos\" \u2014 supposedly its social base. When Guzm\u00e1n called for peace talks with the Peruvian government, the organization fractured into splinter groups, with some Shining Path members in favor of such talks and others opposed. \nGuzm\u00e1n's role as the leader of the Shining Path was taken over by &lt;a href=\"%C3%93scar%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20%28terrorist%29\"&gt;\u00d3scar Ram\u00edrez&lt;/a&gt;, who himself was captured by Peruvian authorities in 1999. After Ram\u00edrez's capture, the group further splintered, guerrilla activity diminished sharply, and peace returned to the areas where the Shining Path had been active. The two remaining splinter groups were a collective in &lt;a href=\"Huallaga%20Valley\"&gt;Huallaga Valley&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Comrade%20Artemio\"&gt;Comrade Artemio&lt;/a&gt; and the Militarized Communist Party of Peru (MPCP) led by the V\u00edctor and Jorge Quispe Palomino brothers.\n2000s: Temporary resurgence.\nAlthough the organization's numbers had lessened by 2003, a militant faction of the Shining Path called \"Proseguir\" (\"Onward\") continued to be active. The group had allegedly made an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (FARC) in the early 2000s, learning how to use rockets against aircraft.\nOn 20 March 2002, a &lt;a href=\"2002%20Lima%20bombing\"&gt;car bomb exploded outside the US embassy in Lima&lt;/a&gt; just before a visit by President &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. Nine people were killed, and 30 were injured; the attack was suspected to be the work of the Shining Path.\nOn 9 June 2003, a Shining Path group attacked a camp in Ayacucho and took 68 employees of the Argentinian company &lt;a href=\"Techint\"&gt;Techint&lt;/a&gt; and three police guards as hostages. They had been working on the &lt;a href=\"Camisea%20Gas%20Project\"&gt;Camisea gas pipeline project&lt;/a&gt; that would take natural gas from &lt;a href=\"Cusco%20Region\"&gt;Cusco&lt;/a&gt; to Lima. According to sources from Peru's Interior Ministry, the rebels asked for a sizable ransom to free the hostages. Two days later, after a rapid military response which involved a &lt;a href=\"signals%20intelligence\"&gt;signals intelligence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Embraer%20R-99\"&gt;aircraft&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Brazilian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, the rebels abandoned the hostages; according to government sources, no ransom was paid. However, there were rumors that US$200,000 was paid to the rebels.\nGovernment forces have captured three leading Shining Path members. In April 2000, Commander &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Arcela%20Chiroque\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Arcela Chiroque&lt;/a&gt;, called \"Orme\u00f1o\", was captured, followed by another leader, Florentino Cerr\u00f3n Cardozo, called \"Marcelo\", in July 2003. In November of the same year, Jaime Zu\u00f1iga, called \"Cirilo\" or \"Dalton\", was arrested after a clash in which four guerrillas were killed and an officer was wounded. Officials said he took part in planning the kidnapping of the Techint pipeline workers. He was also thought to have led an ambush against an army helicopter in 1999 in which five soldiers died.\nIn 2003, the Peruvian National Police broke up several Shining Path training camps and captured many members and leaders. By late October 2003, there were 96 terrorist incidents in Peru, projecting a 15% decrease from the 134 kidnappings and armed attacks in 2002. Also for the year, eight or nine people were killed by the Shining Path, and 6 \"senderistas\" were killed and 209 were captured.\nIn January 2004, a man known as &lt;a href=\"Comrade%20Artemio\"&gt;Comrade Artemio&lt;/a&gt; and identifying himself as one of the Shining Path's leaders, said in a media interview that the group would resume violent operations unless the Peruvian government granted amnesty to other top Shining Path leaders within 60 days. Peru's Interior Minister, Fernando Rospigliosi, said that the government would respond \"drastically and swiftly\" to any violent action. In September that same year, a comprehensive sweep by police in five cities found 17 suspected members. According to the interior minister, eight of the arrested were school teachers and high-level school administrators.\nDespite these arrests, the Shining Path continued to exist in Peru. On 22 December 2005, the Shining Path ambushed a police patrol in the &lt;a href=\"Hu%C3%A1nuco%20Region\"&gt;Hu\u00e1nuco region&lt;/a&gt;, killing eight. Later that day, they wounded an additional two police officers. In response, then President &lt;a href=\"Alejandro%20Toledo\"&gt;Alejandro Toledo&lt;/a&gt; declared a state of emergency in Hu\u00e1nuco and gave the police the power to search houses and arrest suspects without a warrant. On 19 February 2006, the Peruvian police killed H\u00e9ctor Aponte, believed to be the commander responsible for the ambush. In December 2006, Peruvian troops were sent to counter renewed guerrilla activity, and according to high-level government officials, the Shining Path's strength has reached an estimated 300 members. In November 2007, police said they killed Artemio's second-in-command, a guerrilla known as JL.\nIn September 2008, government forces announced the killing of five rebels in the &lt;a href=\"Vizcatan\"&gt;Vizcatan&lt;/a&gt; region. This claim was subsequently challenged by the &lt;a href=\"APRODEH\"&gt;APRODEH&lt;/a&gt;, a Peruvian human rights group, which believed that those who were killed were in fact local farmers and not rebels. That same month, Artemio gave his first recorded interview since 2006. In it, he stated that the Shining Path would continue to fight despite escalating military pressure. In October 2008, in &lt;a href=\"Huancavelica%20Region\"&gt;Huancavelica Region&lt;/a&gt;, the guerrillas engaged a military convoy with explosives and firearms, demonstrating their continued ability to strike and inflict casualties on military targets. The conflict resulted in the death of 12 soldiers and two to seven civilians. It came one day after a clash in the Vizcatan region, which left five rebels and one soldier dead.\nIn November 2008, the rebels utilized hand grenades and automatic weapons in an assault that claimed the lives of 4 police officers. In April 2009, the Shining Path ambushed and killed 13 government soldiers in Ayacucho. Grenades and dynamite were used in the attack. The dead included eleven soldiers and one captain, and two soldiers were also injured, with one reported missing. Poor communications were said to have made relay of the news difficult. The country's Defense Minister, &lt;a href=\"Antero%20Flores%20Ar%C3%A1oz\"&gt;Antero Flores Ar\u00e1oz&lt;/a&gt;, said many soldiers \"plunged over a cliff\". His Prime Minister, &lt;a href=\"Yehude%20Simon\"&gt;Yehude Simon&lt;/a&gt;, said these attacks were \"desperate responses by the Shining Path in the face of advances by the armed forces\" and expressed his belief that the area would soon be freed of \"leftover terrorists\". In the aftermath, a Sendero leader called this \"the strongest [anti-government] blow... in quite a while\". In November 2009, Defense Minister &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Rey\"&gt;Rafael Rey&lt;/a&gt; announced that Shining Path militants had attacked a military outpost in southern Ayacucho province. One soldier was killed and three others wounded in the assault.\n2010s: Capture of Artemio and continued downfall.\nOn 28 April 2010, Shining Path rebels in Peru ambushed and killed a police officer and two civilians who were destroying coca plantations of Aucayacu, in the central region of Haunuco, Peru. The victims were gunned down by sniper fire coming from the thick forest as more than 200 workers were destroying coca plants. Following the attack, the Shining Path faction, based in the Upper Huallaga Valley of Peru and headed by Florindo Eleuterio Flores Hala, alias Comrade Artemio, was operating in survival mode and lost 9 of their top 10 leaders to Peruvian National Police-led capture operations. Two of the eight leaders were killed by PNP personnel during the attempted captures. The nine arrested or killed Shining Path (Upper Huallaga Valley faction) leaders include Mono (Aug. 2009), Rub\u00e9n (May 2010), Izula (Oct. 2010), Sergio (Dec. 2010), Yoli/Miguel/Jorge (Jun. 2011), Gato Larry (Jun. 2011), Oscar Tigre (Aug. 2011), Vicente Roger (Aug. 2011), and Dante/Delta (Jan. 2012). This loss of leadership, coupled with a sweep of Shining Path (Upper Huallaga Valley) supporters executed by the PNP in November 2010, prompted Comrade Artemio to declare in December 2011 to several international journalists that the guerrilla war against the Peruvian Government has been lost and that his only hope was to negotiate an amnesty agreement with the Government of Peru.\nOn 12 February 2012, Comrade Artemio was found badly wounded after a clash with troops in a remote jungle region of Peru. President &lt;a href=\"Ollanta%20Humala\"&gt;Ollanta Humala&lt;/a&gt; said the capture of Artemio marked the defeat of the Shining Path in the Alto Huallaga valley \u2013 a center of cocaine production. President Humala has stated that he would now step up the fight against the remaining bands of Shining Path rebels in the Ene-Apur\u00edmac valley. Walter Diaz, the lead candidate to succeed Artemio, was captured on 3 March, further ensuring the disintegration of the Alto Huallaga valley faction. On 3 April 2012, Jaime Arenas Caviedes, a senior leader in the group's remnants in Alto Huallaga Valley who was also regarded to be the leading candidate to succeed Artemio following Diaz's arrest, was captured. After Caviedes, alias \"Braulio\", was captured, Humala declared that the Shining Path was now unable to operate in the Alto Huallaga Valley. Shining Path rebels carried out an attack on three helicopters being used by an international gas pipeline consortium on 7 October, in the central region of Cusco. According to the military Joint Command spokesman, Col. Alejandro Lujan, no one was kidnapped or injured during the attack. The capture of Artemio effectively ended the war between Shining Path and the Government of Peru.\nComrade Artemio was convicted of terrorism, drug trafficking, and money laundering on 7 June 2013. He was sentenced to life in prison and a fine of $183\u00a0million. On 11 August 2013, &lt;a href=\"Comrade%20Alipio\"&gt;Comrade Alipio&lt;/a&gt;, the Shining Path's leader in the Ene-Apur\u00edmac Valley, was killed in a battle with government forces in Llochegua. \nOn 9 April 2016, on the eve of &lt;a href=\"2016%20Peruvian%20general%20election\"&gt;the country's presidential elections&lt;/a&gt;, the Peruvian government blamed remnants of the Shining Path for a guerilla attack that killed eight soldiers and two civilians. Shining Path snipers killed three police officers in the Ene Apurimac Valley on 18 March 2017.\nIn a document 400 pages in length recovered from a mid-level Shining Path commander and analyzed by the Counter-Terrorism Directorate (DIRCOTE) of the National Police, the Shining Path planned to initiate operations against the Government of Peru that included killings and surprise attacks beginning in 2021, the bicentennial of Peru's independence. Objectives were created to first attack public officials, then regain lost territory and then finally overthrow the government.\n2020s: VRAEM stronghold.\nInto the 2020s, Shining Path has existed in remaining splinter groups. The last remaining group, called the &lt;a href=\"Militarized%20Communist%20Party%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Militarized Communist Party of Peru&lt;/a&gt; (MPCP) of about 450 individuals remained in the &lt;a href=\"Valle%20de%20los%20R%C3%ADos%20Apur%C3%ADmac%2C%20Ene%20y%20Mantaro\"&gt;Valle de los R\u00edos Apur\u00edmac, Ene y Mantaro&lt;/a&gt; (VRAEM) region, reportedly making revenue by escorting cocaine traffickers and are reportedly led by two brothers; V\u00edctor and &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Quispe%20Palomino\"&gt;Jorge Quispe Palomino&lt;/a&gt;. The MPCP has attempted to recharacterize themselves to distance itself from the original Shining Path groups that had attacked rural communities in the area, describing Abimael Guzman as a traitor. According to &lt;a href=\"InSight%20Crime\"&gt;InSight Crime&lt;/a&gt;, Shining Path's stronghold in the VRAEM, headquartered in Vizcat\u00e1n, is a similar strategy as the &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; .\nFollowing a five-year intelligence operation that began in 2015 and was codenamed Operation Olimpo, 71 alleged members of the Shining Path's United Front and People's Guerrilla Army were arrested on 2 December 2020. Alfredo Crespo, the secretary general of MOVADEF and Guzm\u00e1n's former lawyer, was included among those arrested. Operation Olimpo included 752 military personnel and 98 government prosecutors that utilized evidence obtained through wiretapping, undercover agents and surveillance. Those arrested were charged with operating shell operations to initiate terrorist activities in Callao and Lima.\nIdeology and practices.\nThe official ideology of the Shining Path ceased to be \"Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Mao Tse-tung thought\" and it was instead referred to as \"Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism\u2013Gonzalo thought\" - according to some authors as the organization grew in power, a &lt;a href=\"cult%20of%20personality\"&gt;cult of personality&lt;/a&gt; grew around Guzm\u00e1n.\nAnti-LGBT.\nThe Shining Path has reportedly instituted &lt;a href=\"violence%20against%20LGBT%20people\"&gt;violence against LGBT people&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1989 and 1992, the Shining Path and the MRTA allegedly killed up to 500 \"non-heterosexual\" people. According to one woman who was kidnapped by the Shining Path in 1981, a homosexual man's penis was cut into pieces before he was murdered. The Peruvian government did not reveal the name of the victim. The Shining Path defended its actions by saying that LGBT individuals were not killed because of their sexual identity, instead, they were killed because of their \"degrading and promiscuous practices\" and \"the people\" requested that they be executed. These reported killings continued throughout the twentieth century.\nUse of violence.\nAlthough the reliability of reports regarding the Shining Path's actions remains a matter of controversy in Peru, the organization's use of violence is well documented. According to &lt;a href=\"InSight%20Crime\"&gt;InSight Crime&lt;/a&gt;, Shining Path would kill their opponents \"with assassinations, bombings, &lt;a href=\"beheadings\"&gt;beheadings&lt;/a&gt; and massacres\" as well as \"&lt;a href=\"stoning\"&gt;stoning&lt;/a&gt; victims to death, or &lt;a href=\"Death%20by%20boiling\"&gt;placing them in boiling water&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Shining Path rejected the concept of human rights; a Shining Path document stated:\nAfter the collapse of the Fujimori government, interim President &lt;a href=\"Valent%C3%ADn%20Paniagua\"&gt;Valent\u00edn Paniagua&lt;/a&gt; established a &lt;a href=\"Truth%20and%20Reconciliation%20Commission%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;Truth and Reconciliation Commission&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the conflict. The Commission found in its 2003 \"Final Report\" that 69,280 people died or &lt;a href=\"Forced%20disappearance\"&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt; between 1980 and 2000 as a result of the armed conflict. The Shining Path was found to be responsible for about 54% of the deaths and disappearances reported to the commission. A statistical analysis of the available data led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to estimate that the Shining Path was responsible for the death or disappearance of 31,331 people, 46% of the total deaths and disappearances. According to a summary of the report by &lt;a href=\"Human%20Rights%20Watch\"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;, \"Shining Path... killed about half the victims, and roughly one-third died at the hands of government security forces... The commission attributed some of the other slayings to a smaller guerrilla group and local militias. The rest remain unattributed.\" The MRTA was held responsible for 1.5% of the deaths. A 2019 study disputed the casualty figures from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, estimating instead \"a total of 48,000 killings, substantially lower than the TRC estimate\", and concluding that \"the Peruvian State accounts for a significantly larger share than the Shining Path.\"\nPopular culture.\nAmerican hard rock band &lt;a href=\"Guns%20N%27%20Roses\"&gt;Guns N' Roses&lt;/a&gt; quotes a speech by a Shining Path officer in their 1990 song \"&lt;a href=\"Civil%20War%20%28song%29\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;\", as saying \"We practice selective annihilation of mayors and government officials, for example, to create a vacuum, then we fill that vacuum. As popular war advances, peace is closer.\""
