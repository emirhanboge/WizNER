He added that both countries shared common interests and shouldered a \"special and important responsibility in upholding world peace. I highly value China-U.S. relations and am looking forward to working with you to expand cooperation in all fields, including in bilateral, regional and global aspects.\" He says he expects they would \"manage differences in a constructive way, in the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect, cooperation and win-win.\" In a phone conversation with Trump, Xi said that cooperation was \"the only correct choice.\" A statement from Trump's presidential transition office read that \"the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another.\"\nIndia.\n&lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20India\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Narendra%20Modi\"&gt;Narendra Modi&lt;/a&gt; congratulated Trump and wrote that \"we appreciated the friendship you have articulated toward India during your campaign.\" He added that he looks forward to working with him.

He added, in reference to Trump's administration possibly distancing the US from the rest of the world, that: \"The position of the United States has been weakened within the international community and in the world's public opinion as a result of wrongful policies, and a wider gap with the global community and Europe will further harm that position.\" He also said that the US could not spread Iranophobia as forcefully anymore in order to get international consensus against Iran. \"The Islamic Republic's policy of constructive interaction with the world and breaking up nuclear sanctions, has placed Iran's economic ties with all countries on an improving and irreversible course.\" He noted that the &lt;a href=\"JCPOA\"&gt;JCPOA&lt;/a&gt; was an agreement with one country or government but was approved by the &lt;a href=\"UN%20Security%20Council%20Resolution\"&gt;UN Security Council Resolution&lt;/a&gt; and thus could not be overturned unilaterally.\nIsrael.\n&lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Israel\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reuven%20Rivlin\"&gt;Reuven Rivlin&lt;/a&gt; congratulated Trump.

The president also said that he support Trump's policy of \"no-interference\" on other countries affairs. He added \"Today, America elected its new President. The strongest policy he has announced so far is to stop America's efforts to meddle in global affairs. America needs to stop policing the entire world. This, without a doubt, is a very good principle\".\nMyanmar.\nPresident's office deputy-director and spokesman for &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Myanmar\"&gt;Myanmar president&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Htin%20Kyaw\"&gt;Htin Kyaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zaw%20Htay\"&gt;Zaw Htay&lt;/a&gt; said: \"I believe that the &lt;a href=\"Myanmar-United%20States%20relations\"&gt;relationship between the U.S.A. and Burma (Myanmar)&lt;/a&gt; can only get better under President Trump.\" Following Trump's win, Zaw congratulated him on \"Facebook\" by writing: \"Best wishes for you to make America Great Again!\"\nNorth Korea.\nKim Yong Ho, director of human rights and humanitarian issues, stated on behalf of the country, \"We do not care about whoever becomes the president of the United States, the fundamental issue here is whether or not the United States has the political will to withdraw its &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations\"&gt;hostile policy toward the DPRK&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPakistan.\n&lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nawaz%20Sharif\"&gt;Nawaz Sharif&lt;/a&gt; congratulated Trump on his \"historic victory.\" Sharif stated: \"On behalf of the government and people of Pakistan, and on my own behalf, I wish to extend to you and the people of the United States, our most sincere felicitations on your election as the 45th president of the United States.

Carlo Kooktapeh Ganjeh of the US chapter of the Assyrian Universal Alliance also said: \"I extend our heartfelt congratulations to you for your election as the President of the United States,\"\nEuropean Union.\n&lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20European%20Council\"&gt;President of the European Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Tusk\"&gt;Donald Tusk&lt;/a&gt; congratulated Trump and invited him to an EU-US summit to improve co-operation.\nISIS.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant\"&gt;Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant&lt;/a&gt; (ISIL/ISIS) reportedly celebrated Trump's victory, claiming it would help strengthen recruitment and writing \"Rejoice with support from &lt;a href=\"Allah\"&gt;Allah&lt;/a&gt;, and find glad tidings in the imminent demise of America at the hands of Trump.\"\nNATO.\n&lt;a href=\"Secretary%20General%20of%20NATO\"&gt;Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jens%20Stoltenberg\"&gt;Jens Stoltenberg&lt;/a&gt;, whose organization Trump has said was \"obsolete\" during the campaign, said:\nUS leadership is as important as ever. Our Alliance has brought together America's closest friends in times of peace and of conflict for almost 70 years. A strong NATO is good for the United States, and good for Europe. We face a challenging new security environment, including hybrid warfare, cyber attacks, the threat of terrorism. NATO has responded with determination to the new security situation. But we have more work to do. And I look forward to meeting Mr. Trump soon, and welcoming him to Brussels for the NATO Summit next year to discuss the way forward.\nHe added: \"NATO's security guarantee is a treaty commitment and all allies have made a solemn commitment to defend each other and this is something which is absolute and unconditioned.\" He reminded that NATO was part of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom\"&gt;Operation Enduring Freedom&lt;/a&gt; and that NATO \"is important both for collective defence in Europe and to provide help and play a role in the fight against international terrorism.\"\nFinancial markets.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20peso\"&gt;Mexican peso&lt;/a&gt; rallied in the day before the election on speculation Trump would lose over his alleged anti-Mexican comments, while the stock markets of the world also rallied on speculation Clinton would win. The price of gold, in turn, dropped after days of increasing for the same reason.\nAfter the result, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20dollar\"&gt;US dollar&lt;/a&gt; and stock markets initially sank, especially in the Asia\u2013Pacific region which was open as the result came in. In like measure, traditional safe haven assets such as sovereign bonds and gold were higher. The Mexican peso fell about 13 percent. &lt;a href=\"Dow%20Jones%20futures\"&gt;Dow Jones futures&lt;/a&gt; also fell about 3 percent. The day after the election, however, the Dow Jones rose 257 points despite the \"knee-jerk reaction\" of the night before. The Dow Jones continued to rise over the week, and on November 10 it reached a record high, experiencing its best week since 2011. However, unlike most other global markets, Russia's &lt;a href=\"MICEX\"&gt;MICEX&lt;/a&gt; rose after the result.\nIn the weeks following the election, as Trump gradually formed his pro-business &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Donald%20Trump\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt;, US stock markets rallied strongly and the &lt;a href=\"Dow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average\"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; flirted with the 20,000-point level. The US dollar also gained significant value.\nMedia.\nOn November 10 the \"&lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Star\"&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that the website of &lt;a href=\"Immigration%2C%20Refugees%20and%20Citizenship%20Canada\"&gt;Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada&lt;/a&gt; crashed when it was flooded with a large increase in traffic on election night. The increase in traffic was said to be 5 times larger than normal, and the percent of requests coming from the United States increased from the normal ten percent to fifty percent of all requests.\nNorth Korea's \"&lt;a href=\"Rodong%20Sinmun\"&gt;Rodong Sinmun&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote: \"It has burdened the new administration with the difficulty of facing the Juche nuclear state,\" referring to the North Korean state ideology often translated as \"self-reliance.\" The article did not mention Trump by name, but declared \"it was high time\" that the US took action to resolve tensions on the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Peninsula\"&gt;Korean Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. The editorial maintained that North Korea would never give up its nuclear weapons and referred to comments made last month by US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who called efforts to denuclearize North Korea a \"lost cause.\" The publication declared Washington plans \"an outdated illusion.\"\nAcademia.\n\"Oraib Rantawi, head of Al Quds Centre for Political Studies, said Jordan is one of the 'very few' countries that are not worried about who is the US President, as the Kingdom has maintained 'a very stable and wise relationship' with the US administration regardless of who has been in the Oval Office.\" Mauritian economist Rajiv Seervansingh suggested a Donald Trump administration would have both a direct and an indirect impact on the Mauritian economy and stated:\nNothing as such will change with Donald Trump being the President of the USA. We mostly deal with the USA via the AGOA. There is no direct threat to our economy. Exportations through the AGOA will continue. We still need to figure out Trump's political and economic policies. If the President-elect decides to scrap the various deals on imports, it will have a negative impact on international trade. Then Mauritius might be affected by this. If the dollar depreciates, exports will suffer as exporters will get less revenue.\nReligious.\n&lt;a href=\"Justin%20Welby\"&gt;Justin Welby&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; and symbolic head of the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Communion\"&gt;Anglican Communion&lt;/a&gt;, called for \"reconciliation\" and he also pledged to \"pray for all the people of the United States.\" &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20Kirill%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Patriarch Kirill of Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Russian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;, offered \"heartfelt congratulations\" to Trump and a hope that he would bring change to American domestic and foreign policy.\nOthers.\nResidents of Trump's ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"Kallstadt\"&gt;Kallstadt&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, have expressed negative opinions of him. People from Melania Trump's hometown of &lt;a href=\"Novo%20Mesto\"&gt;Novo Mesto&lt;/a&gt;, Slovenia, congratulated her for becoming the &lt;a href=\"First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;first lady of the United States&lt;/a&gt;. International protests against the election of Trump have occurred in Great Britain, the Philippines, Germany, Canada, Belgium and Australia."
