It straddles northern Chester County and southern Berks County along &lt;a href=\"French%20Creek%20%28Schuylkill%20River%29\"&gt;French Creek&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the &lt;a href=\"Hopewell%20Big%20Woods\"&gt;Hopewell Big Woods&lt;/a&gt;. The park is the home of two lakes: &lt;a href=\"Hopewell%20Lake\"&gt;Hopewell Lake&lt;/a&gt;, a warm water lake, and &lt;a href=\"Scotts%20Run%20Lake\"&gt;Scotts Run Lake&lt;/a&gt;, a cold water lake. The state record &lt;a href=\"smallmouth%20bass\"&gt;smallmouth bass&lt;/a&gt; was caught in Scotts Run Lake. There are extensive forests, and almost of &lt;a href=\"hiking\"&gt;hiking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Equestrianism\"&gt;equestrian&lt;/a&gt; trails. The park is also friendly to &lt;a href=\"mountain%20bike\"&gt;mountain bike&lt;/a&gt;rs, having some renowned technical trails. &lt;a href=\"Hopewell%20Furnace%20National%20Historic%20Site\"&gt;Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site&lt;/a&gt;, which features a &lt;a href=\"cold%20blast\"&gt;cold blast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; restored to its 1830s appearance, is surrounded by the park. The Six Penny Day Use Area and Group Camp are listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;. French Creek State Park is located off of &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Route%20345\"&gt;Pennsylvania Route 345&lt;/a&gt; to the south of &lt;a href=\"Birdsboro%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Birdsboro&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrench Creek State Park was chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Conservation%20and%20Natural%20Resources\"&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; (DCNR) and its &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Bureau%20of%20State%20Parks\"&gt;Bureau of State Parks&lt;/a&gt; as one of \"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\".\nHistory.\nThe land in and surrounding French Creek State Park was once dominated by &lt;a href=\"old-growth%20forest\"&gt;old-growth forest&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"American%20chestnut\"&gt;American chestnut&lt;/a&gt;. These trees were cleared, beginning in 1771, and used to make &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; to feed the iron furnace at nearby &lt;a href=\"Hopewell%20Furnace\"&gt;Hopewell Furnace&lt;/a&gt;. The forests were allowed to regrow and were cleared again approximately every twenty-five years. The furnace was in operation for 112 years until 1883. The damage caused by the &lt;a href=\"Charcoal%20maker\"&gt;colliers&lt;/a&gt; had a long-lasting effect on the &lt;a href=\"ecology\"&gt;ecology&lt;/a&gt; of this section of southeastern Pennsylvania. The thickly wooded hillsides that once provided a &lt;a href=\"habitat%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;habitat&lt;/a&gt; for a wide variety of woodland creatures were stripped bare. But the forest slowly began to grow back.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20forest\"&gt;second growth forest&lt;/a&gt;s that stand today at French Creek State Park are made up of a mixture of &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"maple\"&gt;maple&lt;/a&gt; and other mostly hardwood trees. The land was reclaimed by the efforts of the young men of the &lt;a href=\"Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps\"&gt;Civilian Conservation Corps&lt;/a&gt; created during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; by President &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; to offset unemployment. The CCC, invited to Pennsylvania by Governor &lt;a href=\"Gifford%20Pinchot\"&gt;Gifford Pinchot&lt;/a&gt;, worked to clear the forests and streams of brush. They also built many of the facilities still in use today at the park, including several tent &lt;a href=\"camping\"&gt;camping&lt;/a&gt; areas, two small &lt;a href=\"dam\"&gt;dam&lt;/a&gt;s and lakes, two group camps, picnic areas, and extensive roads and trails throughout the park. They also began the restoration of the historic Hopewell Furnace.\nRecreation.\nHunting and fishing.\nHunting is permitted on over of French Creek State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Game%20Commission\"&gt;Pennsylvania Game Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The common game species are &lt;a href=\"common%20pheasant\"&gt;pheasant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"eastern%20gray%20squirrel\"&gt;squirrels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wild%20turkey\"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"white-tailed%20deer\"&gt;white-tailed deer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"eastern%20cottontail\"&gt;rabbits&lt;/a&gt;. The hunting of &lt;a href=\"groundhog\"&gt;groundhog&lt;/a&gt;s is not permitted at the park.\nThe lakes at French Creek State Park offer two varieties of fishing. Scotts Run Lake is a cold water fishery. It is &lt;a href=\"fish%20stocking\"&gt;stocked&lt;/a&gt; with trout by the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Fish%20and%20Boat%20Commission\"&gt;Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission&lt;/a&gt;. Hopewell Lake is a warm water fishery. The common game fish caught in the lake are &lt;a href=\"muskellunge\"&gt;muskellunge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"walleye\"&gt;walleye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"northern%20pike\"&gt;northern pike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chain%20pickerel\"&gt;chain pickerel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"largemouth%20bass\"&gt;largemouth&lt;/a&gt;, pan fish, and smallmouth bass. Both lakes are open to &lt;a href=\"ice%20fishing\"&gt;ice fishing&lt;/a&gt;, weather permitting. Bait &amp; tackle are available for sale near the rest rooms by the boat launch at Hopewell Lake.\nBoating and swimming.\nGas powered boats are prohibited in the lakes of French Creek State Park. All non powered and electric powered boats must have a current registration with any state or a launch permit for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.\nThe lakes are not open to swimming. A pool at nearby Hopewell Lake is open daily from 11:00am until 7:00pm from &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20Day\"&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/a&gt; weekend through &lt;a href=\"Labor%20Day\"&gt;Labor Day&lt;/a&gt; weekend.\nDisc golf and orienteering.\nOne &lt;a href=\"disc%20golf\"&gt;disc golf&lt;/a&gt; course is open year-round at the park. The course winds through the woods near Hopewell Lake and provides both short and long pin locations. Score cards and maps of the course are available at the park.\nThere is a permanent Orienteering course that begins and ends near the boat launch area. Maps are available at the park office. Orienteering events are held at the park by the Delaware Valley Orienteering Association about 3 times a year. More data on local Orienteering events can be found at http://www.dvoa.org\nTrails.\nFrench Creek State Park has more than of trails that are open to hiking and in some places horseback riding, mountain biking, and &lt;a href=\"cross-country%20skiing\"&gt;cross-country skiing&lt;/a&gt;.\nStaying overnight.\nVisitors to the park have three options for overnight accommodations.

The facilities include dining halls, central washhouses, and cabins for campers and staff.\nForest fires.\nOn April 9, 2012, a forest fire started on the eastern side of &lt;a href=\"Hopewell%20Furnace%20National%20Historic%20Site\"&gt;Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site&lt;/a&gt; due to fallen tree onto a powerline during an unusually warm and dry spring. The fire followed an unusual &lt;a href=\"2011%20Halloween%20nor%27easter\"&gt;October ice and snowstorm&lt;/a&gt; that caused tree limb damage. This caused the forest to become a \"tinderbox,\" according to officials. The fire burned approximately 750 acres, largely contained within the park. The forest fire caused the park's trails east of Rt. 345 and south of Shed Road to be closed. It also caused numerous evacuations around the eastern and southern edges of the park, though the fire never damaged any homes. This was the longest, largest, and most expensive fire operation in the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry's history. The fire was officially declared extinguished on April 23, 2012, two weeks after the fire began.\nA forest fire was spotted in the park on April 1, 2016, almost four years after the previous fire and in the same approximate location. The fire was reported to have burned at least nine acres south of Miller's Point.\nNearby state parks.\nThe following state parks are within of French Creek State Park:"
