    "text": "The Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (Transcaucasian SFSR or TSFSR), also known as the Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, or simply Transcaucasia, was a &lt;a href=\"Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; that existed from 1922 to 1936. \nThe TSFSR comprised &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, traditionally known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Transcaucasia\"&gt;Transcaucasia&lt;/a&gt;n Republics\" as they were separated from &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Caucasus%20Mountains\"&gt;Caucasus Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The TSFSR was one of the four republics to sign the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20on%20the%20Creation%20of%20the%20USSR\"&gt;Treaty on the Creation of the USSR&lt;/a&gt; establishing the Soviet Union in 1922. The TSFSR was created ostensibly to consolidate the economic situation and &lt;a href=\"Bolsheviks\"&gt;Bolshevik&lt;/a&gt; control over the region. The TSFSR was dissolved upon the adoption of the &lt;a href=\"1936%20Constitution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;1936 Soviet Constitution&lt;/a&gt; and its constituent republics were elevated individually to republics of the Soviet Union.\nHistory.\nThe roots of a Transcaucasian condominium state trace back to the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 1918, following the &lt;a href=\"October%20Revolution\"&gt;October Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, when the provinces of the &lt;a href=\"Caucasus\"&gt;Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; seceded and formed their own state called the &lt;a href=\"Transcaucasian%20Democratic%20Federative%20Republic\"&gt;Transcaucasian Federation&lt;/a&gt;. Competing ethno-national interests and confrontation with the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; led to the dissolution of the Transcaucasian Federation only two months later, in April 1918.\nThe three successor states: the &lt;a href=\"First%20Republic%20of%20Armenia\"&gt;First Republic of Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Azerbaijan\"&gt;Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;Democratic Republic of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, lasted until the end of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Russian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; that was being fought across the mountains, when they were invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sovietization\"&gt;sovietized&lt;/a&gt;. Following the proposal by &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Lenin\"&gt;Vladimir Lenin&lt;/a&gt; the three now Soviet Republics, the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20SSR\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijani%20SSR\"&gt;Azerbaijani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Georgian SSR&lt;/a&gt;s, were united into the Federative Union of Socialist Soviet Republics of Transcaucasia on 12 March 1922. On 13 December that year, the First &lt;a href=\"All-Caucasian%20Congress%20of%20Soviets\"&gt;All-Caucasian Congress of Soviets&lt;/a&gt; transformed this \"federation of states\" into a unified \"&lt;a href=\"federal%20state\"&gt;federal state&lt;/a&gt;\" and renamed it into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, though keeping formally the autonomy of its constituent republics. The congress also adopted the constitution, appointed the &lt;a href=\"All-Caucasian%20Central%20Executive%20Committee\"&gt;Central Executive Committee&lt;/a&gt; (the highest legislative body between congressional sessions), and the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20People%27s%20Commissars\"&gt;Council of People's Commissars&lt;/a&gt; (the government). &lt;a href=\"Mamia%20Orakhelashvili\"&gt;Mamia Orakhelashvili&lt;/a&gt;, a Georgian &lt;a href=\"Bolsheviks\"&gt;Bolshevik&lt;/a&gt; leader, became the first chairman of the Transcaucasian SFSR's Council of People's Commissars. &lt;a href=\"Tbilisi\"&gt;Tbilisi&lt;/a&gt; was the capital of the republic.\nThe republic became a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; on 30 December along with the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Socialist%20Federal%20Soviet%20Republic\"&gt;Russian SFSR&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Ukrainian SSR&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Belorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Belorussian SSR&lt;/a&gt;. In December 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved and divided again among the Georgian, Armenian and Azerbaijani SSRs.\nAutonomous republics within TSFSR.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army%20invasion%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;Red Army invasion of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abkhazia\"&gt;Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt;, hitherto an autonomous province within the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;Democratic Republic of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, was declared a Soviet Republic, the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Soviet%20Republic%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;SSR of Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt;, in March 1921 by the Abkhaz &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20committee%20%28Soviet%20Union%29\"&gt;Revolutionary committee&lt;/a&gt;. However the republic's relations with Georgia and Russia were not formally settled. On December 16, 1921, Abkhazia signed a treaty of alliance with the Georgian SSR, which defined its status as a \"treaty republic\" (Russian: \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430) and established a military, political and financial union between the two Soviet republics, subordinating the SSR of Abkhazia to the Georgian SSR. Thus, through Georgia, Abkhazia joined the TSFSR and was initially on an equal footing with the other republics of the federation. On February 19, 1931, Abkhazia's republican status was downgraded to that of an &lt;a href=\"Abkhaz%20ASSR\"&gt;Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic&lt;/a&gt; within the Georgian SSR.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Adjar%20ASSR\"&gt;Adjar ASSR&lt;/a&gt; was established on July 16, 1921 within the Georgian SSR as a consequence of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Kars\"&gt;Treaty of Kars&lt;/a&gt;. The treaty marking the end of the &lt;a href=\"Caucasus%20Campaign\"&gt;Caucasus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; provided for the division of the former &lt;a href=\"Batum%20Oblast\"&gt;Batum Oblast&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kutais%20Governorate\"&gt;Kutais Governorate&lt;/a&gt; of the Russian Empire between Georgia and Turkey. According to the agreement the northern half with significant Georgian Muslim population would become part of the Soviet Georgia but granted autonomy.\nAnother autonomous republic was established in July 1920 in &lt;a href=\"Nakhchivan%20Autonomous%20Republic\"&gt;Nakhchivan&lt;/a&gt;, an area bordering Armenia, Turkey and Iran, which was claimed by Armenians and Azerbaijanis. After the occupation of the region by the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nakhchivan%20Autonomous%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic&lt;/a&gt; was declared with \"close ties\" to the Azerbaijani SSR. The &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Moscow%20%281921%29\"&gt;Treaty of Moscow&lt;/a&gt; and the Treaty of Kars established the Nakhchivan region as an autonomous republic under the protection of the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.\nStamps and postal history.\nBefore 1923, &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Georgia\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; issued each its own &lt;a href=\"postage%20stamp\"&gt;postage stamp&lt;/a&gt;s. The Transcaucasian Federation began issuing its own stamps on September 15, 1923, and superseded the separate republics' issues on October 1.\nThe first issues consisted of some of the stamps of Russia and Armenia &lt;a href=\"overprint\"&gt;overprint&lt;/a&gt;ed with a star containing the five-letter acronym of the Federation inside the points. Massive &lt;a href=\"inflation\"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt; having set in, this was followed by an issue of the Federation's own designs, four values of a view of &lt;a href=\"oil%20field\"&gt;oil field&lt;/a&gt;s, and four with a montage of Soviet symbols over mountains and &lt;a href=\"oil%20derrick\"&gt;oil derrick&lt;/a&gt;s, values ranging from 40,000 to 500,000 &lt;a href=\"Russian%20ruble\"&gt;rubles&lt;/a&gt;. The 40,000 rubles and 75,000 rubles were then surcharged to 700,000 rubles. On October 24, the stamps were re-issued with values from 1 to 18 &lt;a href=\"gold%20kopeck\"&gt;gold kopeck&lt;/a&gt;s. Starting in 1924, the Federation used stamps of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of the stamps of the Federation are not especially rare today, with 1998 prices in the US$1\u20132 range, although the overprints on Armenian stamps range up to US$200. As might be expected from a short period of usage, used stamps are less common than unused and &lt;a href=\"Cover%20%28philately%29\"&gt;cover&lt;/a&gt;s are not often seen."
