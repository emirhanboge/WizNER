He was a fast and tricky player renowned for his accurate &lt;a href=\"Cross%20%28football%29\"&gt;crosses&lt;/a&gt; and described as \"an out and out &lt;a href=\"right%20winger\"&gt;right winger&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe joined Thames Ironworks for &lt;a href=\"1897-98%20Thames%20Ironworks%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;season 1897\u201398&lt;/a&gt;, his high quality crosses contributed towards the Ironworks winning the &lt;a href=\"London%20League%20%28football%29%23Division%20One%201897%E2%80%931898\"&gt;1897\u201398 London League&lt;/a&gt;.

With this game, his career ended abruptly for an unknown reason."
