Located in the south-west of the country near the border with &lt;a href=\"Cameroon\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;, it serves as capital of the &lt;a href=\"Mamb%C3%A9r%C3%A9-Kad%C3%A9%C3%AF\"&gt;Mamb\u00e9r\u00e9-Kad\u00e9\u00ef&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prefectures%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic\"&gt;Prefecture&lt;/a&gt; and gives its name (as capital) to the main &lt;a href=\"Sub-prefectures%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic\"&gt;Sub-prefecture&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded in 1893. In the early 20th century Berb\u00e9rati was part of &lt;a href=\"Oubangui-Chari\"&gt;Oubangui-Chari&lt;/a&gt;, one of the four territories comprising &lt;a href=\"French%20Equatorial%20Africa\"&gt;French Equatorial Africa&lt;/a&gt; which later became Central African Republic. In 1911 it was ceded to the &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt; under the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Morocco%E2%80%93Congo%20Treaty\"&gt;Morocco\u2013Congo Treaty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Fez\"&gt;Treaty of Fez&lt;/a&gt;, becoming part of the German colony of &lt;a href=\"Neukamerun\"&gt;Neukamerun&lt;/a&gt;, until it was reconquered by the French in 1916 following the defeat of German forces in western Africa during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.\nHealth.\nThe state-owned &lt;a href=\"Teaching%20hospital\"&gt;university hospital&lt;/a&gt; of Berb\u00e9rati is an unfenced complex of several bungalows near the town center. The hospital was constructed in the 1950s and operated by French military doctors until the 1980s. The French hospital administrators were succeeded by an expatriate Italian Catholic nun, although the hospital also receives Protestant support.\nTransports.\nBerb\u00e9rati is served by the &lt;a href=\"Berb%C3%A9rati%20Airport\"&gt;Berb\u00e9rati Airport&lt;/a&gt;. \nClimate.\n&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen-Geiger%20climate%20classification%20system\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system&lt;/a&gt; classifies Berb\u00e9rati\u2019s climate as &lt;a href=\"tropical%20wet%20and%20dry%20climate\"&gt;tropical wet and dry&lt;/a&gt; (\"Aw\").\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the &lt;a href=\"places%20of%20worship\"&gt;places of worship&lt;/a&gt;, they are predominantly &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; \nchurches and temples : &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic\"&gt;Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Lutheran%20World%20Federation\"&gt;Lutheran World Federation&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Baptist%20Church%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic\"&gt;Evangelical Baptist Church of the Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Baptist%20World%20Alliance\"&gt;Baptist World Alliance&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Berb%C3%A9rati\"&gt;Roman Catholic Diocese of Berb\u00e9rati&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;).
