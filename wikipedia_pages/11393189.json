    "text": "Adansonia suarezensis, the Suarez baobab, is an &lt;a href=\"Endangered%20species\"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt; species of \"&lt;a href=\"Adansonia\"&gt;Adansonia&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Madagascar\"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;. It is locally called \"bozy\" (pronounced \"boojy\"), the common name used for all baobabs in northern Madagascar. \nDescription.\n\"Adansonia suarezensis\" is a large tree up to tall, with a cylindrical trunk to in diameter. The bark is smooth and greyish-brown and a photosynthetic greenish layer can be seen underneath. The short, thick branches project horizontally from high on the trunk forming a horizontal crown. The &lt;a href=\"Leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are palmate with 6 to 9 leaflets, yellowish-green, untoothed and deciduous. Large white &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, drying to reddish brown, are produced after the leaves have fallen. They open at dusk and the reproductive phase is over by dawn. Flowers are pollinated by &lt;a href=\"fruit%20bats\"&gt;fruit bats&lt;/a&gt;. Flowering occurs in late May to early July. Dangling, elongated &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; that can weigh as much as . are ripe by November.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Adansonia suarezensis\" grows in the northern tip of the island of Madagascar near &lt;a href=\"Antsiranana%20Bay\"&gt;Antsiranana Bay&lt;/a&gt;. A further population has been found growing between the &lt;a href=\"Ankarana%20Reserve\"&gt;Ankarana Reserve&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Analamerana%20Reserve\"&gt;Analamerana Reserve&lt;/a&gt; in the Forest of Mahory. Its typical habitat is deciduous woodland in limestone areas but it also grows in disturbed scrub.\nEcology.\nThe flowers are strong smelling and produce copious nectar and are visited by bees, moths and sunbirds but none of these are big enough to pollinate it. At times of year when fruit is not available, the &lt;a href=\"Madagascan%20fruit%20bat\"&gt;Madagascan fruit bat&lt;/a&gt; feeds on nectar and has been observed to visit the flowers of \"A. suarezensis\" and the kapok tree \"&lt;a href=\"Ceiba%20pentandra\"&gt;Ceiba pentandra&lt;/a&gt;\". This bat is believed to be a significant &lt;a href=\"Pollination\"&gt;pollinator&lt;/a&gt; of the flowers of these trees.\nStatus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"IUCN\"&gt;IUCN&lt;/a&gt; lists \"A. suarezensis\" as \"&lt;a href=\"Endangered\"&gt;Endangered&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20List%20of%20Threatened%20Species\"&gt;Red List of Threatened Species&lt;/a&gt;. This is because little natural regeneration has been observed except in the Mahory Forest, and populations are small and fragmented. Numbers are declining, as trees are cleared for urban development, agriculture and grazing or cut for timber and charcoal. No Madagascan animals have been identified as dispersing the seed of this tree."
