    "text": "SC Tiligul-Tiras Tiraspol was a &lt;a href=\"Moldova\"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Tiraspol\"&gt;Tiraspol&lt;/a&gt;. They played in the &lt;a href=\"Moldovan%20National%20Division\"&gt;Divizia Na\u0163ional\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, the top division in Moldovan football. Their home stadium was &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Municipal%20%28Tiraspol%29\"&gt;Stadionul Municipal&lt;/a&gt;. Currently the club's football academy is associated with another Moldovan club &lt;a href=\"FC%20Zaria%20B%C4%83l%C8%9Bi\"&gt;FC Zaria B\u0103l\u021bi&lt;/a&gt; and competes in football competitions as its reserve team in lower Moldovan leagues.\nHistory.\nHistorical outlook.\nTiligul Tiraspol was the original and oldest football team in &lt;a href=\"Tiraspol\"&gt;Tiraspol&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href=\"Transnistria\"&gt;Transnistria&lt;/a&gt;. It was traditionally the city's only team, but in 2002 the team formerly known as \"Constructorul Chi\u015fin\u0103u\" moved to Tiraspol and changed its name to &lt;a href=\"FC%20Tiraspol\"&gt;FC Tiraspol&lt;/a&gt;, and the same year &lt;a href=\"FC%20Sheriff\"&gt;FC Sheriff&lt;/a&gt; was founded as well, thus bringing the number of home teams to three. If the &lt;a href=\"USSR\"&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt; had not dissolved, they would have played in the &lt;a href=\"USSR%20Top%20League\"&gt;USSR Top League&lt;/a&gt; in 1992, because they were runners-up of the &lt;a href=\"USSR%20First%20League\"&gt;USSR First League&lt;/a&gt; in 1991. Since the establishment of the National championship, the club along with &lt;a href=\"Zimbru%20Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u\"&gt;Zimbru Chi\u015fin\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; were main contenders for the top titles. With establishing of Sheriff Tiraspol, Tiligul has faded away and eventually creased its operations. Sheriff became the best club not only in the city but across the whole &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Moldova\"&gt;Republic of Moldova&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong its most famous former players is &lt;a href=\"Serghei%20Covalciuc\"&gt;Serghei Covalciuc&lt;/a&gt;, who was discovered in 1999 and was hired to play for &lt;a href=\"FC%20Spartak%20Moscow\"&gt;Spartak Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.\nTiligul took part in European club competitions five times but never won a match in either Cup Winner's Cup or UEFA Cup qualifying which makes them one of the rare teams to have played at least 10 matches in European club competitions (Intertoto Cup excluded) without scoring any victories (though the record for being the least successful team in European club competitions is believed to be Etzella Ettelbruck (Luxembourg) because Etzella lost all their twelve games in UEFA Cup qualifying rounds between 2001 and 2007).\nTiligul's colors were crimson shirts and shorts at home and either white shirts and shorts or violet shirts and shorts on the road.\nTiligul-Tiras had to cease operations after they were not able to provide the necessary funds to keep the club alive.\nLater the club found agreement with another Moldavian club &lt;a href=\"FC%20Olimpia\"&gt;FC Olimpia&lt;/a&gt;, yielding its club's infrastructure for adaptation of the Olimpia's farm team Olimpia-2 as Olimpia-2 Tiligul.\nEuropean record.\n&lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;"
