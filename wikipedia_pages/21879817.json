    "text": "Sebastian Alexander Jung (born 22 June 1990) is a German professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; who plays as a &lt;a href=\"right%20back\"&gt;right back&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Karlsruher%20SC\"&gt;Karlsruher SC&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2.%20Bundesliga\"&gt;2. Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nJung played his first &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; match for &lt;a href=\"Eintracht%20Frankfurt\"&gt;Eintracht Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, and first fully professional game, on 8 March 2009 in a 0\u20130 draw against &lt;a href=\"Arminia%20Bielefeld\"&gt;Arminia Bielefeld&lt;/a&gt;, as a substitute for &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Ochs\"&gt;Patrick Ochs&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 February 2010, he scored his first Bundesliga goal at &lt;a href=\"Signal%20Iduna%20Park\"&gt;Signal Iduna Park&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20Dortmund\"&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt;. He became a regular in the Frankfurt first team during the 2010\u201311 season, during which they were surprisingly relegated from the Bundesliga, but was almost ever-present the following season as they bounced back at the first attempt. He extended his contract on 4 April 2013 until 30 June 2015.\nHe joined &lt;a href=\"VfL%20Wolfsburg\"&gt;VfL Wolfsburg&lt;/a&gt; on 22 May 2014 and signed a contract until 30 June 2018. Although he was still under contract with Frankfurt, Wolfsburg were able to acquire his services by fulfilling a release clause in the amount of \u20ac2.5 million. His annual salary at Wolfsburg was reported as \u20ac4 million.\nOn 23 June 2019, Jung joined &lt;a href=\"Hannover%2096\"&gt;Hannover 96&lt;/a&gt; on a one-year contract.\nAfter his contract in Hannover had expired, Jung joined &lt;a href=\"Karlsruher%20SC\"&gt;Karlsruher SC&lt;/a&gt; on 22 September 2020 on a one-year contract.\nInternational career.\nJung played for the German &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20youth%20football%20team\"&gt;U18&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20under-21%20football%20team\"&gt;U21&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20under-21%20football%20team\"&gt;U21&lt;/a&gt; national teams.\nOn 11 November 2012, Jung was first called up to the &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;German senior squad&lt;/a&gt;, following injury related withdrawals by several players, including &lt;a href=\"Holger%20Badstuber\"&gt;Holger Badstuber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Boateng\"&gt;J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng&lt;/a&gt;, before a friendly against &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; on 14 November 2012. He is the first &lt;a href=\"Eintracht%20Frankfurt\"&gt;Eintracht Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; player to be called up to the national team since &lt;a href=\"Horst%20Heldt\"&gt;Horst Heldt&lt;/a&gt; in 1999. Nevertheless, he did not play in the match.\nAlmost two years later, in May 2014, he was called up for the second time. In a 0\u20130 draw in a friendly against &lt;a href=\"Poland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; in Hamburg he made his debut by being substituted in the 71st minute for fellow debutant &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Volland\"&gt;Kevin Volland&lt;/a&gt;. Originally this match was scheduled as a test for the &lt;a href=\"2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2014 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. But unfortunately its date collided with the &lt;a href=\"2014%20DFB-Pokal%20Final\"&gt;DFB-Pokal final&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;FC Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20Dortmund\"&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"2014%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2014%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;Champions League final&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20CF\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;. The players of these four teams made up the vast majority of the regular German squad at that time. Consequently, only ten of the 30 nominated players of the preliminary world cup squad were available and in the end twelve players made their debuts in the match.\nHonours.\nEintracht Frankfurt\nVfL Wolfsburg"
