    "title": "Marilyn Miller",
    "text": "Marilyn Miller (born Mary Ellen Reynolds; September 1, 1898 \u2013 April 7, 1936) was one of the most popular Broadway musical stars of the 1920s and early 1930s. She was an accomplished &lt;a href=\"tap%20dance\"&gt;tap dance&lt;/a&gt;r, &lt;a href=\"Singing\"&gt;singer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Actor\"&gt;actress&lt;/a&gt;, and the combination of these talents endeared her to audiences. On stage, she usually played rags-to-riches Cinderella characters who lived happily ever after. Her enormous popularity and famed image were in distinct contrast to her personal life, which was marred by disappointment, tragedy, frequent illness, and ultimately her sudden death due to complications of nasal surgery at age 37.\nEarly life.\nMarilyn Miller was born in 1898 in Evansville, Indiana, the youngest daughter of Edwin D. Reynolds, a telephone lineman, and his first wife, the former Ada Lynn Thompson. The tiny, delicately featured blonde was only four years old when she debuted in the role of Mademoiselle Sugarlump at Lakeside Park in Dayton, Ohio, performing as a member of her family's &lt;a href=\"vaudeville\"&gt;vaudeville&lt;/a&gt; act, named The Columbian Trio. That act, which included her stepfather Oscar Caro Miller and her older sisters Ruth and Claire, was renamed the Five Columbians after she and her mother joined the routine. From their home base in Findlay, Ohio, the five toured the Midwest and Europe for 10 years and managed during that time to skirt the child labor authorities until &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Shubert\"&gt;Lee Shubert&lt;/a&gt; discovered Miller at the Lotus Club in London in 1914.\nCareer.\nMiller appeared in New York City for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Shubert%20Brothers\"&gt;Shuberts&lt;/a&gt; in the 1914 and 1915 editions of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Passing%20Show\"&gt;The Passing Show&lt;/a&gt;\", a Broadway revue at the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Garden%20Theatre\"&gt;Winter Garden Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in \"The Show of Wonders\" (1916) and \"Fancy Free\" (1918). It was, however, &lt;a href=\"Florenz%20Ziegfeld\"&gt;Florenz Ziegfeld&lt;/a&gt; who made her a star after she performed in his &lt;a href=\"Ziegfeld%20Follies\"&gt;Ziegfeld Follies&lt;/a&gt; of 1918 in Manhattan at the &lt;a href=\"New%20Amsterdam%20Theatre\"&gt;New Amsterdam Theatre&lt;/a&gt; on 42nd Street, with music by &lt;a href=\"Irving%20Berlin\"&gt;Irving Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. Sharing billing with &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Cantor\"&gt;Eddie Cantor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Will%20Rogers\"&gt;Will Rogers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"W.%20C.%20Fields\"&gt;W. C. Fields&lt;/a&gt;, she brought the house down with her impersonation of &lt;a href=\"Billie%20Burke\"&gt;Billie Burke&lt;/a&gt;, Ziegfeld's wife, in a number titled \"Mine Was a Marriage of Convenience\".\nMiller followed as a headliner in the \"Follies of 1919\", dancing to Berlin's &lt;a href=\"Mandy%20%281919%20song%29\"&gt;\"Mandy\"&lt;/a&gt; and reputedly became Ziegfeld's mistress, though this was never proven. She attained legendary status in the Ziegfeld production \"&lt;a href=\"Sally%20%28musical%29\"&gt;Sally&lt;/a&gt;\" (1920) with music by &lt;a href=\"Jerome%20Kern\"&gt;Jerome Kern&lt;/a&gt;, especially for her performance of Kern's \"&lt;a href=\"Look%20for%20the%20Silver%20Lining\"&gt;Look for the Silver Lining&lt;/a&gt;\". The musical, about a dishwasher who joins the Follies and marries a millionaire, ran 570 performances at the New Amsterdam. In 1921, the still-obscure &lt;a href=\"Dorothy%20Parker\"&gt;Dorothy Parker&lt;/a&gt; memorialized her performance in verse:\nFrom the alley's gloom and chill / Up to fame danced \"Sally\". / Which was nice for her, but still / Rough upon the alley. / How it must regret her wiles. / All her ways and glances. / Now the theatre owns her smiles, / Sallies, songs, and dances. ...\nAfter a rift with Ziegfeld, Miller signed with rival producer &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Dillingham\"&gt;Charles Dillingham&lt;/a&gt; and starred as \"&lt;a href=\"Peter%20Pan\"&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/a&gt;\" in a 1924 Broadway revival, then as a circus queen in \"&lt;a href=\"Sunny%20%28musical%29\"&gt;Sunny&lt;/a&gt;\" (1925), with music by Kern and lyrics by &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Hammerstein%20II\"&gt;Oscar Hammerstein&lt;/a&gt;. A box-office smash, it featured the classic \"&lt;a href=\"Who%3F%20%28song%29\"&gt;Who?&lt;/a&gt;\", and made her the highest paid star on Broadway. In 1928, after reuniting with Ziegfeld, she starred in his production of the successful &lt;a href=\"George%20Gershwin\"&gt;George Gershwin&lt;/a&gt; musical \"&lt;a href=\"Rosalie%20%28musical%29\"&gt;Rosalie&lt;/a&gt;\", then in \"Smiles\" (1930) with &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Astaire\"&gt;Fred Astaire&lt;/a&gt;, one of Ziegfeld's rare box-office failures.\nMiller's movie career was short-lived and less successful than her stage career. She made only three films: adaptations of \"&lt;a href=\"Sally%20%281929%20film%29\"&gt;Sally&lt;/a&gt;\" (1929), \"&lt;a href=\"Sunny%20%281930%20film%29\"&gt;Sunny&lt;/a&gt;\" (1930), and \"&lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%2C%20Love\"&gt;Her Majesty, Love&lt;/a&gt;\" (1931), with W. C. Fields. Her last Broadway show, marking a major comeback, was the innovative 1933-1934 &lt;a href=\"Irving%20Berlin\"&gt;Irving Berlin&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Moss%20Hart\"&gt;Moss Hart&lt;/a&gt; musical \"&lt;a href=\"As%20Thousands%20Cheer\"&gt;As Thousands Cheer&lt;/a&gt;\", in which she appeared in the production number \"&lt;a href=\"Easter%20Parade%20%28song%29\"&gt;Easter Parade&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMiller's appearance in \"As Thousands Cheer\" was her last professional outing. She quit the show after her boyfriend and future husband Chester O'Brien \u2013 a chorus dancer who served as the production's second assistant stage manager \u2013 was fired for allowing the Woolworth department store heir &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Donahue\"&gt;Jimmy Donahue&lt;/a&gt; to sneak onstage during a scene in which she was impersonating his cousin, the heiress &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Hutton\"&gt;Barbara Hutton&lt;/a&gt;. After her death, this incident gave Irving Berlin the inspiration for a film musical \"&lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Avenue\"&gt;On the Avenue&lt;/a&gt;\", for which he received a script credit in addition to writing the songs.\nAt the time of her death, Miller was described as being in retirement.\nOrigin of stage name.\nMiller's last name was adopted from the surname of her stepfather, Oscar Caro Miller, while her first name was formed by combining her birth name, Mary, with her mother's middle name, Lynn. Initially calling herself Marilynn, she would drop one \"n\" at the urging of Florenz Ziegfeld.\nIn the late 1940s, Norma Jeane Baker (n\u00e9e Mortenson) changed her name to &lt;a href=\"Marilyn%20Monroe\"&gt;Marilyn Monroe&lt;/a&gt; at the urging of &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Lyon\"&gt;Ben Lyon&lt;/a&gt;, a one-time actor turned casting director at &lt;a href=\"20th%20Century%20Fox\"&gt;20th Century Fox&lt;/a&gt;, who said she reminded him of Miller \u2013 he had played Miller's love interest in \"&lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%2C%20Love\"&gt;Her Majesty, Love&lt;/a&gt;\". Monroe had the name Marilyn Miller when she married the playwright &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Miller\"&gt;Arthur Miller&lt;/a&gt; in 1956.\nPersonal life.\nEngagements and marriages.\nMiller was married to:\nIn 1930, Miller briefly was engaged to Michael Farmer, who later became a husband of &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Swanson\"&gt;Gloria Swanson&lt;/a&gt;. In 1932, she announced her intention to marry &lt;a href=\"Don%20Alvarado\"&gt;Don Alvarado&lt;/a&gt;, but the wedding did not take place.\nIllnesses, alcoholism, and death.\nMiller had a long history of &lt;a href=\"sinus%20infection\"&gt;sinus infection&lt;/a&gt;s, and her health was compromised by an increasing dependence on alcohol. According to reports shortly before her death, she entered a New York hospital in early March 1936 to recover from a nervous breakdown. Three weeks later, however, she developed a toxic condition and died from complications following surgery on her &lt;a href=\"Nasal%20cavity\"&gt;nasal passages&lt;/a&gt; at age 37 in New York City on the morning of April 7, 1936.\nMiller's funeral was held at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Bartholomew%27s%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Manhattan%29\"&gt;Saint Bartholomew Church&lt;/a&gt; on Park Avenue which drew 2,500\u00a0people, including former mayor &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Walker\"&gt;Jimmy Walker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beatrice%20Lillie\"&gt;Beatrice Lillie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Billie%20Burke\"&gt;Billie Burke&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe procession led to &lt;a href=\"Woodlawn%20Cemetery%20%28Bronx%29\"&gt;Woodlawn Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in the Bronx, where Miller was buried alongside her first husband, Frank Carter, in a mausoleum she had constructed to house his remains.\nMemorials.\nA statue of Miller, in the title role of \"Sunny,\" can still be seen atop the former I. Miller (no relation) Shoe Company Building at &lt;a href=\"1552%20Broadway\"&gt;1552 Broadway&lt;/a&gt;, in Times Square, Manhattan. It is one of four sculpted by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Stirling%20Calder%23Architectural%20sculpture\"&gt;Alexander Stirling Calder&lt;/a&gt; between 1927 and 1929 for the building's facade, representing famous theatrical professionals of the time. In 2013, after years of neglect, the building and statues were restored.\nOne of the poems in &lt;a href=\"Patti%20Smith\"&gt;Patti Smith&lt;/a&gt;'s 1972 book \"&lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Heaven%20%28book%29\"&gt;Seventh Heaven&lt;/a&gt;\" is titled \"Marilyn Miller\".\nBiographies (film and print).\nIn 1949, a sanitized biopic, appropriately titled \"&lt;a href=\"Look%20for%20the%20Silver%20Lining%20%28film%29\"&gt;Look for the Silver Lining&lt;/a&gt;\", starred &lt;a href=\"June%20Haver\"&gt;June Haver&lt;/a&gt; as Miller. She was portrayed by &lt;a href=\"Judy%20Garland\"&gt;Judy Garland&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Till%20the%20Clouds%20Roll%20By\"&gt;Till the Clouds Roll By&lt;/a&gt;,\" MGM's biopic of &lt;a href=\"Jerome%20Kern\"&gt;Jerome Kern&lt;/a&gt;. In 1978, the story of her tempestuous relationship with Ziegfeld was portrayed in the &lt;a href=\"Emmy%20Award\"&gt;Emmy&lt;/a&gt;-winning made-for-TV biopic \"Ziegfeld: The Man and His Women\", starring Pamela Peadin as Miller, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Shenar\"&gt;Paul Shenar&lt;/a&gt; as Ziegfeld, and &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Willison\"&gt;Walter Willison&lt;/a&gt; as Frank Carter. Rare film footage of Miller in the 1929 film version of \"&lt;a href=\"Sally%20%281929%20film%29\"&gt;Sally&lt;/a&gt;\" can also be seen in the 2004 PBS documentary series \"Broadway, the American Musical\".\nIn the only published biography of Miller, \"The Other Marilyn\" (1985), author Warren G. Harris describes her as \"Ziegfeld's most dazzling star\" and the premier musical comedy star of the &lt;a href=\"Jazz%20Age\"&gt;Jazz Age&lt;/a&gt;. He adds, \"She had rivals who may have been better dancers, singers, actresses, or mimics, but no one individual could equal her when it came to combining all those talents.\"\nFilmography.\nAll three films survive in some form, but \"Sally\", filmed entirely in two-color Technicolor, now exists only in black-and-white, except for one fragment \u2013 most of the \"Wild Rose\" musical number \u2013 that has survived from an original Technicolor print."
