    "text": "Hugh Hewitt (born February 22, 1956) is an American radio talk show host with the &lt;a href=\"Salem%20Radio%20Network\"&gt;Salem Radio Network&lt;/a&gt; and an attorney, &lt;a href=\"academic\"&gt;academic&lt;/a&gt;, and author. A &lt;a href=\"Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;, he writes about law, society, politics, and &lt;a href=\"media%20bias%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;media bias in the United States&lt;/a&gt;. Hewitt is president and CEO of the &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon%20Foundation\"&gt;Richard Nixon Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a law professor at &lt;a href=\"Chapman%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Chapman University School of Law&lt;/a&gt;, a columnist for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\", and a regular political commentator on &lt;a href=\"NBC%20News\"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"MSNBC\"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nHewitt is the son of Marguerite (n\u00e9e Rohl) and William Robert Hewitt. He describes himself as \"a descendant of both &lt;a href=\"Ulster\"&gt;Ulster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;the Republic&lt;/a&gt; through a green-orange marriage of immigrants from &lt;a href=\"County%20Down\"&gt;County Down&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"County%20Clare\"&gt;County Clare&lt;/a&gt;\". He attended &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy%20High%20School%20%28Warren%2C%20Ohio%29\"&gt;John F. Kennedy Catholic High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Warren%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Warren, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. He then graduated \"&lt;a href=\"cum%20laude\"&gt;cum laude&lt;/a&gt;\" from &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20College\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Bachelors%20of%20Arts\"&gt;B.A.&lt;/a&gt; in government in 1978. After leaving Harvard, he worked as a ghostwriter for &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, before studying at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Michigan%20Law%20School\"&gt;University of Michigan Law School&lt;/a&gt;, where he was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Coif\"&gt;Order of the Coif&lt;/a&gt;. Hewitt received his &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Doctor\"&gt;J.D.&lt;/a&gt; degree in 1983, then moved to &lt;a href=\"Washington%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; to clerk for Judges &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Robb\"&gt;Roger Robb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20MacKinnon\"&gt;George MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit\"&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit&lt;/a&gt; in 1983\u201384.\nCareer.\nHewitt worked in many posts in the &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Reagan\"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; administration, including deputy director and General Counsel of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Office%20of%20Personnel%20Management\"&gt;Office of Personnel Management&lt;/a&gt;, General Counsel for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Humanities\"&gt;National Endowment for the Humanities&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant &lt;a href=\"White%20House%20Counsel\"&gt;White House Counsel&lt;/a&gt;, and Special Assistant to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Attorney%20General\"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1989, Hewitt became the executive director of the &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon%20Presidential%20Library%20and%20Museum\"&gt;Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum&lt;/a&gt;. In 1990, he sparked controversy by proposing screening of researchers wishing to use the library resources. Hewitt suggested refusing admission to researchers deemed \"unfriendly\" \u2013 specifically &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Woodward\"&gt;Bob Woodward&lt;/a&gt;, whom he characterized as \"not a responsible journalist.\" John Taylor, a spokesman for Nixon, overturned Hewitt's decision after two days. It became the subject of editorial rebuke in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHewitt left the Nixon Library in 1990. He hosted a weekend radio talk show for the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; radio station &lt;a href=\"KFI\"&gt;KFI&lt;/a&gt;, where he broadcast until 1995. In the spring of 1992, he began co-hosting L.A. &lt;a href=\"PBS\"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt; member station &lt;a href=\"KCET\"&gt;KCET&lt;/a&gt;'s program \"&lt;a href=\"Life%20%26amp%3B%20Times%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Life &amp; Times&lt;/a&gt;\", and remained with the program until the fall of 2001, when he began broadcasting his own radio show. Hewitt received three &lt;a href=\"Emmy%20Awards\"&gt;Emmys&lt;/a&gt; for his work on \"Life &amp; Times\" on KCET, and also conceived and hosted the 1996 PBS series \"Searching for God in America.\"\nHe has worked as a weekly columnist for the \"Daily Standard\" (the online edition of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Weekly%20Standard\"&gt;The Weekly Standard&lt;/a&gt;\") and \"&lt;a href=\"World%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;World&lt;/a&gt;\". He has appeared on programs such as \"The &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Miller\"&gt;Dennis Miller&lt;/a&gt; Show\", \"&lt;a href=\"Hardball%20with%20Chris%20Matthews\"&gt;Hardball with Chris Matthews&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Larry%20King%20Live\"&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20O%27Reilly%20Factor\"&gt;The O'Reilly Factor&lt;/a&gt;,\" \"&lt;a href=\"Today%20%28NBC%20program%29\"&gt;The Today Show&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Colbert%20Report\"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHewitt also became a Professor of Law at Chapman University School of Law. Hewitt founded the journal \"Nexus Journal of Law and Policy\".\nIn 2019, Hewitt returned to the Nixon Library as president and CEO of the &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon%20Foundation\"&gt;Richard Nixon Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the nonprofit that co-operates the Nixon Library with the &lt;a href=\"National%20Archives%20and%20Records%20Administration\"&gt;National Archives and Records Administration&lt;/a&gt;. On his first day in the job, Hewitt announced that he would split his time between Orange County and Washington, D.C. and open a Nixon Foundation office in Washington.\nIn March 2020, after &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Biden\"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"2020%20South%20Carolina%20Democratic%20presidential%20primary\"&gt;South Carolina presidential primary&lt;/a&gt;, Hewitt predicted that Biden's victory would be of little benefit to &lt;a href=\"2020%20Joe%20Biden%20presidential%20campaign\"&gt;his campaign&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Sanders\"&gt;Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt; would perform strongly on &lt;a href=\"Super%20Tuesday%202020\"&gt;Super Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;; after Biden took the lead on Super Tuesday and eventually won the Democratic nomination, \"&lt;a href=\"Politico\"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;\" named Hewitt's predictions among \"the most audacious, confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications about the year\".\n\"The Hugh Hewitt Show\" (radio).\nHewitt's nationally syndicated radio show, \"The Hugh Hewitt Show\", is broadcast from California from 6 to 9 am ET on weekdays. The show appears on more than 75 stations and is syndicated by the &lt;a href=\"Salem%20Radio%20Network\"&gt;Salem Radio Network&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning April 4, 2016, the show moved to a morning &lt;a href=\"drive%20time\"&gt;drive time&lt;/a&gt; slot. Although Hewitt's background is in law, government, and politics, he also covers American cultural trends and the entertainment industry. He frequently critiques the mainstream media on air, often inviting journalists to defend their work on the show. His regular contributors include law professors &lt;a href=\"John%20C.%20Eastman\"&gt;John C. Eastman&lt;/a&gt;, former Dean of &lt;a href=\"Chapman%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Chapman University School of Law&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Erwin%20Chemerinsky\"&gt;Erwin Chemerinsky&lt;/a&gt;, erstwhile Dean of &lt;a href=\"UC%20Irvine%20Law%20School\"&gt;UC Irvine Law School&lt;/a&gt; and current Dean of &lt;a href=\"UC%20Berkeley%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;UC Berkeley School of Law&lt;/a&gt; (whom Hewitt calls \"The Smart Guys\"), &lt;a href=\"James%20Lileks\"&gt;James Lileks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Steyn\"&gt;Mark Steyn&lt;/a&gt;, United States Naval Academy English professor David Allen White (who does a monthly Shakespeare showcase), and Congressman &lt;a href=\"David%20Dreier\"&gt;David Dreier&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-CA), as well as frequent callers from around the country. He used to spend the 15th hour of the week discussing movies with \"Emmett of the Unblinking Eye\".\n\"Hugh Hewitt\" (television).\nOn June 24, 2017, \"Hugh Hewitt\" debuted, a half-hour television show which ran on MSNBC in the Saturdays 8 a.m. EST timeslot. On the show, he conducted interviews and provided commentary on current events. On Saturday, June 30, 2018, Hewitt announced that the show had been cancelled, but that he would continue his commentary on the NBC family of networks.\nPolitical views.\nHewitt has described &lt;a href=\"George%20Will\"&gt;George Will&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Krauthammer\"&gt;Charles Krauthammer&lt;/a&gt; as models for his style of punditry. \"&lt;a href=\"Politico\"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;\" described Hewitt as an \"ardent Reaganite\".\nForeign policy.\nIn a 2006 interview on &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; with Anderson Cooper, Hewitt said that in regards to &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s decisions while President, the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Iraq\"&gt;War in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; would go down as \"one of the wisest he has made.\" In regard to the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Syrian Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, Hewitt stated that President Donald Trump was making a \"major error\" in deciding to draw down the number of U.S. troops in the country, over seven years after the beginning of the conflict. Hewitt has advocated for increasing the defense budget in the United States, stating that \"any Republicans who vote against higher defense spending should be fired.\"\nDonald Trump.\nHewitt moderated several of the 2016 Republican primary debates, where he clashed with &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. Hewitt said that Trump did not possess \"the temperament to be president\". In February 2016, Hewitt wrote that, despite being repeatedly publicly insulted by Trump, he would support him should he become the Republican nominee for president. In June 2016, after Trump's controversial remarks concerning Judge &lt;a href=\"Gonzalo%20Curiel\"&gt;Gonzalo Curiel&lt;/a&gt;, Hewitt publicly called on the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20National%20Committee\"&gt;RNC&lt;/a&gt; to disendorse Trump as nominee. A week later, Hewitt reversed his position in a \"Washington Post\" op-ed. Internal emails showed that a Salem Media executive pressured Hewitt to support Trump, and that the Salem Media executive attributed Hewitt's support for Trump in the aforementioned \"Washington Post\" op-ed shortly after to the pressure. Hewitt denied being pressured to change his position on Trump.\nOn August 3, he publicly floated the idea of replacing Donald with &lt;a href=\"Ivanka%20Trump\"&gt;Ivanka Trump&lt;/a&gt; on the ticket. On October 8, he called on Trump to drop out of the race after the &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump%20and%20Billy%20Bush%20recording\"&gt;\"Access Hollywood\" tape&lt;/a&gt; emerged. Hewitt has said he ultimately voted for Trump.\nHewitt supported Trump's decision to re-shuffle his foreign policy staff in March\u2013April 2018, and place &lt;a href=\"John%20Bolton\"&gt;John Bolton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Pompeo\"&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/a&gt; in key national security positions. He described John Bolton, a zionist hawk, as \"peace-through-strength, 600-ship [navy], Reagan conservative\" (as compared to Trump's approach which Hewitt likened to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20White%20Fleet\"&gt;Great White Fleet&lt;/a&gt;). According to \"Politico\", Hewitt emerged \"perhaps the most public advocate for Trump\u2019s hawkish new national security team at a time when others, even inside his own party, have voiced increasing fears that Trump is surrounding himself with war-minded hawks who may play to the president\u2019s worst instincts.\"\nAmid the Trump-Ukraine scandal, which led to the impeachment of President Trump, Hewitt floated a conspiracy theory that the whistleblower complaint that set off the scandal was by a whistleblower who was trying to divert attention from his own involvement in a \"Clintons-Obama-Biden collusion debacle\". He penned an op-ed about the impeachment inquiry titled, \"Impeachment-minded Democrats, welcome to Al Capone\u2019s vault. Look familiar?\" He said that the FBI had tried a \"coup\" against Trump and that Democrats were trying \"another coup\". He described the phone call where Trump requests that the Ukrainian President investigate Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, as a \"nothingburger.\"\nIn October 2019, Hewitt defended Trump's decision to remove a small contingent of US military forces from Northern Syria where they served as a buffer between Turkey and Syrian Kurds, leaving Kurds vulnerable to attack by Turkish forces.\nImmigration.\nIn a June 2018 interview with then &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Attorney%20General\"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Sessions\"&gt;Jeff Sessions&lt;/a&gt;, Hewitt repeatedly pressed Sessions about the morality of the Trump administration's decision to separate undocumented immigrant children from their parents. Hewitt said, \"I don\u2019t think children should be separated from biological parents at any age, but especially if they\u2019re infants and toddlers. I think it\u2019s traumatic and terribly difficult on the child.\"\nControversy and potential lawsuit.\nScott Pruitt.\nIn April 2018, Hewitt defended EPA Administrator &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Pruitt\"&gt;Scott Pruitt&lt;/a&gt; amid controversy over his expenditures as Administrator and a conflict of interest over renting a condo at discounted prices from a lobbyist representing clients regulated by the EPA. \"Politico\" described Hewitt as \"one of Pruitt's staunchest defenders\". Hewitt described the numerous ethics scandals facing Pruitt as \"nonsense scandals\" and argued that Pruitt's critics were \"just trying to stop the deregulation effort\". Hewitt argued that the top EPA ethics official had approved Pruitt's rental arrangement and that it therefore did not constitute a gift. &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Painter\"&gt;Richard Painter&lt;/a&gt;, ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, argued against Hewitt, saying it was a \"violation of the gift rules, and no ethics lawyer could cover that up\".\nHewitt has argued that media coverage of Pruitt has been \"hyperpartisan\". In an interview with Pruitt, Hewitt said \"I know you are not a climate denier\"; Pruitt rejects the &lt;a href=\"Scientific%20opinion%20on%20climate%20change\"&gt;scientific consensus on climate change&lt;/a&gt;. After Pruitt resigned amid a dozen separate ethics investigations, Hewitt defended Pruitt, saying he \"is a good friend and a very good man, caricatured by left and MSM. I hope he sets to work on a memoir ASAP and deals out a tenth of what he took.\"\nThe conflict of interest is that Hugh Hewitt's son, James, is a political appointee working under Pruitt. In May 2018, it was reported that Pruitt had personally prioritized a polluted &lt;a href=\"Orange%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt; site for immediate and intense clean-up via long-term federal clean-up funding after Hewitt had brokered a December 2017 meeting between Pruitt and a legal firm representing the polluted district. The EPA did not disclose the meeting; it was revealed after a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. Hewitt lived in Orange County for over two decades before relocating to Virginia in 2015; he is employed by the law firm. After the meeting, Hewitt would frequently defend Pruitt amid a number of ethics scandals. &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Hiatt\"&gt;Fred Hiatt&lt;/a&gt;, the editorial page editor at \"The Washington Post\", where Hewitt is a contributing columnist, said that he was \"disturbed\" by the reports of Hewitt's undisclosed ties, and that Hewitt would not write on issues related to the EPA again. MSNBC gave Hewitt a verbal warning after he failed to disclose the EPA meeting to viewers of his MSNBC show.\nCNN Debate.\nHewitt was booed during a &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; debate in 2015 for his controversial questioning of presidential candidate &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Carson\"&gt;Ben Carson&lt;/a&gt;. He asked whether Carson was capable of ordering \"ruthless\" military strikes that could kill thousands of innocent children. Following Carson's initial answer to the question, Hewitt asked Carson to confirm whether he was, in fact, \"OK with the death of thousands of innocent children and civilians.\" The audience subsequently booed Hewitt."
