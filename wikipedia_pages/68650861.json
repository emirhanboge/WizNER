    "text": "The 2021 &lt;a href=\"Khabarovsk%20Krai\"&gt;Khabarovsk Krai&lt;/a&gt; gubernatorial election will take place on 17\u201319 September 2021, on &lt;a href=\"2021%20Russian%20regional%20elections\"&gt;common election day&lt;/a&gt;, coinciding with &lt;a href=\"2021%20Russian%20legislative%20election\"&gt;election to the State Duma&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 9 July 2020 Governor &lt;a href=\"Sergei%20Furgal\"&gt;Sergei Furgal&lt;/a&gt; was arrested on charges of involvement in multiple murders. Furgal was removed from office by President &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; on 20 July, and fellow &lt;a href=\"LDPR\"&gt;LDPR&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Degtyarev\"&gt;Mikhail Degtyarev&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as acting Governor.\nMikhail Degtyarev won the election becoming the second consecutive member of &lt;a href=\"LDPR\"&gt;LDPR&lt;/a&gt; elected as Governor of Khabarovsk Krai.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Sergei%20Furgal\"&gt;Sergei Furgal&lt;/a&gt; was unexpectedly elected &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Khabarovsk%20Krai\"&gt;Governor of Khabarovsk Krai&lt;/a&gt; in September 2018, defeating sitting Governor &lt;a href=\"Vyacheslav%20Shport\"&gt;Vyacheslav Shport&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of 41 percentage points. Furgal quickly became a popular figure in regional politics earning an informal title of \"People's Governor\". At some point Sergei Furgal's popularity rate was higher than that of President Putin in &lt;a href=\"Khabarovsk%20Krai\"&gt;Khabarovsk Krai&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019 Khabarovsk regional and local elections &lt;a href=\"LDPR\"&gt;LDPR&lt;/a&gt; cruised to several landslide victories: the party simultaneously won 30 of 36 seats in &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Duma%20of%20Khabarovsk%20Krai\"&gt;Khabarovsk Krai Legislative Duma&lt;/a&gt;, 34 of 35 seats in &lt;a href=\"Khabarovsk\"&gt;Khabarovsk&lt;/a&gt; City Duma, 24 of 25 seats in &lt;a href=\"Komsomolsk-on-Amur\"&gt;Komsomolsk-on-Amur&lt;/a&gt; City Duma and mayorship in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. LDPR candidate &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Pilyaev\"&gt;Ivan Pilyaev&lt;/a&gt; even captured Furgal's former &lt;a href=\"Komsomolsk-na-Amure%20Constituency\"&gt;seat&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"State%20Duma\"&gt;State Duma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Russia\"&gt;United Russia&lt;/a&gt; candidate singer &lt;a href=\"Vika%20Tsiganova\"&gt;Vika Tsiganova&lt;/a&gt; only placed third. Presidential Envoy to the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Eastern%20Federal%20District\"&gt;Far Eastern Federal District&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yury%20Trutnev\"&gt;Yury Trutnev&lt;/a&gt; also, allegedly, had poor relations with Governor Furgal for his lack of cooperation and support of United Russia.\nIn March 2019 former Governor of Khabarovsk Krai (1991-2009) &lt;a href=\"Viktor%20Ishayev\"&gt;Viktor Ishayev&lt;/a&gt; was arrested in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, he was later charged with fraud during his tenure as vice president of &lt;a href=\"Rosneft\"&gt;Rosneft&lt;/a&gt;. Viktor Ishayev was considered as Sergei Furgal's ally and several affiliated with Ishayev politicians worked in Furgal Administration (namely, First Deputy Chairman of the Khabarovsk Krai Government Igor Averin, Deputy Chairman of the Government for Security and Cooperation with Federal Authorities Vladimir Khlapov, and Minister of Finance Aleksandr Katsuba). In April 2019 Deputy Chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Investigative%20Committee%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Investigative Committee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Igor%20Krasnov\"&gt;Igor Krasnov&lt;/a&gt; reopened cases regarding killings of several businessmen in &lt;a href=\"Khabarovsk%20Krai\"&gt;Khabarovsk Krai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amur%20Oblast\"&gt;Amur Oblast&lt;/a&gt; committed during 2004 and 2005. First arrests concerning reopened cases occurred in November 2019 when &lt;a href=\"MVD\"&gt;MVD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Security%20Service\"&gt;FSB&lt;/a&gt; agents arrested former &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Duma%20of%20Khabarovsk%20Krai\"&gt;Khabarovsk Krai Legislative Duma&lt;/a&gt; member Nikolay Mistryukov and three other individuals, they were charged with the murders of businessmen Yevgeny Zorya in 2004 and Oleg Bulatov in 2005, they were also accused of attempting to kill Aleksandr Smolsky in 2004. Law enforcement officials also carried out searches and seized documents in the offices of \"Torex\" group (owned by Nikolay Mistryukov and Furgal's wife Larisa Starodubova), Deputy Chairman of the Government Yury Zolochevsky and Minister of Industry Sergey Denisenko. Nikolay Mistrykov testified against Sergei Furgal while he was being detained in &lt;a href=\"Lefortovo%20Prison\"&gt;Lefortovo Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 9 July 2020 Sergei Furgal was arrested and escorted to Moscow by &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Security%20Service\"&gt;FSB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Investigative%20Committee%20of%20Russia\"&gt;SK&lt;/a&gt; agents. He was accused of 2 assassinations and 1 assassination attempt. Alongside Governor Furgal, four of his associates were detained: &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Duma%20of%20Khabarovsk%20Krai\"&gt;Khabarovsk Krai Legislative Duma&lt;/a&gt; members Dmitry Kozlov and Sergey Kuznetsov, entrepreneurs Nikolay Shukhov and Yevgeny Averyanov.\nSergei Furgal's arrest sparked &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%932021%20Khabarovsk%20Krai%20protests\"&gt;mass protests&lt;/a&gt;. On 11 July 2020 11,000-12,000 people took part in a rally in &lt;a href=\"Khabarovsk\"&gt;Khabarovsk&lt;/a&gt; to support arrested Governor. The protesters believed Furgal's arrest was politically motivated and was an act of revenge from federal authorities for Furgal's independent style of governance. On 18 July an even larger crowd of 50,000 to 80,000 people took the streets of Khabarovsk. Protests also were held in multiple cities all across Russia: from &lt;a href=\"Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk\"&gt;Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;. In Khabarovsk itself continuous pickets were held throughout summer, autumn and even winter 2020-2021.\nWhile Sergei Furgal was detained, a search for his successor has started. Among the considered candidates were &lt;a href=\"Khabarovsk%20Novy%20Airport\"&gt;Khabarovsk Airport&lt;/a&gt; Board of Directors chairman Konstantin Basyuk, &lt;a href=\"LDPR\"&gt;LDPR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"State%20Duma\"&gt;State Duma&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Degtyarev\"&gt;Mikhail Degtyarev&lt;/a&gt;, Deputy Presidential Envoy to the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Eastern%20Federal%20District\"&gt;Far Eastern Federal District&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grigory%20Kuranov\"&gt;Grigory Kuranov&lt;/a&gt;, First Deputy Chairman of Krai Government Yury Zolochevsky and former Deputy Chairman of Krai Government (2011-2015) Andrey Bazilevsky. However, due to ongoing unrests in Khabarovsk and increasing unpopularity of &lt;a href=\"United%20Russia\"&gt;United Russia&lt;/a&gt; in the region its was decided to appoint member of &lt;a href=\"LDPR\"&gt;LDPR&lt;/a&gt;, a party Furgal was member of. Party's shortlist included State Duma member from &lt;a href=\"Primorsky%20Krai\"&gt;Primorsky Krai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Andrey%20Andreychenko\"&gt;Andrey Andreychenko&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the Duma Committee on Sport &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Degtyarev\"&gt;Mikhail Degtyarev&lt;/a&gt;, and chairman of the Duma Committee on Economy and Entrepreneurship &lt;a href=\"Sergey%20Zhigarev\"&gt;Sergey Zhigarev&lt;/a&gt;. On 20 July 2020, 11 days after Sergei Furgal's arrest, President &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; fired Furgal for the \"loss of trust\" and appointed &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Degtyarev\"&gt;Mikhail Degtyarev&lt;/a&gt; as acting Governor of Khabarovsk Krai.\nMikhail Degtyarev quickly draw an ire from Furgal's supporters for his denouncement of &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%932021%20Khabarovsk%20Krai%20protests\"&gt;protest movement&lt;/a&gt;, firings of Krai Government officials and appointment of Moscow and Samara natives to his administration. In August 2020 Degtyarev became acting coordinator of &lt;a href=\"LDPR\"&gt;LDPR&lt;/a&gt; regional office in &lt;a href=\"Khabarovsk%20Krai\"&gt;Khabarovsk Krai&lt;/a&gt;, he was elected to full capacity in February 2021. Mikhail Degtyarev clashed with local LDPR leaders, as the result several prominent politicians left the party, including both &lt;a href=\"Federation%20Council%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Federation Council&lt;/a&gt; senators &lt;a href=\"Yelena%20Greshnyakova\"&gt;Yelena Greshnyakova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sergey%20Bezdenezhnykh\"&gt;Sergey Bezdenezhnykh&lt;/a&gt;, Sergei Furgal's eldest son Anton, &lt;a href=\"Khabarovsk\"&gt;Khabarovsk&lt;/a&gt; City Duma Speaker Mikhail Sidorov and 7 other City Duma members. Greshnyakova, Bezndenezhnykh and Sidorov were favourites to mount a \"pro-Furgal\" challenge to Degtyarev in upcoming gubernatorial election, but all of them ultimately declined with Greshnyakova and Sidorov opting to run for &lt;a href=\"2021%20Russian%20legislative%20election\"&gt;State Duma&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nCandidates.\nOnly political parties can nominate candidates for gubernatorial election in Khabarovsk Krai, self-nomination is not possible.
