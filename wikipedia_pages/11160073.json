    "text": "During the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Kingdom\"&gt;Roman Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Roman Republic&lt;/a&gt; and later, adlecti, or allecti were those who were chosen to fill up a vacancy in any office or &lt;a href=\"collegium%20%28ancient%20Rome%29\"&gt;collegium&lt;/a&gt;, and especially those who were chosen to fill up the proper number of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Senate\"&gt;senate&lt;/a&gt;. As these would be generally &lt;a href=\"Equestrian%20%28Roman%29\"&gt;equites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sextus%20Pompeius%20Festus\"&gt;Festus&lt;/a&gt; defines the \"adlecti\" to be equites added to the senate: and he appears in this passage to make a distinction between the \"adlecti\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"conscripti\"&gt;conscripti&lt;/a&gt;\". This distinction is supported by the summons form used to call the senate which reads \"pares\" and \"conscripti\" beginning in 509 BC. Others argue that they were the same; for in another passage, Festus gives the same definition of the conscripti as he had done of the adlecti, and &lt;a href=\"Livy\"&gt;Livy&lt;/a&gt; (ii.1) says \"conscriptos in novum senatum appellabant lectos\".\nThe adelecti were also those persons under the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; who were admitted to the privileges and honours of the &lt;a href=\"praetor\"&gt;praetor&lt;/a&gt;ship, &lt;a href=\"quaestor\"&gt;quaestor&lt;/a&gt;ship, &lt;a href=\"aedile\"&gt;aedile&lt;/a&gt;ship, and other public offices, without having any duties to perform (\"Historia Augusta\", \"Helvius Pertinax\", 6). In inscriptions we constantly find, \"adlectus inter tribunos\", \"inter quaestores\", \"inter praetores\", etc."
