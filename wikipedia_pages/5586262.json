    "text": "The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra (BBC SSO) is a Scottish broadcasting &lt;a href=\"symphony%20orchestra\"&gt;symphony orchestra&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;. One of five full-time orchestras maintained by the British Broadcasting Corporation (&lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;), it is the oldest full-time professional &lt;a href=\"radio%20orchestra\"&gt;radio orchestra&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland. The orchestra is based at City Halls in Glasgow.\nHistory.\nThe BBC opened its Edinburgh studio in 1930, and decided to form its own full-time Scottish orchestra to complement BBC orchestras already established in London, Manchester and Wales. The BBC Scottish Orchestra was established as Scotland's first full-time orchestra on 1 December 1935 by the BBC's first head of music in Scotland, composer and conductor &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Whyte%20%28conductor%29\"&gt;Ian Whyte&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1938, the orchestra moved into its purpose built home at Studio One, in the newly opened Glasgow Studios, at Broadcasting House in Queen Margaret Drive. The newly formed Scottish Variety Orchestra (which became the &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Scottish%20Radio%20Orchestra\"&gt;BBC Scottish Radio Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; in 1967) occupied Studio Two.\nAs one of the BBC's many ensembles, the orchestra led a busy though sheltered life, broadcasting live at least five times a week from its studio and only occasionally allowed out. Throughout the war, the orchestra fulfilled 30 hours of broadcasts per week on the BBC Home and World Services. This meant live performances at any time of day or night, often broadcasting live to Latin America at half past one in the morning.\nBy the end of the war, during which the orchestra had been expanded in numbers, Whyte had brought it to a standard considered good enough for the newly established &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20Festival\"&gt;Edinburgh Festival&lt;/a&gt;, at which the orchestra has appeared regularly since 1948.\nThrough the 1950s and 1960s, live studio broadcasting still dominated the orchestra's schedule, and there was little time in its schedule for public performances. This situation changed after &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Del%20Mar\"&gt;Norman Del Mar&lt;/a&gt;'s advent as Principal Conductor in 1960. He led the BBC Scottish Orchestra's first visit to The Proms in 1962, and through his efforts the orchestra was further expanded, which led to a change of its title to the \"BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra\" the following year. Del Mar's earliest projects included the UK premiere of &lt;a href=\"Stockhausen\"&gt;Stockhausen&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Gruppen\"&gt;Gruppen&lt;/a&gt;\", performed jointly in Glasgow with the Scottish National Orchestra, and it was his interest in contemporary music that laid the foundation for the BBC SSO's long-standing commitment to new work. The BBC SSO has continued to perform the work of Scottish composers in Scotland and at The Proms, such as the 1990 Premiere of &lt;a href=\"James%20MacMillan\"&gt;James MacMillan&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Confession%20of%20Isobel%20Gowdie\"&gt;The Confession of Isobel Gowdie&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe last twenty years has seen the gradual emergence of the BBC SSO as a fully fledged 'public' orchestra, with foreign touring, commercial recordings and concerts all over the world consolidating its position as one of the cornerstones of Scottish musical life. The BBC SSO appears annually in such festivals as the &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Proms\"&gt;BBC Proms&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20International%20Festival\"&gt;Edinburgh International Festival&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cheltenham%20Festival\"&gt;Cheltenham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Contemporary%20Music%20Festival\"&gt;Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"St%20Magnus%20Festival\"&gt;St Magnus Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Orkney. At the beginning of January 2006, the BBC SSO moved from Broadcasting House, Glasgow to the fully refurbished City Halls in Glasgow.\nFrom 2003 to 2009, the orchestra's Chief Conductor was &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i-born &lt;a href=\"Ilan%20Volkov\"&gt;Ilan Volkov&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest-ever chief conductor of any BBC orchestra. In October 2007, the orchestra announced the appointment of Edinburgh born &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Runnicles\"&gt;Donald Runnicles&lt;/a&gt; as its Chief Conductor in September 2009. Volkov took the title of principal guest conductor BBC SSO as of the 2009\u20132010 season, in parallel with the advent of Runnicles as chief conductor. In September 2011, the BBC SSO announced the extension of Runnicles' contract as chief conductor through 2015. In October 2014, the BBC SSO reported the scheduled conclusion of Runnicles' tenure as chief conductor in September 2016, at which time he is scheduled to take the title of conductor emeritus with the orchestra. In March 2015, the orchestra announced the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Dausgaard\"&gt;Thomas Dausgaard&lt;/a&gt; as its 11th chief conductor, effective with the 2016\u20132017 season. In January 2018, the BBC SSO announced the extension of Dausgaard's contract as chief conductor through the 2021\u20132022 season. Dausgaard is scheduled to conclude his chief conductorship of the BBC SSO at the close of the 2021-2022 season.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society\"&gt;Royal Philharmonic Society&lt;/a&gt; presented the BBC SSO with its award for Best Orchestra in 2002, and its then-chief conductor Ilan Volkov with the prize for Best Young Artist in 2004. In March 2014, the orchestra made its first trip to India, covering the cities of Chennai, Mumbai and New Delhi.\nRecordings.\nAs well as its regular live broadcasts and recordings for the BBC, and recordings for BBC Music Magazine, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra has recorded 98 commercial CDs for labels including BIS, NMC and &lt;a href=\"Hyperion%20Records\"&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt;, with whom it has a long association. The orchestra has gathered 4 Gramophone Awards and a Grammy nomination for its commercial recordings."
