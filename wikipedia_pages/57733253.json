The original name at launch was simply JAC Refine, later, the model was renamed to Refine M5 as a car of the luxury Refine series of &lt;a href=\"JAC%20Motors\"&gt;JAC Motors&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of 2013, the Refine MPV is offered in three trim levels, from low to high is the Chuansuo, Xianghe, and M5 series.

In the first few years of its introduction, the M5 (second generation Refine MPV) was sold alongside its predecessor.\nSecond generation (2011\u2013present).\nThe second generation Refine MPV (Refine II) or Refine M5 MPV debuted as a concept named the JAC Refine IV at the 2010 &lt;a href=\"Beijing%20Auto%20Show\"&gt;Beijing Auto Show&lt;/a&gt;.
