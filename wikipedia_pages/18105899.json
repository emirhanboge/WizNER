    "text": "The Gauliga B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren, was the highest &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; league in the parts of &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; occupied by Germany on 15 March 1939 and incorporated in the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate%20of%20Bohemia%20and%20Moravia\"&gt;Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia&lt;/a&gt; (German:\"Protectorat B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren\") from 1943 to 1945. The league only existed for one complete season.\nOverview.\nAfter the German occupation the ethnically German clubs in the \"Protectorate\" initially entered the \"&lt;a href=\"Gauliga%20Sudetenland\"&gt;Gauliga Sudetenland&lt;/a&gt;\". From 1943, a separate \"Gauliga Gauliga B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren\" was formed by the &lt;a href=\"NSRL\"&gt;NSRL&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe league was formed with fourteen clubs in two divisions. The two divisional champions then played a home-and-away final to determine the \"Gauliga\" champion. The winner of this competition qualified for the &lt;a href=\"German%20football%20champions\"&gt;German championship&lt;/a&gt;. The clubs in the league were mostly military teams, only ethnically German clubs were permitted to take part in it. Czech clubs continued to play their own &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovak%20First%20League\"&gt;Bohemia/Moravia championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe league program was severely interrupted by the war and not all games were actually played in the 1943\u201344 season.\nThe imminent collapse of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; in 1945 affected all \"Gauligas\" and its doubtful whether the 1944\u201345 season in the \"Gauliga B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren\" got under way at all. The second season of the league was meant to operate with fifteen teams in three groups.\nAftermath.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the German population of Czechoslovakia was &lt;a href=\"Expulsion%20of%20Germans%20from%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;almost completely expelled&lt;/a&gt;. Only a small minority remains in what is now the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll German football clubs were dissolved and the &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovak%20First%20League\"&gt;Czechoslovak First League&lt;/a&gt; once more became the highest level of play for the whole country, but now without any ethnically German clubs, the last of which had been relegated in &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovak%20First%20League%201935-36\"&gt;1936&lt;/a&gt; from the top division.\nWinners and runners-up of the league.\nThe winners and runners-up of the league:"
