    "text": "Ernst von Salomon (25 September 1902 \u2013 9 August 1972) was a Weimar-era national-revolutionary &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; writer and right-wing &lt;a href=\"Freikorps\"&gt;Freikorps&lt;/a&gt; member.\nFamily and education.\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein\"&gt;province of Schleswig-Holstein&lt;/a&gt;, the son of a criminal investigation officer. Salomon attended the &lt;a href=\"Musterschule\"&gt;Musterschule&lt;/a&gt; gymnasium in Frankfurt.\nMilitary service.\nFrom 1913 Salomon was raised as a cadet in &lt;a href=\"Karlsruhe\"&gt;Karlsruhe&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Lichterfelde%20%28Berlin%29\"&gt;Lichterfelde&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;; during the &lt;a href=\"German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%9319\"&gt;German Revolution of 1918\u201319&lt;/a&gt;, he joined the paramilitary \"&lt;a href=\"Freikorps\"&gt;Freikorps&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Free-Corps\") unit under &lt;a href=\"Georg%20Ludwig%20Rudolf%20Maercker\"&gt;Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker&lt;/a&gt; suppressing the &lt;a href=\"Spartacist%20Uprising\"&gt;Spartacist Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. Later in 1919, he fought in the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20region\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Bolsheviks\"&gt;Bolsheviks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Estonian%20Land%20Forces\"&gt;Estonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20National%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Latvian armies&lt;/a&gt;. With his unit he took part in the Kapp-Putsch in March 1920. He also fought against Polish insurgents in what the Poles call the &lt;a href=\"Silesian%20Uprisings\"&gt;Silesian Uprisings&lt;/a&gt; of 1921.\nPolitical activity before and during WW2.\nAfter the \"Freikorps\" units had been officially dissolved in 1920, Salomon joined the \"&lt;a href=\"Organisation%20Consul\"&gt;Organisation Consul&lt;/a&gt;\" and received a five-year prison sentence in 1922 for his part in the assassination of Foreign Minister &lt;a href=\"Walther%20Rathenau\"&gt;Walther Rathenau&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 he provided a car for the assassins. In 1927, he received another prison sentence for an attempted &lt;a href=\"Feme%20murders\"&gt;\"Feme\" murder&lt;/a&gt; (paramilitary \"self-justice\"), and was pardoned by Reich President &lt;a href=\"Paul%20von%20Hindenburg\"&gt;Paul von Hindenburg&lt;/a&gt; after a few months \u2013 he had not killed the severely wounded victim, Wagner, when he pleaded for his life, which was noted by the court.\nAfter his release from prison, Salomon committed himself to the support of \"Feme\" murder convicts and began to publish &lt;a href=\"feuilleton\"&gt;feuilleton&lt;/a&gt; articles in the national conservative \"&lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Allgemeine%20Zeitung\"&gt;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;\" newspaper, which earned him the attention of &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Revolutionary%20movement\"&gt;Conservative Revolutionary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"National%20Bolshevism\"&gt;National Bolshevist&lt;/a&gt; circles around &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Hielscher\"&gt;Friedrich Hielscher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arnolt%20Bronnen\"&gt;Arnolt Bronnen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1929, he backed his elder brother Bruno in his struggle for the Schleswig-Holstein &lt;a href=\"Rural%20People%27s%20Movement\"&gt;Rural People's Movement&lt;/a&gt; by simulating a bomb attack on the &lt;a href=\"Reichstag%20building\"&gt;Reichstag building&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin. He had to spend three months in investigative custody, during which time he finished writing his first novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Outlaws%20%28novel%29\"&gt;The Outlaws&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Die Ge\u00e4chteten\"), published by &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Rowohlt\"&gt;Ernst Rowohlt&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike many other German writers and poets, he did not sign the \"&lt;a href=\"Gel%C3%B6bnis%20treuester%20Gefolgschaft\"&gt;Gel\u00f6bnis treuester Gefolgschaft&lt;/a&gt;\" proclamation of loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt;. He had been arrested after the Nazi \"&lt;a href=\"Machtergreifung\"&gt;Machtergreifung&lt;/a&gt;\", together with &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Fallada\"&gt;Hans Fallada&lt;/a&gt;, but was released after a few days. Suspiciously eyed by the authorities, who suspected him to be an adherent of &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Strasser\"&gt;Otto Strasser&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Third Position\", he earned his living by writing film scripts for the German film company \"UFA\". Salomon wrote the screenplay for the 1941 anti-British propaganda film \"&lt;a href=\"Carl%20Peters%20%28film%29%23Context%20in%20Nazi%20propaganda\"&gt;Carl Peters&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe supported Ernst Rowohlt after he had received a publishing ban for employing Jewish personnel and temporarily corresponded with conservative &lt;a href=\"German%20resistance%20to%20Nazism\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; circles around &lt;a href=\"Arvid%20Harnack\"&gt;Arvid Harnack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harro%20Schulze-Boysen\"&gt;Harro Schulze-Boysen&lt;/a&gt;. His lover, Ille Gotthelft, was Jewish but he was able to protect her from persecution by passing her off as his spouse. In his autobiographical \"The Answers\" he described how both were arrested and seriously mistreated in 1945 by American soldiers when they were arrested, and called \"Nazi swine!\" and \"despicable creatures\". Salomon was interned by the American Military Authorities until September 1946.\nIn 1951 he published the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Questionnaire%20%28novel%20by%20Salomon%29\"&gt;The Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Der Fragebogen\"), in which he gave his ironic and sarcastic \"Answers\" to the 131 point questionnaire concerning people's activities between 1933-1945 which the Western Allied Military Governments in Germany issued by the tens of thousands at the end of the war. A famous public discussion of the book took place in the main train station of &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;, organised by bookseller &lt;a href=\"Gerhard%20Ludwig\"&gt;Gerhard Ludwig&lt;/a&gt;. Although Liberals and the Left condemned it violently, the book was a sensation in Germany and between its publication in 1951 and 1954 by which time it had sold over 250,000 copies.\nDeath.\nErnst von Salomon died of heart failure at his home near &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; on 9 August 1972. He was 69 years of age."
