Allan Hunter of \"&lt;a href=\"Screen%20International\"&gt;Screen Daily&lt;/a&gt;\" shared similar ideas, opining that the film had \"style to burn\" and that it was a \"a film of almost delirious excess\" and that noted that if it mattered if the audience doesn't care for any of the characters, finding it a \"intoxicating aspect of watching a team so in single-minded and in control of their filmmaking technique. After a while, though, it does start to ring hollow.\""
