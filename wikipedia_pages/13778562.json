    "text": "The R497 road is a &lt;a href=\"Regional%20road%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;regional road&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; which runs north-south from &lt;a href=\"Nenagh\"&gt;Nenagh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Tipperary\"&gt;County Tipperary&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"N24%20road%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;N24&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tipperary%20%28town%29\"&gt;Tipperary&lt;/a&gt; Town.\nThe entire route is in County Tipperary and is long. Part of the road is known as the Anglesey Road, named after the &lt;a href=\"Marquis%20of%20Anglesey\"&gt;Marquis of Anglesey&lt;/a&gt; who gave orders to have it built.\nJust north of the village of &lt;a href=\"Hollyford%2C%20County%20Tipperary\"&gt;Hollyford&lt;/a&gt; the road passes through Anglesey Road special area of conservation (site reference code 002125), a small site containing a variety of habitats and species found in unimproved upland grassland within the steep valley of the Multeen, a tributary of the River Suir. The main threat to the site is agricultural improvement and afforestation."
