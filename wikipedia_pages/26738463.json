    "text": "The Mus\u00e9e de l'Imprimerie is a &lt;a href=\"museum\"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt;, France, with the mission of enhancing, conserving, documenting and valuing the heritage of printed books and graphic arts.\nThe museum was inaugurated in 1964. In 2006 the \"Grand Guide Michelin France\" awarded it two stars out of three and in 2007, the museum had 16,819 visitors.\nHistory.\nThe Musee de l'Imprimerie was established in Lyon because Lyon had been a centre of printing and the book trade in Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries and the city held large historical collections of books and the graphic arts. The museum was designed by the master printer and historian &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Audin\"&gt;Maurice Audin&lt;/a&gt;, with the historian of the book, &lt;a href=\"Henri-Jean%20Martin\"&gt;Henri-Jean Martin&lt;/a&gt;, then chief curator of the Library of Lyon. There are two banners before the entrance of the H\u00f4tel de la Couronne, which hosted the meetings of the City of Lyon &lt;a href=\"aldermen\"&gt;aldermen&lt;/a&gt; from 1604 to 1655 and which is currently the headquarters of the Mus\u00e9e de l'Imprimerie, located at 13 &lt;a href=\"rue%20de%20la%20Poulaillerie\"&gt;rue de la Poulaillerie&lt;/a&gt;. In 1957 the building was given to the City of Lyon by the banking corporation, &lt;a href=\"LCL%20S.A.\"&gt;LCL S.A.&lt;/a&gt;, and on 8 June 1963 the mayor of Lyon, &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Pradel\"&gt;Louis Pradel&lt;/a&gt;, inaugurated the Mus\u00e9e de la Banque on the occasion of the centenary of LCL. Finally the current museum was opened in 1964.\nAlan Marshall, a former printer, was its director until May 2015. He was replaced, in summer 2015, by Joseph Belletante, researcher in media history.\nThe museum has works by early printers of Lyon, including Martin Husz, &lt;a href=\"Jodocus%20Badius\"&gt;Josse Bade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A9bastien%20Gryphe\"&gt;S\u00e9bastien Gryphe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Etienne%20Dolet\"&gt;Etienne Dolet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jean%20de%20Tournes\"&gt;Jean de Tournes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guillaume%20Rouill%C3%A9\"&gt;Guillaume Rouill\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and Bernard Salomon. It shows the beginnings of Western printing from the fifteenth century - including examples of the work of &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Pannartz%20and%20Konrad%20Sweynheim\"&gt;Sweynheim and Pannartz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aldus%20Manutius\"&gt;Aldus Manutius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Froben\"&gt;Johann Froben&lt;/a&gt;, the Estiennes and Christopher Plantin - to the twentieth century. It includes displays of the 20th-century inventions, &lt;a href=\"Rene%20Alphonse%20Higonnet\"&gt;Higonnet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Moyroud\"&gt;Moyroud&lt;/a&gt;'s Lumitype-Photon phototypesetter and the BBR system of computer typesetting."
