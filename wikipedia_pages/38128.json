    "text": "The Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality (also called Cauchy\u2013Bunyakovsky\u2013Schwarz inequality) is considered one of the most important and widely used &lt;a href=\"Inequality%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;inequalities&lt;/a&gt; in mathematics.\nThe inequality for sums was published by . The corresponding inequality for integrals was published by and . Schwarz gave the modern proof of the integral version.\nStatement of the inequality.\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors formula_1 and formula_2 of an &lt;a href=\"inner%20product%20space\"&gt;inner product space&lt;/a&gt; it is true that\nwhere formula_3 is the &lt;a href=\"inner%20product\"&gt;inner product&lt;/a&gt;. Examples of inner products include the real and complex &lt;a href=\"dot%20product\"&gt;dot product&lt;/a&gt;; see the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20product%20space%23Some%20examples\"&gt;examples in inner product&lt;/a&gt;. Every inner product gives rise to a &lt;a href=\"Norm%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;norm&lt;/a&gt;, called the or &lt;a href=\"inner%20product%20space%23Norm\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where the norm of a vector formula_1 is denoted and defined by:\nformula_5\nso that this norm and the inner product are related by the defining condition formula_6 where formula_7 is always a non-negative real number (even if the inner product is complex-valued). \nBy taking the square root of both sides of the above inequality, the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality can be written in its more familiar form:\nMoreover, the two sides are equal if and only if formula_1 and formula_2 are &lt;a href=\"linear%20independence\"&gt;linearly dependent&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial cases.\nSedrakyan's lemma - Positive real numbers.\n&lt;a href=\"Sedrakyan%27s%20inequality\"&gt;Sedrakyan's inequality&lt;/a&gt;, also called &lt;a href=\"Harald%20Bergstr%C3%B6m\"&gt;Bergstr\u00f6m&lt;/a&gt;'s inequality, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Engel%20%28mathematician%29\"&gt;Engel&lt;/a&gt;'s form, the T2 lemma, or &lt;a href=\"Titu%20Andreescu\"&gt;Titu&lt;/a&gt;'s lemma, states that for positive reals:\nformula_10\nIt is a direct consequence of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, obtained by using the &lt;a href=\"dot%20product\"&gt;dot product&lt;/a&gt; on formula_11 upon substituting formula_12 This form is especially helpful when the inequality involves fractions where the numerator is a &lt;a href=\"Square%20number\"&gt;perfect square&lt;/a&gt;.\nR2 - The plane.\nThe real vector space formula_13 denotes the 2-dimensional plane. It is also the 2-dimensional &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20space\"&gt;Euclidean space&lt;/a&gt; where the inner product is the &lt;a href=\"dot%20product\"&gt;dot product&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf formula_14 and formula_15 then the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality becomes:\nformula_16\nwhere formula_17 is the &lt;a href=\"angle\"&gt;angle&lt;/a&gt; between formula_18 and formula_19\nThe form above is perhaps the easiest in which to understand the inequality, since the square of the cosine can be at most 1, which occurs when the vectors are in the same or opposite directions. It can also be restated in terms of the vector coordinates formula_20 as\nformula_21\nwhere equality holds if and only if the vector formula_22 is in the same or opposite direction as the vector formula_23 or if one of them is the zero vector.\nR\"n\" - \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20space\"&gt;Euclidean space&lt;/a&gt; formula_11 with the standard inner product, which is the &lt;a href=\"dot%20product\"&gt;dot product&lt;/a&gt;, the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality becomes:\nformula_25\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality can be proved using only ideas from elementary algebra in this case. \nConsider the following &lt;a href=\"quadratic%20polynomial\"&gt;quadratic polynomial&lt;/a&gt; in formula_26\nformula_27\nSince it is nonnegative, it has at most one real root for formula_28 hence its &lt;a href=\"discriminant\"&gt;discriminant&lt;/a&gt; is less than or equal to zero. That is,\nformula_29\nwhich yields the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality.\nC\"n\" - \"n\"-dimensional Complex space.\nIf formula_30 with formula_31 and formula_32 (where formula_33 and formula_34) and if the inner product on the vector space formula_35 is the canonical complex inner product (defined by formula_36 where the bar notation is used for &lt;a href=\"Complex%20conjugate\"&gt;complex conjugation&lt;/a&gt;), then the inequality may be restated more explicitly as follows: \nformula_37\nThat is,\nformula_38\n\"L\"2.\nFor the inner product space of &lt;a href=\"square-integrable\"&gt;square-integrable&lt;/a&gt; complex-valued &lt;a href=\"function%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;functions&lt;/a&gt;, the following inequality:\nformula_39\nThe &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B6lder%20inequality\"&gt;H\u00f6lder inequality&lt;/a&gt; is a generalization of this.\nApplications.\nAnalysis.\nIn any &lt;a href=\"inner%20product%20space\"&gt;inner product space&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"triangle%20inequality\"&gt;triangle inequality&lt;/a&gt; is a consequence of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, as is now shown: \nformula_40\nTaking square roots gives the triangle inequality:\nformula_41\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality is used to prove that the inner product is a &lt;a href=\"continuous%20function\"&gt;continuous function&lt;/a&gt; with respect to the &lt;a href=\"topology\"&gt;topology&lt;/a&gt; induced by the inner product itself.\nGeometry.\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality allows one to extend the notion of \"angle between two vectors\" to any &lt;a href=\"real%20numbers\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; inner-product space by defining:\nformula_42\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality proves that this definition is sensible, by showing that the right-hand side lies in the interval and justifies the notion that (real) &lt;a href=\"Hilbert%20space\"&gt;Hilbert space&lt;/a&gt;s are simply generalizations of the &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20space\"&gt;Euclidean space&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be used to define an angle in &lt;a href=\"complex%20numbers\"&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"inner-product%20space\"&gt;inner-product space&lt;/a&gt;s, by taking the absolute value or the real part of the right-hand side, as is done when extracting a metric from &lt;a href=\"Fidelity%20of%20quantum%20states\"&gt;quantum fidelity&lt;/a&gt;.\nProbability theory.\nLet formula_43 and formula_44 be &lt;a href=\"random%20variable\"&gt;random variable&lt;/a&gt;s, then the covariance inequality: is given by\nformula_45\nAfter defining an inner product on the set of random variables using the expectation of their product,\nformula_46\nthe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality becomes\nformula_47\nTo prove the covariance inequality using the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, let formula_48 and formula_49 then\nformula_50\nwhere formula_51 denotes &lt;a href=\"variance\"&gt;variance&lt;/a&gt; and formula_52 denotes &lt;a href=\"covariance\"&gt;covariance&lt;/a&gt;.\nProofs.\nThere are many different proofs of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality other than those given below. \nWhen consulting other sources, there are often two sources of confusion. First, some authors define to be linear in the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20product%20space%23Alternative%20definitions%2C%20notations%20and%20remarks\"&gt;second argument&lt;/a&gt; rather than the first. \nSecond, some proofs are only valid when the field is formula_53 and not formula_54\nThis section gives proofs of the following theorem:\nMoreover, if formula_55 and formula_56 then formula_57 \nIn all of the proofs given below, the proof in the trivial case where at least one of the vectors is zero (or equivalently, in the case where formula_58) is the same. It is presented immediately below only once to reduce repetition. It also includes the easy part of the proof the &lt;a href=\"%23Characterization%20of%20Equality%20in%20Cauchy-Schwarz\"&gt;Equality Characterization&lt;/a&gt; given above; that is, it proves that if formula_1 and formula_2 are linearly dependent then formula_61 \nBy definition, formula_1 and formula_2 are linearly dependent if and only if one is a scalar multiple of the other. \nIf formula_64 where formula_65 is some scalar then \nformula_66\nwhich shows that equality holds in the . \nThe case where formula_67 for some scalar formula_65 is very similar, with the main difference between the complex conjugation of formula_69\nformula_70 \nIf at least one of formula_1 and formula_2 is the zero vector then formula_1 and formula_2 are necessarily linearly dependent (just scalar multiply the non-zero vector by the number formula_75 to get the zero vector; for example, if formula_76 then let formula_77 so that formula_64), which proves the converse of this characterization in this special case; that is, this shows that if at least one of formula_1 and formula_2 is formula_81 then the &lt;a href=\"%23Characterization%20of%20Equality%20in%20Cauchy-Schwarz\"&gt;Equality Characterization&lt;/a&gt; holds. \nIf formula_82 which happens if and only if formula_83 then formula_84 and formula_85 so that in particular, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds because both sides of it are formula_86 \nThe proof in the case of formula_87 is identical. \nConsequently, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality only needs to be proven only for non-zero vectors and also only the non-trivial direction of the &lt;a href=\"%23Characterization%20of%20Equality%20in%20Cauchy-Schwarz\"&gt;Equality Characterization&lt;/a&gt; must be shown. \nFor real inner product spaces.\nLet formula_88 be a real inner product space. Consider an arbitrary pair formula_89 and the function formula_90 defined by formula_91 \nSince the inner product is positive-definite, formula_92 only takes non-negative values. On the other hand, formula_92 can be expanded using the bilinearity of the inner product and using the fact that formula_94 for real inner products:\nformula_95 \nThus, formula_96 is a polynomial of degree formula_97 (unless formula_98 which is a case that can be independently verified). Since the sign of formula_96 does not change, the discriminant of this polynomial must be non-positive:\nformula_100\nThe conclusion follows.\nFor the equality case, notice that formula_101 happens if and only if formula_102 If formula_103 then formula_104 and hence formula_105\nProof for the dot product.\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the case where the inner product is the &lt;a href=\"dot%20product\"&gt;dot product&lt;/a&gt; on formula_11 is now proven.\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality may be rewritten as formula_107 or equivalently, formula_108 for formula_109 which expands to:\nformula_110 \nTo simplify, let \nformula_111\nso that the statement that remains to be to proven can be written as formula_112 which can be rearranged to formula_113 The &lt;a href=\"discriminant\"&gt;discriminant&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"quadratic%20equation\"&gt;quadratic equation&lt;/a&gt; formula_114 is formula_115 \nTherefore, to complete the proof it is sufficient to prove that this quadratic either has no real roots or exactly one real root, because this will imply: \nformula_116\nSubstituting the values of formula_117 into formula_114 gives:\nformula_119\nwhich is a sum of terms that are each formula_120 by the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Trivial_Inequality\"&gt;trivial inequality:&lt;/a&gt; formula_121 for all formula_122 \nThis proves the inequality and so to finish the proof, it remains to show that equality is achievable.\nThe equality formula_123 is the equality case for Cauchy-Schwarz after inspecting \nformula_124\nwhich proves that equality is achievable. formula_125\nFor arbitrary vector spaces.\nProof 1.\nThe special case of formula_87 was proven above so it is henceforth assumed that formula_127 \nAs is now shown, the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz equality (and the rest of the theorem) is an almost immediate corollary of the following : \nwhich is readily verified by elementarily expanding formula_128 (via the definition of the norm) and then simplifying (details are given below). \nBecause the left hand side of is non-negative, so is the right hand side, which proves that formula_129 from which the follows (by taking the square root of both sides). \nIf formula_55 then the right hand side (and thus also the left hand side) of is formula_131 which is only possible if formula_132 \nthus formula_133 which shows that formula_1 and formula_2 are linearly dependent. formula_125\nLet formula_137 and formula_138 so that formula_139 and formula_140 \nThen\nformula_141\nThis expansion does not require formula_2 to be non-zero; however, formula_2 must be non-zero in order to divide both sides by formula_144 and to deduce the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality from it. \nSwapping formula_1 and formula_2 gives rise to:\nformula_147\nand thus\nformula_148\nProof 2.\nThe special case of formula_87 was proven above so it is henceforth assumed that formula_127 \nLet\nformula_151\nIt follows from the linearity of the inner product in its first argument that:\nformula_152\nTherefore, formula_153 is a vector orthogonal to the vector formula_2 (Indeed, formula_153 is the &lt;a href=\"vector%20projection\"&gt;projection&lt;/a&gt; of formula_1 onto the plane orthogonal to formula_157) We can thus apply the &lt;a href=\"Pythagorean%20theorem%23Inner%20product%20spaces\"&gt;Pythagorean theorem&lt;/a&gt; to\nformula_158\nwhich gives\nformula_159\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality follows by multiplying by formula_144 and then taking the square root. \nMoreover, if the relation formula_161 in the above expression is actually an equality, then formula_162 and hence formula_163 the definition of formula_153 then establishes a relation of linear dependence between formula_1 and formula_157 The converse was proved at the beginning of this section, so the proof is complete. formula_125\nGeneralizations.\nVarious generalizations of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality exist. &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B6lder%27s%20inequality\"&gt;H\u00f6lder's inequality&lt;/a&gt; generalizes it to formula_168 norms. More generally, it can be interpreted as a special case of the definition of the norm of a linear operator on a &lt;a href=\"Banach%20space\"&gt;Banach space&lt;/a&gt; (Namely, when the space is a &lt;a href=\"Hilbert%20space\"&gt;Hilbert space&lt;/a&gt;). Further generalizations are in the context of &lt;a href=\"operator%20theory\"&gt;operator theory&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. for operator-convex functions and &lt;a href=\"operator%20algebra\"&gt;operator algebra&lt;/a&gt;s, where the domain and/or range are replaced by a &lt;a href=\"C%2A-algebra\"&gt;C*-algebra&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"W%2A-algebra\"&gt;W*-algebra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn inner product can be used to define a &lt;a href=\"positive%20linear%20functional\"&gt;positive linear functional&lt;/a&gt;. For example, given a Hilbert space formula_169 being a finite measure, the standard inner product gives rise to a positive functional formula_170 by formula_171 Conversely, every positive linear functional formula_170 on formula_173 can be used to define an inner product formula_174 where formula_175 is the &lt;a href=\"Pointwise%20product\"&gt;pointwise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"complex%20conjugate\"&gt;complex conjugate&lt;/a&gt; of formula_176 In this language, the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality becomes\nformula_177\nwhich extends verbatim to positive functionals on C*-algebras:\nThe next two theorems are further examples in operator algebra.\nThis extends the fact formula_178 when formula_170 is a linear functional. The case when formula_180 is self-adjoint, that is, formula_181 is sometimes known as Kadison's inequality.\nAnother generalization is a refinement obtained by interpolating between both sides of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: \nThis theorem can be deduced from &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B6lder%27s%20inequality\"&gt;H\u00f6lder's inequality&lt;/a&gt;. There are also non commutative versions for operators and tensor products of matrices."
