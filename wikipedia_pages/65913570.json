    "text": "The progressive Muslim vote refers to the support that the majority of Muslims make in the West for electoral options of the &lt;a href=\"political%20left\"&gt;political left&lt;/a&gt;. Different demographic and statistical studies have shown a consistent tendency for Muslims in &lt;a href=\"Western%20countries\"&gt;Western countries&lt;/a&gt; to vote for &lt;a href=\"Progressivism\"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; parties, usually &lt;a href=\"social%20democrats\"&gt;social democrats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"socialists\"&gt;socialists&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"social%20liberals\"&gt;social liberals&lt;/a&gt;. This despite the fact that most Western Muslims tend to be &lt;a href=\"socially%20conservative\"&gt;socially conservative&lt;/a&gt;, and thus opposed to certain issues often supported by the left such as &lt;a href=\"LGBT%20rights\"&gt;LGBT rights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"feminism\"&gt;feminism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;. This phenomenon has been analyzed by different scholars and academics.\nAnalysis.\nFor some scholars, despite the differences on cultural and moral issues with the left, and the &lt;a href=\"secularism\"&gt;secularism&lt;/a&gt; normally associated with it, Muslims as voters are attracted to progressive parties for different reasons:\nHowever, some polls have shown that although international issues are important for Muslim voters, they are not decisive since they are more concerned with other things that are closer to home, such as the fight against &lt;a href=\"xenophobia\"&gt;xenophobia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"economic%20policies\"&gt;economic policies&lt;/a&gt;.\nRafaela Dancygier from &lt;a href=\"Princeton%20University\"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; mentions that the majority of Muslims in Europe are small business owners and micro-entrepreneurs who would not necessarily agree with left-wing policies such as tax increases and the &lt;a href=\"welfare%20state\"&gt;welfare state&lt;/a&gt;, so they would normally be akin to conservative center-right parties, the fact that they are not shows the failure of the &lt;a href=\"center-right\"&gt;center-right&lt;/a&gt; to attract the Islamic voter out of fear of alienating its Christian base.\nJonathan Lawrence of &lt;a href=\"Boston%20College\"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, argues that the left's association with Muslims is natural, since in the West, the majority of Muslims are &lt;a href=\"working-class\"&gt;working-class&lt;/a&gt; and of low socioeconomic status, and that the workers' parties have realized this long ago, however, another important base of progressive voters is a liberal, secular and progressive &lt;a href=\"middle%20class\"&gt;middle class&lt;/a&gt; who believe in &lt;a href=\"multiculturalism\"&gt;multiculturalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"secularism\"&gt;secularism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"LGBT%20rights\"&gt;LGBT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20rights\"&gt;women's rights&lt;/a&gt; that are not shared by the majority of Muslims, which has made it difficult for the left to balance these two bases. For on the one hand they must please their more conservative Muslim constituencies and on the other their secular middle-class base.\nNevertheless, as Lawrence points out, this &lt;a href=\"progressivism\"&gt;progressivism&lt;/a&gt; is paradoxical and is not always transmitted in the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20world\"&gt;Islamic world&lt;/a&gt; itself. Although the majority of voters in the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20diaspora\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tunisian%20diaspora\"&gt;Tunisian diaspora&lt;/a&gt; supported progressive parties in their countries of residence when they cast their vote abroad in the elections in &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;, they mostly supported conservative parties such as &lt;a href=\"Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan\"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Justice%20and%20Development%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;Justice and Development Party&lt;/a&gt; in Turkey and the Tunisian &lt;a href=\"Ennahda\"&gt;Ennahda&lt;/a&gt; party respectively.\nUnited States and Canada.\nIn the United States, the majority of Muslims vote for the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;. Although the distribution between Democrats and Republicans among the non-black Muslim community in the United States used to be more even, with 50% of Muslims defining themselves as conservative and 30% as liberals, this changed after the &lt;a href=\"September%2011%20attacks\"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent policies of &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20War\"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; unpopular among Muslims. For example, only 7% of &lt;a href=\"American%20Muslims\"&gt;American Muslims&lt;/a&gt; voted for Bush in &lt;a href=\"2004%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;. Muslim support was also the majority in favor of &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2012%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hillary%20Clinton\"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2016%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. By 2018 only 10% of Muslims voted for the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; despite being socially conservative. In 2020, 69% of Muslims supported Democrat &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Biden\"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;, although it was a slight decrease from the 82% who supported Hillary Clinton four years prior, this despite the fact that many of &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;'s measures were unpopular within Muslims, such as the ban on the entry of immigrants from seven Islamic countries and the passage of the US embassy to &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. The only Muslim representives in the United States Congress are from the Democratic Party (as of 2021, no US Senators to date have been Muslim).\nIn Canada, the Muslim community votes overwhelmingly for the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;New Democratic&lt;/a&gt; parties. In 2011 46% of &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20Canadians\"&gt;Muslim Canadians&lt;/a&gt; had voted for the Liberals, with 38% for the NDP and only 12% for the Conservative. This support plummeted to 2% in 2015 when 65% of Muslims voted for the Liberal Party and 10% for the NPD.\nEurope.\nA 2015 poll showed that 64% of &lt;a href=\"British%20Muslims\"&gt;British Muslims&lt;/a&gt; voted for the &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to 25% who voted &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Islamophobia%20in%20the%20UK%20Conservative%20Party%20%281997%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;Conservative Party has been accused of Islamophobic&lt;/a&gt; positions even by &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Johnson\"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, 85% of Muslims voted for the Labour Party and only 11% for Conservatives. Notable figures in &lt;a href=\"British%20politics\"&gt;British politics&lt;/a&gt; who are Muslim include &lt;a href=\"Sadiq%20Khan\"&gt;Sadiq Khan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20London\"&gt;Mayor of London&lt;/a&gt; a Muslim and Labour member.\n86% of &lt;a href=\"French%20Muslims\"&gt;French Muslims&lt;/a&gt; supported &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Party%20%28France%29\"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2012%20French%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;. The Muslim support for both Hollande and later &lt;a href=\"Beno%C3%AEt%20Hamon\"&gt;Beno\u00eet Hamon&lt;/a&gt; alongside left-wing candidate &lt;a href=\"Jean-Luc%20M%C3%A9lenchon\"&gt;Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon&lt;/a&gt; is also in the majority with only 15% supporting right-wing candidates. Similarly in &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; a 2016 study by the Experts Council on Immigration and Integration found that the majority of &lt;a href=\"Turks%20in%20Germany\"&gt;Turks in Germany&lt;/a&gt; were Social Democrats with 41% of these backing the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Social Democratic Party of Germany&lt;/a&gt;, 27% to the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Christian Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt;, 13% to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%2090/The%20Greens\"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt;, 13% to &lt;a href=\"The%20Left%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;The Left&lt;/a&gt; and 7% others, contrasted with the non-Turkish population that supported the &lt;a href=\"CDU/CSU\"&gt;CDU/CSU&lt;/a&gt; 40%, 27% the Social Democrats, 13% to the greens, 9% to the Left and 9% others.\nIn the Netherlands most Muslims voted by the &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;. When three Muslim &lt;a href=\"Members%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Members of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; quit the Labour Party and founded their own, the &lt;a href=\"Denk%20%28political%20party%29\"&gt;Denk Party&lt;/a&gt;, the Labor Party saw a reduction on its support and lost seats. In Sweden among 70 to 75% of &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Muslims\"&gt;Swedish Muslims&lt;/a&gt; are estimated to support the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Social%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, whilst 10 to 15% support other parties of the &lt;a href=\"red%E2%80%93green%20alliance\"&gt;red\u2013green alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAsia.\nIn non-Muslim Asia the case is similar. &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Muslims\"&gt;Indian Muslims&lt;/a&gt; tend to vote more frequently for center-left &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt; and its allies, with 43% of support as of 2019. The biggest support came from &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt; with 99% of Muslims voting for the INC and the smallest from &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt; where it was 15%. Only 8% of Mulslims voted for the right-wing &lt;a href=\"Bharatiya%20Janata%20Party\"&gt;Bharatiya Janata Party&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2019%20Indian%20general%20election\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, 1% more than in the last election. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, the Arab parties are generally classified as left-leaning. Of the &lt;a href=\"Joint%20List\"&gt;Joint List&lt;/a&gt;, the major coalition of Arab parties, its members are classified as left-wing; &lt;a href=\"Balad%20%28political%20party%29\"&gt;Balad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hadash\"&gt;Hadash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ta%27al\"&gt;Ta'al&lt;/a&gt; with former member &lt;a href=\"United%20Arab%20List\"&gt;United Arab List&lt;/a&gt; being described as &lt;a href=\"Big%20Tent\"&gt;Big Tent&lt;/a&gt;, with some socially conservative and &lt;a href=\"Islamist\"&gt;Islamist&lt;/a&gt; factions. In 2015, The Joint List received 82% of &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Israelis\"&gt;Arab Israelis&lt;/a&gt; support followed by social democratic &lt;a href=\"Zionist%20Union\"&gt;Zionist Union&lt;/a&gt; with 22% and &lt;a href=\"Likud\"&gt;Likud&lt;/a&gt; with 15%."
