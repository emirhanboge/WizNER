Thompson of \"&lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20%28website%29\"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;\" opined that \"[In] 'The Way Life Goes,' which is produced by Don Cannon and Ike Beatz, Uzi opens with a brief introduction to the other half of his failed relationship, punctuated with, \"I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her.\" From there, he launches into a full interpolation of the first verse from Oh Wonder's \"Landslide\": \"I know it hurts sometimes, but you\u2019ll get over it/You\u2019ll find another life to live.\" Uzi's less interested in the granular drama of the breakup than in the fallout, the moment three or four days later when reality starts to set in.\"\nPersonnel.\nCredits adapted from YouTube and Tidal."
