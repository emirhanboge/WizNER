    "text": "The Primera Divisi\u00f3n (; (), named Torneo Socios.com () since 2021 for sponsorship reasons, is a professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; league in Argentina, organised by the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Argentine Football Association&lt;/a&gt; (AFA).\nThe Primera Divisi\u00f3n is the country's premier football division and is the top division of the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Argentine football league system&lt;/a&gt;. It operates on a system of &lt;a href=\"promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;promotion and relegation&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;Primera Nacional&lt;/a&gt; (Second Division), with the teams placed lowest at the end of the season being relegated. Since 2020, relegation has been suspended due to &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the first championship held in &lt;a href=\"1891%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1891&lt;/a&gt;, Argentina became the first country outside the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (where the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; had debuted in &lt;a href=\"1888%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League\"&gt;1888&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20Football%20League\"&gt;Irish Football League&lt;/a&gt;s in 1890) to establish a football league. In the early years, only teams from &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires%20Province\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Greater Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"La%20Plata\"&gt;La Plata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rosario%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;Rosario&lt;/a&gt; were affiliated to the national association. Teams from other cities would join in later years.\nThe Primera Divisi\u00f3n turned professional in &lt;a href=\"1931%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1931&lt;/a&gt; when 18 clubs broke away from the amateur leagues to form a professional one. Since then, the season has been contested annually in four different formats and calendars.\nThe Argentine championship was ranked in the top 10 as one of the strongest leagues in the world (for 1 January 2015 \u2013 31 December 2015 period) by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Federation%20of%20Football%20History%20%26amp%3B%20Statistics\"&gt;International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics&lt;/a&gt; (IFFHS). Argentina placed 4th after &lt;a href=\"La%20Liga\"&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt; (Spain), &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; (Italy), and &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; (Germany).\nFormat and teams.\nChampionship.\nThe 2022 season will be contested by 28 teams, including the 26 teams from the &lt;a href=\"2022%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;previous season&lt;/a&gt; (so there were no &lt;a href=\"promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;relegations&lt;/a&gt; during in 2021) plus the two teams promoted from &lt;a href=\"Primera%20Nacional\"&gt;Primera Nacional&lt;/a&gt;. The season will run from June to October 2022, prior to the &lt;a href=\"2022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2022 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Qatar\"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nParticipating teams will play each other in a &lt;a href=\"round-robin%20tournament\"&gt;round-robin system&lt;/a&gt; totalising 27 rounds. The team with most points at the end of the season, will be crowned champion. Unlike the previous two seasons, the 2021 championship will bring back the relegation system, after it had been suspended due to &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Argentina\"&gt;covid-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelegation.\nRelegation is based on an &lt;a href=\"average\"&gt;averaging&lt;/a&gt; system. At the end of the season, the three teams with the worst three-year averages are relegated, while the winner and runner-up of Primera Nacional championship are promoted to Primera. Since 2020, the relegation has been suspended due to &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;\nDomestic cups.\nThe Primera Divisi\u00f3n champion gains a place to play the &lt;a href=\"Supercopa%20Argentina\"&gt;Supercopa Argentina&lt;/a&gt; v. the winner of &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Argentina\"&gt;Copa Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.\nA new edition of the Copa de la Liga Profesional (renamed \"Copa Diego Maradona\") will be held in 2021, starting on 14 February. The championship will be contested by 26 teams (24 from the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;previous edition&lt;/a&gt; plus 2 promoted from &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;Primera B Nacional&lt;/a&gt;), divided into two zones of 13 teams each. The championship will run under a &lt;a href=\"round-robin%20tournament\"&gt;single round-robin&lt;/a&gt; format, with the first 4 teams of each zone qualifying to the next stage (quarterfinals), where they played under a &lt;a href=\"single-elimination%20tournament\"&gt;single elimination&lt;/a&gt; format. Winning teams will advance to semifinals and the best two will play the final that will decide the champion of the season.\nThe final would be held on 30 May before the beginning of &lt;a href=\"2021%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt;. As previous editions of Argentine tournaments, none club will be relegated to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;Primera B Nacional&lt;/a&gt;. The winner of this cup will qualify to &lt;a href=\"2022%20Copa%20Libertadores\"&gt;2022 Copa Libertadores&lt;/a&gt; as \"Argentina 2\".\nInternational cups.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;2018\u201319&lt;/a&gt;, five teams from Argentina are eligible to play the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Libertadores\"&gt;Copa Libertadores&lt;/a&gt;. The champion of Primera Divisi\u00f3n automatically qualifies for the tournament. The other three teams best placed in the table at the end of the tournament (2nd to 4th) are also eligible to play the Cup (2nd and 3rd for group stage, and the 4th for second stage).\nFor the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Sudamericana\"&gt;Copa Sudamericana&lt;/a&gt;, six teams are eligible. Clubs placed 6th to 11th in the table at the end of the tournament, gain a place to play the cup.\nHistory.\nRound-robin tournaments (1891\u20131966).\nIn 1891 the \"Association Argentine Football League\" was established, with Alex Lamont of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Andrew%27s%20Scots%20School\"&gt;St. Andrew's Scots School&lt;/a&gt; as one of its board members. The AAFL was the first football league outside of the British Isles., to establish a football league. The first Primera Divisi\u00f3n matches were played on 12 April 1891: Buenos Aires FC vs. &lt;a href=\"St.%20Andrew%27s%20Athletic%20Club\"&gt;St. Andrew's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Caledonians%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Old Caledonians&lt;/a&gt; vs. Belgrano FC.\nA single double &lt;a href=\"round-robin%20tournament\"&gt;round-robin tournament&lt;/a&gt; was played each year, and the team with the most points was crowned as champion, except for &lt;a href=\"1936%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1936&lt;/a&gt;, during that year the winners of \"Copa de Honor\" and the \"Campeonato\" played a match for the championship title. The single tournament arrangement lasted until 1966.\nDuring this period, the traditional \"&lt;a href=\"Big%20Five%20%28Argentine%20football%29\"&gt;Big Five&lt;/a&gt;\" clubs, namely, &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate\"&gt;River Plate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boca%20Juniors\"&gt;Boca Juniors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Independiente\"&gt;Independiente&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Racing%20Club%20de%20Avellaneda\"&gt;Racing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Lorenzo%20de%20Almagro\"&gt;San Lorenzo&lt;/a&gt; dominated Argentine football. No other team besides them had won the league championship in these 36 years. The most serious title challenge came from &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Banfield\"&gt;Banfield&lt;/a&gt; in 1951, when they gained the same points with Racing Club in the league table. However, they lost 1\u20130 in the two-legged first place playoffs and gave the title to Racing.\nThe &lt;a href=\"average\"&gt;averaging&lt;/a&gt; system for relegations was implemented for the first time in the &lt;a href=\"1957%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1957&lt;/a&gt; championship, with &lt;a href=\"Ferro%20Carril%20Oeste\"&gt;Ferro Carril Oeste&lt;/a&gt; becoming the first team to be relegated under that system. Averaging continued until &lt;a href=\"1963%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt;, when the championship returned to its old format (with the worst placed teams being relegated). Nevertheless, there were no relegations until &lt;a href=\"1967%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1967&lt;/a&gt; (with &lt;a href=\"Uni%C3%B3n%20de%20Santa%20Fe\"&gt;Uni\u00f3n (SF)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deportivo%20Espa%C3%B1ol\"&gt;Deportivo Espa\u00f1ol&lt;/a&gt; being sent to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;Primera B&lt;/a&gt; after playing a relegation tournament contested by teams of First and Second divisions to define the promotions and relegations).\nMetropolitano and Nacional (1967\u20131985).\nIn 1967, the single tournament format was abandoned and replaced by two championships in each year: the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitano%20championship\"&gt;Metropolitano&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nacional%20championship\"&gt;Nacional&lt;/a&gt;. The Metropolitano only allowed clubs competing the old tournament to participate, while the Nacional was open to teams from regional tournaments. The format of competition was also altered, with the double round-robin tournament replaced by the two-group championship Metropolitano and single round-robin Nacional in that year.\nThis change brought about a revolution in Argentine football, as small teams, like &lt;a href=\"Estudiantes%20de%20La%20Plata\"&gt;Estudiantes de La Plata&lt;/a&gt; at first, and &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20V%C3%A9lez%20Sarsfield\"&gt;V\u00e9lez Sarsfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chacarita%20Juniors\"&gt;Chacarita Juniors&lt;/a&gt; and others in later years, broke down the hegemony of the five clubs who had won all the championships up to that date.\nBetween 1967 and 1969, the Metropolitano and Nacional had gone through several format changes. In the first three years, the Metropolitano was a two-group championship, with the best two teams from each group competing the semi-finals of the knock-out stage.\nThe six best teams of each group would advance to the Nacional, with four more teams coming from regional tournaments, to compete for the Nacional championship in a single round-robin format. The seventh and eighth team of each group, alongside four teams from regional tournaments, played the Promocional tournament, which, in 1969, was replaced by the Petit tournament contested without regional teams. The ninth to twelfth teams of each group entered the Reclasificatorio tournament to determine the relegating teams.\nIn 1970, the format of the Metropolitano and Nacional underwent a reform. Since that year, and until 1985, the Nacional had become a group tournament with playoffs, while the Metropolitano had been competed under a single or double round-robin system, except for the 1974, 1976 and 1979 edition, which were also contested as a group tournament with playoffs.\nDespite the format change in 1970, teams still entered the Nacional championship, Petit tournament and Reclasificatorio tournament according to their rankings in the Metropolitano in that year. However, in 1971, the tournaments were separated. Teams did not enter the Nacional by finishing at the top ranks of Metropolitano. On the other hand, the Petit tournament and Reclasificatorio tournament were abandoned. The Metropolitano and Nacional became two truly individual tournaments. Although the old system was reused in 1972, the separation was instituted again in 1973 and was adopted throughout the remaining Metropolitano and Nacional era.\nThe Metropolitano was always played first, until the order of the tournaments was reversed in 1982.\nAfter 20 years since the last time it had been used, the average system for relegations returned in the &lt;a href=\"1983%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1983 Metropolitano&lt;/a&gt; championship, two years after &lt;a href=\"San%20Lorenzo%20de%20Almagro\"&gt;San Lorenzo&lt;/a&gt; was relegated. That year, &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate\"&gt;River Plate&lt;/a&gt; finished 18\u00b0 out of 19 teams and would have been relegated under the old system, along with &lt;a href=\"Racing%20de%20C%C3%B3rdoba\"&gt;Racing de C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt;. The first teams to be relegated on average were &lt;a href=\"Racing%20Club%20de%20Avellaneda\"&gt;Racing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Nueva%20Chicago\"&gt;Nueva Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Boca%20Juniors\"&gt;Boca Juniors&lt;/a&gt; was also struggling at that time and had a dismal &lt;a href=\"1984%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; season. These facts have led to speculation that the averaging system was instituted to minimize the chance of big teams being relegated.\nEuropean-styled seasons (1985\u20131991).\nFollowing the advice of &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina national football team&lt;/a&gt;'s then coach &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Salvador%20Bilardo\"&gt;Carlos Salvador Bilardo&lt;/a&gt;, the structure of play was modified in 1985. Traditionally, like other countries in Southern Hemisphere, football season began and ended according to the calendar year. However, upon the reform, European style season was adopted for the first time among all the South American countries. Moreover, instead of holding two championships every year, only one double &lt;a href=\"round-robin%20tournament\"&gt;round-robin tournament&lt;/a&gt; was contested, like football leagues in Europe. The team topping the table at the end of season was crowned the champion.\nIn 1985, after the Nacional was played, the Metropolitano was not held, while the new single tournament (1985/86) was played for the first time.\nIn 1988\u201389 season, three points were given to match winners. If a draw occurred, &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty shootout&lt;/a&gt; was taken place and the winner of the shootout would get two points while the loser still had one. This format was waived in the following season.\nApertura and Clausura (1991\u20132012).\nFive years later, the single championship was split into two single-round tournaments, giving birth to the &lt;a href=\"Apertura%20and%20Clausura%20in%20Argentine%20football\"&gt;Apertura and Clausura&lt;/a&gt; arrangement. In 1991 the two champions played winner-take-all matches. This practice was very controversial, especially since one of the biggest teams, &lt;a href=\"Boca%20Juniors\"&gt;Boca Juniors&lt;/a&gt;, lost the finals against &lt;a href=\"Newell%27s%20Old%20Boys\"&gt;Newell's Old Boys&lt;/a&gt;, costing them their first official championship since 1981 despite an unbeaten run in the \"Clausura\". In 1992 the game was held as well (this time between &lt;a href=\"Newell%27s%20Old%20Boys\"&gt;Newell's Old Boys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate\"&gt;River Plate&lt;/a&gt;), but regardless of the result (which favored &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate\"&gt;River Plate&lt;/a&gt;) both teams were awarded the title of \"Champion\". After 1992, the practice was quickly abandoned, so that two champions (on equal footing) were crowned every season and no deciding game is played.\nOriginally, two points were given to match winners except in the &lt;a href=\"1989%E2%80%9390%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1989\u201390&lt;/a&gt; season. Starting in &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1995\u201396&lt;/a&gt;, the rule was changed and three points were given for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1999\u20132000&lt;/a&gt; season introduced the &lt;a href=\"promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;promotion and relegation&lt;/a&gt; system for the first time, where the two clubs placed 1st and 2nd within the four teams with the lowest average, had to play a two-leg series with teams from &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;Primera B Nacional&lt;/a&gt; to keep their place in the division.\nInicial and Final (2012\u20132014).\nFor the 2012\u201313 season, the Torneo Apertura and Clausura became \"Torneo Inicial\" and \"Torneo Final,\" being disputed with the same format as before but proclaiming only one champion each season, unlike the last format that had two champions (Apertura and Clausura, respectively).\nBefore those changes, a controversial project for the 2012\u201313 season had been proposed: it consisted in a new tournament that would contain both the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Primera B Nacional teams: the former was not going to have any relegated team in its 2011\u201312 season and include sixteen teams from the latter, Primera B Nacional. The tournament would also include a team from the Primera B Metropolitana and one from the Torneo Argentino A, creating a 38-team league. These changes were strongly opposed by the media and the people, and finally the tournament was called off. However, the project for the new format was successfully picked up starting from the 2015 season.\nSuperfinal (2013\u20132014).\nOnce Inicial and Final tournaments have finished, both winners had to play a match for the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Campeonato\"&gt;Copa Campeonato&lt;/a&gt; (familiarly known as \"Superfinal\"). The &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;AFA&lt;/a&gt; had previously determined that the first edition (played in 2013) would be considered as a Primera Divisi\u00f3n official title (2012\u201313 season), therefore &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20V%C3%A9lez%20Sarsfield\"&gt;V\u00e9lez Sarsfield&lt;/a&gt; awarded its 10th official championship after defeating &lt;a href=\"Newell%27s%20Old%20Boys\"&gt;Newell's&lt;/a&gt;.\nNevertheless, from the 2014 edition it was determined that the \"Superfinal\" would not be considered as a Primera Divisi\u00f3n title but an official cup.\nDue to this the 2015 and 2016 seasons were played as single tournaments with only one champion per season, the Copa Campeonato has not been held since then.\n2014\u201320: One tournament again and Superliga.\nStarting August 2014, the \"Torneo de Transici\u00f3n\" was held, with 20 teams participating (17 from the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20season\"&gt;2013\u201314 season&lt;/a&gt; and 3 promoted from the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;2013\u201314 Primera B Nacional&lt;/a&gt;). No teams were relegated at the end of the championship.\nIn 2015, the format switched to a tournament with 30 teams. The first five clubs of the Zonas A &amp; B of &lt;a href=\"2014%20Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;2014 Primera B Nacional&lt;/a&gt; season promoted to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. Those 10 teams, with the addition of the 20 clubs currently participating in the top division, qualified to contest the next season.\nThat same year, the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;AFA&lt;/a&gt; announced the format for the next five seasons of the Primera Divisi\u00f3n:\n2020\u2013present.\nIn February 2020, President of AFA &lt;a href=\"Claudio%20Tapia\"&gt;Claudio Tapia&lt;/a&gt; stated that the Superliga had been established to position Argentine football as a product, but it failed in that purpose. As a result, AFA would take over the organisation of Primera Divisi\u00f3n championships, according with Tapia's statement. One month after those announcements, the president of the Superliga, Mariano Elizondo, resigned.\nThe Superliga was replaced by a similar body, named \"Liga Profesional de F\u00fatbol\", directly linked to AFA and presided by &lt;a href=\"Marcelo%20Tinelli\"&gt;Marcelo Tinelli&lt;/a&gt;. It was expected that Superliga was dissolved once the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Copa%20de%20la%20Superliga\"&gt;2020 edition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Copa%20de%20la%20Superliga%20Argentina\"&gt;Copa de la Superliga Argentina&lt;/a&gt; finished, but due to &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Argentina\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; the cup was cancelled, accelerating times. In May 2020, the LFP was launched by the AFA.\nChampions.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"1891%20in%20Argentine%20football\"&gt;first championship held in 1891&lt;/a&gt;, 28 different clubs have won the Primera Divisi\u00f3n title at least once. The most successful club is &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate\"&gt;River Plate&lt;/a&gt;, with 37 titles. Other successful clubs are &lt;a href=\"Boca%20Juniors\"&gt;Boca Juniors&lt;/a&gt; with 34, &lt;a href=\"Racing%20Club%20de%20Avellaneda\"&gt;Racing&lt;/a&gt; with 18, &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Independiente\"&gt;Independiente&lt;/a&gt; with 16, and &lt;a href=\"San%20Lorenzo%20de%20Almagro\"&gt;San Lorenzo&lt;/a&gt; with 15.\nTop scorers.\nThe all-time top scorer of Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina is &lt;a href=\"Paraguay\"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;a href=\"forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arsenio%20Erico\"&gt;Arsenio Erico&lt;/a&gt; with 295 goals. Most players on the all-time top scorers table had their golden age before the 1970s, with all of the top five all-time scorers having retired before 1973. The only player retired after that year in the top twenty list is &lt;a href=\"Mart%C3%ADn%20Palermo\"&gt;Mart\u00edn Palermo&lt;/a&gt;, who played for &lt;a href=\"Estudiantes%20de%20La%20Plata\"&gt;Estudiantes (LP)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boca%20Juniors\"&gt;Boca Juniors&lt;/a&gt; in Primera Divisi\u00f3n.\nTeams with most seasons.\nThe following list shows the number of seasons in the First Division only of the first 10 teams.\n\"\u2022Updated 16 July 2021.\"\nMedia coverage.\nIn Argentina, matches are broadcast by &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; companies &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Sports\"&gt;Fox Sports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turner%20Broadcasting%20System\"&gt;Turner&lt;/a&gt;, which signed a contract for 5 years where both companies agreed to pay &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Peso\"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt; 3,200 million per year. Local company &lt;a href=\"Torneos%20y%20Competencias\"&gt;Torneos&lt;/a&gt;, who was formerly the official broadcaster of the Argentine championship from 1985 until 2009, will take over the content production of the games for Fox and La Corte will handle content production for Turner while &lt;a href=\"Cablevisi%C3%B3n%20%28Argentina%29\"&gt;Cablevisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"DirecTV\"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt; and Telecentro will be the TV operators.\nUntil the agreement with Fox and Turner was signed, Argentine football matches were broadcast nationally by &lt;a href=\"El%20Trece\"&gt;El Trece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Telefe\"&gt;Telefe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"America%20TV\"&gt;America TV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"TV%20P%C3%BAblica%20Digital%20%28Argentina%29\"&gt;Channel 7&lt;/a&gt;.
