    "text": "The 1964 United States Elections were held on November 3, and elected the members of the &lt;a href=\"89th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;89th United States Congress&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"1964%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;45th Presidential Election&lt;/a&gt;. The Democratic party retained the presidency and added to their majorities in both chambers of Congress. This was the first presidential election after the ratification of the &lt;a href=\"Twenty-third%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;23rd Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, which granted electoral votes to &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; incumbent President &lt;a href=\"Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson\"&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson&lt;/a&gt; (who took office on November 22, 1963, upon the &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of his predecessor, &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;) won a full term, defeating &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Goldwater\"&gt;Barry Goldwater&lt;/a&gt; from Arizona. Johnson won every state except for &lt;a href=\"Arizona\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20South\"&gt;Deep South&lt;/a&gt;. Johnson won 61% of the popular vote, the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20presidential%20elections%20by%20popular%20vote%20margin\"&gt;largest share&lt;/a&gt; of the popular vote since 1820. Goldwater won the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%201964\"&gt;Republican nomination&lt;/a&gt; on the first ballot, defeating Governor &lt;a href=\"William%20Scranton\"&gt;William Scranton&lt;/a&gt; of Pennsylvania and Governor &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20Rockefeller\"&gt;Nelson Rockefeller&lt;/a&gt; of New York.\nThe Democratic Party picked up 37 seats in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; and 2 seats in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;, thereby capturing &lt;a href=\"veto\"&gt;veto&lt;/a&gt;-proof supermajorities in both chambers.\nIn the gubernatorial elections, the Republican Party won a net gain of one seat."
