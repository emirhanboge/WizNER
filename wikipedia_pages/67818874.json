She was known colloquially as \"Weary Willy\".\nConstruction &amp; Operations.\n\"Waialeale\" was built in 1884 by the Hall Brothers at &lt;a href=\"Port%20Blakely%2C%20Bainbridge%20Island%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Port Blakely&lt;/a&gt;. In 1905 the vessel was brought to &lt;a href=\"Puget%20Sound\"&gt;Puget Sound&lt;/a&gt; by Cary Cook of Cook &amp; Company and operated as a propeller steamer on the &lt;a href=\"Tacoma\"&gt;Tacoma&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Vancouver%20B.C.\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; run, replacing the \"&lt;a href=\"Mainlander%20%28steamboat%29\"&gt;Mainlander&lt;/a&gt;\".
