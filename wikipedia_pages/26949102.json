    "text": "The Segal Centre for Performing Arts, formerly the Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts, is a &lt;a href=\"theatre\"&gt;theatre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. It is located at 5170 chemin de la C\u00f4te-Sainte-Catherine, in the borough of &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B4te-des-Neiges%E2%80%93Notre-Dame-de-Gr%C3%A2ce\"&gt;C\u00f4te-des-Neiges\u2013Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe building houses the Segal Theatre, the Academy of Performing Arts, CinemaSpace, Studio, and the &lt;a href=\"Dora%20Wasserman%20Yiddish%20Theatre\"&gt;Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Saidye Bronfman Centre.\nIn 1967, the children of Saidye Bronfman gave the theatre to the local community in recognition of their mother's long association with and patronage of the arts. The building that houses the theatre was designed in 1967 by Montreal architect &lt;a href=\"Phyllis%20Lambert\"&gt;Phyllis Lambert&lt;/a&gt;, a daughter of &lt;a href=\"Saidye%20Rosner%20Bronfman\"&gt;Saidye Bronfman&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Segal Centre for Performing Arts.\nFollowing the winding-down of the Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Foundation, in 2007 the Saidye Bronfman Centre was renamed the Segal Centre for Performing Arts in acknowledgement of the financial support of Leanor and &lt;a href=\"Alvin%20Segal\"&gt;Alvin Segal&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with the Bronfman family. Uniting theatre, music, dance, cinema and arts education under one roof, its mission is to promote the creation, production and presentation of professional artistic work, support emerging artists and foster intercultural understanding through the arts.\nThe Segal Theatre is now an English-language theatre. It has expanded to become a nationally recognized venue for the performing arts with a focus on creation, innovation, diversity, and cross-cultural collaborations. Driven by a belief in the power of the arts to strengthen and connect communities, the Segal's programming emphasizes original interpretations of popular classics and contemporary works, new Canadian musicals, and engaging productions with universal appeal.\nIn 2008, the Segal Theatre co-produced the original musical \"Houdini\" with the Montreal Highlights Festival (dir. &lt;a href=\"Bryna%20Wasserman\"&gt;Bryna Wasserman&lt;/a&gt;). It was remounted later that year by the Montreal International Jazz Festival, the first play ever to be featured at the Festival. It was wildly successful with both French and English audiences as well as critics.\nOther highlights include Sam Shepard\u2019s \"Buried Child\" (2009) which was co-produced with theNational Arts Centre (NAC) and directed byPeter Hinton, Artistic Director of English Theatre at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Arts%20Centre\"&gt;NAC&lt;/a&gt;. \"Old Wicked Songs\" (2010, dir. Bryna Wasserman) by Jon Marans was co-produced with &lt;a href=\"Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20du%20Rideau%20Vert\"&gt;Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Rideau Vert&lt;/a&gt; and played in French as \"Une musique inqui\u00e9tante\" before the original cast and crew moved to the Segal to perform the production in English.\nThe Segal Centre has become a major player in the development and production of new Canadian musicals. In June 2015, the Centre premiered \"Belles Soeurs: The Musical\" based on the play by Michel Tremblay with book and lyrics by Ren\u00e9 Richard Cyr, music by Daniel B\u00e9langer, English adaptation of book and lyrics by Neil Bartram and Brian Hill, and directed by Ren\u00e9 Richard Cyr. A co-production with Copa de Oro, \"Belles Soeurs\" went on a national tour and won the Capital Critics Circle Award for Best Production after its stop at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa.\nIn June, 2015, the Segal Centre launched a world premiere of a musical adaptation of &lt;a href=\"Mordecai%20Richler\"&gt;Mordecai Richler&lt;/a&gt;'s novel, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Apprenticeship%20of%20Duddy%20Kravitz%20%28novel%29\"&gt;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&lt;/a&gt;\", starring Alberta-born Kenneth James Stewart as the infamous Duddy, who follows his grandfather's advice to own some land, regardless of the personal consequences.\nIn October 2016, the Segal Centre premiered \"Prom Queen: The Musical\" based on the true story of Marc Hall, the Ontario teenager who took his Catholic School Board to court when it refused to let him attend prom with his boyfriend. Produced by Marcia Kash with book by Kent Staines, lyrics by Akiva Romer-Segal, music by Colleen Dauncey, musical direction by Mark Camilleri, choreography by Sean Cheesman, \"Prom Queen: The Musical\" won the &lt;a href=\"Playwrights%20Guild%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Playwrights Guild of Canada&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s Stage West Pechet Family Musical Award at the Tom Hendry Awards in 2016.\nThe Segal Centre is also an artistic resource and hub for Montreal\u2019s diverse theatre community of independent and emerging artists to create explore and grow. Its second stage, The Studio, has been a venue for SideMart Theatrical Grocery; the Power Jazz series; and the Segal\u2019s popular Broadway Caf\u00e9 events, as well as guest programming.\nIn addition, the Segal Centre for Performing Arts houses the Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre, celebrating almost sixty years of dramatizing the Jewish experience.\nThe current Artistic Director is &lt;a href=\"Lisa%20Rubin\"&gt;Lisa Rubin&lt;/a&gt;, who took up the position in 2014.\nMandate.\nThe Segal Centre for Performing Arts is a not-for-profit theatre company dedicated to nurturing, producing and presenting world-class English-language theatre, and to showcasing professional artists from Montreal and around the world.\nFounded in 1967, the Segal Centre has expanded to become a nationally recognized venue for the performing arts, a training ground for emerging artists and a one-of-a-kind destination for the best of jazz concerts, dance, cinema and Jewish arts and culture.\nAwards.\nMETA Awards\nOutstanding Set Design - Eo Sharp, \"RED\"\nOutstanding Production - \"Sherlock Holmes\"\nOutstanding Direction - Andrew Shaver, \"Sherlock Holmes\"\nOutstanding Costume Design - James Lavoie, \"Sherlock Holmes\"\nOutstanding Lighting Design - Luc Prairie, \"Sherlock Holmes\"\nOutstanding Sound Design - Jesse Ash, \"Sherlock Holmes\"\nOutstanding Supporting Performance - Julie Tamiko Manning, \"Othello\"\nOutstanding Supporting Performance - Daniel Brochu, \"Othello\"\nOutstanding Direction - Micheline Chevrier, \"Top Girls\"\nOutstanding Lead Performance - Leni Parker, \"Top Girls\"\nOutstanding Set Design - Max-Otto Fauteux, \"Top Girls\"\nOutstanding Costume Design - Myl\u00e8ne Chabrol, \"Top Girls\"\nOutstanding Lighting Design - Martin Sirois, \"Top Girls\"\nOutstanding Emerging Artist - Aiza Ntibarikure, \"Ain\u2019t Misbehavin\u2019\"\nOutstanding Set Design - Michael Gianfrancesco, \"Funny Girl\"\nOutstanding Costume Design - Michael Gianfrancesco, \"Funny Girl\"\nOutstanding PACT Production, \"Travesties\"\nOutstanding Set Design - Pierre-\u00c9tienne Locas, \"Travesties\"\nOutstanding Costume Design - Louise Bourret, \"Travesties\"\nOutstanding Lighting Design - Kimberly Purtell, \"We Are Not Alone\" (Crow\u2019s Theatre)\nOutstanding Original Composition - Matthew Barber and Justin Rutledge, \"The Graduate\"\nOutstanding Community Production, \"The Producers\"\nCapital Critics Circle Award (Ottawa)\nBest Professional Play (2016), \"Belles Soeurs: The Musical\"\nMasques Awards\nBest English Language Production - \"I Am My Own Wife\"\nBest English Production - \"The Glass Menagerie\"\nBest English Production - \"Salt Water Moon\"\nBest English Production - \"Betrayal\"\nBest Actress(es) - Viola L\u00e9ger and Linda Sorgini in \"Grace and Glorie\"\nLifetime Achievement Award to Dora Wasserman\nAQCT French Critics\nBest English Language Production - \"Amadeus\"\nMECCA Awards\nOutstanding Costume Design - James Lavoie, \"Lies My Father Told Me\"\nOutstanding Direction - Greg Kramer, \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\"\nBest Sound Design, Rob Denton, \"The Satchmo\u2019 Suite\"\nSet Design, Yannik Lariv\u00e9e, \"I Am My Own Wife/Amadeus\"\nBest Actor, Brett Christopher,\" I Am My Own Wife\"\nBest Director, Alexandre Marine, \"Amadeus\"\nBest Professional Production, \"The Importance of Being Earnest\"\nBest Director, Perter Hinton,\" A Doll House\"\nBest Lighting, Spike Lyne, \"My Old Lady\"\nBest Set Design, Peter Hartwell, \"The Importance of Being Earnest\"\nBest Actor - Martha Henry in \"Rose\"\nBest Professional Production - \"Hedda Gabler\"\nBest Actor - Don Anderson in \"De Profundis\" (Gravy Bath)\nBest Semi Pro\\Amateur -\" Kali Yuga\" (Gravy Bath)\nBest Actor - Gareth Armstrong in \"Shylock\"\nBest Actress - Michelle Monteith in \"The Glass Menagerie\"\nBest Director - Madd Harold for \"Shakespeare's Coriolanus\" (Gravy Bath)\nBest Semi Pro\\Amateur - \"Shakespeare's Coriolanus\" (Gravy Bath)\nBest Ensemble - Theatre Smith-Gilmour for \"Chekhov's Shorts\"\nBest Actor - Pierre Brault in\" Blood on the Moon\"\nBest Professional Production - \"Salt Water Moon\"\nBest Actress - Uta Hagen in \"Collected Stories\"\nBest Semi-professional Production - \"The Threepenny Opera \"(Yiddish Theatre)\nBest Production - \"After the Dance\"\nAward of Distinction to Bryna Wasserman\nBest New Ensemble to Montreal Young Company\nBest Semi-Professional Production - \"The Great Houdini\" (Yiddish Theatre)\nBest English Production - Betrayal\n\"The MECCAs are awarded by the Montreal English Critics Circle\"\n\"The Masques are awarded by l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Qu\u00e9becoise du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\""
