    "text": " \nPotchefstroom (, colloquially Potch) is an &lt;a href=\"college%20town\"&gt;academic city&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"North%20West%20%28South%20African%20province%29\"&gt;North West Province of South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It hosts the &lt;a href=\"Potchefstroom%20Campus\"&gt;Potchefstroom Campus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"North-West%20University\"&gt;North-West University&lt;/a&gt;. Potchefstroom is on the &lt;a href=\"Mooi%20River%20%28Vaal%29\"&gt;Mooi Rivier&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Afrikaans\"&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/a&gt; for \"pretty river\"), roughly west-southwest of &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg\"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; and east-northeast of &lt;a href=\"Klerksdorp\"&gt;Klerksdorp&lt;/a&gt;. Potchefstroom, together with &lt;a href=\"Rustenburg\"&gt;Rustenburg&lt;/a&gt;, is the second-largest city in the North West Province. The largest city, Klerksdorp, is about away.\nEtymology.\nSeveral theories exist about the origin of the city's name. According to one theory, it originates from \"Potgieter\" + \"Chef\" + \"stroom\" (referring to &lt;a href=\"Voortrekker\"&gt;Voortrekker&lt;/a&gt; leader and town founder &lt;a href=\"Andries%20Potgieter\"&gt;Andries Potgieter&lt;/a&gt;; \"chef\" indicates the leader of the Voortrekkers, and \"stroom\" refers to the &lt;a href=\"Mooi%20River%20%28Vaal%29\"&gt;Mooi River&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20Jenkins\"&gt;Geoffrey Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; writes, \"Others however, attribute the name as having come from the word 'Potscherf', meaning a shard of a broken pot, due to the cracks that appear in the soil of the Mooi River Valley during drought resembling a broken pot\". M. L. Fick suggests that Potchefstroom developed from the abbreviation of \"Potgieterstroom\" to \"Potgerstroom\", which became \"Potchefstroom\". However, this does not account for the appearance of \"Potjestroom\" on many documents and photographs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"African%20National%20Congress\"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; decided to change the name of the municipality and some street names in 2006, favouring \"Tlokwe\" as the new name. In 2007, its name was changed from Potchefstroom Municipality to &lt;a href=\"Tlokwe%20Municipality\"&gt;Tlokwe Municipality&lt;/a&gt;. However, the city continued to use the name Potchefstroom. The Tlowke Municipality merged with the &lt;a href=\"Ventersdorp%20Municipality\"&gt;Ventersdorp Municipality&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, forming the larger &lt;a href=\"JB%20Marks%20Local%20Municipality\"&gt;JB Marks Local Municipality&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPotchefstroom, founded in 1838 by the &lt;a href=\"Voortrekkers\"&gt;Voortrekkers&lt;/a&gt;, is the second-oldest European settlement in the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Republic\"&gt;Transvaal&lt;/a&gt;. The oldest European settlement is &lt;a href=\"Klerksdorp\"&gt;Klerksdorp&lt;/a&gt;, about west. Some historians challenge this, because the first settlement was in the \"upper regions of the Schoon Spruit\" (believed to have been between Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom). However, Potchefstroom was the first to develop into a town.\nUntil 1840, the towns of Potchefstroom and &lt;a href=\"Winburg\"&gt;Winburg&lt;/a&gt; and their surrounding territories were a &lt;a href=\"Boer%20Republic\"&gt;Boer Republic&lt;/a&gt; known as the Republic of Winburg-Potchefstroom. Voortrekker leader &lt;a href=\"Andries%20Hendrik%20Potgieter\"&gt;Andries Hendrik Potgieter&lt;/a&gt; was elected as chief commandant. In October 1840, after a meeting between Potgieter, &lt;a href=\"Andries%20Pretorius\"&gt;Andries Pretorius&lt;/a&gt; and G. R. van Rooyen, it was decided that Potchefstroom would unite with \"Pieter Mouriets Burg\" (&lt;a href=\"Pietermaritzburg\"&gt;Pietermaritzburg&lt;/a&gt;).\nOn 16\u201317 January 1852, the &lt;a href=\"Sand%20River%20Convention\"&gt;Sand River Convention&lt;/a&gt; was signed between &lt;a href=\"Andries%20Pretorius\"&gt;Andries Pretorius&lt;/a&gt; (representing the Boers) and Major W. S. Hogge and C. M. Owen (representing Britain). According to the convention, the British government would allow the immigrant farmers north of the &lt;a href=\"Vaal%20River\"&gt;Vaal River&lt;/a&gt; to govern themselves with no interference from either side. This signalled the establishment of the \"Zuid-Afrikaanse Republiek\" (ZAR) (&lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Republic\"&gt;South African Republic&lt;/a&gt;). In Article 17 of the Constitution of the ZAR dated 18 February 1858 (which was accepted in Rustenburg), it was stated that \"Potchefstroom, located on the Mooi River, would be the capital of the Republic and that Pretoria would be the seat of government\". In May 1860, Potchefstroom became the \"chief city\" of the republic and the capital moved to &lt;a href=\"Pretoria\"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 16 December 1880, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Boer%20War\"&gt;First Boer War&lt;/a&gt; began when the Boers laid siege to the old fort. The siege ended amicably on 23 March 1881. The British built &lt;a href=\"British%20concentration%20camps\"&gt;concentration camps&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Second Boer War&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Boer\"&gt;Boer&lt;/a&gt; women, children, and elderly men, where more than 27,000 died of starvation and disease.\nAt the opening of the city hall in 1909, colonial secretary &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Smuts\"&gt;Jan Smuts&lt;/a&gt; was asked about the possibility of Potchefstroom becoming capital of the Union. He replied that the city stood no chance, but should aim to be South Africa's largest educational centre.\nThis has led to Potchefstroom's being the \"city of expertise\", with numerous tertiary educational institutions. It has hosted the annual late-September &lt;a href=\"Aardklop\"&gt;Aardklop&lt;/a&gt; Arts Festival, a predominantly-Afrikaans arts festival, since 1997.\nPopulation.\nThe Potchefstroom Municipality, which encompasses several neighbouring settlements, had a population of 128,357 in the 2007 community survey. Of these, 69.6 percent were white, 27.0 percent were black, three percent were &lt;a href=\"coloureds\"&gt;coloureds&lt;/a&gt; and 0.4 percent were Asian. However, the city itself and surrounding suburbs have a population of 43,448, of which 69.9 percent are white, 25.4 percent are black, 2.8 percent were coloured and 1.3 percent were Asian.\n&lt;a href=\"Ken%20McArthur\"&gt;Ken McArthur&lt;/a&gt; of Potchefstroom won a gold medal at the &lt;a href=\"1912%20Stockholm%20Olympics\"&gt;1912 Stockholm Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"marathon\"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;. McArthur was known in his home village of North Antrim for his training routine, which consisted of racing a narrow-gauge train.\nEducation.\nPotchefstroom is home to five tertiary institutions, 30 other schools and a number of research bureaus and training centres, including:\nPublic primary and high schools in Potchefstroom's townships include Boitirelo Primary School, Lesego Primary School, Boitshoko High School and Tlokwe High School.\nSports facilities.\nPotchefstroom, known as the North West Province's \"Home of Sport\", is the provincial headquarters of 17 major sports. The city council emphasises the establishment, maintenance and upgrading of its sports facilities, particularly to meet the sporting and recreational needs of its youth. The &lt;a href=\"Mooi%20River%20%28Vaal%29\"&gt;Mooi River&lt;/a&gt; and other trails add colour and variety to facilities available to residents and tourists.\nPotchefstroom has hosted two World Cup-winning teams (in &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;), and is a home away from home for international athletes and teams. At altitude, it provides a good balance between altitude and quality training. The city has no large factories, and good air quality. Athletes and professional teams train at the North-West University's High Performance Institute of Sport.\nCricket is popular, with &lt;a href=\"Senwes%20Park\"&gt;Senwes Park&lt;/a&gt; the home ground of the &lt;a href=\"Highveld%20Lions\"&gt;Highveld Lions&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2003 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Potchefstroom hosted matches between &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, Australia and &lt;a href=\"Namibia%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;, and South Africa and &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. Potchefstroom co-hosted the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Cricket%20World%20Cup%20Qualifier\"&gt;2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;South Africa national cricket team&lt;/a&gt; has regularly chosen Potchefstroom for off-season training and has hosted the Australian team's off-season cricket camps. During the 2003 Cricket World Cup, &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Australia's cricket team&lt;/a&gt; chose Potchefstroom as their home base and won the tournament.\n&lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union\"&gt;Rugby&lt;/a&gt; is arguably Potchefstroom's most popular sport. &lt;a href=\"Ol%C3%ABn%20Park\"&gt;Ol\u00ebn Park&lt;/a&gt;, the main rugby stadium, is primarily used for rugby union matches by the &lt;a href=\"Leopards%20%28rugby%20team%29\"&gt;Leopards&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vodacom%20Cup\"&gt;Vodacom Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the first division of the &lt;a href=\"Currie%20Cup\"&gt;Currie Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium is also used for football matches, and has hosted the &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa%20national%20under-23%20football%20team\"&gt;South Africa under-23 team&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jomo%20Cosmos%20F.C.\"&gt;Jomo Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Premier%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;Premier Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;, team relegated to the &lt;a href=\"National%20First%20Division\"&gt;National First Division&lt;/a&gt;, also uses the stadium for some matches. Profert Ol\u00ebn Park was named after &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Ludwig%20Theodor%20Ol%C3%ABn\"&gt;Carl Ludwig Theodor Ol\u00ebn&lt;/a&gt;, president of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Transvaal%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Western Transvaal Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; between 1922 and 1934. &lt;a href=\"Profert\"&gt;Profert&lt;/a&gt;, a local fertiliser company, maintains the playing field.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Absa%20Puk%20Oval\"&gt;Absa Puk Oval&lt;/a&gt; is on the North-West University campus. The university sport grounds is known as the Fanie du Toit Sports Complex. The main rugby field has hosted several Leopards games and the &lt;a href=\"Potchefstroom%20Campus\"&gt;Potchefstroom Campus&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20Rugby%23Varsity%20Cup\"&gt;Varsity Cup&lt;/a&gt; matches.\nPUC McArthur Stadium, the athletics stadium, was renovated for the fourth time in 2014. Built in 1892, it was named in honour of &lt;a href=\"1912%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1912 Olympic marathon&lt;/a&gt; gold medalist &lt;a href=\"Ken%20McArthur\"&gt;Ken McArthur&lt;/a&gt;. Noted local athletes include &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%20Khotso%20Mokoena\"&gt;Godfrey Khotso Mokoena&lt;/a&gt;, the silver medalist in the long jump at the 2008 Beijing &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Summer Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hezeki%C3%A9l%20Sepeng\"&gt;Hezeki\u00e9l Sepeng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jorrie%20Muller\"&gt;Jorrie Muller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Justine%20Robbeson\"&gt;Justine Robbeson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Diedericks\"&gt;Ryan Diedericks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe visit of the &lt;a href=\"Spain%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Spain national football team&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; brought a new level of sport to Potchefstroom and the NWU. Spain, who won their inaugural &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; title, chose Potchefstroom as their base camp. A new sports complex was built at the North-West University for the team, and the local airport was expanded to accommodate large passenger planes.\nPolitics.\nMayor Maphetle Maphetle of the &lt;a href=\"African%20National%20Congress\"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; was dismissed in late 2012 after a motion of no confidence passed, and Annette Combrink of the opposition &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Alliance%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Democratic Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was elected mayor. Three months later a motion of no confidence removed Combrink, and Maphetle was reinstated. Since then, municipal-council and mayoral elections have been keenly contested.\nAttractions.\nListed monuments.\nSince the Heritage Resources Act of 1999, monuments are classified as grade I (national), II (provincial) and III (local). Many national monuments were downgraded to grade II.\nProvisional grade-III sites.\nAlthough Potchefstroom has no local heritage sites, the following sites have been placed on the municipality's provisional list:\nEconomy.\nPotchefstroom is an industrial, service and agricultural growth point of North West province. Industries include steel, food, and chemical processing. The chicken industry is important, and companies around the city include Chubby Chick, Serfontein Poultry, Haagner's Poultry, Crown Chicken and Highveld Egg Cooperative.\nNorth-Western Command.\nThe city plays an important role with the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20National%20Defence%20Force\"&gt;South African National Defence Force&lt;/a&gt;, hosting the provincial command headquarters. Potchefstroom regularly holds military displays and parades. The city had an airfield used by the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Air%20Force\"&gt;South African Air Force&lt;/a&gt; which was closed in budget cuts after the end of apartheid."
