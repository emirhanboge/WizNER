    "text": "Jaggery is a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20unrefined%20sweeteners\"&gt;traditional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"non-centrifugal%20cane%20sugar\"&gt;non-centrifugal cane sugar&lt;/a&gt; consumed in the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is a concentrated product of &lt;a href=\"cane%20juice\"&gt;cane juice&lt;/a&gt; and often &lt;a href=\"Date%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;date&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Arecaceae\"&gt;palm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"plant%20sap\"&gt;sap&lt;/a&gt; without separation of the &lt;a href=\"molasses\"&gt;molasses&lt;/a&gt; and crystals, and can vary from golden brown to dark brown in colour. It is similar to the Latin American &lt;a href=\"panela\"&gt;panela&lt;/a&gt;, also known as piloncillo in Mexico. It contains up to 50% &lt;a href=\"sucrose\"&gt;sucrose&lt;/a&gt;, up to 20% &lt;a href=\"invert%20sugar\"&gt;invert sugar&lt;/a&gt;s, and up to 20% moisture, with the remainder made up of other insoluble matter, such as &lt;a href=\"wood%20ash\"&gt;wood ash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"protein\"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"bagasse\"&gt;bagasse&lt;/a&gt; fibres. Jaggery is very similar to &lt;a href=\"muscovado\"&gt;muscovado&lt;/a&gt;, an important sweetener in &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20cuisine\"&gt;Portuguese cuisine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"British%20cuisine\"&gt;British cuisine&lt;/a&gt;. The Kenyan Sukari ngutu/nguru has no fibre; it is dark and is made from sugar cane and also sometimes extracted from palm tree.\nEtymology.\nJaggery comes from Indo-Portuguese , , from &lt;a href=\"Malayalam\"&gt;Malayalam&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Kannada\"&gt;Kannada&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt; (), or &lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt; (), ultimately from &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; (). It is a &lt;a href=\"wikt%3AAppendix%3AGlossary%23doublet\"&gt;doublet&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Asugar%23English\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins and production.\nJaggery is made of the products of &lt;a href=\"sugarcane\"&gt;sugarcane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"toddy%20palm\"&gt;toddy palm&lt;/a&gt; tree. The sugar made from the sap of the date palm is more prized and less commonly available outside of the regions where it is made. The toddy palm is tapped for producing jaggery in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. \nIn Sri Lanka, syrup extracts from \"kithul\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Caryota%20urens\"&gt;Caryota urens&lt;/a&gt;\") trees are widely used for jaggery production.\nAll types of the sugar come in blocks or pastes of solidified concentrated sugar syrup heated to . Traditionally, the syrup is made by boiling raw sugarcane juice or palm sap in large, shallow, round-bottomed vessels.\nPreparation.\nHistorically, the sugarcane cultivators used crushers that were powered by oxen, but all modern crushers are power-driven. These crushers are placed in fields near the sugarcane plants. The cut and cleaned sugarcane is crushed and the extracted cane juice is collected in a large vessel. A quantity of the juice is transferred to a smaller vessel for heating on a furnace.\nThe vessel is heated for about an hour. Dried wood pulp from the crushed sugarcane is traditionally used as fuel for the furnace. While boiling the juice, &lt;a href=\"Calcium%20hydroxide\"&gt;lime&lt;/a&gt; is added to it so that all the wood particles rise to the top of the juice in a froth, which is skimmed off. Finally, the juice is thickened. The resulting thick liquid is about one-third of the original volume.\nThis hot liquid is golden. It is stirred continuously and lifted with a spatula to observe whether it forms a thread or drips while falling. If it forms many threads, it has completely thickened. It is poured into a shallow flat-bottomed pan to cool and solidify. The pan is extremely large to allow only a thin coat of this hot liquid to form at its bottom, so as to increase the surface area for quick evaporation and cooling. After cooling, the jaggery becomes a soft solid that is molded into the desired shape.\nThe quality of jaggery is judged by its colour; brown means it is higher in impurities and golden-yellow implies it is relatively pure. Due to this grading scale, coloured adulterants are sometimes added to jaggery to simulate the golden hue.\nUses.\nSouth Asia (Indian subcontinent).\nJaggery is used as an ingredient in sweet and savoury dishes in the cuisines of &lt;a href=\"Indian%20cuisine\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pakistani%20cuisine\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bangladeshi%20cuisine\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, Nepal, Sri Lanka, &lt;a href=\"Afghan%20cuisine\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20cuisine\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. For example, a pinch of it is sometimes added to \"&lt;a href=\"Sambar%20%28dish%29\"&gt;sambar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rasam%20%28dish%29\"&gt;rasam&lt;/a&gt;\" and other staples in &lt;a href=\"Udupi%20cuisine\"&gt;Udupi cuisine&lt;/a&gt;. Jaggery is added to lentil soups (\"&lt;a href=\"dal\"&gt;d\u0101l&lt;/a&gt;\") to add sweetness to balance the spicy, salty, and sour components, particularly in &lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20cuisine\"&gt;Gujarati cuisine&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, jaggery is usually made using the syrup of the &lt;a href=\"Caryota%20urens\"&gt;kithul&lt;/a&gt; palm tree, or from &lt;a href=\"coconut\"&gt;coconut&lt;/a&gt; syrup. The respective names in Sinhalese are \"kitul hakuru\" (\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca \u0dc4\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4) and \"pol hakuru\" (\u0db4\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0dca \u0dc4\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4). Jaggery from the syrup of the &lt;a href=\"Palmyrah\"&gt;Palmyrah&lt;/a&gt; palm is more prominent in the northern part of the country; this is referred to as palmyrah jaggery or \"thal hakuru\" (\u0dad\u0dbd\u0dca \u0dc4\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4). Jaggery made from sugarcane syrup is considered inferior to these types of palm syrup based jaggery varieties, and the term jaggery (\u0dc4\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4) is generally understood in the country to refer to palm syrup based jaggery rather than sugarcane jaggery.\n&lt;a href=\"Maharashtra\"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt; in India is the largest producer and consumer of jaggery known as \"gul\" (\u0917\u0941\u0933) in &lt;a href=\"Marathi%20language\"&gt;Marathi&lt;/a&gt;, \"gur\" (\u06af\u0691) in &lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt;, \"bella\u1e41\" (\u0c2c\u0c46\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c02) in Telugu, bella (\u0cac\u0cc6\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2) in Kannada, \u201cVellam\u201d(\u0bb5\u0bc6\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bae\u0bcd) in Tamil, \"sharkara\" (\u0d36\u0d30\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d30) in Malayalam, \" gu\u1e5ba\" (\u0997\u09c1\u09a1\u09bc) in Bengali, \"G\u014d\u1e37a\" (\u0a97\u0acb\u0ab3) in Gujarati, \"mi\u1e63\u1e6da\" (\u092e\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f) in Sanskrit, \"gur\" (\u0917\u0941\u0921\u093c) in &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Kolhapur\"&gt;Kolhapur&lt;/a&gt; is one of the largest producers of jaggery in India and has a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Geographical%20Indications%20in%20India\"&gt;GI Tag&lt;/a&gt; for Jaggery. Most vegetable dishes, &lt;a href=\"curry\"&gt;curries&lt;/a&gt;, and \"dals\", and many desserts contain it. Jaggery is especially used during &lt;a href=\"Makar%20Sankranti\"&gt;Makar Sankranti&lt;/a&gt; for making a dessert called \"&lt;a href=\"tilgul\"&gt;tilgul&lt;/a&gt;\". In &lt;a href=\"Gujarat\"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt;, a similar preparation known called \"tal na ladu\" or \"tal sankli\" is made. In rural Maharashtra and Karnataka, water and a piece of jaggery are given to a person arriving home from working under a hot sun. In Indian culture during the New Year feast, jaggery-based sweets are made. In Andhra, Telangana and Karnataka on &lt;a href=\"Ugadi\"&gt;Ugadi&lt;/a&gt; festival day (New Year), Ugadi Pachadi is made from jaggery and five other ingredients (shad ruchulu- sweet, sour, salt, tangy, spice and bitter) and is consumed symbolizing life is a mixture of happiness, disgust, fear, surprise, anger and sadness. \n&lt;a href=\"Molasses\"&gt;Molasses&lt;/a&gt; (\u0915\u093e\u0915\u0935\u0940), a byproduct of the production of jaggery, is used in rural Maharashtra and Karnataka as a sweetener. It contains many minerals not found in ordinary sugar and is considered beneficial to health in traditional &lt;a href=\"Ayurveda\"&gt;Ayurvedic&lt;/a&gt; medicine. It is an ingredient of many sweet delicacies, such as \"gur ke chawal / chol\" (\"jaggery rice\"), a traditional Rajasthani or Punjabi dish.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Gujarat\"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"laddu\"&gt;laddu&lt;/a&gt;s\" are made from wheat flour and jaggery. A well-known Maharashtrian recipe, \"&lt;a href=\"puran%20poli\"&gt;puran poli&lt;/a&gt;\", uses it as a sweetener apart from sugar. Jaggery is considered an easily available sweet which is shared on any good occasion. In &lt;a href=\"engagement\"&gt;engagement&lt;/a&gt; ceremonies, small particles of it are mixed with &lt;a href=\"Coriander%23Fruit\"&gt;coriander seeds&lt;/a&gt; (\u0aa7\u0abe\u0aa3\u0abe). Hence, in many Gujarati communities, engagement is commonly known by the &lt;a href=\"metonymy\"&gt;metonym&lt;/a&gt; \"gol-dhana\" (\u0a97\u0acb\u0ab3-\u0aa7\u0abe\u0aa3\u0abe), literally \"jaggery and coriander seeds\".\nJaggery is used extensively in South India to balance the pungency of spicy foods. In &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Pradesh\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, and Tamil Nadu it is used for sweets such as \"chakkara pongal\" and \"milk pongal\" (prepared with rice, milk, jaggery). During Sankranti, \"Ariselu\", an authentic Andhra Pradesh dish, is prepared, and in Tamil Nadu, \"ellurundai\" (sesame balls), Adhirasam and pori vilangu urundai (puffed rice balls) are prepared as offering - called prasadam - to god during puja and festivals such as Diwali, Tamil New Year and Janmashtami. \nA sweet liquid called \"Paanakam\", made of water, jaggery and peppercorns is prepared as the favorite offering to Lord Rama during &lt;a href=\"Rama%20Navami\"&gt;Rama Navami&lt;/a&gt; festival. In &lt;a href=\"Kerala\"&gt;Kerala&lt;/a&gt;, it is considered auspicious and is widely used in cooking. It is a vital ingredient in many varieties of \"&lt;a href=\"payasam\"&gt;payasam&lt;/a&gt;\", a sweet dish.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;, jaggery is used exclusively as a sweetener. It is used in a dish called \"chakkarai pongal\". It is prepared during the festival of Pongal (Thai Pongal), which is held when the harvesting season begins. It is used to make kalhi, to sweeten fruit salads and payasam (sweet milk) that are offered to the gods. Jaggery is used in religious rituals. In rural areas, cane jaggery and palm jaggery are used to sweeten beverages, whereas refined sugar has replaced it in urban areas.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Oriya%20people\"&gt;Odia&lt;/a&gt; cuisine, cakes or \"&lt;a href=\"pi%E1%B9%ADha\"&gt;pi\u1e6dha&lt;/a&gt;s\" contain jaggery. Pithas like Arisa pitha are made out of jaggery called as guda in Odia. Kakara pitha contains coconut filings which are caramelized using jaggery. Guda is also added to rice flakes known as \"chuda\" and eaten for breakfast. Some marmalade made of mango and \"&lt;a href=\"dillenia\"&gt;dillenia&lt;/a&gt;\" contain the ingredient.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20cuisine\"&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt; cuisine, it is commonly used in making sweet dishes, some of which mix jaggery with milk and coconut. Popular sweet dishes such as \"la\u1e0d\u1e0du\"/\"la\u1e5bu\" or \"pa\u1e6dishapta &lt;a href=\"pitha\"&gt;pi\u1e6dha&lt;/a&gt;\" mix it with coconut shreds. Jaggery is molded into novel shapes as a type of candy. The same preparation of sweets have been made in its neighbouring state of Assam. Some of the popular sweet dishes of Assam such as \"til-pitha\" (made of rice powder, sesame and jaggery), other rice-based \"pitha\", and \"payas\" are made of jaggery. In some villages of Assam, people drink salty red tea with a cube of \"gurd\" (jaggery), which is popularly called \"cheleka-chah\" (licking tea).\nTraditional &lt;a href=\"Karnataka\"&gt;Karnataka&lt;/a&gt; sweets, such as \"paayasa, obbattu (holige)\" and \"unday\" use different kinds of jaggery. A pinch is commonly added to \"sambar\" (a.k.a. \"huLi saaru\") and \"rasam\" (a.k.a. \"saaru\"). Karnataka produces sugar and palm-based jaggery.\n&lt;a href=\"Muzaffarnagar\"&gt;Muzaffarnagar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; has the largest jaggery market in the world, followed by &lt;a href=\"Anakapalle\"&gt;Anakapalle&lt;/a&gt; in the Visakhapatnam District in &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Pradesh\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Kolhapur\"&gt;Kolhapur&lt;/a&gt; District in western Maharashtra is famous for its jaggery, which is yellow and much sought-after in Maharashtra and Gujarat. &lt;a href=\"Mandya\"&gt;Mandya&lt;/a&gt; in Karnataka is known for its jaggery production.\nSoutheast Asia.\nIn Myanmar, jaggery, called \"htanyet\" () in &lt;a href=\"Burmese%20language\"&gt;Burmese&lt;/a&gt;, is harvested from &lt;a href=\"Borassus%20flabellifer\"&gt;toddy palm&lt;/a&gt; syrup. In central Myanmar and around &lt;a href=\"Bagan\"&gt;Bagan&lt;/a&gt; (Pagan), toddy syrup is collected solely for making jaggery. The translucent white syrup is boiled until it becomes golden brown and then made into bite-size pieces. It is considered a sweet and is eaten by children and adults alike, usually in the afternoon with a pot of &lt;a href=\"green%20tea\"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt;. It has been referred to locally as Burmese chocolate. Toddy palm jaggery is sometimes mixed with coconut shreds, &lt;a href=\"jujube\"&gt;jujube&lt;/a&gt; puree or &lt;a href=\"sesame\"&gt;sesame&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the area. This type of jaggery is used in &lt;a href=\"Cuisine%20of%20Myanmar\"&gt;Burmese&lt;/a&gt; cooking, usually to add colour and enrich the food.\nOther uses.\nOther uses include jaggery toffees and jaggery cake made with pumpkin preserve, cashew nuts, peanuts and spices. Jaggery may be used in the creation of alcoholic beverages such as &lt;a href=\"palm%20wine\"&gt;palm wine&lt;/a&gt;.\nBesides being a food, jaggery may be used (mixed in an emulsion with buttermilk and mustard oil) to season the inside of &lt;a href=\"tandoor\"&gt;tandoor&lt;/a&gt; ovens.\nJaggery is used in natural dying of fabric. It is also used in &lt;a href=\"hookah\"&gt;hookah&lt;/a&gt;s in rural areas of Pakistan and India."
