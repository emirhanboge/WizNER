    "text": "Kilcunda is a seaside town located south east of &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Phillip%20Island%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Phillip Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wonthaggi%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Wonthaggi&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Dalyston\"&gt;Dalyston&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"South%20Gippsland%20Highway\"&gt;South Gippsland Highway&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Bass%20Highway%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Bass Highway&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Bass%20Coast%20Shire\"&gt;Bass Coast Shire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gippsland\"&gt;Gippsland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Known originally as a &lt;a href=\"Kilcunda%20railway%20station\"&gt;train station&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Wonthaggi\"&gt;Wonthaggi&lt;/a&gt;, it is now the location of a very popular swimming hole at the Bourne Creek &lt;a href=\"Trestle%20bridge\"&gt;Trestle Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=\"Census%20in%20Australia%232016\"&gt;2016 census&lt;/a&gt;, Kilcunda had a population of 396.\nThe name \"Kilcunda\" is believed to be from the &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australians\"&gt;Aboriginal&lt;/a&gt; term for 'an exclamation', and is reported by one authority to mean, 'Oh dear, the sticks!'\nToday.\nTrestle Bridge.\nThe 91 &lt;a href=\"Metre\"&gt;m&lt;/a&gt; long Kilcunda Bridge was built over the Bourne Creek. It is protected by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust\"&gt;National Trust&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=\"trestle%20bridge\"&gt;trestle bridge&lt;/a&gt; was constructed for the Victorian Railways to carry coal from what was then known as the Powlett Coal Fields. It is a particularly significant monument because most of the steam-locomotive fuel that serviced the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Railways\"&gt;Victorian Railways&lt;/a&gt; network, from 1911 until 1978, crossed over this bridge. Since disused, the bridge is now a tourist attraction and a part of the Bass Coast Rail Trail. Bourne creek spills over Kilcunda Beach and out into the &lt;a href=\"sea\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bass%20Strait\"&gt;Bass Strait&lt;/a&gt;. Seashell collecting is permitted on Kilcunda Beaches.\nKilcunda Ocean View Hotel.\nThe Kilcunda Ocean View Hotel is located on the Bass Highway directly opposite Kilcunda Beach.\nBass Coast Rail Trail.\nWalking, &lt;a href=\"cycling\"&gt;cycling&lt;/a&gt; and horse &lt;a href=\"trotting\"&gt;trotting&lt;/a&gt; is the modern use of the old &lt;a href=\"Wonthaggi%20railway%20line\"&gt;Wonthaggi railway line&lt;/a&gt; all year round. The &lt;a href=\"Bass%20Coast%20Rail%20Trail\"&gt;Bass Coast Rail Trail&lt;/a&gt; is very flat and begins near Kilcunda at the roundabout to Phillip Island and ends at the Wonthaggi shopping district. You can also access it all along the way, including at Kilcunda. Victoria's only coastal rail trail, it stretches 16 kilometres from &lt;a href=\"Anderson%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Anderson&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Wonthaggi\"&gt;Wonthaggi&lt;/a&gt;, meandering through &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coastal\"&gt;coastal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bushland\"&gt;bushland&lt;/a&gt;, historic coal mining &lt;a href=\"nature%20reserves\"&gt;nature reserves&lt;/a&gt; and coastline with a clear view of the &lt;a href=\"Wonthaggi%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;Wonthaggi wind turbines&lt;/a&gt; and remnants of coal mine buildings. The trail crosses over the Powlett River and the Bourne Creek &lt;a href=\"trestle%20bridge\"&gt;trestle bridge&lt;/a&gt; at Kilcunda, which has &lt;a href=\"panoramic\"&gt;panoramic&lt;/a&gt; views of the beach. &lt;a href=\"Kangaroos\"&gt;Kangaroos&lt;/a&gt; can often be spotted as well as many bird species. An extension of the trail from Anderson to Woolamai, on Phillip Island, has not yet been made suitable for cyclists. Public toilets are situated at each town along the way. Public toilets in Anderson are situated at the bus interchange which handles connections between the San Remo and Inverloch/Wonthaggi public transport routes. The bus interchange is adjacent to the eastern side of the Anderson roundabout.\nKilcunda Lobster Festival.\nThe Annual Kilcunda Lobster &lt;a href=\"Festival\"&gt;Festival&lt;/a&gt; began in 1984 and is held on &lt;a href=\"Australia%20Day\"&gt;Australia Day&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"weekend\"&gt;weekend&lt;/a&gt;.\nShore Fishing.\nVery popular &lt;a href=\"surf%20fishing\"&gt;surf fishing&lt;/a&gt; area, catching Salmon, Trout and Yellow-eyed Mullet.\nClimate.\nKilcunda's location on the north shore of Bass Strait gives it an oceanic climate, with the moderating effect of the ocean allowing a narrower temperature range throughout the year compared to other regions in Victoria. Average daily maximum temperatures range from 23.5\u00a0\u00b0C in the summer to 13.5 in winter. Frost is rare, occurring on average 6 mornings a year.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bunurong%20people\"&gt;Bunurong&lt;/a&gt; Aboriginal people were custodians of this stretch of coast for thousands of years prior to &lt;a href=\"White%20People\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; settlement. The Boakoolawal &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; lived in the Kilcunda area south of the &lt;a href=\"Bass%20River%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Bass River&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Middens\"&gt;Middens&lt;/a&gt; containing &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shellfish\"&gt;shellfish&lt;/a&gt; mark the location of their &lt;a href=\"campsites\"&gt;campsites&lt;/a&gt; along the coast.\nOriginally a coal mining township, The Western Port Coal Mining Company extracted black coal from 1871. The Post Office opened on 5 August 1879. Evidence of coal mining is scattered across Kilcunda, the most famous (pictured here) is the old Kilcunda Rail Bridge on the eastern side. Commissioned in 1910 and decommissioned in the 1970s, it now forms part of the Bass Coast Rail Trail. Mitchell's Black Coal Mine ruins are on Carew Road.\nEducation.\nThere is a primary school in nearby San Remo, a primary school in nearby Dalyston and Wonthaggi has three &lt;a href=\"primary%20school\"&gt;primary school&lt;/a&gt;s and one &lt;a href=\"secondary%20college\"&gt;secondary college&lt;/a&gt;. There is a private secondary college on nearby Phillip Island. Also Chisholm &lt;a href=\"TAFE\"&gt;TAFE&lt;/a&gt;, Bass Coast &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20School\"&gt;Specialist School&lt;/a&gt;, Bass Coast &lt;a href=\"Adult%20Education%20Centre\"&gt;Adult Education Centre&lt;/a&gt;, University of the Third Age (&lt;a href=\"U3A\"&gt;U3A&lt;/a&gt;) retirees education centre, and Connecting Skills Australia (CSA) specialist developmental school, support and employment services/training.\nPlans are underway for a new tertiary education facility."
