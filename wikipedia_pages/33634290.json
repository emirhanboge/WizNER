Each year the public is able to vote on a shortlist of &lt;a href=\"athlete\"&gt;athlete&lt;/a&gt;s who have been put forward for voting by a panel of experts.\nThe short list for the public to vote on is drawn up on various criteria, including the following:\nChairman of the Hall of Fame panel is &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Campbell\"&gt;Darren Campbell&lt;/a&gt;.
