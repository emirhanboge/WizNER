    "text": "Rouen Normandie Rugby is a French &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; club from &lt;a href=\"Rouen\"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt;, currently playing in the second level of the country's &lt;a href=\"National%20Rugby%20League%20%28France%29\"&gt;professional rugby system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Pro%20D2\"&gt;Pro D2&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe team origins date back to 2009, when a group of rugby fanatics from the Normandy region wanted to build a team in the city of &lt;a href=\"Rouen\"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt;. Named Stade Rouennais, their primary objective of reaching &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale%202\"&gt;F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 2&lt;/a&gt; was achieved in 2013.\nSeeking further progress, Stade Rouennais hired &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Hill%20%28rugby%20union%2C%20born%201961%29\"&gt;Richard Hill&lt;/a&gt;, former captain of the England team and finalist of the 1991 World Cup, as General Manager in 2013. Under his management the club stabilized itself in F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 2 and then gained promotion to &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale%201\"&gt;F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1&lt;/a&gt; in 2014\u201315.\nAfter this meteoric rise Normand entrepreneurs Jean-Louis Louvel and Eric Leroy invested in the club by becoming the presidents. The club was renamed Rouen Normandie Rugby. The goal was to professionalize the club and extend it to all of Normandy. Richard Hill committed to the club until 2023.\nThese changes were beneficial, since for the first time in the history of Normandy rugby, Richard Hill lead Rouen Normandy Rugby to become Champion of France of the highest amateur level in 2016\u201317.\nDuring the 2018\u201319 F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 season Hill led Rouen to victory in the Jean Pratt Trophy, which automatically promoted them to &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Pro%20D2\"&gt;Pro D2&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe team plays in red and black shirts and play their home matches at the 3,000-capacity &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Jean-Mermoz\"&gt;Stade Jean-Mermoz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rouen\"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt;. There are plans to build a new stadium by 2023.\nCurrent squad.\nThe Rouen squad for the &lt;a href=\"2021%E2%80%9322%20Rugby%20Pro%20D2%20season\"&gt;2021\u201322 season&lt;/a&gt; is:"
