    "text": "A glacial flute is a &lt;a href=\"landform\"&gt;landform&lt;/a&gt; created by the movement of a &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt; around a &lt;a href=\"boulder\"&gt;boulder&lt;/a&gt;. They are long ridges on the ground parallel to the movement. Examples can be found in many places including &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs glaciers move along the surface of the earth, rocks are slowly mixed in with the ice. Rocks may reach the bottom of the glacier and begin to scrape along the earth. Eventually boulder sized rocks become lodged in the ground. Once the boulder is in place, the glacier flows around it. As a result, a cavity is formed on the down slope side of the boulder. This cavity is then filled with sediments such as &lt;a href=\"till\"&gt;till&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Outwash%20fan\"&gt;outwash&lt;/a&gt;. Similar cavities can also be formed as the glacier moves over bedrock &lt;a href=\"Outcrop\"&gt;outcrops&lt;/a&gt; or bed irregularities which also may form flutes.\nThese mounds are usually only a couple of metres high but hundreds of metres long. They are named flutes as their long and narrow shape resembles the musical instrument."
