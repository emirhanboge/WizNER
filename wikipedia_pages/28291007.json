    "text": "The 1966\u201367 season was &lt;a href=\"NK%20Dinamo%20Zagreb\"&gt;Dinamo Zagreb&lt;/a&gt;'s 21st season in the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav First League&lt;/a&gt;. It was the second season that the league was played in a 30-round format after it had been expanded from 15 to 16 clubs in the &lt;a href=\"1965%E2%80%9366%20Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;1965\u201366 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nDinamo finished runners-up in the &lt;a href=\"1966%E2%80%9367%20Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt;, with two points behind champions &lt;a href=\"FK%20Sarajevo\"&gt;FK Sarajevo&lt;/a&gt;. They were also knocked out in the 1967\u201368 &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Cup\"&gt;Yugoslav Cup&lt;/a&gt; by the same team, losing 1\u20130 in the Round of 16. However, it proved to be the club's most successful season in history in terms of &lt;a href=\"NK%20Dinamo%20Zagreb%20in%20Europe\"&gt;European competitions&lt;/a&gt;, as they won the &lt;a href=\"1966%E2%80%9367%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup\"&gt;1966\u201367 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup&lt;/a&gt;, beating England's &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1967%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;two-legged final&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20130 on aggregate.\nThis was Dinamo's second final in the competition, having lost the &lt;a href=\"1963%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1963 final&lt;/a&gt; to Spanish side &lt;a href=\"Valencia%20CF\"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt; four years earlier. It was also the first and only European trophy won by a &lt;a href=\"SFR%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslav&lt;/a&gt; club until &lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Belgrade\"&gt;Red Star Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;'s triumph in the &lt;a href=\"1990%E2%80%9391%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1990\u201391 European Cup&lt;/a&gt; 24 years later.\n&lt;a href=\"Slaven%20Zambata\"&gt;Slaven Zambata&lt;/a&gt; was the club's top league scorer with 13 goals in 23 matches, and goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Marijan%20Brn%C4%8Di%C4%87\"&gt;Marijan Brn\u010di\u0107&lt;/a&gt; was the only player who appeared in all 30 league matches for the Blues. In addition, Zambata also scored 6 goals in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which meant he shared second place in the competition's goalscoring table (along with Burnley's &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Lochhead\"&gt;Andy Lochhead&lt;/a&gt; and Eintracht Frankfurt's Oskar Lotz) behind &lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%B3ri%C3%A1n%20Albert%2C%20Sr.\"&gt;Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Albert&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ferencv%C3%A1rosi%20TC\"&gt;Ferencv\u00e1ros&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers.\nSquad.\nThe following is the full list of players who appeared in league matches for Dinamo in the 1966\u201367 season.
