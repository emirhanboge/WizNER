    "text": "Walter Henry Ruether (September 29, 1893 \u2013 May 16, 1970) was an American &lt;a href=\"baseball%20player\"&gt;baseball player&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitched&lt;/a&gt; for five different &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;major league&lt;/a&gt; teams. In his 11-year career, Ruether played for the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Robins\"&gt;Brooklyn Robins&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe appeared in the &lt;a href=\"1919%20World%20Series\"&gt;1919 World Series&lt;/a&gt; with the Reds, in the &lt;a href=\"1925%20World%20Series\"&gt;1925 World Series&lt;/a&gt; with the Senators, and in the &lt;a href=\"1926%20World%20Series\"&gt;1926 World Series&lt;/a&gt; with the Yankees. Ruether was also a member of the &lt;a href=\"Murderers%27%20Row\"&gt;1927 Yankees&lt;/a&gt;. Though that team played in the &lt;a href=\"1927%20World%20Series\"&gt;1927 World Series&lt;/a&gt;, Ruether did not participate in any of the games.\nEarly life.\nRuether attended &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20San%20Francisco\"&gt;St. Ignatius College&lt;/a&gt;. On March 10, 1913, St. Ignatius participated in an &lt;a href=\"exhibition%20game\"&gt;exhibition game&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt;. Ruether, a &lt;a href=\"left-handed\"&gt;left-hander&lt;/a&gt;, pitched in the game for St. Ignatius. In the ninth-inning, White Sox &lt;a href=\"shortstop\"&gt;shortstop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buck%20Weaver\"&gt;Buck Weaver&lt;/a&gt; hit a &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;3-run&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt; off Ruether. This secured the victory for the White Sox, and Ruether lost the contest 4\u20132.\nRuether parlayed his strong outing into a try-out with the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt;. After reporting to &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Hot Springs, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; for the Pirates' training camp, he signed a contract. The contract stated that Ruether could opt out if the Pirates attempted to assign him to a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20league\"&gt;Minor league&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"farm%20team\"&gt;farm team&lt;/a&gt;. The Pirates did just that, and consequently, Ruether left the organization.\nAfter he left the Pirates, Ruether went to play in the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20League\"&gt;Northwest League&lt;/a&gt;. He spent the 1914 season and the 1915 season with the &lt;a href=\"Vancouver%20Beavers\"&gt;Vancouver Beavers&lt;/a&gt;. In 1916, Ruether moved to the &lt;a href=\"Spokane%20Indians\"&gt;Spokane Indians&lt;/a&gt;. That team went on to win the pennant.\nMajor League career.\nIn 1917, Ruether signed with the Chicago Cubs. He made his Major League debut in April of that year. After he had appeared in 10 games for the Cubs, the Cincinnati Reds selected Ruether off waivers on July 17, 1917.\nAfter finishing the 1917 season, Ruether enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; due to the break out of World War I. He reported to &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Lewis%20%28Montana%29\"&gt;Camp Lewis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1919, Ruether rejoined the Reds. He won nineteen games that season and the Reds made the &lt;a href=\"1919%20World%20Series\"&gt;1919 World Series&lt;/a&gt;. Though Cincinnati won the series, it has become infamous for the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sox%20Scandal\"&gt;Black Sox Scandal&lt;/a&gt;.\nRuether spent the 1920 season with the Reds. On December 15 of that year, the Reds traded Ruether to the Brooklyn Robins in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Rube%20Marquard\"&gt;Rube Marquard&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe spent the next four seasons as a pitcher for the Robins. During the 1924 season, Ruether suffered from arm problems. After an apparent dispute with &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Ebbets\"&gt;Charles Ebbets&lt;/a&gt;, the Robins owner, the Washington Senators purchased Ruether from the Robins.\nRuether spent the next year and a half with the Senators before the team traded him to the New York Yankees on August 27, 1926 While with the Senators, Ruether appeared in the &lt;a href=\"1925%20World%20Series\"&gt;1925 World Series&lt;/a&gt;. Although he was a pitcher, Ruether did not pitch in the series. Instead, he was used as a &lt;a href=\"pinch%20hitter\"&gt;pinch hitter&lt;/a&gt; and recorded one &lt;a href=\"at-bat\"&gt;at-bat&lt;/a&gt;. For his career, Ruether was a good hitting pitcher with a .258 &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; and 250 career &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Yankees earned a spot in the &lt;a href=\"1926%20World%20Series\"&gt;1926 World Series&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, and Ruether pitched in game three. The game did not go well for Ruether. The Cardinals won 4\u20130.\nIn 1927, Ruether played for his third consecutive pennant winning team. However, Ruether did not appear in the &lt;a href=\"1927%20World%20Series\"&gt;1927 World Series&lt;/a&gt;. The 1927 season was his last in the Major Leagues.\nRuether recorded 137 &lt;a href=\"win%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;wins&lt;/a&gt; and 95 &lt;a href=\"loss%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;losses&lt;/a&gt;, for a .591 &lt;a href=\"winning%20percentage\"&gt;winning percentage&lt;/a&gt;. Ruether holds the National League record for most innings pitched in a season opening game. On opening day 1923, he pitched 14-innings for the Robins.\nPost major league career.\nRuether left the Yankees after the 1927 championship and then pitched in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League\"&gt;Pacific Coast League&lt;/a&gt; until 1933. In 1934, Ruether retired from active play and joined the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Indians\"&gt;Seattle Indians&lt;/a&gt; as the team &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;. The league voted Ruether the &lt;a href=\"All-star%23Sports\"&gt;All-star&lt;/a&gt; team manager in his first year. Ruether left the league in 1936.\nLater in his life, Ruether served as a &lt;a href=\"Scout%20%28sport%29\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; for the Chicago Cubs and &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt;. He helped discover players such as &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Amalfitano\"&gt;Joey Amalfitano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Bressoud\"&gt;Eddie Bressoud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peanuts%20Lowrey\"&gt;Peanuts Lowrey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20McCormick%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Mike McCormick&lt;/a&gt;.\nRuether died in &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Phoenix, Arizona&lt;/a&gt; at age 76."
