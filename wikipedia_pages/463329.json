    "text": "Toowoomba ( , nicknamed 'The Garden City' and 'T-Bar') is a city in the &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba%20Region\"&gt;Toowoomba Region&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darling%20Downs\"&gt;Darling Downs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, Australia. It is west of Queensland's capital city &lt;a href=\"Brisbane\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; by road. The estimated urban population of Toowoomba as of June 2018 was 136,861, having grown at an average annual rate of 1.02% year-on-year over the preceding five years. Toowoomba is the second-most-populous inland city in the country after the national capital of &lt;a href=\"Canberra\"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; and hence the largest town on the &lt;a href=\"Darling%20Downs\"&gt;Darling Downs&lt;/a&gt;. It is also referred to as the capital of the Darling Downs.\nThe Toowoomba region is the home of two main Aboriginal language groups, the &lt;a href=\"Giabal\"&gt;Giabal&lt;/a&gt; whose lands extend south of the city and &lt;a href=\"Jarowair\"&gt;Jarowair&lt;/a&gt; whose lands extend north of the city.\nThe Jarowair lands include the site of one of Australia's most important &lt;a href=\"Bora%20%28Australian%29\"&gt;sacred Bora ceremonial ground&lt;/a&gt;, the \u2018Gummingurru stone arrangement\u2019 dated to c.4000 BC. The site marked one of the major routes employed by many Aboriginal tribes to the south and southeast to participate in the triennial &lt;a href=\"Araucaria%20bidwillii\"&gt;bunya nut feast&lt;/a&gt;. The feast was Australia's largest Indigenous event, and of cultural and spiritual significance. \nThe region's recorded history began when the English botanist &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Cunningham%20%28botanist%29\"&gt;Allan Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; explored the region in 1827, naming it after &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Darling\"&gt;Ralph Darling&lt;/a&gt;, then Governor of New South Wales. British &lt;a href=\"Cart\"&gt;drays&lt;/a&gt; began arriving from 1840, enticed by the rich pastoral lands and established &lt;a href=\"Drayton%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Drayton&lt;/a&gt; in 1842. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Southern%20Queensland\"&gt;War of Southern Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, the region experienced bloodshed as Indigenous tribes attempted to force drays from encroaching into the Darling Downs, with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20One%20Tree%20Hill\"&gt;Battle of One Tree Hill&lt;/a&gt; being fought near to Toowoomba. \nWilliam Horton founded the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Bull%27s%20Head%20Inn\"&gt;Royal Bull's Head Inn&lt;/a&gt; in 1847, and in 1852 invested in a new hotel in the area known as \u2018The Swamp\u2019, a rivalry between the two settlements had developed in which \u2018The Swamp\u2019, later renamed to Toowoomba, outgrew and absorbed Drayton. The town elected its first mayor in 1861, former convict &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Groom\"&gt;William Henry Groom&lt;/a&gt;, and by 1867 was connected by rail which was the first over the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dividing%20Range\"&gt;Great Dividing Range&lt;/a&gt;. In 1904 Toowoomba was declared a city, and saw the &lt;a href=\"Austral%20Society\"&gt;Austral Society&lt;/a&gt; founded there by the esteemed national poet &lt;a href=\"George%20Essex%20Evans\"&gt;George Essex Evans&lt;/a&gt;. Over the 20th century, Toowoomba expanded from primarily agriculture, to services including advanced education and medical.\nA university and cathedral city, Toowoomba is largely preserved of its Victorian era architecture and gardens of which there are more than 150 public parks including the historic &lt;a href=\"Queens%20Park%2C%20Toowoomba\"&gt;Queens Park&lt;/a&gt;. The city hosts the &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba%20Carnival%20of%20Flowers\"&gt;Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers&lt;/a&gt; each September and national championship events for the sports of &lt;a href=\"mountain%20biking\"&gt;mountain biking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"motocross\"&gt;motocross&lt;/a&gt;. Toowoomba is served by &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba%20Wellcamp%20Airport\"&gt;Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport&lt;/a&gt; and the smaller &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba%20City%20Aerodrome\"&gt;Toowoomba City Aerodrome&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nToowoomba is on the crest of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dividing%20Range\"&gt;Great Dividing Range&lt;/a&gt;, around above sea level. A few streets are on the eastern side of the edge of the range, but most of the city is west of the divide.\nThe city occupies the edge of the range and the low ridges behind it. Two valleys run north from the southern boundary, each arising from springs either side of Middle Ridge near Spring Street at an altitude of around 680 m. These waterways, East Creek and West Creek, flow together just north of the CBD to form Gowrie Creek.\nGowrie Creek drains to the west across the &lt;a href=\"Darling%20Downs\"&gt;Darling Downs&lt;/a&gt; and is a tributary of the &lt;a href=\"Condamine%20River\"&gt;Condamine River&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Murray%E2%80%93Darling%20basin\"&gt;Murray\u2013Darling basin&lt;/a&gt;. The water flowing down Gowrie Creek makes its way some to the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Murray%20River\"&gt;Murray River&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; in South Australia. Rain which falls on the easternmost streets of Toowoomba flows east to &lt;a href=\"Moreton%20Bay\"&gt;Moreton Bay&lt;/a&gt; a distance of around .\nThe rich &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20soil\"&gt;volcanic soil&lt;/a&gt; in the region helps maintain the 150 public parks that are scattered across the city. &lt;a href=\"Jacaranda\"&gt;Jacaranda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cinnamomum%20camphora\"&gt;camphor laurel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Platanus\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; trees line many of the city streets. The city's reputation as 'The Garden City' is highlighted during the Australian Carnival of Flowers festival held in September each year. &lt;a href=\"Deciduous\"&gt;Deciduous&lt;/a&gt; trees from around the world line many of the parks, giving a display of autumn colour.\nSuburbs.\nThe City of Toowoomba includes the following suburbs:\n2 - from former &lt;a href=\"Shire%20of%20Jondaryan\"&gt;Shire of Jondaryan&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nTraditional owners.\n&lt;a href=\"Giabal\"&gt;Giabal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jarowair\"&gt;Jarowair&lt;/a&gt; are recognised as the two main Aboriginal language groups of the Toowoomba with Giabal extending south of the city while Jarowair extends north of the city. The Jarowair (also known as Yarowair, Yarow-wair, Barrunggam, Yarrowair, Yarowwair and Yarrow-weir) language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Toowoomba Regional Council, particularly Toowoomba north to &lt;a href=\"Crows%20Nest%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Crows Nest&lt;/a&gt; and west to &lt;a href=\"Oakey%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Oakey&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis traditional landscape changed dramatically with the settlement of Drayton in the 1840s and the pastoral expansion west. Those &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australians\"&gt;Aboriginal Australians&lt;/a&gt; that survived the frontier conflict of this time were pushed to the fringe of society in camps and later moved to missions such as &lt;a href=\"Deebing%20Creek%20Mission\"&gt;Deebing Creek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durundur%20Mission\"&gt;Durundur&lt;/a&gt; and later Barambah (now &lt;a href=\"Cherbourg%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Cherbourg&lt;/a&gt;). There is evidence that local Aboriginal Australians were working on the properties to the west of Toowoomba in this contact period. Ceremonies such as the &lt;a href=\"Bonye%20Bonye%20festival\"&gt;Bonye Bonye festival&lt;/a&gt; remained active until the late 19th century \u2013 groups from south east and south west Queensland as well as northern &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; gathered at Gummingurru, near &lt;a href=\"Gowrie%20Mountain%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Gowrie&lt;/a&gt; (west of Toowoomba) prior to attending the festival. The Gummingurru site is being restored and remains an important ceremonial place for not only the traditional groups but neighbouring groups.\nEuropean exploration and settlement.\nToowoomba's colonial history traces back to 1816 when English &lt;a href=\"botanist\"&gt;botanist&lt;/a&gt; and explorer &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Cunningham%20%28botanist%29\"&gt;Allan Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Australia from &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and in June 1827 discovered of rich farming and grazing land, which became known as the &lt;a href=\"Darling%20Downs\"&gt;Darling Downs&lt;/a&gt;, bordered on the east by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dividing%20Range\"&gt;Great Dividing Range&lt;/a&gt; and west of the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Moreton%20Bay\"&gt;Moreton Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Thirteen years later when George and &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Leslie\"&gt;Patrick Leslie&lt;/a&gt; established Toolburra Station south-west of Toowoomba the first settlers arrived on the Downs and established a township of bark-slab shops called The Springs which was soon renamed &lt;a href=\"Drayton%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Drayton&lt;/a&gt;. Land for the town was first surveyed in 1849, then again in 1853.\nTowards the end of the 1840s Drayton had grown to the point where it had its own newspaper, general store, trading post and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Bull%27s%20Head%20Inn\"&gt;Royal Bull's Head Inn&lt;/a&gt;, which was built by William Horton and still stands today. Horton is regarded as the true founder of Toowoomba despite not being the first European person to live there. Drovers and wagon masters spread the news of the new settlement at Toowoomba. By 1858 Toowoomba was growing fast. It had a population of 700, three hotels and many stores. Land selling at in 1850 was by then . Governor Bowen granted the wish of locals and a new municipality was proclaimed on 24 November 1860.\nThe first town council election took place on 4 January 1861 and &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Groom\"&gt;William Henry Groom&lt;/a&gt; won. The railway from Ipswich was opened in 1867, bringing with it business development. In 1892, the Under Secretary of Public Land proclaimed Toowoomba and the surrounding areas as a township and in 1904 Toowoomba was declared a city. Pastoralism replaced agriculture and dairying by the 1900s.\nIn July 1902, 80 subdivided allotments of \"The Lilley Estate\" owned by the late Sir Charles Lilley, were advertised to be auctioned by Scholefield &amp; Godsall. A map advertising the auction shows that the estate was bordered by Bridge, Mary and Lindsay Streets and overlooking and adjoining the Royal Agricultural Society's Showgrounds.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rotary%20Club\"&gt;Rotary Club&lt;/a&gt; of Toowoomba was established in 1930.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Toowoomba was the location of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20RAAF%20inland%20aircraft%20fuel%20depots\"&gt;RAAF No.7 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot&lt;/a&gt; (IAFD), completed in 1942 and closed on 29 August 1944. Usually consisting of 4 tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the &lt;a href=\"RAAF\"&gt;RAAF&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"US%20Army%20Air%20Forces\"&gt;US Army Air Forces&lt;/a&gt; at a total cost of \u00a3900,000 ($1,800,000).\nToowoomba was named as &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Tidy%20Town%20Awards\"&gt;Australia's Tidiest Town&lt;/a&gt; in 2008.\nOn 10 January 2011, Toowoomba suffered a catastrophic &lt;a href=\"flash%20flood\"&gt;flash flood&lt;/a&gt;. Unusually heavy rainfall had occurred in the preceding days, causing the city's waterways to become swollen. Around midday, an intense storm moved in from the northeast, completely overwhelming East Creek and West Creek which run through the CBD. fell in one day\nwith rainfall peaking at over one 10-minute interval. &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Queensland%20floods%23Toowoomba%20and%20the%20Lockyer%20Valley\"&gt;The flood&lt;/a&gt; caused damage to properties and infrastructure, and resulted in the deaths of 2 people in Toowoomba.\nClimate.\nToowoomba has a warm &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; (with warm summers and cool winters). Compared to other parts of Queensland, Toowoomba experiences more frequent high winds, hail, frost and fog and is considered cooler than many other towns and cities in Queensland. The city is rather sunny, receiving 107.2 clear days annually.\nDaily maximum temperatures in Toowoomba average in summer and in winter. Unlike most of inland Queensland, summer temperatures above are uncommon, whilst winter days rarely warm above . Winter nights seldom drop below &lt;a href=\"freezing\"&gt;freezing&lt;/a&gt;; however, in a situation unique among Queensland cities, &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; has been reported on the higher parts of the city on several occasions. Light &lt;a href=\"frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; will be experienced several nights each winter in the city centre, more often in the western suburbs.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Bureau%20of%20Meteorology\"&gt;Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/a&gt;, the highest temperature ever recorded in Toowoomba was on 12 February 2017, while the lowest was on 12 July 1965.\nAverage annual rainfall, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, is , which peaks in the warm season. Rainfall in the eastern suburbs along the Great Dividing Range nudges per year. The majority of Toowoombas rain falls from November to March, with January and February being the peak rainy months. Like most of south-east Queensland, severe &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s can be a threat and Toowoomba may occasionally be affected by ex-tropical &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20Cyclone\"&gt;cyclones&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitecture and Heritage.\nToowoomba's history has been preserved in its buildings. Examples of architecture drawing from the city's wealthy beginnings include &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba%20City%20Hall\"&gt;Toowoomba City Hall&lt;/a&gt; which was Queensland's first purpose-built town hall, the National Trust &lt;a href=\"Drayton%2C%20Queensland%23Royal%20Bull%27s%20Head%20Inn\"&gt;Royal Bull's Head Inn&lt;/a&gt; and many examples in the heritage-listed Russell Street. Immediately to the east of the CBD is the Caledonian Estate, an area of turn-of-the-20th-century housing, ranging from humble workers cottages to large stately homes, in the classic wooden &lt;a href=\"Queenslander%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;Queenslander&lt;/a&gt; style.\nToowoomba is also home to the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Theatre%2C%20Toowoomba\"&gt;Empire Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally opened in June 1911, as a silent &lt;a href=\"movie%20house\"&gt;movie house&lt;/a&gt;. In February 1933, fire broke out, almost completely destroying the building. However, the Empire was rebuilt and reopened in November 1933. The architectural styling of the new Empire Theatre was &lt;a href=\"art%20deco\"&gt;art deco&lt;/a&gt;, in keeping with the trend of the 1930s. After years of neglect, the Empire Theatre was extensively renovated in the late 1990s, but retains much of its art deco architecture and decorations, especially the &lt;a href=\"proscenium\"&gt;proscenium&lt;/a&gt; arch. Able to seat approximately 1,500 people, the Empire Theatre is now the largest regional theatre in Australia.\nThe city also is home to the &lt;a href=\"Cobb%20%26amp%3B%20Co%20Museum\"&gt;Cobb &amp; Co Museum&lt;/a&gt;, hailing to the famous mail company's beginnings as a small mail run in the 1800s to transport mail and passengers to &lt;a href=\"Brisbane\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. It also houses Australia's largest collection of horse-drawn vehicles. The museum has undergone a A$8\u00a0million redevelopment before reopening in September 2010.\nHeritage listings.\nToowoomba has many &lt;a href=\"heritage-listed\"&gt;heritage-listed&lt;/a&gt; sites, with over fifty on the &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20Heritage%20Register\"&gt;Queensland Heritage Register&lt;/a&gt; in addition to listings on other local heritage registers.\nGovernance.\nToowoomba is the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba%20Region\"&gt;Toowoomba Region&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"local%20government%20areas%20of%20Queensland\"&gt;local government area&lt;/a&gt;. The city is represented in the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Queensland\"&gt;Parliament of Queensland&lt;/a&gt; by three seats: &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20district%20of%20Toowoomba%20North\"&gt;Toowoomba North&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20district%20of%20Toowoomba%20South\"&gt;Toowoomba South&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20district%20of%20Condamine\"&gt;Condamine&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Commonwealth Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, Toowoomba forms part of the &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20Groom\"&gt;Division of Groom&lt;/a&gt;, which is held by &lt;a href=\"Garth%20Hamilton\"&gt;Garth Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20National%20Party%20of%20Queensland\"&gt;Liberal National Party of Queensland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe current Mayor of Toowoomba is Mayor Paul Antonio, who was elected in 2012 and is currently serving his third term. Antonio was fined nearly $15,000 after he was found to have engaged in misconduct in his dealings with the Melbourne-to-Brisbane Inland Railway project where Mayor Antonio personally paid $4,900 to have an alternate route for the project investigated, which took the line to the very edge of his quarry.\nCrime.\nToowoomba has had a large amount of crime over the past years, but is still on average less than other parts of Queensland. In 2018, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Automobile%20Club%20of%20Queensland\"&gt;Royal Automobile Club of Queensland&lt;/a&gt; described Toowoomba as \"one of Queensland's car theft hot spots\", noting that there were insurance claims for over 3,000 cars stolen over a three-year period from &lt;a href=\"Harristown%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Harristown&lt;/a&gt; alone.\nEconomy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Defence%20Force\"&gt;Australian Defence Force&lt;/a&gt; is also present in the local community, with the city providing housing and amenities for many of the personnel based at the &lt;a href=\"Oakey%20Army%20Aviation%20Centre\"&gt;Oakey Army Aviation Centre&lt;/a&gt; (in Oakey, NW of Toowoomba) and Borneo Barracks at Cabarlah to the city's North. The headquarters of Heritage Bank, which is Australia's largest mutual bank, FK Gardners and Wagners are located in Toowoomba.\nEducation.\nToowoomba is a major education centre with a strong presence of boarders from Western Queensland attending Schools such as Toowoomba Grammar, Fairholme College, Downlands College and The Glennie School.\nPrimary.\nState\nPrivate/Religious\nSecondary.\nState\nPrivate/Religious\nCulture.\nFestivals.\nToowoomba is nationally renowned for the annual Carnival of Flowers, held each year in September. Many of the city's major parks and gardens are especially prepared for the carnival, including an important home garden competition and parade of flower floats. Buses bring people from around the nation, and a popular way to arrive at the carnival from &lt;a href=\"Brisbane\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; is on chartered antique steam and diesel trains, which captures the yester-year aspect of travel to Toowoomba with 19th-century wooden carriages.\nIn 1953 the Carnival of Flowers was the subject of a sponsored film produced by the Queensland Minister for Lands and Irrigation. The \"Carnival of Flowers\" depicts the floral parade, the home gardens competition and the crowning of the Floral Queen and is a wonderful portrait of life in 1950s Queensland.\nIn 2009 as part of the &lt;a href=\"Q150\"&gt;Q150&lt;/a&gt; celebrations, Carnival of Flowers was announced as one of the &lt;a href=\"Q150%20Icons\"&gt;Q150 Icons&lt;/a&gt; of Queensland for its role as an \"Events and festivals\".\nThe Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers received the Gold Award for Major Festival and Event at the Queensland Tourism Awards in 2015, 2016 &amp; 2017, and Australian Tourism Awards in 2016 &amp; 2017. In 2017, 255,639 people recorded as having attended the event\nToowoomba also hosts 'First Coat Art and Music Festival'. First Coat is a street art festival, held annually in May. As a result of the festival, over 50 pieces of large-scale, public art exist throughout the Toowoomba CBD, which has led to a transformation of previously underutilised lane and alleyways, as well as a reduction in costs associated with graffiti management.\nToowoomba was previously home to &lt;a href=\"Easterfest\"&gt;Easterfest&lt;/a&gt; (which was held annually over the Easter weekend.) The event has not continued after 2015.\nThe \"Food and Wine Festival\", which usually spans for 3 days, happens every year at Carnival of flowers time. It provides entertainment, food and drinks and is a spectacle of the Carnival.\nFood.\nToowoomba is also home to the &lt;a href=\"Weis%20Bar\"&gt;Weis Bar&lt;/a&gt; (until 2020 when production ceases and moves to Minto, NSW), &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.homeicecream.com/about.cfm\"&gt;Home Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.homestylebake.com.au/\"&gt;Homestyle Bake&lt;/a&gt; and possibly the &lt;a href=\"Lamington\"&gt;Lamington&lt;/a&gt;. Toowoomba has a thriving cafe and restaurant scene that is often compared to Melbourne in its maturity and depth.\nSport.\n&lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league\"&gt;Rugby league&lt;/a&gt; is a popular sport in Toowoomba. A team representing Toowoomba used to compete in the &lt;a href=\"Bulimba%20Cup\"&gt;Bulimba Cup&lt;/a&gt; tournament. Toowoomba currently does not host a team in any of the major national competitions but was home to the &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba%20Clydesdales\"&gt;Toowoomba Clydesdales&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20Cup\"&gt;Queensland Cup&lt;/a&gt; state league. \nThe Clydesdales were the feeder team for &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20Broncos\"&gt;Brisbane Broncos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;National Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; (NRL) from 1999 to 2006. The Clysedales dropped out of the Queensland Cup after the 2006 season due to financial difficulties and are no longer a feeder club for the Brisbane Broncos. In 2018 a game will be held between the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Titans\"&gt;Gold Coast Titans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"St%20George%20Illawarra%20Dragons\"&gt;St George Illawarra Dragons&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, 25 March at the &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba%20Sports%20Ground\"&gt;Toowoomba Sports Ground&lt;/a&gt;.\nTowoomba features a semi-professional football club, &lt;a href=\"South%20West%20Queensland%20Thunder\"&gt;South West Queensland Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, that has a large following within the community.

The Tour of Toowoomba in 2010 became a round of the Subaru National Road Series and attracted 15 teams. A proposal to stage a National Road Series event in Toowoomba was first presented to the Toowoomba Cycling Club in late 2009 by John Osborne OAM, a lifelong cycling enthusiast. The inaugural FKG Tour of Toowoomba was won by Patrick Shaw riding for the Virgin Blue RBS Morgan team. Patrick was later named Cycling Australia's Road Cyclist of the Year \u2013 2010.\nFounded in 1950, the Toowoomba Auto Club ran races at the nearby &lt;a href=\"Leyburn%20Airfield\"&gt;Leyburn Airfield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lowood%20Airfield%20Circuit\"&gt;Lowood Airfield Circuit&lt;/a&gt;s in the 1950s and 1960s, and also ran races on the streets of &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ridge%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Middle Ridge&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Carnival of Flowers in 1958, 1960 and 1961, with the feature races won by &lt;a href=\"Glynn%20Scott\"&gt;Glynn Scott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alec%20Mildren\"&gt;Alec Mildren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Glass\"&gt;Arnold Glass&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The club built the Echo Valley facility, initially as a &lt;a href=\"hillclimbing\"&gt;hillclimbing&lt;/a&gt; venue officially opened on 18 September 1966, with the facility now operating as a &lt;a href=\"motocross\"&gt;motocross&lt;/a&gt; track.

There is also the &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba%20Hospice\"&gt;Toowoomba Hospice&lt;/a&gt; which is a community-based private healthcare facility which provides palliative care to the terminally ill.\nWater.\nToowoomba's third water storage Cressbrook Dam was completed in 1983 and supplied water to Toowoomba in 1988. It has a full capacity of about bringing total capacity of the three dams, Cooby, Perseverance, and Cressbrook, to . The city also has underground supplies in fractured &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt; of the rock unit known as the Main Range Volcanics. Toowoomba also sits above the eastern edge of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Artesian%20Basin\"&gt;Great Artesian Basin&lt;/a&gt; and to the west underground water is available beneath unconsolidated &lt;a href=\"alluvium\"&gt;alluvium&lt;/a&gt;.\nRainfall during the period from 1998 to 2005 was 30% below the long term average, consistent with a prolonged drought; with this trend continuing through to the spring of 2007. In mid-2005, the water situation for the city was becoming critical with water supply levels below 30%. Environmental flows from Cressbrook Dam into Cressbrook Creek were allowed to cease as Toowoomba approached level five water restrictions. During March 2006 the surface water storage in the dams fell below 25% of full capacity, falling further to 12.8% on 10 March 2008 and reaching an all-time low of 7.7% in December 2009.\nThe former Toowoomba Mayor &lt;a href=\"Di%20Thorley\"&gt;Di Thorley&lt;/a&gt; proposed a controversial potable reuse project under the Toowoomba Water Futures plan which would result in water reclaimed from the Wetalla Sewage Treatment Plant being returned to Cooby Dam to provide 25% of the potable water supply for Toowoomba. Other water supply options include importing water from Oakey Creek Groundwater Management Area (average TDS 1660\u00a0mg/L), importing water from Condamine Groundwater Management Area (average TDS 740\u00a0mg/L), and water from coal seam gas production (TDS 1200\u20134300\u00a0mg/L).\nOn 29 July 2006, Toowoomba City Council conducted a poll of Toowoomba residents on the proposal to use this multi-barrier filtration system for filtering sewage for drinking purposes. The poll question was: \"Do you support the addition of purified recycled water to Toowoomba's water supply via Cooby Dam as proposed by Water Futures \u2013 Toowoomba?\" 38% of voters supported the proposal and 62% opposed. This meant that despite dams reaching critical levels, the city &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba%20Water%20Futures%20referendum%2C%202006\"&gt;rejected the use of recycled water in a plebiscite&lt;/a&gt;. Since the public rejection in 2006 of adding recycled sewage to the drinking water supply, water conservation measures have included harvesting stormwater for use in public parks and adding filtered groundwater to the town water supply. The city was under level 5 water restrictions as of 26 September 2006. This prohibits residents from using town water on their lawns, gardens or cars, and residents are strongly urged to cut down on water consumption.\nIn 2007, the Toowoomba City Council commenced a bore drilling program to augment the dwindling dam supplies and constructed several subartesian bores across the city and one artesian bore at Wetalla in the city's north. Many of the subartesian bores provided potable water with a reliable yield and have been developed into production however the artesian bore's water quality was very poor, prohibiting development as a potable source. This was an expensive setback for the city as the cost was over A$2\u00a0million for drilling to over . In January 2008, yield testing had been stalled due to the unavailability of appropriate pumping equipment. The Toowoomba Regional Council began supplementing the city's water supply with bore water from the Great Artesian Basin in September 2009. &lt;a href=\"Groundwater\"&gt;Groundwater&lt;/a&gt; has become a significant contributor to the city's water supply needs and now constitutes one third of the total volume of water treated for reticulated supply ( per week).\nThe state government has built a $187\u00a0million pipeline from &lt;a href=\"Wivenhoe%20Dam\"&gt;Wivenhoe Dam&lt;/a&gt; to Toowoomba. Water pumping along the pipeline to Cressbrook Dam began in January 2010.\nDemographics.\nAt the , the Urban Centre of Toowoomba recorded a population of 100,032 people. Of these:\nSister cities.\nToowoomba has &lt;a href=\"sister%20city\"&gt;sister city&lt;/a&gt; relations with three international cities: &lt;a href=\"Wanganui%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Wanganui, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Takatsuki%2C%20Osaka\"&gt;Takatsuki, Japan&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Paju\"&gt;Paju, South Korea&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe 2016 Australian census recorded the following statistics for religious affiliation in Toowoomba: Roman Catholic 23.2%; Anglican 19.0%; Uniting Church 5.9%; Lutheran 4.0%; Presbyterian 3.7%; Other Christian 4.6%; Pentecostal 1.8%; Baptist 1.5%; Islam 1.0%; Church of Christ 0.9%.\nToowoomba Wesleyan Methodist Church is at 267 North Street, &lt;a href=\"Wilsonton%20Heights%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Wilsonton Heights&lt;/a&gt; (). It is part of the &lt;a href=\"Wesleyan%20Methodist%20Church%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nToowoomba Chinese Wesleyan Methodist Church is at 21 Kookaburra Court, &lt;a href=\"Glenvale%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Glenvale&lt;/a&gt; (). It is part of the &lt;a href=\"Wesleyan%20Methodist%20Church%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHarrison (2006) has noted the appeal of Toowoomba as 'fertile ground' for fundamentalist Christian movements, particularly those with a religio-political outlook. This was exemplified by the &lt;a href=\"Logos%20Foundation%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Logos Foundation&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Carter%20%28evangelist%29\"&gt;Howard Carter&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s."
