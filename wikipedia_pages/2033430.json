A distinctive feature of his appearance during his years as a child actor was his &lt;a href=\"pageboy\"&gt;pageboy&lt;/a&gt; haircut, which inspired thousands of parents of that era to imitate the look for their young sons. His role on the show led him to be known as \"America's little brother.\"\nPersonal life.\nGrowing up as a child actor, Rich lived in &lt;a href=\"Granada%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Granada Hills, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, with his parents and younger brother.

He was active in sports, including &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, bicycle riding, skateboarding, and swimming.

He almost died of a &lt;a href=\"Valium\"&gt;Valium&lt;/a&gt; overdose in 1989.
