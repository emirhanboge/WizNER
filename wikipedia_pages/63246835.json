    "text": "Nicias (; died circa 20 BCE) was a ruler of the island of &lt;a href=\"Kos\"&gt;Kos&lt;/a&gt; under Roman rule, during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Second Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; and the early reign of &lt;a href=\"Augustus\"&gt;Augustus&lt;/a&gt;. He is known from coinage, inscriptions, and anecdotes in ancient literary sources. Ancient sources call him a &lt;a href=\"tyrant\"&gt;tyrant&lt;/a&gt;. The desecration of his tomb may have prompted the &lt;a href=\"Nazareth%20Inscription\"&gt;Nazareth Inscription&lt;/a&gt;.\nReign.\nThe date of Nicias' coinage and of anecdotes about him in literary sources indicate that he ruled during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Second Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; and into the reign of &lt;a href=\"Augustus\"&gt;Augustus&lt;/a&gt;. He appears to have led a regime at Cos that supported Augustus' opponent &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Antony\"&gt;Mark Antony&lt;/a&gt; and to have remained in power after Augustus defeated Antony at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Actium\"&gt;Battle of Actium&lt;/a&gt; in 31 BC. \n&lt;a href=\"Claudius%20Aelianus\"&gt;Aelian&lt;/a&gt; reports in his &lt;a href=\"Varia%20Historia\"&gt;Varia Historia&lt;/a&gt; that Nicias had a sheep that gave birth to a lion, which was a sign that he would be tyrant. Kostas Buraselis identifies this story as a literary trope, designed to reinforce a ruler's legitimacy and perhaps also indicating that Nicias came from low birth. Anna Heller accepts the former possibility, but is sceptical about the latter.\nBronze coins created during Nicias' rule begin around 50 BCE. On the obverse they have a portrait of a \"young man with rather curly hair, broad forehead, hooked nose, some sparse chin hair, and a serious expression conveyed by his eyes and the downward line of his lips\" and the legend \"Nicias\" (). On the reverse, they have a portrait of &lt;a href=\"Asclepius\"&gt;Asclepius&lt;/a&gt; (the patron god of Kos) and two legends, one naming the annual mint magistrate and another reading \"of the Koans\" () Nicias wears a headband, which has been identified by some scholars as a &lt;a href=\"diadem\"&gt;diadem&lt;/a&gt; (the symbol of kingship in the &lt;a href=\"Hellenistic%20period\"&gt;Hellenistic period&lt;/a&gt;), a wreath, or an \"infula\" - a knotted band associated with sacred beings and designed to assimilate him to the god Asclepius. \nAltars.\nMore than twenty little stone altars associated with Nicias have been found on Kos, all of which bear an identical text:\nThe number and modest size of these altars indicates that they were originally set up in private houses. The uniformity of their inscriptions suggests that they were erected in response to a decree - perhaps from Nicias himself. The inscription on these altars closely identifies Nicias with Kos and its people, presenting his devotion to the state as equivalent to the &lt;a href=\"filial%20piety\"&gt;filial piety&lt;/a&gt; of a son to his father. This is the first attestation of the title \"son of the People (\"damos\", &lt;a href=\"Doric%20Greek\"&gt;Doric Greek&lt;/a&gt; for \"demos\"),\" which would become a common honorific for civic benefactors in the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Imperial period&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, Greek individuals are named with a &lt;a href=\"patronymic\"&gt;patronymic&lt;/a&gt; (the name of their father), but this is absent from all the altars. Kostas Buraselis suggests that this was intended to present him as a 'man of the people', to obscure a humble birth, and to present himself as semi-divine. According to Anna Heller, the association with a humble birth is unpersuasive, and the lack of the patronymic should be understood as an effort to emphasise Nicias' filial devotion to Kos and a result of the novelty of the \"son of the People\" title. The formula \"for the well-being of\" derives from dedications erected in honour of Hellenistic kings.\nPosthumous fate and reputation.\nAfter his death, Nicias was remembered as a tyrant. The geographer &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt; calls him a tyrant who was opposed by the \"renowned harper\" Theomnestus.\nA bust of a child, known only from a short report and photography published by G. Iakopich in 1928, bears a &lt;a href=\"graffiti\"&gt;graffito&lt;/a&gt; reading \"Nicias the tyrant\" that may form part of a denigration of Nicias following his death. \nAccording to a poem on Nicias by the epigrammatist &lt;a href=\"Crinagoras%20of%20Mytilene\"&gt;Crinagoras of Mytilene&lt;/a&gt; preserved in the &lt;a href=\"Palatine%20Anthology\"&gt;Palatine Anthology&lt;/a&gt;, Nicias' tomb was desecrated after his death:\nIn 2020, researchers showed that the &lt;a href=\"Nazareth%20Inscription\"&gt;Nazareth Inscription&lt;/a&gt;, an edict proclaimed by a Caesar, which banns the desecration of tombs and is sometimes connected with the tomb of Jesus, is made from Koan marble. They proposed that it might have bee issued by Augustus following the desecration of Nicias' tomb by the people of Kos.\nA decree from Kos, probably dating to the late first century AD, revises the list of priests of Apollo as part of a process of destroying and replaces \"all the inadmissibly and illegally engraved inscriptions\". The illegal priests seem to be those who served during Nicias' reign. Buraselis proposes that the long delay between Nicias' death and the reform of this list indicates that immediately after his death there was significant continuity, with positive and negative perspectives on him in conflict with one another."
