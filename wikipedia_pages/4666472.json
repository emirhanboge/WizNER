It is used for &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches, and is the home stadium of &lt;a href=\"NFC%20Veria%202019\"&gt;NFC Veria&lt;/a&gt;. It was built in 1925 by members of music and gymnastics association Megas Alexandros. The stadium holds about 7,000. It is situated off the city centre. Record attendance is 10,309 for a game between &lt;a href=\"Veria%20F.C.\"&gt;Veria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Panathinaikos%20F.C.\"&gt;Panathinaikos&lt;/a&gt; in 1970. However, during a game between &lt;a href=\"Veria%20FC\"&gt;Veria FC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PAOK%20FC\"&gt;PAOK FC&lt;/a&gt; there were about 12,000 fans, but most of them entered the stadium without a ticket. The stadium formerly held track races too but after the renovations in 2005 and 2007 the space for track runners was removed.\nRenovation.\nDuring 1997, Veria F.C. in co-operation with Municipality of Veria installed a roof at the west stand while, in 1998 an electronic scoreboard was installed. Again, in 2005 a lighting system was installed while the stadium capacity was greatly reduced due to the installation of seats to approximately 5,300. Although, in 2007 administration board of Veria &amp; the City's mayor agreed to the construction of a north and a south stand which increased the stadium capacity to 7,000. During the team's comeback to the &lt;a href=\"Superleague%20Greece\"&gt;Superleague&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 Veria applied some improvements to the stadium in order to be qualified to host the championship matches.\nIn 2013, Veria F.C. announced another renovation in the stadium. Since the beginning of the season due to security reasons the stands were upgraded as security rails were installed. Also due to damaged drainage system and an almost destroyed football field, in September 16, 2013 Veria announced the replacement of current drainage system and the reinstallation of a new football field. The replacement was expected to be complete by October 20, 2013. Veria F.C. was expected to use its stadium again in the local derby against &lt;a href=\"Aris%20Thessaloniki%20FC\"&gt;Aris&lt;/a&gt; in October 20. Also there are plans of another expansion in the near future while soon the electronic ticket will be available in Veria Stadium as well. In October 18, 2013 &lt;a href=\"Veria%20F.C.\"&gt;Veria&lt;/a&gt; announced that the renovation of stadium was over and the stadium was ready to host again Veria's fixtures in Superleague Greece. Except the pitch's replacement the stadium was painted in blue-crimson colours while new goalposts were installed. Last but not least the locker rooms and the stadium's entrance were improved too. So that the stadium is able to host International matches.\nVenues.\nIn summer of 2015 &lt;a href=\"Veria\"&gt;Veria&lt;/a&gt; and her stadium will host in &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Katerini\"&gt;Katerini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Larissa\"&gt;Larissa&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"2015%20UEFA%20European%20Under-19%20Championship\"&gt;2015 UEFA European Under-19 Championship&lt;/a&gt;.
