    "text": "Bruno Brivonesi (July 16, 1886 \u2013 1970) was an Italian admiral during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. His brother, &lt;a href=\"Bruto%20Brivonesi\"&gt;Bruto&lt;/a&gt;, was also an admiral.\nEarly life and career.\nBrivonesi was born in &lt;a href=\"Ancona\"&gt;Ancona&lt;/a&gt; in 1886, and he entered the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Naval%20Academy\"&gt;Italian Naval Academy&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"high%20school\"&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt;, in 1906. After graduating as an &lt;a href=\"ensign%20%28rank%29\"&gt;ensign&lt;/a&gt;, he joined the crew of the &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Italian%20battleship%20Regina%20Margherita\"&gt;\"Regina Margherita\"&lt;/a&gt;. In 1908 he participated in the rescue efforts after the &lt;a href=\"1908%20Messina%20earthquake\"&gt;1908 Messina earthquake&lt;/a&gt;, following which he received a Bronze Civil Medal.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Italian%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Italian Navy&lt;/a&gt; decided to use &lt;a href=\"airship\"&gt;airship&lt;/a&gt;s for its Air Service, Brivonesi attended the first &lt;a href=\"pilot%20%28aeronautics%29\"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; training programme, which took place in 1910 between &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigna%20di%20Valle\"&gt;Vigna di Valle&lt;/a&gt;. During breaks Brivonesi, along with the other &lt;a href=\"cadet\"&gt;cadet&lt;/a&gt;s (eight from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Italian%20Army\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; and four from the Navy), designed and built a &lt;a href=\"glider%20%28aircraft%29\"&gt;glider&lt;/a&gt;, which he later flew. After obtaining a dirigible pilot licence, he joined the crew of the airship \"P 2\", which was in the final stages of building. At the end on 1910, \"P 2\" was stationed in Campalto, &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;; Brivones took part in flights over &lt;a href=\"Northeastern%20Italy\"&gt;Northeastern Italy&lt;/a&gt; and later moved to &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; and took part in military exercises near &lt;a href=\"Casale%20Monferrato\"&gt;Casale Monferrato&lt;/a&gt; (in this instance, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Emanuel%20III\"&gt;Victor Emanuel III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Thaon%20di%20Revel\"&gt;Paolo Thaon di Revel&lt;/a&gt; were passengers on his airship).\nIn 1911, following the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Italo-Turkish%20War\"&gt;Italo-Turkish War&lt;/a&gt;, the Italian Navy sent \"P 2\" and another airship, \"P 3\", to &lt;a href=\"Libya\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;. On board \"P 2\", Brivonesi participated in some of the first &lt;a href=\"aerial%20warfare\"&gt;aerial warfare&lt;/a&gt; operations in history; his first action was a &lt;a href=\"reconnaissance\"&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt; mission over the &lt;a href=\"Zanzur\"&gt;Zanzur&lt;/a&gt; area on 5 March 1912, after which he took part in several reconnaissance and &lt;a href=\"bombing\"&gt;bombing&lt;/a&gt; missions, which earned him a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Medal%20of%20Military%20Valor\"&gt;Silver Medal of Military Valor&lt;/a&gt; and appointment to executive officer of the airship.\nBrivonesi went back to Italy at the beginning of 1913; as the Italian Navy was planning to equip its &lt;a href=\"capital%20ship\"&gt;capital ship&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"floatplane\"&gt;floatplane&lt;/a&gt;s, he attended a course in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; and obtained a floatplane pilot licence. He was then assigned to the battleship &lt;a href=\"Italian%20battleship%20Dante%20Alighieri\"&gt;\"Dante Alighieri\"&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"Curtiss%20Aeroplane%20and%20Motor%20Company\"&gt;Curtiss&lt;/a&gt; floatplane; during the test flight, however, his airplane crashed into the &lt;a href=\"sea\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt;, but he was uninjured. The plane was repaired and \"Dante Alighieri\" started a trip with stops in several Italian &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt;s; at each stop, Brivonesi performed test flights with his floatplane, and during one of these flights he reached a height of about 1,000 meters, a world record (for floatplanes) at that time. After the trip was over, Brivonesi went back to Venice and started flying with a newly acquired &lt;a href=\"Breguet%20Aviation\"&gt;Breguet&lt;/a&gt; floatplane.\nWorld War I.\nAt the beginning of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, the Italian Navy preferred airships over floatplanes, which were still considered to be unreliable, and Brivonesi was appointed executive officer of the airship \"Citt\u00e0 di Jesi\". On 23 May 1915, right before Italy's &lt;a href=\"declaration%20of%20war\"&gt;declaration of war&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, \"Citt\u00e0 di Jesi\" took off from &lt;a href=\"Ferrara\"&gt;Ferrara&lt;/a&gt; to carry out a bombing of the &lt;a href=\"Pula\"&gt;Pola&lt;/a&gt; naval arsenal, but the mission had to be aborted because of bad &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"engine\"&gt;engine&lt;/a&gt; problems. A month later, Brivonesi (with the rank of &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant\"&gt;Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;) was given command both of \"Citt\u00e0 di Jesi\" and of the Ferrara &lt;a href=\"air%20base\"&gt;air base&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 4 August 1915, Brivonesi flew \"Citt\u00e0 di Jesi\" on a new nocturnal attempt to bomb Pola; the airship was able to reach the &lt;a href=\"Goal\"&gt;objective&lt;/a&gt; and drop its &lt;a href=\"aerial%20bomb\"&gt;bombs&lt;/a&gt;, but was then hit by &lt;a href=\"anti-aircraft%20warfare\"&gt;anti-aircraft fire&lt;/a&gt;, which pierced the &lt;a href=\"envelope\"&gt;envelope&lt;/a&gt;, that started leaking &lt;a href=\"gas\"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt;. \"Citt\u00e0 di Jesi\" was able to get out of range of the AA guns, but gradually lost altitude and finally &lt;a href=\"ditch\"&gt;ditch&lt;/a&gt;ed in the sea, in front of the Austrian base. The six-man crew, including Brivonesi and a young &lt;a href=\"Raffaele%20de%20Courten\"&gt;Raffaele de Courten&lt;/a&gt;, was captured and sent to the &lt;a href=\"Mauthausen%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;Mauthausen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"prisoner-of-war%20camp\"&gt;prisoner-of-war camp&lt;/a&gt;. Conditions in Mauthausen were appalling, and 25% of the POWs (including 5,000 Italians) died there of &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"illness\"&gt;illness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cold\"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt;, although the treatment of &lt;a href=\"officer\"&gt;officer&lt;/a&gt;s was much better than the treatment of soldiers. Since prisoners who were declared invalid were repatriated, Brivonesi successfully simulated &lt;a href=\"tuberculosis\"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; and was repatriated in May 1917, following a &lt;a href=\"prisoner%20exchange\"&gt;prisoner exchange&lt;/a&gt;. For his action over Pola, Brivonesi was awarded a second Silver Medal of Military Valor; in 1933 he would write a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about this experience, \"Verso Mauthausen\" (\"Towards Mauthausen\").\nAfter returning to Italy, Brivonesi started flying again, now with the new &lt;a href=\"Macchi%20L.3\"&gt;Macchi L.3&lt;/a&gt; floatplanes, in Venice. He was later tasked with testing &lt;a href=\"aircraft\"&gt;aircraft&lt;/a&gt; produced by the Ducrot factory in &lt;a href=\"Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt;; after a short time he was appointed commander of a new naval air base in &lt;a href=\"Capua\"&gt;Capua&lt;/a&gt;, from where &lt;a href=\"Caproni\"&gt;Caproni&lt;/a&gt; bombers would have been used, but the war ended before the building of the base was completed.\nInterwar years.\nAfter the end of World War I Brivonesi was given command of the airship \"M 6\", based in &lt;a href=\"Ciampino\"&gt;Ciampino&lt;/a&gt; and later in &lt;a href=\"Grottaglie\"&gt;Grottaglie&lt;/a&gt;, and later of the airship \"PV 3\". In 1922 \"PV 3\" was caught in a &lt;a href=\"storm\"&gt;storm&lt;/a&gt; while flying near &lt;a href=\"Crotone\"&gt;Crotone&lt;/a&gt;; the dirigible crashed, but Brivonesi was able to save his crew, gaining another Silver Medal of Military Valor. His last dirigible command was one of the three &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin\"&gt;Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s ceded by &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; to Italy as war reparations.\nIn March 1923, when the &lt;a href=\"Regia%20Aeronautica\"&gt;Regia Aeronautica&lt;/a&gt; was created, part of the personnel of the Italian Navy air service chose to join the new &lt;a href=\"armed%20force\"&gt;armed force&lt;/a&gt;; Brivonesi instead decided to stay in the Navy. Between 1923 and 1929 Brivonesi, promoted to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Commander\"&gt;Lieutenant Commander&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=\"attach%C3%A9\"&gt;attach\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Nations\"&gt;League of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, holding various jobs in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween 1930 and 1931 he was commanding officer of the &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; \"Nicol\u00f2 Zeno\", and in 1932 he was given command of the &lt;a href=\"Taranto\"&gt;Taranto&lt;/a&gt; naval base defense. While in Taranto, on 8 February 1933, a &lt;a href=\"criminal\"&gt;criminal&lt;/a&gt; shot and killed one of his relatives; Brivonesi, though unarmed, pursued him across &lt;a href=\"rooftop\"&gt;rooftop&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"arrest\"&gt;arrest&lt;/a&gt;ed him. For this, he was awarded a Silver Civil Medal (later commuted into another Silver Medal of Military Valor).\nBrivonesi was then given command of the Italian Navy Detachment in &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; and of the Italian &lt;a href=\"Far%20East\"&gt;Far East&lt;/a&gt; Naval Command, which he held from 20 March 1934 to 1 September 1935. Back in Italy, he became a &lt;a href=\"liaison%20officer\"&gt;liaison officer&lt;/a&gt; between the Navy and the Air Force in Rome. Between 8 November 1935 and 6 September 1936, as a &lt;a href=\"Captain\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt;, he commanded the &lt;a href=\"heavy%20cruiser\"&gt;heavy cruiser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Italian%20cruiser%20Trento\"&gt;\"Trento\"&lt;/a&gt;, and between the end of 1936 and 1939 he was Naval Attach\u00e9 at the Italian &lt;a href=\"Embassy\"&gt;Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. In July 1938, by then a &lt;a href=\"Rear%20Admiral\"&gt;Rear Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, he commanded the &lt;a href=\"training%20ship\"&gt;training ship&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Italian%20training%20ship%20Amerigo%20Vespucci\"&gt;\"Amerigo Vespucci\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20training%20ship%20Dunay\"&gt;\"Cristoforo Colombo\"&lt;/a&gt; during a training cruise to &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. In 1939 he assumed command of the &lt;a href=\"Livorno\"&gt;Livorno&lt;/a&gt; Naval Academy.\nWorld War II.\nWhen Italy entered &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, on 10 June 1940, Brivonesi (by then a &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Admiral\"&gt;Vice Admiral&lt;/a&gt;) was the commander of the Italian naval forces in Libya, with seat in &lt;a href=\"Bengasi\"&gt;Bengasi&lt;/a&gt; (a command that he had assumed on 24 April of the same year). Under his command were the old &lt;a href=\"armoured%20cruiser\"&gt;armoured cruiser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Italian%20cruiser%20San%20Giorgio\"&gt;\"San Giorgio\"&lt;/a&gt;, one destroyer flotilla with four ships, one &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt; flotilla with four ships, two &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; flotillas with ten boats, six &lt;a href=\"gunboat\"&gt;gunboat&lt;/a&gt;s, one auxiliary &lt;a href=\"minelayer\"&gt;minelayer&lt;/a&gt; and three &lt;a href=\"tanker%20%28ship%29\"&gt;tanker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOn 18 August 1940 Brivonesi sailed from Bengasi on board the auxiliary minelayer \"Monte Gargano\"; after evading an attack by &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Rorqual%20%28N74%29\"&gt;\"Rorqual\"&lt;/a&gt;, the ship rendesvouzed with the submarine &lt;a href=\"Italian%20submarine%20Iride\"&gt;\"Iride\"&lt;/a&gt; and the torpedo boat in the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Bomba\"&gt;Gulf of Bomba&lt;/a&gt; for the preparations of Operation G.A. 1, a first attempt by the &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Light%20Flotilla\"&gt;Tenth Light Flotilla&lt;/a&gt; to attack the harbour of &lt;a href=\"Alexandria\"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;. \"Monte Gargano\" was there to act as a replenishment ship for the other two vessels. British aircraft flying nearby, however, noticed the unusual presence of three ships in the usually deserted Gulf of Bomba, and &lt;a href=\"Fairey%20Swordfish\"&gt;Fairey Swordfish&lt;/a&gt; torpedo bombers were sent to attack them on 22 August: both \"Iride\" and \"Monte Gargano\" were sunk, thus sanctioning the failure of the operation before it could start. Brivonesi and the entire crew of \"Monte Gargano\" were able to abandon ship before she capsized and sank in shallow waters.\nOn 24 April 1941, Brivonesi left Libya and assumed command of the 3rd Naval Division (&lt;a href=\"heavy%20cruiser\"&gt;heavy cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Italian%20cruiser%20Trento\"&gt;\"Trento\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italian%20cruiser%20Trieste\"&gt;\"Trieste\"&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Italian%20cruiser%20Bolzano\"&gt;\"Bolzano\"&lt;/a&gt;), based in &lt;a href=\"Messina\"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt;, with \"Trieste\" as flagship.\nOn 24 May 1941, Brivonesi's 3rd Division (\"Trieste\", \"Bolzano\" and the destroyers \"Ascari\", \"Lanciere\" and \"Corazziere\") was providing distant escort to a troop convoy (four &lt;a href=\"troop%20transport\"&gt;troop transport&lt;/a&gt;s with one destroyer and four torpedo boats as close escort), when &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Upholder%20%28P37%29\"&gt;HMS \"Upholder\"&lt;/a&gt; torpedoed one of the troopships, &lt;a href=\"SS%20Conte%20Rosso\"&gt;\"Conte Rosso\"&lt;/a&gt;, which sank with the loss of 1,297 men.\nBetween 26 and 29 September 1941, Brivonesi and the 3rd Division (\"Trento\", \"Trieste\", and &lt;a href=\"Italian%20cruiser%20Gorizia\"&gt;\"Gorizia\"&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the destroyers \"Ascari\", \"Lanciere\", \"Corazziere\" and \"Carabiniere\") sailed from Messina as part of the force tasked with countering &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Halberd\"&gt;Operation Halberd&lt;/a&gt;. The Italian force, however, did not meet the British force, and there was no battle.\nAs the commander of the 3rd Division, Brivonesi was the protagonist of the Italian defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Duisburg%20Convoy\"&gt;Battle of the Duisburg Convoy&lt;/a&gt;. On 8 November 1941, Brivonesi sailed from &lt;a href=\"Messina\"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt; with \"Trieste\", \"Trento\" and the 13th Destroyer Flotilla (\"Granatiere\", \"Bersagliere\", \"Fuciliere\", \"Alpino\") as distant escort of the \"Beta\" convoy (later known as the \"Duisburg\" convoy), which consisted in 7 merchant ships (the Italian &lt;a href=\"cargo%20ship\"&gt;cargo ship&lt;/a&gt;s \"Maria\", \"Sagitta\" and \"Rina Corrado\", the Italian tankers \"Conte di Misurata\" and \"Minatitlan\" and the German cargo ships \"Duisburg\" and \"San Marco\", laden with 389 vehicles, 34,473 long tons of munitions and &lt;a href=\"mat%C3%A9riel\"&gt;mat\u00e9riel&lt;/a&gt; and 17,281 long tons of &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt;) with a close escort of six destroyers (under the command of &lt;a href=\"Captain\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; Ugo Bisciani on \"Maestrale\"). The convoy was spotted by a British &lt;a href=\"reconnaissance%20plane\"&gt;reconnaissance plane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Force%20K\"&gt;Force K&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"light%20cruiser\"&gt;light cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Aurora%20%2812%29\"&gt;\"Aurora\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Penelope%20%2897%29\"&gt;\"Penelope\"&lt;/a&gt; and destroyers &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Lance%20%28G87%29\"&gt;\"Lance\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Lively%20%28G40%29\"&gt;\"Lively\"&lt;/a&gt;) sailed from &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; to intercept. The attack happened during the following night; Force K took the close escort by surprise, sank one destroyer (\"Fulmine\") and disabled another (\"Grecale\"), then proceeded to sink all the seven merchants, while the confused and disarticulated reaction of the other destroyers (left without orders, as \"Maestrale\"'s &lt;a href=\"radio\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; antenna was shot away) was unable to stop or damage the British ships. Brivonesi's 3rd Division, at the time of the attack (00:57 on 9 November), was sailing at 12 knots about three miles astern and to the east of the convoy. The Division only realized that the convoy was being attacked when they spotted the flash of the British guns; shortly before, at 00:30, \"Trieste\" had intercepted a coded message of unknown source and meaning (the source was Force K), and Brivonesi was about to send a general alert to all his ships, when the battle started. \"Trieste\" and \"Trento\" opened fire on Force K at 1:03, from a distance of 9,000-10,000 meters; Brivonesi's subsequent manoeuvre later drew heavy criticism: instead of turning southeast, where Force K was, to close in on the British ships and attack them at once, he turned starboard so that his cruisers could bring all guns to bear, which required several minutes. Brivonesi's ships briefly assumed a southerly course (thus distancing themselves from Force K even more), then turned to port and then to starboard, advancing at a speed of only 15-16 knots, less than half the speed that they could keep. Force K kept manoeuvring around the convoy so that the latter was constantly between the British ships and the Italian Division, which caused the blazing merchants and their smoke to hamper the aim of the Italian gunners. At 1:12 Brivonesi ordered to increase speed to 18 knots and at 1:25 to 24 knots, but by then the distance had risen to 17,000 meters, and he ordered to cease fire, as it was pointless. At 1:29 Brivonesi ordered to turn north, in order to intercept the Force K when the latter would turn back towards Malta (by then the convoy was completely destroyed). Meanwhile, however, &lt;a href=\"Supermarina\"&gt;Supermarina&lt;/a&gt; (the Italian Navy high command) had informed him that the risk of a &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20bomber\"&gt;torpedo bomber&lt;/a&gt; attack on his ships was high; as they were outside of Malta's aircraft's reach, Brivonesi believed that a British &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt; was in the area. Upon realizing that the fires of the disabled merchant ships lighted up his ships, making them easier targets for submarines as well as aircraft, Brivonesi ordered to cease fire, leave the area and assume a northwesterly course, at 1:32. Overall, \"Trieste\" and \"Trento\" had fired 207 8-inch &lt;a href=\"shell%20%28projectile%29\"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt;s, without scoring any hits. The 3rd Division only returned to the area after a few hours, to cover the &lt;a href=\"search%20and%20rescue\"&gt;search and rescue&lt;/a&gt; operation, during which the destroyer \"Libeccio\" was sunk by HMS \"Upholder\" and \"Trento\" was narrowly missed by a torpedo.\nFollowing this disaster, Brivonesi was removed from command and &lt;a href=\"court%20martial\"&gt;court martial&lt;/a&gt;led by the Rome &lt;a href=\"military%20tribunal\"&gt;military tribunal&lt;/a&gt; under accusation of \"loss of &lt;a href=\"naval%20ship\"&gt;naval ship&lt;/a&gt; (\u2026) caused by lack of adherence to usual engagement rules\". The &lt;a href=\"inquiry\"&gt;inquiry&lt;/a&gt; and trial, however, resulted in Brivonesi's acquittal, on 5 July 1942. Admiral &lt;a href=\"Angelo%20Iachino\"&gt;Angelo Iachino&lt;/a&gt; had spoken in favour of Brivonesi, and it is likely that his acquittal was also due to the will to cover up other responsibilities in the Navy commands, such as the unadequate training of the crews in nocturnal combat.\nAfter his acquittal, Brivonesi was appointed Adjunct Deputy &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Staff\"&gt;Chief of Staff&lt;/a&gt; at Supermarina and later given command of the &lt;a href=\"Sardinia\"&gt;Sardinia&lt;/a&gt; Naval Command, with seat in &lt;a href=\"La%20Maddalena\"&gt;La Maddalena&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 August 1943, &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Mussolini\"&gt;Benito Mussolini&lt;/a&gt;, following his destitution and arrest on 25 July, was sent to La Maddalena and confined there, under Brivonesi's responsibility. Mussolini despised Brivonesi since the Duisburg convoy disaster, and relations between them remained cold. On 27 August, Mussolini left La Maddalena to be imprisoned at &lt;a href=\"Campo%20Imperatore\"&gt;Campo Imperatore&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 7 September 1943, Brivonesi was summoned to Rome and informed by &lt;a href=\"Raffaele%20de%20Courten\"&gt;Raffaele de Courten&lt;/a&gt; that in a short time Germany and Italy may no longer have been allies, and that Italian forces would have to face hostile behaviour by the Germans. He went back to La Maddalena on 8 September, and there he learned from the radio of the &lt;a href=\"armistice%20of%20Cassibile\"&gt;armistice of Cassibile&lt;/a&gt;. Brivonesi's forces heavily outnumbered the German troops in the area, but they included &lt;a href=\"Blackshirts\"&gt;Blackshirts&lt;/a&gt; of doubtful allegiance, and most Italian navy personnel available were ragtag units of untrained and even unarmed men. Having received conflicting orders (by &lt;a href=\"general\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Basso\"&gt;Antonio Basso&lt;/a&gt;, his direct superior in Sardinia, to allow the Germans to pass through La Maddalena and evacuate their troops to &lt;a href=\"Corsica\"&gt;Corsica&lt;/a&gt;; by Supermarina, to capture German military equipment), Brivonesi did not organize any defense or order resistance, and was de facto taken prisoner in the Naval Command building by the German forces, who swiftly occupied all key points and military buildings in La Maddalena. After an \"agreement\" with the German commander, and in compliance with orders from Basso, Brivonesi ordered all his men not to react to the Germans, allowed the Germans to use the &lt;a href=\"harbour\"&gt;harbour&lt;/a&gt; to ferry their troops to Corsica, and \u2013 under German armed guard \u2013 made a tour of his positions (still manned by Italian personnel, who had kept their &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s) recommending \"calm\". The German occupation of La Maddalena had tragic consequences for the battle fleet, which had sailed from &lt;a href=\"La%20Spezia\"&gt;La Spezia&lt;/a&gt; heading there (where Brivonesi was to deliver to Bergamini some documents, including one with the conditions of the armistice): the ships had to turn away and were attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Luftwaffe\"&gt;Luftwaffe&lt;/a&gt;, which sank the battleship &lt;a href=\"Italian%20battleship%20Roma%20%281940%29\"&gt;\"Roma\"&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"Asinara\"&gt;Asinara&lt;/a&gt;, killing admiral &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Bergamini%20%28admiral%29\"&gt;Carlo Bergamini&lt;/a&gt; and 1,392 men. On 12 September, Brivonesi was put under arrest by the German commander. On 13 September, after days of tension, incidents broke out between Italians and Germans, following which the Italian forces, having been reorganized by &lt;a href=\"Captain\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Avegno\"&gt;Carlo Avegno&lt;/a&gt; (the commander of the La Maddalena Naval Base, who was later killed in the fighting), attacked the Germans and captured 250 prisoners. Brivonesi was released by the Germans to order his men to release the German prisoners and return their weapons to them; initially his men refused to comply, but the prisoners were freed on the following day. The Germans completed their evacuation and left La Maddalena on 14 September. Brivonesi remained in command of the Italian naval forces in Sardinia till 1944.\nBrivonesi left the Navy in April 1946. In 1952 a book by Antonino Trizzino, \"Navi e poltrone\", heavily criticized Brivonesi's behaviour on 9 November 1941, practically accusing him of &lt;a href=\"cowardice\"&gt;cowardice&lt;/a&gt;; Brivonesi &lt;a href=\"Lawsuit\"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; Trizzino for &lt;a href=\"defamation\"&gt;defamation&lt;/a&gt;, and he won at first instance, but lost on &lt;a href=\"appeal\"&gt;appeal&lt;/a&gt;. He spent his later life between Rome and Marche, and he died in Rome in 1970."
