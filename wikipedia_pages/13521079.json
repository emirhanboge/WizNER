    "text": "Letters to Jenny is a &lt;a href=\"collection%20of%20letters\"&gt;collection of letters&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=\"Piers%20Anthony\"&gt;Piers Anthony&lt;/a&gt; to Jenny Gildwarg, a 12-year-old girl who was run over by a drunk driver on December 9, 1988. The book also contains news of Jenny's progress after the accident.\nOrigin of the letters.\nJenny remained in a &lt;a href=\"coma\"&gt;coma&lt;/a&gt; for several weeks, occasionally making small movements. According to Anthony's notes, she regained consciousness fully paralyzed, being able to move only her eyes and one finger. Feeling that Jenny was losing hope, her mother wrote to Anthony, asking if he would write a letter to Jenny, as he was one of her favorite authors. Anthony corresponded regularly.\nJenny in fiction.\nAnthony wrote a letter to Jenny, proposing that he create a character patterned after her, in his next &lt;a href=\"Xanth\"&gt;Xanth&lt;/a&gt; book, \"&lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20View\"&gt;Isle of View&lt;/a&gt;\". The character is &lt;a href=\"Minor%20characters%20of%20Xanth%23Jenny%20Elf%20and%20Sammy%20Cat\"&gt;Jenny Elf&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Elfquest\"&gt;Elfquest&lt;/a&gt;\" variety (another of her favorite series), which has a pet cat named Sammy (Jenny Gildwarg was a lover of animals). Jenny Elf has become a regular character in the Xanth series.\nAnthony received a letter from Jenny's mother, in which she describes reading previous letter to Jenny. On asking her about the elf character, Jenny smiled.\nJenny's recovery.\nJenny since made much progress, communicating (at first) by blinking her eyes. Today, Jenny still uses a &lt;a href=\"wheelchair\"&gt;wheelchair&lt;/a&gt;."
