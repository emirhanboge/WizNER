    "text": "Glodwick is an area of &lt;a href=\"Oldham\"&gt;Oldham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Greater Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, England. It is south-east of Oldham town centre.\nGlodwick is a multi-ethnic residential area in the south of &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Oldham\"&gt;Oldham&lt;/a&gt;, home particularly to a large community of &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;is and &lt;a href=\"British%20Pakistanis\"&gt;British Pakistanis&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlodwick is marked architecturally by Oldham's history with the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href=\"Spinning%20%28textiles%29\"&gt;cotton spinning&lt;/a&gt;. Much of Glodwick's housing remain as red-brick terraces, built originally as dwellings for Oldham's many &lt;a href=\"cotton%20mill\"&gt;cotton mill&lt;/a&gt; workers.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Glodwick\" was recorded first as \"Glodic\" in the 1190s. The first element may be a &lt;a href=\"Common%20Brittonic\"&gt;Brittonic&lt;/a&gt; word related to &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; \"clawdd\", meaning \"ditch, hedge\". &lt;a href=\"Gloddaeth%20Hall\"&gt;Gloddaeth&lt;/a&gt; in Wales may have a similar etymology. The second part of the name is harder to explain, but may be the &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; \"dic\", likewise meaning \"ditch\", added later to the Brittonic word.\nMedieval history.\nLying within the &lt;a href=\"Historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;historic county boundaries&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Lancashire\"&gt;since the early 12th century&lt;/a&gt;, Glodwick, one of the oldest parts of Oldham, was recorded in 1212 as being one of five parts of the &lt;a href=\"thegn\"&gt;thegn&lt;/a&gt;age estate of Kaskenmoor, which was held on behalf of &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20England\"&gt;King John&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Roger%20de%20Montbegon\"&gt;Roger de Montbegon&lt;/a&gt; and William de Nevill. The other parts of this estate were &lt;a href=\"Shaw%20and%20Crompton\"&gt;Crompton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oldham\"&gt;Oldham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sholver\"&gt;Sholver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Werneth%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Werneth&lt;/a&gt;. Glodwick later formed part of the &lt;a href=\"township%20%28England%29\"&gt;township&lt;/a&gt; of Oldham within the ancient ecclesiastical parish of &lt;a href=\"Prestwich-cum-Oldham\"&gt;Prestwich-cum-Oldham&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Salford%20%28hundred%29\"&gt;hundred of Salford&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndustrial revolution.\nIn the late-19th and early-20th centuries, Glodwick provided a base for many of the &lt;a href=\"cotton%20mill\"&gt;cotton mill&lt;/a&gt;s that made Oldham the most productive &lt;a href=\"mill%20town\"&gt;mill town&lt;/a&gt; in the world. Spinning companies like Samuel Milne, Lees &amp; Wrigley, James Collinge &amp; Sons and &lt;a href=\"Bagley%20%26amp%3B%20Wright\"&gt;Bagley &amp; Wright&lt;/a&gt; brought employment to the area.\nRiots.\nIn May 2001, Glodwick was the centre of controversy as it was at the heart of the \"&lt;a href=\"Oldham%20Riots\"&gt;Oldham Riots&lt;/a&gt;\" - large scale rioting said to be fuelled by long-term under-lying racial tensions between local &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Asian\"&gt;South Asian&lt;/a&gt; communities. The rioting gained international media coverage, and were said to be the worst &lt;a href=\"race%20riot\"&gt;racially-motivated riots&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom for fifteen years prior, briefly eclipsing the sectarian violence seen in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandmarks.\nOne of Glodwick's best-known features is &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Park%2C%20Oldham\"&gt;Alexandra Park&lt;/a&gt;. Another prominent and well-used building is the Glodwick Pool (formerly Glodwick Baths) - a purpose built structure administered by Oldham Community Leisure.\nGreengate Street Mosque is Oldham's largest mosque.\nSt Mark's Church stands on the hill above Oldham at Glodwick. It is the parish church for the area.\nLowside Brickworks.\nClose to Glodwick is a disused quarry that has been designated as a &lt;a href=\"Site%20of%20special%20scientific%20interest\"&gt;Site of special scientific interest&lt;/a&gt; (SSSI) known as Lowside Brickworks. The site is only but has considerable geological interest. It has yielded &lt;a href=\"bivalves\"&gt;bivalves&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Carboniferous\"&gt;Carboniferous&lt;/a&gt; period showing how they interacted with the sediment, which also helps understanding of their &lt;a href=\"Morphology%20%28biology%29\"&gt;morphological variation&lt;/a&gt;. Lowside Brickworks is one of 21 &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Sites%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest%20in%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;SSSIs in the Greater Manchester area&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond World War.\nOn 24 December 1944, at 5.50am, a &lt;a href=\"V-1%20flying%20bomb\"&gt;V-1 flying bomb&lt;/a&gt; fell on Abbey Hills Road near to the junction with Warren Lane. The explosion killed 32 people and destroyed a large number of houses. The bomb was one of over thirty released that morning by a large formation of German &lt;a href=\"Heinkel%20He%20111\"&gt;Heinkel He 111&lt;/a&gt; bombers just off the &lt;a href=\"North%20East%20England\"&gt;North East coast of England&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransport.\nThere are a few bus services that serve the Glodwick area. &lt;a href=\"First%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;First Greater Manchester&lt;/a&gt;'s frequent 425 service runs through Glodwick to Holts Estate via Abbeyhills and to Fitton Hill via Oldham. First's 408 service runs a handful of service to &lt;a href=\"Stalybridge\"&gt;Stalybridge&lt;/a&gt; via Abbeyhills and &lt;a href=\"Shaw%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Shaw&lt;/a&gt; via Oldham during the day on weekdays, while &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Community%20Transport\"&gt;Manchester Community Transport&lt;/a&gt; runs an hourly evening service and &lt;a href=\"Stagecoach%20Manchester\"&gt;Stagecoach Manchester&lt;/a&gt; runs the Sunday service. The 410 and 411 services, operated by &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Community%20Transport\"&gt;Manchester Community Transport&lt;/a&gt;, provide a circular service around various parts of east Oldham running along Waterloo Street in Glodwick.\nThere is no railway station nearby, &lt;a href=\"Glodwick%20Road%20railway%20station\"&gt;Glodwick Road&lt;/a&gt; station having closed in 1955, but there is a nearby &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Metrolink\"&gt;Metrolink&lt;/a&gt; stop, which is &lt;a href=\"Oldham%20Mumps%20Metrolink%20station\"&gt;Oldham Mumps&lt;/a&gt;, currently providing links to Manchester and &lt;a href=\"Chorlton-cum-Hardy\"&gt;Chorlton&lt;/a&gt;."
