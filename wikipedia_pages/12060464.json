    "text": "Malva alcea (greater musk-mallow, cut-leaved mallow, vervain mallow or hollyhock mallow) is a plant in the &lt;a href=\"Malvaceae\"&gt;mallow family&lt;/a&gt; native to southwestern, central and eastern &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and southwestern &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; north to southern &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and east to &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nIt is a &lt;a href=\"herbaceous\"&gt;herbaceous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial plant&lt;/a&gt; growing to 50\u2013125\u00a0cm tall, with stems covered in stellate hairs, meaning they branch at the free end into several strands. The &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are 2\u20138\u00a0cm long and 2\u20138\u00a0cm broad, palmately lobed with five to seven blunt lobes; basal leaves on the lower stem are very shallowly lobed, those higher on the stems are deeply divided, with digitate finger-like lobes. The &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s appear singly near the apex of &lt;a href=\"corymb\"&gt;corymb&lt;/a&gt;ose &lt;a href=\"raceme\"&gt;raceme&lt;/a&gt;s growing from the leaf axils in summer to early fall. They are 3.5\u20136\u00a0cm diameter, with five &lt;a href=\"sepal\"&gt;sepal&lt;/a&gt;s and five bright pink &lt;a href=\"petal\"&gt;petal&lt;/a&gt;s, and have no scent. The bracteoles that make up the epicalyx are ovate and wide at the base where they are fused with the &lt;a href=\"sepal\"&gt;calyx&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; is a hairless disc-shaped &lt;a href=\"schizocarp\"&gt;schizocarp&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20138\u00a0mm diameter, containing several &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s, the seeds individually enclosed in a glabrous or hairy &lt;a href=\"mericarp\"&gt;mericarp&lt;/a&gt;. It has a &lt;a href=\"chromosome\"&gt;chromosome&lt;/a&gt; count of 2n=84.\nEcology.\nIt is most common in drier soils in thickets, along paths and in waste places. &lt;a href=\"Natural%20hybrid\"&gt;Natural hybrid&lt;/a&gt;s with the closely related \"&lt;a href=\"Malva%20moschata\"&gt;Malva moschata&lt;/a&gt;\" are occasionally found. In central Europe it grows at altitudes of up to 2,000 m.\nCultivation and uses.\nIt has been widely grown outside of its native range as an &lt;a href=\"ornamental%20plant\"&gt;ornamental plant&lt;/a&gt;. Several &lt;a href=\"cultivar\"&gt;cultivar&lt;/a&gt;s exist such as 'Fastigata', an upright form, and 'Alba', a white flowered form. In some areas, such as the northeastern &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the plant has escaped from cultivation and become &lt;a href=\"naturalisation%20%28biology%29\"&gt;naturalised&lt;/a&gt;. It is very similar to, and often confused with \"Malva moschata\"."
