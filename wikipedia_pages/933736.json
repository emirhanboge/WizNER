    "text": "The Saturn Nebula (also known as NGC 7009 or Caldwell 55) is a &lt;a href=\"planetary%20nebula\"&gt;planetary nebula&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"constellation\"&gt;constellation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aquarius%20%28constellation%29\"&gt;Aquarius&lt;/a&gt;. It appears as a greenish-yellowish hue in a small &lt;a href=\"amateur%20telescope\"&gt;amateur telescope&lt;/a&gt;. It was discovered by &lt;a href=\"William%20Herschel\"&gt;William Herschel&lt;/a&gt; on September 7, 1782, using a telescope of his own design in the garden at his home in &lt;a href=\"Datchet\"&gt;Datchet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, and was one of his earliest discoveries in his sky survey. The nebula was originally a &lt;a href=\"low-mass%20star\"&gt;low-mass star&lt;/a&gt; that ejected its layers into space, forming the nebula. The central star is now a bright &lt;a href=\"white%20dwarf\"&gt;white dwarf star&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"apparent%20magnitude\"&gt;apparent magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 11.5. The Saturn Nebula gets its name from its superficial resemblance to the &lt;a href=\"planet%20Saturn\"&gt;planet Saturn&lt;/a&gt; with its rings nearly edge-on to the observer. It was so named by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rosse\"&gt;Lord Rosse&lt;/a&gt; in the 1840s, when telescopes had improved to the point that its Saturn-like shape could be discerned. &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Smyth\"&gt;William Henry Smyth&lt;/a&gt; said that the Saturn Nebula was one of &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Wilhelm%20von%20Struve\"&gt;Struve's&lt;/a&gt; nine \"Rare Celestial Objects\".\nThe Saturn Nebula is a complex planetary nebula and contains many morphological and kinematic sub-systems in three dimensions. It includes a halo, jet-like streams, multiple shells, ansae (\"handles\"), and small-scale filaments and knots. The ansae are expanding non-radially from the central star. Although the ansae are most prominent in the Saturn Nebula, they are also visible in other planetary nebulae, including &lt;a href=\"NGC%203242\"&gt;NGC 3242&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cat%27s%20Eye%20Nebula\"&gt;NGC 6543&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NGC%202371-2\"&gt;NGC 2371-2&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe distance of the Saturn Nebula is not known precisely. estimates the distance to be 5,200 &lt;a href=\"light-years\"&gt;light-years&lt;/a&gt; (1.6 &lt;a href=\"parsec\"&gt;kpc&lt;/a&gt;). In 1963 O'Dell estimated it to be 3,900 light-years (1.2 kpc), which gives an approximate diameter of 0.5 light years for the object as a whole.\nThe central star, a very hot bluish dwarf with a temperature of 55,000 K, from which the nebula is believed to originate, has an absolute magnitude of +1.5, which equates to a luminosity of about 20 &lt;a href=\"Solar%20luminosity\"&gt;solar luminosities&lt;/a&gt; and a visual magnitude of 11.5. This strong ultraviolet irradiation from the central star creates the characteristic fluorescent green tint of the nebula via the radiation of doubly ionized oxygen. The object overall has a visual magnitude of 8 and a radial velocity of 28 miles per second towards the &lt;a href=\"Earth\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe nebula is 1 degree west of the star &lt;a href=\"Nu%20Aquarii\"&gt;Nu Aquarii&lt;/a&gt;. The central portion measures 25\u2033 \u00d7 17\u2033, while the outer shell extends to 41\u2033 \u00d7 35\u2033. The object is on many \"best of\" observing lists."
