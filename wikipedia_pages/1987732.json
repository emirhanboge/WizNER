    "text": "Benedict Wallet Vilakazi (6 January 1906 \u2013 26 October 1947) was a South African &lt;a href=\"Zulu%20people\"&gt;Zulu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"poet\"&gt;poet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"novelist\"&gt;novelist&lt;/a&gt;, and educator. In 1946, he became the first &lt;a href=\"black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; South African to receive a &lt;a href=\"PhD\"&gt;PhD&lt;/a&gt; Vilakazi Street in &lt;a href=\"Soweto\"&gt;Soweto&lt;/a&gt; is named after him and it is now famous as the place where both &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20Mandela\"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Desmond%20Tutu\"&gt;Desmond Tutu&lt;/a&gt; once lived.\nEarly life and education.\nBenedict Vilakazi was born Bambatha kaMshini in 1906 at the Groutville Mission Station near &lt;a href=\"KwaDukuza%2C%20KwaZulu-Natal\"&gt;KwaDukuza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KwaZulu-Natal%20Province\"&gt;Natal&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;), the fifth child of &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"religious%20conversion\"&gt;convert&lt;/a&gt;s Mshini ka Makhwatha and Leah Hlongwane: Mrs Leah Hlongwane Vilakazi, the daughter of Bangile who was the sister of Queen Ngqambuza, wife to Mpande ka Cetshwayo, and also the sister of the Right Reverend J Mdelwa Hlongwane ka Mnyaziwezulu, the son of Chief Matiwane.\nVilakazi split his childhood between herding the family &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt; and the local mission school until the age of 10, at which point he transferred to the St. Francis College in Mariannhill, a coeducational &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; secondary school founded by the local &lt;a href=\"Trappist\"&gt;Trappist monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Here he was baptized with the name \"Benedict Wallet,\" though at his mother's insistence he kept the family name of Vilakazi. He obtained a teaching certificate in 1923 and taught at Mariannhill and later at a &lt;a href=\"seminary\"&gt;seminary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ixopo\"&gt;Ixopo&lt;/a&gt;.\nWriting, teaching, research.\nIn 1933, Vilakazi released his first novel \"Nje nempela\" (\"Really and Truly\"), one of the first works of &lt;a href=\"Zulu%20language\"&gt;Zulu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fiction\"&gt;fiction&lt;/a&gt; to treat modern subject matter. He followed it in 1935 with the novel \"Noma nini\" as well as a poetry collection \"Inkondlo kaZulu\", the first publication of Western-influenced Zulu poetry.\nEarning a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;B.A.&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;University of South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in 1934, Vilakazi began work in the &lt;a href=\"Bantu%20language\"&gt;Bantu&lt;/a&gt; studies department at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Witwatersrand\"&gt;University of Witwatersrand&lt;/a&gt; in 1936 under &lt;a href=\"Linguistics\"&gt;linguist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clement%20Martyn%20Doke\"&gt;C. M. Doke&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he created a Zulu-English dictionary. Vilakazi's teaching position made him the first black South African to teach white South Africans at the university level.\nVilakazi's later novels continued to explore daily Zulu life, such as \"UDingiswayo kaJobe\" (1939) and \"Nje nempela\" (1944), the story of a traditionally polygamous household. His poetry, heavily influenced by &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;a href=\"Romantic%20Poetry\"&gt;Romantic&lt;/a&gt; styles, fused rhyme and stanza forms previously unknown in Zulu with elements of the \"izibongo\", traditional praise poetry. His poetry became increasingly political in the course of his life, dramatizing the exploitation of not only the Zulus but of black Africans generally. Both his novels and poetry were well received in his own lifetime and remain so today.\nVilakazi is also noted for his scholarly work on &lt;a href=\"oral%20history\"&gt;oral tradition&lt;/a&gt; and the Zulu and &lt;a href=\"Xhosa%20language\"&gt;Xhosa&lt;/a&gt; languages, which on 16 March 1946, earned him the first PhD to be won by a black South African.\nA year after receiving his doctorate, Benedict Wallet Vilakazi died in Johannesburg of &lt;a href=\"meningitis\"&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;.\nPosthumous honors.\nOn 28 April 2016, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Ikhamanga\"&gt;Order of Ikhamanga&lt;/a&gt; - Gold (OIG) was conferred on Dr Benedict Wallet Vilakazi posthumously\u201a for \"his exceptional contribution to the field of literature in indigenous languages and the preservation of isiZulu culture\".\nLegacy.\nVilakazi Street in &lt;a href=\"Soweto\"&gt;Soweto&lt;/a&gt; is the only street in the world where two Nobel Laureates once lived. It is where &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20Mandela\"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Desmond%20Tutu\"&gt;Desmond Tutu&lt;/a&gt; once lived and it was named in honour of Vilakazi.\nDr B.W. Vilakazi Secondary School in Zola 3, Soweto was named after the late Dr Vilakazi in order to commemorate his legacy."
