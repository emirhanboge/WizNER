Owing to ground reconstruction at &lt;a href=\"Hampden%20Park\"&gt;Hampden Park&lt;/a&gt;, the fixture was played at another stadium for the first time since &lt;a href=\"1924%20Scottish%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1924&lt;/a&gt;.\nRangers won the match 2\u20131, thereby securing a domestic &lt;a href=\"treble%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;treble&lt;/a&gt;. Rangers' scorers were &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Hateley\"&gt;Mark Hateley&lt;/a&gt;, scoring in his second consecutive &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;Scottish Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Murray%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Neil Murray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Richardson%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Lee Richardson&lt;/a&gt; scored Aberdeen's goal."
