    "text": "Stamford Street is a street in &lt;a href=\"Lambeth\"&gt;Lambeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southwark\"&gt;Southwark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, England, just south of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt;. It runs between &lt;a href=\"Waterloo%20Road%2C%20London\"&gt;Waterloo Road&lt;/a&gt; to the west and &lt;a href=\"Blackfriars%20Road\"&gt;Blackfriars Road&lt;/a&gt; to the east. It forms part of the A3200.\nThe street has a wide variety of buildings. There are two large &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20era\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt; terraces, a school and the entrance to a chapel from the 1820s; a &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; bank and hotel; an &lt;a href=\"Edwardian%20era\"&gt;Edwardian&lt;/a&gt; hospital now used for student accommodation; early 20th century industrial buildings now forming the Waterloo campus of &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20College%20London\"&gt;King's College London&lt;/a&gt;; office buildings from the 1930s and 70s; housing co-operatives from the 1980s and 90s; and a 21st-century residential tower with a second one under construction.\nAt the western end, in the middle of a large &lt;a href=\"roundabout\"&gt;roundabout&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"British%20Film%20Institute\"&gt;British Film Institute&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"London%20IMAX\"&gt;London IMAX&lt;/a&gt; Cinema.\nHistory.\nThe eastern end from Blackfriars Road to No. 40 (i.e. as far as the bend opposite Dorset House) was built c1790, with open gardens or fields to the west. The continuation westward to Broadwall was added c1803, and known as Upper Stamford Street. The extension from Broadwall to Waterloo Road was made in 1815 as part of the approach to Waterloo Bridge. In 1868 Upper Stamford Street was incorporated with Stamford Street and re-numbered.\nAt this time the Bankside area was a centre for hat-making. There were 7 hat-makers in Stamford Street in 1882. These are now commemorated only by the street Hatfields and the Mad Hatter Hotel.\nMost of the original houses of Stamford Street were demolished in the early 1900s and replaced with industrial buildings. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; the area suffered bomb damage, but Stamford Street was by-passed by post-war development of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Bank\"&gt;South Bank&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1977 a developer announced plans to build offices and Europe's tallest hotel on eight largely derelict sites around Coin Street. The Coin Street Action Group was set up to develop community-led alternative plans. The &lt;a href=\"Greater%20London%20Council\"&gt;Greater London Council&lt;/a&gt; owned half of the land and blocked the development, selling the site to Coin Street Community Builders in 1984, with the aim of making the area a better place to live, work and visit by creating a mix of uses. Between 1984 and 1988 derelict buildings were demolished, housing co-operatives were built, and a new park was created between Stamford Street and the riverside.\nBuildings.\nSouth Side.\nStarts at: &lt;a href=\"Blackfriars%20Road\"&gt;Blackfriars Road&lt;/a&gt;\n1 Stamford Street - a Grade II listed 4-storey commercial building, built c1870 in red brick with stone dressings.
