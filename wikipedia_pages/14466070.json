    "text": "TransXChange is a UK national XML based data standard for the interchange of bus route and timetable information between bus operators, the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20and%20Operator%20Services%20Agency\"&gt;Vehicle and Operator Services Agency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"local%20authorities\"&gt;local authorities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"passenger%20transport%20executive\"&gt;passenger transport executive&lt;/a&gt;s, and others involved in the provision of passenger information.\nThe format is a &lt;a href=\"UK\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; national de facto standard sponsored by the UK &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Transport\"&gt;Department of Transport&lt;/a&gt;. The standard is part of a family of coherent transport related &lt;a href=\"XML\"&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; standards that follow UK &lt;a href=\"GovTalk\"&gt;GovTalk&lt;/a&gt; guidelines and are based on the &lt;a href=\"European%20Committee%20for%20Standardization\"&gt;CEN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Transmodel\"&gt;Transmodel&lt;/a&gt; conceptual model.\nAlthough TransXChange is currently used mainly to exchange bus timetables, it may also be used for schedules for rail and other modes.\nHistory.\nTransXChange is intended as a successor to the widely used &lt;a href=\"ATCO-CIF\"&gt;ATCO-CIF&lt;/a&gt; format for bus timetables and was developed as a modernised representation of ATCO-CIF content, using an XML representation based on the &lt;a href=\"Transmodel\"&gt;Transmodel&lt;/a&gt; Reference model for Public Transport.\nTransXChange is supported by all main UK suppliers of bus timetable systems and has also been used to exchange data for metro and other modes.\nScope.\nTransXChange provides a rich model based representation of a bus timetable that can be used for a wide variety of purposes. TransXChange documents can be used to exchange the following information:\nTransXChange Schemas.\nTransXChange comprises:\nEach version of TransXChange is versioned in line with UK &lt;a href=\"GovTalk\"&gt;GovTalk&lt;/a&gt; guidelines.\nTransXChange Publisher.\nTransXChange is accompanied by a free tool, the TransXChange Publisher, which renders a TransXChange document into a human readable format, matrix and route map. PDF and html formats are supported.\nFuture development.\nAddition modules are envisaged to cover ticketing and fares through the proposed &lt;a href=\"FareXChange\"&gt;FareXChange&lt;/a&gt; standard. TransXChange can also be used for other &lt;a href=\"Mode%20of%20transport\"&gt;modes of transport&lt;/a&gt; - it is already used for metro and tram systems, route and timetable data."
