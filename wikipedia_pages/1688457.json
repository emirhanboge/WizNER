    "text": "Zalaegerszegi Torna Egylet Football Club (), commonly known as Zalaegerszegi TE, Zalaegerszeg or ZTE, is a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club from the city of &lt;a href=\"Zalaegerszeg\"&gt;Zalaegerszeg&lt;/a&gt; in Hungary. They are best known for beating &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the &lt;a href=\"2002-03%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20qualifying%20phase\"&gt;2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; qualifying stage. Zalaegerszeg has won one &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20League\"&gt;Hungarian League&lt;/a&gt; title in &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20I\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nZTE traces its roots back to 1912, at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Its first match was a 4\u20132 defeat to a team from &lt;a href=\"Vasv%C3%A1r\"&gt;Vasv\u00e1r&lt;/a&gt;. The team was first composed of members of a literary and debating society. ZTE flourished under coach &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zsef%20Vad%C3%A1sz\"&gt;J\u00f3zsef Vad\u00e1sz&lt;/a&gt;, but World War I halted its progress. In 1920, Zalaegerszegi TE, or \"Gymanistics Club of Zalaegerszeg,\" was born. They were defeated in their debut match, losing 2\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"AK%20Szombathely\"&gt;AK Szombathely&lt;/a&gt; on August 21, 1920, but were motivated by a crowd of over 2,000 fans.\nZTE's league history began in 1924, when they joined the Hungarian second division. The club won the title a decade later and entered the top flight in 1934. However, the start of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; under the regime of &lt;a href=\"Admiral\"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy\"&gt;Mikl\u00f3s Horthy&lt;/a&gt; saw ZTE's field and equipment confiscated. After the war, in 1957, ZTE merged with two other local teams, signalling the rebirth of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20team\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;.\n1990s.\nFrom then on to the 1990s, however, ZTE did not really challenge the Hungarian title much. The league was dominated by &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Ferencv%C3%A1rosi%20TC\"&gt;Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC&lt;/a&gt;. In 1994, ZTE managed to gain a solid foothold on the Hungarian first division.\n2000s.\nIn the 2000s, the club reached their zenith by winning the Hungarian League for the first time in the club history. In the &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20I\"&gt;2001\u201302&lt;/a&gt; season, Zalaegrszeg finished second in the first stage of the championship gaining 61 points while Budapest rivals &lt;a href=\"MTK%20Budapest%20FC\"&gt;MTK Budapest FC&lt;/a&gt; 64 points. In the championship play-off Zalaegerszeg secured their first ever league title and finished on 71 points and &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A9ter%20Bozsik\"&gt;P\u00e9ter Bozsik&lt;/a&gt;'s team overtook Budapest rivals Ferencv\u00e1ros and MTK Budapest along the way. &lt;a href=\"Kriszti%C3%A1n%20Kenesei\"&gt;Kriszti\u00e1n Kenesei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A1bor%20Egressy%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;G\u00e1bor Egressy&lt;/a&gt; were the key figures of the title-winning team by scoring 37 goals. In the &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20I\"&gt;2002\u201303&lt;/a&gt; season, Zalaegerszeg finished in the bottom half of the table and competed in the relegation play-offs. In the following seasons, ZTE would consolidate in the lower half of the table, finishing in 9th, 6th and 11th place respectively.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2002-03%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20qualifying%20phase\"&gt;2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; qualifying phase Zalaegerszeg defeated &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;n champions &lt;a href=\"NK%20Zagreb\"&gt;NK Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; on away goals.

In the second leg Zagreb was winning by 2\u20130 when in the 87th minute Zalaegerszeg was awarded a penalty which was scored by &lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%B3ri%C3%A1n%20Urb%C3%A1n\"&gt;Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Urb\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;. ZTE beat Zagreb on away goals. In the third qualifying round Zalaegerszeg faced English giants &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;. In the first leg, ZTE provided a stunning shock by winning 1\u20130 with a last minute goal from &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9la%20Kopl%C3%A1rovics\"&gt;B\u00e9la Kopl\u00e1rovics&lt;/a&gt;. However, in the return leg at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;, Man United won a convincing 5\u20130 victory. &lt;a href=\"Ruud%20van%20Nistelrooy\"&gt;Ruud van Nistelrooy&lt;/a&gt; scored in the 5th minute and in the 75th minute then &lt;a href=\"David%20Beckham\"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Scholes\"&gt;Paul Scholes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ole%20Gunnar%20Solskj%C3%A6r\"&gt;Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r&lt;/a&gt; scored. The English side progressed to the first group stage with a 5\u20131 aggregate victory.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2006-07%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20I\"&gt;2006\u201307&lt;/a&gt; season after nine rounds Zalaegerszeg was on the top of the league table. At the end of the season the club finished third securing a place in the European competitions of the &lt;a href=\"Intertoto%20Cup%202007\"&gt;Intertoto Cup 2007&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the spring of 2009 &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A1nos%20Csank\"&gt;J\u00e1nos Csank&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as the coach of the club. The success coach has already won two Hunagrian League titles with V\u00e1c and Ferencv\u00e1ros.\n2010s.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2010-11%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20I\"&gt;2010\u201311&lt;/a&gt; season Zalaegerszeg was competing for the Europa League position with Budapest rivals Ferencv\u00e1ros but ZTE finished fourth and could not secure a place for the qualifiers. In the &lt;a href=\"2011-12%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20I\"&gt;2011\u201312&lt;/a&gt; season Zalaegerszeg started the season with five consecutive defeats which resulted the dismissal of &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A1nos%20Csank\"&gt;J\u00e1nos Csank&lt;/a&gt;. He was replaced by former Ferencv\u00e1ros coach &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Prukner\"&gt;L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Prukner&lt;/a&gt;. The first half of the 2011\u201312 Hungarian League season was a nightmare for the club since they finished last gaining only 6 points without any victories. On April 21, 2012 Zalaegerszeg were relegated to the second division of the &lt;a href=\"Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20II\"&gt;Hungarian League&lt;/a&gt; after the defeat against titleholders &lt;a href=\"Videoton%20FC\"&gt;Videoton&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 15 May 2014, former Zalaegerszeg player &lt;a href=\"Gergely%20Kocs%C3%A1rdi\"&gt;Gergely Kocs\u00e1rdi&lt;/a&gt; was elected as director of the club.
