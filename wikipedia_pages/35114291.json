    "text": "William George (died 1756) was an English churchman and academic, Provost of &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;King's College, Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; from 1743 and &lt;a href=\"Dean%20of%20Lincoln\"&gt;Dean of Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; from 1748.\nLife.\nBorn in London, he was educated at &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton College&lt;/a&gt; and admitted to King's College, Cambridge, in 1715. He proceeded to his degree of B.A. 1719, M.A. 1723, and D.D. 1728. Leaving university, he became assistant-master, and eventually principal, of Eton, a position he held for around 15 years. George, a fine scholar, had little of the necessary touch with the boys, who in 1729 rioted spectacularly in a pupil rebellion, unique in Eton's history.\nIn 1731 George was a canon of Windsor and chaplain &lt;a href=\"in%20ordinary\"&gt;in ordinary&lt;/a&gt; to George II. His further advancement was a result of the backing of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Robert%20Walpole\"&gt;Sir Robert Walpole&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister. George left his scholastic career in 1743, when he was appointed to the vacant provostship of King's College, Cambridge: his race was a genuine contest with &lt;a href=\"John%20Chapman%20%28theologian%29\"&gt;John Chapman&lt;/a&gt;, also a candidate, but George succeeded by 28 votes to 10. The same year he was also elected vice-chancellor of Cambridge.\nIn 1747, the &lt;a href=\"deanery%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;deanery of Winchester&lt;/a&gt; fell vacant, and George was nominated; but for the sake of his friend &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Pegge\"&gt;Samuel Pegge&lt;/a&gt;, he exchanged it for the deanery of Lincoln, where he was installed in 1748. He also resigned in favour of Dr. Pegge his rectory of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Whittington\"&gt;Whittington, Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;. He died on 2 August 1756.\nWorks.\nGeorge was a popular preacher, and several of his sermons were printed, among them a sermon preached before the &lt;a href=\"Society%20for%20the%20Propagation%20of%20the%20Gospel\"&gt;Society for the Propagation of the Gospel&lt;/a&gt;, 1732, and a second delivered before the House of Commons in 1752. He was also a Greek scholar and Latin poet: some of his poems were in the \"Mus\u00e6 Etonenses\" (1755), edited by John Prinsep. Some lines on the death of &lt;a href=\"Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Frederick, Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt; were the topic of an anecdote of &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XIV\"&gt;Pope Benedict XIV&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamily.\nDuring his residence at Eton, George married Miss Bland, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Bland\"&gt;Henry Bland&lt;/a&gt;, his predecessor."
