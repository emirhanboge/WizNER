    "text": "Charleroi-West () is a secondary &lt;a href=\"railway%20station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt; serving &lt;a href=\"Charleroi\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of two railway stations located in downtown Charleroi, the other one being the much larger &lt;a href=\"Charleroi-South%20railway%20station\"&gt;Charleroi-South railway station&lt;/a&gt;. Charleroi-West is also a station of the &lt;a href=\"Charleroi%20Pre-metro\"&gt;Charleroi metro&lt;/a&gt;.\nRail station.\nCharleroi-West is a small, unstaffed station with no building or other services of its own, served only by &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20railway%20line%20140\"&gt;Belgian railway line 140&lt;/a&gt; linking Charleroi to &lt;a href=\"Ottignies\"&gt;Ottignies&lt;/a&gt;. Charleroi-West used to be a dead-end station (and thus the terminus of line 140) until 27 May 1987, when a rail connection to &lt;a href=\"Charleroi-South%20railway%20station\"&gt;Charleroi-South&lt;/a&gt; was opened. The 6\u00a0km industrial line 260 links Charleroi-Ouest with the freight &lt;a href=\"classification%20yard\"&gt;classification yard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Monceau-sur-Sambre\"&gt;Monceau-sur-Sambre&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause of its proximity to &lt;a href=\"Charleroi-South%20railway%20station\"&gt;Charleroi-South&lt;/a&gt; and the limited train service, Charleroi-West sees very little passenger traffic, with a weekday average of 75 boarding passengers on weekdays (20 on Saturdays, 30 on Sundays) in 2007.\nThe original station, inaugurated in 1855, was located slightly to the South. The current station was built between 1884 and 1886.\nTrain services.\nThe station is served by the following service(s):\nMetro station.\nWest () is a &lt;a href=\"Charleroi%20Metro\"&gt;Charleroi Metro&lt;/a&gt; station, located at the western end of &lt;a href=\"Charleroi\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt; downtown, in fare zone 1. The station is accessible through three distinct street entrances leading to a mezzanine, giving access to the central platform via escalators.\nThe station has been renovated in 2009, with a new decoration based on works of local artist Charles Szymkowicz. The mezzanine level hosts 11 reproductions of Szymkowicz's watercolor paintings depicting &lt;a href=\"Tuscany\"&gt;Tuscany&lt;/a&gt; landscapes, made by Belgian ceramist Maurice Joly. One of the station entrances is adorned with a 3.5 x 4m fresco depicting Szymkowicz and his mother passing the so-called \"viaduct\" bridge where the station is now located.\nTransfers.\n&lt;a href=\"Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20R%C3%A9gionale%20Wallonne%20du%20Transport\"&gt;TEC Charleroi&lt;/a&gt; bus lines 41, 43, 83, 85, 86 and Midi-Docherie."
