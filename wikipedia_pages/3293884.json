    "text": "Michael Dane Steele (born September 15, 1960) is a retired &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;. He was a company commander in the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Ranger%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;3rd Battalion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"75th%20Ranger%20Regiment\"&gt;75th Ranger Regiment&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Somalia\"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt; mission &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Gothic%20Serpent\"&gt;Operation Gothic Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hawk%20Down%20%28book%29\"&gt;now famous book&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hawk%20Down%20%28film%29\"&gt;film \"Black Hawk Down\"&lt;/a&gt;, wherein he was portrayed by actor &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Isaacs\"&gt;Jason Isaacs&lt;/a&gt;. He briefly appears in the documentary \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Am%20an%20American%20Soldier\"&gt;I Am an American Soldier&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSteele was investigated in conjunction with the murders of three unarmed Iraqis during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Iron%20Triangle\"&gt;Operation Iron Triangle&lt;/a&gt;. The four soldiers charged in the case testified that Steele had instructed them to \"kill all military-age males\". Steele denied giving such an order, and was formally reprimanded but not charged.\nBackground.\nSteele is from the small Southeastern town of &lt;a href=\"Statham%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Statham, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, and was born on September 15, 1960. He attended &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, where he was an &lt;a href=\"offensive%20lineman\"&gt;offensive lineman&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Bulldogs%20football\"&gt;Bulldogs football&lt;/a&gt; team, during the &lt;a href=\"Vince%20Dooley\"&gt;Vince Dooley&lt;/a&gt; era. In 1980, the Bulldogs were crowned national champions. Upon graduation, Steele was commissioned as an &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; officer through &lt;a href=\"Army%20ROTC\"&gt;Army ROTC&lt;/a&gt; in 1983. His first assignment was to the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Brigade\"&gt;Berlin Brigade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"West%20Berlin\"&gt;West Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. Later he received a &lt;a href=\"master%27s%20degree\"&gt;master's degree&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Central%20Michigan%20University\"&gt;Central Michigan University&lt;/a&gt;. His military education includes the following: &lt;a href=\"Airborne%20School\"&gt;Airborne School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20School\"&gt;Ranger School&lt;/a&gt;, Joint Power Control School, &lt;a href=\"Army%20Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20College\"&gt;Army Command and General Staff College&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation Gothic Serpent.\nIn August 1993, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; Steele deployed to &lt;a href=\"Mogadishu\"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt;, Somalia, commanding a &lt;a href=\"Company%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;rifle company&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"75th%20Ranger%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;75th Ranger Regiment&lt;/a&gt;. In October, Steele led his rifle company as part of Task Force Ranger, a force made up of various &lt;a href=\"special%20forces\"&gt;special forces&lt;/a&gt; units tasked with capturing two lieutenants of the Somali warlord &lt;a href=\"Mohamed%20Farrah%20Aidid\"&gt;Mohamed Farrah Aidid&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the afternoon of 3 October 1993, Task Force Ranger received intelligence that two leaders of Aidid's militia were at a residence in central Mogadishu. In response, the task force sent 19 aircraft, 12 vehicles, and 160 men to arrest them. At 1542 hours, in &lt;a href=\"Mogadishu\"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt;, Captain Steele &lt;a href=\"fast-roping\"&gt;fast-roped&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"UH-60%20Black%20Hawk\"&gt;UH-60 Black Hawk&lt;/a&gt; helicopter into the Bakara Market. The raid was to take 30 minutes and was meant to capture Omar Salad and &lt;a href=\"Abdi%20Hasan%20Awale%20Qeybdiid\"&gt;Abdi Hassan Awale&lt;/a&gt;, two top advisors to Warlord &lt;a href=\"Mohammed%20Farrah%20Aidid\"&gt;Mohammed Farrah Aidid&lt;/a&gt;. They and other prisoners were loaded into the vehicle convoy to be transported back to base. However, with the downing of two UH-60 Black Hawks, Super 61 (CW4 Cliff Wolcott) and Super 64 (CW3 &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Durant\"&gt;Mike Durant&lt;/a&gt;), the mission dramatically changed for the worse.\nThe Delta operators, and Rangers under the command of CPT Steele, provided security around the crash site of Super 61 and fought off thousands of armed insurgents through the night. After 15\u00bd hours of intense fighting, a convoy of armored vehicles arrived to take away the casualties. The Rangers then provided security around the convoy and fought their way out to the safety of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Operation%20in%20Somalia%20II\"&gt;United Nations forces&lt;/a&gt; base at the Pakistani Stadium, north of the Bakara Market. The outcome of the raid was 16 Rangers, &lt;a href=\"Delta%20Force\"&gt;Delta Force&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"160th%20Special%20Operations%20Aviation%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;160th SOAR&lt;/a&gt; personnel KIA and 89 WIA. In addition, two American soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division, one Pakistani soldier and one Malaysian soldier were killed in the extraction convoy. One more Delta operator was killed several days later when a mortar round struck the compound of Task Force Ranger. Durant was held captive for eleven days. Anywhere from 700\u20131,500 Somali militia were killed. Omar Salad was captured, as was Abdi Hassan Awale, but it was not the right Omar Salad. Captain Steele was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Star%20Medal\"&gt;Bronze Star&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Valor%20Device\"&gt;Valor Device&lt;/a&gt; for his actions as a commander during the fight.\nOperation Iraqi Freedom.\nSteele commanded the 3rd Brigade (Rakkasan) of &lt;a href=\"101st%20Airborne%20Division\"&gt;101st Airborne Division&lt;/a&gt; from June 2004 through November 2006. During his command, he oversaw the transformation of the unit from a traditional three battalion infantry brigade into a six battalion infantry brigade combat team composed of two infantry battalions, a reconnaissance squadron, a field artillery battalion, support battalion, and special troops battalion.\nSteele and his brigade deployed to Iraq the fall of 2005 and conducted operations primarily in &lt;a href=\"Saladin%20Governorate\"&gt;Saladin Governorate&lt;/a&gt;. In March 2006, the brigade planned and executed &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Swarmer\"&gt;Operation Swarmer&lt;/a&gt;, which was a joint U.S-Iraqi air assault operation targeting insurgents in the desert area to the northeast province of &lt;a href=\"Samarra\"&gt;Samarra&lt;/a&gt;. According to the US military, it was the largest air assault in Iraq since the start of Iraq War in 2003. In addition to Operation Swarmer, the brigade conducted numerous other brigade and battalion sized operations including Operation Katrina, Operation Rita, Operation(s) Red Light I, II and III, &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Swift%20Sword\"&gt;Operation Swift Sword&lt;/a&gt;, Operation Starlight, and &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Iron%20Triangle\"&gt;Operation Iron Triangle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 2006, Steele successfully completed his command with the 3rd Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division and was assigned as the Deputy G3, Training, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Forces%20Command\"&gt;United States Army Forces Command&lt;/a&gt; (FORSCOM) at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20McPherson\"&gt;Fort McPherson&lt;/a&gt;, Georgia, where he coordinated the training for CONUS based Army forces.\nIron Triangle Murders.\nFor killings of unarmed combatants during Operation Iron Triangle (2006), four soldiers were taken to an &lt;a href=\"Article%2032\"&gt;Article 32&lt;/a&gt; hearing, where they testified that Steele had told them to \"kill all military-age males.\" Steele refused to testify at the hearing for the accused soldiers, which is considered unusual for a commanding officer. He was investigated in connection with the incident and stated that he did not use \"specific language\" to order his soldiers to kill all military-age males, and that \"we don't shoot people with their hands up.\" He was not charged, but was later formally reprimanded by (then) &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Lieutenant General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Peter%20W.%20Chiarelli\"&gt;Peter W. Chiarelli&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the &lt;a href=\"Multi-National%20Corps%20%E2%80%93%20Iraq\"&gt;Multi-National Corps \u2013 Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The reprimand effectively ended Steele's future chances of promotion in the army. The content of the reprimand has not been made public, but two anonymous defense department officials identified by \"The New York Times\" have said that the reprimand was \"for not reporting the deaths and other details of the raid.\"\nSteele also instigated the use of \"Kill Boards\" to track how many Iraqis each company in his battalion had killed, while one of Steele's battalion commanders, Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Johnson, Jr. has written that \"Colonel Steele constantly articulated his judgment and displeasure that my battalion was not being aggressive enough toward the insurgents.\""
