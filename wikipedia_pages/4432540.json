    "text": "Marcelo dos Santos (born 17 May 1975), known as Marcelinho Para\u00edba or simply Marcelinho, is a Brazilian former professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; who played as an &lt;a href=\"attacking%20midfielder\"&gt;attacking midfielder&lt;/a&gt;, and was most recently the manager of &lt;a href=\"Treze%20Futebol%20Clube\"&gt;Treze&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Brazil, he is also known as Marcelinho \"Para\u00edba\", which refers to the state in which he was born, as a means to distinguish himself from &lt;a href=\"Marcelinho%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;other players also called \"Marcelinho\"&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the best &lt;a href=\"playmakers\"&gt;playmakers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; because of his extravagant skills that include his visionary passing, abundance of tricks, and his world-class technique.\nCareer.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Campina%20Grande\"&gt;Campina Grande&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Para%C3%ADba\"&gt;Para\u00edba&lt;/a&gt;, Marcelinho Para\u00edba began his career in &lt;a href=\"Campinense%20Clube\"&gt;Campinense&lt;/a&gt;, where he won two league titles there. Between 1994 and 1995, he played for &lt;a href=\"Santos%20FC\"&gt;Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later, however, he made his breakthrough at &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20FC\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, where he won two Paulist\u00f5es before being sold to &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20de%20Marseille\"&gt;Olympique de Marseille&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe only spent a year in France, and in 2001 he returned to Brazil to play for &lt;a href=\"Gr%C3%AAmio%20Foot-Ball%20Porto%20Alegrense\"&gt;Gr\u00eamio&lt;/a&gt;, where he began to experience the pinnacle of his career. At that time, Marcelinho Paraiba was called \"Marcelinho Para\u00facho\" by Gremistas, because of his passage in the team. He became champion and top scorer of the Campeonato Ga\u00facho, and champion of the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20do%20Brasil\"&gt;Copa do Brasil&lt;/a&gt;, where he scored a goal in the second game in the final against Corinthians, but did not play in the league that year because before the tournament, he signed a five-year contract with &lt;a href=\"Hertha%20BSC\"&gt;Hertha BSC&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarcelinho played for Hertha from 2001 to 2006. He is ranked among the most important players in the association's history and there Marcelinho was known as a technically talented player, serving as a &lt;a href=\"playmaker\"&gt;playmaker&lt;/a&gt; and leader while performing in both the midfield and forward area. In addition, he carried the responsibility of executing the &lt;a href=\"Direct%20free%20kick\"&gt;free kicks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"corner%20kick\"&gt;corner kick&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty kick&lt;/a&gt;s of the club. The personal trademarks of this extravagant football player are his usually remarkable shoes and his often multicolored hair. He was capped fives times for the &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil national football team&lt;/a&gt;, for which he scored once. At the beginning of the 2006\u201307 season, he arbitrarily extended his off-season vacation by nine days, which led to some slight tension with the Hertha association management. After Marcelinho had expressed himself, in the following the days, contradictory statements as to whether he wanted to remain at Hertha or not, he ended his term with them, signing a three-year contract with &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Trabzonspor\"&gt;Trabzonspor&lt;/a&gt; for approximately 2.5 million &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn August 2008, Marcelinho Para\u00edba returned to Brazil to play for &lt;a href=\"Clube%20de%20Regatas%20do%20Flamengo\"&gt;Flamengo&lt;/a&gt;. On 6 March 2009, &lt;a href=\"Coritiba%20Foot%20Ball%20Club\"&gt;Coritiba&lt;/a&gt; signed the forward on a free transfer until the end of the year, as Marcelinho terminated his contract with Flamengo. After the relegation of Coritiba, he re-signed for S\u00e3o Paulo on 18 December 2009. On 9 August 2010, he was loaned to &lt;a href=\"Sport%20Club%20do%20Recife\"&gt;Sport&lt;/a&gt; till the end of the 2010 season and his contract was extended to the end of the 2011 season.\nMarcelinho subsequently represented Sport, &lt;a href=\"Boa%20Esporte%20Clube\"&gt;Boa Esporte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fortaleza%20Esporte%20Clube\"&gt;Fortaleza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esporte%20Clube%20Internacional%20%28SC%29\"&gt;Internacional de Lages&lt;/a&gt; (two stints), &lt;a href=\"Joinville%20Esporte%20Clube\"&gt;Joinville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oeste%20Futebol%20Clube\"&gt;Oeste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ypiranga%20Futebol%20Clube\"&gt;Ypiranga de Erechim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Treze%20Futebol%20Clube\"&gt;Treze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Associa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Portuguesa%20de%20Desportos\"&gt;Portuguesa&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetirement and return.\nOn 15 March 2020, he announced his retirement as a professional player, playing for &lt;a href=\"Associa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Desportiva%20Perilima\"&gt;Perilima&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Centro%20Sportivo%20Paraibano\"&gt;Centro Sportivo Paraibano&lt;/a&gt; in the eighth round of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Campeonato%20Paraibano\"&gt;2020 Campeonato Paraibano&lt;/a&gt;; however, eight months later, he changed his mind and rejoined Treze in an effort to help them avoid relegation. He made his first appearance since returning from retirement on 28 November as a half-time substitute in a 1\u20131 draw with &lt;a href=\"Vila%20Nova%20Futebol%20Clube\"&gt;Vila Nova&lt;/a&gt;, being substituted himself in the 78th minute.\nManagerial career.\nOn 10 December 2020, after Treze suffered relegation from the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20C\"&gt;2020 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C&lt;/a&gt;, Marcelinho was appointed manager of the club for the 2021 campaign. Despite a promising start in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Copa%20do%20Nordeste\"&gt;2021 Copa do Nordeste&lt;/a&gt;, he couldn't arrest a drop in performance which saw his side finish fourth in the first stage of the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Campeoanato%20Paraibano\"&gt;2021 Campeoanato Paraibano&lt;/a&gt;, and on 24 May 2021 he was dismissed.\nHonours.\nClub.\nCampinense\nS\u00e3o Paulo\nGr\u00eamio\nHertha BSC\nBoa Esporte"
