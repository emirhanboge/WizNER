Nicknamed \"The Lang\", \"Camby\" or \"The Wee Gers\", were formed in 1899, they play at Somervell Park and wear blue strips (uniforms).\nThey will play in the &lt;a href=\"West%20of%20Scotland%20Football%20League\"&gt;West of Scotland Football League&lt;/a&gt; Conference B from season &lt;a href=\"2021%E2%80%9322%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;2021\u201322&lt;/a&gt; after moving from the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association%2C%20West%20Region\"&gt;West Region&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Scottish Junior Football Association&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. They were awarded the title of 'Scottish Junior team of the 20th century' by the SJFA due to the honours they won in the 1970s.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years (1891\u20131933).\nOriginally named Leeside FC (founded in 1891) and joining the junior ranks in 1892. The club were later renamed, Clyde Rovers in 1896 before merging with Cambuslang Rovers and another Cambuslang based side, Halfway FC in 1899.\u00a0In their first year The club shared grounds with the now defunct &lt;a href=\"Cambuslang%20F.C.\"&gt;Cambuslang FC&lt;/a&gt;. Following Cambuslang FC's demise in 1897, Rovers took control of Bogshole Park, later to be renamed Mains Park which would be retained following the merger. Cambuslang Rangers FC would also play matches at Westburn Park where &lt;a href=\"Cambuslang%20Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Cambuslang Hibernian&lt;/a&gt; were previously situated.\nIn 1904 Cambuslang Rangers moved to their new home ground, Somervell Park, which has remained their home since.\nIn the 1910\u201311 season, Cambuslang Rangers achieved their first successes by winning the &lt;a href=\"Glasgow%20Junior%20League\"&gt;Glasgow Junior League&lt;/a&gt; and Glasgow Junior Cup double. That would kick off the club's first spell of success as they went on to win the league in 1911\u201312, 1914\u201315 and 1915\u201316 before the Glasgow Junior League dissolved in 1927. The Lang would also win the Glasgow Junior Cup three more times (in 1920\u201321, 1926\u201327 and 1932\u201333 respectively) during this period.\nFirst Scottish Junior Cup (1933\u201359).\nThe club would win their first &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt; in the 1937\u201338 season. They had previously reached the final twice before, finishing runners up in 1919\u201320 &amp; 1926\u201327. This time though it would be Cambuslang who would lift the trophy after two goals from Taylor and another from McGhie secured a 3\u20132 win over &lt;a href=\"Benburb%20F.C.\"&gt;Benburb FC&lt;/a&gt; in front of a crowd of 28,000.\nThe Glasgow Junior Cup was lifted once again in the 1946\u201347 season.\nDominance (1959\u20131974).\nThe 1959\u201360 season would set the foundations for a spell of dominance in the Junior game as Cambuslang Rangers beat &lt;a href=\"Thorniewood%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Thorniewood United&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20130 to win the &lt;a href=\"West%20of%20Scotland%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;West Of Scotland Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;1960\u201361 season&lt;/a&gt;, Cambuslang lost in the finals of five different competitions, including the West of Scotland Cup and the Scottish Junior Cup.\nThe club would again lift the Glasgow Junior Cup in 1963\u201364, doing the same again in two consecutive seasons between 1965 and 1967 before the club achieved four more &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt; triumphs in the space of just six years. The first of these ended a 31-year wait, having lost in three previous finals during that time (1944\u201345, 1960\u201361 and 1963\u201364). Cambuslang Rangers would face &lt;a href=\"Kirkintilloch%20Rob%20Roy%20F.C.\"&gt;Kirkintilloch Rob Roy&lt;/a&gt; in the 1968\u201369 final, with a single goal from &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Nelson%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Keith Nelson&lt;/a&gt; being enough to separate the sides and give Cambuslang their second Scottish Junior Cup. This achievement proceeded two consecutive Central League Cups (in 1968\u201369 and 1969\u201370), four &lt;a href=\"Central%20Junior%20Football%20League\"&gt;Central League&lt;/a&gt; titles in a row (1970 to 1974) and the Central Sectional League Cup in the 1970\u201371 season.\nThere was also three further Scottish Junior Cups won between 1970 and 1974 taking the club's tally to five. The club would beat &lt;a href=\"Newtongrange%20Star%20F.C.\"&gt;Newtongrange Star&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 in 1971 before repeating the achievement, this time overcoming &lt;a href=\"Bonnyrigg%20Rose%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Bonnyrigg Rose&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20132 after goals from Cummings, McCallum and Brown. Cambuslang's string of trophies only split by a single defeat in the 1972\u201373 final second replay by the hands of &lt;a href=\"Irvine%20Meadow%20F.C.\"&gt;Irvine Meadow&lt;/a&gt;, losing by 1\u20130 after the previous two matches were drawn 2\u20132 and 3\u20133. However, despite the setback Cambuslang Rangers completed the Junior Cup dominance in the following season, defeating &lt;a href=\"Linlithgow%20Rose%20F.C.\"&gt;Linlithgow Rose&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131 with Cummings again getting on the scoresheet twice and Morrison also bagging a goal to complete The Lang's Scottish Junior Cup triumphs to date.\nThe dormant years (1975\u20131999).\nCambuslang struggled to replicate their achievements and it took over ten years for them to win another trophy. In 1986 the club won the Central District First Division title, and managed to repeat this in the 1989\u201390 and 1990\u201391 seasons \u2013 that 1990\u201391 side also won the Evening Times Cup Winners Cup making it a double for that season.\nMillennial era (2000\u20132018).\nDespite winning the Central Sectional League Cup again in the 2000\u201301 season Cambuslang Rangers again continued to struggle in terms of success during the 2000s.\nAs the 2010s began a spell of success seemed to be returning after the club's &lt;a href=\"West%20of%20Scotland%20League%20Central%20District%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Central District Second Division&lt;/a&gt; league win in 2013 was later followed by a Glasgow Junior Cup in the 2015\u201316 campaign under the leadership of former player Paul McColl.\nUnder McColl's management, Cambuslang Rangers would continue to succeed on the park as they won back-to-back promotions in the 2016\u201317 and 2017\u201318 seasons before he left his position in January 2019.\nFinancial difficulties and re-emergence (2019\u2013Present).\nWhilst all was seemingly going well on the park behind the scenes, Cambuslang Rangers had financial difficulties which culminated in the club being on the verge of extinction at the end of 2018. This led to the club having to let go of most of their players, with only two opting to stay, and committee members resigning from their positions.\nIn January 2019, local businessman David Kerr stepped up and took charge of the club. Following the departure of McColl, the club would have to appoint a new manager and draft in players to see out the 2018\u201319 season.\nAfter successfully completing the season, the club introduced an academy set-up with the aim to develop local young players for the first team with age groups ranging from 'Camby Cubs' to U21s. In May 2020, the club announced that under-21 players Scott Williamson and Campbell Gray would be the first players in the club's history to graduate from the youth academy to the first team. The club also announced that Billy Campbell and Paul McColl would be co-managers for the 2020\u201321 campaign.\nIn August 2020 Chairman David Kerr stepped down from his post, leaving the club in a much healthier state than when he took over. Club Secretary Gordon Dinnie has stepped up into the vacant role that had been left by Kerr's departure. \nIn October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic the committee made the decision to pull the club from all league action.\nCrest and colours.\nThe Cambuslang Rangers club crest is an initialisation of the club's name with the letters C.R.F.C. interweaved inside the crest.\nIn the 1990s the club name and established year were added around the crest and have remained there to avoid confusion with the &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers FC&lt;/a&gt; crest.\nIn November 2021, Cambuslang Rangers launched their new brand marks as well as a new club crest which sported a prominent circle shape to signify a unity between the club and community.\nWhen all of the Cambuslang clubs merged the Cambuslang Rovers traditional blue shirts would be retained and &lt;a href=\"Cambuslang%20Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Cambuslang Hibernian's&lt;/a&gt; blue shorts &amp; socks would add to it with only the green shirt being dropped from the strip.\nToday the club still play in an all royal blue strip although traditionally, throughout the 20th century they mainly wore royal blue shirts, white shorts &amp; white socks. The club have also known to play in yellow or white shirts with blue shorts &amp; socks during the late '60s &amp; early '70s however these strips were mainly wore to avoid clashing with opposition colours. In recent times Cambuslang have been known to wear a change kit colour of red.\nInfluential players.\nWhile most of the 1970s players are held in high regard such as Bobby Brown, &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Nelson%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Keith Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, John Cummings, Billy Patterson &amp; more, supporters tend to consider Willie McCallum as the club's best-ever player. He was a mainstay and major asset to the club in the 1970s &amp; was often asked for his autograph which is very rare for players at junior level.\nCurrent squad.\n (Currently on loan from Albion Rovers)\n (Currently on loan at Larkhall Thistle)\n (Currently on loan at Larkhall Thistle)\nCommittee.\nThe current committee are involved in the upkeep of all aspects of the club from stadium developments to sponsorships.\nSince 2019 the committee has overseen the introduction of the academy, the singing section of the Somervell Boys and the recent upgrades to the stadium in partnership with Legends Bar &amp; Grill.\n2021 will see some changes within the dressing rooms. The addition of the Loft Lounge, which is currently under construction and the introduction of our Under 20 Development Squad.\nSupporters.\nCambuslang Rangers attracted big crowds through most of the 20th century with as many as tens of thousands attending each week to see the club compete. These supporters were mainly local employees at the neighbouring local business, Hoover. However since Hoover's liquidation the crowds have been impacted at Somervell Park.\nIn more recent times the club typically have attendances of around 200 per home game.\nIn October 2019 the club set up a singing section known as the Somervell Boys which contains mainly local youths who bring noise to matches and was described by the club as a group which \"generate a positive and colourful atmosphere\" for the club.\nCambuslang Rangers have been playing matches at their home ground of Somervell Park since 1904 and have a record attendance of 13,500.\nClub anthem.\nSince 2019 the club have adopted the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20City%20Rollers\"&gt;Bay City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; classic \"Shang-A-Lang\" as their club anthem due to the title reflecting their nickname 'The Lang'.\nRivalries.\nCambuslang Rangers main rivalry is with their geographic neighbours, &lt;a href=\"Rutherglen%20Glencairn%20F.C.\"&gt;Rutherglen Glencairn&lt;/a&gt; which has existed since the early days of Cambuslang Rangers merging and has continued to this day as the club's main local rivals.\nHonours.\nLeagues.\nCentral League First Division: 1985\u201386, 1989\u201390, 1990\u201391"
