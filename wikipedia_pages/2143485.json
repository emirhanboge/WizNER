    "text": "Canudos is a municipality in the northeast region of Bahia, Brazil. The original town, since flooded by the &lt;a href=\"Cocorob%C3%B3%20Dam\"&gt;Cocorob\u00f3 Dam&lt;/a&gt;, was the scene of violent clashes between peasants and republican police in the 1890s.\nThe municipality contains part of the &lt;a href=\"Raso%20da%20Catarina\"&gt;Raso da Catarina&lt;/a&gt; ecoregion.\nHistory.\nThe town of Canudos was founded in the racially diverse &lt;a href=\"Bahia\"&gt;Bahia&lt;/a&gt; state of northeastern &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; in 1893 by Ant\u00f4nio Vicente Mendes Maciel, an itinerant &lt;a href=\"preacher\"&gt;preacher&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ceara\"&gt;Ceara&lt;/a&gt;. Mendes Maciel had been wandering through the backroads and lesser-inhabited areas of the country from the 1870s onwards, followed by a band of loyal supporters. As his following swelled, he took on the name &lt;a href=\"Ant%C3%B4nio%20Conselheiro\"&gt;Ant\u00f4nio Conselheiro&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ant\u00f4nio the Counselor\") and increasingly began to trouble the local authorities, who saw him as a Monarchist and thus a threat to their legitimacy.\nSettlement.\nIn 1893, following a protest over &lt;a href=\"taxation\"&gt;taxation&lt;/a&gt; and a violent melee with the police forces in Masset\u00e9, Conselheiro and his band settled on an abandoned farm called Canudos, so called because a plant, \"canudo-de-pita\" (scientific name \"&lt;a href=\"Ipomoea%20carnea\"&gt;Ipomoea carnea&lt;/a&gt;\", its popular name referring to its hollow tubes, used for manufacturing smoking pipes) was common in the region. The place was named \"Belo Monte\" (Beautiful Mount) by Antonio Conselheiro, but the old name, \"Arraial de Canudos\", prevailed. Over the years people from across Bahia, including landless &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s, former &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20people%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;indigenous people&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canga%C3%A7o\"&gt;\"cangaceiros\"&lt;/a&gt; flocked to join him, and within a few years the fledgling settlement numbered 30,000 people (which made it the second largest urban center in Bahia behind Salvador) and had developed a leather exporting business.\nAs a community, Canudos operated somewhat like a religious commune, with Ant\u00f4nio Conselheiro as the principal member and director. Canudos was a heavily religious settlement, under the sway of Antonio's fanaticism, but despite his fanaticism he did not assume any official position of authority. The settlement practiced common ownership, abolished the official currency, negated Brazilian national laws and participated collectively in the management of the town. Canudos was in essence a reaction against the contemporary Brazilian nation.\nNeither the local nor national government supported the settlement in Canudos. The local government of Bahia felt pressure from landowners to take action against the settlement because of labor shortages caused by migration. The Brazilian national government wanted a military expedition sent to destroy Canudos in the name of liberalism and progress. In the words of one historian, \"The mere existence of autonomous movements not subject to state control was antithetical to the national interest. Canudos stood for such autonomy, and therefore had to be destroyed.\"\nSuppression of the Community.\nThe first three invasions were amply defeated by the villagers. However, in 1897, a considerably larger fourth invasion force managed to overwhelm the village. Their success was in part helped by the death, from &lt;a href=\"dysentery\"&gt;dysentery&lt;/a&gt;, of Ant\u00f4nio Conselheiro, during the early stages of the &lt;a href=\"siege\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Brazilian army&lt;/a&gt; showed no mercy, brutally massacring the survivors and destroying the entire village. An academician, Alvim Horcades, would thus describe the massacre:\n\"Eu vi e assisti a sacrificar-se todos aqueles miser\u00e1veis (...) e com sinceridade o digo: em Canudos foram degolados quase todos os prisioneiros (...) Arrancar-se a vida a uma criancinha (...) \u00e9 o maior dos barbarismos e dos crimes que o homem pode praticar.\" (\"I saw and witnessed the sacrifice of all those poor people (...) and I say with all sincerity: in Canudos almost all the prisoners were beheaded (...) To take the life of a little child (...) is the greatest of cruelties and crimes man can commit.\")\nPost-War Canudos.\nToday the area is submerged by water, the result of the &lt;a href=\"Cocorob%C3%B3%20Dam\"&gt;Cocorob\u00f3 Dam&lt;/a&gt; project in the 1970s, which blocked the &lt;a href=\"Vaza-Barris%20River\"&gt;Vaza-Barris River&lt;/a&gt; and flooded the old city. At low water the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"church%20%28building%29\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; that was once the village's centrepiece can occasionally be seen. Once a year, in October, a &lt;a href=\"mass%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; is held to commemorate those lost in what is known today as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Canudos\"&gt;War of Canudos&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"municipality\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; of Nova Canudos was built nearby, at &lt;a href=\"latitude\"&gt;latitude&lt;/a&gt; 09\u00ba53'48\" South and &lt;a href=\"longitude\"&gt;longitude&lt;/a&gt; 39\u00ba01'35\" West, and currently has around 13,000 inhabitants.\nThe story of Canudos was told by &lt;a href=\"war%20correspondent\"&gt;war correspondent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Euclides%20da%20Cunha\"&gt;Euclides da Cunha&lt;/a&gt; in the book \"&lt;a href=\"Os%20Sert%C3%B5es\"&gt;Os Sert\u00f5es&lt;/a&gt;\" (1901; translated into English as \"Rebellion in the Backlands\", 1944), which helped inspire and provide material for the novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20War%20of%20the%20End%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;The War of the End of the World&lt;/a&gt;\" by Peruvian Nobel Laureate &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Vargas%20Llosa\"&gt;Mario Vargas Llosa&lt;/a&gt; (1981). The conflict was also described at length by Peter Robb in \"A Death in Brazil\" (2004). In fictional form it appears in the novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Garment\"&gt;The First Garment&lt;/a&gt;\" (1975) by a &lt;a href=\"Georgians\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt; writer &lt;a href=\"Guram%20Dochanashvili\"&gt;Guram Dochanashvili&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe municipality contains the &lt;a href=\"Canudos%20State%20Park\"&gt;Canudos State Park&lt;/a&gt;, created in 1986 to commemorate the War of Canudos."
