    "text": "Cambridge City Airport , previously Marshall Airport Cambridge UK, is a regional airport in &lt;a href=\"Cambridgeshire\"&gt;Cambridgeshire&lt;/a&gt;, England. It is located on the eastern outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"Newmarket%20Road%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Newmarket Road&lt;/a&gt; and west of the village of &lt;a href=\"Teversham\"&gt;Teversham&lt;/a&gt;, from the centre of Cambridge and approximately from London.\nMarshall of Cambridge Aerospace Limited has a &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Civil%20Aviation%20Authority\"&gt;CAA&lt;/a&gt; Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P433) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. The airport is available for corporate and private use, and is home to four flying schools.\n, there are no publicly accessible scheduled flights from the airport.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nOpened in 1938, when it replaced the old airfield at &lt;a href=\"Fen%20Ditton\"&gt;Fen Ditton&lt;/a&gt;, the airport is owned and operated by &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Aerospace\"&gt;Marshall Aerospace&lt;/a&gt;, a Cambridge-based company with many years' history servicing &lt;a href=\"civilian\"&gt;civilian&lt;/a&gt; and military contracts. The main building, which is a Grade II &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt;, was designed by the architect &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Tomlinson\"&gt;Harold Tomlinson&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Cambridge and constructed in 1936\u201337. For many years it was the base for the &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20University%20Air%20Squadron\"&gt;Cambridge University Air Squadron&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment since the 2000s.\nIn 2000, a proposal was created to relocate the airport to a new site away from the city, which would have freed up of land for the building of several thousand new homes. A study for a new airport was undertaken by &lt;a href=\"Cambridgeshire\"&gt;Cambridgeshire&lt;/a&gt; County Council and &lt;a href=\"planning%20permission\"&gt;planning permission&lt;/a&gt; was requested but withdrawn. In April 2010 Marshall Aerospace again announced it would not be moving from Cambridge Airport to make way for new housing. &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Mildenhall\"&gt;RAF Mildenhall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Waterbeach%20Barracks\"&gt;Waterbeach Barracks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Wyton\"&gt;RAF Wyton&lt;/a&gt; were considered as alternative sites but Marshall concluded there were \"no suitable relocation options\".\nIn October 2008, to coincide with the opening of the new Marshall Business Aviation Centre, the airport's name was changed from Cambridge City Airport to Marshall Airport Cambridge UK. The name was changed again to Cambridge Airport in 2011 as plans were announced for an expansion of the airport following the installation of instrument landing systems and new hangars.\nIn 2012 the airport introduced charter flights to Italy as well as regular flights to the Channel Islands. These were the first scheduled flights from the airport since 2006. In mid 2013 the airport completed a \u00a31m refurbishment of its passenger terminal to handle new international airline services and in March 2015 &lt;a href=\"British%20Airways\"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; commenced daily scheduled services to &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; operated by franchise &lt;a href=\"Sun-Air%20of%20Scandinavia\"&gt;Sun-Air of Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;. Using 32 seat Dornier 328JET aircraft, to begin with 20 seats were reserved by AstraZeneca in order to connect its two main European offices.\nPassenger services were reported as \"to end on 31 January 2016\", although British Airways/Sun-Air continued temporarily to operate flights from Cambridge to Gothenburg. Since 24 March 2016 tickets have not been available to the general public. As of November 2017 the flights now originate in Manchester with a brief stop in Cambridge.\nIn November 2019 the local &lt;a href=\"Fixed-base%20operator\"&gt;FBO&lt;/a&gt; changed hands from &lt;a href=\"ExecuJet%20Aviation%20Group\"&gt;ExecuJet&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20Jet%20Centre\"&gt;Cambridge Jet Centre&lt;/a&gt; which is managed by the Airport directly.\nProspective closure.\nIn May 2019, &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Aerospace%20and%20Defence%20Group\"&gt;Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group&lt;/a&gt;, owners of the airport, announced that the airport would be closed to all traffic by 2030 at the latest. The Group plans to redevelop the airport site for around 12,000 homes and of business premises. , the Group was deciding between three potential airfields for its continuing operations: &lt;a href=\"Duxford%20Aerodrome\"&gt;Duxford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Wyton\"&gt;Wyton&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridgeshire, and &lt;a href=\"Cranfield%20Airport\"&gt;Cranfield&lt;/a&gt; in Bedfordshire. In January 2020, the Group ruled out moving to &lt;a href=\"Duxford%20Aerodrome\"&gt;Duxford&lt;/a&gt; due to incompatibility between the defence requirements of the Group and the requirements of the local traffic. On 6 October 2020, &lt;a href=\"Cranfield%20University\"&gt;Cranfield University&lt;/a&gt; and MADG announced that they had signed an option agreement for the potential relocation of Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group (MADG) to &lt;a href=\"Cranfield%20Airport\"&gt;Cranfield Airport&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesperson for MADG cautioned that \"it is important to note that the signing of the option agreement does not represent a final decision\".\nAirlines and destinations.\n, there are no destinations for which members of the general public can buy a ticket."
