    "text": "Ilija Dimoski (, born 27 June 1939) is a &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Macedonia\"&gt;Macedonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; manager and former player. He is nicknamed \"Majstorot\".\nHe played a total of 790 games, 249 with &lt;a href=\"FK%20Pobeda\"&gt;FK Pobeda&lt;/a&gt; and 541 with &lt;a href=\"FK%20Radni%C4%8Dki%20Ni%C5%A1\"&gt;FK Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161&lt;/a&gt;, and despite being a full-back, he scored 74 goals, 17 for Pobeda and 57 for Radni\u010dki. He was an offensive full-back who very often participated in the attack, something of an avangard for the football of the 1960s and 1970s. He was also the main penalty-shoot taker in the clubs he played, rarely missing. However, he also entered in the history of Yugoslav football because of the high number of own-goals he scored, 8, one with Pobeda and seven with Radni\u010dki. He was also well known by his strong shots, which he usually executed with the out side of the foot. He was known as a right full-back, however, during his 13-years long career with Radni\u010dki he occasionally played in every position except as goalkeeper, but in 1957 on one acasion he even played as goalkeeper, while he was still playing with Pobeda.\nPlaying career.\nClub.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Prilep\"&gt;Prilep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vardarska%20banovina\"&gt;Vardarska banovina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, he played as right full-back with local side &lt;a href=\"FK%20Pobeda\"&gt;FK Pobeda&lt;/a&gt; between 1957 and 1961. When he started playing Pobeda was playing in third level, but in 1959 they got promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Second%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav Second League&lt;/a&gt;. In 1961 he was signed by Serbian side &lt;a href=\"FK%20Radni%C4%8Dki%20Ni%C5%A1\"&gt;FK Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161&lt;/a&gt; which were rivals of Pobeda in the league. However, Dimovski will play with Radni\u010dki only one more season in Yugslav second level, since Radni\u010dki was an ambitious team and achieved promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav First League&lt;/a&gt; after just one season since Dimovski joined the club. It was the start of a major rise of Radni\u010dki and the beginning of a period of over two decades in which Radni\u010dki became among the most stable Yugoslav clubs. Dimovski became a fulcral player of this generation and stayed in the club 13 years. When he finished his spell with Radni\u010dki in 1974, the club direction nominated him as the main coach, however only three days later \u0110or\u0111e Ka\u010dunkovi\u0107 replaced him, and so Dimovski entered Yugoslav football history as the coach with the shortest spell in a club. In 1974, he had a short spell with lower-level side &lt;a href=\"FK%20Proleter%20Novi%20Sad\"&gt;FK Proleter Novi Sad&lt;/a&gt;.\nManagerial career.\nAfter retiring, Dimovski became a coach. He became assistant manager of Ku\u010dunkovi\u0107 at Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161, and help the club win its first major international trophy, the 1974 &lt;a href=\"Balkans%20Cup\"&gt;Balkans Cup&lt;/a&gt;. He will later lead Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 as main coach to their maximal achievement in Europe, taking them to the semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"1981%E2%80%9382%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1981\u201382 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. After coaching Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161, he coached &lt;a href=\"FK%20Vardar\"&gt;FK Vardar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FK%20Pobeda\"&gt;FK Pobeda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FK%20Pelister\"&gt;FK Pelister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FK%20Osogovo\"&gt;FK Osogovo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FK%20Rabotni%C4%8Dki\"&gt;FK Rabotni\u010dki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FK%20Napredok\"&gt;FK Napredok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FK%20Bregalnica%20Del%C4%8Devo\"&gt;FK Bregalnica Del\u010devo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FK%20Pri%C5%A1tina\"&gt;FK Pri\u0161tina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FK%20Radni%C4%8Dki%20Pirot\"&gt;FK Radni\u010dki Pirot&lt;/a&gt;, etc. He also coached in Australia, &lt;a href=\"Footscray%20JUST\"&gt;Footscray JUST&lt;/a&gt; in 1989."
