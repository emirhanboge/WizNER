Over her four-decade career, she has developed an &lt;a href=\"Eclecticism%20in%20music\"&gt;eclectic&lt;/a&gt; musical style that draws on influences and genres including &lt;a href=\"electronic%20music\"&gt;electronic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Experimental%20music\"&gt;experimental&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trip%20hop\"&gt;trip hop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alternative%20rock\"&gt;alternative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Classical%20music\"&gt;classical&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"avant-garde%20music\"&gt;avant-garde&lt;/a&gt; music.\nBorn and raised in &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;, Bj\u00f6rk began her music career at the age of 11 and gained international recognition as the lead singer of the &lt;a href=\"alternative%20rock\"&gt;alternative rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"the%20Sugarcubes\"&gt;the Sugarcubes&lt;/a&gt;. After the band's breakup in 1992, Bj\u00f6rk embarked on a solo career, coming to prominence with albums such as \"&lt;a href=\"Debut%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Debut&lt;/a&gt;\" (1993), \"&lt;a href=\"Post%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;\" (1995), and \"&lt;a href=\"Homogenic\"&gt;Homogenic&lt;/a&gt;\" (1997), while collaborating with a range of artists and exploring a variety of multimedia projects.

In 2015, \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;\" named her one of the &lt;a href=\"Time%20100\"&gt;100 most influential people in the world&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" named her the 60th greatest singer and the 81st &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone%27s%20100%20Greatest%20Songwriters%20of%20All%20Time\"&gt;greatest songwriter&lt;/a&gt;.\nBj\u00f6rk starred in the 2000 &lt;a href=\"Lars%20von%20Trier\"&gt;Lars von Trier&lt;/a&gt; film \"&lt;a href=\"Dancer%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;Dancer in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;\", for which she won the Best Actress Award at the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;2000 Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, and was nominated for the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Song\"&gt;Academy Award for Best Original Song&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"I%27ve%20Seen%20It%20All\"&gt;I've Seen It All&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Biophilia\" was marketed as an interactive app album with its own education program. Bj\u00f6rk has also been an advocate for environmental causes in Iceland. A &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rk%20%28exhibition%29\"&gt;retrospective exhibition&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to Bj\u00f6rk was held at the New York &lt;a href=\"MoMA\"&gt;Museum of Modern Art&lt;/a&gt; in 2015.\nLife and career.\n1965\u20131984: Early life and career beginnings.\nBj\u00f6rk was born on 21 November 1965 in &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;, where she grew up. Her mother was activist Hildur R\u00fana Hauksd\u00f3ttir (7 October 1946 \u2013 25 October 2018), who protested against the development of Iceland's &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A1rahnj%C3%BAkar%20Hydropower%20Plant\"&gt;K\u00e1rahnj\u00fakar Hydropower Plant&lt;/a&gt;. Her father is &lt;a href=\"Gu%C3%B0mundur%20Gunnarsson\"&gt;Gu\u00f0mundur Gunnarsson&lt;/a&gt;, a union leader and electrician. They divorced when Bj\u00f6rk was born and she moved with her mother to a &lt;a href=\"commune\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt;. Her stepfather is S\u00e6var \u00c1rnason, a former guitarist in the band Pops. At six, Bj\u00f6rk enrolled at Reykjav\u00edk school Barnam\u00fas\u00edksk\u00f3li, where she studied &lt;a href=\"piano%23History%20and%20musical%20performance\"&gt;classical piano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flute\"&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt;. After a school recital in which Bj\u00f6rk sang &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Charles%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Tina Charles&lt;/a&gt;'s 1976 hit \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Love%20to%20Love%20%28But%20My%20Baby%20Loves%20to%20Dance%29\"&gt;I Love to Love&lt;/a&gt;\", her teachers sent a recording of her singing the song to the &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A1s%201\"&gt;R\u00daV radio station&lt;/a&gt;, which was then Iceland's only radio station. The recording was nationally broadcast and, after hearing it, a representative of the &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A1lkinn\"&gt;F\u00e1lkinn&lt;/a&gt; record label offered Bj\u00f6rk a recording contract. Her d\u00e9but, \"&lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rk%20%28album%29\"&gt;Bj\u00f6rk&lt;/a&gt;\", was recorded when she was 11 years old and was released in Iceland in December 1977.\nDuring her teens, after the diffusion of &lt;a href=\"punk%20rock\"&gt;punk rock&lt;/a&gt; music in Iceland, Bj\u00f6rk formed the &lt;a href=\"All-female%20band%231970s\"&gt;all-girl punk band&lt;/a&gt; Spit and Snot. In 1980, she formed a &lt;a href=\"jazz%20fusion%231970s\"&gt;jazz fusion&lt;/a&gt; group, Exodus, collaborated in another group, JAM80, and graduated from music school. In 1982, she and bassist Jakob Magn\u00fasson formed another group, &lt;a href=\"Tappi%20T%C3%ADkarrass\"&gt;Tappi T\u00edkarrass&lt;/a&gt; (\"Cork the Bitch's Ass\" in &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20language\"&gt;Icelandic&lt;/a&gt;), and released &lt;a href=\"extended%20play\"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Biti%C3%B0%20fast%20%C3%AD%20viti%C3%B0\"&gt;Biti\u00f0 fast \u00ed viti\u00f0&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Bite Hard Into Hell\" in Icelandic), in August 1982. Their album \"&lt;a href=\"Miranda%20%28album%29\"&gt;Miranda&lt;/a&gt;\" was released in December 1983. The group was featured in the documentary \"&lt;a href=\"Rokk%20%C3%AD%20Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Rokk \u00ed Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;\", with Bj\u00f6rk being featured on the cover of the &lt;a href=\"VHS\"&gt;VHS&lt;/a&gt; release. Around this time, Bj\u00f6rk met guitarist \u00de\u00f3r Eldon and &lt;a href=\"surrealism\"&gt;surrealist&lt;/a&gt; group Medusa, which also included poet &lt;a href=\"Sj%C3%B3n\"&gt;Sj\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, with whom she started a lifelong collaboration and formed a group, Rokka Rokka Drum. She described her time as part of Medusa as \"a gorgeous D.I.Y. organic university: extreme fertility!\u201d\nBj\u00f6rk appeared as a featured artist on \"Afi\", a track from the Bj\u00f6rgvin G\u00edslason 1983 record \"\u00d6rugglega\".\nDue to the imminent discontinuance of radio show \"\u00c1fangar\", two radio personalities, \u00c1smundur J\u00f3nsson and Gu\u00f0ni R\u00fanar, requested musicians to play on a last &lt;a href=\"live%20radio\"&gt;live radio&lt;/a&gt; show. Bj\u00f6rk joined with Einar Melax (from the group Fan Houtens K\u00f3k\u00f3), &lt;a href=\"Einar%20%C3%96rn%20Benediktsson\"&gt;Einar \u00d6rn Benediktsson&lt;/a&gt; (from Purrkur Pillnikk), &lt;a href=\"Gu%C3%B0laugur%20Kristinn%20%C3%93ttarsson\"&gt;Gu\u00f0laugur Kristinn \u00d3ttarsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sigtryggur%20Baldursson\"&gt;Sigtryggur Baldursson&lt;/a&gt; (from \u00deeyr), and Birgir Mogensen (from Spilaf\u00edfl) to perform in the concert. The group developed a &lt;a href=\"gothic%20rock\"&gt;gothic rock&lt;/a&gt; sound. During this experience, Bj\u00f6rk began to develop her vocalisation \u2013 punctuated by howls and shrieks. The project performed as Gott kv\u00f6ld during the concert. When they later decided to keep playing together as a group, they used the name (\"&lt;a href=\"Witchcraft\"&gt;Sorcery&lt;/a&gt;\" in Icelandic). Bj\u00f6rk's acquaintance gave the group their studio to record in and released their first single in 1983. Their first big performance at a festival in Iceland was headlined by English &lt;a href=\"anarchism\"&gt;anarchist&lt;/a&gt; punk band &lt;a href=\"Crass\"&gt;Crass&lt;/a&gt;, whose record label, &lt;a href=\"Crass%20Records\"&gt;Crass Records&lt;/a&gt; offered the band a record deal. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20%28KUKL%20album%29\"&gt;The Eye&lt;/a&gt;\" was released in 1984, followed by a two-month tour in Europe, which also included a performance at &lt;a href=\"Roskilde%20Festival\"&gt;Roskilde Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Denmark. This made Kukl the first Icelandic band to play at the festival. During this period Bj\u00f6rk published a hand-coloured book of poems. \"&lt;a href=\"Um%20%C3%9Arnat%20fr%C3%A1%20Bj%C3%B6rk\"&gt;Um \u00darnat fr\u00e1 Bj\u00f6rk&lt;/a&gt;\" was distributed in 1984.\n1985\u20131992: The Sugarcubes, marriage and motherhood.\nKukl's second album, \"&lt;a href=\"Holidays%20in%20Europe%20%28The%20Naughty%20Nought%29\"&gt;Holidays in Europe (The Naughty Nought)&lt;/a&gt;\", came out in 1986. The band split up due to personal conflict, with Bj\u00f6rk keeping a collaboration with Gu\u00f0laugur, which was named &lt;a href=\"the%20Elgar%20Sisters\"&gt;the Elgar Sisters&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the songs they recorded ended up as B-sides to Bj\u00f6rk solo singles.\nBj\u00f6rk had her first acting role on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Juniper%20Tree%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Juniper Tree&lt;/a&gt;\" (filmed in 1986, released in 1990), a tale of &lt;a href=\"witchcraft\"&gt;witchcraft&lt;/a&gt; based on the &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20Grimm\"&gt;Brothers Grimm&lt;/a&gt; story, directed by &lt;a href=\"Nietzchka%20Keene\"&gt;Nietzchka Keene&lt;/a&gt;. Bj\u00f6rk played the role of Margit, a girl whose mother has been killed for practising witchcraft. That summer, former band member Einar \u00d6rn and Eldon formed the arts collective \"&lt;a href=\"Bad%20Taste%20%28record%20label%29\"&gt;Smekkleysa&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Bad Taste\" in Icelandic), created with the intention of being both a record label and book publishing company. Various friends, namely Melax and Sigtryggur from Kukl, along with &lt;a href=\"Bragi%20%C3%93lafsson\"&gt;Bragi \u00d3lafsson&lt;/a&gt; and Fri\u00f0rik Erlingson from Purrkur Pillnikk, joined the group and a band coalesced in the collective solely to make money. They were initially called \u00deukl, but they were advertised as Kukl (the name of the previous band). At a later concert supporting Icelandic band Stu\u00f0menn, they referred to themselves as \"Sykurmolarnir\" (\"Sugarcubes\" in Icelandic). Their first double A-side single \"Einn mol'\u00e1 mann\", which contained the songs \"&lt;a href=\"Birthday%20%28The%20Sugarcubes%20song%29\"&gt;Amm\u00e6li&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Birthday\") and \"K\u00f6ttur\" (\"Cat\"), was released on 21 November 1986, Bj\u00f6rk's 21st birthday. At the end of that year, the band was signed by &lt;a href=\"One%20Little%20Indian\"&gt;One Little Indian&lt;/a&gt;. Their first English single, \"Birthday\", was released in the United Kingdom on 17 August 1987; a week later, it was declared single of the week by \"&lt;a href=\"Melody%20Maker\"&gt;Melody Maker&lt;/a&gt;\". The Sugarcubes also signed a distribution deal with &lt;a href=\"Elektra%20Records\"&gt;Elektra Records&lt;/a&gt; in the United States and recorded their first album, \"&lt;a href=\"Life%27s%20Too%20Good\"&gt;Life's Too Good&lt;/a&gt;\", which was released in 1988. After the release of the album, Eldon and Bj\u00f6rk divorced soon after the birth of their child despite being in the same group. The album went on to sell more than one million copies worldwide. Bj\u00f6rk contributed as a background vocalist on 1987 album \"&lt;a href=\"Loftmynd\"&gt;Loftmynd&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Megas\"&gt;Megas&lt;/a&gt;, for whom she provided background vocals also on his subsequent album \"&lt;a href=\"H%C3%B6fu%C3%B0lausnir\"&gt;H\u00f6fu\u00f0lausnir&lt;/a&gt;\" (1988) and \"&lt;a href=\"H%C3%A6ttuleg%20hlj%C3%B3msveit%20%26amp%3B%20gl%C3%A6pakvendi%C3%B0%20Stella\"&gt;H\u00e6ttuleg hlj\u00f3msveit &amp; gl\u00e6pakvendi\u00f0 Stella&lt;/a&gt;\" (1990).\nIn the last quarter of 1988, the Sugarcubes toured North America to positive reception. On 15 October, the band appeared on \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20Live\"&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/a&gt;\". Bj\u00f6rk alone contributed a rendition of the &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; song \"J\u00f3lak\u00f6tturinn\" (\"The Christmas Cat\") on the compilation \"Hv\u00edt Er Borg Og B\u00e6r\". The band went on hiatus following the lack of reception of \"&lt;a href=\"Here%20Today%2C%20Tomorrow%20Next%20Week%21\"&gt;Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week!&lt;/a&gt;\" (1989) and a lengthy international tour. During this time, Bj\u00f6rk started working on her solo projects. In 1990 she provided background vocals on \"Gums\" by Bless. In the same year, she recorded \"&lt;a href=\"Gling-Gl%C3%B3\"&gt;Gling-Gl\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;\", a collection of popular &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; and original work, with the jazz group &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%AD%C3%B3%20Gu%C3%B0mundar%20Ing%C3%B3lfssonar\"&gt;Tr\u00ed\u00f3 Gu\u00f0mundar Ing\u00f3lfssonar&lt;/a&gt;, which was still her best-selling album in her home country. Bj\u00f6rk also contributed vocals to &lt;a href=\"808%20State\"&gt;808 State&lt;/a&gt;'s album \"\", with whom she cultivated her interest in &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house music&lt;/a&gt;. She contributed vocals on the songs \"Qmart\" and on \"Ooops\", which was released as a single in the UK in 1991. She also contributed vocals to the song \"Falling\", on the album \"&lt;a href=\"Island%20%28H%C3%96H%20and%20Current%2093%20album%29\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Current%2093\"&gt;Current 93&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hilmar%20%C3%96rn%20Hilmarsson\"&gt;Hilmar \u00d6rn Hilmarsson&lt;/a&gt;. In the same year she met &lt;a href=\"harpist\"&gt;harpist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Corky%20Hale\"&gt;Corky Hale&lt;/a&gt;, with whom she had a recording session that ended up as a track on her future album \"&lt;a href=\"Debut%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Debut&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAt this point, Bj\u00f6rk had decided to leave the band to pursue her solo career, but their contract included the making of one last album, \"&lt;a href=\"Stick%20Around%20for%20Joy\"&gt;Stick Around for Joy&lt;/a&gt;\" (1992), with a subsequent promotional tour, which she agreed to do. Bj\u00f6rk was featured on two tracks of the soundtrack for the 1992 film \"&lt;a href=\"Remote%20Control%20%281992%20film%29\"&gt;Remote Control&lt;/a&gt;\" (known as \"S\u00f3d\u00f3ma Reykjav\u00edk\" in Iceland). The Sugarcubes split up after they played one last show in Reykjav\u00edk. \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" has called them \"the biggest rock band to emerge from Iceland\".\n1993\u20131996: \"Debut\" and \"Post\".\nBj\u00f6rk moved to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to pursue a solo career; she began working with producer &lt;a href=\"Nellee%20Hooper\"&gt;Nellee Hooper&lt;/a&gt; (who had produced &lt;a href=\"Massive%20Attack\"&gt;Massive Attack&lt;/a&gt;, among others). Their partnership produced Bj\u00f6rk's first international solo hit, \"&lt;a href=\"Human%20Behaviour\"&gt;Human Behaviour&lt;/a&gt;\", a clattering dance track based on a guitar rhythm sampled from &lt;a href=\"Ant%C3%B4nio%20Carlos%20Jobim\"&gt;Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim&lt;/a&gt;. In most countries, the song was not widely played on radio, but its music video gained strong airtime on MTV. It was directed by &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Gondry\"&gt;Michel Gondry&lt;/a&gt;, who became a frequent collaborator for Bj\u00f6rk. Her first adult solo album, \"&lt;a href=\"Debut%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Debut&lt;/a&gt;\", was released in June 1993 to positive reviews; it was named album of the year by \"&lt;a href=\"NME\"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt;\" and eventually went &lt;a href=\"platinum%20album\"&gt;platinum&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. \"Debut\" was the leap Bj\u00f6rk made from being in numerous bands during her teens and early twenties to her solo career. She named the album \"Debut\" to signify a start of something new. \"Debut\" had a mix of songs Bj\u00f6rk had been writing since she was a teenager, as well as more recent lyrical collaborations with Hooper. The &lt;a href=\"Dance%20music\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt;-oriented album varied in instrumentation. One single from the album, \"&lt;a href=\"Venus%20as%20a%20Boy\"&gt;Venus as a Boy&lt;/a&gt;\", featured a &lt;a href=\"Bollywood\"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt;-influenced string arrangement. Bj\u00f6rk covered the jazz standard \"&lt;a href=\"Like%20Someone%20in%20Love\"&gt;Like Someone in Love&lt;/a&gt;\" to the accompaniment of a harp, and the final track, \"The Anchor Song\", was sung with only a saxophone ensemble for accompaniment.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"1994%20Brit%20Awards\"&gt;1994 Brit Awards&lt;/a&gt;, Bj\u00f6rk won the awards for &lt;a href=\"Brit%20Award%20for%20International%20Female%20Solo%20Artist\"&gt;Best International Female&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brit%20Award%20for%20International%20Breakthrough%20Act\"&gt;Best International Newcomer&lt;/a&gt;. The success of \"Debut\" enabled her to collaborate with British and other artists on one-off tracks. She worked with &lt;a href=\"David%20Arnold\"&gt;David Arnold&lt;/a&gt; on \"&lt;a href=\"Play%20Dead%20%28song%29\"&gt;Play Dead&lt;/a&gt;\", the theme to the 1993 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Young%20Americans%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Young Americans&lt;/a&gt;\" (which appeared as a bonus track on a re-release of \"Debut\"), collaborated on two songs for Tricky's \"&lt;a href=\"Nearly%20God\"&gt;Nearly God&lt;/a&gt;\" project, appeared on the track \"Lilith\" for the album \"&lt;a href=\"Not%20for%20Threes\"&gt;Not for Threes&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Plaid%20%28band%29\"&gt;Plaid&lt;/a&gt;, and co-wrote the song \"&lt;a href=\"Bedtime%20Story%20%28Madonna%20song%29\"&gt;Bedtime Story&lt;/a&gt;\" for &lt;a href=\"Madonna%20%28entertainer%29\"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt;'s 1994 album \"&lt;a href=\"Bedtime%20Stories%20%28Madonna%20album%29\"&gt;Bedtime Stories&lt;/a&gt;\". Bj\u00f6rk also had an uncredited role as a runway model in the 1994 film \"&lt;a href=\"Pr%C3%AAt-%C3%A0-Porter%20%28film%29\"&gt;Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Post%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;\" was Bj\u00f6rk's second solo studio album. Released in June 1995, the album was produced in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Nellee%20Hooper\"&gt;Nellee Hooper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tricky%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Tricky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Graham%20Massey\"&gt;Graham Massey&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"808%20State\"&gt;808 State&lt;/a&gt;, and electronica producer &lt;a href=\"Howie%20B\"&gt;Howie B&lt;/a&gt;. Building on the success of \"Debut\", Bj\u00f6rk continued to pursue different sounds, taking particular interest in dance and &lt;a href=\"techno\"&gt;techno&lt;/a&gt;. Production by Tricky and Howie B also provided trip hop/electronica-like sounds on tracks like \"&lt;a href=\"Possibly%20Maybe\"&gt;Possibly Maybe&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Enjoy\". It was these producers' influence along with older friend Graham Massey that inspired Bj\u00f6rk to create material like the storming &lt;a href=\"industrial%20music\"&gt;industrial&lt;/a&gt; beats of \"&lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Me%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20song%29\"&gt;Army of Me&lt;/a&gt;\". The album was ranked number 7 in \"&lt;a href=\"Spin%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt;\"'s \"Top 90 Albums of the '90s\" list and number 75 in its \"100 Greatest Albums, 1985\u20132005\" list. \"Post\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Homogenic\"&gt;Homogenic&lt;/a&gt;\" were placed back to back on &lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20Media\"&gt;Pitchfork Media&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Top Albums of the '90s\" list at numbers 21 and 20, respectively. In 2003, the album was ranked number 373 on \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine's list of &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time\"&gt;the 500 greatest albums of all time&lt;/a&gt;. During this period, the press exalted Bj\u00f6rk's eccentricity by creating a \"&lt;a href=\"pixie\"&gt;pixie&lt;/a&gt;\" persona around her, a descriptor she later confronted with her following albums.\nAlthough Bj\u00f6rk continued to receive more mainstream attention for her videos than her singles, \"Post\" included several UK pop hits and was eventually certified &lt;a href=\"RIAA%20certification\"&gt;platinum&lt;/a&gt; in the US. Bj\u00f6rk also contributed to the 1995 &lt;a href=\"Hector%20Zazou\"&gt;Hector Zazou&lt;/a&gt; collaborative album \"&lt;a href=\"Chansons%20des%20mers%20froides\"&gt;Chansons des mers froides&lt;/a&gt;\", singing the traditional Icelandic song \"&lt;a href=\"V%C3%ADsur%20Vatnsenda-R%C3%B3su\"&gt;V\u00edsur Vatnsenda-R\u00f3su&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOn 12 September 1996, obsessed fan &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20L%C3%B3pez%20%28stalker%29\"&gt;Ricardo L\u00f3pez&lt;/a&gt; mailed a &lt;a href=\"letter%20bomb\"&gt;letter bomb&lt;/a&gt; loaded with &lt;a href=\"sulphuric%20acid\"&gt;sulphuric acid&lt;/a&gt; to Bj\u00f6rk's London home before killing himself. The package was intercepted by the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Police%20Service\"&gt;Metropolitan Police Service&lt;/a&gt;. In her few public comments on this event, Bj\u00f6rk said she was \"very distressed\" by the incident and \"I make music, but in other terms, you know, people shouldn't take me too literally and get involved in my personal life.\"\n1997\u20132000: \"Homogenic\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\".\nBj\u00f6rk left London for Spain, where she recorded the album \"&lt;a href=\"Homogenic\"&gt;Homogenic&lt;/a&gt;\", released in 1997. Bj\u00f6rk worked with producers &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Bell%20%28British%20musician%29\"&gt;Mark Bell&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"LFO%20%28British%20band%29\"&gt;LFO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Howie%20B\"&gt;Howie B&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Eumir%20Deodato\"&gt;Eumir Deodato&lt;/a&gt;; numerous remixes followed. \"Homogenic\" is regarded as one of Bj\u00f6rk's most experimental and extroverted works, with enormous beats that reflect the landscape of Iceland, most notably in the song \"&lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3ga\"&gt;J\u00f3ga&lt;/a&gt;\", which fuses lush strings with rocky electronic crunches. The album was certified &lt;a href=\"RIAA%20certification\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; in the US in 2001. The album was backed by string of &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt;s, several of which received airplay on &lt;a href=\"MTV\"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;. The video for \"&lt;a href=\"Bachelorette%20%28song%29\"&gt;Bachelorette&lt;/a&gt;\" was directed by frequent collaborator &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Gondry\"&gt;Michel Gondry&lt;/a&gt;, while \"&lt;a href=\"All%20Is%20Full%20of%20Love\"&gt;All Is Full of Love&lt;/a&gt;\" was directed by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Cunningham\"&gt;Chris Cunningham&lt;/a&gt;. The single \"All is Full of Love\" was also the first &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; single to ever be released in the US, which paved the way for other artists to include DVD video and other &lt;a href=\"multimedia\"&gt;multimedia&lt;/a&gt; features with their singles. Bj\u00f6rk began to write more personally, saying \"I realised that I'd come to the end of the extrovert thing. I had to go home and search for myself again.\"\nIn 1999, Bj\u00f6rk was asked to write and produce the musical score for the film \"&lt;a href=\"Dancer%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;Dancer in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;\", a musical drama about an immigrant named Selma who is struggling to pay for an operation to prevent her son from going blind. Director &lt;a href=\"Lars%20von%20Trier\"&gt;Lars von Trier&lt;/a&gt; eventually asked her to consider playing the role of Selma, convincing her that the only true way to capture the character of Selma was to have the composer of the music play the character. Eventually, she accepted. Filming began in early 1999, and the film debuted in 2000 at the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;53rd Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. The film received the &lt;a href=\"Palme%20d%27Or\"&gt;Palme d'Or&lt;/a&gt;, and Bj\u00f6rk received the &lt;a href=\"Cannes%20Film%20Festival%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress\"&gt;Best Actress Award&lt;/a&gt; for her role. It was reported that the shoot was so physically and emotionally tiring that she vowed never to act again. Bj\u00f6rk later stated that she always wanted to do one musical in her life, and \"Dancer in the Dark\" was the one. The soundtrack Bj\u00f6rk created for the film was released with the title \"&lt;a href=\"Selmasongs\"&gt;Selmasongs&lt;/a&gt;\". The album features a duet with &lt;a href=\"Thom%20Yorke\"&gt;Thom Yorke&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Radiohead\"&gt;Radiohead&lt;/a&gt; titled \"&lt;a href=\"I%27ve%20Seen%20It%20All\"&gt;I've Seen It All&lt;/a&gt;\", which was nominated for an &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Song\"&gt;Academy Award for Best Original Song&lt;/a&gt; and was performed at the 2001 Oscars (without Yorke), while Bj\u00f6rk was wearing her celebrated &lt;a href=\"swan%20dress\"&gt;swan dress&lt;/a&gt;.\n2001\u20132003: \"Vespertine\" and \"Greatest Hits\".\nIn 2001, Bj\u00f6rk released the album \"&lt;a href=\"Vespertine\"&gt;Vespertine&lt;/a&gt;\". It featured chamber orchestras, choirs, hushed vocals, microbeats made from household sounds, and personal, vulnerable themes. For the album, she collaborated with experimental musicians such as &lt;a href=\"Matmos\"&gt;Matmos&lt;/a&gt;, Denmark-based &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Knak\"&gt;DJ Thomas Knak&lt;/a&gt;, and harpist &lt;a href=\"Zeena%20Parkins\"&gt;Zeena Parkins&lt;/a&gt;. Lyrical sources included the works of American &lt;a href=\"poetry\"&gt;poet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"E.%20E.%20Cummings\"&gt;E. E. Cummings&lt;/a&gt;, the American independent filmmaker &lt;a href=\"Harmony%20Korine\"&gt;Harmony Korine&lt;/a&gt;, and English playwright &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Kane\"&gt;Sarah Kane&lt;/a&gt;'s penultimate play, \"&lt;a href=\"Crave%20%28play%29\"&gt;Crave&lt;/a&gt;\". To coincide with the album's release, &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rk%20%28book%29\"&gt;an eponymous coffee table book&lt;/a&gt; of loose prose and photographs was published. Bj\u00f6rk embarked on the &lt;a href=\"Vespertine%20World%20Tour\"&gt;Vespertine World Tour&lt;/a&gt;. The shows were held in theatres and opera houses in order to have \"the best acoustics possible.\" She was accompanied by Matmos, Parkins and an &lt;a href=\"Inuit\"&gt;Inuit&lt;/a&gt; choir, whom she had held auditions for on a trip to Greenland prior to the tour. At the time, \"Vespertine\" was Bj\u00f6rk's fastest selling album to date, having sold two million copies by the end of 2001.\n\"Vespertine\" spawned three singles: \"&lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Place\"&gt;Hidden Place&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Pagan%20Poetry\"&gt;Pagan Poetry&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Cocoon%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20song%29\"&gt;Cocoon&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"MTV2\"&gt;MTV2&lt;/a&gt; played the album's first video, \"Hidden Place\", which was subsequently released as a DVD single. The next video, for \"Pagan Poetry\", brought Bj\u00f6rk to an even higher level of controversy with the channel. The video features graphic piercings, Bj\u00f6rk's exposed nipples, and simulated &lt;a href=\"fellatio\"&gt;fellatio&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the clip was banned from MTV. In 2002, it was aired unedited as part of a late night special on MTV2 titled, \"Most Controversial Music Videos\". The video for \"Cocoon\" also featured a seemingly naked Bj\u00f6rk (actually wearing a close fitting bodysuit), this time with her nipples secreting a red thread that eventually enveloped her in a cocoon. The video was directed by Japanese artist &lt;a href=\"Eiko%20Ishioka\"&gt;Eiko Ishioka&lt;/a&gt; and was not aired by MTV. She was invited to record \"&lt;a href=\"Gollum%27s%20Song\"&gt;Gollum's Song&lt;/a&gt;\" for the film \"\" but declined the invitation, as she was then pregnant; the song was instead recorded by another Icelander, &lt;a href=\"Emil%C3%ADana%20Torrini\"&gt;Emil\u00edana Torrini&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2002 the CD box set \"&lt;a href=\"Family%20Tree%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Family Tree&lt;/a&gt;\" was issued. It comprised selected rarities as well as previously unreleased versions of her compositions, including her work with the &lt;a href=\"Brodsky%20Quartet\"&gt;Brodsky Quartet&lt;/a&gt;. Also released alongside \"Family Tree\" was the album \"&lt;a href=\"Greatest%20Hits%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Greatest Hits&lt;/a&gt;\", a retrospective of the previous 10 years of her solo career as deemed by the public. The songs on the album were chosen by Bj\u00f6rk's fans through a poll on her website. A DVD edition of the CD was also released. It contained all of Bj\u00f6rk's solo music videos up to that point. The new single from the set, \"It's in Our Hands\" charted in the UK at number 37. The video, directed by &lt;a href=\"Spike%20Jonze\"&gt;Spike Jonze&lt;/a&gt;, features a heavily pregnant Bj\u00f6rk. She gave birth to daughter Isadora Bjarkardottir Barney on 3 October 2002. Bj\u00f6rk and the Brodsky Quartet recorded \"Prayer of the Heart\", a composition written for her by composer &lt;a href=\"John%20Tavener\"&gt;John Tavener&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, and it was played then for a slide show presentation in 2003 for the American photographer, &lt;a href=\"Nan%20Goldin\"&gt;Nan Goldin&lt;/a&gt;. In 2003, Bj\u00f6rk released a box set, \"&lt;a href=\"Live%20Box\"&gt;Live Box&lt;/a&gt;\", consisting of four CDs containing &lt;a href=\"concert\"&gt;live recordings&lt;/a&gt; of her previous albums and a DVD featuring a video of one track from each CD. Each of the four CDs was later released separately at a reduced price.\n2004\u20132006: \"Med\u00falla\" and \"Drawing Restraint 9\".\nIn August 2004, Bj\u00f6rk released \"&lt;a href=\"Med%C3%BAlla\"&gt;Med\u00falla&lt;/a&gt;\". During production, Bj\u00f6rk decided the album would work best as an entirely vocal-based album. This initial plan was modified, as the majority of the sounds on the album are indeed created by vocalists but several feature prominent basic electronic programming, as well as the occasional musical instrument. Bj\u00f6rk used the vocal skills of &lt;a href=\"Inuit%20throat%20singing\"&gt;throat singer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tanya%20Tagaq\"&gt;Tanya Tagaq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hip%20hop%20music\"&gt;hip hop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"beatboxing\"&gt;beatboxer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rahzel\"&gt;Rahzel&lt;/a&gt;, Japanese beatboxer &lt;a href=\"Dokaka\"&gt;Dokaka&lt;/a&gt;, avant-rocker &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Patton\"&gt;Mike Patton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soft%20Machine\"&gt;Soft Machine&lt;/a&gt; drummer/singer &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Wyatt\"&gt;Robert Wyatt&lt;/a&gt;, and several &lt;a href=\"choir\"&gt;choir&lt;/a&gt;s. She again appropriated text from E. E. Cummings for the song \"Sonnets/Unrealities XI\". At the time, \"Med\u00falla\" became her highest charting album in the US, debuting at number 14.\nIn August 2004, Bj\u00f6rk performed the song \"&lt;a href=\"Oceania%20%28song%29\"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Summer%20Olympics%20opening%20ceremony\"&gt;Opening Ceremony&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2004 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;. As she sang, her dress slowly unfurled to reveal a 10,000 square foot (900\u00a0m2) map of the world, which she let flow over all of the Olympic athletes. The song \"Oceania\" was written especially for the occasion and features the talents of &lt;a href=\"Shlomo%20%28beatboxing%20artist%29\"&gt;Shlomo&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"beatboxing\"&gt;beatboxer&lt;/a&gt;, and a London choir. An alternative version of the song began circulating on the Internet with additional vocals by &lt;a href=\"Kelis\"&gt;Kelis&lt;/a&gt;. It originally appeared on the promotional \"Oceania\" single released to radio stations and later became available to the public as a &lt;a href=\"A-side%20and%20B-side\"&gt;B-side&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Who%20Is%20It%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20song%29\"&gt;Who Is It&lt;/a&gt;\" single, which charted at number 26 in the UK. This was followed in early 2005 by \"&lt;a href=\"Triumph%20of%20a%20Heart\"&gt;Triumph of a Heart&lt;/a&gt;\", charting at number 31. A video for the potential next single, \"&lt;a href=\"Where%20Is%20the%20Line\"&gt;Where Is the Line&lt;/a&gt;\", was filmed in collaboration with the Icelandic artist &lt;a href=\"Gabr%C3%ADela%20Fri%C3%B0riksd%C3%B3ttir\"&gt;Gabr\u00edela Fri\u00f0riksd\u00f3ttir&lt;/a&gt; in late 2004. This was initially a sequence from an art installation movie of the artists but was released exclusively on the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Med%C3%BAlla%20Videos\"&gt;Med\u00falla Videos&lt;/a&gt;\" DVD as an official promo for the track.\nIn 2005, Bj\u00f6rk collaborated with partner &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Barney\"&gt;Matthew Barney&lt;/a&gt; on the experimental art film \"&lt;a href=\"Drawing%20Restraint%209\"&gt;Drawing Restraint 9&lt;/a&gt;\", a dialogueless exploration of &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese culture&lt;/a&gt;. Bj\u00f6rk and Barney both appear in the film, playing two occidental guests on a Japanese factory whaling vessel who ultimately transform into two whales. She is also responsible for the film's soundtrack, her second after \"Selmasongs\". Bj\u00f6rk also appeared in the 2005 documentary \"&lt;a href=\"Screaming%20Masterpiece\"&gt;Screaming Masterpiece&lt;/a&gt;\", which delves into the Icelandic music scene. The movie features archive footage of the Sugarcubes and &lt;a href=\"Tappi%20T%C3%ADkarrass\"&gt;Tappi T\u00edkarrass&lt;/a&gt; and an ongoing conversation with Bj\u00f6rk herself. During this era, Bj\u00f6rk earned another &lt;a href=\"BRIT%20Awards\"&gt;BRIT Awards&lt;/a&gt; nomination for Best International Female Solo Artist. She was also awarded the Inspiration Award at the Annual \"&lt;a href=\"Q%20magazine\"&gt;Q Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" Awards in October 2005, accepting the prize from Robert Wyatt, with whom she collaborated on \"Med\u00falla\". In 2006, Bj\u00f6rk remastered her first three solo studio albums (\"Debut\", \"Post\", \"Homogenic\") and her two soundtrack albums (\"Selmasongs\" and \"Drawing Restraint 9\") in 5.1 surround sound for a re-issue in a new box-set titled \"&lt;a href=\"Surrounded%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Surrounded&lt;/a&gt;\", released on 27 June. \"Vespertine\" and \"Med\u00falla\" were already available in 5.1 as either DVD-A or SACD but are also included in the box set in repackaged format. The &lt;a href=\"DualDisc\"&gt;DualDisc&lt;/a&gt;s were also released separately. Bj\u00f6rk's former band, the Sugarcubes, reunited for a one-night-only concert in Reykjav\u00edk on 17 November 2006. Profits from the concert were donated to the Sugarcubes' former label, &lt;a href=\"Smekkleysa\"&gt;Smekkleysa&lt;/a&gt;, who according to Bj\u00f6rk's press statement, \"continue to work on a non-profit basis for the future betterment of Icelandic music\".\n2007\u20132010: \"Volta\".\nBj\u00f6rk contributed a cover of &lt;a href=\"Joni%20Mitchell\"&gt;Joni Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;'s song \"The Boho Dance\" to the album \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Tribute%20to%20Joni%20Mitchell\"&gt;A Tribute to Joni Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;\" (2007). Director and previous collaborator &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Gondry\"&gt;Michel Gondry&lt;/a&gt; asked Bj\u00f6rk to star in his film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Science%20of%20Sleep\"&gt;The Science of Sleep&lt;/a&gt;\", but she declined. The role was played by &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20Gainsbourg\"&gt;Charlotte Gainsbourg&lt;/a&gt; instead. Bj\u00f6rk starred in Gunar Karlsson's 2007 animated film \"&lt;a href=\"Anna%20and%20the%20Moods\"&gt;Anna and the Moods&lt;/a&gt;\", along with &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Jones\"&gt;Terry Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Damon%20Albarn\"&gt;Damon Albarn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBj\u00f6rk's sixth full-length studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Volta%20%28album%29\"&gt;Volta&lt;/a&gt;\", was released on 7 May 2007. It features 10 tracks. It features input from hip hop producer &lt;a href=\"Timbaland\"&gt;Timbaland&lt;/a&gt;, singer &lt;a href=\"Anohni\"&gt;Anohni&lt;/a&gt;, poet &lt;a href=\"Sj%C3%B3n\"&gt;Sj\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, electronic beat programmer &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Bell%20%28British%20musician%29\"&gt;Mark Bell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kora%20%28instrument%29\"&gt;kora&lt;/a&gt; master &lt;a href=\"Toumani%20Diabat%C3%A9\"&gt;Toumani Diabat\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, Congolese thumb piano band &lt;a href=\"Konono%20No%201\"&gt;Konono No 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pipa\"&gt;pipa&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Min%20Xiaofen\"&gt;Min Xiaofen&lt;/a&gt;, and, on several songs, an all-female ensemble from Iceland performing &lt;a href=\"brass\"&gt;brass&lt;/a&gt; compositions. It also uses the &lt;a href=\"Reactable\"&gt;Reactable&lt;/a&gt;, a novel \"tangible-interface\" synthesizer from the &lt;a href=\"Universitat%20Pompeu%20Fabra\"&gt;Universitat Pompeu Fabra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, which on \"Volta\" is played by Damian Taylor. The first single from the album, \"&lt;a href=\"Earth%20Intruders\"&gt;Earth Intruders&lt;/a&gt;\", was released digitally on 9 April 2007 and became her second-ever &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; entry in the United States. \"Volta\" debuted at number nine on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20200\"&gt;\"Billboard\" 200&lt;/a&gt; albums chart, becoming her first top 10 album in the US, netting week-one sales of 43,000. The album also reached number three on the French albums chart with sales of 20,600 albums sold in its first week, and number seven in the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Albums%20Chart\"&gt;UK Albums Chart&lt;/a&gt; with 20,456 units sold. The second single from the album, \"&lt;a href=\"Innocence%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20song%29\"&gt;Innocence&lt;/a&gt;\", was digitally released on 23 July 2007, with an accompanying music video chosen from a contest conducted through her official website. \"&lt;a href=\"Declare%20Independence\"&gt;Declare Independence&lt;/a&gt;\" was released on 1 January 2008 in a super deluxe package including two 12\" vinyls, a CD, and a DVD featuring Gondry's \"Declare Independence\" video. \"&lt;a href=\"Wanderlust%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20song%29\"&gt;Wanderlust&lt;/a&gt;\" was subsequently released in a similar format, featuring Encyclopedia Pictura's short film directed for the track, shot in &lt;a href=\"stereoscopy\"&gt;stereoscopic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Three-dimensional%20space\"&gt;3D&lt;/a&gt;. The fifth single released from the album was \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dull%20Flame%20of%20Desire\"&gt;The Dull Flame of Desire&lt;/a&gt;\", featuring vocals by &lt;a href=\"Anohni\"&gt;Anohni&lt;/a&gt;.\nBj\u00f6rk then completed the 18-month &lt;a href=\"Volta%20Tour\"&gt;Volta Tour&lt;/a&gt;, having performed at many festivals and returning to Latin America after nine years, playing in &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Curitiba\"&gt;Curitiba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guadalajara\"&gt;Guadalajara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lima\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20de%20Chile\"&gt;Santiago de Chile&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, as part of different events. She also returned to Australia and New Zealand for the first time in 12 years in January 2008, touring the nations with the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Day%20Out\"&gt;Big Day Out&lt;/a&gt; Festival. She played a one-off show at the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Festival\"&gt;Sydney Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Her music was featured in the 2008 documentary \"Horizons: The Art of Steinunn \u00de\u00f3rarinsd\u00f3ttir\" directed by Frank Cantor.\nAnnounced via an &lt;a href=\"eBay\"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"auction\"&gt;auction&lt;/a&gt;, a new Bj\u00f6rk track was revealed under the title \"&lt;a href=\"N%C3%A1tt%C3%BAra\"&gt;N\u00e1tt\u00fara&lt;/a&gt;\". Bj\u00f6rk commented the song was intended \"to encourage active support for a more environmental approach to Iceland's natural resources.\" The song was initially labelled as a new single by Bj\u00f6rk, with backing vocals from Radiohead frontman &lt;a href=\"Thom%20Yorke\"&gt;Thom Yorke&lt;/a&gt;. Bj\u00f6rk's official website later stated that the single would be released on 27 October 2008 through &lt;a href=\"iTunes\"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, but the track was eventually made available at nattura.grapewire.net, exclusively.

A month later, Bj\u00f6rk, along with &lt;a href=\"Dirty%20Projectors\"&gt;Dirty Projectors&lt;/a&gt;, announced that they would be collaborating on a joint EP, titled \"&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Wittenberg%20Orca\"&gt;Mount Wittenberg Orca&lt;/a&gt;\", which was released on 30 June, to raise money for marine conservation. In September 2010, Bj\u00f6rk released \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Comet%20Song\"&gt;The Comet Song&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the soundtrack for the movie \"&lt;a href=\"Moomins%20and%20the%20Comet%20Chase\"&gt;Moomins and the Comet Chase&lt;/a&gt;\". Also in 2010, she dueted with fellow Icelander (and &lt;a href=\"One%20Little%20Indian\"&gt;One Little Indian&lt;/a&gt; labelmate) &lt;a href=\"%C3%93l%C3%B6f%20Arnalds\"&gt;\u00d3l\u00f6f Arnalds&lt;/a&gt; on a track called \"Surrender\" from Arnalds's new album, \"&lt;a href=\"Innundir%20skinni\"&gt;Innundir skinni&lt;/a&gt;\", and performed a duet with &lt;a href=\"Anohni\"&gt;Anohni&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Antony%20and%20the%20Johnsons\"&gt;Antony and the Johnsons&lt;/a&gt; album \"&lt;a href=\"Swanlights\"&gt;Swanlights&lt;/a&gt;\". The song is titled \"Fl\u00e9tta\". On 20 September 2010, Bj\u00f6rk performed her version of \"&lt;a href=\"Gloomy%20Sunday\"&gt;Gloomy Sunday&lt;/a&gt;\" at designer &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20McQueen\"&gt;Alexander McQueen&lt;/a&gt;'s memorial in St. Paul's cathedral in London. On 7 December 2010, a previously unreleased song, called \"Trance\", was released by Bj\u00f6rk as the backing track of a short film made by Nick Knight, titled \"To Lee, with Love\", as a tribute to McQueen, with whom Bj\u00f6rk collaborated on multiple occasions.\n2011\u20132014: \"Biophilia\".\nBj\u00f6rk appeared on \"\u00c1tta Raddir\", one of J\u00f3nas Sen's TV shows. The episode aired on 27 February 2011. The shows are produced by the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service. In the show Bj\u00f6rk performed eight songs, including \"Sun in My Mouth\", which had not previously been performed live.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Biophilia%20%28album%29\"&gt;Biophilia&lt;/a&gt;\" was released in 2011. The album project combined music with technological innovation and themes of science and nature, including an \"&lt;a href=\"Mobile%20app\"&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; album\", educational collaborations with children and specialized live performance, debuting in &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, United Kingdom at the &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20International%20Festival\"&gt;Manchester International Festival&lt;/a&gt; on 30 June. This was the first part of the &lt;a href=\"Biophilia%20Tour\"&gt;Biophilia Tour&lt;/a&gt;, that toured the world for two years.\nIn June 2011, the first single from \"Biophilia\", \"&lt;a href=\"Crystalline%20%28song%29\"&gt;Crystalline&lt;/a&gt;\", was released. The song was composed using one of the several instruments custom built for the project, the \"gameleste\", a &lt;a href=\"celesta\"&gt;celesta&lt;/a&gt; modified with elements of &lt;a href=\"gamelan\"&gt;gamelan&lt;/a&gt;. A central part of \"Biophilia\" was a series of interactive &lt;a href=\"iPad\"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt; apps made by programmers and designers, one app for each of the 10 songs on the new album. The second single, \"&lt;a href=\"Cosmogony%20%28song%29\"&gt;Cosmogony&lt;/a&gt;\", which served as the \"mother app\" for all the others, was released on 19 July 2011, followed by \"&lt;a href=\"Virus%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20song%29\"&gt;Virus&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Moon%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20song%29\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Biophilia\" was the first album to be released, in October 2011, as a series of interactive apps. Also in part of the project was Bj\u00f6rk's Biophilia education programme, which consisted of workshops for school-children aged 10\u201312, that explore the intersection of music and science. The Reykjavik City Board of Education brought the programme to all schools in the city over the next three years.\nShe released the 2012 remix album &lt;a href=\"Bastards%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;\"Bastards\"&lt;/a&gt;. It featured remixes by &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grips\"&gt;Death Grips&lt;/a&gt; and Syrian musician &lt;a href=\"Omar%20Souleyman\"&gt;Omar Souleyman&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, Bj\u00f6rk featured in a &lt;a href=\"Channel%204\"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt; documentary along with Sir &lt;a href=\"David%20Attenborough\"&gt;David Attenborough&lt;/a&gt; called \"&lt;a href=\"When%20Bj%C3%B6rk%20Met%20Attenborough\"&gt;When Bj\u00f6rk Met Attenborough&lt;/a&gt;\", as part of their \"Mad4Music\" season of programmes. Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough discussed the human relationship with music, focusing around \"&lt;a href=\"Biophilia%20%28album%29\"&gt;Biophilia&lt;/a&gt;\", and also featuring scientist &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Sacks\"&gt;Oliver Sacks&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014, the apps were the first ever to be inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art\"&gt;Museum of Modern Art&lt;/a&gt;'s permanent collection. In June, Bj\u00f6rk recorded original vocal samples for &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grips\"&gt;Death Grips&lt;/a&gt;, which they used on all 8 songs of \"Niggas on the Moon\", the first part of their double LP, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Powers%20That%20B\"&gt;The Powers That B&lt;/a&gt;\". In late 2014, a concert film, \"\", was released worldwide, including in more than 400 cinemas.\n2015\u20132016: \"Vulnicura\".\nBj\u00f6rk worked with producers &lt;a href=\"Arca%20%28producer%29\"&gt;Arca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Haxan%20Cloak\"&gt;the Haxan Cloak&lt;/a&gt; on her ninth studio album, titled \"&lt;a href=\"Vulnicura\"&gt;Vulnicura&lt;/a&gt;\". On 18 January 2015, just days after being publicly announced, and two months ahead of its scheduled release, a supposed full version of the album &lt;a href=\"Internet%20leak\"&gt;leaked online&lt;/a&gt;. In an effort to salvage potential losses in sales due to the leak and to allow fans to hear the album in superior quality, it was made available worldwide on 20 January 2015 on iTunes. \"Vulnicura\" is a portrayal of her breakup with former partner, &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Barney\"&gt;Matthew Barney&lt;/a&gt; with lyrics that are emotionally raw in comparison to the abstract concerns of her previous album. Its surprise release was positively compared to recent album releases from Madonna and &lt;a href=\"Beyonc%C3%A9\"&gt;Beyonc\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, the former of whom also released her album to iTunes after being leaked, and the latter of whom wanted to revolutionize how albums were released and consumed. Bj\u00f6rk began her world tour in March 2015 at &lt;a href=\"Carnegie%20Hall\"&gt;Carnegie Hall&lt;/a&gt; performing \"Black Lake\" and other tracks from \"Vulnicura\" as well as several from her back catalog with accompaniment from the ensemble &lt;a href=\"Alarm%20Will%20Sound\"&gt;Alarm Will Sound&lt;/a&gt;, Arca on electronics (on festival dates &lt;a href=\"the%20Haxan%20Cloak\"&gt;the Haxan Cloak&lt;/a&gt; took over) and percussionist &lt;a href=\"Manu%20Delago\"&gt;Manu Delago&lt;/a&gt;. After completing its New York residency, the tour travelled to Europe before ending in August 2015.New York's &lt;a href=\"MoMA\"&gt;MoMA&lt;/a&gt; hosted a &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rk%20%28exhibition%29\"&gt;retrospective exhibition&lt;/a&gt; from 8 March \u2013 7 June 2015 that chronicled Bj\u00f6rk's career from \"Debut\" to \"Biophilia\"; however, aspects of \"Vulnicura\" were included as well but not previously announced. The retrospective consisted of 4 parts: the \"Biophilia\" instruments (Tesla coil, &lt;a href=\"MIDI\"&gt;MIDI&lt;/a&gt; controlled organ, the newly created Gameleste, and gravity harp) were on display in the lobby of the museum and played automatically throughout the day, the MoMA commissioned video installation, \"Black Lake\", directed by &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Thomas%20Huang\"&gt;Andrew Thomas Huang&lt;/a&gt;, which consisted of 2 complementary edits of the \"Black Lake\" video screened in a small room with 49 speakers hidden in the walls and ceiling, a Cinema room showcasing most of Bj\u00f6rk's music videos, newly transferred in high definition, and the Songlines walking exhibit which showcased Bj\u00f6rk's notebooks, costumes and props from throughout her career. A book entitled \"\", documenting the content of the exhibition, was published in March. In addition to the \"Black Lake\" video, videos for \"Lionsong\" (which played in the Cinema room of the MoMA exhibit), \"Stonemilker\" (a 360-degree VR video) \"Family\", and \"Mouth Mantra\" were also produced for the album, as well as a three part remix series available digitally and on limited edition vinyls. No traditional singles were released for \"Vulnicura\". In December, the \"Stonemilker VR App\" was released for iOS devices, featuring an exclusive strings mix of the song. It is the same version on display at MoMA earlier that year.\nOn 2 October 2015, \"&lt;a href=\"Vulnicura%20Strings\"&gt;Vulnicura Strings&lt;/a&gt;\" was announced. The album serves as a purely acoustic companion to \"Vulnicura\", and features additional string arrangements plus the &lt;a href=\"viola%20organista\"&gt;viola organista&lt;/a&gt;, a unique string instrument played on a keyboard designed by &lt;a href=\"Leonardo%20da%20Vinci\"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt;. It was released on 6 November 2015 on CD and digital and 4 December 2015 on vinyl. A week later, \"&lt;a href=\"Vulnicura%20Live\"&gt;Vulnicura Live&lt;/a&gt;\" was announced on double CD / double LP sets sold exclusively through &lt;a href=\"Rough%20Trade%20%28shops%29\"&gt;Rough Trade&lt;/a&gt; record shops. The set sold out online five days after being announced but limited quantities were made available in store in London and Brooklyn. Each format is limited to 1000 copies each, making it one of the rarest physical releases of Bj\u00f6rk's recent career. The CD was released on 13 November 2015 with the picture disc vinyls released a week later. On 7 December 2015, \"Vulnicura\" was nominated for the &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album\"&gt;Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album&lt;/a&gt;. On 15 July 2016, a standard \"commercial\" edition of &lt;a href=\"Vulnicura%20Live%20%28commercial%20release%29\"&gt;\"Vulnicura Live\"&lt;/a&gt; was released, featuring the same performances but newly mixed and with different artwork. A luxury version of \"Vulnicura Live\" was released on 23 September. The performance of \"Come to Me\" from the album was also included in the box set \"7-inches for &lt;a href=\"Planned%20Parenthood\"&gt;Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt;\" in support of the women's health organization.\nBj\u00f6rk launched \"&lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rk%20Digital\"&gt;Bj\u00f6rk Digital&lt;/a&gt;\" in June 2016, a virtual reality exhibit showcasing all the VR videos completed for \"Vulnicura\" thus far, including the world premiere of \"Notget\", directed by Warren du Preez and Nick Thornton Jones, at &lt;a href=\"Carriageworks\"&gt;Carriageworks&lt;/a&gt; for Vivid Sydney 2016 in Sydney, Australia. She DJ'd the opening night party and did the same when the show traveled to Tokyo, Japan on 29 June, showing at Miraikan. During the Miraikan residency, Bj\u00f6rk made history by featuring in the world's first ever virtual reality live stream broadcast on YouTube. She gave a live performance of \"Vulnicura's\" final song \"Quicksand\", and the footage was incorporated into the \"Quicksand\" VR experience. \"Bj\u00f6rk Digital\" has travelled the world with stops in London, Montreal, Houston, Los Angeles and Barcelona.\n2017\u2013present: \"Utopia,\" \"Cornucopia\", \"The Northman\" and upcoming tenth studio album.\nOn 2 August 2017, Bj\u00f6rk announced with a handwritten note on her social media the imminent release of a new album. The announcement coincided with an interview for \"&lt;a href=\"Dazed\"&gt;Dazed&lt;/a&gt;\"s autumn 2017 cover issue in which Bj\u00f6rk talked about the new album. The lead single, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gate%20%28song%29\"&gt;The Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" was released on 15 September 2017. Its accompanying video was directed by visual artist &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Thomas%20Huang\"&gt;Andrew Thomas Huang&lt;/a&gt;. The same day of the single's release, Bj\u00f6rk announced the album's title, \"Utopia\", during an interview with &lt;a href=\"Nowness\"&gt;Nowness&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Utopia%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Utopia&lt;/a&gt;\" was released on 24 November 2017. She described it as her \"&lt;a href=\"Tinder%20%28app%29\"&gt;Tinder&lt;/a&gt; album\" and stated that \"it's about that search (for utopia) \u2013 and about being in love. Spending time with a person you enjoy is when the dream becomes real.\" Bj\u00f6rk added that her previous album was \"hell\" \u2013 it was like divorce!\", stating, \"So we [were] doing paradise [...] We have done hell, we have earned some points.\" She produced the album with &lt;a href=\"Arca%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Arca&lt;/a&gt;, whom she collaborated with on \"Vulnicura\". Bj\u00f6rk has described her collaborative journey with Arca as \"the strongest musical relationship [she's] had\", likening it to that of &lt;a href=\"Joni%20Mitchell\"&gt;Joni Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaco%20Pastorius\"&gt;Jaco Pastorius&lt;/a&gt; during the albums \"&lt;a href=\"Hejira%20%28album%29\"&gt;Hejira&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Juan%27s%20Reckless%20Daughter\"&gt;Don Juan's Reckless Daughter&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"It's that synergy when two people lose their ego\"), which have both been praised by Bj\u00f6rk. Three additional music videos were released in 2017: \"&lt;a href=\"Blissing%20Me\"&gt;Blissing Me&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Utopia\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Arisen%20My%20Senses\"&gt;Arisen My Senses&lt;/a&gt;\" with the former and latter also receiving limited edition remix EPs. \"Utopia\" was nominated for &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album\"&gt;Best Alternative Music Album&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"61st%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;61st Annual Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt;, making Bj\u00f6rk's fifteenth nomination at the Grammys.\nOn 22 May 2018, Bj\u00f6rk appeared as the headlining musical guest on \"&lt;a href=\"Later...%20with%20Jools%20Holland\"&gt;Later... with Jools Holland&lt;/a&gt;\", her first time on the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; series since 2011. She sang a set of four songs, including a flute rendition of \"The Anchor Song\" from 1993's \"Debut\" before embarking on the brief &lt;a href=\"Utopia%20Tour%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%29\"&gt;Utopia Tour&lt;/a&gt;, playing in several European music festivals during the summer. On 12 November 2018, Bj\u00f6rk announced a new concert production centered around her \"Utopia\" album, entitled &lt;a href=\"Cornucopia%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20concert%20tour%29\"&gt;Cornucopia&lt;/a&gt;. Bj\u00f6rk described the show as one \"where the acoustic and digital will shake hands\". Cornucopia opened in May 2019 at the newly built &lt;a href=\"The%20Shed%20%28Hudson%20Yards%29\"&gt;The Shed&lt;/a&gt; in New York and was described as Bj\u00f6rk's \"most elaborate staged concert to date.\" The &lt;a href=\"concert%20residency\"&gt;residency show&lt;/a&gt; then traveled to Mexico and Europe for further dates in 2019. Following the performances, Bj\u00f6rk released music videos for \"Tabula Rasa\" and \"Losss\", both directed by Tobias Gremmler and used as backdrop during the shows. On 16 August 2019, Bj\u00f6rk announced the \"Utopia Bird Call Boxset\", a box set meant to celebrate the end of the album cycle which 14 wooden flutes that imitate various bird calls and a USB stick featuring the digital albums, music videos and remixes, alongside an unreleased instrumental track, \"Arpegggio\". On 6 September 2019, two remixes of \"Features Creatures\" were released as digital singles, one by &lt;a href=\"Fever%20Ray\"&gt;Fever Ray&lt;/a&gt; and the other by &lt;a href=\"the%20Knife\"&gt;the Knife&lt;/a&gt;. Both remixes, as well as Bj\u00f6rk's own remix of Fever Ray's 2017 song, \"This Country\", were collected on \"&lt;a href=\"Country%20Creatures\"&gt;Country Creatures&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOn 27 September 2019, Bj\u00f6rk made a surprise appearance during \"Mutant;Faith\", Arca's performance-art piece at The Shed, to debut \"Afterwards\", a new collaboration which Bj\u00f6rk performed in a combination of Spanish and gibberish. The song is included on Arca's fourth studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Kick%20I\"&gt;KiCk i&lt;/a&gt;\", which was released on June 26, 2020. Bj\u00f6rk is currently set to embark on her eleventh concert tour, called &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rk%20Orkestral\"&gt;Bj\u00f6rk Orkestral&lt;/a&gt;, in which she will perform orchestral arrangements of songs from her career so far. As part of the tour, Bj\u00f6rk was scheduled to perform at the &lt;a href=\"Bluedot%20Festival\"&gt;Bluedot Festival&lt;/a&gt; in July 2020; however, the event was postponed due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and she is now scheduled to headline in 2022. Following the rescheduling, Bj\u00f6rk announced a series of concerts to be &lt;a href=\"Live%20streaming\"&gt;live streamed&lt;/a&gt; online for charity, with each concert featuring a different set of musicians and instruments and a unique set list.\nIn August 2020, Bj\u00f6rk joined the cast of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Northman\"&gt;The Northman&lt;/a&gt;\", the upcoming third feature film by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Eggers\"&gt;Robert Eggers&lt;/a&gt;, co-written with &lt;a href=\"Sj%C3%B3n\"&gt;Sj\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, alongside her daughter \u00cdsad\u00f3ra Bjarkard\u00f3ttir Barney, in her debut film role. It will be released on April 22, 2022.\nIn an interview with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mercury%20News\"&gt;The Mercury News&lt;/a&gt;\" published on 19 January 2022, Bj\u00f6rk mentioned that she was wrapping up work on her upcoming tenth studio album, estimating a summer 2022 release.\nOn 25 January 2022, in an interview with \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Times\"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;\", Bj\u00f6rk revealed that she was finishing the album, and \"it will definitely come out this year.\"\nArtistry.\nStyle.\nOver her three-decade solo career, Bj\u00f6rk has developed an &lt;a href=\"Eclecticism%20in%20music\"&gt;eclectic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"avant-garde%20music\"&gt;avant-garde&lt;/a&gt; musical style that incorporates aspects of electronic, &lt;a href=\"Dance%20music\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"alternative%20dance\"&gt;alternative dance&lt;/a&gt;, trip hop, &lt;a href=\"experimental%20music\"&gt;experimental&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glitch%20music\"&gt;glitch&lt;/a&gt;, jazz, alternative rock, &lt;a href=\"instrumental\"&gt;instrumental&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Contemporary%20classical%20music\"&gt;contemporary classical&lt;/a&gt; music. Her music has since been subject to critical analysis and scrutiny, as she consistently defies categorization in a musical genre. Although she often calls herself a &lt;a href=\"Pop%20music\"&gt;pop artist&lt;/a&gt;, she is considered a \"restlessly experimental creative force.\" According to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Yorker\"&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;\"s &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20Ho%20Bynum\"&gt;Taylor Ho Bynum&lt;/a&gt;, \"no contemporary artist so gracefully bridges the divide [between music experimentalist and pop celebrity] as Bj\u00f6rk.\" Her album \"&lt;a href=\"Debut%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Debut&lt;/a&gt;\", which incorporated &lt;a href=\"Electronic%20music\"&gt;electronic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"trip%20hop\"&gt;trip hop&lt;/a&gt;, has been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop. Her work has been described as \"frequently explor[ing] the relationship between nature and technology.\" Broadly summarizing her wide-ranging integration of art and popular music, Joshua Ostroff suggested that \"there is no better descriptor for what Bj\u00f6rk does than &lt;a href=\"art%20pop\"&gt;artpop&lt;/a&gt;.\" The \"&lt;a href=\"NME\"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt;\" also called her output a \"consistently &lt;a href=\"progressive%20pop\"&gt;progressive pop&lt;/a&gt; agenda.\"\nBj\u00f6rk's work is idiosyncratically collaborative, having worked with various producers, photographers, fashion designers and music video directors. She however believes that her male collaborators have received more credit than her, which Bj\u00f6rk attributes to her being a female artist.\nEvolution.\nDuring her career beginnings, Bj\u00f6rk performed in bands from various musical genres: &lt;a href=\"punk%20rock\"&gt;punk rock&lt;/a&gt; in Spit and Snot, &lt;a href=\"jazz%20fusion\"&gt;jazz fusion&lt;/a&gt; in Exodus, &lt;a href=\"post-punk\"&gt;post-punk&lt;/a&gt; in Tappi T\u00edkarrass and &lt;a href=\"goth%20rock\"&gt;gothic rock&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kukl%20%28band%29\"&gt;Kukl&lt;/a&gt;. When working with Tappi T\u00edkarrass, she was heavily influenced by British &lt;a href=\"New%20wave%20music\"&gt;new wave&lt;/a&gt; bands such as &lt;a href=\"Siouxsie%20and%20the%20Banshees\"&gt;Siouxsie and the Banshees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wire%20%28band%29\"&gt;Wire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Passions%20%28UK%20band%29\"&gt;the Passions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Slits\"&gt;the Slits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joy%20Division\"&gt;Joy Division&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Killing%20Joke\"&gt;Killing Joke&lt;/a&gt;. The studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Gling-Gl%C3%B3\"&gt;Gling-Gl\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;\" (1990) was recorded with &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%AD%C3%B3%20Gu%C3%B0mundar%20Ing%C3%B3lfssonar\"&gt;Tr\u00ed\u00f3 Gu\u00f0mundar Ing\u00f3lfssonar&lt;/a&gt; and featured jazz and popular standards sung \"very much in the classic &lt;a href=\"Ella%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Ella Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Vaughan\"&gt;Sarah Vaughan&lt;/a&gt; mould.\" The Sugarcubes' style has been described as &lt;a href=\"avant-pop%20music\"&gt;avant-pop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"alternative%20rock\"&gt;alternative rock&lt;/a&gt;. Although Bj\u00f6rk was in various post-punk and alternative rock bands during the late 1980s, her contact with London's underground &lt;a href=\"club%20culture\"&gt;club culture&lt;/a&gt; helped her find her own musical identity.\n\"Debut\" has been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop. Being a fan of dance music since the early days of [acid house], Bj\u00f6rk used dance music as the framework for her songs in \"Debut\", stating in 1993 that it was \"the only pop music that is truly modern\" and \"house is the only music where anything creative is happening today.\" However, in a \"Rolling Stone\" interview she also stated that \"[she] was more influenced by ambient music than what you'd call dance music, and by things that were happening way back in &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20house\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20techno\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt; that were sensual and daring and groundbreaking in their time.\" The music of \"Debut\" \"reflects the contemporary musical environment of London, where [Bj\u00f6rk] lived in the early 1990s, especially the burgeoning &lt;a href=\"trip-hop\"&gt;trip-hop&lt;/a&gt; scene of bands like &lt;a href=\"Portishead%20%28band%29\"&gt;Portishead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Massive%20Attack\"&gt;Massive Attack&lt;/a&gt;. Michael Cragg of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" has described it as an \"indefinable conflation of &lt;a href=\"electropop\"&gt;electronic pop&lt;/a&gt;, trip-hop, &lt;a href=\"world%20music\"&gt;world music&lt;/a&gt; and otherworldly lyrics\"; while \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Face%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;The Face&lt;/a&gt;\"s Mandi James said it was \"a delightful fusion of &lt;a href=\"thrash%20metal\"&gt;thrash metal&lt;/a&gt;, jazz, funk and &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;, with the odd dash of &lt;a href=\"exotica\"&gt;exotica&lt;/a&gt; thrown in for good measure.\"\nThe 1995 album \"Post\", known for its &lt;a href=\"eclecticism\"&gt;eclecticism&lt;/a&gt;, is considered to be the \"quintessential Bj\u00f6rk\" release, due to its protean form \u2013 more than any of her albums \u2013 and its \"wide emotional palette\". The entirety of the album was written after Bj\u00f6rk's move to England, and intended to reflect the faster pace of her new urban life. \"The Guardian\" wrote that \"\"Post\" tapped into the vortex of &lt;a href=\"multicultural\"&gt;multicultural&lt;/a&gt; energy that was mid-90s &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, where she had relocated and where strange hybrids such as &lt;a href=\"Oldschool%20jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trip-hop\"&gt;trip-hop&lt;/a&gt; were bubbling.\" \"Post\" built on the dance-pop blueprint of \"Debut\", but pushed its production and &lt;a href=\"Beat%20%28music%29\"&gt;beats&lt;/a&gt; to the fore, \"adding influence from all over the world.\" While the \"distant echoes\" of &lt;a href=\"Intelligent%20dance%20music\"&gt;IDM&lt;/a&gt; and trip-hop were present in \"Debut\", \"Post\" is characterized by Bj\u00f6rk's fuller incorporation of these styles. Referred to as a \"&lt;a href=\"Musical%20genre\"&gt;genre&lt;/a&gt; roulette\" by the \"&lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Chronicle\"&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\", it touches on various musical styles, including &lt;a href=\"industrial%20music\"&gt;industrial music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Big%20band\"&gt;big-band jazz&lt;/a&gt;, trip-hop, &lt;a href=\"Chill-out%20music\"&gt;chillout&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"experimental%20music\"&gt;experimental music&lt;/a&gt;. The balance between synthetic and organic elements in the album \u2013 generated through the combination of electronic and \"real\" instruments \u2013 is a recurring characteristic in Bj\u00f6rk's output.\nWith her 1997 album \"Homogenic\", Bj\u00f6rk intended to make a \"simple record with 'only one flavour'\", in contrast with her previous releases. Conceptually focused on her native &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, the album is a \"fusion of chilly strings (courtesy of the Icelandic String Octet), stuttering, abstract beats, and unique touches like &lt;a href=\"accordion\"&gt;accordion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"glass%20harmonica\"&gt;glass harmonica&lt;/a&gt;\". Bj\u00f6rk incorporated a traditional singing method used by Icelandic choir men, a combination of speaking and singing as illustrated in the song \"&lt;a href=\"Unravel%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20song%29\"&gt;Unravel&lt;/a&gt;\". While \"Homogenic\" still showed Bj\u00f6rk \"steeping in the cutting edge of &lt;a href=\"Rave%20culture\"&gt;electronic dance-music culture&lt;/a&gt;, her embrace of &lt;a href=\"techno\"&gt;techno&lt;/a&gt; futurism, her time spent pulling all-nighters in London clubs\", Neva Chonin of \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" stated the album was \"certain to be rough going for fans looking for the sweet melodies and peppy dance collages of her earlier releases.\"\nOn the 2001 album \"Vespertine\", Bj\u00f6rk continued with her idiosyncratic general meshing of organic and synthetic textures, once again via the combination of electronic sounds and string arrangements. However, \"Vespertine\" differed from \"Homogenic\" in its greater interest in intimacy and sexuality (the result of her new relationship with artist &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Barney\"&gt;Matthew Barney&lt;/a&gt;), and \"its desire for stark melodies and minimalist production.\" \"Vespertine\" is also characterized by \"the obsession with sonic traces of analog technology \u2013 that is, the pervasive use of &lt;a href=\"Loop%20%28music%29\"&gt;loops&lt;/a&gt;, static and &lt;a href=\"white%20noise\"&gt;white noise&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 despite the obviously digital orientation of twenty-first-century electronics\"; thus, elements of &lt;a href=\"Glitch%20%28music%29\"&gt;glitch music&lt;/a&gt; have been identified. Unlike previous albums like \"&lt;a href=\"Debut%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Debut&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Post%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20album%29\"&gt;Post&lt;/a&gt;\", \"electronic sounds are the norm, and the acoustic sounds become the interjections.\" Bj\u00f6rk also stepped away from her signature shrieking singing style; her vocals often appear to be recorded close to the microphone and with little treatment, and sung in a sometimes \"unstable whisper\", conveying a sense of close proximity and reduced space suitable for the intimate lyrics.\nBj\u00f6rk's 2004 studio album, \"Med\u00falla\", is almost entirely constructed with human vocals. \"&lt;a href=\"musicOMH\"&gt;musicOMH&lt;/a&gt;\"s review stated that: \"Despite its voice-only premise, \"Med\u00falla\" shows off a mile-wide scope of influences\"; noting elements of folk and &lt;a href=\"medieval%20music\"&gt;medieval music&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"eMusic\"&gt;Wondering Sound&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that despite \"its comparative starkness, [\"Med\u00falla\" is] every bit as sensual as [\"Vespertine\"].\" The publication also added: \"The electronic treatments range from industrial distortion to percussive &lt;a href=\"glitch\"&gt;glitch&lt;/a&gt;es and dreamy layering, rarely descending into novelty.\" The album combines &lt;a href=\"beatboxing\"&gt;beatboxing&lt;/a&gt;, classical choirs that suggest composers like &lt;a href=\"Penderecki\"&gt;Penderecki&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Arvo%20P%C3%A4rt\"&gt;Arvo P\u00e4rt&lt;/a&gt;, and \"mews, moans, counterpoint and guttural grunts\" provided by Bj\u00f6rk and guests like &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Patton\"&gt;Mike Patton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Wyatt\"&gt;Robert Wyatt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanya%20Tagaq\"&gt;Tanya Tagaq&lt;/a&gt;. \"Med\u00falla\" includes \"vocal fantasias\" that lean toward &lt;a href=\"chamber%20music\"&gt;chamber music&lt;/a&gt;, alongside tracks that \"are obviously but distantly connected to hip-hop.\" Glimpses of Bulgarian women's choirs, the &lt;a href=\"polyphony\"&gt;polyphony&lt;/a&gt; of central African &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20peoples\"&gt;pygmies&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"primal vocalisms\" of &lt;a href=\"Meredith%20Monk\"&gt;Meredith Monk&lt;/a&gt; were also noted.\n\"Volta\", released in 2007, received coverage after the inclusion of R&amp;B producer &lt;a href=\"Timbaland\"&gt;Timbaland&lt;/a&gt;; however, \"NME\" wrote that \"this is not Bj\u00f6rk 'going hip-hop' or having a late-breaking pop reinvention.\" It has been said that the album: \"finds the perfect balance between the vibrancy of her poppier work in the '90s and her experiments in the 2000s.\" Bj\u00f6rk wanted the album's beats to be \"effortless, primitive, &lt;a href=\"lo-fi\"&gt;lo-fi&lt;/a&gt; style\", in contrast with \"Vespertine\". It combines a large &lt;a href=\"Brass%20instrument\"&gt;brass ensemble&lt;/a&gt; with live and programmed drums and \"ethnic instruments\" like &lt;a href=\"likemb%C3%A9\"&gt;likemb\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pipa\"&gt;pipa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kora%20%28instrument%29\"&gt;kora&lt;/a&gt;. \"Volta\" alternates between potent, joyful songs, and moodier, more contemplative tracks, \"all of which are tied together by found-sound and brass-driven interludes that give the impression that the album was recorded in a harbor\".\n\"Biophilia\", of 2011, showcases Bj\u00f6rk's more avant-garde tendencies, drawing comparisons to Stockhausen and Nico's 1969 album, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Marble%20Index\"&gt;The Marble Index&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe music in \"Vulnicura\" is centered on Bj\u00f6rk's voice, orchestral strings and electronic beats. This combination was already present in \"Homogenic\", certainly the consequence of the common topics treated by both albums: \"heartbreak and perseverance\".\n\"Utopia\" harkened back to previous works such as \"Vespertine\" and \"Homogenic,\" combining organic and electronic elements. It has been referred to Bj\u00f6rk's flute album, akin to the heavy prevalence of \"Vespertine's\" &lt;a href=\"Celesta\"&gt;celeste&lt;/a&gt;, \"Volta's\" brass, \"Medulla's\" voices and \"Biophilia's\" choir. &lt;a href=\"Arca%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Arca&lt;/a&gt; and Bj\u00f6rk closely collaborated together in the album's production, and more consistently than her work with the late &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Bell%20%28British%20musician%29\"&gt;Mark Bell&lt;/a&gt;. The Venezuelan producer also takes a lead role in production.\nInfluences.\nWhile Bj\u00f6rk said that she was influenced by \"Everything\", she told biographer Mark Pytlik: \"If I were to say who influenced me most, I would say people like &lt;a href=\"Karlheinz%20Stockhausen\"&gt;Stockhausen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kraftwerk\"&gt;Kraftwerk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Eno\"&gt;Brian Eno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Bell%20%28British%20musician%29\"&gt;Mark Bell&lt;/a&gt;.\" Some \"confessional singer-songwriters\" Bj\u00f6rk commends include &lt;a href=\"Abida%20Parveen\"&gt;Abida Parveen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaka%20Khan\"&gt;Chaka Khan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joni%20Mitchell\"&gt;Joni Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kate%20Bush\"&gt;Kate Bush&lt;/a&gt;, the latter being a definitive influence in her career. Mitchell also inspired her to write her own songs, saying that that Mitchell \"created her own [female musical universe]\", and found it \"very liberating.\"\nDuring her formative years at music school, Bj\u00f6rk became interested in avant-garde, classical, and &lt;a href=\"minimalistic%20music\"&gt;minimalistic music&lt;/a&gt;; also becoming a \"jazz freak\". Although her music is more consistently tonal and has more crossover appeal, she is considered indebted to avant-garde composers &lt;a href=\"Karlheinz%20Stockhausen\"&gt;Karlheinz Stockhausen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meredith%20Monk\"&gt;Meredith Monk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Ra\"&gt;Sun Ra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Glass\"&gt;Philip Glass&lt;/a&gt;. In a 2008 article for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", Bj\u00f6rk considered Stockhausen as the root of electronic music, writing \"he sparked off a sun that is still burning and will glow for a long time.\" Early in her career, Bj\u00f6rk cited &lt;a href=\"Sir%20David%20Attenborough\"&gt;Sir David Attenborough&lt;/a&gt; as her biggest musical influence, saying \"she identified with his thirst for exploring new and wild territories.\" She also stated that she \"[likes] to discover sounds I had never heard before.\"\nVoice.\nBj\u00f6rk is a &lt;a href=\"soprano\"&gt;soprano&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"Vocal%20range\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt; spanning from &lt;a href=\"E%20%28musical%20note%29\"&gt;E3&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"D%20%28musical%20note%29\"&gt;D6&lt;/a&gt;. Her singing voice has been described as both \"elastic\" and \"somersaulting\" in quality as well as being praised for her &lt;a href=\"scat%20singing\"&gt;scatting&lt;/a&gt; ability, unique vocal stylings and delivery. In a review for her live performance at the 2011 &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20International%20Festival\"&gt;Manchester International Festival&lt;/a&gt;, Bernadette McNulty of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\" commented, \"the 45-year-old still uses electronic dance beats with a full-blooded raver's passion and the elemental &lt;a href=\"timbre\"&gt;timbre&lt;/a&gt; of her voice has grown more powerful with age\".\nIn late 2012, it was reported that Bj\u00f6rk had undergone surgery for a &lt;a href=\"Polyp%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;polyp&lt;/a&gt; on her vocal cords. Commenting on the success of the procedure after years of maintaining a strict diet and using vocal exercises to prevent vocal injury, she \"stayed quiet for three weeks and then started singing and definitely feel like my cords are as good as pre-&lt;a href=\"Vocal%20nodules\"&gt;nodule&lt;/a&gt;\". However, in a review for \"Biophilia,\" &lt;a href=\"Kitty%20Empire\"&gt;Kitty Empire&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" stated that pre-surgery Bj\u00f6rk still sounded strong, commenting that her voice was \"spectacular and swooping\", particularly on the song \"Thunderbolt\".\nIn a similar vein, Matthew Cole of \"&lt;a href=\"Slant%20Magazine\"&gt;Slant Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" adds that her voice has been \"preserved quite well\"; however, he also suggests that \"her once-formidable wail is too hoarse and shouty to be the ace in the hole that it once was\", adding \"it's only where her most dramatic vocal pyrotechnics are concerned that there's any question of physical ability\". &lt;a href=\"NPR\"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt; counted Bj\u00f6rk among its list of \"50 Great Voices\" and MTV placed her at number 8 on its countdown \"22 Greatest Voices in Music.\" She has been ranked 60th as one of the 100 greatest singers ever, and 81st as one of the 100 greatest songwriters ever by \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\", who praised her voice as being unique, fresh and extremely versatile, fitting and being influenced by a wide range of influences and genres.\nPersonal life.\nWhen forming &lt;a href=\"the%20Sugarcubes\"&gt;the Sugarcubes&lt;/a&gt;, Bj\u00f6rk had a brief marriage with guitarist \u00de\u00f3r Eldon. They had a son, Sindri Eldon \u00de\u00f3rsson, born 8 June 1986, the same day that the band was formed. They had divorced before the end of 1986, but continued to work together in the band.\nMove to London/Spain.\nFollowing the breakup of the Sugarcubes, Bj\u00f6rk moved to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, where she was immediately offered a record deal. She became engaged to London based DJ &lt;a href=\"Goldie\"&gt;Goldie&lt;/a&gt;, but broke up with him in 1996. She also had a brief relationship with musician &lt;a href=\"Tricky%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Tricky&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s. During this period, she became involved with the &lt;a href=\"trip%20hop\"&gt;trip hop&lt;/a&gt; scene with which Goldie and Tricky were associated. Bj\u00f6rk also began her work with fashion designer &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20McQueen\"&gt;Alexander McQueen&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of her time spent in London, Bj\u00f6rk developed a &lt;a href=\"cockney\"&gt;cockney&lt;/a&gt; accent, evident in her interviews given in English at the time.\nIn London, Bj\u00f6rk grew tired of public life and the constant harassment from the paparazzi, in particular over her relationships with Tricky and Goldie. She moved to Spain after receiving an offer to stay there from Trevor Morais, her tour drummer, who had a residential studio at &lt;a href=\"Marbella\"&gt;Marbella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andalusia\"&gt;Andalusia&lt;/a&gt;, where she produced \"&lt;a href=\"Homogenic\"&gt;Homogenic&lt;/a&gt;\" (1997).\nMatthew Barney.\nIn the late 1990s, Bj\u00f6rk lived in New York, where she met artist &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Barney\"&gt;Matthew Barney&lt;/a&gt; in the art scene. The pair formed a relationship and started living together, moving to &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Heights\"&gt;Brooklyn Heights&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. Their daughter Isadora Barney was born in 2002. Barney and Bj\u00f6rk initially kept their work separate, but then collaborated on Barney's art film \"&lt;a href=\"Drawing%20Restraint%209\"&gt;Drawing Restraint 9&lt;/a&gt;\", a long-term project released in 2005; Bj\u00f6rk acted in the film and also contributed musical elements. The couple broke up in 2013. At the time, she described it as \"the most painful thing\" that she had ever experienced. The album \"&lt;a href=\"Vulnicura\"&gt;Vulnicura&lt;/a&gt;\", and in particular the track \"Black Lake\", were written about the breakup. Bj\u00f6rk began to reside half of each year in Brooklyn Heights and the other half in two residences in Iceland with her daughter.\nPaparazzi confrontations.\nIn February 1996, Bj\u00f6rk arrived at &lt;a href=\"Don%20Mueang%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Bangkok International Airport&lt;/a&gt; with her son Sindri after a long-haul flight. Reporters were present, despite Bj\u00f6rk's early request that the press leave her and her son alone until a press conference. As Bj\u00f6rk attempted to walk away from the &lt;a href=\"paparazzi\"&gt;paparazzi&lt;/a&gt;, television reporter Julie Kaufman approached Sindri and said, \"Welcome to Bangkok!\" In response, Bj\u00f6rk lunged at Kaufman, knocking her to the ground and banging her head against the concrete floor until security intervened. Bj\u00f6rk later apologized to Kaufman, who declined to press charges.\nOn 13 January 2008, Bj\u00f6rk attacked a photographer who had photographed her arrival at &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Auckland International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in New Zealand for her scheduled performance at the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Day%20Out\"&gt;Big Day Out&lt;/a&gt; festival. Bj\u00f6rk allegedly tore the photographer's shirt down the back, and in the process she fell to the ground. Neither the photographer nor his employer, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Zealand%20Herald\"&gt;The New Zealand Herald&lt;/a&gt;\", lodged a formal complaint, and Auckland police did not investigate further.\nOther ventures.\nCharitable work.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami\"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; that struck &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt; in late 2004, Bj\u00f6rk began work on a new project titled \"\" to help raise money for a relief fund. This project recruited fans and musicians from around the world to either cover or remix the 1995 track \"Army of Me.\" From over 600 responses, Bj\u00f6rk and her co-writer Graham Massey picked the best 20 versions to appear on the album. The album was released in April in the UK and in late May 2005 in the US. By January 2006, the album had raised about \u00a3250,000 to help &lt;a href=\"UNICEF\"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt;'s work in the southeast Asian region. Bj\u00f6rk visited &lt;a href=\"Banda%20Aceh\"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt; in February 2006 to view some of UNICEF's work with the children who were affected by the tsunami.\nOn 2 July 2005, Bj\u00f6rk took part in the &lt;a href=\"Live%208\"&gt;Live 8&lt;/a&gt; series of concerts, headlining the &lt;a href=\"Live%208%20concert%2C%20Chiba\"&gt;Japan show&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Do%20As%20Infinity\"&gt;Do As Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Good%20Charlotte\"&gt;Good Charlotte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"McFly\"&gt;McFly&lt;/a&gt;. She performed eight songs with &lt;a href=\"Matmos\"&gt;Matmos&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;a href=\"String%20instrument\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Octet%20%28music%29\"&gt;octet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zeena%20Parkins\"&gt;Zeena Parkins&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical activity.\nBj\u00f6rk's years in &lt;a href=\"Kukl%20%28band%29\"&gt;Kukl&lt;/a&gt; aligned her with the &lt;a href=\"anarchist\"&gt;anarchist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Crass%20Collective\"&gt;Crass Collective&lt;/a&gt;. While she has since been hesitant to be seen as an overtly political figure, and has said so on her website, she is supportive of numerous &lt;a href=\"liberation%20movement\"&gt;liberation movement&lt;/a&gt;s, including &lt;a href=\"Kosovo%20independence%20precedent\"&gt;independence for Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe dedicated her song \"&lt;a href=\"Declare%20Independence\"&gt;Declare Independence&lt;/a&gt;\" to &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Faroe%20Islands\"&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/a&gt;, which caused a minor controversy in the Faroes. After Bj\u00f6rk twice dedicated \"Declare Independence\" to the people of &lt;a href=\"Kosovo\"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; during a concert in Japan, her upcoming performance at &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Exit%20%28festival%29\"&gt;Exit Festival&lt;/a&gt; was cancelled, reportedly for safety concerns. In 2008, Bj\u00f6rk created international controversy after she dedicated \"Declare Independence\" to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Tibet%20Independence%20Movement\"&gt;Tibet freedom movement&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; concert, chanting \"Tibet! Tibet!\" during the song. China's &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Culture%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Ministry of Culture&lt;/a&gt; issued a denunciation through state news agency &lt;a href=\"Xinhua%20News%20Agency\"&gt;Xinhua&lt;/a&gt;, stating that Bj\u00f6rk \"broke Chinese law\" and \"hurt Chinese people's feelings\" and pledged to further tighten control over foreign artists performing in China. A later statement accused Bj\u00f6rk of \"whipping up ethnic hatred.\" In 2014, Bj\u00f6rk created a Facebook post dedicating the song to the people of Scotland as they neared the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Scottish%20independence%20referendum\"&gt;referendum on their independence&lt;/a&gt;. In October 2017, she posted a &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; dedicating the song to &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalonia&lt;/a&gt; on the occasion of the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Catalan%20independence%20referendum\"&gt;Catalan independence referendum&lt;/a&gt;.\nBj\u00f6rk has also taken an interest in environmental issues in Iceland. In 2004, she took part in the H\u00e6tta concert in Reykjav\u00edk, organised in protest against the building of &lt;a href=\"Alcoa\"&gt;Alcoa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"aluminium\"&gt;aluminium&lt;/a&gt; smelters in the country, which would make Iceland the biggest smelter in Europe. She founded the organisation N\u00e1tt\u00fara, which aims to promote Icelandic nature and grassroots industries. In October 2008, Bj\u00f6rk wrote an article for \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Times\"&gt;the Times&lt;/a&gt;\" about the Icelandic economy and provided her opinion on the proposed use of natural resources to rescue the country from debt. In collaboration with &lt;a href=\"Audur%20Capital\"&gt;Audur Capital&lt;/a&gt;, she set up a venture capital fund titled BJ\u00d6RK to support the creation of sustainable industries in Iceland.\nBj\u00f6rk wrote the &lt;a href=\"foreword\"&gt;foreword&lt;/a&gt; to the English translation of the Icelandic bestseller by &lt;a href=\"Andri%20Sn%C3%A6r%20Magnason\"&gt;Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason&lt;/a&gt; titled \"Dreamland.\"\nOn 21 May 2010, Bj\u00f6rk wrote an open letter in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Reykjav%C3%ADk%20Grapevine\"&gt;The Reykjav\u00edk Grapevine&lt;/a&gt;\" calling on the Icelandic government to \"do everything in its power to revoke the contracts with &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Energy\"&gt;Magma Energy&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Canadian company that owns Icelandic geothermal company &lt;a href=\"Alterra%20Power\"&gt;HS Orka&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2014, Bj\u00f6rk helped to organise Stopp, Let's Protect the Park, an event organised to raise money and awareness for the preservation of Icelandic nature. This included a show at &lt;a href=\"Harpa%20%28concert%20hall%29\"&gt;Harpa Concert Hall&lt;/a&gt;, at which she performed three songs. The concert initially raised $310,000 and went on to raise \u00a33 million overall, with plans to use the money to establish a national park.\nProt\u00e9g\u00e9s.\nOver her extensive career, Bj\u00f6rk has frequently used her position and influence to help launch new acts or &lt;a href=\"mentor\"&gt;mentor&lt;/a&gt; them as they establish themselves as recording artists.\nThe first example was the Iranian-born &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt; producer &lt;a href=\"Leila%20Arab\"&gt;Leila Arab&lt;/a&gt;, who was initially recruited to play &lt;a href=\"Keyboard%20instrument\"&gt;keyboards&lt;/a&gt; and provide backing vocals on Bj\u00f6rk's first international solo &lt;a href=\"Debut%20Tour\"&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt; in 1993 in support of \"Debut\". In 1995, Bj\u00f6rk recalled Arab for her second touring band for tour in support of \"Post\". This time, Arab was given her first opportunity to experiment with live output mixing from the stage rather than playing keyboards. This would later form the basis of Arab's own solo music career, in which she has integrated live mixing into her own compositions and live shows. Arab went on to release three international solo albums throughout the 1990s and appears on the influential &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt; labels &lt;a href=\"Rephlex%20Records\"&gt;Rephlex Records&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"XL%20Recordings\"&gt;XL Recordings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warp%20%28record%20label%29\"&gt;Warp Records&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1998, Bj\u00f6rk established her own short-lived record label, Ear Records, which operated under the &lt;a href=\"One%20Little%20Indian%20Records\"&gt;One Little Indian Records&lt;/a&gt; umbrella. Her only signee that received a release was her longtime friend Magga St\u00edna, who recorded her debut solo album under the production of Bj\u00f6rk's longtime collaborator &lt;a href=\"Graham%20Massey\"&gt;Graham Massey&lt;/a&gt; (of the British electronica act &lt;a href=\"808%20State\"&gt;808 State&lt;/a&gt;). The album was simply titled \"An Album\" and featured just one single release, \"Naturally.\" In 1998, Bj\u00f6rk invited Magga to perform as her support act on the Homogenic Tour, and in 2004 Magga contributed to the production of \"&lt;a href=\"Med%C3%BAlla\"&gt;Med\u00falla&lt;/a&gt;\". Magga still performs and records in Iceland.\nIn 2001, Bj\u00f6rk became aware of Canadian &lt;a href=\"Inuit%20throat%20singing\"&gt;Inuit throat singer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tanya%20Tagaq\"&gt;Tanya Tagaq&lt;/a&gt; and invited her to perform on several dates of Bj\u00f6rk's &lt;a href=\"Vespertine%20World%20Tour\"&gt;Vespertine World Tour&lt;/a&gt; as a special guest. In 2004, Tagaq was invited to collaborate on the &lt;a href=\"a%20cappella\"&gt;a cappella&lt;/a&gt; album \"Med\u00falla\", in which the duet \"Ancestors\" was recorded. \"Ancestors\" was later featured on Tagaq's first solo album, \"&lt;a href=\"Sinaa\"&gt;Sinaa&lt;/a&gt;\", in 2005.\nIn 2004, Arab discovered the work of Finnish multimedia artist Heidi Kilpel\u00e4inen, who had taken her combination of &lt;a href=\"lo-fi%20music\"&gt;lo-fi&lt;/a&gt;, homemade &lt;a href=\"electro%20%28music%29\"&gt;electro&lt;/a&gt; pop with her own self-produced &lt;a href=\"music%20videos\"&gt;music videos&lt;/a&gt; and combined them under the &lt;a href=\"alter%20ego\"&gt;alter ego&lt;/a&gt; character &lt;a href=\"HK119\"&gt;HK119&lt;/a&gt;. Leila soon referred HK119's work to Bj\u00f6rk, who started mentioning HK119 in various press and interviews. In 2004, Arab announced HK119 as her favourite act of 2004. HK119 was soon signed to Bj\u00f6rk's parent label One Little Indian Records, which released her &lt;a href=\"HK119%20%28album%29\"&gt;debut album&lt;/a&gt; in 2006. HK119 and Bj\u00f6rk appeared in a joint interview in \"&lt;a href=\"Dazed\"&gt;Dazed &amp; Confused&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine in 2006, in which Bj\u00f6rk stated about HK119's work: \"It's unique. Even if I gave you $3 million, you couldn't improve on it... [Its] simplicity is [its] strength.\" HK119 later released her albums \"&lt;a href=\"Fast%2C%20Cheap%20and%20Out%20of%20Control%20%28album%29\"&gt;Fast, Cheap and Out of Control&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2008 and \"Imaginature\" in 2013, both on One Little Indian Records.\nIn 2009, Bj\u00f6rk used her website and various radio interviews to promote two more new acts. The first was fellow Icelandic musician &lt;a href=\"%C3%93l%C3%B6f%20Arnalds\"&gt;\u00d3l\u00f6f Arnalds&lt;/a&gt;, who is also a member of the Icelandic &lt;a href=\"folktronica\"&gt;folktronica&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"m%C3%BAm\"&gt;m\u00fam&lt;/a&gt;. In 2006, Arnalds released her debut solo album \"&lt;a href=\"Vi%C3%B0%20Og%20Vi%C3%B0\"&gt;Vi\u00f0 Og Vi\u00f0&lt;/a&gt;\" in Iceland. Bj\u00f6rk mentioned Arnalds among her favourite recent new acts during a radio interview, and encouraged One Little Indian Records to reissue the album in the UK and Europe in 2009. Bj\u00f6rk also praised the works of English artist &lt;a href=\"Micachu\"&gt;Micachu&lt;/a&gt; and Syrian vocalist &lt;a href=\"Omar%20Souleyman\"&gt;Omar Souleyman&lt;/a&gt;. She later used her website to host the premiere of &lt;a href=\"Micachu\"&gt;Micachu&lt;/a&gt;'s debut video for &lt;a href=\"Rough%20Trade%20Records\"&gt;Rough Trade Records&lt;/a&gt;, \"Turn Me Well.\"\nAwards and nominations.\nOn 26 April 1997, Bj\u00f6rk received the award of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Falcon\"&gt;Order of the Falcon&lt;/a&gt;."
