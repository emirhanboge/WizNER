    "text": "There have been several designs for a &lt;a href=\"peace\"&gt;peace&lt;/a&gt; flag.\nThe Peace Flag initiative.\n\"The Peace Flag\" is an initiative that aims to unify all nations underneath one common symbol on &lt;a href=\"International%20Day%20of%20Peace\"&gt;International Peace Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile there are various icons of peace \u2013 the olive branch, the dove \u2013 there is no official world flag of peace adopted by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. That\u2019s why this initiative has proposed that, for one day a year on 21 September, every country raises an all-white version of their national flag to represent that we are all one. In 2013, embassies of Colombia, Equatorial Guinea and Ecuador in London officially agreed to support The Peace Flag initiative by raising a colorless version of their respective flags on September 21. The initiative was nominated for a White Pencil in 2012 at &lt;a href=\"D%26amp%3BAD\"&gt;D&amp;AD&lt;/a&gt; for its contribution towards peace, in support of Peace One Day.\nWhite-bordered national flag.\nThe &lt;a href=\"white%20flag\"&gt;white flag&lt;/a&gt; is recognized in most of the world as a flag of surrender, truce or ceasefire. The first mention of a white flag used in this context is made during the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25\u2013220). A white flag was also used by the anti-war movement during the &lt;a href=\"US%20Civil%20War\"&gt;US Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in 1861.\nIn 1891, the third &lt;a href=\"Peace%20congress%23Universal%20Peace%20Congress\"&gt;Universal Peace Congress&lt;/a&gt; in Rome devised a generalized Peace Flag design, which was simply the home nation's flag bordered in white to signify non-violent conflict resolution. This was used (although not officially adopted) by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Peace%20Society\"&gt;American Peace Society&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Peace%20Union\"&gt;Universal Peace Union&lt;/a&gt;. It was designed by Henry Pettit.\nThe International Council of Women's banner.\nIn the 1890s, expatriate American Cora Slocomb di Brazza Savorgnan, the Countess Di Brazza, invented a universal peace flag with three upright bands: yellow, purple, and white, which became the peace flag of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Peace%20Bureau\"&gt;International Peace Bureau&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, there was a complicated symbol on the middle band: \"a shield ... surmounted by a man's and a woman's clasped hands, sustained by a pair of dove wings with a white star aloft; on the shield can appear any device chosen by the association adopting the flag, or simply the number of enrollment among the users of the flag, or the motto \"Pro Concordia Labor\" (For Peace I Work), or this motto may be placed upon a ribbon on the flag beneath the shield, or on a streamer (white) from the flag staff (blue, the color of promise) surmounted by a star with the motto of the association or individual using the flag upon the other white streamer\".\nThis flag was adopted by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Council%20of%20Women\"&gt;International Council of Women&lt;/a&gt; in 1896. In 1904, it lost the complicated design and became a simple tricolor.\nThe Earth flag.\nJames William van Kirk, a Methodist minister from &lt;a href=\"Youngstown%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Youngstown, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; designed the first world peace flag of the Earth, using rainbow stripes, stars and a globe. In 1913 and 1929, he made a peace tour through Europe with his flag. He traveled around the world arguing for \"the brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of God\".\nThe Universal Peace Congress eventually came to adopt Kirk's flag as its official World Peace Flag, and it was subsequently adopted by the American Peace Society as well as other groups. It consisted of \"the earth on a blue field covered with white stars; a white band crossed the globe and to the left was broken up into a spectrum representing the variations of the human race\u2014different, but united in peace\". The flag also shows 46 stars surrounding the globe and the spectrum.\nIn 1938, Kirk authored an autobiography, \"Stranger than fiction : four times around the world, designer of world flag, a world builder, at 80 years makes a new start in life\".\nThe Banner of Peace.\nThe \"banner of peace\" is a symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Roerich%20Pact\"&gt;Roerich Pact&lt;/a&gt;. This pact was the first international treaty dedicated to the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments. It was signed on April 15, 1935. The banner of peace was proposed by &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Roerich\"&gt;Nicholas Roerich&lt;/a&gt; for an international pact for the protection of culture values.\nThe Rainbow flag.\nThe most common recent design is a &lt;a href=\"rainbow%20flag\"&gt;rainbow flag&lt;/a&gt; representing peace, first used in &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"peace%20march\"&gt;peace march&lt;/a&gt; in 1961. The flag was inspired by similar multi-coloured flags used in demonstrations against &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20weapon\"&gt;nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt;s. A previous version had featured a dove drawn by &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Picasso\"&gt;Pablo Picasso&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most common variety has seven colours\u2014&lt;a href=\"purple\"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blue\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"azure%20%28color%29\"&gt;azure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"green\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"yellow\"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orange%20%28color%29\"&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"red\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and is emblazoned in bold with the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; word \"PACE\", meaning \"peace\".\nIt became popular with the \"Pace da tutti i balconi\" (\"peace from every balcony\") campaign in 2002, started as a protest against the impending war in the world. The flag was flown from balconies in all Italian &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; by citizens against the war. Its use spread to other countries too, and the Italian \"Pace\" was sometimes, but not everywhere, replaced with the corresponding translation in the local languages.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Amnesty%20International\"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, producer &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Belsito\"&gt;Franco Belsito&lt;/a&gt; had produced about 1,000 flags per year for 18 years, and suddenly had to cope with a demand in the range of the millions.\nCommon variations include moving the purple stripe down below the azure one, and adding a white stripe on top.\nThe seven-color peace flag is not to be confused with the similar six-color &lt;a href=\"Rainbow%20flag%20%28LGBT%20movement%29\"&gt;gay pride flag&lt;/a&gt;, which does not have &lt;a href=\"azure%20%28color%29\"&gt;azure&lt;/a&gt; (it has &lt;a href=\"Turquoise%20%28color%29\"&gt;turquoise&lt;/a&gt;) and the colors are in opposite order: with red at the top.\n&lt;a href=\"Robert%20A.%20Heinlein\"&gt;Robert A. Heinlein&lt;/a&gt;, in his 1947 short story \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Hills%20of%20Earth\"&gt;The Green Hills of Earth&lt;/a&gt;\", referred to \"Terra's [Earth's] rainbow banner\".\nThe largest peace flag.\nThe first large peace flag was made in &lt;a href=\"Lecce\"&gt;Lecce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salento\"&gt;Salento&lt;/a&gt;, Italy by the association \"GPace - Youth for peace\" on Saturday, 14 November 2009. It was 21 m wide and 40 m long. Three years later this record was broken. On September the 21st 2012 the Belgian Peace Organisation &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.vrede.be/\"&gt;Vrede vzw&lt;/a&gt;, Vredeshuis Ghent and five city schools unfolded the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5VzXEtQN8x4\"&gt;worlds largest peace flag&lt;/a&gt; (30 m wide and 50 m long) in the historic center of &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;. The action aimed to reinforce the demand to disarm in order to make room for sustainable development."
