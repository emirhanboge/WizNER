    "text": "A cervical pregnancy is an &lt;a href=\"ectopic%20pregnancy\"&gt;ectopic pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; that has implanted in the uterine &lt;a href=\"endocervix\"&gt;endocervix&lt;/a&gt;. Such a pregnancy typically aborts within the first &lt;a href=\"pregnancy\"&gt;trimester&lt;/a&gt;, however, if it is implanted closer to the uterine cavity \u2013 a so-called cervico-isthmic pregnancy \u2013 it may continue longer. &lt;a href=\"Placenta\"&gt;Placenta&lt;/a&gt;l removal in a cervical pregnancy may result in major hemorrhage.\nDiagnosis.\nThe diagnosis is made in asymptomatic pregnant women either by inspection seeing a bluish discolored &lt;a href=\"cervix\"&gt;cervix&lt;/a&gt; or, more commonly, by &lt;a href=\"obstetric%20ultrasonography\"&gt;obstetric ultrasonography&lt;/a&gt;. A typical &lt;a href=\"non-specific%20symptom\"&gt;non-specific symptom&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"vaginal%20bleeding\"&gt;vaginal bleeding&lt;/a&gt; during pregnancy. Ultrasound will show the location of the &lt;a href=\"gestational%20sac\"&gt;gestational sac&lt;/a&gt; in the cervix, while the uterine cavity is \"empty\". Cervical pregnancy can be confused with a &lt;a href=\"miscarriage\"&gt;miscarriage&lt;/a&gt; when pregnancy tissue is passing through the cervix.\nHistologically the diagnosis has been made by &lt;a href=\"Isidor%20Rubin\"&gt;Rubin's&lt;/a&gt; criteria on the surgical specimen: cervical glands are opposite the &lt;a href=\"trophoblast\"&gt;trophoblast&lt;/a&gt;ic tissue, the trophoblastic attachment is below the entrance of the uterine vessels to the uterus or the anterior peritoneal reflection, and fetal elements are absent from the uterine corpus. As many pregnancies today are diagnosed early and no hysterectomy is performed, Rubin's criteria can often not be applied.\nManagement.\nTrue cervical pregnancies tend to abort; if, however, the pregnancy is located higher in the canal and the placenta finds support in the uterine cavity, it can go past the first trimester. With the placenta being implanted abnormally, extensive vaginal bleeding can be expected at time of delivery and placental removal. While early cervical pregnancies may abort spontaneously or can be managed with excision, D&amp;C, suturing, electrocautery, and tamponading, by medication such as &lt;a href=\"methotrexate\"&gt;methotrexate&lt;/a&gt;, and/or by &lt;a href=\"uterine%20artery%20embolization\"&gt;uterine artery embolization&lt;/a&gt;, a more advanced pregnancy may require a &lt;a href=\"hysterectomy\"&gt;hysterectomy&lt;/a&gt; to control bleeding. The more advanced the pregnancy, the higher the risk for major bleeding necessitating a hysterectomy.\nOn very rare occasions, a cervical pregnancy results in the birth of a live baby; typically, the pregnancy is in the upper part of the cervical canal and manages to extend into the lower part of the uterine cavity.\nA cervical pregnancy can develop together with a normal intrauterine pregnancy; such a &lt;a href=\"heterotopic%20pregnancy\"&gt;heterotopic pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; will call for expert management as to not to endanger the intrauterine pregnancy.\nEpidemiology.\nThe incidence has been reported to be about 1:1,000 to 1:16,000 pregnancies.\nPregnancies involving the isthmus \u2013 the segment of the &lt;a href=\"uterus\"&gt;uterus&lt;/a&gt; between the cervix and the fundus \u2013 are more common than true cervical pregnancies. While in many situations the cause of the abnormal &lt;a href=\"Implantation%20%28human%20embryo%29\"&gt;implantation&lt;/a&gt; remains unclear, there is evidence to link the development of cervical pregnancy to uterine instrumentation, specifically repeated D&amp;Cs (&lt;a href=\"dilatation%20and%20curettage\"&gt;dilatation and curettage&lt;/a&gt;). Cervical pregnancies are to be distinguished from pregnancies that start from an implantation in a scar of a previous &lt;a href=\"cesarean%20section\"&gt;cesarean section&lt;/a&gt;, so-called \"scar pregnancies\"."
