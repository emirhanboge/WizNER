    "text": "The 2013 Sunshine Tour was the 14th season of professional &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; tournaments since the southern Africa based &lt;a href=\"Sunshine%20Tour\"&gt;Sunshine Tour&lt;/a&gt; was relaunched in 2000, and the 7th since the tour switched a calendar-based season in 2007. The Sunshine Tour represents the highest level of competition for male &lt;a href=\"professional%20golfer\"&gt;professional golfer&lt;/a&gt;s in the region.\nThe tour is based predominantly in &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; with other events being held in neighbouring countries, including &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swaziland\"&gt;Swaziland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zambia\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Namibia\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSchedule.\nThe table below shows the schedule of events for the 2013 Sunshine Tour season. As usual, the tour consisted of two distinct parts, commonly referred to as the \"Summer Swing\" and the \"Winter Swing\". Tournaments held during the Summer Swing generally have much higher prize funds, attract stronger fields, and until 2012 were the only tournaments on the tour to carry world ranking points, with some events being co-sanctioned with the &lt;a href=\"European%20Tour\"&gt;European Tour&lt;/a&gt;. Since the tour switched to a calendar-based season, this part of the tour has been split in two, with some events being held at the start of the year, and the remainder in November and December. Beginning in 2012, all events carry world ranking points, with the \"Winter Swing\" 72-hole events having a minimum of 6 points and the 54-hole events having a minimum of 4 points, compared with the 14 point minimum for the \"Summer Swing\" events.\nPrize funds shown do not count directly towards the Order of Merit. The number in brackets after each winner's name is the number of official money Sunshine Tour events he had won up to and including that tournament. This information is only shown for Sunshine Tour members.\nOrder of Merit.\nThis shows the final Order of Merit leaders.\n&lt;a href=\"Charl%20Schwartzel\"&gt;Charl Schwartzel&lt;/a&gt; (5.7 million) and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Sterne%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Richard Sterne&lt;/a&gt; (2.5 million) did not play the minimum number of tournaments required (eight) to be ranked.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//sst.ocs-sport.com/tic/tmoom.cgi%3Foom%3DFT~imp%3Dn~lspos%3Dn~dc%3DN~bdlink%3DY~season%3D213S~style%3D00~groupties%3DY~pr%3DN~textout%3DN~bordersize%3D1~fontsize%3D%2A~winfocus%3DY~\"&gt;Full list&lt;/a&gt;"
