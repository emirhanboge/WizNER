    "text": "Byron Aldemar Moreno Ruales (born November 23 1969) is an Ecuadorian former &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Referee%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;referee&lt;/a&gt; who served in the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20referee\"&gt;International Referee&lt;/a&gt; from 1996 to 2003.\nRefereeing career.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2002 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; Moreno refereed the &lt;a href=\"2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23South%20Korea%20vs%20Italy\"&gt;round of 16 match&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and co-hosts &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; on June 18. Following Italy's elimination from the tournament after a 2\u20131 extra-time loss, Moreno's performance was criticized for several decisions: he awarded South Korea a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt; in the first half, and later disallowed a possible golden goal by &lt;a href=\"Damiano%20Tommasi\"&gt;Damiano Tommasi&lt;/a&gt; for offside, as well as showing a second yellow card to &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Totti\"&gt;Francesco Totti&lt;/a&gt; for an arguable dive in South Korea's penalty area in extra-time while he was 40 yards away from the play.\nIn September 2002, while seeking election to the &lt;a href=\"Quito\"&gt;Quito&lt;/a&gt; City Council, Moreno was suspended for twenty matches and investigated by Ecuadorian football authorities. This came after he made timekeeping errors in a match he officiated between &lt;a href=\"Liga%20Deportiva%20Universitaria%20%28Quito%29\"&gt;Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Quito&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barcelona%20Sporting%20Club\"&gt;Barcelona Sporting Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; also investigated him due to controversies \"...in Japan, Italy and South America over the past few months\". \nIn May 2003, in his third game back from his suspension, Moreno was again suspended, for one match, after he sent off three players from visiting &lt;a href=\"Sociedad%20Deportivo%20Quito\"&gt;Deportivo Quito&lt;/a&gt; in a 1\u20131 draw at &lt;a href=\"Club%20Deportivo%20Cuenca\"&gt;Deportivo Cuenca&lt;/a&gt;. He retired the following month, blaming low performance marks for his retirement.\nLegal trouble.\nMoreno was arrested on September 21, 2010 at &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport\"&gt;John F. Kennedy International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in New York City while trying to smuggle in six kilograms (over thirteen pounds) of &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt;, which was hidden in his underwear. In January 2011, he pleaded guilty to the charges in a New York courthouse, facing a possible ten years in prison. On September 23, 2011, Moreno was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison on the heroin smuggling charges.\nHe was released from prison 26 months later and returned to Ecuador."
