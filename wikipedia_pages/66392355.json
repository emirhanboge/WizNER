The sixteen participating national teams were required to submit squads of 18 players \u2013 of which two have to be goalkeepers \u2013 by 30 June 2021, 23 days prior to the opening match of the tournament. Additionally, teams could name a maximum of four alternate players, numbered from 19 to 22. The alternate list could contain at most three outfielders, as at least one slot was reserved for a goalkeeper. In the event that a player on the submitted squad list suffered an injury or illness, that player would have been able to be replaced by one of the players in the alternate list. Only players in these squads were planned to be eligible to take part in the tournament. On 2 July, &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that there was a change for the 2020 Olympics, allowing all 22 players named to be available on the roster, with 18 being named for each match. This change was implemented due to the challenges of the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The official squad lists were released by FIFA on 7 July 2021.\nThe age listed for each player is on 22 July 2021, the first day of the tournament. The numbers of caps and goals listed for each player do not include any matches played after the start of the tournament. The club listed is the club for which the player last played a competitive match prior to the tournament. The nationality for each club reflects the national association (not the league) to which the club is affiliated. A flag is included for coaches who are of a different nationality than their own national team.\nGroup A.\nFrance.\n&lt;section begin=FRA /&gt;&lt;a href=\"France%20national%20under-23%20football%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;'s initial final squad was announced on 25 June 2021.
