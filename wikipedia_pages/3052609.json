    "text": "There is no formal &lt;a href=\"Scouting\"&gt;Scouting&lt;/a&gt; organization yet in &lt;a href=\"Turkmenistan\"&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;, due to the &lt;a href=\"Politics%20of%20Turkmenistan\"&gt;political situation&lt;/a&gt; and because Turkmenistan refuses to join any organization because of its \"status of &lt;a href=\"Neutrality%20Arch\"&gt;permanent neutrality&lt;/a&gt;,\" which was accepted by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;United Nations General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; on December 12, 1995. The only widespread &lt;a href=\"outreach\"&gt;outreach&lt;/a&gt; activities for Turkmen children between ages 8 and 14 are 10- to 14-day &lt;a href=\"Summer%20camp\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt;s that do not provide any &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;al components, but organize some &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Turkmenistan\"&gt;cultural events&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"concert\"&gt;concert&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"poem\"&gt;poem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20dance\"&gt;dance competition&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWith the death of &lt;a href=\"Saparmurat%20Niyazov\"&gt;Saparmurat Niyazov&lt;/a&gt; on December 21, 2006, the situation may change, possibly opening for the expansion of Scouting.\nThere are, however, two &lt;a href=\"Scout%20troop\"&gt;Scout troop&lt;/a&gt;s active in the vicinity of the capital, &lt;a href=\"A%C5%9Fgabat\"&gt;A\u015fgabat&lt;/a&gt; and one recent attempt in &lt;a href=\"Da%C5%9Foguz\"&gt;Da\u015foguz&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs far as is known, Scouting was not introduced to the region during the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Central%20Asia%23Return%20of%20indigenous%20rule\"&gt;khanate period of the pre-Soviet era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe concept of Scouting is at least marginally understood in Turkmenistan, as Turkmenistan issued &lt;a href=\"postage%20stamps\"&gt;postage stamps&lt;/a&gt; for the October 7, 1997 90th anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scout%20Association\"&gt;Boy Scouts&lt;/a&gt;; as well as other Turkmen postage stamps with Scout motifs and showing a heavy, darkish colored &lt;a href=\"fleur-de-lis\"&gt;fleur-de-lis&lt;/a&gt;. This does not necessarily mean complete understanding, and the stamps may well simply have been produced for the sake of marketability, but it shows that the concept of Scouting exists at some level in Turkmenistan.\nWith the 1991 &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985-1991%29\"&gt;breakup&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, it was suggested that the &lt;a href=\"T%C3%BCrkiye%20%C4%B0zcilik%20Federasyonu\"&gt;T\u00fcrkiye \u0130zcilik Federasyonu&lt;/a&gt; assist in the creation of Scouting movements in the Turkic &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt;n republics of &lt;a href=\"Organization%20of%20the%20Scout%20Movement%20of%20Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scouting%20in%20Kyrgyzstan\"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt;, Turkmenistan and &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Association%20of%20Uzbekistan\"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;, but it is uncertain if this plan ever materialized. In &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; there is the Turkmen Federation of Scouts (\"T\u00fcrkmen Izcilik Federasyonu\") founded in 2010 and based in &lt;a href=\"Kirkuk\"&gt;Kirkuk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Motto\"&gt;Scout Motto&lt;/a&gt; is \"Daima H\u00e4zir\", meaning \"Be Prepared\" in Turkmen, similar to &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijani%20language\"&gt;Azeri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; mottoes. The Turkmen noun for a single Scout is \"Skaut\" or \"\u0130zci\". Given &lt;a href=\"Renaming%20of%20Turkmen%20months%20and%20days%20of%20week%2C%202002\"&gt;recent flux&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Turkmen%20language\"&gt;Turkmen language&lt;/a&gt;, an entirely different name may be decided upon."
