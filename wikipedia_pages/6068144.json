    "text": "Yelnya () is a &lt;a href=\"types%20of%20inhabited%20localities%20in%20Russia\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"administrative%20center\"&gt;administrative center&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yelninsky%20District\"&gt;Yelninsky District&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Smolensk%20Oblast\"&gt;Smolensk Oblast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, located on the &lt;a href=\"Desna%20River\"&gt;Desna River&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Smolensk\"&gt;Smolensk&lt;/a&gt;, the administrative center of the &lt;a href=\"oblast\"&gt;oblast&lt;/a&gt;. Population: \nEtymology.\nYelnya's name is likely related to the Russian word \"\"('yel'\", lit. \"&lt;a href=\"fir\"&gt;fir&lt;/a&gt; tree\") or \"\" (\"yelan'\", lit. \"land cleared from forest\").\nHistory.\nIt was first mentioned in the historical documents in 1150 when according to the order of &lt;a href=\"knyaz\"&gt;knyaz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rostislav%20I%20of%20Kiev\"&gt;Rostislav of Smolensk&lt;/a&gt; it was to pay a tax of four &lt;a href=\"grzywna%20%28unit%29\"&gt;grivnas&lt;/a&gt; and a fox skin.\nThe settlement shared the history of the &lt;a href=\"Smolensk\"&gt;Smolensk&lt;/a&gt; lands\u2014it paid duty to the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Horde\"&gt;Golden Horde&lt;/a&gt;, then was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;. It was returned to Russia with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Smolensk%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Smolensk Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt; at the close of the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Polish%20War%20%281654-1667%29\"&gt;Russo-Polish War&lt;/a&gt; of 1654\u20131667. In 1776, it was granted town status and became the seat of an &lt;a href=\"uyezd\"&gt;uyezd&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1812, during the &lt;a href=\"French%20invasion%20of%20Russia\"&gt;French invasion of Russia&lt;/a&gt;, Yelnya became an important center of the &lt;a href=\"partisan%20%28military%29\"&gt;partisan&lt;/a&gt; movement. During the counter-offensive campaign, &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Kutuzov\"&gt;Mikhail Kutuzov&lt;/a&gt;'s headquarters were located here.\nIn October 1928, Yelninsky Uyezd was abolished and split between &lt;a href=\"Smolensky%20Uyezd\"&gt;Smolensky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roslavlsky%20Uyezd\"&gt;Roslavlsky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vyazemsky%20Uyezd\"&gt;Vyazemsky Uyezd&lt;/a&gt;s. On 12 July 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Yelninsky District with the administrative center in Yelnya was established. The district belonged to &lt;a href=\"Smolensk%20Okrug\"&gt;Smolensk Okrug&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Oblast\"&gt;Western Oblast&lt;/a&gt;. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On 27 September 1937 Western Oblast was abolished and split between &lt;a href=\"Oryol%20Oblast\"&gt;Oryol&lt;/a&gt; and Smolensk Oblasts. Yelninsky District was transferred to Smolensk Oblast.\nDuring World War II, Yelnya was a place of several important battles. On 30 August 1941, it became the place of the &lt;a href=\"Yelnya%20Offensive\"&gt;Yelnya Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, the first successful offensive operation of Soviet troops in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Patriotic%20War\"&gt;Great Patriotic War&lt;/a&gt;, although they suffered heavy losses taking the town. In 1942, Yelninsky District became a part of the so-called \"Dorogobuzh Partisan Krai\". The German garrison in the town was not able to control the rural territories which were effectively under the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20partisans\"&gt;partisan&lt;/a&gt; control. In March 1942, partisans even liberated the town, killing more than a thousand German troops, but in three days on March\u00a018, 1942 they were forced to retreat back to the forests.\n289 Jews used to live in Yelnya in 1939 but in March 1942, 230 Jews were shot by German units in a &lt;a href=\"Einsatzgruppen\"&gt;mass execution&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 1943, Yelnya played the key part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Smolensk%20%281943%29%23Yelnya%20offensive\"&gt;Battle of Smolensk&lt;/a&gt;. On August\u00a030, Germans were forced to abandon Yelnya, sustaining heavy casualties. This started a full-scale German retreat from the area. By September\u00a03, Soviet forces reached the eastern shore of the &lt;a href=\"Dnieper%20River\"&gt;Dnieper&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdministrative and municipal status.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Administrative%20divisions\"&gt;framework of administrative divisions&lt;/a&gt;, Yelnya serves as the &lt;a href=\"administrative%20center\"&gt;administrative center&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yelninsky%20District\"&gt;Yelninsky District&lt;/a&gt;. As an administrative division, it is, together with ten &lt;a href=\"types%20of%20inhabited%20localities%20in%20Russia\"&gt;rural localities&lt;/a&gt;, incorporated within Yelninsky District as Yelninskoye &lt;a href=\"Town%20of%20district%20significance\"&gt;Urban Settlement&lt;/a&gt;. As a &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Municipal%20divisions\"&gt;municipal division&lt;/a&gt;, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Yelninsky Municipal District.\nEconomy.\nIndustry.\nThe town has a cheese factory, a large bakery, a brick factory, and a few sawmills.\nTransportation.\n&lt;a href=\"Yelnya%20railway%20station\"&gt;Yelnya railway station&lt;/a&gt; is on the railway connecting Smolensk and &lt;a href=\"Sukhinichi\"&gt;Sukhinichi&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Spas-Demensk\"&gt;Spas-Demensk&lt;/a&gt;. There is infrequent passenger navigation.\nYelnya is connected by roads with &lt;a href=\"Safonovo%2C%20Safonovsky%20District%2C%20Smolensk%20Oblast\"&gt;Safonovo&lt;/a&gt; (where it has access to the &lt;a href=\"M1%20highway%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;M1 highway&lt;/a&gt; connecting Moscow and Smolensk), with &lt;a href=\"Pochinok%2C%20Pochinkovsky%20District%2C%20Smolensk%20Oblast\"&gt;Pochinok&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href=\"Roslavl\"&gt;Roslavl&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture and recreation.\nThere is a local museum in Yelnya."
