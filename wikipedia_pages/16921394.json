    "text": "My Son, the Nut is the third &lt;a href=\"album\"&gt;album&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Sherman\"&gt;Allan Sherman&lt;/a&gt;, released by Warner Bros. Records in 1963. The album held the top spot on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Top%20200\"&gt;Billboard Top 200&lt;/a&gt; for nearly two months, from August 31 to October 25, 1963. It stayed on the charts for 140 weeks and sold 1.2 million copies. \"My Son, the Nut\" was also the last comedy album to hit #1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 for over half a century, until &lt;a href=\"%26quot%3BWeird%20Al%26quot%3B%20Yankovic\"&gt;\"Weird Al\" Yankovic&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Mandatory%20Fun\"&gt;Mandatory Fun&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2014.\nSherman's first two albums had been filled with &lt;a href=\"in-joke\"&gt;in-joke&lt;/a&gt;s about &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20culture\"&gt;Jewish culture&lt;/a&gt;. With his third album, his parodies became more generic."
