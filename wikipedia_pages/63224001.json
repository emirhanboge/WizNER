    "text": "AppValley is an independent American digital distribution service operated and trademarked by AppValley LLC. It serves as an alternative &lt;a href=\"app%20store\"&gt;app store&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; mobile operating system, which allows users to download &lt;a href=\"Application%20software\"&gt;applications&lt;/a&gt; that are not available on the &lt;a href=\"App%20Store%20%28iOS%29\"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, most commonly tweaked \"++\" apps, &lt;a href=\"jailbreak\"&gt;jailbreak&lt;/a&gt; apps, and apps including paid apps on the &lt;a href=\"app%20store\"&gt;app store&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegality.\nAppValley is among several services that violate enterprise developer certificates from &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Inc.\"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The terms under which these are granted make clear that they are for companies who wish to distribute apps to their employees. AppValley uses these certificates to distribute software directly to non-employees, thereby bypassing the &lt;a href=\"App%20Store%20%28iOS%29\"&gt;AppStore&lt;/a&gt;. AppValley's conduct had implications in U.S. sanctioned markets like &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, Iraq, &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, which have all been subject to commercial &lt;a href=\"Economic%20sanctions\"&gt;sanctions&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the software offered by AppValley and other services is &lt;a href=\"pirated%20software\"&gt;pirated software&lt;/a&gt;, including paid apps on the app store and premium versions of &lt;a href=\"Instagram\"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spotify\"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Go\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Go&lt;/a&gt;, and others. For instance, AppValley distributes an ad-free version of the music streaming app &lt;a href=\"Spotify\"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; even on the free tier.\nHistory.\nThe website was founded in May 2017, releasing late that month with a very basic version of the app. There were less than 100 apps available for download at this time. On Jan 19, 2018, a new version dubbed AppValley 2.0 was released bringing dark mode, more categories, a search, and a much faster interface. On February 14, 2019, a Chinese partner \"Jason Wu\" allegedly took control of the main Twitter account and domain, causing the original AppValley developers to migrate to the domain and the &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; account handle @App_Valley_vip. AppValley LLC is an alternative to Apple Appstore where &lt;a href=\"Application%20developer\"&gt;app developers&lt;/a&gt; can publish their applications.\nFeatures.\nAppValley is a mobile app installer which can also support &lt;a href=\"iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; version that can be installed and downloaded on the mobile or the devices of the people who wish to get access to many different applications available. AppValley also contains apps that have been modified or tweaked for user preferences, and allows the user to by pass national restrictions on the use of apps, without having to resort to &lt;a href=\"Jailbreak%20%28computer%20science%29\"&gt;jailbreaking&lt;/a&gt;. As of June 2, 2020, there are over 1300 apps available for download."
