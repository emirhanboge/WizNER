    "text": "The Porsche Panamera is a mid/full-sized &lt;a href=\"luxury%20vehicle\"&gt;luxury vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"E-segment\"&gt;E-segment&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;) manufactured by the &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; automobile manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Porsche\"&gt;Porsche&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href=\"front-engine%20design\"&gt;front-engined&lt;/a&gt; and has a &lt;a href=\"rear-wheel-drive\"&gt;rear-wheel-drive&lt;/a&gt; layout, with &lt;a href=\"all-wheel%20drive\"&gt;all-wheel drive&lt;/a&gt; versions also available.\nThe production version of the Porsche Panamera was unveiled at the 13th &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shanghai\"&gt;Auto Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; International Automobile Show in &lt;a href=\"Shanghai%2C%20China\"&gt;Shanghai, China&lt;/a&gt;, in April 2009. In 2011, hybrid and diesel versions were launched. In April 2013, a facelift to the Panamera was announced, making its debut again at the Shanghai Auto Show. A &lt;a href=\"plug-in%20hybrid\"&gt;plug-in hybrid&lt;/a&gt; version, the Panamera S E-Hybrid, was released in the U.S. market in November 2013. The Panamera range received a re-design in 2016.\nConcept and description.\nThe Panamera's name is derived, like the &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20Carrera\"&gt;Porsche Carrera&lt;/a&gt; lineage, from the &lt;a href=\"Carrera%20Panamericana\"&gt;Carrera Panamericana&lt;/a&gt; race. The Panamera is generally considered to be the long-awaited fruit of Porsche's &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20989\"&gt;989&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"concept%20vehicle\"&gt;concept vehicle&lt;/a&gt; from the late 1980s.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20Cayenne\"&gt;Porsche Cayenne&lt;/a&gt; SUV (which has become the marque's best-selling vehicle), the Panamera upset many Porsche purists, since it was seen as an attempt to broaden Porsche's appeal beyond that of hardcore fans. The Panamera ran contrary to the company's signature offerings, particularly its light two-door rear-engine sports cars like the &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20911\"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt;. The Panamera on the other hand is considered a full-size luxury car, weighing nearly , with four doors, and its engine mounted in the front. The Panamera's appearance with its long hood and rear hatch bears resemblance to a stretched 911. The 911 has a sparse interior, as it was focused on raw performance, while the Panamera has a sumptuous interior loaded with modern technological amenities and expensive leather upholstery.\nProduction.\nEngines are first assembled in &lt;a href=\"Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt;, and the car's &lt;a href=\"Coachwork\"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; is built, painted and assembled in &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20Cayenne\"&gt;Cayenne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20Macan\"&gt;Macan&lt;/a&gt;. From 2009 to 2016, the bodies were built at the &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20Volkswagen%20Group%20factories\"&gt;Volkswagen Group facility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hannover\"&gt;Hannover&lt;/a&gt;.\nProduction began in April 2009, one month after its debut in the &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai Motor Show&lt;/a&gt; in China.\nFirst generation (970 Chassis G1; 2010\u20132016).\nThe V8-powered Panamera S, 4S, and Turbo models were the first versions that debuted in 2009. In addition to the 4.8L Twin Turbo V8 powered models, Porsche launched two further models in 2010: the Panamera and Panamera 4 which are both powered by 3.0-litre and 3.6-litre V6 engines producing .\nBeing derived from the V8 engine of the Panamera S and Panamera 4S, the V6 retains the V8's technologies like &lt;a href=\"Fuel%20injection\"&gt;Direct Fuel Injection&lt;/a&gt;, infinitely variable intake camshaft adjustment with variable valve lift (&lt;a href=\"VarioCam%20Plus\"&gt;VarioCam Plus&lt;/a&gt;), an on-demand oil pump, water cooling with thermal management, a variable intake manifold, as well as integrated &lt;a href=\"dry%20sump%20lubrication\"&gt;dry sump lubrication&lt;/a&gt; with two-stage extraction of oil, and an Auto Start-Stop function (only with the PDK transmission). Turbo version uses active aerodynamics with a multi-stage, adjustable rear &lt;a href=\"Spoiler%20%28automotive%29\"&gt;spoiler&lt;/a&gt;. Optional Sports Chrono Packages include a Sport Plus button, which has tighter damping and air springs, and lowers the car's body by .\nIn 2011, the Panamera S Hybrid, Diesel, Turbo S, and GTS variants were added to the range. The GTS achieves a &lt;a href=\"Formula%20One%20car%23Lateral%20acceleration\"&gt;lateral acceleration&lt;/a&gt; of 0.96g.\nThe Panamera, S, Hybrid and Diesel models are &lt;a href=\"rear-wheel%20drive\"&gt;rear-wheel drive&lt;/a&gt;, while the Panamera 4, 4S, and GTS have the same &lt;a href=\"four-wheel%20drive\"&gt;four-wheel drive&lt;/a&gt; system as the Turbo and Turbo S, called Porsche Traction Management (PTM).\nThe Panamera featured &lt;a href=\"Adaptive%20air%20suspension\"&gt;Adaptive air suspension&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20Dynamic%20Chassis%20Control\"&gt;Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"PDCC\"&gt;PDCC&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"active%20anti-roll%20bar\"&gt;active anti-roll bar&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20Active%20Suspension%20Management\"&gt;Porsche Active Suspension Management&lt;/a&gt; (PASM).\nTransmissions.\nThe newly introduced &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20ZF%20transmissions%237-speed%20dual%20clutch\"&gt;ZF 7-speed&lt;/a&gt; PDK &lt;a href=\"dual-clutch%20transmission%23Porsche\"&gt;dual clutch transmission&lt;/a&gt; was standard on the Panamera 4, 4S and Turbo models. \nThe addition of the optional sport chrono package provided faster acceleration times. \nThe S Hybrid and Diesel models had an &lt;a href=\"Aisin\"&gt;Aisin&lt;/a&gt;-supplied eight-speed automatic transmission called the Tiptronic S.\nIn some markets between 2009-2013 Porsche offered 6-speed manual transmission for the V6 N/A and V8 N/A, all with rear wheel drive. Global production with the 6-speed manual was only 50 with V6 and 96 with V8.\nPanamera Turbo S.\nThe engine of the Panamera Turbo S features larger &lt;a href=\"turbochargers\"&gt;turbochargers&lt;/a&gt; than the standard Panamera Turbo's 4.8-litre V8, as well as high-pressure fuel injection, and aluminium-alloy pistons. The piston rings are coated in a low-friction surface to help eke out even more performance. The Panamera Turbo S accelerates to in 3.3 seconds with launch control engaged. Roll-on acceleration should be more impressive, changes to the PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplung) gearbox allow for faster gearshifts, and the alleged 27.7mpg fuel economy is no worse than the less powerful Panamera Turbo.\nPanamera S Hybrid.\nIn 2008, Porsche AG announced the development of a parallel &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20vehicle\"&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt; system for the Panamera, and in February 2011, Porsche unveiled the Panamera S Hybrid. Using the same drivetrain seen in the &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20Cayenne%23Hybrid\"&gt;Cayenne S Hybrid&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an Audi-sourced supercharged 3.0-litre V6 engine producing along with an electric motor rated at , as well as the Cayenne's 8-speed Tiptronic S transmission\u2014the Panamera S Hybrid could accelerate from 0\u2013 in 6.0\u00a0seconds. The Panamera S Hybrid produced only 193\u00a0grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre, rendering it the most environment friendly car in the then entire Porsche model range, while still maintaining a top speed of .\nDeliveries began in the United States in 2011, and cumulative sales reached 684 units through March 2013. The &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency\"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; (EPA) rated the &lt;a href=\"fuel%20economy%20in%20automobiles\"&gt;fuel economy&lt;/a&gt; for the 2013/2012 &lt;a href=\"model%20year\"&gt;model year&lt;/a&gt; Panamera Hybrid at for city driving, for highway, and combined.\nPanamera Diesel.\nThe Panamera Diesel was launched in May 2011. The vehicle utilized the same Audi 3.0L V6 engine used in the &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20Cayenne%23Second%20generation%20%282011%29\"&gt;Cayenne Diesel&lt;/a&gt;, which was itself a tuned carryover of an existing engine. The engine had a power output of . The car was capable of accelerating from 0\u2013 in 6.8 seconds and had a top speed of . It was also the most economical Porsche in the then entire Porsche vehicle lineage, consuming just 6.3 litres per 100 kilometres (37 US MPG/45 UK MPG).\nSpecial editions.\nIn October 2012, Porsche introduced the Panamera Platinum Edition. The exterior of the Panamera Platinum Edition was enveloped in one of five basic colours \u2013 black, white, basalt black, carbon grey metallic, and mahogany metallic. It included more standard equipment, larger wheels, and an exclusive interior leather combination of luxor beige and black. It was be offered with rear and all wheel drive layouts, and had a acceleration time of under 5.8\u00a0seconds or faster on all variants. Exclusive equipment included the special interior combination, platinum rear overhang and front lower grille, platinum door sills, and platinum mirrors. The finalizing touch to this special edition included an exclusive set of 19-inch Panamera Turbo alloy wheels with the red, black, and gold Porsche crest.\nIn March 2015, &lt;a href=\"Porsche\"&gt;Porsche&lt;/a&gt; announced that they were releasing a new special edition Panamera called the \"Panamera Edition\". The car is based on the base Panamera and includes high-gloss black trim strips outline the windows, 19-inch Panamera Turbo wheels with coloured centre caps, the sills were inscribed with the word \"Edition,\" and body-coloured &lt;a href=\"door%20handle\"&gt;door handle&lt;/a&gt;s were an additional add on when the customer chose the Porsche Entry &amp; Drive option. The Panamera Edition cost US$80,000.\n2013 facelift.\nPorsche announced its updated Panamera on 3 April 2013, with a scheduled formal launch at &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shanghai\"&gt;Auto Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;. The revised model can be identified by new front and rear bumpers. Technical changes included the addition of a new 3.0L twin-turbocharged Panamera S and a new E-Hybrid model. A long wheelbase version with an additional 150\u00a0mm was available for selected left-hand drive markets. The Turbo S version followed up in 2014. The long wheelbase versions were only available on 4S, Turbo, and Turbo S models.\nPanamera S E-Hybrid.\nAs part of the 2013 Panamera facelift, Porsche announced the introduction of a &lt;a href=\"plug-in%20hybrid\"&gt;plug-in hybrid&lt;/a&gt; model, the Panamera S E-Hybrid. The plug-in version was unveiled at the April 2013 &lt;a href=\"Shanghai%20Auto%20Show\"&gt;Shanghai Auto Show&lt;/a&gt;. The S E-Hybrid is powered by a electric motor, with a total system power of . Top speed amounted to in &lt;a href=\"all-electric%20mode\"&gt;all-electric mode&lt;/a&gt;, and acceleration from 0\u2013 took 5.8 seconds. The plug-in electric hybrid had a 9.4 &lt;a href=\"kWh\"&gt;kWh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lithium-ion%20battery\"&gt;lithium-ion battery&lt;/a&gt; pack capable of delivering a &lt;a href=\"all-electric%20range\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt; of more than under the &lt;a href=\"New%20European%20Driving%20Cycle\"&gt;New European Driving Cycle&lt;/a&gt; (NEDC) standard. The battery could be fully charged in approximately 2\u00bd hours from a 240 V power source. The Panamera plug-in hybrid reduce fuel consumption to , down from for the current Panamera hybrid, which translates to emissions of 71 g/km, down from 167 g/km for the current hybrid.\nIn November 2013, the UK Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) approved the eligibility of the Panamera S E-Hybrid for the &lt;a href=\"Plug-in%20Car%20Grant\"&gt;Plug-in Car Grant&lt;/a&gt; which entitles customers to a maximum purchase subsidy of (~ ). The plug-in hybrid was rated with a fuel economy of and CO2 emissions of 71 g/km.\nMarkets and sales.\nThe Panamera S E-Hybrid was released in the European market during the fourth quarter of 2013. Retail deliveries began in the U.S. in October 2013. , a total of 90 units were delivered in France, 86 units in the United States, 59 units in the Netherlands, 14 in Spain, and about 12 in Germany.\nIn the American market the 2014 &lt;a href=\"model%20year\"&gt;model year&lt;/a&gt; price starts at before any applicable &lt;a href=\"government%20incentives%20for%20plug-in%20electric%20vehicles\"&gt;government incentives&lt;/a&gt;. Since its introduction, 698 Panamera S E-Hybrids have been sold in the United States through August 2014. Global sales between January and August 2014 totaled over 1,500 units, presenting 9% of all Panamera models sold worldwide and 1.3% of all Porsche vehicles sold during this period.\nSecond generation (971 Chassis G2; 2017\u2013present).\nThe second generation Panamera was revealed on 28 June 2016 at a special event in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, Germany. Codenamed 971, it is longer, wider and taller than the first generation Panamera, with a longer wheelbase. The interior features a redesigned dashboard layout, with touch-sensitive surfaces replacing the previous generation's array of buttons. A centrally mounted tachometer also harks back to the 1955 Porsche 356 A.\nThe new car includes two seven-inch displays in place of the dials, as well as a 12.3-inch touchscreen featuring online sat-nav, Apple CarPlay integration and an updated voice control system. Under the &lt;a href=\"hood%20%28car%29\"&gt;bonnet&lt;/a&gt; is a new engine range, with only the Panamera 4S, 4S Diesel and flagship Turbo available from launch.\nIn March 2017, Porsche unveiled the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid, a &lt;a href=\"plug-in%20hybrid\"&gt;plug-in hybrid&lt;/a&gt; for the 2018 model year. The Turbo S E-Hybrid will receive the 4.0 L V8 engine from the Panamera Turbo, but will also be paired with an electric motor. Total system power will be , which makes it the third most powerful Porsche ever, after the &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20918%20Spyder\"&gt;918 Spyder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20911%20GT2%23991%20generation\"&gt;991 GT2RS&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 2017, Panamera 4S Diesel and Panamera Sport Turismo 4S Diesel were deleted from Porsche's German website and configurator. The German automotive magazine, &lt;a href=\"Auto%20motor%20und%20sport\"&gt;Auto motor und sport&lt;/a&gt;, discovered the higher than permittable amount, which is one-and-half times more than legal limit, during the exhaust testing. The issue was with &lt;a href=\"Selective%20catalytic%20reduction\"&gt;SCR catalysator&lt;/a&gt; and urea injection. In September 2018 Porsche announced that the company had decided to no longer offer diesel propulsion in future.\nExterior design.\nThe second-gen Panamera no longer has its predecessor's oft-criticized &lt;a href=\"hatchback\"&gt;hatchback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"station%20wagon\"&gt;wagon&lt;/a&gt; styling, with the tail of the new vehicle developing a clear link to the &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20911\"&gt;Porsche 911&lt;/a&gt; through the full width rear LED light bar, and the sharply creased tail and upper bumper. This improvement in design has helped clarify the model's identity as a sports-oriented &lt;a href=\"Grand%20tourer\"&gt;GT&lt;/a&gt; car.\nSport Turismo.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; a 5-door, &lt;a href=\"shooting-brake\"&gt;shooting-brake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"station%20wagon\"&gt;estate&lt;/a&gt; variant, called the Sport Turismo, will be offered alongside the &lt;a href=\"Hatchback%23Liftback\"&gt;liftback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sedan%20%28car%29\"&gt;saloon&lt;/a&gt;. It will also be available in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The Panamera Sport Turismo debuted in March 2017 at the Geneva Motor Show, and is currently available with the same engine range as the 4-door car. In September 2017 Porsche announced the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid Sport Turismo, the 5-door estate version of the flagship Turbo S E-Hybrid, which had previously only been available as a 4-door configuration. As of September 2017, the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid Sport Turismo is currently the world's most powerful stock estate car, besting the &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-AMG\"&gt;Mercedes-AMG&lt;/a&gt; E 63 S and the &lt;a href=\"Audi\"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt; RS6 Performance.\nReception.\nDespite the differences in dimensions and design, a reviewer noted that the Panamera's driving dynamics were close to that of the 911, and it \"seems to occupy the no-man's-land between really good &lt;a href=\"sports%20sedan\"&gt;sports sedan&lt;/a&gt;s and proper sports cars\", and so far the Panamera has won some comparison tests against other four-door performance cars on the market such as the &lt;a href=\"Maserati%20Quattroporte\"&gt;Maserati Quattroporte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Martin%20Rapide\"&gt;Aston Martin Rapide&lt;/a&gt;. Function was also praised, with the hatchback trunk, and the four-corner adaptive air suspension that retained superior handling while also providing a comfortable ride for public roads.\nUnlike most of the V8-engined contemporaries, all models of the Panamera avoid the US &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Guzzler%20Tax\"&gt;Gas Guzzler Tax&lt;/a&gt;. The V6-powered Panamera was also praised, as its smaller engine still retained respectable acceleration, and as it had improved handling over its V8 siblings, due to the engine being lighter by which gave the car better weight distribution.\nHowever, \"CAR\" magazine of the U.K. described the S model as lacking sportiness, which they attributed to their test car's being \"about as oriented to comfort as it\u2019s possible to get\" and called the Turbo model \"a missed opportunity on behalf of Porsche\" to be \"the world\u2019s first lightweight four seater\" as the top model weighs as much as an Audi S8.\nThe 30 November 2008 edition of &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Top%20Gear%20%282002%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Top Gear&lt;/a&gt;\" featured a look at the Panamera in its news section, with the three presenters being very critical of the look. In the June 2009 edition, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Hammond\"&gt;Richard Hammond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20May\"&gt;James May&lt;/a&gt; were seen driving the Panamera along the A30 in Devon, Great Britain. They were racing against a letter sent via &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Mail\"&gt;Royal Mail&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Isles%20of%20Scilly\"&gt;Isles of Scilly&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orkney%20Islands\"&gt;Orkney Islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nSales.\nAs of 2011, the largest national market was the United States with 6188 sold. Sales by cities: Los Angeles (890), New York (760), Hong Kong (300), Dubai (285), Tokyo (223), Munich (206), Moscow (203), Shanghai (188), Hamburg (117) and Berlin (108). Sales internationally by model variant: Panamera 4S (9394), Turbo (6171), S (4563) and V6 (2390\u2014introduced weeks earlier).\nIn 2012, U.S. sales of the Panamera totaled 7614 and Canadian sales of the Panamera totaled 422. In 2017, most of the Panameras sold in Northern Europe were hybrids.\nPublicity.\nOn 20 April 2007, a spy video of the Porsche Panamera became available on the Internet.\nIn September 2008, Porsche released the first teaser image for the Panamera. In early October 2008, an undisguised Panamera was captured on film in &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 28 November 2008, Porsche sent a mailer containing two photos of the Panamera which were labeled as \"the first official images of the Porsche Panamera\" with an invitation to have online access to Porsche USA's website.\nOn 19 April 2009, Porsche finally unveiled the Porsche Panamera sedan to the public at the 2009 Shanghai Auto Show. One of the highlights of the Panamera's debut was fitting the car in the freight elevator of the &lt;a href=\"Shanghai%20World%20Financial%20Center\"&gt;Shanghai World Financial Center&lt;/a&gt; and sending it to the skyscraper's 94th floor.\nAn estate version concept of the Panamera was introduced at the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Paris%20Motor%20Show\"&gt;2012 Paris Motor Show&lt;/a&gt; called Sport Turismo. Powered by an advancement of Porsche's current hybrid system utilized in the Panamera S Hybrid, the Sport Turismo concept's new \"e-Hybrid\" system uses the 333-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-litre V6 and a 95-horsepower electric motor for 416 combined horses and a 30-kilometer electric range. As opposed to the current production system, this e-Hybrid setup prioritizes all-electric motivation unless the driver instructs the car otherwise. The Sport Turismo is technically a plug-in hybrid since the lithium-ion battery pack can be fully charged in as little as 2.5 hours when plugged into a wall outlet. Porsche declares that the combined powertrain is proficient for 0\u2013 acceleration in less than six seconds, and that the Sport Turismo can exceed while running purely on electric power. In 2010, a variant for Taxis named \"Taxamera\" was created."
