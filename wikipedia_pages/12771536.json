He retired from active duty in 1946 at the rank of Colonel.\nSports historian.\nIn retirement, Col. Weyand wrote a series of acclaimed sports histories, including the seminal \"Saga of American Football\" (New York: MacMillan, 1955), foreword by &lt;a href=\"Grantland%20Rice\"&gt;Grantland Rice&lt;/a&gt; who described him as probably the then foremost living authority on the sport, winner of the 1955 Helms Athletic Foundation Award, and \"Football Immortals\" winner of the 1962 Helms Award. Sports historian John Sayle Watterson in his book \"College Football: History, Spectacle, Controversy\" (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000) described the \"Saga\" as follows \"[s]uccinct and fast-paced, Weyand's history masterfully depicts the game's origins, its early stars and teams, the geographic expansion of football, and the changes in its rules.\"\nIn 1965, Weyand and former &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20Fighting%20Blue%20Hens%20men%27s%20lacrosse\"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt; lacrosse coach Milton Roberts wrote \"The Lacrosse Story\", the first full-length history of &lt;a href=\"field%20lacrosse\"&gt;the sport of lacrosse&lt;/a&gt; based on nine years of research.\nDeath.\nWeyand died on May 10, 1982, in &lt;a href=\"North%20Bellmore%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;North Bellmore, New York&lt;/a&gt;. He is interred next to his wife, Marie, at &lt;a href=\"West%20Point%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;West Point, New York&lt;/a&gt;. His son, Lieutenant General Alexander Mulqueen Weyand (1928-2011), graduated from West Point in 1952 and was a member of the 1951 National Championship Lacrosse team."
