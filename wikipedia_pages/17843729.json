Graduating with a &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20College%20London\"&gt;Imperial College London&lt;/a&gt;, Hartley worked for the &lt;a href=\"North%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28UK%29\"&gt;North Eastern Railway&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"asphalt\"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt; manufacturer before joining the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Flying%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Flying Corps&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.

He was elected president of the &lt;a href=\"Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers\"&gt;Institution of Civil Engineers&lt;/a&gt; in 1959, but died three months into his tenure.\nEarly life.\nHartley was born at Springbank, &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20upon%20Hull\"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt; on 7 January 1889 to George Thomas Hartley, a surgeon, and his wife Elizabeth Briggs. He was educated at &lt;a href=\"Hymers%20College\"&gt;Hymers College&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hull%20Municipal%20Technical%20College\"&gt;Hull Municipal Technical College&lt;/a&gt; before attending the &lt;a href=\"City%20and%20Guilds%20College\"&gt;City and Guilds College&lt;/a&gt;, the engineering department of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20College%20London\"&gt;Imperial College London&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated with a &lt;a href=\"British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification\"&gt;third class honours&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt; in engineering in 1910.

He was responsible for the Air Board's development of &lt;a href=\"George%20Constantinescu\"&gt;George Constantinescu&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"synchronization%20gear\"&gt;interrupter gear&lt;/a&gt; which allowed a machine gun to be fired through the propeller blades of an aircraft without danger of damage. This invention was said by Air Vice Marshal Sir &lt;a href=\"John%20Maitland%20%28RAF%20officer%29\"&gt;John Maitland&lt;/a&gt; to be responsible for air superiority over German aircraft. He transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; on its establishment as a separate service.

This was a means of burning oil along runways to disperse fog. The system was installed at fifteen airfields across Britain, beginning in 1943. FIDO is credited with bringing 2,500 aircraft and 10,000 aircrew safely home during the war.\nHartley also developed the pipes used in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Pluto\"&gt;Operation Pluto&lt;/a&gt; (Pipe Lines Under The Ocean), a series of twenty-one undersea pipes used to transport oil from Britain to continental Europe to support the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Liberation of Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The system supplied the allied armies with of fuel per day during the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Allied%20invasion%20of%20Germany\"&gt;advance into Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and Hartley received \u00a39000 after the war for his work on Pluto from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Commission%20on%20Awards%20to%20Inventors\"&gt;Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors&lt;/a&gt;.

He retired from Anglo-Iranian (which would become &lt;a href=\"British%20Petroleum\"&gt;British Petroleum&lt;/a&gt; in 1954) in 1951 and became an engineering consultant during which time he developed the Hartley hoister \u2013 a device which allowed the loading of &lt;a href=\"oil%20tanker\"&gt;oil tanker&lt;/a&gt;s offshore. He was elected president of the &lt;a href=\"Institution%20of%20Mechanical%20Engineers\"&gt;Institution of Mechanical Engineers&lt;/a&gt; in 1951 and was an honorary fellow of the &lt;a href=\"City%20and%20Guilds%20of%20London%20Institute\"&gt;City and Guilds of London Institute&lt;/a&gt;. He was also made an honorary fellow of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20College%20London\"&gt;Imperial College London&lt;/a&gt; in 1953. In 1959 he received the Redwood Medal of the &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20Petroleum\"&gt;Institute of Petroleum&lt;/a&gt;. He was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1959. However he died just three months into his term at &lt;a href=\"St%20Thomas%27s%20Hospital\"&gt;St Thomas's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; on 28 January 1960.\nPersonal life.\nHartley married Dorothy Elizabeth Wallace, the daughter of a &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;-based marine engineer, in 1920 and had two sons.
