    "text": "Chris Lee is an &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; priest-in-charge at St. Saviour's Church in Wendell Park, &lt;a href=\"West%20London\"&gt;West London&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nLee described himself as being lost on a \"middle-class conveyor belt\" on what to do with his life. Lee later moved to &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; to teach English at a &lt;a href=\"Christian%20mission\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; using the Bible as his main teaching tool, where he states he found his calling to become a priest. He then completed a distance-learning degree to become a Church of England priest and was ordained a &lt;a href=\"deacon\"&gt;deacon&lt;/a&gt; in the diocese of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kilimanjaro\"&gt;Mount Kilimanjaro&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 24.\nHe moved to St Saviour's in 2015. He is married.\nOnline fame.\nLee first appeared on the YouTube channel &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Englishman\"&gt;Korean Englishman&lt;/a&gt;, where he ate &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Chicken%20Flavor%20Ramen\"&gt;fire noodles&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"chimaek\"&gt;chimaek&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Korean%20fried%20chicken\"&gt;Korean fried chicken&lt;/a&gt; and beer).\nHis response to the &lt;a href=\"College%20Scholastic%20Ability%20Test\"&gt;College Scholastic Ability Test&lt;/a&gt;, where he &lt;a href=\"prayed\"&gt;prayed&lt;/a&gt; for the students, made him &lt;a href=\"Internet%20celebrity\"&gt;famous online&lt;/a&gt;; he was seen as an open-minded and non-judgemental Christian voice on the channel. This led to the \"British Priest Reacts\" series on Korean Englishman's second channel, Jolly, on which he regularly featured. In 2019, he and his brother, a &lt;a href=\"commando\"&gt;commando&lt;/a&gt; in the British Army, went to &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; in the \"Twins\" series on Korean Englishman.\nFollowing his online popularity, he decided to posts images of his home life, as well as 60-second sermons and theological commentary on his Instagram. In 2020, he compiled some of these sermons into a book, \"The OMG Effect: 60-Second Sermons to Live a Fuller Life\".\nHe has called for the church to do more to reach younger people through &lt;a href=\"social%20media\"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;."
