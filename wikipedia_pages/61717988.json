    "title": "John Arkhaph",
    "text": "John Arkhaph (also spelled Arkaph or Archaph) was the bishop of &lt;a href=\"Memphis%2C%20Egypt\"&gt;Memphis&lt;/a&gt; in Egypt in the 320s and 330s. He was a disciple of Bishop &lt;a href=\"Melitios%20of%20Lykopolis\"&gt;Melitios of Lykopolis&lt;/a&gt;, whom he succeeded in 327 as leader of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Martyrs\"&gt;Church of the Martyrs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe origin and meaning of \"Arkhaph\" are uncertain. &lt;a href=\"Athanasius\"&gt;Athanasius&lt;/a&gt; treats it as a &lt;a href=\"Coptic%20language\"&gt;Coptic&lt;/a&gt; name and calls him \"Archaph who is also called John\". &lt;a href=\"Socrates%20Scholasticus\"&gt;Socrates Scholasticus&lt;/a&gt; transforms it into the Biblical name &lt;a href=\"Ahab\"&gt;Achab&lt;/a&gt;. Possibly it is formed from \"&lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3A%E1%BC%80%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B9-\"&gt;arch&lt;/a&gt;\" (supreme) and \"&lt;a href=\"Ab%20%28Semitic%29\"&gt;apa&lt;/a&gt;\" (father) as an alternate to the title &lt;a href=\"archiereus\"&gt;archiereus&lt;/a&gt; (high priest), which was used of the bishop of Alexandria in some Coptic documents. Besides Athanasius and Socrates, the historian &lt;a href=\"Sozomen\"&gt;Sozomen&lt;/a&gt; is an important source for John's career.\nJohn is first mentioned in the \"Breviarium Melitii\", a list of bishops and other clergy of the Church of the Martyrs submitted by Melitios to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea\"&gt;Council of Nicaea&lt;/a&gt; in 325. Nothing of his earlier life is known. Nor do any writings by him survive. He is \"a shadowy and controversial figure\".\nMelitios chose John as his successor shortly before his death in 327. The schism in the Egyptian church that had been healed at Nicaea was resumed in 328 at the election of Athanasius as &lt;a href=\"bishop%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;bishop of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;. John was a staunch opponent of Athanasius, although the two reconciled long enough for the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20I\"&gt;Constantine I&lt;/a&gt; to send John a letter of congratulations for ending the schism.\nThere is a note added beside John's name in Athanasius' copy of the \"Breviarium\": \"was ordered by the emperor to be with the bishop\". The exact meaning of the note and the identity of the bishop are a matter of academic debate. It may mean that John was ordered to submit to Athanasius in 328, or it may mean that John had been the representative of his church to the Alexandrian church at the time of the Council of Nicaea. Ultimately, the rivalry between John and Athanasius resulted in the latter's condemnation at the &lt;a href=\"First%20Synod%20of%20Tyre\"&gt;Council of Tyre&lt;/a&gt; in 335. Athanasius then went into exile, while John and his clergy were restored to their positions. Constantine, however, took exception to the council and exiled John and the rest of his clergy. In 337, the emperor died and Athanasius returned. Nothing more is known of John after the Tyrian settlement fell apart."
