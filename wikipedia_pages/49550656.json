    "text": "OmniSky was a &lt;a href=\"dotcom%20boom\"&gt;dotcom-era&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silicon%20Valley\"&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; startup, focused on web-enabled, wireless, mobile touchscreen products and services. Built around the &lt;a href=\"Palm%20V\"&gt;Palm V&lt;/a&gt;, OmniSky produced the first &lt;a href=\"touchscreen\"&gt;touchscreen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"handset\"&gt;handset&lt;/a&gt; to integrate &lt;a href=\"Google\"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;'s search engine. OmniSky was founded on May 7, 1999 and held an IPO through &lt;a href=\"NASDAQ\"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/a&gt; on September 21, 2000. It generated no revenue in 1999 and prior to its IPO it reported a lifetime total of $2.1 million revenue compared to a loss of more than $40 million. By November 2001 OmniSky reported that it was no longer able to complete its financial statements due to a possible pending bankruptcy. OmniSky sold to &lt;a href=\"EarthLink\"&gt;EarthLink&lt;/a&gt; in December 2001."
