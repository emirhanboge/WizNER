    "text": "Nihilist Communism: A Critique of Optimism \u2014 the Religious Dogma that states there will be an Ultimate Triumph of Good over Evil \u2014 in the Far Left is a collection of anti-authoritarian, anti-political, anti-organizational &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; perspectives cardinally developed by two anglophone authors using the pen names \"Fr\u00e8re\" and \"Le Gar\u00e7on\". Since at least 2001, according to the dates of various letters and writings in the book, they have written collaboratively as Monsieur Dupont.\n\"Nihilist Communism\" aims to level \"a critique of optimism in the far left\". Rather than attempting to establish new and popular sets of positions, it is counterpoised against, among many other things, the \"religious\" dogma of the Marxist and anarchist milieus. It attempts to disencumber itself of its content in order to explore new concepts and ideas. "
