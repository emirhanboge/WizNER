    "text": "Deep Insight is a rock band from &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. The band was formed in early 2002 by childhood friends Jukka (&lt;a href=\"vocals\"&gt;vocals&lt;/a&gt;) and Johannes (&lt;a href=\"guitar\"&gt;guitar&lt;/a&gt;). They were later joined by Miska (&lt;a href=\"Bass%20%28guitar%29\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt;) and Ville (&lt;a href=\"drums\"&gt;drums&lt;/a&gt;).\nTheir music is a mixture of American and emo rock, with &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;n influences. As of 2008 they had played more than 400 shows in 20 countries. The single \"Hurricane Season\" reached number one on the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;Finnish Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, retaining its position for six weeks.\nHistory.\nThe band's first release, an EP titled Julia, was a concept album whose lyrics focused on the life and death of Julia, a character created by Jukka and Johannes. It gained many good reviews, most of them praising the young band's promising songwriting and Jukka's exceptional voice.\nIn 2003 the band recorded their debut &lt;a href=\"album\"&gt;album&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Tower\"&gt;Ivory Tower&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Soundtrack%20Studios\"&gt;Soundtrack Studios&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;. Kaj was replaced by Miska on bass. The album was released in May and the band started their first &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;a href=\"concert%20tour\"&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir second album \"Red Lights, White Lines\" was recorded and mixed between June and July 2004 in &lt;a href=\"Fascination%20Street%20Studio\"&gt;Fascination Street Studio&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"%C3%96rebro\"&gt;\u00d6rebro&lt;/a&gt;, under producers &lt;a href=\"Jens%20Borgen\"&gt;Jens Borgen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20Olsson%20%28record%20producer%29\"&gt;Jonas Olsson&lt;/a&gt;. The album was mastered at cutting room in &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Eberger\"&gt;Thomas Eberger&lt;/a&gt;. \"Red Lights, White Lines\" was released in Finland and &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 and later in &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. By the summer of 2005 the album was sold out and re-released in the same fall with new cover art work.\nTheir third album \"One Minute Too Late\" was released in Finland on 18 October 2006. Miska left the band and was replaced by Jore. The album's debut single \"New Day\" was released on 20 September 2006 and on its second week reached number 1 on Finland's &lt;a href=\"YLE\"&gt;YleX&lt;/a&gt; most wanted chart.\nDiscography.\nAlbums.\n1.
