Following Sobral's triumph, the &lt;a href=\"European%20Broadcasting%20Union\"&gt;European Broadcasting Union&lt;/a&gt; (EBU)'s Executive Supervisor for the Eurovision Song Contest, &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Ola%20Sand\"&gt;Jon Ola Sand&lt;/a&gt;, issued the hosting invitation to RTP during the winner's press conference. The following day, the director-general of RTP, Nuno Artur Silva, confirmed that the broadcaster would organise the contest in 2018 and mentioned MEO Arena (later renamed &lt;a href=\"Altice%20Arena\"&gt;Altice Arena&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; as a likely venue to host the contest. On 15 May 2017, RTP appeared to have confirmed Lisbon as the host city, but clarified the following day that no final decision had been taken regarding both the host city and venue.\nThe basic requirements to select a host city were set out in a document presented by the EBU to RTP following their win in Kyiv:\nBesides Lisbon, other cities signalled their interest in bidding to host the 2018 contest: &lt;a href=\"Braga\"&gt;Braga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Espinho%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Espinho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faro%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Faro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gondomar%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Gondomar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guimar%C3%A3es\"&gt;Guimar\u00e3es&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20da%20Feira\"&gt;Santa Maria da Feira&lt;/a&gt;.

They also had the opportunity to present their first plans for the 2018 contest, including multiple proposals for the host city and venue.\nOn 25 July 2017, the EBU and RTP announced that Lisbon had been selected as the host city, overcoming confirmed bids from Braga, Gondomar, Guimar\u00e3es, and Santa Maria da Feira.

It was located in Lisbon's downtown &lt;a href=\"Pra%C3%A7a%20do%20Com%C3%A9rcio\"&gt;Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio&lt;/a&gt; (also called \"Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o\"), a large central square open to the &lt;a href=\"Tagus%20river\"&gt;Tagus river&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe EuroClub was the venue for the official after-parties and private performances by contest participants. Unlike the Eurovision Village, access to the EuroClub was restricted to accredited fans, delegations, and press. It was located at the \"Ministerium\" club, next to the Eurovision Village.\nThe \"Blue Carpet\" event, where all the contestants and their delegations are presented before the accredited press and fans, took place on 6 May 2018 at the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Art%2C%20Architecture%20and%20Technology\"&gt;Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology&lt;/a&gt; (MAAT) in Lisbon's &lt;a href=\"Bel%C3%A9m%20%28Lisbon%29\"&gt;Bel\u00e9m&lt;/a&gt; district.

Its visual design features oceanic motifs that allude to Lisbon and Portugal's location on the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; coast and to the country's seafaring history. Alongside the main emblem, which depicts a stylised &lt;a href=\"seashell\"&gt;seashell&lt;/a&gt;, twelve supplemental emblems were designed to symbolise different aspects of the marine ecosystem.\nPostcards.\nThe postcards, filmed between March and April 2018, involved the act emerging from a door into Portugal to take part in a themed activity, such as &lt;a href=\"mountain%20biking\"&gt;mountain biking&lt;/a&gt;, making a salad or \"&lt;a href=\"pastel%20de%20nata\"&gt;pastel de nata&lt;/a&gt;\", or visiting popular attractions. The location where the activity took place was written in Portuguese at the start of the postcard. At the end of the postcard, the act posed for the camera, the slogan's hashtag appeared on the bottom corner of the screen, and song information was printed onto the country's flag. All the postcards had the same score, composed by Luis Figueredo.\nPresenters.\nRTP and EBU announced on 8 January 2018, that the contest would be hosted for the first time by four female presenters, consisting of RTP hosts &lt;a href=\"S%C3%ADlvia%20Alberto\"&gt;S\u00edlvia Alberto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Filomena%20Cautela\"&gt;Filomena Cautela&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Catarina%20Furtado\"&gt;Catarina Furtado&lt;/a&gt;, together with actress &lt;a href=\"Daniela%20Ruah\"&gt;Daniela Ruah&lt;/a&gt;.

It was confirmed on 4 May 2018 that Cautela would host the &lt;a href=\"green%20room\"&gt;green room&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Blue Carpet opening ceremony was hosted by actress &lt;a href=\"w%3Apt%3ACl%C3%A1udia%20Semedo\"&gt;Cl\u00e1udia Semedo&lt;/a&gt;, radio host In\u00eas Lopes Gon\u00e7alves, actor/TV host &lt;a href=\"w%3Apt%3APedro%20Granger\"&gt;Pedro Granger&lt;/a&gt;, and actor/director &lt;a href=\"w%3Apt%3APedro%20Penim\"&gt;Pedro Penim&lt;/a&gt;. Granger and Penim moderated the press conferences, as well.\nSemi-final allocation draw.\nThe draw to determine the allocation of the participating countries into their respective semi-finals took place on 29 January 2018 at 13:00 &lt;a href=\"Central%20European%20Time\"&gt;CET&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Lisbon%20City%20Hall\"&gt;Lisbon's City Hall&lt;/a&gt;. The thirty-seven semi-finalists were divided over six pots, based on historical voting patterns as calculated by the contest's official televoting partner Digame. The purpose of drawing from different pots was to reduce the chance of \"bloc voting\" and to increase suspense in the semi-finals. The draw also determined which semi-final each of the six automatic qualifiers \u2013 host country Portugal and \"&lt;a href=\"Big%20Five%20%28Eurovision%29\"&gt;Big Five&lt;/a&gt;\" countries , , , and the \u2013 would broadcast and vote in.

It's a costume\".\nBelarusian song submission.\nOn 10 January 2018, it had emerged on Russian social media site &lt;a href=\"VK%20%28social%20networking%20website%29\"&gt;VK&lt;/a&gt; that Ukrainian singer &lt;a href=\"Alekseev%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Alekseev&lt;/a&gt; had performed a &lt;a href=\"Russian%20language\"&gt;Russian-language&lt;/a&gt; version of his &lt;a href=\"Belarus%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202018\"&gt;\"EuroFest\"&lt;/a&gt; entry \"&lt;a href=\"Forever%20%28Alekseev%20song%29\"&gt;Forever&lt;/a&gt;\" (as \"Navsegda\") in May 2017 in &lt;a href=\"Stavropol\"&gt;Stavropol&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 before 1 September 2017, the submission deadline set by the EBU, potentially violating the rules of the contest. Six artists threatened to withdraw from the selection if it were allowed to compete, with Sofi Lapina actually doing so. Alekseev was ultimately allowed to compete by &lt;a href=\"National%20State%20Television%20and%20Radio%20Company%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus\"&gt;BTRC&lt;/a&gt; following a melodic revamp of the song, and went on to win the selection, thus earning the right to represent Belarus in the contest. However, on 23 February 2018, it was reported that the EBU had given Alekseev permission to perform his original English-language version of the song at the contest, and he would opt to sing that version of the song in May. A few weeks after that announcement, on 28 March 2018, Alekseev premiered a new version of his entry with a lighter intro and additional choir at the end of the track.

The singer updated his fans on Instagram, stating \"I can confirm that I got injured during the rehearsal and the situation got worse after several hours. I can't even walk now. Got back from the first hospital and I am now heading to another one\". He stated that he would, however, \"perform no matter what\". Josef performed in the first semi-final on 8 May with a slightly altered performance, owing to his injuries, and ultimately finished sixth in the final, achieving the Czech Republic's best result to date. He was also the second Czech contestant to qualify for the final, the other being &lt;a href=\"Gabriela%20Gun%C4%8D%C3%ADkov%C3%A1\"&gt;Gabriela Gun\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; in .\nChina\u2019s Mango TV censorship.\nDuring the Chinese broadcast of the first semi-final on &lt;a href=\"Mango%20TV\"&gt;Mango TV&lt;/a&gt;, the performances of &lt;a href=\"Albania%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202018\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202018\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; were edited out of the show, along with their snippets in the recap of all 19 entries. Albania was skipped due to a ban on television performers displaying tattoos that took effect in January 2018, while Ireland was &lt;a href=\"LGBT%20rights%20in%20China\"&gt;censored&lt;/a&gt; due to its representation of a homosexual couple on-stage. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Rainbow%20flag%20%28LGBT%20movement%29\"&gt;LGBT flag&lt;/a&gt; and tattoos on other performers were also blurred out from the broadcast. As a result, the EBU has terminated its partnership with Mango TV, citing that censorship \"is not in line with the EBU's values of universality and inclusivity and its proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music,\" which led to a ban on televising the second semi-final and the grand final in the country. A spokesperson for the broadcaster's owner &lt;a href=\"Hunan%20Broadcasting%20System\"&gt;Hunan TV&lt;/a&gt; said they \"weren't aware\" of the edits made to the programme. Ireland's representative, Ryan O'Shaughnessy told the BBC in an interview, \"they haven't taken this lightly and I think it's a move in the right direction, so I'm happy about it.\"\nUnited Kingdom stage invasion.\nThe performance of &lt;a href=\"SuRie\"&gt;SuRie&lt;/a&gt;, representing the United Kingdom, in the final was disrupted by a man who rushed onto the stage and grabbed her &lt;a href=\"microphone\"&gt;microphone&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly shouting \"For the Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom! War is not peace.\" The man, later identified as 'Dr ACactivism', a political activist from London, climbed into a camera run to get access to the stage. SuRie was able to complete her performance, and after the song the broadcast cut to an unscheduled interview in the green room. The EBU offered SuRie and her team the opportunity to perform again, but she declined. SuRie later revealed that she had suffered several bruises on her right hand. Shortly after the live broadcast on YouTube, the final was taken down and reuploaded in its entirety, with SuRie's interrupted performance edited out and substituted with her jury show performance from the previous evening. The official reupload also retains the unscheduled green room interview with the Ukrainian delegation that followed the stage invasion. The official DVD release also replaces the interrupted grand final performance with the previous evening's jury show performance. However, the British national broadcaster &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; uploaded the original Saturday performance, including the stage invasion, to their YouTube channel.\nOther awards.\nIn addition to the main winner's trophy, the &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Bezen%C3%A7on%20Awards\"&gt;Marcel Bezen\u00e7on Awards&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Dex%20Award\"&gt;Barbara Dex Award&lt;/a&gt; were contested during the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest. The &lt;a href=\"OGAE\"&gt;OGAE&lt;/a&gt;, \"General Organisation of Eurovision Fans\" voting poll also took place before the contest.\nMarcel Bezen\u00e7on Awards.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Bezen%C3%A7on%20Awards\"&gt;Marcel Bezen\u00e7on Awards&lt;/a&gt;, organised since 2002 by Sweden's then-Head of Delegation and 1992 representative &lt;a href=\"Christer%20Bj%C3%B6rkman\"&gt;Christer Bj\u00f6rkman&lt;/a&gt;, and 1984 winner &lt;a href=\"Herreys\"&gt;Richard Herrey&lt;/a&gt;, honours songs in the contest's final. The awards are divided into three categories: Artistic Award, Composers Award, and Press Award. The winners were revealed shortly before the Eurovision final on 12 May.\nOGAE.\n&lt;a href=\"OGAE\"&gt;OGAE&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation of over forty Eurovision Song Contest fan clubs across Europe and beyond, conducts an annual voting poll first held in 2002 as the Marcel Bezen\u00e7on Fan Award. After all votes were cast, the top-ranked entry in the 2018 poll was also the winner of the contest, \"&lt;a href=\"Toy%20%28song%29\"&gt;Toy&lt;/a&gt;\" performed by &lt;a href=\"Netta%20Barzilai\"&gt;Netta&lt;/a&gt;; the top five results are shown below.\nBarbara Dex Award.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Dex%20Award\"&gt;Barbara Dex Award&lt;/a&gt; is a humorous fan award given to the worst dressed artist each year.
