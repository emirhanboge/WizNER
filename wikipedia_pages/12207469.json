    "text": "Sophia Eleonore of Saxony (23 November 1609 \u2013 2 June 1671) was a duchess of &lt;a href=\"Electorate%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt; by birth and the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Hessian%20consorts%23Landgravines%20of%20Hesse-Darmstadt%20%281567%E2%80%931806%29\"&gt;landgravine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Landgraviate%20of%20Hesse-Darmstadt\"&gt;Hesse-Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt; from 1627 to 1661 through her marriage to &lt;a href=\"Landgrave\"&gt;Landgrave&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20II%2C%20Landgrave%20of%20Hesse-Darmstadt\"&gt;George II&lt;/a&gt;. She was the eldest surviving child of &lt;a href=\"John%20George%20I%2C%20Elector%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;John George I, Elector of Saxony&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Duchess%20Magdalene%20Sibylle%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia&lt;/a&gt;. \nLife.\nShe was born in &lt;a href=\"Dresden\"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt;. Her two sisters were &lt;a href=\"Duchess%20Marie%20Elisabeth%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Marie Elisabeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magdalene%20Sibylle%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Magdalene Sibylle&lt;/a&gt;. Her brothers were &lt;a href=\"John%20George%20II%2C%20Elector%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Johann Georg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Augustus%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weissenfels\"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christian%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Merseburg\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maurice%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Zeitz\"&gt;Maurice&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe married Landgrave &lt;a href=\"George%20II%2C%20Landgrave%20of%20Hesse-Darmstadt\"&gt;Georg II of Hesse-Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April 1627 in &lt;a href=\"Torgau\"&gt;Torgau&lt;/a&gt;, aged seventeen. In the middle of &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt; their marriage was lavishly celebrated with the first opera in German language. They had fifteen children; she raised them as strict &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt;s. However, her daughter Elisabeth Amalie, later Electress Palatine, converted to &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism\"&gt;Roman Catholicism&lt;/a&gt; in 1653.\nSophie Eleonore showed huge interest in antiquarian books which she collected. Her contribution to the Hesse-Darmstadt court library is still visible today. She survived her husband by ten years and died in &lt;a href=\"Darmstadt\"&gt;Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt;.\nChildren.\nShe had the following children with &lt;a href=\"George%20II%2C%20Landgrave%20of%20Hesse-Darmstadt\"&gt;George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt;:"
