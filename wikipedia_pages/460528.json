In Sanskrit, the title translates as \"The Heart of the &lt;a href=\"Prajnaparamita\"&gt;Perfection of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Sutra famously states, \"Form is emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), emptiness is form.\" It is a condensed expos\u00e9 on the Buddhist Mahayana teaching of the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Truths%20doctrine\"&gt;Two Truths doctrine&lt;/a&gt;, which says that ultimately all phenomena are &lt;a href=\"sunyata\"&gt;sunyata&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has been called \"the most frequently used and recited text in the entire Mahayana Buddhist tradition.\" The text has been translated into English dozens of times from Chinese, Sanskrit and Tibetan as well as other source languages.\nSummary of the sutra.\nIn the sutra, &lt;a href=\"Avalokite%C5%9Bvara\"&gt;Avalokite\u015bvara&lt;/a&gt; addresses &lt;a href=\"Sariputta\"&gt;\u015aariputra&lt;/a&gt;, explaining the fundamental emptiness (&lt;a href=\"%C5%9B%C5%ABnyat%C4%81\"&gt;\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101&lt;/a&gt;) of all phenomena, known through and as the five aggregates of human existence (&lt;a href=\"skandha\"&gt;skandha&lt;/a&gt;s): form (&lt;a href=\"r%C5%ABpa\"&gt;r\u016bpa&lt;/a&gt;), feeling (&lt;a href=\"vedan%C4%81\"&gt;vedan\u0101&lt;/a&gt;), volitions (&lt;a href=\"sa%E1%B9%85kh%C4%81ra\"&gt;sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra&lt;/a&gt;), perceptions (&lt;a href=\"sa%E1%B9%83j%C3%B1%C4%81\"&gt;sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101&lt;/a&gt;), and consciousness (&lt;a href=\"vij%C3%B1%C4%81na\"&gt;vij\u00f1\u0101na&lt;/a&gt;). Avalokite\u015bvara famously states, \"Form is Emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101). Emptiness is Form\", and declares the other skandhas to be equally empty\u2014that is, &lt;a href=\"Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da\"&gt;dependently originated&lt;/a&gt;.\nAvalokite\u015bvara then goes through some of the most fundamental Buddhist teachings such as the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Noble%20Truths\"&gt;Four Noble Truths&lt;/a&gt;, and explains that in emptiness none of these notions apply. This is interpreted according to the &lt;a href=\"two%20truths%20doctrine\"&gt;two truths doctrine&lt;/a&gt; as saying that teachings, while accurate descriptions of conventional truth, are mere statements about reality\u2014they are not reality itself\u2014and that they are therefore not applicable to the ultimate truth that is by definition beyond mental understanding. Thus the bodhisattva, as the archetypal Mahayana Buddhist, relies on the perfection of wisdom, defined in the \"&lt;a href=\"Mahaprajnaparamita%20Sutra\"&gt;Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra&lt;/a&gt;\" to be the wisdom that perceives reality directly without conceptual &lt;a href=\"up%C4%81d%C4%81na\"&gt;attachment&lt;/a&gt;, thereby achieving nirvana.\nThe sutra concludes with the mantra \"\", meaning \"gone, gone, everyone gone to the other shore, awakening, &lt;a href=\"svaha\"&gt;svaha&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nPopularity and stature.\nThe Heart Sutra is \"the single most commonly recited, copied and studied scripture in East Asian Buddhism.\" It is recited by adherents of Mahayana schools of Buddhism regardless of sectarian affiliation.\nWhile the origin of the sutra is disputed by some modern scholars, it was widely known throughout &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt; (including Afghanistan) from at least the &lt;a href=\"Pala%20Empire\"&gt;Pala Empire&lt;/a&gt; period (c. 750\u20131200 CE) and in parts of India until at least the middle of the 14th century. The stature of the Heart Sutra throughout early medieval India can be seen from its title 'Holy Mother of all Buddhas Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom' dating from at least the 8th century CE (see Philological explanation of the text).\nThe long version of the Heart Sutra is extensively studied by the various &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20Buddhism\"&gt;Tibetan Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; schools, where the Heart Sutra is chanted, but also treated as a tantric text, with a tantric ceremony associated with it. It is also viewed as one of the daughter sutras of the Prajnaparamita genre in the Vajrayana tradition as passed down from Tibet.\nThe text has been translated into many languages, and dozens of English translations and commentaries have been published, along with an unknown number of informal versions on the internet.\nVersions.\nThere are two main versions of the Heart Sutra: a short version and a long version.\nThe short version as translated by &lt;a href=\"Xuanzang\"&gt;Xuanzang&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular version of adherents practicing East Asian schools of Buddhism. Xuanzang's canonical text (T. 251) has a total of 260 Chinese characters. Some Japanese and Korean versions have an additional 2 characters. The short version has also been translated into Tibetan but it is not part of the current &lt;a href=\"Kangyur\"&gt;Tibetan Buddhist Canon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe long version differs from the short version by including both an introductory and concluding section, features that most Buddhist sutras have. The introduction introduces the sutra to the listener with the traditional Buddhist opening phrase \"Thus have I heard\". It then describes the venue in which the Buddha (or sometimes bodhisattvas, etc.) promulgate the teaching and the audience to whom the teaching is given. The concluding section ends the sutra with thanks and praises to the Buddha.\nBoth versions are chanted on a daily basis by adherents of practically all schools of East Asian Buddhism and by some adherents of Tibetan and &lt;a href=\"Newar%20Buddhism\"&gt;Newar Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;.\nDating and origins.\nEarliest extant versions and references to the Heart Sutra.\nThe earliest extant dated text of the \"Heart Sutra\" is a stone stele dated to 661 CE located at Yunju Temple and is part of the &lt;a href=\"Fangshan%20Stone%20Sutra\"&gt;Fangshan Stone Sutra&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the earliest copy of Xuanzang's 649 CE translation of the Heart Sutra (Taisho 221); made three years before Xuanzang passed away.\nA palm-leaf manuscript found at the &lt;a href=\"H%C5%8Dry%C5%AB-ji\"&gt;H\u014dry\u016b-ji&lt;/a&gt; Temple is the earliest undated extant Sanskrit manuscript of the Heart Sutra. It is dated to c. 7th\u20138th century CE by the Tokyo National Museum where it is currently kept.\nSource of the Heart Sutra - Nattier controversy.\n&lt;a href=\"Jan%20Nattier\"&gt;Jan Nattier&lt;/a&gt; (1992) argues, based on her cross-philological study of Chinese and Sanskrit texts of the Heart Sutra, that the Heart Sutra was initially composed in China. \n&lt;a href=\"Fukui%20Fumimasa\"&gt;Fukui Fumimasa&lt;/a&gt;, Harada Waso, Ishii K\u014dsei and Siu Sai yau based on their cross-philological study of Chinese and Sanskrit texts of the Heart Sutra and other medieval period Sanskrit Mahayana sutras theorize that the Heart Sutra could not have been composed in China but was composed in India.\n&lt;a href=\"Kuiji\"&gt;Kuiji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Woncheuk\"&gt;Woncheuk&lt;/a&gt; were the two main disciples of Xuanzang. Their 7th century commentaries are the earliest extant commentaries on the Heart Sutra; both commentaries, according to Hyun Choo, Harada Waso, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25E7%259F%25B3%25E4%25BA%2595%25E5%2585%25AC%25E6%2588%2590\"&gt;Ishii Kosei&lt;/a&gt;, Dan Lusthaus, etc., contradict Nattier's Chinese origin theory. \nPhilological explanation of the text.\nTitle.\nHistorical titles.\nThe titles of the earliest extant manuscripts of the Heart Sutra all includes the words \"h\u1e5bdaya\" or \"heart\" and \"praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\" or \"perfection of wisdom\". Beginning from the 8th century and continuing at least until the 13th century, the titles of the Indic manuscripts of the Heart Sutra contained the words \"bhagavat\u012b\" or \"mother of all buddhas\" and \"praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\".\nLater Indic manuscripts have more varied titles.\nTitles in use today.\nIn the western world, this sutra is known as the Heart Sutra (a translation derived from its most common name in East Asian countries). But it is also sometimes called the Heart of Wisdom Sutra. In Tibet, Mongolia and other regions influenced by Vajrayana, it is known as The [Holy] Mother of all Buddhas Heart (Essence) of the Perfection of Wisdom.\nIn the Tibetan text the title is given first in Sanskrit and then in Tibetan: (\"\"), English translation of Tibetan title: Mother of All Buddhas Heart (Essence) of the Perfection of Wisdom.\nIn other languages, the commonly used title is an abbreviation of Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101h\u1e5bdayas\u016btra\u1e43 : i.e. The Praj\u00f1\u0101h\u1e5bdaya S\u016btra )(The Heart of Wisdom Sutra). They are as follows: e.g. Korean: \"Banya Shimgyeong\" (); Japanese: ; Vietnamese: (&lt;a href=\"ch%E1%BB%AF%20Nho\"&gt;ch\u1eef Nho&lt;/a&gt;: ).\nContent.\nVarious commentators divide this text into different numbers of sections. In the long version, there exists the traditional opening \"&lt;a href=\"Thus%20have%20I%20heard\"&gt;Thus have I heard&lt;/a&gt;\" and Buddha along with a community of bodhisattvas and monks gathered with Avalokite\u015bvara and Sariputra at Gridhakuta (a mountain peak located at &lt;a href=\"Rajgir\"&gt;Rajgir&lt;/a&gt;, the traditional site where the majority of the Perfection of Wisdom teachings were given) , when through the power of Buddha, Sariputra asks Avalokite\u015bvara for advice on the practice of the Perfection of Wisdom. The sutra then describes the experience of liberation of the \"&lt;a href=\"bodhisattva\"&gt;bodhisattva&lt;/a&gt;\" of compassion, &lt;a href=\"Avalokite%C5%9Bvara\"&gt;Avalokite\u015bvara&lt;/a&gt;, as a result of &lt;a href=\"vipassan%C4%81\"&gt;vipassan\u0101&lt;/a&gt; gained while engaged in deep meditation to awaken the faculty of &lt;a href=\"Praj%C3%B1%C4%81%20%28Buddhism%29\"&gt;praj\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; (wisdom). The insight refers to apprehension of the fundamental emptiness (&lt;a href=\"%C5%9B%C5%ABnyat%C4%81\"&gt;\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101&lt;/a&gt;) of all phenomena, known through and as the five aggregates of human existence (&lt;a href=\"skandha\"&gt;skandha&lt;/a&gt;s): form (&lt;a href=\"r%C5%ABpa\"&gt;r\u016bpa&lt;/a&gt;), feeling (&lt;a href=\"vedan%C4%81\"&gt;vedan\u0101&lt;/a&gt;), volitions (&lt;a href=\"sa%E1%B9%85kh%C4%81ra\"&gt;sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra&lt;/a&gt;), perceptions (&lt;a href=\"sa%E1%B9%83j%C3%B1%C4%81\"&gt;sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101&lt;/a&gt;), and consciousness (&lt;a href=\"vij%C3%B1%C4%81na\"&gt;vij\u00f1\u0101na&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe specific sequence of concepts listed in lines 12\u201320 (\"...in emptiness there is no form, no sensation, ... no attainment and no non-attainment\") is the same sequence used in the Sarvastivadin \"Samyukta Agama\"; this sequence differs in comparable texts of other sects. On this basis, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Pine%20%28author%29\"&gt;Red Pine&lt;/a&gt; has argued that the \"Heart S\u016btra\" is specifically a response to Sarvastivada teachings that, in the sense \"phenomena\" or its constituents, are real. Lines 12\u201313 enumerate the five skandhas. Lines 14\u201315 list the twelve &lt;a href=\"ayatana\"&gt;ayatana&lt;/a&gt;s or abodes. Line 16 makes a reference to the 18 \"dhatus\" or elements of consciousness, using a conventional shorthand of naming only the first (eye) and last (conceptual consciousness) of the elements. Lines 17\u201318 assert the emptiness of the &lt;a href=\"Twelve%20Nid%C4%81nas\"&gt;Twelve Nid\u0101nas&lt;/a&gt;, the traditional twelve links of dependent origination, using the same shorthand as with the eighteen dhatus. Line 19 refers to the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Noble%20Truths\"&gt;Four Noble Truths&lt;/a&gt;.\nAvalokite\u015bvara addresses &lt;a href=\"Sariputta\"&gt;\u015aariputra&lt;/a&gt;, who was the promulgator of &lt;a href=\"abhidharma\"&gt;abhidharma&lt;/a&gt; according to the scriptures and texts of the &lt;a href=\"Sarvastivada\"&gt;Sarvastivada&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"early%20Buddhist%20schools\"&gt;early Buddhist schools&lt;/a&gt;, having been singled out by the Buddha to receive those teachings. Avalokite\u015bvara famously states, \"Form is empty (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101). Emptiness is form\", and declares the other skandhas to be equally empty of the most fundamental Buddhist teachings such as the Four Noble Truths and explains that in emptiness none of these notions apply. This is interpreted according to the &lt;a href=\"two%20truths%20doctrine\"&gt;two truths doctrine&lt;/a&gt; as saying that teachings, while accurate descriptions of conventional truth, are mere statements about reality\u2014they are not reality itself\u2014and that they are therefore not applicable to the ultimate truth that is by definition beyond mental understanding. Thus the bodhisattva, as the archetypal Mahayana Buddhist, relies on the perfection of wisdom, defined in the \"Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra\" to be the wisdom that perceives reality directly without conceptual &lt;a href=\"up%C4%81d%C4%81na\"&gt;attachment&lt;/a&gt; thereby achieving nirvana.\nAll Buddhas of the three ages (past, present and future) rely on the Perfection of Wisdom to reach unexcelled complete Enlightenment. The Perfection of Wisdom is the all powerful Mantra, the great enlightening mantra, the unexcelled mantra, the unequalled mantra, able to dispel all suffering. This is true and not false. The Perfection of Wisdom is then condensed in the mantra with which the sutra concludes: \"Gate Gate P\u0101ragate P\u0101rasamgate Bodhi Sv\u0101h\u0101\" (literally \"Gone gone, gone beyond, gone utterly beyond, Enlightenment hail!\"). In the long version, Buddha praises Avalokite\u015bvara for giving the exposition of the Perfection of Wisdom and all gathered rejoice in its teaching. Many schools traditionally have also praised the sutra by uttering three times the equivalent of \"Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\" after the end of the recitation of the short version.\nMantra.\nThe \"Heart S\u016btra\" mantra in Sanskrit &lt;a href=\"International%20Alphabet%20of%20Sanskrit%20Transliteration\"&gt;IAST&lt;/a&gt; is \"\", &lt;a href=\"Devanagari\"&gt;Devanagari&lt;/a&gt;: \u0917\u0924\u0947 \u0917\u0924\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u0917\u0924\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u0938\u0902\u0917\u0924\u0947 \u092c\u094b\u0927\u093f \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0939\u093e, &lt;a href=\"International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet\"&gt;IPA&lt;/a&gt;: , meaning \"gone, gone, everyone gone to the other shore, awakening, &lt;a href=\"svaha\"&gt;svaha&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBuddhist exegetical works.\nChina, Japan, Korea and Vietnam.\nTwo commentaries of the Heart Sutra were composed by pupils of Xuanzang, Woncheuk and Kuiji, in the 7th century. These appear to be the earliest extant commentaries on the text. Both have been translated into English. Both Ku\u012bj\u012b and Woncheuk's commentaries approach the Heart Sutra from both a &lt;a href=\"Yog%C4%81c%C4%81ra\"&gt;Yog\u0101c\u0101ra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Madhyamaka\"&gt;Madhyamaka&lt;/a&gt; viewpoint; however, Ku\u012bj\u012b's commentary presents detailed line by line &lt;a href=\"Madhyamaka\"&gt;Madhyamaka&lt;/a&gt; viewpoints as well and is therefore the earliest surviving Madhyamaka commentary on the Heart Sutra. Of special note, although Woncheuk did his work in China, he was born in &lt;a href=\"Silla\"&gt;Silla&lt;/a&gt;, one of the kingdoms located at the time in Korea.\nThe chief Tang Dynasty commentaries have all now been translated into English.\nNotable Japanese commentaries include those by &lt;a href=\"K%C5%ABkai\"&gt;K\u016bkai&lt;/a&gt; (9th Century, Japan), who treats the text as a tantra, and &lt;a href=\"Hakuin\"&gt;Hakuin&lt;/a&gt;, who gives a Zen commentary.\nThere is also a Vietnamese commentarial tradition for the Heart Sutra. The earliest recorded commentary is the early 14th century &lt;a href=\"Thi%E1%BB%81n\"&gt;Thi\u1ec1n&lt;/a&gt; commentary entitled 'Commentary on the Praj\u00f1\u0101h\u1e5bdaya Sutra' by &lt;a href=\"Phap%20Loa\"&gt;Ph\u00e1p Loa&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll of the East Asian commentaries are commentaries of Xuanzang's translation of the short version of the Heart Sutra. Kukai's commentary is purportedly of &lt;a href=\"Kum%C4%81raj%C4%ABva\"&gt;Kum\u0101raj\u012bva&lt;/a&gt;'s translation of the short version of the Heart Sutra;but upon closer examination seems to quote only from Xuanzang's translation.\nIndia.\nEight Indian commentaries survive in Tibetan translation and have been the subject of two books by Donald Lopez. These typically treat the text either from a Madhyamaka point of view, or as a tantra (esp. \u015ar\u012bsi\u1e43ha). \u015ar\u012b Mah\u0101jana's commentary has a definite \"Yogachara bent\". All of these commentaries are on the long version of the Heart Sutra. The Eight Indian Commentaries from the Kangyur are (cf first eight on chart):\nThere is one surviving Chinese translation of an Indian commentary in the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Buddhist%20Canon\"&gt;Chinese Buddhist Canon&lt;/a&gt;. \u0100ryadeva's commentary is on the short version of the Heart Sutra.\nOther.\nBesides the Tibetan translation of Indian commentaries on the Heart Sutra, Tibetan monk-scholars also made their own commentaries. One example is &lt;a href=\"T%C4%81ran%C4%81tha\"&gt;T\u0101ran\u0101tha&lt;/a&gt;'s A Textual Commentary on the Heart Sutra.\nIn modern times, the text has become increasingly popular amongst exegetes as a growing number of translations and commentaries attest. The Heart Sutra was already popular in Chan and Zen Buddhism, but has become a staple for Tibetan Lamas as well.\nSelected English translations.\nThe first English translation was presented to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Asiatic%20Society\"&gt;Royal Asiatic Society&lt;/a&gt; in 1863 by &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Beal\"&gt;Samuel Beal&lt;/a&gt;, and published in their journal in 1865. Beal used a Chinese text corresponding to T251 and a 9th Century &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Buddhism\"&gt;Chan&lt;/a&gt; commentary by D\u00e0di\u0101n B\u01ceot\u014dng () [c. 815 CE]. In 1881, Max M\u00fcller published a Sanskrit text based on the H\u014dry\u016b-ji manuscript along an English translation.\nThere are more than 40 published English translations of the Heart Sutra from Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan, beginning with Beal (1865). Almost every year new translations and commentaries are published. The following is a representative sample.\nRecordings.\nThe \"Heart S\u016btra\" has been set to music a number of times. Many singers solo this sutra.\nPopular culture.\nIn the centuries following the historical &lt;a href=\"Xuanzang\"&gt;Xuanzang&lt;/a&gt;, an extended tradition of literature fictionalizing the life of Xuanzang and glorifying his special relationship with the \"Heart S\u016btra\" arose, of particular note being the \"&lt;a href=\"Journey%20to%20the%20West\"&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/a&gt;\" (16th century/Ming dynasty). In chapter nineteen of \"Journey to the West\", the fictitious Xuanzang learns by heart the \"Heart S\u016btra\" after hearing it recited one time by the Crow's Nest Zen Master, who flies down from his tree perch with a scroll containing it, and offers to impart it. A full text of the \"Heart S\u016btra\" is quoted in this fictional account.\nIn the 2003 Korean film &lt;a href=\"Spring%2C%20Summer%2C%20Fall%2C%20Winter...%20and%20Spring\"&gt;\"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring\"&lt;/a&gt;, the apprentice is ordered by his Master to carve the Chinese characters of the sutra into the wooden monastery deck to quiet his heart.\nThe Sanskrit &lt;a href=\"%23Mantra\"&gt;mantra of the \"Heart S\u016btra\"&lt;/a&gt; was used as the lyrics for the opening theme song of the 2011 Chinese television series \"&lt;a href=\"Journey%20to%20the%20West%20%282011%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe 2013 Buddhist film \"&lt;a href=\"Avalokitesvara%20%28film%29\"&gt;Avalokitesvara&lt;/a&gt;,\" tells the origins of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Putuo\"&gt;Mount Putuo&lt;/a&gt;, the famous pilgrimage site for Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva in China. The film was filmed onsite on Mount Putuo and featured several segments where monks chant the Heart Sutra in Chinese and Sanskrit. &lt;a href=\"Egaku\"&gt;Egaku&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonist of the film, also chants the Heart Sutra in Japanese.\nIn the 2015 Japanese film , Koen, a twenty-four year old bookstore clerk becomes a &lt;a href=\"Shingon\"&gt;Shingon&lt;/a&gt; monk at the &lt;a href=\"Eifuku-ji\"&gt;Eifuku-ji&lt;/a&gt; after the death of his grandfather. The Eifuku-ji is the fifty-seventh temple in the eighty-eight temple &lt;a href=\"Shikoku%20Pilgrimage\"&gt;Shikoku Pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt; Circuit. He is at first unsure of himself. However, during his first service as he chants the Heart Sutra, he comes to an important realization.\n&lt;a href=\"Bear%20McCreary\"&gt;Bear McCreary&lt;/a&gt; recorded four Japanese-American monks chanting in Japanese, the entire Heart Sutra in his sound studio. He picked a few discontinuous segments and digitally enhanced them for their hypnotic sound effect. The result became the main theme of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"King%20Ghidorah\"&gt;King Ghidorah&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the 2019 film\u00a0\".\"\nInfluence on western philosophy.\n&lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Schopenhauer\"&gt;Schopenhauer&lt;/a&gt;, in the final words of his main work, compared his doctrine to the &lt;a href=\"%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81\"&gt;\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Heart S\u016btra\". In Volume 1, \u00a7 71 of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20World%20as%20Will%20and%20Representation\"&gt;The World as Will and Representation&lt;/a&gt;\", Schopenhauer wrote: \"...to those in whom the will [to continue living] has turned and has denied itself, this very real world of ours, with all its &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Milky%20Way\"&gt;Milky Way&lt;/a&gt;s, is \u2014 nothing.\" To this, he appended the following note: \"This is also the Prajna\u2013Paramita of the Buddhists, the 'beyond all knowledge,' in other words, the point where subject and object no longer exist.\""
