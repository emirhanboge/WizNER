    "text": "Ch\u00ec mi na m\u00f2rbheanna is a &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; song that was written in 1856 by Highlander John Cameron (Iain Camshroin), a native of &lt;a href=\"Ballachulish\"&gt;Ballachulish&lt;/a&gt; and known locally in the Gaelic fashion as Iain Rob and Iain \u00d2g Ruaidh. He worked in the slate quarries before moving to Glasgow where he was engaged as a ship's broker. He became the Bard of the Glasgow Ossianic Society and also Bard to Clan Cameron. He returned to carry on a merchant's business along with his elder brother and to cultivate a small croft at Taigh a' Phuirt, &lt;a href=\"Glencoe%2C%20Highland\"&gt;Glencoe&lt;/a&gt;, in his beloved Highlands. Other songs and odes appeared in &lt;a href=\"The%20Oban%20Times\"&gt;The Oban Times&lt;/a&gt; and in various song books. He was buried in St. Munda's Isle in Loch Leven. Wreaths of oak leaves and ivy covered the bier\nThe song is a longing for home and, with its wistful, calming melody and traditional ballad rhythms, is often used as a lullaby. A Gaelic arrangement of the song was recorded on Cape Breton, Nova Scotia folk singer &lt;a href=\"John%20Allan%20Cameron\"&gt;John Allan Cameron&lt;/a&gt;'s 1973 album \"Lord Of The Dance\", and &lt;a href=\"The%20Rankin%20Family\"&gt;The Rankin Family&lt;/a&gt;'s debut album (1989). The song was also played during the funerals of &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Strummer\"&gt;Joe Strummer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis song is commonly known in English as \"The Mist-Covered Mountains of Home,\" and under that title it has been recorded by many artists, including &lt;a href=\"John%20Renbourn\"&gt;John Renbourn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Knopfler\"&gt;Mark Knopfler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Cunningham\"&gt;Johnny Cunningham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nightnoise\"&gt;Nightnoise&lt;/a&gt; (at the time \"including\" Johnny Cunningham) and &lt;a href=\"Quadriga%20Consort\"&gt;Quadriga Consort&lt;/a&gt;.\nLyrics.\nHere are eight verses.\nOriginal &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Gaelic\"&gt;Scottish Gaelic&lt;/a&gt;.\nFour more verses appeared in the Oban Times in 1882&lt;br&gt;\nwritten as follows:"
