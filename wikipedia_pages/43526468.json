    "text": "The Magdeburg Confession (officially, the \"Confession, Instruction, and Admonition of the pastors and preachers of the Christian congregations of Magdeburg\") was a &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Creed\"&gt;statement of faith&lt;/a&gt;. It was written by nine pastors of the city of &lt;a href=\"Magdeburg\"&gt;Magdeburg&lt;/a&gt; in 1550 in response to the &lt;a href=\"Augsburg%20Interim\"&gt;Augsburg Interim&lt;/a&gt; and the imposition of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism\"&gt;Roman Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;. The Confession explains why the leaders of the city refused to obey the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;imperial&lt;/a&gt; law, and were prepared to resist its implementation with force if necessary. The Magdeburg Confession calls for &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20theory%20in%20the%20Early%20Modern%20period\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; to political tyranny, and argues that the \"&lt;a href=\"Lesser%20magistrate\"&gt;subordinate powers&lt;/a&gt;\" in a state, faced with the situation where the \"supreme power\" is working to destroy true religion, may go further than non-cooperation with the supreme power and assist the faithful to resist.\n&lt;a href=\"Carter%20Lindberg\"&gt;Carter Lindberg&lt;/a&gt; calls it \"the first Protestant religious justification of the right of defense against unjust higher authorities.\" &lt;a href=\"John%20Witte%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;John Witte&lt;/a&gt; notes that &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20Beza\"&gt;Theodore Beza&lt;/a&gt; saw the Magdeburg Confession as an example of how to respond to political abuse of tyranny, and that it was a \"major distillation of the most advanced Lutheran resistance theories of the day, which the Calvinist tradition absorbed.\""
