    "text": "The Riverbanks Zoo and Garden is a &lt;a href=\"zoo\"&gt;zoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"aquarium\"&gt;aquarium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"botanical%20garden\"&gt;botanical garden&lt;/a&gt; located along the &lt;a href=\"Saluda%20River\"&gt;Saluda River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Columbia, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, United States. A small portion of the zoo extends into the nearby city of &lt;a href=\"West%20Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;West Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. It is operated by the Rich-Lex Riverbanks Park &lt;a href=\"special-purpose%20district\"&gt;Special Purpose District&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership of the city of Columbia and &lt;a href=\"Richland%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Richland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lexington%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Lexington&lt;/a&gt; counties. It is overseen by the Riverbanks Park Commission, comprising two members each from the three governments and one at-large member.\nRiverbanks Zoo and Garden is an accredited member of the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Zoos%20and%20Aquariums\"&gt;Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA)&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn the early 1960s, Columbia-area businessmen conceived of a zoo for the state capital. However, the idea didn't get beyond the planning stages until 1969, when the state created the Rich-Lex Riverbanks Park Special Purpose District to run the proposed zoo. The zoo opened on April 25, 1974 after 5 years of planning. Within two years, it was obvious that the zoo would not be self-supporting, and the Riverbanks Zoological Society was created to help raise money for it. At the same time, Palmer \"Satch\" Krantz was appointed executive director. Notable features of the original Zoo design were the mountainous, moated exhibits for big cats and bears.\nRiverbanks Zoo and Garden is South Carolina's largest gated attraction, averaging over one million visitors each year\u2014a considerable amount for a zoo serving a region as small as Columbia (the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Columbia metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; has only 800,000 people). Riverbanks is a four-time winner of the Southeastern Tourism Society's Shining Example Award as the Southeast's top tourist attraction and a two-time winner of the SC Parks Recreation and Tourism Governor's Cup Award as South Carolina's Leading Attraction.\nAnimals and exhibits.\nThe zoo is home to over 2,000 animals, with collections of &lt;a href=\"mammal\"&gt;mammal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"reptile\"&gt;reptile&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;. In 2002, additions included exhibits for &lt;a href=\"African%20elephant\"&gt;African elephant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gorilla\"&gt;gorilla&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"koala\"&gt;koala&lt;/a&gt;s. The Birdhouse at Riverbanks (opened 2001) was given a Significant Achievement Award by the AZA as one of the best new zoo exhibits in the United States, and features a display of king, rockhopper, and gentoo penguins. The Zoo 2002 plan cost $15 million.\n\"African Plains\" is a exhibit featuring &lt;a href=\"giraffe\"&gt;giraffe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grant%27s%20zebra\"&gt;Grant's zebra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ostrich\"&gt;ostrich&lt;/a&gt;. From the 90s through the late 2000s, the zoo had a hippo and rhinos.\nThe \"Aquarium Reptile Complex\" (opened in 1989 as part of the Zoo II plan) is a building with a tank for Pacific coral reef species, as well as exhibits for &lt;a href=\"Galapagos%20tortoises\"&gt;Galapagos tortoises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"false%20gharial\"&gt;false gharial&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Komodo%20dragon\"&gt;Komodo dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, and other reptiles. There is a Galapagos tortoise sculpture next to it.\nOpened in 2002, \"Ndoki Forest\" was designed to house two of the larger African species, the &lt;a href=\"African%20elephant\"&gt;African elephant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"western%20lowland%20gorilla\"&gt;western lowland gorilla&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Meerkat\"&gt;slender-tailed meerkat&lt;/a&gt;, various birds, and formerly &lt;a href=\"de%20Brazza%27s%20monkey\"&gt;de Brazza's monkey&lt;/a&gt;. The elephants once lived in a renovated yard with a pool. As of November 20, 2019 the last elephant was transported to the Milwaukee County Zoo in Wisconsin. The closing of the elephant exhibit made room for a &lt;a href=\"Southern%20white%20rhino\"&gt;Southern white rhino&lt;/a&gt; exhibit, opened in Summer of 2020.\n\"Riverbanks Farm\" (opened in 1988) contains domestic animals and allows guests to feed the zoo's &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"llamas\"&gt;llamas&lt;/a&gt;. \"Lemur Island\" was a former exhibit including &lt;a href=\"ring-tailed%20lemur\"&gt;ring-tailed lemur&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"red%20ruffed%20lemur\"&gt;red ruffed lemur&lt;/a&gt;s, later replaced by the rebuilt sea lion exhibit. \"Conservation Outpost\" has threatened species such as &lt;a href=\"golden%20lion%20tamarin\"&gt;golden lion tamarin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fishing%20cat\"&gt;fishing cat&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"tree%20kangaroo\"&gt;tree kangaroo&lt;/a&gt;s. In 1983, the Education Center opened for Zoo Camp.\n\"Kangaroo Walkabout\" is another modern addition. It has a path leading into the exhibit where visitors can view &lt;a href=\"wallaby\"&gt;wallabies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"red%20kangaroo\"&gt;red kangaroo&lt;/a&gt;s without a barrier between them. However, visitors cannot stray from the path.\nThe Riverbanks Zoo added a &lt;a href=\"Malayan%20tapir\"&gt;Malayan tapir&lt;/a&gt; on January 18, 2013, since deceased; as well as a breeding pair of &lt;a href=\"babirusa\"&gt;babirusa&lt;/a&gt;s in 2012. The babirusas have successfully been bred and can be found in the previous &lt;a href=\"Common%20warthog\"&gt;warthog&lt;/a&gt; exhibit.\nIn June 2016 a new &lt;a href=\"sea%20lion\"&gt;sea lion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"harbor%20seal\"&gt;harbor seal&lt;/a&gt; exhibit was opened, which is modeled after San Francisco's &lt;a href=\"Pier%2039\"&gt;Pier 39&lt;/a&gt;. Around that time the newly renovated Entrance, renovated &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20river%20otter\"&gt;otterotter&lt;/a&gt; exhibit, and renovated &lt;a href=\"grizzly%20bear\"&gt;grizzly bear&lt;/a&gt; exhibit also opened. This was all part of the zoo's $36 million Destination Riverbanks plan.\nSeparate exhibits include &lt;a href=\"Hamadryas%20baboon\"&gt;Hamadryas baboon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Siberian%20tiger\"&gt;Siberian tiger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"meerkat\"&gt;meerkat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"American%20alligator\"&gt;alligator&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"siamang\"&gt;siamang&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe last original animal who had been there since the zoo's opening, a female &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20flamingo\"&gt;Caribbean flamingo&lt;/a&gt;, died in March 2014.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20Zoo\"&gt;Birmingham Zoo&lt;/a&gt;'s western lowland gorilla, Cenzoo was sent to this zoo in late February 2015 to breed with a female gorilla from &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Zoo\"&gt;North Carolina Zoo&lt;/a&gt; and two more female gorillas from &lt;a href=\"Zoo%20Atlanta\"&gt;Zoo Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; as part of the recommendation of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Species Survival Plan.\nhttps://www.riverbanks.org/media-center/general-info/history\nBotanical garden.\nRiverbanks also has a &lt;a href=\"botanical%20garden\"&gt;botanical garden&lt;/a&gt; (opened on June 10, 1995 at the cost of $6 million) with more than 4,200 species of native and exotic plants, and some sculptures. A trail system lets visitors explore several kilometers of bottomland and upland mixed hardwood forests in search of the native wildlife that call the Zoo and Garden home.\n&lt;a href=\"Saluda%20Factory%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Saluda Factory Historic District&lt;/a&gt;\nWaterfall Junction.\nWaterfall Junction (opened in April 2016) at Riverbanks Botanical Garden invites families and children of all ages to get outdoors and explore nature. Imagination blooms in this 3-acre wonderland where you can pop in and out of a rabbit hole, unearth a life-size replica of a T-Rex, frolic between giant tree houses and kid-size playhouses, splash around and under a 25-foot cascading waterfall and run or rest on a grassy meadow. Cool refreshments await at The Oasis concession stand."
