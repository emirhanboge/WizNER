    "text": "Positive psychological capital is defined as the positive developmental state of an individual as characterized by high &lt;a href=\"self-efficacy\"&gt;self-efficacy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"optimism\"&gt;optimism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hope\"&gt;hope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Psychological%20resilience\"&gt;resiliency&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntroduction.\nFor decades &lt;a href=\"psychology\"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt; has been associated as dealing mainly with the treatment of &lt;a href=\"Mental%20disorder\"&gt;mental illness&lt;/a&gt;, although other areas of research and application have existed since its origins. At the very end of the twentieth century a new approach in psychology gained popularity: &lt;a href=\"positive%20psychology\"&gt;positive psychology&lt;/a&gt;.\nPositive psychology, the study of optimal human functioning, is an attempt to respond to the systematic bias inherent in psychology's historical emphasis on mental illness rather than on mental wellness (Seligman, 2002), mainly by focusing on two, forgotten but classical psychological goals:\nSince &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Seligman\"&gt;Martin Seligman&lt;/a&gt;, a former head of &lt;a href=\"American%20Psychological%20Association\"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt;, chose positive psychology as the theme of his presidency term, more empirical research and theoretic development emerged in this field.\nTwo new branches of positive psychology are being implemented into the industrial-organizational world. \nDrawing from positive psychology constructs and empirical research, four psychological resources were determined to best meet the POB scientific inclusion criteria: Hope, Efficacy, Resilience, and Optimism and were termed by Luthans and colleagues as psychological Capital or PsyCap Positive In combination, the four constructs making up PsyCap were empirically determined to be a second-order, core construct that had a stronger relationship with satisfaction and performance than each of the components by itself. The four components are defined as follows:\nLuthans (2014) refers to these four criteria-meeting positive psychological resources which comprise psychological capital as the \"HERO Within\".\nRelationship with different organizational outcomes.\nPsyCap has positive correlation with desired employee attitudes, behaviors and performance.\nA meta-analysis of 51 independent samples found strong, significant, positive relationship between PsyCap and desirable attitudes (e.g., satisfaction, commitment, and well-being), behaviors (e.g., citizenship) and performance (self, supervisor rated, and objective) and a negative relationship with undesirable attitudes (e.g., cynicism, stress, anxiety, and turnover intentions) and behaviors (e.g., deviance).\nPsyCap mediates between supportive climate and employee performance - Psycap\nPsyCap and positive supportive climate are necessary for human resources in order to achieve stable organizational growth. Supportive climate is defined as the total support that an employee receives from their coworkers, other departments and their supervisors which helps them with their job demands.\nHigh PsyCap Employees supports effective organizational change\nOrganizational change is defined as a lack of fit with the environment which intensifies as a result of a gap between the organizational goals and its present outcomes. The employees have the responsibility to adjust and behave according to the new strategy dictated by the management, mostly with fewer resources. During change, different aspects of employees\u2019 PsyCap is put to the test \u2013 they have to learn new ways of behavior and be confident to do so, recover from the crisis, be motivated to cope efficiently and to believe in a better future. PsyCap and positive emotions are examples of how personal factors facilitate organizational change. Positive change is defined as every change that the organization undergoes for its own benefit and has more positive psychological and behavioral consequences than negative ones. The role of positive emotions is that they help workers cope with the organizational change by broadening their point of view, encourage open decision making and giving them essential vitality for their coping.\nThis interaction means that PsyCap, through positive emotions, influences the worker's attitudes and behavior, which in turn, influences the organizational change.\nPsyCap can be developed\nBoth experimental and longitudinal research indicates the state-like nature of PsyCap and that it can be developed and cause performance to improve.\nPsyCap can be extended beyond work into other life domains such as relationships and health\nRecent research has found that measures of \"Relationship PsyCap\" and \"Health PsyCap\" are related to both individual's respective satisfaction appraisals and desired objective outcomes such as time spent with family and friend in the cases of relationships and cholesterol and BMI in the case of health. When combined with work satisfaction, these three are related to overall well-being.\nNow after almost a decade of theory building and research, PsyCap is widely recognized throughout the world and is being applied in positive leadership and human resource development and performance management programs in all types of organizations - businesses, health, education, military and athletics."
