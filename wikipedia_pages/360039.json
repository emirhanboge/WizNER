    "title": "Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon",
    "text": "Georges-Louis Leclerc, &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Comte&lt;/a&gt; de Buffon (; 7 September 1707 \u2013 16 April 1788) was a &lt;a href=\"French%20people\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Natural%20history\"&gt;naturalist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mathematician\"&gt;mathematician&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cosmology\"&gt;cosmologist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Encyclop%C3%A9distes\"&gt;encyclop\u00e9diste&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis works influenced the next two generations of naturalists, including two prominent French scientists &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Lamarck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Cuvier\"&gt;Georges Cuvier&lt;/a&gt;. Buffon published thirty-six &lt;a href=\"quarto\"&gt;quarto&lt;/a&gt; volumes of his \"&lt;a href=\"Histoire%20Naturelle\"&gt;Histoire Naturelle&lt;/a&gt;\" during his lifetime, with additional volumes based on his notes and further research being published in the two decades following his death.\n&lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Mayr\"&gt;Ernst Mayr&lt;/a&gt; wrote that \"Truly, Buffon was the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the 18th century\". Credited with being one of the first naturalists to recognize &lt;a href=\"ecological%20succession\"&gt;ecological succession&lt;/a&gt;, he was later forced by the theology committee at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Paris\"&gt;University of Paris&lt;/a&gt; to recant his theories about geological history and animal evolution because they contradicted the Biblical narrative of Creation.\nBuffon held the position of \"intendant\" (director) at the Jardin du Roi, now called the &lt;a href=\"Jardin%20des%20Plantes\"&gt;Jardin des Plantes&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nGeorges Louis Leclerc (later Comte de Buffon) was born at &lt;a href=\"Montbard\"&gt;Montbard&lt;/a&gt;, in the Province of &lt;a href=\"Burgundy%20%28historical%20region%29\"&gt;Burgundy&lt;/a&gt; to Benjamin Francois Leclerc, a minor local official in charge of the &lt;a href=\"salt%20tax\"&gt;salt tax&lt;/a&gt; and Anne-Christine Marlin also from a family of civil servants. Georges was named after his mother's uncle (his godfather) Georges Blaisot, the tax-farmer of the Duke of Savoy for all of &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt;. In 1714 Blaisot died childless, leaving a considerable fortune to his seven-year-old godson. Benjamin Leclerc then purchased an estate containing the nearby village of &lt;a href=\"Buffon%2C%20C%C3%B4te-d%27Or\"&gt;Buffon&lt;/a&gt; and moved the family to Dijon acquiring various offices there as well as a seat in the Dijon Parlement.\nGeorges attended the Jesuit College of Godrans in Dijon from the age of ten onwards. From 1723 to 1726 he then studied law in Dijon, the prerequisite for continuing the family tradition in civil service. In 1728 Georges left Dijon to study mathematics and medicine at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Angers\"&gt;University of Angers&lt;/a&gt; in France. At Angers in 1730 he made the acquaintance of the young English &lt;a href=\"Evelyn%20Pierrepont%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Kingston-upon-Hull\"&gt;Duke of Kingston&lt;/a&gt;, who was on his grand tour of Europe, and traveled with him on a large and expensive entourage for a year and a half through southern France and parts of Italy.\nThere are persistent but completely undocumented rumors from this period about duels, abductions and secret trips to England. In 1732 after the death of his mother and before the impending remarriage of his father, Georges left Kingston and returned to Dijon to secure his inheritance. Having added 'de Buffon' to his name while traveling with the Duke, he repurchased the village of Buffon, which his father had meanwhile sold off. With a fortune of about 80,000 &lt;a href=\"French%20livre\"&gt;livres&lt;/a&gt; Buffon set himself up in Paris to pursue science, at first primarily mathematics and mechanics, and the increase of his fortune.\nCareer.\nIn 1732 he moved to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, where he made the acquaintance of &lt;a href=\"Voltaire\"&gt;Voltaire&lt;/a&gt; and other intellectuals. He lived in the &lt;a href=\"Faubourg%20Saint-Germain\"&gt;Faubourg Saint-Germain&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Gilles-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Boulduc\"&gt;Gilles-Fran\u00e7ois Boulduc&lt;/a&gt;, first apothecary of the King, professor of chemistry at the &lt;a href=\"Jardin%20du%20Roi\"&gt;Royal Garden of Plants&lt;/a&gt;, member of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. He first made his mark in the field of mathematics and, in his (\"On the game of fair-square\"), introduced differential and integral &lt;a href=\"calculus\"&gt;calculus&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"probability%20theory\"&gt;probability theory&lt;/a&gt;; the problem of &lt;a href=\"Buffon%27s%20needle\"&gt;Buffon's needle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"probability%20theory\"&gt;probability theory&lt;/a&gt; is named after him. In 1734 he was admitted to the &lt;a href=\"French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;French Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. During this period he corresponded with the Swiss mathematician &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Cramer\"&gt;Gabriel Cramer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis protector &lt;a href=\"Jean-Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Ph%C3%A9lypeaux%2C%20Count%20of%20Maurepas\"&gt;Maurepas&lt;/a&gt; had asked the Academy of Sciences to do research on wood for the construction of ships in 1733. Soon afterward, Buffon began a long-term study, performing some of the most comprehensive tests to date on the mechanical properties of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;. Included were a series of tests to compare the properties of small specimens with those of large members. After carefully testing more than a thousand small specimens without knots or other defects, Buffon concluded that it was not possible to extrapolate to the properties of full-size timbers, and he began a series of tests on full-size structural members.\nIn 1739 he was appointed head of the Parisian &lt;a href=\"Jardin%20des%20plantes%23The%20Buffon%20period%20%281739-1788%29\"&gt;Jardin du Roi&lt;/a&gt; with the help of Maurepas; he held this position to the end of his life. Buffon was instrumental in transforming the Jardin du Roi into a major research center and museum. He also enlarged it, arranging the purchase of adjoining plots of land and acquiring new botanical and zoological specimens from all over the world.\nThanks to his talent as a writer, he was invited to join Paris's second great academy, the &lt;a href=\"Acad%C3%A9mie%20fran%C3%A7aise\"&gt;Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise&lt;/a&gt; in 1753 and then in 1768 he was elected to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Philosophical%20Society\"&gt;American Philosophical Society&lt;/a&gt;. In his (\"Discourse on Style\"), pronounced before the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, he said, \"Writing well consists of thinking, feeling and expressing well, of clarity of mind, soul and taste\u00a0... The style is the man himself\" (\"\"). Unfortunately for him, Buffon's reputation as a literary stylist also gave ammunition to his detractors: The mathematician &lt;a href=\"Jean%20le%20Rond%20D%27Alembert\"&gt;Jean le Rond D'Alembert&lt;/a&gt;, for example, called him \"the great phrase-monger\".\nIn 1752 Buffon married Marie-Fran\u00e7oise de Saint-Belin-Malain, the daughter of an impoverished noble family from Burgundy, who had been enrolled in the convent school run by his sister. Madame de Buffon's second child, a son born in 1764, survived childhood; she herself died in 1769. When in 1772 Buffon became seriously ill and the promise that his son (then only 8) should succeed him as director of the Jardin became clearly impracticable and was withdrawn, the King raised Buffon's estates in Burgundy to the status of a county \u2013 and thus Buffon (and his son) became a &lt;a href=\"count\"&gt;count&lt;/a&gt;. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in 1782. Buffon died in Paris in 1788.\nHe was buried in a chapel adjacent to the church of Sainte-Urse Montbard; during the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, his tomb was broken into and the lead that covered the coffin was ransacked to produce bullets. His &lt;a href=\"heart\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; was initially saved, as it was guarded by &lt;a href=\"Suzanne%20Necker\"&gt;Suzanne Necker&lt;/a&gt; (wife of &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Necker\"&gt;Jacques Necker&lt;/a&gt;), but was later lost. Today, only Buffon's &lt;a href=\"cerebellum\"&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt; remains, as it is kept in the base of the statue by &lt;a href=\"Pajou\"&gt;Pajou&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XVI\"&gt;Louis XVI&lt;/a&gt; had commissioned in his honor in 1776, located at the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Natural%20History\"&gt;Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorks.\nBuffon's \"&lt;a href=\"Histoire%20naturelle\"&gt;Histoire naturelle, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et particuli\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;\" (1749\u20131788: in 36 volumes; an additional volume based on his notes appeared in 1789) was originally intended to cover all three \"kingdoms\" of nature but the \"Histoire naturelle\" ended up being limited to the animal and mineral kingdoms, and the animals covered were only the birds and quadrupeds. \"Written in a brilliant style, this work was read ... by every educated person in Europe\". Those who assisted him in the production of this great work included &lt;a href=\"Louis-Jean-Marie%20Daubenton\"&gt;Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton&lt;/a&gt;, Philibert Gu\u00e9neau de Montbeillard, and Gabriel-L\u00e9opold Bexon, along with numerous artists. Buffon's was translated into many different languages, making him one of the most widely read authors of the day, a rival to &lt;a href=\"Montesquieu\"&gt;Montesquieu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rousseau\"&gt;Rousseau&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Voltaire\"&gt;Voltaire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the opening volumes of the \"Histoire naturelle\" Buffon questioned the usefulness of mathematics, criticized &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Carl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt;'s taxonomical approach to natural history, outlined a history of the Earth with little relation to the Biblical account, and proposed a theory of reproduction that ran counter to the prevailing theory of &lt;a href=\"Preformationism\"&gt;pre-existence&lt;/a&gt;. The early volumes were condemned by the Faculty of Theology at the Sorbonne. Buffon published a retraction, but he continued publishing the offending volumes without any change.\nIn the course of his examination of the animal world, Buffon noted that despite similar environments, different regions have distinct plants and animals, a concept later known as Buffon's Law. This is considered to be the first principle of &lt;a href=\"biogeography\"&gt;biogeography&lt;/a&gt;. He made the suggestion that species may have both \"improved\" and \"degenerated\" after dispersing from a center of creation. In volume 14 he argued that all the world's &lt;a href=\"quadruped\"&gt;quadruped&lt;/a&gt;s had developed from an original set of just thirty-eight quadrupeds. On this basis, he is sometimes considered a \"&lt;a href=\"Transmutation%20of%20species\"&gt;transformist&lt;/a&gt;\" and a precursor of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Darwin\"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;. He also asserted that &lt;a href=\"Climate%20change%20%28general%20concept%29\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; may have facilitated the worldwide spread of species from their centers of origin. Still, interpreting his ideas on the subject is not simple, for he returned to topics many times in the course of his work.\nBuffon considered the similarities between humans and apes, but ultimately rejected the possibility of a &lt;a href=\"common%20descent\"&gt;common descent&lt;/a&gt;. He debated with &lt;a href=\"James%20Burnett%2C%20Lord%20Monboddo\"&gt;James Burnett, Lord Monboddo&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship of the primates to man, Monboddo insisting, against Buffon, on a close relationship.\nAt one point, Buffon propounded a theory that nature in the &lt;a href=\"New%20World\"&gt;New World&lt;/a&gt; was inferior to that of &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt;. He argued that the Americas were lacking in large and powerful creatures, and that even the people were less virile than their European counterparts. He ascribed this inferiority to the marsh odors and dense forests of the American continent. These remarks so incensed &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Jefferson\"&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; that he dispatched twenty soldiers to the &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire\"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; woods to find a bull &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt; for Buffon as proof of the \"stature and majesty of American quadrupeds\".\nIn \"Les \u00e9poques de la nature\" (1778) Buffon discussed the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Solar%20System\"&gt;Solar System&lt;/a&gt;, speculating that the planets had been created by a &lt;a href=\"comet\"&gt;comet&lt;/a&gt;'s collision with the Sun. He also suggested that the &lt;a href=\"age%20of%20the%20Earth\"&gt;Earth originated&lt;/a&gt; much earlier than 4004 BC, the date determined by Archbishop &lt;a href=\"James%20Ussher\"&gt;James Ussher&lt;/a&gt;. Basing his figures on the cooling rate of &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; tested at his Laboratory the at &lt;a href=\"Montbard\"&gt;Montbard&lt;/a&gt;, he calculated that the age of the Earth was 75,000 years. Once again, his ideas were condemned by the &lt;a href=\"Sorbonne\"&gt;Sorbonne&lt;/a&gt;, and once again he issued a retraction to avoid further problems.\nRacial studies.\nBuffon and &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Blumenbach\"&gt;Johann Blumenbach&lt;/a&gt; were believers in &lt;a href=\"monogenism\"&gt;monogenism&lt;/a&gt;, the concept that all races have a single origin. They also believed in the \"degeneration theory\" of racial origins. They both said that &lt;a href=\"Adam%20and%20Eve\"&gt;Adam and Eve&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"Caucasian%20race\"&gt;Caucasian&lt;/a&gt; and that other races came about by &lt;a href=\"Social%20degeneration\"&gt;degeneration&lt;/a&gt; from environmental factors, such as the sun and poor diet. They believed that the degeneration could be reversed if proper environmental control was taken, and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original &lt;a href=\"Caucasian%20race\"&gt;Caucasian race&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuffon and Blumenbach claimed that &lt;a href=\"pigmentation\"&gt;pigmentation&lt;/a&gt; arose because of the heat of the tropical sun. They suggested cold wind caused the tawny colour of the &lt;a href=\"Eskimos\"&gt;Eskimos&lt;/a&gt;. They thought the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20people\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; relatively fair-skinned compared to the other Asian stocks because they kept mostly in towns and were protected from environmental factors. Buffon said that food and the mode of living could make races degenerate and distinguish them from the original Caucasian race.\nBelieving in monogenism, Buffon thought that skin color could change in a single lifetime, depending on the conditions of climate and diet.\nBuffon was an advocate of the &lt;a href=\"Asia%20hypothesis\"&gt;Asia hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;; in his \"Histoire Naturelle\", he argued that humans' birthplace must be in a high temperate zone. As he believed good climate conditions would breed healthy humans, he hypothesized that the most logical place to look for the first humans' existence would be in Asia and around the &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20Sea\"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt; region.\nRelevance to modern biology.\n&lt;a href=\"Charles%20Darwin\"&gt;Charles Darwin&lt;/a&gt; wrote in his preliminary historical sketch added to the third edition of \"&lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species\"&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/a&gt;\": \"Passing over ... Buffon, with whose writings I am not familiar\". Then, from the fourth edition onwards, he amended this to say that \"the first author who in modern times has treated it [evolution] in a scientific spirit was Buffon. But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species, I need not here enter on details\". Buffon's work on degeneration, however, was immensely influential on later scholars but was overshadowed by strong moral overtones.\nThe paradox of Buffon is that, according to &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Mayr\"&gt;Ernst Mayr&lt;/a&gt;:\nBuffon wrote about the concept of &lt;a href=\"struggle%20for%20existence\"&gt;struggle for existence&lt;/a&gt;. He developed a system of &lt;a href=\"heredity\"&gt;heredity&lt;/a&gt; which was similar to Darwin's hypothesis of &lt;a href=\"pangenesis\"&gt;pangenesis&lt;/a&gt;. Commenting on Buffon's views, Darwin stated, \"If Buffon had assumed that his organic molecules had been formed by each separate unit throughout the body, his view and mine would have been very closely similar.\"\nWorks.\nBuffon, \"\u0152uvres\", ed.
