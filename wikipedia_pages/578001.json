    "text": "Romancing the Stone is a 1984 &lt;a href=\"action%20film\"&gt;action&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"adventure%20film\"&gt;adventure&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"romantic%20comedy\"&gt;romantic comedy&lt;/a&gt; film directed by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Zemeckis\"&gt;Robert Zemeckis&lt;/a&gt;, written by &lt;a href=\"Diane%20Thomas\"&gt;Diane Thomas&lt;/a&gt; and produced by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Douglas\"&gt;Michael Douglas&lt;/a&gt; who also starred in the film. The film co-stars &lt;a href=\"Kathleen%20Turner\"&gt;Kathleen Turner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Danny%20DeVito\"&gt;Danny DeVito&lt;/a&gt;. \nThomas wrote the screenplay in 1979, her only screenplay to be produced in her lifetime. Zemeckis, who at the time was developing \"&lt;a href=\"Cocoon%20%28film%29\"&gt;Cocoon&lt;/a&gt;\", liked Thomas' screenplay and offered to direct but &lt;a href=\"20th%20Century%20Fox\"&gt;20th Century Fox&lt;/a&gt; initially declined, citing the commercial failure of his first two films \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Wanna%20Hold%20Your%20Hand%20%28film%29\"&gt;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Used%20Cars\"&gt;Used Cars&lt;/a&gt;\". The director would eventually be dismissed from \"Cocoon\" after an early screening of \"Romancing the Stone\" failed to further impress studio executives. &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Silvestri\"&gt;Alan Silvestri&lt;/a&gt;, who would collaborate with Zemeckis on his later films, composed the film's score.\n\"Romancing the Stone\" was released on March 30, 1984, to positive reviews from critics and earned over $115 million worldwide at the &lt;a href=\"box%20office\"&gt;box office&lt;/a&gt;. It was followed by a 1985 &lt;a href=\"sequel\"&gt;sequel&lt;/a&gt; titled \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20of%20the%20Nile\"&gt;The Jewel of the Nile&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPlot.\nJoan Wilder is a successful, but lonely, romance novelist in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. After finishing her latest novel, Joan leaves her apartment to meet her editor, Gloria. On the way she is handed a letter that contains a map, sent by her recently murdered brother-in-law, Eduardo. While she is gone, a man tries to break into her apartment and is discovered by her apartment supervisor, whom he kills. Returning to her apartment, Joan finds it ransacked. She then receives a frantic phone call from her sister Elaine\u2014Eduardo's widow. Elaine has been kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"antiquities\"&gt;antiquities&lt;/a&gt; smugglers, cousins Ira and Ralph, and instructs Joan to go to the Colombian coastal city of &lt;a href=\"Cartagena%2C%20Colombia\"&gt;Cartagena&lt;/a&gt; with the map she received; it is Elaine's ransom.\nFlying to Colombia, Joan is diverted from the rendezvous point by Colonel Zolo\u2014the same man that ransacked her apartment looking for the map\u2014by tricking her into boarding the wrong bus. Instead of heading to Cartagena, this bus goes deep into the interior of the country. Ralph realizes this and begins following Joan. After Joan accidentally distracts the bus driver by asking where they are going, the bus crashes into a Land Rover, wrecking both vehicles. As the rest of the passengers walk away, Joan is menaced by Zolo but is saved by the Land Rover's owner: an American exotic bird smuggler named Jack T. Colton. For getting her out of the jungle and to a telephone, Joan promises to pay Jack $375 in &lt;a href=\"traveler%27s%20cheque\"&gt;traveler's cheque&lt;/a&gt;s.\nJack and Joan travel the jungle while eluding Zolo and his &lt;a href=\"military%20police\"&gt;military police&lt;/a&gt;. Reaching a small village, they encounter a drug lord named Juan, who is a big fan of Joan's novels and happily helps them escape from Zolo.\nAfter a night of dancing and passion in a nearby town, Jack suggests to Joan that they find the treasure themselves before handing over the map. Zolo's men enter the town, so Jack and Joan steal a car to escape\u2014but it is Ralph's car, and he is sleeping in the back. They follow the clues and retrieve the treasure: an enormous &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt; called \"El Coraz\u00f3n\" (\"The Heart\"). Ralph takes the emerald from them at gunpoint, but Zolo's forces appear, distracting Ralph long enough for Jack to steal the jewel back. After being chased into a river and over a waterfall, Jack and Joan are separated on opposite sides of the raging river; Joan has the map, but Jack has the emerald. Jack directs Joan to Cartagena, promising that he will meet her there.\nIn Cartagena, Joan meets with Ira, who takes the map and releases Elaine. But Zolo and his men arrive, with a captured Jack and a severely beaten Ralph. As Zolo tortures Joan, Jack tries to throw the emerald into a crocodile pool behind Zolo. Zolo is able to catch the emerald, but then a crocodile jumps up and bites his hand off, swallowing the emerald with it. A shootout ensues between Zolo's soldiers and Ira's gang. Joan and Elaine dash for safety, pursued by the maimed Zolo, as Jack tries to stop the crocodile from escaping; he begrudgingly lets it go to try and save Joan.\nA crazed Zolo charges at Joan; she dodges his wild knife slashes and he falls into a crocodile pit. As the authorities arrive, Ira and his men escape, but Ralph is left behind. After a kiss, Jack dives into the water after the crocodile with the emerald, leaving Joan behind with her sister.\nLater, Joan is back in New York City, and has written a new novel based on her adventure. Gloria\u2014Joan's publisher\u2014is moved to tears by the story and tells Joan she has another best-seller on her hands. Returning home, she finds Jack waiting for her in a sailboat named the \"Angelina\", after the heroine of Joan's novels, and wearing boots made from the crocodile's skin. He jokes that the crocodile got \"a fatal case of indigestion\" from the emerald, which he sold, using the money to buy the boat of his dreams. They go off together, planning to sail around the world.\nProduction.\nScreenplay.\nThe screenplay for \"Romancing\" was written five years earlier by a &lt;a href=\"Malibu%2C%20California\"&gt;Malibu&lt;/a&gt; waitress named &lt;a href=\"Diane%20Thomas\"&gt;Diane Thomas&lt;/a&gt; in what would end up being her only screenplay made into a movie. She died in a car crash a year and a half after the film's release.\nCasting.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvester%20Stallone\"&gt;Sylvester Stallone&lt;/a&gt; was originally considered for the role of Jack T. Colton.\nFilming.\nFilming locations for \"Romancing the Stone\" included &lt;a href=\"Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico (Fort of &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20de%20Ul%C3%BAa\"&gt;San Juan de Ul\u00faa&lt;/a&gt;); and &lt;a href=\"Huasca%20de%20Ocampo\"&gt;Huasca de Ocampo&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico. Parts of the film were also shot in &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Canyon%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Snow Canyon, Utah&lt;/a&gt;. The scene where Turner and Douglas get separated on opposite banks on a &lt;a href=\"whitewater\"&gt;whitewater&lt;/a&gt; river, about two-thirds into the movie, was filmed on the Rio Antigua near the town of &lt;a href=\"Jalcomulco\"&gt;Jalcomulco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veracruz\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt;.\nTurner later said of the film's production, \"I remember terrible arguments [with Robert Zemeckis] doing \"Romancing\". He's a film-school grad, fascinated by cameras and effects. I never felt that he knew what I was having to do to adjust my acting to some of his damn cameras \u2013 sometimes he puts you in ridiculous postures. I'd say, 'This is not helping me! This is not the way I like to work, thank you!'\" Despite their difficulties on the film, Zemeckis would go on to work with Turner again, casting her as the voice of Jessica Rabbit in 1988's \"&lt;a href=\"Who%20Framed%20Roger%20Rabbit\"&gt;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;\".\nReception.\nBox office.\nStudio insiders expected \"Romancing the Stone\" to flop (to the point that, after viewing a rough cut of the film, the producers of the then-under-development \"&lt;a href=\"Cocoon%20%28film%29\"&gt;Cocoon&lt;/a&gt;\" fired Zemeckis as director of that film), but the film became a surprise hit. It became &lt;a href=\"20th%20Century%20Fox\"&gt;20th Century Fox&lt;/a&gt;'s only big hit of 1984. Zemeckis later stated that the success of \"Romancing the Stone\" allowed him to make \"&lt;a href=\"Back%20to%20the%20Future\"&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCritical reaction.\n\"Romancing the Stone\" holds an 85% approval rating on the review aggregation website &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Tomatoes\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, based on 52 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Romancing the Stone\" reaches back to the classic Saturday morning serials of old with an action-filled adventure enlivened by the sparkling chemistry between its well-matched leads.\"\nUpon the release of \"Romancing the Stone\", \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine called the film \"a distaff \"&lt;a href=\"Raiders%20of%20the%20Lost%20Ark\"&gt;Raiders&lt;/a&gt;\" rip-off\". \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" remarked that \"Though fitfully thrilling and amusing, [Joan Wilder's] adventures degenerate into a muddle. Neither screenwriter Diane Thomas nor director Robert Zemeckis, good-humored as they strive to be, maintains a coherent perception of how the plot should be contrived to trump the heroine's overactive fantasy life.\" They elaborated that the stone makes an uncompelling &lt;a href=\"MacGuffin\"&gt;MacGuffin&lt;/a&gt;, Joan's character development is incongruous and ultimately unsatisfying, and Joan and Jack lack romantic chemistry. By contrast, \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time Out&lt;/a&gt;\" commented that \"The script is sharp and funny, the direction sure-footed on both the comedy and action fronts,\" and compared the film favorably to its contemporary in the same genre, \"&lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Temple%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Ebert\"&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/a&gt; called it \"a silly, high-spirited chase picture\", saying he greatly enjoyed the film's imaginative perils, colorful cast of villains, and believable relationship between its two lead characters. He likewise compared it favorably to other \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" clones.\n&lt;a href=\"Colin%20Greenland\"&gt;Colin Greenland&lt;/a&gt; reviewed \"Romancing the Stone\" for \"&lt;a href=\"Imagine%20%28game%20magazine%29\"&gt;Imagine&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine, and stated that \"Good-humoured, sparky stuff in the manner of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\".\"\n&lt;a href=\"Filmsite.org\"&gt;Filmsite.org&lt;/a&gt; included it as one of the best films of 1984, and \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\" included it on their list of films that made 1984 one of the best years for Hollywood films.\nThen-&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20President\"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Reagan\"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; viewed this film at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20David\"&gt;Camp David&lt;/a&gt; in May 1984.\nAwards.\nAward wins:\nAward nominations:\nIn other media.\nBooks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"novelization\"&gt;novelization&lt;/a&gt; of \"Romancing the Stone\" was credited to Joan Wilder, although (along with a novelization of the sequel movie, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20of%20the%20Nile\"&gt;The Jewel of the Nile&lt;/a&gt;\") it was actually written by Catherine Lanigan.\nSequels.\nThe success of \"Romancing the Stone\" led to a sequel that was equally successful commercially, 1985's \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20of%20the%20Nile\"&gt;The Jewel of the Nile&lt;/a&gt;\", without Zemeckis at the helm but with Douglas, Turner and DeVito all returning. Another sequel, called \"The Crimson Eagle\", never made it past the development stage. This planned yet unproduced sequel would have seen Jack Colton and his partner Joan Wilder take their two teenage children to Thailand where they would find themselves blackmailed into stealing a priceless statue. Filming was scheduled to begin in 1987, following Michael Douglas' shooting of \"&lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street%20%281987%20film%29\"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;\", but the production was delayed. DeVito reunited Douglas, Turner, and himself in his 1989 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20War%20of%20the%20Roses%20%28film%29\"&gt;The War of the Roses&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2005 and again in 2008, Douglas was working on a second sequel to \"Romancing the Stone\" entitled \"Racing the Monsoon\".\nSince 2007, 20th Century Fox considered a remake of \"Romancing the Stone\" with the possibility of a \"reboot\" of a series. The roles of Jack Colton and Joan Wilder would be filled by &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20Kitsch\"&gt;Taylor Kitsch&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Butler\"&gt;Gerard Butler&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Heigl\"&gt;Katherine Heigl&lt;/a&gt;. By 2011, the remake was re-worked as a television series."
