    "text": "Jalaram Bapa () popularly known as Bapa () (4 November 1799 (Samvat 1856) \u2013 23 February 1881 (Samvat 1937)) was a &lt;a href=\"Hindu\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; saint from &lt;a href=\"Gujarat\"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt;, India. He was born on 4 November 1799, one week after the &lt;a href=\"Hindu\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; festival of &lt;a href=\"Diwali\"&gt;Diwali&lt;/a&gt;, which is associated with his &lt;a href=\"I%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADa-devat%C4%81\"&gt;I\u1e63\u1e6da-devat\u0101&lt;/a&gt; Lord &lt;a href=\"Rama\"&gt;Rama&lt;/a&gt;. He is mainly worshipped in Gujarat, but his words and miracles have spread throughout India and many other countries. Thursday is the day that is associated with him in Hinduism. Images of Jalaram Bapa usually portray him as wearing white, with a stick in his left hand and a tulsi &lt;a href=\"Japamala\"&gt;mala&lt;/a&gt; in his right hand. He is always dressed in simple clothes, to represent that he was a pure person. \nLife.\nJalaram Bapa was born in &lt;a href=\"Virpur%20%28Rajkot%29\"&gt;Virpur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rajkot%20district\"&gt;Rajkot district&lt;/a&gt;, Gujarat, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; in 1799, on the seventh day of the &lt;a href=\"Kartika%20%28month%29\"&gt;Kartika&lt;/a&gt; month. His father was Pradhan Thakkar and his mother was Rajbai Thakkar who belonged to &lt;a href=\"Lohana\"&gt;Lohana&lt;/a&gt; clan. He was a devotee of the Hindu god &lt;a href=\"Rama\"&gt;Rama&lt;/a&gt;.\nJalaram Bapa was however not willing to live a householder's life and continued to take care of his father's business. He was mostly engaged in serving &lt;a href=\"pilgrims\"&gt;pilgrims&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sadhus\"&gt;sadhus&lt;/a&gt; and saints. He separated himself from his father's business and his uncle Valjibhai asked Jalaram Bapa and his wife Virbai to stay in his house.\nAt the age of sixteen, in 1816, Jalaram married Virbai, the daughter of Pragjibhai Thakkar (Somaiya) of &lt;a href=\"Atkot\"&gt;Atkot&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was inclined to completely withdraw from materialistic life and become an ascetic, Virbai proved to be an asset to him in his works of feeding poor and needy.\nAt the age of 18, soon after returning from pilgrimage to &lt;a href=\"Hindu\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; holy places, Jalaram Bapa became the disciple of &lt;a href=\"Bhoja%20Bhagat\"&gt;Bhoja Bhagat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Fatehpur%2C%20Gujarat\"&gt;Fatehpur&lt;/a&gt;, who accepted him as his disciple. Jalaram was given the &lt;a href=\"mantra\"&gt;Guru Mantra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20prayer%20beads\"&gt;japa mala&lt;/a&gt; in the name of &lt;a href=\"Rama\"&gt;Rama&lt;/a&gt; by his &lt;a href=\"Guru\"&gt;Guru&lt;/a&gt; Bhojalram. With blessings of his guru, he started \"Sadavrat\", a feeding centre, a place where all sadhus and saints as well as the needy could have food any time.\nOne day, a &lt;a href=\"sadhu\"&gt;sadhu&lt;/a&gt; who came to his house gave him a deity of Lord Rama, forecasting that &lt;a href=\"Hanuman\"&gt;Hanuman&lt;/a&gt;, the monkey-god and devotee of Rama, would follow soon. Jalaram Bapa installed Rama as his family deity and after a few days, a deity of Hanuman appeared out of earth, on its own. The deity of Rama's consort &lt;a href=\"Sita\"&gt;Sita&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href=\"Lakshmana\"&gt;Lakshmana&lt;/a&gt; also appeared. Due to a miracle the container in the house of Jalaram, where grains were stored, became inexhaustible. Later other devotees and village folk joined him in his works of human welfare.\nJalaram bapa\u2019s fame spread as a divine incarnation. Whoever came to Virpur, whether &lt;a href=\"Hindu\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; irrespective of caste, creed and religion were fed by Jalaram. This tradition of feeding people continues to this day in Virpur.\nIt is believed that once a tailor named Haraji, who was suffering from severe stomach-ache came to him to get himself cured. Jalaram Bapa prayed to God and Haraji was cured. He fell at Jalaram Bapa's feet and addressed him as \"Bapa\". Since then he was known as \"Jalaram Bapa.\" Soon his fame spread and people came to him to get rid of diseases and problems. Jalaram Bapa would pray for them in the name of Rama and miracles happened. Both Hindus and Muslims became his disciples. In 1822, Jamal, son of a rich Muslim merchant fell ill and doctors gave up all hope. At that point of time, Haraji, told Jamal of his experience (\"parcha\"). Jamal, prayed from his house, that if his son is cured of the disease, he would give 40 &lt;a href=\"maunds\"&gt;maunds&lt;/a&gt; of grain to Jalaram Bapa for \"sadavrat\". His son recovered and Jamal visited house of Jalaram Bapa with cart load of grains and called him \"Jalla so &lt;a href=\"Allah\"&gt;Allah&lt;/a&gt;!\".\nIt is said that at one time, God in the guise of an old saint told Jalaram to send Virbai to serve him. Jalaram consulted her and with her consent, sent her with the saint. But after walking some miles and reaching a nearby forest, the saint asked Virbai to wait for him. She waited but saint did not return. Instead, she heard an &lt;a href=\"Akashvani%20%28term%29\"&gt;Akashwani&lt;/a&gt; stating that it was only to test the hospitality of the couple. Before the saint disappeared, he left a \"Danda\" [staff] and \"Jholi\" [cloth bag], with Virbai. Virbai returned home to Jalaram, as instructed by the celestial voice with \"Danda\" &amp; \"Jholi\". This \"Danda\" and \"Jholi\" are still at Virpur and kept on display in a glass enclosure.\nJalaram Bapa passed away on February 23, 1881 at the age of 81. Some of his devout followers believe that even after his death, Jalaram Bapa would make unusual miracles happen. One of these being that he fed one of his sisters water, a few hours after he breathed his last.\nFamily.\nJalaram Bapa and Virbai had a daughter named Jamnaben from their marriage. Jamnaben's grandson Harirambhai was adopted by Shri Jalaram Bapa and his direct descendant, Giridhar Bapa and his son Jaisukhram Bapa and Raghuram Bapa now head the &lt;a href=\"Gadi%20%28seat%29\"&gt;gadi&lt;/a&gt; of revered Virpur shrine of Jalaram Bapa.\nVirpur.\nVirpur was the workplace of Shri Jalaram Bapa. The main shrine of Jalaram Bapa is located at Virpur. The shrine is actually the house complex where Jalaram lived during his lifetime. The shrine houses the belongings of Jalaram and the deities of Rama, Sita, Lakshman and Hanuman worshipped by him. It also has on display the \"Jholi\" and \"Danda\" said to have been given to him by God. But the main attraction here is the portrait of Jalaram Bapa. There is also an actual black and white photo of Jalaram Bapa, taken a year before his death.\nThe temple is one of a kind in the world in a way that it has not been accepting any offerings since February 9, 2000.\nParchas.\nToday, devotees of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//santjalaram.in\"&gt;Jalaram&lt;/a&gt; have experienced that if they pray to the saint sincerely, he blesses them and fulfils their wishes. These experiences are known as \"Parcha\"s. They pray to Jalaram Bapa and if their wish is fulfilled they fast, and visit a temple on Thursday. There are many devotees of Jalaram Bapa who worship him like a God, similar to &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Baba%20of%20Shirdi\"&gt;Sai Baba of Shirdi&lt;/a&gt;.\nSo far, there is only one book written on Shri Jalaram Bapa's Tales of Miracles by Author Chirag Sheth &amp; Yuvraj Sheth, which is available on most online websites.\nJalaram Jayanti.\nJalaram Bapa's birthday is celebrated on 7th day &lt;a href=\"Shukla%20paksha\"&gt;Shukla paksha&lt;/a&gt; of the Hindu month of &lt;a href=\"Kartika%20%28month%29\"&gt;Kartika&lt;/a&gt; as \"Jalaram Jayanti\". It falls on seventh day from &lt;a href=\"Diwali\"&gt;Diwali&lt;/a&gt;. On this day, devotees are served meal as &lt;a href=\"prasad\"&gt;prasad&lt;/a&gt;.

The \"Jalaram Jayanti\" celebrations are also held at all Jalaram temples across India &amp; abroad with festivities, where devotees participate to pay their respects and have \"prasad\".\nTemples.\nThe idol of Jalaram Bapa is shown as a smiling man holding &lt;a href=\"danda\"&gt;danda&lt;/a&gt; and wearing often a white &lt;a href=\"paghadi\"&gt;paghadi&lt;/a&gt; and white &lt;a href=\"dhoti\"&gt;dhoti&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"kurta\"&gt;kurta&lt;/a&gt;. The deities of his patron deities Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman are also mostly found along with his idol.
