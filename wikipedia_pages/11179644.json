    "text": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), also known as epigallocatechin-3-gallate, is the &lt;a href=\"ester\"&gt;ester&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"epigallocatechin\"&gt;epigallocatechin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gallic%20acid\"&gt;gallic acid&lt;/a&gt;, and is a type of &lt;a href=\"catechin\"&gt;catechin&lt;/a&gt;.\nEGCG \u2013 the most abundant catechin in &lt;a href=\"tea\"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 is a &lt;a href=\"polyphenol\"&gt;polyphenol&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"basic%20research\"&gt;basic research&lt;/a&gt; for its potential to affect human health and disease. EGCG is used in many &lt;a href=\"dietary%20supplement\"&gt;dietary supplement&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFood sources.\nTea.\nIt is found in high content in the dried leaves of &lt;a href=\"green%20tea\"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt; (7380\u00a0mg per 100 g), &lt;a href=\"white%20tea\"&gt;white tea&lt;/a&gt; (4245\u00a0mg per 100 g), and in smaller quantities, &lt;a href=\"black%20tea\"&gt;black tea&lt;/a&gt; (936\u00a0mg per 100 g). During black tea production, the catechins are mostly converted to &lt;a href=\"theaflavin\"&gt;theaflavin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"thearubigin\"&gt;thearubigin&lt;/a&gt;s via &lt;a href=\"polyphenol%20oxidase\"&gt;polyphenol oxidase&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOther.\nTrace amounts are found in &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt; skin, &lt;a href=\"plum\"&gt;plum&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"onion\"&gt;onion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hazelnut\"&gt;hazelnut&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pecans\"&gt;pecans&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"carob\"&gt;carob&lt;/a&gt; powder (at 109\u00a0mg per 100 g).\nBioavailability.\nWhen taken orally, EGCG has poor absorption even at daily intake equivalent to 8\u201316 cups of green tea, an amount causing &lt;a href=\"adverse%20events\"&gt;adverse effects&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"nausea\"&gt;nausea&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"heartburn\"&gt;heartburn&lt;/a&gt;. After consumption, EGCG blood levels peak within 1.7 hours. The absorbed &lt;a href=\"plasma%20half-life\"&gt;plasma half-life&lt;/a&gt; is ~5 hours, but with majority of unchanged EGCG excreted into &lt;a href=\"urine\"&gt;urine&lt;/a&gt; over 0 to 8 hours. Methylated metabolites appear to have longer half-lives and occur at 8\u201325 times the plasma levels of unmetabolized EGCG.\nResearch.\nWell-studied in &lt;a href=\"basic%20research\"&gt;basic research&lt;/a&gt;, EGCG has various &lt;a href=\"function%20%28biology%29\"&gt;biological effects&lt;/a&gt; in laboratory studies. EGCG is a &lt;a href=\"Receptor%20modulator\"&gt;modulator&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"GABAA%20receptor\"&gt;GABAA receptor&lt;/a&gt;.\nA 2011 analysis by the &lt;a href=\"European%20Food%20Safety%20Authority\"&gt;European Food Safety Authority&lt;/a&gt; found that a &lt;a href=\"causality\"&gt;cause and effect relationship&lt;/a&gt; could not be shown for a link between tea catechins and the maintenance of normal blood LDL-cholesterol concentration. A 2016 review found that high daily doses (107 to 856\u00a0mg/day) taken by human subjects over four to 14 weeks produced a small reduction of &lt;a href=\"low-density%20lipoprotein\"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.\nPotential toxicity.\nA 2018 review showed that excessive intake of EGCG may cause &lt;a href=\"hepatotoxicity\"&gt;liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, the &lt;a href=\"European%20Food%20Safety%20Authority\"&gt;European Food Safety Authority&lt;/a&gt; stated that daily intake of 800\u00a0mg or more could increase risk of liver damage. The degree of toxicity varies by person, suggesting that it is potentiated by genetic predisposition and the diet eaten during the period of ingestion, or other factors.\nRat studies have shown that EGCG concentrations in the liver are about four times greater than in blood plasma. Toxic effects can be seen in the liver without any toxic effects in other organs or tissues. &lt;a href=\"Antioxidant\"&gt;Antioxidant&lt;/a&gt;s may reduce the toxic effects of EGCG.\nTaken as a capsule or tablet 338\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kilogram%23SI%20multiples\"&gt;mg&lt;/a&gt; per day of EGCG is considered safe, whereas 704\u00a0mg per day is safe if consumed as a tea beverage. 100\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Litre%23SI%20prefixes%20applied%20to%20the%20litre\"&gt;mL&lt;/a&gt; of green tea contains about 70.2\u00a0mg of EGCG (about 165\u00a0mg per cup).\nRegulation.\nOver 2008 to 2017, the US &lt;a href=\"Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration\"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; issued several &lt;a href=\"FDA%20warning%20letter\"&gt;warning letters&lt;/a&gt; to manufacturers of dietary supplements containing EGCG for violations of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Food%2C%20Drug%2C%20and%20Cosmetic%20Act\"&gt;Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these letters informed the companies that their promotional materials promoted EGCG-based dietary supplements in the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions that cause them to be classified as drugs under the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20code\"&gt;United States code&lt;/a&gt;, while another focused on inadequate quality assurance procedures and labeling violations. The warnings were issued because the products had not been established as safe and effective for their marketed uses and were promoted as \"&lt;a href=\"New%20drug%20application\"&gt;new drugs&lt;/a&gt;\", without approval as required under the Act."
