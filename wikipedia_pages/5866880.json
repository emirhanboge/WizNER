The band's first short unofficial albums were released online in 2001, spreading its music through words of \"&lt;a href=\"netizen\"&gt;netizen&lt;/a&gt;s,\" who positively received the band's music. They remained underground until the release of their first album \"Instant Pig\" in 2004, selling over 80,000 copies. Since then, their music has been used in shows, commercials, and films.\nClazziquai is known for their songs, \"Be My Love\" and \"She Is\", which were featured on the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20drama\"&gt;Korean drama&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Lovely%20Samsoon\"&gt;My Lovely Samsoon&lt;/a&gt;\", with the former becoming the show's theme song. The band won an award at the MNET KM Music Video Festival for \"Best Soundtrack\", and has also been the most nominated band at the Korean Popular Music Awards II(2\ud68c), winning \"Artist of the Year\" and \"Best Pop\". They have contributed to works by Japanese artists &lt;a href=\"Fantastic%20Plastic%20Machine%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Fantastic Plastic Machine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M-Flo\"&gt;M-Flo&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n2001: Formation.\n&lt;a href=\"DJ%20Clazzi\"&gt;DJ Clazzi&lt;/a&gt;, described as \"a magician at synthesizing different sounds in music into creating one unique [sic] new genre\". graduated from &lt;a href=\"Capilano%20College\"&gt;Capilano College&lt;/a&gt;, and continued his study at Centre for Digital Imaging and Sound (CDIS). After his graduation, he worked as a web designer, uploading his music online during his leisure time. DJ Clazzi's music became popular on Korean social media, with the experimental nature of his music being well received by Korean netizens, which is the reason why Clazziquai was initially labeled a \"project group\".\n&lt;a href=\"Korean%20Canadian\"&gt;Korean-Canadian&lt;/a&gt; siblings &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Chu\"&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; and Christina Chu were initially acquaintances with DJ Clazzi and participated vocally on the first three short and experimental albums released online, named \"gray\", \"red\", and \"retro\".\nChristina Chu left the official line up and &lt;a href=\"Horan%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Horan&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to fill her spot. Chu occasionally contributes her vocals to the band, although she is often an uncredited guest artist.\n2004\u20132006: \"Instant Pig\" and \"Color Your Soul\".\nClazziquai released their first studio album, \"Instant Pig\", in May 2004. The album received critical acclaim, which led to more than five songs from the album being used in six television commercials. The remixed English version of the song, \"Come To Me\", in its remix album \"Zbam\" was released in November 2004, and was later used as a song in a television commercial featuring &lt;a href=\"David%20Beckham\"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fantastic%20Plastic%20Machine%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Fantastic Plastic Machine&lt;/a&gt; praised Clazziquai as a new band to lead the \"&lt;a href=\"Hallyu\"&gt;Hallyu&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2005, Clazziquai's \"Be My Love\" and \"She Is\", were featured in the South Korean hit television drama, \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Lovely%20Samsoon\"&gt;My Lovely Samsoon&lt;/a&gt;\". These two major theme songs also raised the ratings of the series up 50%. Clazziquai had hoped then that people's imagination towards their music would not 'decrease as a result of their unexpected popularity'. In September 2005, Clazziquai released their second album, \"Color Your Soul\" claiming it had a \"raw, funkier feel presenting a combination of electronic music and [an] emphasized acoustic genre\".

The remix version of the original album was released in South Korea later in the year as \"Mucho Beat\".\n2012\u20132018: \"Blessed\", \"Blink\" and \"Travellers\".\nIn December 2012, Clazziquai released the single, \"Can't Go On My Own\", as part of the \"&lt;a href=\"Can%20We%20Get%20Married%3F\"&gt;Can We Get Married?&lt;/a&gt;\" OST.
