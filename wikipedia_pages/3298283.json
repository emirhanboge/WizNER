    "text": "\"Finally\" is the 1991 debut single by American singer and songwriter &lt;a href=\"CeCe%20Peniston\"&gt;CeCe Peniston&lt;/a&gt; from her debut album, \"&lt;a href=\"Finally%20%28CeCe%20Peniston%20album%29\"&gt;Finally&lt;/a&gt;\" (1992). It became Peniston's first (and biggest) hit song, peaking at number five on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;US Billboard Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; in January 1992 and becoming her only US top-ten hit to date. Prior to that, the track was a major success on the US &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Play\"&gt;Dance charts&lt;/a&gt;, where it spent two weeks at number one in late 1991. In addition, a dance remix of the song peaked at number two on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; in March 1992. The remix appeared on many &lt;a href=\"dance%20music\"&gt;dance music&lt;/a&gt; compilations in the early 90s.\nBackground and release.\nPeniston grew up in &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; and began writing pop songs during school. The words of \"Finally\" were purportedly penned during a chemistry class, while thinking about dating in college. In 1989 and 1990 she won the Miss Black Arizona pageant, and took the Miss Galaxy pageant a short time later.\nHer music career began in January 1991, when &lt;a href=\"Felipe%20Delgado%20%28record%20producer%29\"&gt;Felipe \"DJ Wax Dawg\" Delgado&lt;/a&gt;, her friend and a record producer based also in Phoenix, asked Peniston to record back-up vocals for &lt;a href=\"Tonya%20Davis\"&gt;Tonya Davis&lt;/a&gt;, a rapper known as &lt;a href=\"Overweight%20Pooch\"&gt;Overweight Pooch&lt;/a&gt;. Though Overweight Pooch's album flopped on the market, &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Lehman%20%28disc%20jockey%29\"&gt;Manny Lehman&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Deejay\"&gt;DJ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"executive%20producer\"&gt;executive producer&lt;/a&gt;) had noticed the powerful voice of the back-up vocalist, Peniston. He offered Delgado a chance to produce a track for Peniston to cultivate her potential as a solo artist. Delgado called hometown friend and music producer, Rodney K. Jackson, to help co-produce Peniston's single, which would become \"Finally\".\nPeniston was 21 years old when \"Finally\" was released. When asked about the song in a 2012 interview, Peniston said: \nNew versions of \"Finally\" were released in 1997 and 2011.\nComposition.\nThe remix of this song is based on the piano riff from the &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house music&lt;/a&gt; classic \"&lt;a href=\"Someday%20%28CeCe%20Rogers%20song%29\"&gt;Someday&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"CeCe%20Rogers\"&gt;CeCe Rogers&lt;/a&gt; from 1987. The song is performed in the key of &lt;a href=\"B%20minor\"&gt;B minor&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"tempo\"&gt;tempo&lt;/a&gt; of 120 beats per minute, following a chord progression of G \u2013 G/A \u2013 Bm, and Peniston's vocals span from B3 to D5.\nCritical reception.\nBill Lamb from &lt;a href=\"About.com\"&gt;About.com&lt;/a&gt; described \"Finally\" as an \"upbeat, celebratory song about love\". Steven E. Flemming, Jr. from Albumism noted that it \"skillfully melded the insistent grace of all that\u2019s right about dance production values with grand vocals.\" &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; editor Craig Lytle wrote in his review that the song and its follow-up \"&lt;a href=\"We%20Got%20a%20Love%20Thang\"&gt;We Got a Love Thang&lt;/a&gt;\" \"employ that rapid dancehall groove better known as &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house music&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Flick\"&gt;Larry Flick&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" called it \"a delicious peak-hour houser that is in a vein similar to &lt;a href=\"Alison%20Limerick\"&gt;Alison Limerick&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Where%20Love%20Lives\"&gt;Where Love Lives&lt;/a&gt;\". Peniston wraps her lovely alto around a hook that seeps into the brain and body and never lets go.\" He added that Peniston \"proves her potential as a future diva on this brain-embedding, spine-stirring house anthem.\" &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Stopera\"&gt;Matt Stopera&lt;/a&gt; and Brian Galindo from \"&lt;a href=\"BuzzFeed\"&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/a&gt;\" noted, \"When it comes to \u201890s dance songs you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find another song that so perfectly incorporates other music genres that made the decade so great \u2014 i.e., &lt;a href=\"R%26amp%3BB\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 which is what makes \u201cFinally\u201d the quintessential \u201890s dance song. And honestly, it\u2019s a feel-good hit! Just try being in a bad mood after listening to it!\" A writer from \"&lt;a href=\"Complex%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Complex&lt;/a&gt;\" said that \"this was the sound of the early 1990s, when everything was turning colorful and bright.\" Amy Linden from \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\" commented, \"The slammin\u2019 house/pop single of the moment? It's CeCe Peniston's \u201dFinally,\u201d and its sheer joy and verve.\" She added further, \"Grooving in the fabulousness of her newfound Mr. Right, and sorta amazed that it all happened, she wails deliciously, making you believe that true love will conquer all and that someday your prince (or princess) will come.\"\nDave Sholin from the \"&lt;a href=\"Gavin%20Report\"&gt;Gavin Report&lt;/a&gt;\" described it as a \"bright and infectious debut release\" and also commented, \"I had a preview of this song back in July and have been in love with it ever since!\" Pan-European magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20%26amp%3B%20Media\"&gt;Music &amp; Media&lt;/a&gt;\" stated that \"this newcomer gives further evidence that dance is still developing into a more song-oriented direction. The violins give the tune the ambiance of &lt;a href=\"Back%20Stabbers%20%28song%29\"&gt;Backstabbers&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"The%20O%27Jays\"&gt;O'Jays&lt;/a&gt;.\" Andy Beevers from \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20Week\"&gt;Music Week&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that the song is a \"extremely classy and catchy garage-styled debut\". &lt;a href=\"James%20Hamilton%20%28DJ%20and%20journalist%29\"&gt;James Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; from the magazine's \"RM\" Dance Update labeled the track as \"cheerful wailing\" and a \"ex-Miss America's catchy &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Waters\"&gt;Crystal Waters&lt;/a&gt;-type US pop smash\". A reviewer from \"&lt;a href=\"People%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;People Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" said that it's \"overflowing with verve and loaded up with joyous girlie glee\", noting the \"ecstatic, beat-heavy power\" of the track. Pop Rescue called it \"a great track, with that fantastic hand-clap, bassline and piano opening\", adding that Peniston's vocals are \"sublime\". Adam Higginbotham from \"&lt;a href=\"Select%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Select&lt;/a&gt;\" stated that \"Finally\" \"is a superb slice of feel-good pop music. From its bassline \u2014 purloined from Ce Ce (no relation) Rogers' classic garage tune '&lt;a href=\"Someday%20%28CeCe%20Rogers%20song%29\"&gt;Someday&lt;/a&gt;' \u2014 to the inanely cheery lyrics.\" Tom Doyle from \"&lt;a href=\"Smash%20Hits\"&gt;Smash Hits&lt;/a&gt;\" viewed it as a \"rousing house song\". Steve Pick from \"&lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Post-Dispatch\"&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that \"this is a catchy disco number, building energy through repetition of the simple hookline and a solid bass/drum throb. Get on the dance floor to this one, and you'll move.\"\nChart performance.\nThe song was released in the fall of 1991, where it became an instant dance anthem, peaking in October at the top of the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Songs\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot Dance Music/Club Play&lt;/a&gt; in the United States for two weeks, while achieving respectable chart success overseas the following year. The song was re-released in the United Kingdom, where it reached a new peak of number two in its second week at the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;, on March 22, 1992. It was held off reaching the top spot by &lt;a href=\"Shakespears%20Sister\"&gt;Shakespears Sister&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Stay%20%28Shakespears%20Sister%20song%29\"&gt;Stay&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Finally\" also charted at number-one in Zimbabwe and on the \"&lt;a href=\"RPM%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;RPM&lt;/a&gt;\" Dance/Urban chart in Canada, and number eight in Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, the song reached number three in Belgium and number five in the Netherlands and Ireland. Following the single's success, Peniston completed her first album, &lt;a href=\"Finally%20%28CeCe%20Peniston%20album%29\"&gt;\"Finally\"&lt;/a&gt;, in two months.
