    "text": "\"It's Alright Now\" is a &lt;a href=\"single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; by UK band &lt;a href=\"The%20Beloved%20%28band%29\"&gt;The Beloved&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritical reception.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Music%20%26amp%3B%20Media\"&gt;Music &amp; Media&lt;/a&gt;\" commented, \"Soft-spoken vocals and basic beats and basslines produce a song that is very close to &lt;a href=\"New%20Order%20%28band%29\"&gt;New Order&lt;/a&gt;-type of moody &lt;a href=\"dance%20pop\"&gt;dance pop&lt;/a&gt;.\" Nick Robinson from \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20Week\"&gt;Music Week&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that this track finds the duo \"retouching a track that doesn't sound that dissimilar to their previous singles and recent works by fellow Mancunians &lt;a href=\"Cabaret%20Voltaire%20%28band%29\"&gt;Cabaret Voltaire&lt;/a&gt;. Undemanding, mellow &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; grooves that sort of drift in and out with a degree of style. A hit but not a big one.\"\nMusic video.\nThe music video for this song features Jon Marsh and Steve Waddington travelling on the &lt;a href=\"London%20Underground\"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt;, intercut with footage of Jon Marsh riding in a hot-air balloon. The song was also promoted live on the UK music program Dance Energy, which included a then-unknown Geri Halliwell dancing amongst the studio audience."
