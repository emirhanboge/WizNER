He played &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20State%20Cyclones%20football\"&gt;Iowa State&lt;/a&gt;. He was &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Draft\"&gt;drafted&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20Patriots\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt; in the third round of the &lt;a href=\"2005%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2005 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; and played for them from 2005\u20132008. He was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Eagles\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; in April 2009 and played for them from 2009\u20132010 before a neck injury ended his career. Hobbs previously shared the NFL record for the longest &lt;a href=\"kickoff%20return\"&gt;kickoff return&lt;/a&gt; (108 yards) with &lt;a href=\"Randall%20Cobb%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Randall Cobb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jacoby%20Jones\"&gt;Jacoby Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a feat he accomplished on September 9, 2007 in a game against the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Jets\"&gt;New York Jets&lt;/a&gt;. This record was eclipsed by a 109-yard kickoff return touchdown by &lt;a href=\"Cordarrelle%20Patterson\"&gt;Cordarrelle Patterson&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Vikings\"&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/a&gt; against Green Bay on October 27, 2013.\nEarly years.\nHobbs attended &lt;a href=\"DeSoto%20High%20School%20%28DeSoto%2C%20Texas%29\"&gt;DeSoto High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"DeSoto%2C%20Texas\"&gt;DeSoto, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a standout in &lt;a href=\"High%20school%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Track%20and%20field\"&gt;track&lt;/a&gt;. In track, he participated on the &lt;a href=\"4%20x%20100%20metres%20relay\"&gt;4x100&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"4%20x%20400%20metres%20relay\"&gt;4x400 relay&lt;/a&gt; teams and the &lt;a href=\"long%20jump\"&gt;long jump&lt;/a&gt;. In football, he starred at cornerback as well as &lt;a href=\"running%20back\"&gt;running back&lt;/a&gt;; he ran for 1,701 yards on 233 carries with 29 &lt;a href=\"touchdowns\"&gt;touchdowns&lt;/a&gt; and caught 18 passes for 265 yards and three touchdowns.\nCollege career.\nHobbs was just seven credits short of graduating when he entered the NFL, and in 2009 (four years after leaving college) he completed his degree and graduated from &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20State%20University\"&gt;Iowa State University&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt; in art and design. A three-year &lt;a href=\"Starting%20lineup\"&gt;starter&lt;/a&gt; at right cornerback, he compiled 209 &lt;a href=\"Tackle%20%28football%20move%29\"&gt;tackles&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Quarterback%20sack\"&gt;sacks&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href=\"fumble\"&gt;fumble&lt;/a&gt; recoveries, two forced fumbles, and 29 &lt;a href=\"Pass%20defensed\"&gt;pass deflections&lt;/a&gt; during his tenure. He also found success as a &lt;a href=\"kick%20returner\"&gt;kick returner&lt;/a&gt;, gaining 490 yards on 24 career kick returns. He earned All-&lt;a href=\"Big%2012%20Conference\"&gt;Big 12 Conference&lt;/a&gt; first-team honors as a senior. Hobbs also received the Academic Athlete of the Year Award and was a finalist for Christian Athlete of the Year at Iowa State.\nProfessional career.\nNew England Patriots.\n2005\u201306 seasons.\nDespite limited playing time early in the season, Hobbs made a number of contributions to the Patriots in his rookie season. A string of injuries in the Patriots secondary resulted in Hobbs starting at cornerback the final eight games of the season. Hobbs caught three &lt;a href=\"interception\"&gt;interception&lt;/a&gt;s and earned 371 yards on 15 kickoff returns (including a crucial 35-yard return in the Patriots' game-winning drive against the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;).\nAlthough Hobbs initially won the starting cornerback job in &lt;a href=\"2006%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; opposite &lt;a href=\"Asante%20Samuel\"&gt;Asante Samuel&lt;/a&gt;, Hobbs struggled somewhat during his second year in the NFL, in part because of a broken wrist suffered early in the season. Hobbs, who wore a black cast for much of the season, missed a couple of games and lost his job as starter during the second half of the season. Nevertheless, he had two interceptions for the season (one in &lt;a href=\"garbage%20time\"&gt;garbage time&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Vikings\"&gt;Vikings&lt;/a&gt;, which he returned 70 yards). In addition, filling in for an injured &lt;a href=\"Laurence%20Maroney\"&gt;Laurence Maroney&lt;/a&gt; at kick returner, he returned a kick against the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Dolphins\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; for 51 yards, and returned a kick against the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Texans\"&gt;Houston Texans&lt;/a&gt; for 93 yards and a touchdown, the first of his career, and the first kickoff return for a touchdown by a Patriot since &lt;a href=\"Bethel%20Johnson\"&gt;Bethel Johnson&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. For the season, he recorded 47 total tackles, 2 interceptions, and 4 passes defensed. He also recorded 14 total tackles in the Patriots' three playoff games.\nHobbs performed well in the 2006 playoffs, breaking up several potential touchdown passes, including two in the Divisional round against the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Chargers\"&gt;San Diego Chargers&lt;/a&gt;, and one in the AFC Championship Game against the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Colts\"&gt;Indianapolis Colts&lt;/a&gt;. That play against the Colts was flagged as &lt;a href=\"pass%20interference\"&gt;pass interference&lt;/a&gt;, a call that proved controversial. Greg Aiello, NFL vice president of communications, stated it was correctly flagged as pass interference. However, there were also reports that the NFL admitted the call was incorrect, and apologized to Hobbs. Hobbs also returned a kickoff 80 yards in the AFC Championship Game.\n2007\u201308 seasons.\nOn September 9, 2007, Hobbs broke the record for the longest kickoff return in NFL history when he ran a &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Nugent\"&gt;Mike Nugent&lt;/a&gt; kickoff back 108 yards for a touchdown against the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Jets\"&gt;New York Jets&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Giants%20Stadium\"&gt;Giants Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, it also tied the record for the longest play in NFL history.\nIn Week 3, against the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Bills\"&gt;Bills&lt;/a&gt;, Hobbs recorded his first NFL &lt;a href=\"Quarterback%20sack\"&gt;sack&lt;/a&gt; when he brought down &lt;a href=\"J.%20P.%20Losman\"&gt;J. P. Losman&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Blitz%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;blitz&lt;/a&gt;; he also forced a fumble, which was recovered by Patriots defensive end &lt;a href=\"Jarvis%20Green\"&gt;Jarvis Green&lt;/a&gt;. In Week 10, in the rematch at Buffalo, Hobbs recovered a fumble by Bills running back &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Wright\"&gt;Dwayne Wright&lt;/a&gt; (forced by Patriots &lt;a href=\"Safety%20%28American%20football%20position%29\"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"James%20Sanders%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;James Sanders&lt;/a&gt;), and returned it for his second return touchdown of the season.\nIn Week 17 against the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;, Hobbs intercepted a pass by &lt;a href=\"2007%20New%20York%20Giants%20season\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; quarterback &lt;a href=\"Eli%20Manning\"&gt;Eli Manning&lt;/a&gt; in the fourth quarter, which ultimately led to the Patriots' go-ahead touchdown in the game that completed New England's perfect 16-0 season. He also intercepted a pass by &lt;a href=\"2007%20San%20Diego%20Chargers%20season\"&gt;Chargers&lt;/a&gt; quarterback &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Rivers\"&gt;Philip Rivers&lt;/a&gt; in the AFC Championship Game.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XLII\"&gt;Super Bowl XLII&lt;/a&gt;, Hobbs intercepted Manning again. This time on a pass that deflected off the hands of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; rookie wide receiver, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Smith%20%28wide%20receiver%2C%20born%201985%29\"&gt;Steve Smith&lt;/a&gt;. However, later in the game, with only 35 seconds left, wide receiver &lt;a href=\"Plaxico%20Burress\"&gt;Plaxico Burress&lt;/a&gt; beat Hobbs to the left corner of the end zone for what ended up being a game-winning 13-yard touchdown pass.\nHobbs played in the Super Bowl with a torn &lt;a href=\"Glenoid%20labrum\"&gt;labrum&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"shoulder\"&gt;shoulder&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the chronic &lt;a href=\"groin\"&gt;groin&lt;/a&gt; pain previously reported. Hobbs had &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20James%20Andrews\"&gt;Dr. James Andrews&lt;/a&gt; repair the shoulder, which was originally injured in Week 9, on February 12.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2008%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Hobbs intercepted three passes and set the Patriots single game record for yards on kick returns, with 237 yards in a loss to Miami in Week 3. He also returned his third career touchdown against the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Raiders\"&gt;Oakland Raiders&lt;/a&gt; in Week 15 which once again earned him Special Teams Player of the Week honors. He ended the season leading the AFC, and second in the NFL, in kick return average.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nOn the second day of the &lt;a href=\"2009%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2009 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;, the Patriots traded Hobbs to the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Eagles\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; for two fifth-round selections, which the Patriots traded for fourth- and sixth-round selections; the Patriots ultimately drafted guard &lt;a href=\"Rich%20Ohrnberger\"&gt;Rich Ohrnberger&lt;/a&gt; and long snapper &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Ingram\"&gt;Jake Ingram&lt;/a&gt; with the picks they received for Hobbs. Hobbs won the starting kick returner job over rookie &lt;a href=\"wide%20receiver\"&gt;wide receiver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Maclin\"&gt;Jeremy Maclin&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2009%20NFL%20season\"&gt;2009 season&lt;/a&gt;. On November 11, Hobbs was placed on &lt;a href=\"injured%20reserve\"&gt;injured reserve&lt;/a&gt; with a neck injury.\nHobbs was re-signed to a one-year contract on March 30, 2010. On April 2, the Eagles traded starting cornerback &lt;a href=\"Sheldon%20Brown%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Sheldon Brown&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Browns\"&gt;Cleveland Browns&lt;/a&gt;, with Hobbs now favored to start alongside former Patriots teammate &lt;a href=\"Asante%20Samuel\"&gt;Asante Samuel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early third quarter of the Eagles' November 21, 2010 game against the Giants, Hobbs took a blow to the head from the Giants' &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Tollefson\"&gt;Dave Tollefson&lt;/a&gt; while returning a kick, and had to be carted off the field. He suffered a &lt;a href=\"Intervertebral%20disc\"&gt;disc&lt;/a&gt; injury and was placed on injured reserve. He announced his retirement on July 28, 2011."
