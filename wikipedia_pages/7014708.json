    "text": "Joseph Smith (25 June 1889 \u2013 11 August 1971) was an English professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and manager. He is eleventh in the list of England's top-flight goal scorers with 243 league goals to his name. He was manager of &lt;a href=\"Blackpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt; for 23 years and guided them to victory in the &lt;a href=\"1953%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1953 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, the only time they have won the competition since their 1887 inception.\nA &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;, he began his career at &lt;a href=\"Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.\"&gt;Crewe Alexandra&lt;/a&gt;, but did not play a first team game for the club. He instead made his name at &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;, where with 277 league and cup goals between 1908 and 1927, he is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.%20records%20and%20statistics\"&gt;club's second highest goalscorer&lt;/a&gt;, only eight behind &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Lofthouse\"&gt;Nat Lofthouse&lt;/a&gt;. He won the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; title with Bolton &lt;a href=\"1908%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1908\u201309&lt;/a&gt;, and played in FA Cup final victories in &lt;a href=\"1923%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1923&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1926%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1926&lt;/a&gt;. He later hit 61 goals in 70 league games for &lt;a href=\"Stockport%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Stockport County&lt;/a&gt;, before being appointed player-manager at &lt;a href=\"Darwen%20F.C.\"&gt;Darwen&lt;/a&gt; in 1929. Two years later he was appointed manager of &lt;a href=\"Reading%20F.C.\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt;, and narrowly missed out on promotion during his four seasons in charge. He became Blackpool manager in August 1935, and remained in this position until April 1958. He led the \"Seasiders\" to one victory in three FA Cup final appearances (&lt;a href=\"1948%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1951%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1951&lt;/a&gt;, and 1953), and also led the club to runners-up spot in the Second Division in 1936\u201337, second place in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; in 1955\u201356, and runners-up in the &lt;a href=\"1953%20FA%20Charity%20Shield\"&gt;1953 FA Charity Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nBolton Wanderers.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Dudley\"&gt;Dudley&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20conurbation\"&gt;West Midlands&lt;/a&gt;, Smith was the younger brother of footballer &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Smith%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Philip Smith&lt;/a&gt;, who was killed during the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;. After leaving &lt;a href=\"Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.\"&gt;Crewe Alexandra&lt;/a&gt;, Smith spent almost his entire playing career with &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;, for whom he signed in 1908, either as an inside or centre-forward. Wanderers won the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; title in &lt;a href=\"1908%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League\"&gt;1908\u201309&lt;/a&gt;, but were immediately relegated out of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1909%E2%80%9310%20Football%20League\"&gt;1909\u201310&lt;/a&gt;. They regained their top-flight status after securing a second-place finish in the Second Division in &lt;a href=\"1910%E2%80%9311%20Football%20League\"&gt;1910\u201311&lt;/a&gt;. Smith then became the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.%20seasons\"&gt;club's top-scorer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1911%E2%80%9312%20Football%20League\"&gt;1911\u201312&lt;/a&gt; with 24 goals, as Bolton posted a fourth-place finish, six points behind champions &lt;a href=\"Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackburn Rovers&lt;/a&gt;. He scored 22 goals in &lt;a href=\"1912%E2%80%9313%20Football%20League\"&gt;1912\u201313&lt;/a&gt;, as Bolton dropped to eighth position. &lt;a href=\"George%20Lillycrop\"&gt;George Lillycrop&lt;/a&gt; then became the club's leading scorer in &lt;a href=\"1913%E2%80%9314%20Football%20League\"&gt;1913\u201314&lt;/a&gt;, before Smith finished as the club's top-scorer for the third time in four seasons with 36 goals in &lt;a href=\"1914%E2%80%9315%20Football%20League\"&gt;1914\u201315&lt;/a&gt;. During the First World War he guested for &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the war, Bolton finished sixth in &lt;a href=\"1919%E2%80%9320%20Football%20League\"&gt;1919\u201320&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of \"Trotters\" teammate &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Vizard\"&gt;Ted Vizard&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"1920%E2%80%9321%20Football%20League\"&gt;1920\u201321&lt;/a&gt; season Smith scored a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.%20records%20and%20statistics\"&gt;club record&lt;/a&gt; 38 goals, which put him top of the First Division goalscoring chart for that season; the club recorded a third-place finish. However Bolton dropped to sixth position again in &lt;a href=\"1921%E2%80%9322%20Football%20League\"&gt;1921\u201322&lt;/a&gt;. Smith recorded 19 goals in &lt;a href=\"1922%E2%80%9323%20Football%20League\"&gt;1922\u201323&lt;/a&gt; to become the club's top-scorer for the fifth time. His goals helped Bolton to reach the &lt;a href=\"1923%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1923 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the first &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; final to be held at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt;. Smith captained Bolton to a 2\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"David%20Jack%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;David Jack&lt;/a&gt; then took the mantle as the club's main source of goals in &lt;a href=\"1923%E2%80%9324%20Football%20League\"&gt;1923\u201324&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1924%E2%80%9325%20Football%20League\"&gt;1924\u201325&lt;/a&gt;, as Bolton posted two top four finishes in succession. Smith scored 21 goals in &lt;a href=\"1925%E2%80%9326%20Football%20League\"&gt;1925\u201326&lt;/a&gt; to finish as the club's top-scorer for the sixth and final time. He also captained the club to another FA Cup final victory, as a goal from namesake &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201895%29\"&gt;Jack Smith&lt;/a&gt; was enough to beat &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1926%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1\u20130&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"1926%E2%80%9327%20Football%20League\"&gt;1926\u201327&lt;/a&gt; season was then his last at the club, as he led Bolton to fourth in the league, eight points behind leaders &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt;. In his nineteen years with Bolton, Smith scored 277 goals in 492 games (his league record being 254 goals in 449 appearances).\nLater career.\nUpon leaving Wanderers in 1927, Smith signed for &lt;a href=\"Stockport%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Stockport County&lt;/a&gt; and went on to score 61 goals in 70 league games at &lt;a href=\"Edgeley%20Park\"&gt;Edgeley Park&lt;/a&gt;. With 38 &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North\"&gt;Third Division North&lt;/a&gt; goals in &lt;a href=\"1927%E2%80%9328%20Football%20League\"&gt;1927\u201328&lt;/a&gt;, he was the division's top-scorer that season, though the \"Hatters\" could only manage a third-place finish. County then finished second in &lt;a href=\"1928%E2%80%9329%20Football%20League\"&gt;1928\u201329&lt;/a&gt;, just one point behind champions &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt;. Smith went on to play for &lt;a href=\"Darwen%20F.C.\"&gt;Darwen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Central%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester Central&lt;/a&gt;, before finishing his playing career with &lt;a href=\"Hyde%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Hyde United&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nThe first of Smith's five England caps came on 15 February 1913, in a 2\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Belfast\"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Park\"&gt;Windsor Park&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Home%20Championship\"&gt;Home Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He then scored the opening goal of a 2\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ninian%20Park\"&gt;Ninian Park&lt;/a&gt; on 16 March 1914. He then played England's next three games either side of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;: a 3\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hampden%20Park\"&gt;Hampden Park&lt;/a&gt; (14 April 1914), a 1\u20131 draw with Ireland at Windsor Park (25 October 1919), and a 2\u20131 defeat to Wales at &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20Stadium\"&gt;Highbury&lt;/a&gt; (15 March 1920).\nManagerial career.\nDarwen.\nIn 1929, Smith became &lt;a href=\"player-manager\"&gt;player-manager&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Darwen%20F.C.\"&gt;Darwen&lt;/a&gt;. As a player, he scored 42 goals in 51 games. As manager, he guided them to wins in the Lancashire Combination Championship (twice), the Combination Cup (twice), the Lancashire Junior Cup, and the Lancashire Challenge Trophy.\nReading.\nUpon hanging up his playing boots in 1931, Smith became manager of &lt;a href=\"Reading%20F.C.\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt;. In each of his four seasons at &lt;a href=\"Elm%20Park%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;Elm Park&lt;/a&gt;, he took the club to within a few places of promotion out of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South\"&gt;Third Division South&lt;/a&gt;. He led the \"Biscuitmen\" as they were then known to a second-place finish in &lt;a href=\"1931%E2%80%9332%20Football%20League\"&gt;1931\u201332&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 two points behind champions &lt;a href=\"Fulham%20F.C.\"&gt;Fulham&lt;/a&gt;, a fourth-place finish in &lt;a href=\"1932%E2%80%9333%20Football%20League\"&gt;1932\u201333&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 11 points behind leaders &lt;a href=\"Brentford%20F.C.\"&gt;Brentford&lt;/a&gt;, third in &lt;a href=\"1933%E2%80%9334%20Football%20League\"&gt;1933\u201334&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 seven points short of &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Norwich City&lt;/a&gt;, and second in &lt;a href=\"1934%E2%80%9335%20Football%20League\"&gt;1934\u201335&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 eight points behind promoted &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Charlton Athletic&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis success was due mostly to his phenomenal home record. In 84 matches at Elm Park he won 66 and lost only 3, scoring an average of three goals per game, and steering the club on a 55-game unbeaten home run that lasted from April 1933 until after he left in 1935.\nBlackpool.\nIn August 1935, Smith was approached to become the new manager of &lt;a href=\"Blackpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt;, in place of the departed &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20MacFarlane\"&gt;Sandy MacFarlane&lt;/a&gt;, an offer he immediately accepted; a love of the seaside apparently being one of the main deciding factors. After a tenth-place finish in &lt;a href=\"1935%E2%80%9336%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1935\u201336&lt;/a&gt;, he led the club to promotion in &lt;a href=\"1936%E2%80%9337%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1936\u201337&lt;/a&gt; with a second-place finish in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt;. He then secured the club's &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; status with mid-table finishes in &lt;a href=\"1937%E2%80%9338%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1937\u201338&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1938%E2%80%9339%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1938\u201339&lt;/a&gt;. On 10 March 1939, Smith and club director Albert Hindley made the football headlines when they completed the \u00a310,000 record signing of &lt;a href=\"Jock%20Dodds\"&gt;Jock Dodds&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt;. However &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; ensured that Smith's big signing barely featured in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt;, though he went on to score well over 200 goals at &lt;a href=\"Bloomfield%20Road\"&gt;Bloomfield Road&lt;/a&gt; during the war.\nAfter the war, Smith built a formidable \"M\" forward line of &lt;a href=\"Stan%20Mortensen\"&gt;Stan Mortensen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Matthews\"&gt;Stanley Matthews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Mudie\"&gt;Jackie Mudie&lt;/a&gt;. Mortensen and Mudie began their professional careers at the club, whilst Smith signed Matthews from &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Stoke City&lt;/a&gt; for an \u00a311,500 fee in May 1947. Other key signings Smith made during his time at the club include: defender &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Blair\"&gt;Danny Blair&lt;/a&gt; (joined from &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt; in 1936), &lt;a href=\"George%20Farrow\"&gt;George Farrow&lt;/a&gt; (defender signed from &lt;a href=\"Bournemouth%20%26amp%3B%20Boscombe%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a31,250 in 1936), &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; winger &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Munro%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201912%29\"&gt;Alex Munro&lt;/a&gt; (signed from &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hearts&lt;/a&gt; in March 1937 for \u00a33,500), inside-forward &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Buchan\"&gt;Willie Buchan&lt;/a&gt; (signed from &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a310,000), defender &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Hayward\"&gt;Eric Hayward&lt;/a&gt; (free signing from &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt; in May 1937), &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Shimwell\"&gt;Eddie Shimwell&lt;/a&gt; (signed from &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a37,000 in December 1946), full-back &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Wright%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Jackie Wright&lt;/a&gt; (signed from &lt;a href=\"Mossley%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Mossley&lt;/a&gt;), goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"George%20Farm\"&gt;George Farm&lt;/a&gt; (joined on a free transfer from &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt;), midfielder &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201926%29\"&gt;Allan Brown&lt;/a&gt; (signed from &lt;a href=\"East%20Fife%20F.C.\"&gt;East Fife&lt;/a&gt; in December 1950), forward &lt;a href=\"Ernie%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201925%29\"&gt;Ernie Taylor&lt;/a&gt; (signed from &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a325,000 in October 1951), defender &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Kelly%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201931%29\"&gt;Jimmy Kelly&lt;/a&gt; (signed from &lt;a href=\"Watford%20F.C.\"&gt;Watford&lt;/a&gt; in October 1954 for \u00a315,000), and striker &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Charnley\"&gt;Ray Charnley&lt;/a&gt; (signed from &lt;a href=\"Morecambe%20F.C.\"&gt;Morecambe&lt;/a&gt; for a \u00a3750 fee in May 1957). A number of significant players also began their professional careers under Smith, including: &lt;a href=\"Barrie%20Martin\"&gt;Barrie Martin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Suart\"&gt;Ron Suart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ewan%20Fenton\"&gt;Ewan Fenton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Garrett%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Tommy Garrett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Perry%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Bill Perry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Durie\"&gt;Dave Durie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Gratrix\"&gt;Roy Gratrix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Peterson%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Brian Peterson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hughie%20Kelly\"&gt;Hughie Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Armfield\"&gt;Jimmy Armfield&lt;/a&gt;. Though he was at Bloomfield Road before Smith, after the war, defender &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Johnston%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201919%29\"&gt;Harry Johnston&lt;/a&gt; went on to win caps for England whilst at Blackpool.\nBlackpool finished fifth in the league in &lt;a href=\"1946%E2%80%9347%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1946\u201347&lt;/a&gt;, just seven points behind champions &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;. The next season, &lt;a href=\"1947%E2%80%9348%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1947\u201348&lt;/a&gt;, they reached the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; final at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in a &lt;a href=\"1948%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;4\u20132 defeat&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Seasiders\" dropped to 16th place in &lt;a href=\"1948%E2%80%9349%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1948\u201349&lt;/a&gt;, but rose to seventh in &lt;a href=\"1949%E2%80%9350%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1949\u201350&lt;/a&gt;, just four points behind champions &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%20F.C.\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;. Though they finished in third place in &lt;a href=\"1950%E2%80%9351%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1950\u201351&lt;/a&gt;, they ended the campaign ten points behind champions &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt;. Smith led the club to another FA Cup final in &lt;a href=\"1951%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1951&lt;/a&gt;, where they were beaten 2\u20130 by Newcastle United after a brace from &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Milburn\"&gt;Jackie Milburn&lt;/a&gt;. Blackpool could only finished ninth and seventh in &lt;a href=\"1951%E2%80%9352%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1951\u201352&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1952%E2%80%9353%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1952\u201353&lt;/a&gt;, but reached another FA Cup final in &lt;a href=\"1953%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1953&lt;/a&gt;. Known as the \"Matthews Final\", &lt;a href=\"Stan%20Mortensen\"&gt;Stan Mortensen&lt;/a&gt; scored a hat-trick against &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; to secure Blackpool a 4\u20133 victory and their first ever FA Cup title. The club finished sixth in the league in &lt;a href=\"1953%E2%80%9354%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1953\u201354&lt;/a&gt; and then dropped down to 19th place in &lt;a href=\"1954%E2%80%9355%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1954\u201355&lt;/a&gt;. Smith then led the club to a record high league finish of second in &lt;a href=\"1955%E2%80%9356%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1955\u201356&lt;/a&gt;, though they ended up some 11 points short of champions Manchester United. They finished fourth in &lt;a href=\"1956%E2%80%9357%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1956\u201357&lt;/a&gt; and seventh in &lt;a href=\"1957%E2%80%9358%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1957\u201358&lt;/a&gt;. After 714 Football League games in charge of Blackpool, Smith resigned in 1958, at the age of 68, due to poor health. The Blackpool board rewarded his services by giving him a hefty \"&lt;a href=\"golden%20handshake\"&gt;golden handshake&lt;/a&gt;\" and bought him a house in the town.\nStatistics.\nPlaying statistics.\nSource:\nManagerial statistics.\nSource:\nHonours.\nAs a player.\nBolton Wanderers\nStockport County\nAs a manager.\nBlackpool"
