    "text": "MoltenVK is a &lt;a href=\"Library%20%28computing%29\"&gt;software library&lt;/a&gt; which allows &lt;a href=\"Vulkan%20API\"&gt;Vulkan&lt;/a&gt; applications to run on top of &lt;a href=\"Metal%20%28API%29\"&gt;Metal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Inc.\"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"macOS\"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"tvOS\"&gt;tvOS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"operating%20system\"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;s. It is the first &lt;a href=\"software%20component\"&gt;software component&lt;/a&gt; to be released for the Vulkan Portability Initiative, a project to have a subset of Vulkan run on platforms lacking &lt;a href=\"Native%20%28computing%29\"&gt;native&lt;/a&gt; Vulkan drivers.\nThere are some limitations compared with a native Vulkan implementation.\nHistory.\nMoltenVK was first released as a &lt;a href=\"Proprietary%20software\"&gt;proprietary&lt;/a&gt; and commercially licensed product by The Brenwill Workshop on July 27, 2016.\nOn July 31, 2017, &lt;a href=\"Khronos%20Group\"&gt;Khronos&lt;/a&gt; announced the formation of the Vulkan Portability Technical Subgroup.\nOpen source.\nOn February 26, 2018, Khronos announced that Vulkan became available on macOS and iOS products through the MoltenVK library. &lt;a href=\"Valve%20Corporation\"&gt;Valve&lt;/a&gt; announced that \"&lt;a href=\"Dota%202\"&gt;Dota 2&lt;/a&gt;\" will run on macOS using the Vulkan API with the aid of MoltenVK, and that they had made an arrangement with developer The Brenwill Workshop Ltd to release MoltenVK as &lt;a href=\"open-source%20software\"&gt;open-source software&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Apache%20License\"&gt;Apache License&lt;/a&gt; version 2.0.\nOn May 30, 2018, &lt;a href=\"Qt%20%28software%29\"&gt;Qt&lt;/a&gt; was updated with Vulkan for Qt on macOS using MoltenVK. On May 31, 2018, optional Vulkan support for &lt;a href=\"Dota%202\"&gt;Dota 2&lt;/a&gt; on macOS was released. Benchmarks for the game were available the following day, showing better performance using Vulkan and MoltenVK compared to OpenGL. On July 20, 2018, &lt;a href=\"Wine%20%28software%29\"&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; was updated with Vulkan support on macOS using MoltenVK. On 29 July 2018, the first app using MoltenVK was accepted onto the &lt;a href=\"App%20Store%20%28iOS%29\"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, after initially being rejected. On 6 August 2018, &lt;a href=\"Google\"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; open-sourced Filament, a crossplatform &lt;a href=\"Real-time%20computer%20graphics\"&gt;real-time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"physically%20based%20rendering\"&gt;physically based rendering&lt;/a&gt; engine with MoltenVK for macOS/iOS. On November 28, 2018, &lt;a href=\"Valve%20Corporation\"&gt;Valve&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt;, their first Vulkan-only game on macOS using MoltenVK.\nVersion 1.0.\nOn 29 January 2019, MoltenVK 1.0.32 was released with early prototype of Vulkan Portability Extensions. &lt;a href=\"RPCS3\"&gt;RPCS3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dolphin%20%28emulator%29\"&gt;Dolphin&lt;/a&gt; emulators were updated with Vulkan support on macOS using MoltenVK. On 13 April 2019, MoltenVK 1.0.34 was released with support for &lt;a href=\"Tessellation%20%28computer%20graphics%29\"&gt;tessellation&lt;/a&gt;. On July 30, 2019, MoltenVK 1.0.36 was released targeting Metal 3.0. On July 31, 2020, MoltenVK 1.0.44 was released, adding support for the &lt;a href=\"tvOS\"&gt;tvOS&lt;/a&gt; platform. On January 23, 2020, MoltenVK was updated to support for some of the new features of &lt;a href=\"Vulkan_%28API%29%23Vulkan_1.2\"&gt;Vulkan 1.2&lt;/a&gt;, as of Vulkan SDK 1.2.121. \nVersion 1.1.\nOn October 1, 2020, MoltenVK 1.1.0 was released, adding full support for &lt;a href=\"Vulkan_%28API%29%23Vulkan_1.1\"&gt;Vulkan 1.1&lt;/a&gt;, as of Vulkan SDK 1.2.154.\nOn 9 December, version 1.1.1 was released, providing support for Vulkan on &lt;a href=\"Apple%20M1\"&gt;Apple silicon&lt;/a&gt; GPUs and support for the &lt;a href=\"IOS_SDK%23Mac_Catalyst\"&gt;Mac Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; platform for porting iOS/iPadOS apps to macOS.
