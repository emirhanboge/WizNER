    "text": "Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share &lt;a href=\"knowledge\"&gt;knowledge&lt;/a&gt; in their daily activities and the way in which these processes support work activities . It is a response to the idea that &lt;a href=\"knowledge%20worker\"&gt;knowledge worker&lt;/a&gt;s need to be responsible for their own growth and learning . It is a bottom-up approach to &lt;a href=\"knowledge%20management\"&gt;knowledge management&lt;/a&gt; (KM) .\nHistory and background.\nAlthough as early as 1998 Davenport wrote on the importance to worker productivity of understanding individual knowledge processes (cited in ), the term \"personal knowledge management\" appears to be relatively new. Its origin can be traced in a working paper by .\nPKM integrates &lt;a href=\"personal%20information%20management\"&gt;personal information management&lt;/a&gt; (PIM), focused on individual skills, with &lt;a href=\"knowledge%20management\"&gt;knowledge management&lt;/a&gt; (KM) in addition to input from a variety of disciplines such as &lt;a href=\"cognitive%20psychology\"&gt;cognitive psychology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"management\"&gt;management&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; . From an organizational perspective, understanding of the field has developed in light of expanding knowledge about human &lt;a href=\"cognitive\"&gt;cognitive&lt;/a&gt; capabilities and the permeability of organizational boundaries. From a &lt;a href=\"metacognitive\"&gt;metacognitive&lt;/a&gt; perspective, it compares various modalities within human cognition as to their competence and efficacy . It is an underresearched area . More recently, research has been conducted to help understand \"the potential role of &lt;a href=\"Web%202.0\"&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/a&gt; technologies for harnessing and managing personal knowledge\" .\nModels.\n identified information retrieval, assessment and evaluation, organization, analysis, presentation, security, and collaboration as essential to PKM (cited in ). \nWright's model involves four interrelated domains: analytical, information, social, and learning. The analytical domain involves competencies such as interpretation, envisioning, application, creation, and contextualization. The information dimension comprises the sourcing, assessment, organization, aggregation, and communication of information. The social dimension involves finding and collaborating with people, the development of both close networks and extended networks, and dialogue. The learning dimension entails expanding pattern recognition and sensemaking capabilities, reflection, development of new knowledge, improvement of skills, and extension to others. This model stresses the importance of both bonding and bridging networks . \nIn Nonaka and Takeuchi's &lt;a href=\"SECI%20model%20of%20knowledge%20dimensions\"&gt;SECI model of knowledge dimensions&lt;/a&gt; (see under &lt;a href=\"knowledge%20management\"&gt;knowledge management&lt;/a&gt;), knowledge can be tacit or explicit, with the interaction of the two resulting in new knowledge . Smedley has developed a PKM model based on Nonaka and colleagues' model in which an expert provides direction while a &lt;a href=\"community%20of%20practice\"&gt;community of practice&lt;/a&gt; provides support for personal knowledge creation . Trust is central to knowledge sharing in this model. Nonaka has returned to his earlier work in an attempt to further develop his ideas about knowledge creation \nPersonal knowledge management can also be viewed along two main dimensions, personal &lt;a href=\"knowledge\"&gt;knowledge&lt;/a&gt; and personal &lt;a href=\"management\"&gt;management&lt;/a&gt; . Zhang has developed a model of PKM in relation to organizational knowledge management (OKM) that considers two axes of knowledge properties and management perspectives, either organizational or personal. These aspects of organizational and personal knowledge are interconnected through the OAPI process (organizationalize, aggregate, personalize, and individualize), whereby organizational knowledge is personalized and individualized and personal knowledge is aggregated and operationalized as organizational knowledge .\nCriticism.\nIt is not clear whether PKM is anything more than a new wrapper around &lt;a href=\"personal%20information%20management\"&gt;personal information management&lt;/a&gt; (PIM). William Jones argued that only personal information as a tangible resource can be managed, whereas personal knowledge cannot . &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Snowden\"&gt;Dave Snowden&lt;/a&gt; has asserted that most individuals cannot manage their knowledge in the traditional sense of \"managing\" and has advocated thinking in terms of &lt;a href=\"sensemaking\"&gt;sensemaking&lt;/a&gt; rather than PKM . Knowledge is not solely an individual product\u2014it emerges through connections, dialog, and social interaction (see &lt;a href=\"Sociology%20of%20knowledge\"&gt;Sociology of knowledge&lt;/a&gt;). However, in Wright's model, PKM involves the application to problem-solving of analytical, information, social, and learning dimensions, which are interrelated , and so is inherently social.\nAn aim of PKM is \"helping individuals to be more effective in personal, organizational and social environments\" , often through the use of technology such as networking software. It has been argued, however, that equation of PKM with technology has limited the value and utility of the concept (e.g. , ).\nIn 2012, Mohamed Chatti introduced the personal knowledge network (PKN) model to KM as an alternative perspective on PKM, based on the concepts of a personal knowledge network and knowledge ecology .\nSkills.\nSkills associated with personal knowledge management include:\nTools.\nSome organizations are introducing PKM \"systems\" with some or all of four components:\nPKM has also been linked to these tools:\nOther useful tools include stories and &lt;a href=\"narrative%20inquiry\"&gt;narrative inquiry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"decision%20support%20system\"&gt;decision support system&lt;/a&gt;s, various kinds of &lt;a href=\"Graph%20%28discrete%20mathematics%29\"&gt;node\u2013link diagram&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"argument%20map\"&gt;argument map&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mind%20map\"&gt;mind map&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"concept%20map\"&gt;concept map&lt;/a&gt;s), and similar &lt;a href=\"information%20visualization\"&gt;information visualization&lt;/a&gt; techniques. Individuals use these tools to capture ideas, expertise, experience, opinions or thoughts, and this \"voicing\" will encourage cognitive diversity and promote free exchanges away from a centralized policed knowledge repository. The goal is to facilitate knowledge sharing and personal content management."
