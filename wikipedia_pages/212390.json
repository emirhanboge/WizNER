    "text": "The tilde (), or , is a &lt;a href=\"grapheme\"&gt;grapheme&lt;/a&gt; with several uses. The name of the character came into English from &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20language\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn came from the &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Atitulus\"&gt;titulus&lt;/a&gt;\", meaning \"title\" or \"superscription\".\nOrigin.\nThe tilde was originally written over an omitted letter or several letters as a &lt;a href=\"scribal%20abbreviation\"&gt;scribal abbreviation&lt;/a&gt;, or \"mark of suspension\" and \"mark of contraction\", shown as a straight line when used with capitals. Thus, the commonly used words \"&lt;a href=\"Anno%20Domini\"&gt;Anno Domini&lt;/a&gt;\" were frequently abbreviated to \"Ao D\u00f1i\", with an elevated terminal with a suspension mark placed over the \"n\". Such a mark could denote the omission of one letter or several letters. This saved on the expense of the scribe's labour and the cost of vellum and ink. Medieval European charters written in Latin are largely made up of such abbreviated words with suspension marks and other abbreviations; only uncommon words were given in full.\nThe tilde has since been applied to a number of other uses as a &lt;a href=\"diacritic\"&gt;diacritic&lt;/a&gt; mark or a character in its own right. These are encoded in &lt;a href=\"Unicode\"&gt;Unicode&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"%23Precomposed%20Unicode%20characters\"&gt;many precomposed characters&lt;/a&gt; as well as individually at and , and there are &lt;a href=\"%23Similar%20characters\"&gt;additional similar characters&lt;/a&gt; for different roles. In &lt;a href=\"lexicography\"&gt;lexicography&lt;/a&gt;, the latter kind of tilde and the &lt;a href=\"swung%20dash\"&gt;swung dash&lt;/a&gt;, , are used in dictionaries to indicate the omission of the entry word.\nHistory.\nUse by medieval scribes.\nThe text of the &lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt; of 1086, relating for example, to the &lt;a href=\"manor%20of%20Molland\"&gt;manor of Molland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Devon\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; (see adjacent picture), is highly &lt;a href=\"Scribal%20abbreviation\"&gt;abbreviated&lt;/a&gt; as indicated by numerous tildes. \nThe text with abbreviations expanded is as follows:\nRole of mechanical typewriters.\nThe incorporation of the tilde into &lt;a href=\"ASCII\"&gt;ASCII&lt;/a&gt; is a direct result of its appearance as a distinct character on &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20%28language%29\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; mechanical &lt;a href=\"typewriters\"&gt;typewriters&lt;/a&gt; in the late nineteenth century. This symbol did not exist independently as a &lt;a href=\"sort%20%28typesetting%29\"&gt;type&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hot%20metal%20typesetting\"&gt;hot-lead&lt;/a&gt; printing character.\nOn typewriters designed for languages that routinely use &lt;a href=\"diacritic\"&gt;diacritic&lt;/a&gt;s (accent marks), a &lt;a href=\"dead%20key\"&gt;dead key&lt;/a&gt; mechanism was provided: a mark is made when a dead key is typed but, unlike normal keys, the paper carriage does not move on. To achieve an accented letter, the &lt;a href=\"Copy%20typist\"&gt;typist&lt;/a&gt; first typed the desired diacritic, then typed the letter to be accented. Since the diacritic key a 'dead key' had not moved the paper on, the letter was printed under the previously-printed accent. To add a diacritic to a capital letter on some typewriters, the upper-case [elevated] version of the accent could be produced using plus the diacritic key. On others, however, the &lt;a href=\"typebar\"&gt;typebar&lt;/a&gt; had two different diacritics so that users could only add accents to lower-case letters without manual intervention or other adjustment.\nFor most Western European languages, the only diacritics used are &lt;a href=\"acute%20accent\"&gt;acute&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"grave%20accent\"&gt;grave&lt;/a&gt; (, &lt;a href=\"circumflex\"&gt;circumflex&lt;/a&gt; () and &lt;a href=\"diaeresis%20%28diacritic%29\"&gt;diaeresis&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20%28diacritic%29\"&gt;umlaut&lt;/a&gt;, ): early typewriters for the European market included these as dead keys. Spanish and Portuguese uniquely use the tilde diacritic. In modern Spanish, the tilde accent is needed only for the characters and . Both were &lt;a href=\"Precomposed%20character\"&gt;precomposed&lt;/a&gt; as distinct graphemes and assigned to a single typebar, which sacrificed a key that was felt to be less important, usually the key. Portuguese, however, has two: and . Whereas it was just about possible to find one low-use key to sacrifice for Spanish, to find two sacrificial keys for Portuguese was impractical. Instead a single key was changed to a tilde dead key and was born as a distinct &lt;a href=\"grapheme\"&gt;grapheme&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe centralized ASCII tilde.\nASCII incorporated many of the overprinting lower-case diacritics from typewriters, including tilde. Overprinting was intended to work by putting a &lt;a href=\"backspace\"&gt;backspace&lt;/a&gt; code between the codes for letter and diacritic. However even at that time, mechanisms that could do this or any other overprinting were not widely available, did not work for capital letters, and were impossible on video displays, with the result that this concept failed to gain significant acceptance. Consequently, many of these diacritics (and the &lt;a href=\"underscore\"&gt;underscore&lt;/a&gt;) were quickly reused by software as additional syntax, basically becoming new types of syntactic symbols that a programming language could use. As this usage became predominant, &lt;a href=\"type%20design\"&gt;type design&lt;/a&gt; gradually evolved so these diacritic characters became larger and more vertically centered, making them useless as overprinted diacritics but much easier to read as free-standing characters that had come to be used for entirely different and novel purposes.\nConnection to Spanish.\nAs indicated by the etymological origin of the word \"tilde\" in English, this symbol has been closely associated with the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish language&lt;/a&gt;. The connection stems from the use of the tilde above the letter to form the (different) letter in Spanish, a feature shared by only &lt;a href=\"Tilde%23Palatal%20n\"&gt;a few other languages&lt;/a&gt;, most of which are historically connected to Spanish. This peculiarity can help non-native speakers quickly identify a text as being written in Spanish with little chance of error. In addition, most native speakers, although &lt;a href=\"names%20given%20to%20the%20Spanish%20language\"&gt;not all&lt;/a&gt;, use the word to refer to their language. Particularly during the 1990s, Spanish-speaking intellectuals and news outlets demonstrated support for the language and the culture by defending this letter against &lt;a href=\"globalisation\"&gt;globalisation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"computer\"&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt;isation trends that threatened to remove it from keyboards and other standardised products and codes. The &lt;a href=\"Instituto%20Cervantes\"&gt;Instituto Cervantes&lt;/a&gt;, founded by &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20government\"&gt;Spain's government&lt;/a&gt; to promote the Spanish language internationally, chose as its logo a highly stylised with a large tilde. The 24-hour news channel &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; in the US later adopted a similar strategy on its existing logo for the launch of its &lt;a href=\"CNN%20en%20Espa%C3%B1ol\"&gt;Spanish-language version&lt;/a&gt;. And similarly to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt; (NBA), the &lt;a href=\"Spain%20men%27s%20national%20basketball%20team\"&gt;Spain men's national basketball team&lt;/a&gt; is nicknamed \"\u00d1BA\".\nIn Spanish itself the word is used more generally for diacritics, including the stress-marking acute accent. The diacritic is more commonly called or , and is not considered an accent mark in Spanish, but rather simply a part of the letter (much like &lt;a href=\"tittle\"&gt;the dot&lt;/a&gt; over makes an character that is familiar to readers of English).\nUsage.\nCommon use.\nThis symbol (in US English) informally means &lt;a href=\"approximation\"&gt;\"approximately\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"about\", or \"around\", such as \"~30 minutes before\", meaning \"\"approximately\" 30 minutes before\". It can mean \"similar to\", including \"of the same &lt;a href=\"order%20of%20magnitude\"&gt;order of magnitude&lt;/a&gt; as\", such as \"\" meaning that and are of the same order of magnitude. Another approximation symbol is the &lt;a href=\"approximation%23Mathematics\"&gt;double tilde&lt;/a&gt; , meaning \"approximately equal to\". The tilde is also used to indicate &lt;a href=\"congruence%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;congruence&lt;/a&gt; of shapes by placing it over an symbol, thus . \nIn Japanese it is used in to indicate a range or interval: 5\u301c10 means between 5 and 10.\nIn the computing field, especially in &lt;a href=\"Unix\"&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt;-based systems, the tilde indicates the user's home directory.\nIn more recent digital usage, tildes on either side of a word or phrase have sometimes come to convey a particular tone that \"let[s] the enclosed words perform both sincerity and irony\", which can pre-emptively defuse a negative reaction. For example, &lt;a href=\"BuzzFeed%20News\"&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/a&gt; journalist Joseph Bernstein interprets the tildes in the following &lt;a href=\"Twitter%23Tweets\"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;:\nas a way of making it clear that both the author and reader are aware that the enclosed phrase \u2013 \"spirit of the season\" \u2013 \"is cliche and we know this quality is beneath our author, and we don't want you to think our author is a cliche person generally\".\nDiacritical use.\nIn some languages, the tilde is a &lt;a href=\"diacritic\"&gt;diacritic&lt;/a&gt; mark placed over a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20%28alphabet%29\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to indicate a change in its pronunciation:\nPitch.\nThe tilde was firstly used in the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20diacritics\"&gt;polytonic orthography&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt;, as a variant of the &lt;a href=\"circumflex\"&gt;circumflex&lt;/a&gt;, representing a rise in &lt;a href=\"pitch%20accent\"&gt;pitch&lt;/a&gt; followed by a return to standard pitch.\nAbbreviation.\nLater, it was used to make &lt;a href=\"scribal%20abbreviation\"&gt;abbreviations&lt;/a&gt; in medieval &lt;a href=\"Latin%20language\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; documents. When an or followed a vowel, it was often omitted, and a tilde (physically, a small ) was placed over the preceding vowel to indicate the missing letter; this is the origin of the use of tilde to indicate nasalization (compare &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20%28diacritic%29%23Umlaut\"&gt;the development of the umlaut&lt;/a&gt; as an abbreviation of .) The practice of using the tilde over a vowel to indicate omission of an or continued in printed books in &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; as a means of reducing text length until the 17th century. It was also used in &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20language\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tilde was also used occasionally to make other abbreviations, such as over the letter , making , &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aq%CC%83\"&gt;to signify the word \"que\"&lt;/a&gt; (\"that\").\nNasalization.\nIt is also as a small that the tilde originated when written above other letters, marking a &lt;a href=\"Latin%20language\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; which had been &lt;a href=\"elision\"&gt;elided&lt;/a&gt; in old Galician-Portuguese. In modern &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20language\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; it indicates &lt;a href=\"nasalization\"&gt;nasalization&lt;/a&gt; of the base vowel: \"hand\", from Lat. \"manu-\"; \"reasons\", from Lat. . This usage has been adopted in the orthographies of several &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20languages%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;native languages of South America&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Guarani%20language\"&gt;Guarani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nheengatu%20language\"&gt;Nheengatu&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in the &lt;a href=\"International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet\"&gt;International Phonetic Alphabet&lt;/a&gt; (IPA) and many other phonetic alphabets. For example, is the IPA transcription of the pronunciation of the French place-name \"&lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Breton%20language\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;, the symbol after a vowel means that the letter serves only to give the vowel a nasalised pronunciation, without being itself pronounced, as it normally is. For example, gives the pronunciation whereas gives .\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Morgenl%C3%A4ndische%20Gesellschaft\"&gt;DMG&lt;/a&gt; romanization of &lt;a href=\"Tunisian%20Arabic\"&gt;Tunisian Arabic&lt;/a&gt;, the tilde is used for nasal vowels \u00f5 and \u1e4f.\nPalatal n.\nThe tilded (, ) developed from the digraph in Spanish. In this language, is considered a separate letter called \"&lt;a href=\"%C3%91\"&gt;e\u00f1e&lt;/a&gt;\" (), rather than a letter-diacritic combination; it is placed in Spanish dictionaries between the letters and . In Spanish, the word \"tilde\" actually refers to diacritics in general, e.g. the acute accent in \"Jos\u00e9\", while the diacritic in is called \"virgulilla\" (). Current languages in which the tilded () is used for the &lt;a href=\"palatal%20nasal\"&gt;palatal nasal&lt;/a&gt; consonant include\nTone.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Vietnamese%20language\"&gt;Vietnamese&lt;/a&gt;, a tilde over a vowel represents a creaky rising &lt;a href=\"tone%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;tone&lt;/a&gt; (\"ng\u00e3\"). Letters with the tilde are not considered separate letters of the &lt;a href=\"Vietnamese%20alphabet\"&gt;Vietnamese alphabet&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational Phonetic Alphabet.\nIn &lt;a href=\"phonetics\"&gt;phonetics&lt;/a&gt;, a tilde is used as a &lt;a href=\"IPA%20diacritics\"&gt;diacritic that is placed&lt;/a&gt; above a letter, below it or &lt;a href=\"superimpose\"&gt;superimpose&lt;/a&gt;d onto the middle of it:\nLetter extension.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Estonian%20language\"&gt;Estonian&lt;/a&gt;, the symbol stands for the &lt;a href=\"close-mid%20back%20unrounded%20vowel\"&gt;close-mid back unrounded vowel&lt;/a&gt;, and it is considered an independent letter.\nOther uses.\nSome languages and alphabets use the tilde for other purposes:\nPrecomposed Unicode characters.\nThe following letters using the tilde as a diacritic exist as &lt;a href=\"Precomposed%20character\"&gt;precomposed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Combining%20character\"&gt;combining&lt;/a&gt; Unicode characters:\nPunctuation.\nThe tilde is used in various ways in punctuation:\nRange.\nIn some languages (though not generally in English), a tilde-like wavy dash may be used as &lt;a href=\"punctuation\"&gt;punctuation&lt;/a&gt; (instead of an unspaced &lt;a href=\"hyphen\"&gt;hyphen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"en%20dash\"&gt;en dash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"em%20dash\"&gt;em dash&lt;/a&gt;) between two &lt;a href=\"number\"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt;s, to indicate a &lt;a href=\"Interval%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt; rather than &lt;a href=\"subtraction\"&gt;subtraction&lt;/a&gt; or a hyphenated number (such as a part number or model number). For example, \"12~15\" means \"12 to 15\", \"~3\" means \"up to three\", and \"100~\" means \"100 and greater\". &lt;a href=\"Languages%20of%20East%20Asia\"&gt;East Asian languages&lt;/a&gt; almost always use this convention, but it is often done for clarity in some other languages as well. &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20language\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; uses the wavy dash and full-width em dash interchangeably for this purpose. In English, the tilde is often used to express ranges and model numbers in &lt;a href=\"electronics\"&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt;, but rarely in formal grammar or in type-set documents, as a wavy dash preceding a number sometimes represents an approximation (see below).\nApproximation.\nBefore a number the tilde can mean 'approximately'; '~42' means 'approximately 42'. When used with &lt;a href=\"currency%20symbol\"&gt;currency symbol&lt;/a&gt;s that precede the number (national conventions differ), the tilde precedes the symbol, thus for example '~$10' means 'about ten dollars'.\nThe symbols \u2248 (almost equal to) and \u2245 (approximately equal to) are among the other &lt;a href=\"approximation%23Unicode\"&gt;symbols used to express approximation&lt;/a&gt;.\nJapanese.\nThe is used for various purposes in Japanese, including to denote ranges of numbers, in place of dashes or brackets, and to indicate origin. The wave dash is also used to separate a title and a subtitle in the same line, as a &lt;a href=\"Colon%20%28punctuation%29\"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; is used in English.\nWhen used in conversations via email or instant messenger it may be used as a &lt;a href=\"sarcasm%20mark\"&gt;sarcasm mark&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sign is used as a replacement for the , katakana character, in Japanese, extending the final syllable.\nUnicode and Shift JIS encoding of wave dash.\nIn practice the (Unicode ), is often used instead of the (Unicode ), because the &lt;a href=\"Shift%20JIS\"&gt;Shift JIS&lt;/a&gt; code for the wave dash, 0x8160, which should be mapped to U+301C, is instead mapped to U+FF5E in &lt;a href=\"code%20page%20932%20%28Microsoft%20Windows%29\"&gt;Windows code page 932&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"code%20page\"&gt;code page&lt;/a&gt; for Japanese), a widely used extension of Shift JIS.\nThis decision avoided a shape definition error in the original (6.2) Unicode code charts: the wave dash reference glyph in JIS / Shift JIS matches the Unicode reference glyph for U+FF5E , while the original reference glyph for U+301C was reflected, incorrectly, when Unicode imported the JIS wave dash. In other platforms such as the &lt;a href=\"classic%20Mac%20OS\"&gt;classic Mac OS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"macOS\"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;, 0x8160 is correctly mapped to U+301C. It is generally difficult, if not impossible, for users of Japanese Windows to type U+301C, especially in legacy, non-Unicode applications.\nA similar situation exists regarding the Korean &lt;a href=\"KS%20X%201001\"&gt;KS X 1001&lt;/a&gt; character set, in which Microsoft maps the &lt;a href=\"EUC-KR\"&gt;EUC-KR&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Unified%20Hangul%20Code\"&gt;UHC&lt;/a&gt; code for the wave dash (0xA1AD) to , while &lt;a href=\"IBM\"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apple%2C%20Inc\"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; map it to U+301C. Microsoft also uses U+FF5E to map the KS X 1001 raised tilde (0xA2A6), while Apple uses .\nThe current Unicode reference glyph for U+301C has been corrected to match the JIS standard in response to a 2014 proposal, which noted that while the existing Unicode reference glyph had been matched by fonts from the discontinued &lt;a href=\"Windows%20XP\"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt;, all other major platforms including later versions of Microsoft Windows shipped with fonts matching the JIS reference glyph for U+301C.\nThe JIS / Shift JIS wave dash is still formally mapped to U+301C as of &lt;a href=\"JIS%20X%200213\"&gt;JIS X 0213&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the &lt;a href=\"WHATWG\"&gt;WHATWG&lt;/a&gt; Encoding Standard used by &lt;a href=\"HTML5\"&gt;HTML5&lt;/a&gt; follows Microsoft in mapping 0x8160 to U+FF5E. These two code points have a similar or identical glyph in several fonts, reducing the confusion and incompatibility.\nMathematics.\nAs a unary operator.\nA tilde in front of a single quantity can mean \"approximately\", \"about\" or \"of the same &lt;a href=\"order%20of%20magnitude\"&gt;order of magnitude&lt;/a&gt; as.\"\nIn written &lt;a href=\"mathematical%20logic\"&gt;mathematical logic&lt;/a&gt;, the tilde represents &lt;a href=\"negation\"&gt;negation&lt;/a&gt;: \"~\"p\"\" means \"not \"p\", where \"p\"\" is a &lt;a href=\"proposition\"&gt;proposition&lt;/a&gt;. Modern use often replaces the tilde with the negation symbol (\u00ac) for this purpose, to avoid confusion with &lt;a href=\"equivalence%20relation\"&gt;equivalence relation&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs a relational operator.\nIn &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, the tilde operator (Unicode U+223C), sometimes called \"twiddle\", is often used to denote an &lt;a href=\"equivalence%20relation\"&gt;equivalence relation&lt;/a&gt; between two objects. Thus \"\" means \" is &lt;a href=\"equivalence%20relation\"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; to \". It is a weaker statement than stating that &lt;a href=\"equality%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;equals&lt;/a&gt; . The expression \"\" is sometimes read aloud as \" twiddles \", perhaps as an analogue to the verbal expression of \"\".\nThe tilde can indicate approximate equality in a variety of ways. It can be used to denote the &lt;a href=\"asymptotic%20analysis\"&gt;asymptotic equality&lt;/a&gt; of two functions. For example, means that formula_1.\nA tilde is also used to indicate \"&lt;a href=\"Approximation\"&gt;approximately&lt;/a&gt; equal to\" (e.g. 1.902 ~= 2). This usage probably developed as a typed alternative to the used for the same purpose in written mathematics, which is an equal sign with the upper bar replaced by a bar with an upward hump, bump, or loop in the middle (\ufe0d\ufe0d\u264e\ufe0e) or, sometimes, a tilde (\u2243). The symbol \"\u2248\" is also used for this purpose.\nIn &lt;a href=\"physics\"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"astronomy\"&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, a tilde can be used between two expressions (e.g. ) to state that the two are of the same &lt;a href=\"order%20of%20magnitude\"&gt;order of magnitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"probability%20theory\"&gt;probability theory&lt;/a&gt;, the tilde means \"is distributed as\"; see &lt;a href=\"random%20variable\"&gt;random variable&lt;/a&gt;(e.g. X ~ B(n,p) for a binomial distribution).\nA tilde can also be used to represent geometric &lt;a href=\"Similarity%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;similarity&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. , meaning &lt;a href=\"triangle\"&gt;triangle&lt;/a&gt; is similar to ). A triple tilde (\u224b) is often used to show &lt;a href=\"congruence%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;congruence&lt;/a&gt;, an equivalence relation in geometry.\nAs an accent.\nThe symbol \"formula_2\" is pronounced as \"eff tilde\" or, informally, as \"eff twiddle\" or, in American English, \"eff wiggle\". This can be used to denote the &lt;a href=\"Fourier%20transform\"&gt;Fourier transform&lt;/a&gt; of \"f\", or a &lt;a href=\"lift%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;lift&lt;/a&gt; of \"f\", and can have a variety of other meanings depending on the context.\nA tilde placed below a letter in mathematics can represent a &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20vector\"&gt;vector&lt;/a&gt; quantity (e.g. formula_3).\nIn &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"probability%20theory\"&gt;probability theory&lt;/a&gt;, a tilde placed on top of a variable is sometimes used to represent the &lt;a href=\"median\"&gt;median&lt;/a&gt; of that variable; thus formula_4 would indicate the median of the variable formula_5. A tilde over the letter n (formula_6) is sometimes used to indicate the &lt;a href=\"harmonic%20mean\"&gt;harmonic mean&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn machine learning, a tilde may represent a candidate value for a cell state in &lt;a href=\"Gated%20recurrent%20unit\"&gt;GRUs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"LSTM\"&gt;LSTM&lt;/a&gt; units. (e.g. c\u0303)\nPhysics.\nOften in physics, one can consider an equilibrium solution to an equation, and then a perturbation to that equilibrium. For the variables in the original equation (for instance formula_7) a substitution formula_8 can be made, where formula_9 is the equilibrium part and formula_10 is the perturbed part.\nA tilde is also used in &lt;a href=\"particle%20physics\"&gt;particle physics&lt;/a&gt; to denote the hypothetical &lt;a href=\"supersymmetric\"&gt;supersymmetric&lt;/a&gt; partner. For example, an &lt;a href=\"electron\"&gt;electron&lt;/a&gt; is referred to by the letter \"e\", and its &lt;a href=\"superpartner\"&gt;superpartner&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"selectron%20%28particle%29\"&gt;selectron&lt;/a&gt; is written \"\u1ebd\".\nEconomics.\nFor relations involving preference, &lt;a href=\"economist\"&gt;economist&lt;/a&gt;s sometimes use the tilde to represent &lt;a href=\"Preference%20%28economics%29%23Notation\"&gt;indifference&lt;/a&gt; between two or more bundles of goods. For example, to say that a consumer is indifferent between bundles \"x\" and \"y\", an economist would write \"x\" ~ \"y\".\nElectronics.\nIt can approximate the sine wave symbol (\u223f, &lt;a href=\"Unicode\"&gt;U+&lt;/a&gt;223F), which is used in &lt;a href=\"electronics\"&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt; to indicate &lt;a href=\"alternating%20current\"&gt;alternating current&lt;/a&gt;, in place of +, \u2212, or \u2393 for &lt;a href=\"direct%20current\"&gt;direct current&lt;/a&gt;.\nLinguistics.\nThe tilde may indicate alternating &lt;a href=\"allomorph\"&gt;allomorph&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Morphophonology\"&gt;morphological alternation&lt;/a&gt;, as in for \"kneel~knelt\" (the &lt;a href=\"plus%20sign%23Other%20uses\"&gt;plus sign&lt;/a&gt; '+' indicates a morpheme boundary).\nThe tilde may represent some sort of phonetic or phonemic variation between two sounds, which might be &lt;a href=\"allophone\"&gt;allophone&lt;/a&gt;s or in &lt;a href=\"free%20variation\"&gt;free variation&lt;/a&gt;. For example, can represent \"either or \".\nIn &lt;a href=\"formal%20semantics%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;formal semantics&lt;/a&gt;, it is also used as a notation for the \"&lt;a href=\"squiggle%20operator\"&gt;squiggle operator&lt;/a&gt;\" which plays a key role in many theories of &lt;a href=\"focus%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt;.\nComputing.\nDirectories and URLs.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Unix\"&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"operating%20system\"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;s (including &lt;a href=\"AIX\"&gt;AIX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"BSD\"&gt;BSD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Linux\"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"macOS\"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;), tilde normally indicates the current user's &lt;a href=\"home%20directory\"&gt;home directory&lt;/a&gt;. For example, if the current user's home directory is , then the command is equivalent to , , or . This convention derives from the &lt;a href=\"Lear-Siegler\"&gt;Lear-Siegler&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ADM-3A\"&gt;ADM-3A&lt;/a&gt; terminal in common use during the 1970s, which happened to have the tilde symbol and the word \"Home\" (for moving the cursor to the upper left) on the same key. When prepended to a particular username, the tilde indicates that user's home directory (e.g., for the home directory of user , such as ).\nUsed in &lt;a href=\"Uniform%20Resource%20Locator\"&gt;URLs&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"World%20Wide%20Web\"&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;, it often denotes a personal website on a &lt;a href=\"Unix\"&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt;-based server. For example, might be the personal website of John Doe. This mimics the Unix shell usage of the tilde. However, when accessed from the web, file access is usually directed to a &lt;a href=\"subdirectory\"&gt;subdirectory&lt;/a&gt; in the user's home directory, such as or .\nIn URLs, the characters (or ) may substitute for a tilde if an input device lacks a tilde key. Thus, and will behave in the same manner.\nComputer languages.\nThe tilde is used in the &lt;a href=\"AWK\"&gt;AWK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"programming%20language\"&gt;programming language&lt;/a&gt; as part of the pattern match operators for &lt;a href=\"regular%20expression\"&gt;regular expression&lt;/a&gt;s:\nA variant of this, with the plain tilde replaced with codice_3, was adopted in &lt;a href=\"Perl\"&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt;, and this semi-standardization has led to the use of these operators in other programming languages, such as &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20programming%20language\"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"SQL\"&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt; variant of the database &lt;a href=\"PostgreSQL\"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"APL%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;APL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"MATLAB\"&gt;MATLAB&lt;/a&gt;, tilde represents the monadic logical function NOT, and in APL it additionally represents the dyadic &lt;a href=\"multiset\"&gt;multiset&lt;/a&gt; function \"without\" (&lt;a href=\"Complement%20%28set%20theory%29%23Relative%20complement\"&gt;set difference&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn &lt;a href=\"C%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt; the tilde character is used as &lt;a href=\"bitwise%20NOT\"&gt;bitwise NOT&lt;/a&gt; unary &lt;a href=\"Operators%20in%20C%20and%20C%2B%2B\"&gt;operator&lt;/a&gt;, following the notation in logic (an codice_4 causes a logical NOT, instead). This is also used by most languages based on or influenced by C, such as &lt;a href=\"C%2B%2B\"&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D%20programming%20language\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"C%20Sharp%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;C#&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"MySQL\"&gt;MySQL database&lt;/a&gt; also use tilde as bitwise invert as does Microsoft's SQL Server &lt;a href=\"Transact-SQL\"&gt;Transact-SQL (T-SQL)&lt;/a&gt; language. &lt;a href=\"JavaScript\"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; also uses tilde as bitwise NOT, and because JavaScript internally uses floats and the bitwise complement only works on integers, numbers are stripped of their decimal part before applying the operation. This has also given rise to using two tildes codice_5 as a short syntax for a cast to integer (numbers are stripped of their decimal part and changed into their complement, and then back).\nIn C++ and C#, the tilde is also used as the first character in a &lt;a href=\"Class%20%28computer%20science%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"method%20%28computer%20science%29\"&gt;method&lt;/a&gt; name (where the rest of the name must be the same name as the class) to indicate a &lt;a href=\"destructor%20%28computer%20science%29\"&gt;destructor&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 a special method which is called at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Object%20lifetime\"&gt;object's life&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn ASP.NET application tilde ('~') is used as a shortcut to the root of the application's virtual directory.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Cascading%20Style%20Sheets\"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; stylesheet language, the tilde is used for the indirect adjacent combinator as part of a selector.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"D%20programming%20language\"&gt;D programming language&lt;/a&gt;, the tilde is used as an &lt;a href=\"Array%20data%20structure\"&gt;array&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"concatenation\"&gt;concatenation&lt;/a&gt; operator, as well as to indicate an object destructor and bitwise not operator. Tilde operator can be overloaded for user types, and binary tilde operator is mostly used to merging two objects, or adding some objects to set of objects. It was introduced because plus operator can have different meaning in many situations. For example, what to do with \"120\" + \"14\" ? Is this a string \"134\" (addition of two numbers), or \"12014\" (concatenation of strings) or something else? D disallows + operator for arrays (and strings), and provides separate operator for concatenation (similarly &lt;a href=\"PHP\"&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; programming language solved this problem by using dot operator for concatenation, and + for number addition, which will also work on strings containing numbers).\nIn &lt;a href=\"Eiffel%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;Eiffel&lt;/a&gt;, the tilde is used for object comparison. If \"a\" and \"b\" denote objects, the boolean expression \"a\" ~ \"b\" has value true if and only if these objects are equal, as defined by the applicable version of the library routine \"is_equal\", which by default denotes field-by-field object equality but can be redefined in any class to support a specific notion of equality. If \"a\" and \"b\" are references, the object equality expression \"a\" ~ \"b\" is to be contrasted with \"a\" = \"b\" which denotes reference equality. Unlike the call \"a\".\"is_equal\" (\"b\"), the expression \"a\" ~ \"b\" is &lt;a href=\"type%20safety\"&gt;type-safe&lt;/a&gt; even in the presence of &lt;a href=\"Covariance%20and%20contravariance%20%28computer%20science%29\"&gt;covariance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Groovy%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;Apache Groovy programming language&lt;/a&gt; the tilde character is used as an operator mapped to the bitwiseNegate() method. Given a String the method will produce a java.util.regex.Pattern. Given an integer it will negate the integer bitwise like in C. codice_3 and codice_7 can in Groovy be used to match a regular expression.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Haskell%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt;, the tilde is used in type constraints to indicate type equality. Also, in pattern-matching, the tilde is used to indicate a lazy pattern match.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Inform\"&gt;Inform&lt;/a&gt; programming language, the tilde is used to indicate a quotation mark inside a quoted string. \nIn \"text mode\" of the &lt;a href=\"LaTeX\"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; typesetting language a tilde diacritic can be obtained using, e.g., codice_8, yielding \"\u00f1\". A stand-alone tilde can be obtained by using codice_9 or codice_10.\nIn \"math mode\" a tilde diacritic can be written as, e.g., codice_11. For a wider tilde codice_12 can be used. The codice_13 command produce a tilde-like binary relation symbol that is often used in mathematical expressions, and the double-tilde &lt;a href=\"%E2%89%88\"&gt;\u2248&lt;/a&gt; is obtained with codice_14. The codice_15 package also supports entering tildes directly, e.g., codice_16.\nIn both text and math mode, a tilde on its own (codice_17) renders a white space with no line breaking.\nIn &lt;a href=\"MediaWiki\"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Syntax%20%28programming%20languages%29\"&gt;syntax&lt;/a&gt;, four tildes are used as a shortcut for a user's signature.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Common%20Lisp\"&gt;Common Lisp&lt;/a&gt;, the tilde is used as the prefix for format specifiers in format strings.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Max/MSP\"&gt;Max/MSP&lt;/a&gt;, a tilde is used to denote objects that process at the computer's sampling rate, i.e. mainly those that deal with sound.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Standard%20ML\"&gt;Standard ML&lt;/a&gt;, the tilde is used as the prefix for negative numbers and as the unary negation operator.\nIn &lt;a href=\"OCaml\"&gt;OCaml&lt;/a&gt;, the tilde is used to specify the label for a labeled parameter.\nIn &lt;a href=\"R_%28programming_language%29\"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;, the tilde operator is used to separate the left- and right-hand sides in a model formula.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Object%20REXX\"&gt;Object REXX&lt;/a&gt;, the twiddle is used as a \"message send\" symbol. For example, codice_18 would cause the codice_19 method to act on the object codice_20's codice_21 attribute, returning the result of the operation. codice_22 returns the object that received the method rather than the result produced. Thus it can be used when the result need not be returned or when cascading methods are to be used. codice_23 would send multiple concurrent codice_24 messages, thus invoking the codice_24 method three consecutive times on the codice_26 object.\nBackup filenames.\nThe dominant &lt;a href=\"Unix\"&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt; convention for naming backup copies of files is appending a tilde to the original file name.\nIt originated with the &lt;a href=\"Emacs\"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; text editor and was adopted by many other editors and some command-line tools.\nEmacs also introduced an elaborate numbered backup scheme, with files named , and so on. It didn't catch on, as the rise of &lt;a href=\"version%20control\"&gt;version control&lt;/a&gt; software eliminates the need for this usage.\nMicrosoft filenames.\nThe tilde was part of &lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"filename%20mangling\"&gt;filename mangling&lt;/a&gt; scheme when it extended the &lt;a href=\"File%20Allocation%20Table\"&gt;FAT&lt;/a&gt; file system standard to support long filenames for &lt;a href=\"Microsoft%20Windows\"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Programs written prior to this development could only access filenames in the so-called &lt;a href=\"8.3%20filename\"&gt;8.3 format&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the filenames consisted of a maximum of eight characters from a restricted character set (e.g. no spaces), followed by a period, followed by three more characters. In order to permit these legacy programs to access files in the FAT file system, each file had to be given two names\u2014one long, more descriptive one, and one that conformed to the 8.3 format. This was accomplished with a name-mangling scheme in which the first six characters of the filename are followed by a tilde and a digit. For example, \" might become \".\nThe tilde symbol is also often used to prefix hidden temporary files that are created when a document is opened in Windows. For example, when a document \"Document1.doc\" is opened in Word, a file called \"~$cument1.doc\" is created in the same directory. This file contains information about which user has the file open, to prevent multiple users from attempting to change a document at the same time.\nOther uses.\n&lt;a href=\"Computer%20programmers\"&gt;Computer programmers&lt;/a&gt; use the tilde in various ways and sometimes call the symbol (as opposed to the diacritic) a squiggle, squiggly, swiggle, or twiddle. According to the &lt;a href=\"Jargon%20File\"&gt;Jargon File&lt;/a&gt;, other synonyms sometimes used in programming include not, approx, wiggle, enyay (after \"&lt;a href=\"%C3%B1\"&gt;e\u00f1e&lt;/a&gt;\") and (humorously) sqiggle . It is used in many languages as a binary inversion operator, swapping a number's binary 1's and 0's for example ~10 (binary ~1010) is equal to 5 (binary 0101).\nIn &lt;a href=\"Raku%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;Raku&lt;/a&gt;, is used instead of for a &lt;a href=\"regular%20expression\"&gt;regular expression&lt;/a&gt;.\nJuggling notation.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"juggling%20notation\"&gt;juggling notation&lt;/a&gt; system Beatmap, tilde can be added to either \"hand\" in a pair of fields to say \"cross the arms with this hand on top\". &lt;a href=\"Mills%20Mess\"&gt;Mills Mess&lt;/a&gt; is thus represented as (~2x,1)(1,2x)(2x,~1)*.\nSimilar characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Unicode\"&gt;Unicode&lt;/a&gt; has code-points for many forms of tilde, for symbols incorporating tildes, and for characters visually similar to a tilde:\nASCII tilde (U+007E).\nMost modern fonts align the plain ASCII &lt;a href=\"spacing%20character\"&gt;spacing&lt;/a&gt; tilde at the same level as &lt;a href=\"dash\"&gt;dash&lt;/a&gt;es, or only slightly upper. This makes it useless for the tilde's original purpose on typewriters, which was to overprint above a character as a diacritic, but does make modern use as an operator easier to read. Some &lt;a href=\"monospace%20font\"&gt;monospace font&lt;/a&gt;s do raise the tilde. On older printers which could overprint the tilde was often raised to allow it's use as a diacritic. An always-raised \"small tilde\"\u00a0 was introduced with &lt;a href=\"Windows-1252\"&gt;Windows-1252&lt;/a&gt; to allow reproduction of older text appearance.\nKeyboards.\nWhere a tilde is on the keyboard depends on the computer's language settings according to the following chart. On many keyboards it is primarily available through a &lt;a href=\"dead%20key\"&gt;dead key&lt;/a&gt; that makes it possible to produce a variety of &lt;a href=\"precomposed%20character\"&gt;precomposed character&lt;/a&gt;s with the diacritic. In that case, a single tilde can typically be inserted with the dead key followed by the space bar, or alternatively by striking the dead key twice in a row.\nTo insert a tilde with the dead key, it is often necessary to simultaneously hold down the &lt;a href=\"Alt%20Gr\"&gt;Alt Gr&lt;/a&gt; key. With a &lt;a href=\"Macintosh\"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt; either of the Alt/&lt;a href=\"Option%20key\"&gt;Option&lt;/a&gt; keys function similarly.\nIn the US and European &lt;a href=\"Windows\"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; systems, the &lt;a href=\"Alt%20code\"&gt;Alt code&lt;/a&gt; for a single tilde is codice_27."
