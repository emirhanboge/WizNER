    "text": "Kongstedlund is an old &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"manor%20house\"&gt;manor house&lt;/a&gt; built in 1592 in the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance-style&lt;/a&gt; and situated on the peninsula of &lt;a href=\"Himmerland\"&gt;Himmerland&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Aalborg\"&gt;Aalborg&lt;/a&gt;. Kongstedtlund is not open to the public, but the building can be seen from the nearby road.\nArchitecture.\nKongstedlund was built on the foundations of an ancient, storied &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;, and is surrounded by drained &lt;a href=\"moat\"&gt;moat&lt;/a&gt;s. The main building was constructed in 1592 for the &lt;a href=\"Danish%20nobility\"&gt;Danish nobleman&lt;/a&gt; Niels Juul. In 1640, a &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Baroque\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt;-style was added to the entrance of the main building by the owners of the property, Ivar Krabbe and Dorte Juul. In the 1770s, a low &lt;a href=\"Timber%20framing\"&gt;half-timbered&lt;/a&gt; wing was attached to the main building. Kongstedtlund rests upon an old arched &lt;a href=\"Vault%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;vault&lt;/a&gt; that has remained as part of the older construction. The mansion's facades are now whitewashed, but were originally made unpainted brick. The levels of the main building are marked by &lt;a href=\"anchor%20plate\"&gt;anchor plate&lt;/a&gt;s. The rectangle windows are embedded in curved window slots. The &lt;a href=\"gable\"&gt;gable&lt;/a&gt;s are now adjusted to the saddle roof in a straight line, but were originally probably arched in the style of the Renaissance. The baroque sandstone portal with the &lt;a href=\"initial\"&gt;initial&lt;/a&gt;s of the owners by that time, Ivar Krabbe and Dorte Juul, is a particularly precious architectural detail.\nThe most prominent elements of the portal are the &lt;a href=\"sculpture\"&gt;sculpture&lt;/a&gt;s of two &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s in full armour framing the entrance, as well as those of two &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s, on which the uppermost part of the portal rests, and two female figures in the upper part which are framing a family &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;coat of arms&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"laurel%20wreath\"&gt;laurel wreath&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoyal inhabitant.\nFrom 1922 to 1961, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Dagmar%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Princess Dagmar of Demark&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20VIII%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Frederick VIII of Denmark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Louise%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Louise of Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, lived on Kongstedlund. She was married to the &lt;a href=\"squire\"&gt;squire&lt;/a&gt; Jorgen Castenskiold, &lt;a href=\"Hofj%C3%A6germester\"&gt;hunting master of the Danish court&lt;/a&gt; and member of the ennobled Danish family Castenskiold.\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20castles%20and%20palaces%20in%20Denmark\"&gt;List of castles and palaces in Denmark&lt;/a&gt;"
