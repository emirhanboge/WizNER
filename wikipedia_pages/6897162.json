    "text": "Caribbean Gardens was a &lt;a href=\"Market%20%28place%29\"&gt;market&lt;/a&gt;, gardens and amusement park located in the outer &lt;a href=\"east\"&gt;east&lt;/a&gt;ern suburb of &lt;a href=\"Scoresby%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Scoresby&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaribbean Gardens and Market operated from 1965 when it started with only a handful of traders selling wares from their car boots and Water ski shows. What once was \u201ca handful of traders\u201d grew into a bustling undercover market with over 1000 stall sites. It was known as one of the largest markets in Victoria, occupying a 10,500 m2 pavilion.\nOn the 1st of July 2020, it was announced that the park would close permanently after the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; forced a temporary closure which greatly impacted the park financially. Despite the closure, 'Caribbean Market supporters are calling for the \u201cinstitution\u201d to be saved'. After the official announcement, the Facebook post on the Caribbean Market's page attracted over 5000 comments of support.\nHistory.\nIn 1958, whilst overseas, he found the material known as fibreglass and realised its potential in the boat-building industry. Soon after, he established the Caribbean Boat Factory. It soon became necessary to have a lake for the testing of the boats and in the early 1960s, Lake Caribbean was built. It was subsequently opened to the public and developed by one of his sons, Rod Spooner, as Caribbean Gardens.\nThe site is significant being Victoria's \"first local example\" of a theme park, with many original features (Japanese gardens, railway, chairlift, jungle cruise &amp; picnic areas) still intact today.\nIt was noted in the Woman's Weekly, 1966 that the Spooner family 'aims to turn the area into a kind of local Disneyland, and already the shores many islets at one end of the lake are dotted with fl fibreglass crocodiles, elephants, hippopotamuses'. The park also included 'ski kite-riding from the Cypress Gardens' in the US.\nThe chairlift ride was built by Jack Griffiths and chairlift manufacturer Ron McCallum, originally from Whistlestop Amusement Park in Skye Road, Frankston which closed in 1974. \nCaribbean Gardens also has a preserved sugarcane locomotive (1924) from Victoria Mill, Ingham.\nThe park also has a number of other features including cast iron street lamps originally from Melbourne dotted around the gardens."
