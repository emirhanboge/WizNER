    "text": "The Berliner Philharmonie () is a &lt;a href=\"concert%20hall\"&gt;concert hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and home to the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Philharmonic\"&gt;Berlin Philharmonic&lt;/a&gt; Orchestra.\nThe Philharmonie lies on the south edge of the city's &lt;a href=\"Tiergarten%20%28Berlin%29\"&gt;Tiergarten&lt;/a&gt; and just west of the former &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Wall\"&gt;Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt;. The Philharmonie is on &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20von%20Karajan\"&gt;Herbert-von-Karajan&lt;/a&gt;-Stra\u00dfe, named for the orchestra's longest-serving principal conductor. The building forms part of the &lt;a href=\"Kulturforum\"&gt;Kulturforum&lt;/a&gt; complex of cultural institutions close to &lt;a href=\"Potsdamer%20Platz\"&gt;Potsdamer Platz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Philharmonie consists of two venues, the Grand Hall (\"Gro\u00dfer Saal\") with 2,440 seats and the Chamber Music Hall (\"Kammermusiksaal\") with 1,180 seats. Though conceived together, the smaller hall was opened in the 1980s, some twenty years after the main building.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Hans%20Scharoun\"&gt;Hans Scharoun&lt;/a&gt; designed the building, which was constructed over the years 1960\u20131963. It opened on 15 October 1963 with Herbert von Karajan conducting Beethoven's &lt;a href=\"Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29\"&gt;9th Symphony&lt;/a&gt;. It was built to replace the old Philharmonie, destroyed by British bombers on 30 January 1944, the eleventh anniversary of &lt;a href=\"Hitler\"&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt; becoming Chancellor. The hall is a singular building, asymmetrical and tentlike, with the main concert hall in the shape of a &lt;a href=\"pentagon\"&gt;pentagon&lt;/a&gt;. The height of the rows of seats increases irregularly with distance from the stage. The stage is at the centre of the hall, surrounded by seating on all sides. The so-called &lt;a href=\"Vineyard%20style%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;vineyard-style&lt;/a&gt; seating arrangement (with terraces rising around a central orchestral platform) was pioneered by this building, and became a model for other concert halls, including the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt; (1973), Denver's &lt;a href=\"Boettcher%20Concert%20Hall\"&gt;Boettcher Concert Hall&lt;/a&gt; (1978), the &lt;a href=\"Gewandhaus\"&gt;Gewandhaus&lt;/a&gt; in Leipzig (1981), &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20Concert%20Hall\"&gt;Walt Disney Concert Hall&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles (2003), and the &lt;a href=\"Philharmonie%20de%20Paris\"&gt;Philharmonie de Paris&lt;/a&gt; (2014).\nJazz pianist &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Brubeck\"&gt;Dave Brubeck&lt;/a&gt; and his quartet recorded three live performances at the hall; \"&lt;a href=\"Dave%20Brubeck%20in%20Berlin\"&gt;Dave Brubeck in Berlin&lt;/a&gt;\" (1964), \"&lt;a href=\"Live%20at%20the%20Berlin%20Philharmonie\"&gt;Live at the Berlin Philharmonie&lt;/a&gt;\" (1970), and \"&lt;a href=\"We%27re%20All%20Together%20Again%20for%20the%20First%20Time\"&gt;We're All Together Again for the First Time&lt;/a&gt;\" (1973). &lt;a href=\"Miles%20Davis\"&gt;Miles Davis&lt;/a&gt;'s at the hall has also been released on DVD.\nOn 20 May 2008 a fire broke out at the hall. A quarter of the roof suffered considerable damage as firefighters cut openings to reach the flames beneath the roof. The hall interior sustained water damage but was otherwise \"generally unharmed\". Firefighters limited damage using foam. The cause of the fire was attributed to welding work, and no serious damage was caused either to the structure or interior of the building. Performances resumed, as scheduled, on 1 June 2008 with a concert by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Symphony\"&gt;San Francisco Symphony&lt;/a&gt; Youth Orchestra.\nOrgans.\nMain organ.\nThe main organ was built by the &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Schuke\"&gt;Karl Schuke&lt;/a&gt; Orgelbauwerkstatt, Berlin, in 1965, and renovated in 1992, 2012 and 2016. It has four &lt;a href=\"manual%20%28music%29\"&gt;manuals&lt;/a&gt; and 91 &lt;a href=\"Organ%20stop\"&gt;stops&lt;/a&gt;. The pipes of the choir organs and the Tuba 16' and Tuba 8' stops are not assigned to any group and can be played from all four manuals and the pedals."
