    "text": "The 2009\u201310 season was French &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20Lyonnais\"&gt;Olympique Lyonnais&lt;/a&gt;'s 51st season in &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;Ligue 1&lt;/a&gt; and was their 21st consecutive season in the top division of &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20France\"&gt;French football&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time in seven years, Lyon entered the football season without defending the Ligue 1 title. They were overthrown by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt; who claimed the title on the final day of &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Ligue%201\"&gt;2008\u201309 season&lt;/a&gt;. This was also the first time in nine years Lyon had to earn qualification to the group stage of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; as they began from the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Play-off%20round\"&gt;playoff round&lt;/a&gt;, due to their third-place finish last season.\nNews.\nOn 6 June 2009, it was announced by Lyon that fitness coach Robert Duverne had quit his position to focus full-time on the &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;French national team&lt;/a&gt;, who were attempting to &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%E2%80%93%20UEFA%20Group%207\"&gt;qualify&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Vincent Espi\u00e9, who had previously worked as fitness coach for &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Puel\"&gt;Claude Puel&lt;/a&gt;'s former club &lt;a href=\"Lille%20OSC\"&gt;Lille&lt;/a&gt;, was brought in as his replacement.\nDepartures this summer include long time Lyonnais &lt;a href=\"Juninho%20Pernambucano\"&gt;Juninho&lt;/a&gt;, who, after spending a respectable eight seasons at the club, moved to &lt;a href=\"Qatar\"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;i club &lt;a href=\"Al-Gharafa%20Sports%20Club\"&gt;Al-Gharafa&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28football%29\"&gt;Defender&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Paillot\"&gt;Sandy Paillot&lt;/a&gt; joined fellow &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;Ligue 1&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Grenoble%20Foot%2038\"&gt;Grenoble&lt;/a&gt; for a fee of &lt;a href=\"Euro\"&gt;\u20ac&lt;/a&gt;2 million after spending almost a year-and-a-half on loan at the club. Also during this summer window, a host of youth players who were either deemed surplus to requirements or looking to find some significant playing time departed the club. &lt;a href=\"Pierrick%20Valdivia\"&gt;Pierrick Valdivia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayan%20Si-Mohamed\"&gt;Ayan Si-Mohamed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexis%20Carra\"&gt;Alexis Carra&lt;/a&gt; moved to &lt;a href=\"CS%20Sedan%20Ardennes\"&gt;Sedan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Reims\"&gt;Stade Reims&lt;/a&gt; and Italian club &lt;a href=\"Vicenza%20Calcio\"&gt;Vicenza&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Midfielder &lt;a href=\"Romain%20Dedola\"&gt;Romain Dedola&lt;/a&gt; and defender &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Ancian\"&gt;Morgan Ancian&lt;/a&gt; both joined &lt;a href=\"RC%20Strasbourg\"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Quentin%20Barlet\"&gt;Quentin Barlet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%A9my%20Dequelson\"&gt;J\u00e9r\u00e9my Dequelson&lt;/a&gt; joined lesser rivals &lt;a href=\"AS%20Lyon%20Duch%C3%A8re\"&gt;Lyon Duch\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;. Another youth player, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%A9my%20Pied\"&gt;J\u00e9r\u00e9my Pied&lt;/a&gt;, joined &lt;a href=\"FC%20Metz\"&gt;Metz&lt;/a&gt; on loan for the entire &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Ligue%202\"&gt;2009\u201310 season&lt;/a&gt; with hopes that the player will receive greater playing time.\nOn 1 July 2009, Lyon surprisingly announced that they had reached an agreement with Spanish club &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; for the transfer of &lt;a href=\"Karim%20Benzema\"&gt;Karim Benzema&lt;/a&gt;, who reportedly wanted to stay at least one more year with his hometown club. The transfer fee was priced at \u20ac35m with the fee rising to as much as \u20ac41m based on incentives. A day later, Lyon confirmed the departure of &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B4te%20d%27Ivoire\"&gt;Ivorian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Winger%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;winger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Kader%20Ke%C3%AFta\"&gt;Abdul Kader Ke\u00efta&lt;/a&gt; who, despite being Lyon's highest paid transfer at that time, failed to live up to expectations. Ke\u00efta moved to &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Galatasaray%20S.K.%20%28football%29\"&gt;Galatasaray&lt;/a&gt;, with Lyon earning \u20ac8.5 million for the player. On 5 August, the club announced the departure of striker &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Piquionne\"&gt;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piquionne&lt;/a&gt;, who joined English club &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%20F.C.\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; on loan for the entire season. One week later, various sources in France reported that defender &lt;a href=\"John%20Mensah\"&gt;John Mensah&lt;/a&gt; would be joining English club &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; on loan for the season, with the club also having an option to purchase the player for a fee of \u20ac7\u00a0million following the season. The move was subject to Mensah passing a medical and being granted a work permit, which was completed a week-and-a-half later.\nOn 7 July, Lyon confirmed their first transfer arrival to the club. After almost two weeks of negotiations with Portuguese club &lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt;, Lyon reached an agreement on a transfer fee for the Argentine &lt;a href=\"Striker%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;striker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lisandro%20L%C3%B3pez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29\"&gt;Lisandro L\u00f3pez&lt;/a&gt;. The transfer fee was priced at &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;\u20ac&lt;/a&gt;24\u00a0million, with the fee rising to as much as \u20ac28\u00a0million with incentives, thereby making L\u00f3pez the club's most expensive signing. The following week, Lyon addressed an important need after reaching an agreement with &lt;a href=\"Lille%20OSC\"&gt;Lille&lt;/a&gt; for the transfer of the Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Midfielder\"&gt;left winger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Bastos\"&gt;Michel Bastos&lt;/a&gt;, with the transfer fee being approximately \u20ac18\u00a0million. Two days later, Lyon filled another need, signing another Porto player in &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28football%29\"&gt;left back&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aly%20Cissokho\"&gt;Aly Cissokho&lt;/a&gt; for \u20ac15 million. An additional incentive involved in the deal is Porto will receive 20 percent of any future transfer fee Lyon receives for the player. On 29 July, Lyon, who admitted they needed at least one more striker, announced the signing of &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;French international&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Baf%C3%A9timbi%20Gomis\"&gt;Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Derby%20du%20Rh%C3%B4ne\"&gt;rivals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"AS%20Saint-%C3%89tienne\"&gt;Saint-\u00c9tienne&lt;/a&gt;, with the fee being approximately \u20ac13 million.\nBefore the summer signings, Lyon announced that two youth players would be promoted to the club's first team after agreeing to professional contracts. &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28football%29\"&gt;Defender&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lo%C3%AFc%20Abenzoar\"&gt;Lo\u00efc Abenzoar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"midfielder\"&gt;midfielder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maxime%20Gonalons\"&gt;Maxime Gonalons&lt;/a&gt; both agreed to three-year professional contracts tying them to the club until 2012. Also, following the season, Lyon signed left back &lt;a href=\"Timoth%C3%A9e%20Kolodziejczak\"&gt;Timoth\u00e9e Kolodziejczak&lt;/a&gt;, who had been on a season long loan from &lt;a href=\"RC%20Lens\"&gt;Lens&lt;/a&gt;. Kolodziejczak agreed to a four-year contract and Lyon paid Lens \u20ac2.5 million. Lyon also completed the signing of 16-year-old &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%A9my%20Frick\"&gt;J\u00e9r\u00e9my Frick&lt;/a&gt;, who signed a two-year deal. Frick, formerly of &lt;a href=\"Servette%20FC\"&gt;Servette&lt;/a&gt;, will join the club's &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20Lyonnais%20Reserves%20and%20Academy\"&gt;youth academy&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransfers.\nWinter In.\nTotal spending: &lt;a href=\"Euro\"&gt;\u20ac&lt;/a&gt;82.5\u00a0million\nWinter out.\nTotal income: &lt;a href=\"Euro\"&gt;\u20ac&lt;/a&gt;50\u00a0million\nSquad.\n\"Last updated 15 May 2010\"\nTeam kit.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbro\"&gt;Umbro&lt;/a&gt; will manufacture the kits for Lyon. Umbro have been the official &lt;a href=\"Kit%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;kit&lt;/a&gt; provider of Lyon since 2003 and, two years ago, signed an extension with Lyon until 2013. This season, Lyon will have brand-new home, away, Champions League kits, which were revealed to the &lt;a href=\"general%20public\"&gt;public&lt;/a&gt; on 12 July, despite the shirts leaking on 17 June. The home shirt has a white base color, with the horizontal red and blue stripe in the middle, reverting from the club's red and blue vertical stripe that has been used in previous years. The &lt;a href=\"logo\"&gt;logo&lt;/a&gt; of Umbro appears on the top-right of the shirt in blue. The away shirt features a black and red design. The top part of the shirt is black and it fades horizontally in the middle into red. The shirt has a partly red collar, and also has red details on the black sleeves. The &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; kit is midnight blue with the horizontal red and blue stripe locating in the middle of the shirt.\nPre-season.\nLyon opened their pre-season in their usual setting training in the mountainous &lt;a href=\"Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes\"&gt;Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes&lt;/a&gt; commune of &lt;a href=\"Tignes\"&gt;Tignes&lt;/a&gt;. Lyon confirmed several &lt;a href=\"preseason\"&gt;preseason&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20match\"&gt;friendly matches&lt;/a&gt;. Lyon also participated in the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Cup\"&gt;Peace Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the fourth time having won the exhibition tournament in 2007. On 11 July, Lyon opened up their pre-season facing fellow &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;Ligue 1&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"OGC%20Nice\"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Albertville\"&gt;Albertville&lt;/a&gt;. Lyon won the match 1\u20130 with the lone goal of the match coming from &lt;a href=\"Ederson%20Honorato%20Campos\"&gt;Ederson&lt;/a&gt; in the 12th minute of play. \nA week later, Lyon hosted &lt;a href=\"RC%20Lens\"&gt;Lens&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arnas%2C%20Rh%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Arnas&lt;/a&gt;. Lyon trailed 0\u20132 heading into the 80th minute with both of Lens goals being scored as a result of Lyon mistakes. The first goal being scored due to an unexpected turnover by &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Govou\"&gt;Sidney Govou&lt;/a&gt; and the second being scored as a result of casual, yet lazy play between defensemen &lt;a href=\"Jean-Alain%20Boumsong\"&gt;Jean-Alain Boumsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Timoth%C3%A9e%20Kolodziejczak\"&gt;Timoth\u00e9e Kolodziejczak&lt;/a&gt;, with the former being more responsible. Lyon completed the comeback with both of their goals being scored by the &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Swede&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kim%20K%C3%A4llstr%C3%B6m\"&gt;Kim K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m&lt;/a&gt;, the first being a &lt;a href=\"direct%20free%20kick\"&gt;free kick&lt;/a&gt; in the 85th minute and the second in the 89th minute to draw the match at 2\u20132, which was the final scoreline.\nFrom 24 July to 2 August, Lyon will be among several top clubs that will participate in the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Cup%202009\"&gt;2009 Peace Cup&lt;/a&gt; held in &lt;a href=\"Andalusia\"&gt;Andalusia&lt;/a&gt;, Spain. Clubs playing in their group and whom they will face are &lt;a href=\"Primeira%20Liga%202008%E2%80%9309\"&gt;defending Primeira Liga champions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"S%C3%BCper%20Lig%202008%E2%80%9309\"&gt;2008\u201309 S\u00fcper Lig champions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F%20J.K.\"&gt;Be\u015fikta\u015f&lt;/a&gt;, whom they played first. Lyon controlled the match for the majority of and eventually got a goal in the 69th minute from &lt;a href=\"Kim%20K%C3%A4llstr%C3%B6m\"&gt;Kim K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m&lt;/a&gt; after a nice backheel assist from &lt;a href=\"Miralem%20Pjani%C4%87\"&gt;Miralem Pjani\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. Leading 1\u20130 heading into the final minutes, Lyon's defense fell off, with Be\u015fikta\u015f's first chance being cleared off the line by Pjani\u0107 leading to a corner. On the ensuing corner, the Turkish club &lt;a href=\"Equaliser%20%28sports%29\"&gt;equalised&lt;/a&gt; with the goal coming off the head of &lt;a href=\"Mert%20Nobre\"&gt;Mert Nobre&lt;/a&gt; in the 84th minute. That would be the eventual scoreline giving both clubs one point heading into their matches with Porto. In the match, Lyon suffered their first defeat of the season losing 0\u20132 with both of Porto's goals being scored by the Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Hulk%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Hulk&lt;/a&gt; eliminating Lyon from the Peace Cup and also ending their preseason with 11 days to spare ahead of their opening league match against &lt;a href=\"Le%20Mans%20Union%20Club%2072\"&gt;Le Mans&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn 28 July, however, Lyon announced that on 30 July, they will play &lt;a href=\"La%20Liga\"&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Sevilla%20FC\"&gt;Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;, who were also eliminated from the Peace Cup, in a friendly match at the &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Ram%C3%B3n%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Pizju%C3%A1n\"&gt;Estadio Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;. They later announced, upon the club's return to France, they will face another La Liga side in &lt;a href=\"Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a\"&gt;Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aix-les-Bains\"&gt;Aix-les-Bains&lt;/a&gt;. In the Sevilla match, despite the debut of Lisandro L\u00f3pez and boasting an almost full strength side, Lyon failed to get on the scoreboard losing 0\u20131 making the defeat their second straight loss in the preseason. Three days later, Lyon earned a positive result drawing 2\u20132 with Deportivo with both of their goals coming from new players Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis and L\u00f3pez. Lyon ended the preseason with a record of one win, three draws and two defeats.\nFriendly\nPeace Cup\nCompetitions.\nLigue 1.\nOlympique Lyonnais began their league campaign on the road taking on &lt;a href=\"Le%20Mans%20Union%20Club%2072\"&gt;Le Mans&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20L%C3%A9on-Boll%C3%A9e\"&gt;Stade L\u00e9on-Boll\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;. Lyon started off the match very slow and eventually allowed a goal that was scored by &lt;a href=\"Modibo%20Ma%C3%AFga\"&gt;Modibo Ma\u00efga&lt;/a&gt; in just the 21st minute. Lyon responded just seven minutes later with a goal from the converted defender &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bodmer\"&gt;Mathieu Bodmer&lt;/a&gt;, who equalized on a shot at the top of the box as a result of a great pass from &lt;a href=\"Lisandro%20L%C3%B3pez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29\"&gt;Lisandro L\u00f3pez&lt;/a&gt;. Following the break, Le Mans came out quickly in the attack and were awarded a questionable &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt; by referee Lionel Jaffredo. The young &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Coutadeur\"&gt;Mathieu Coutadeur&lt;/a&gt; converted the penalty giving the home team a 2\u20131 lead. In the ensuing minutes, Lyon slowly lost focus, but were eventually revived when new signing &lt;a href=\"Baf%C3%A9timbi%20Gomis\"&gt;Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis&lt;/a&gt; came on in the 77th minute. Their newfound attack still drew no goals and heading into the &lt;a href=\"injury%20time\"&gt;injury time&lt;/a&gt; session, Lyon were awarded a &lt;a href=\"Direct%20free%20kick\"&gt;free kick&lt;/a&gt; just outside the penalty box. With new signings and free kick specialists &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Bastos\"&gt;Michel Bastos&lt;/a&gt; and L\u00f3pez both standing over the ball, it was the latter who took it and placed the ball easily into the back of the net drawing the match at 2\u20132 and giving Lyon their first point of the season. Lyon's first at home was against &lt;a href=\"Valenciennes%20FC\"&gt;Valenciennes&lt;/a&gt;. With a pivotal Champions League match coming up early next week and &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%A9my%20Toulalan\"&gt;J\u00e9r\u00e9my Toulalan&lt;/a&gt; also going on international duty, he was partially rested for the match, which featured the midfield combination of &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Makoun\"&gt;Jean Makoun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20K%C3%A4llstr%C3%B6m\"&gt;Kim K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m&lt;/a&gt;. Lyon won the match 1\u20130 with a goal from Gomis, his first with the club, in the 37th minute. The goal was assisted on by Michel Bastos. The victory initially moved Lyon into fourth-place, but after the next day's matches, Lyon fell to eighth. The following week, Lyon faced &lt;a href=\"AJ%20Auxerre\"&gt;Auxerre&lt;/a&gt; on the road. After their strong performance mid-week in the Champions League, manager &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Puel\"&gt;Claude Puel&lt;/a&gt; implemented exactly the same formation, albeit with different players in certain positions. Despite missing several goal opportunities mid-week, &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9sar%20Delgado\"&gt;C\u00e9sar Delgado&lt;/a&gt; responded by dishing out two assists, the first on the club's opening goal scored by &lt;a href=\"Jean-Alain%20Boumsong\"&gt;Jean-Alain Boumsong&lt;/a&gt;, who was making his season debut, and the club's second goal, scored by &lt;a href=\"Miralem%20Pjani%C4%87\"&gt;Miralem Pjani\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, his first career league goal for the club. Lyon won the match 3\u20130. The Auxerre match was notable as it marked the debut of the highly rated 17-year-old &lt;a href=\"Ishak%20Belfodil\"&gt;Ishak Belfodil&lt;/a&gt;, who came on as a substitute in the 84th minute. The next week, Lyon returned home and were victors again claiming a 3\u20131 victory over &lt;a href=\"AS%20Nancy\"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt;, with all three Lyon goals coming from new signings Bastos, L\u00f3pez and Gomis.\nFollowing a long international break, Lyon faced &lt;a href=\"FC%20Lorient\"&gt;Lorient&lt;/a&gt; at home, their first and only back-to-back home league match set. In the match, which was fairly even looking at the statistics, Lyon controlled possession for 57 percent of the match, but did not score a goal until the 72nd following a perfect cross from &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Govou\"&gt;Sidney Govou&lt;/a&gt; into the box, which landed at the head of Michel Bastos and then into the back of the net. Lyon maintained the 1\u20130 lead to win the match moving the club into a tie for second place with title rivals &lt;a href=\"FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;. The following week, Lyon faced rivals &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.\"&gt;Paris Saint-Germain&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Parc%20des%20Princes\"&gt;Parc des Princes&lt;/a&gt; in a match that saw a Lyon side missing several key players. In the 29th minute, the Parisians got a well-deserved goal from former Lyon player &lt;a href=\"Ludovic%20Giuly\"&gt;Ludovic Giuly&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the home side maintaining their attack well into the second half, their first half goal was canceled out following an &lt;a href=\"Aly%20Cissokho\"&gt;Aly Cissokho&lt;/a&gt; cross into the box that saw &lt;a href=\"Baf%C3%A9timbi%20Gomis\"&gt;Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis&lt;/a&gt; get a slight touch on the ball to get it past &lt;a href=\"Gr%C3%A9gory%20Coupet\"&gt;Gr\u00e9gory Coupet&lt;/a&gt;. The goal secured a point for Lyon and also allowed the club to maintain their top 2 position in the table. Lyon contested up-and-comers &lt;a href=\"Toulouse%20FC\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt; the following match day. Lyon defense was again the first to concede allowing a goal from youngster &lt;a href=\"Moussa%20Sissoko\"&gt;Moussa Sissoko&lt;/a&gt; in just the eighth minute. Despite conceding early, however, Lyon's attack was extremely uptempo, which allowed the away side to break into numerous counterattacks. Lyon's attack finally paid off, in the 52nd minute following a goal from &lt;a href=\"Yannis%20Tafer\"&gt;Yannis Tafer&lt;/a&gt;, which was his first professional goal. Tafer, who came on as a half-time substitute, secured the goal following a cross into the box by the dangerous Cissokho. The &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20youth%20football%20team\"&gt;French youth international&lt;/a&gt; ran near post and got a shot off high into the visiting net. With Lyon's confidence high, their attack increased, which led to numerous chances. Eventually, Lyon got a goal from Gomis, his second in two matches to give the club a 2\u20131 victory. The following week, Lyon reached top of the table for the first time this season, courtesy of a 2\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"RC%20Lens\"&gt;Lens&lt;/a&gt;. Despite enduring a hostile crowd and constant pressure from Lens, Lyon and their defense stood tall with Govou and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20K%C3%A4llstr%C3%B6m\"&gt;Kim K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m&lt;/a&gt; getting both goals in the seventh and 78th minute, respectively.\nCoupe de France.\nLyon will enter the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Coupe%20de%20France\"&gt;2009\u201310 Coupe de France season&lt;/a&gt; having won the title just &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Coupe%20de%20France\"&gt;two seasons ago&lt;/a&gt;. Lyon will start from the Round of 64, as all Ligue 1 clubs will. On 14 December 2009, the draw for the Round of 64 was determined and Lyon were giving the task of traveling to &lt;a href=\"Alsace\"&gt;Alsace&lt;/a&gt; to face &lt;a href=\"Ligue%202\"&gt;second division&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"RC%20Strasbourg%20Alsace\"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt;. Lyon's first match of the 2010 winter season was highly anticipated by the media and supporters alike following the team's disastrous ending to 2009 portion of the campaign. Lyon started this game in fantastic fashion scoring two goals in the first 15 minutes with &lt;a href=\"Baf%C3%A9timbi%20Gomis\"&gt;Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis&lt;/a&gt; getting the opener in the 11th minute and Bastos getting one three minutes later. Layon maintained the 2\u20130 until &lt;a href=\"injury%20time\"&gt;injury time&lt;/a&gt; in the first half when &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20Fauvergue\"&gt;Nicolas Fauvergue&lt;/a&gt; netted a goal for his side. Within the first 15 minutes of the second half, Lyon struggled to maintain its first half mentality. Young Strasbourg striker &lt;a href=\"Magaye%20Gueye\"&gt;Magaye Gueye&lt;/a&gt; tested Lloris on two occasions. Eventually, the match was put to bed after 71 minutes following a laser free kick from Bastos giving Lyon a 3\u20131 lead, which was the final result. In the ensuing draw, Lyon were given another tough test, courtesy of fellow Ligue 1 club &lt;a href=\"AS%20Monaco%20FC\"&gt;AS Monaco&lt;/a&gt;. In the Round of 32 clash, Lyon opened the scoring through &lt;a href=\"Jean-Alain%20Boumsong\"&gt;Jean-Alain Boumsong&lt;/a&gt; on the cusp of half-time with a thumping header following a corner kick. After half-time, Monaco's Brazilian striker &lt;a href=\"Nen%C3%AA%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201981%29\"&gt;Nen\u00ea&lt;/a&gt; equalised from the penalty spot seven minutes into the second period after Sidney Govou was adjudged to have fouled him in the penalty area. Despite maintaining consistency throughout the match, Lyon would suffer defeat and elimination from the competition following the conversion of a close-range header by &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Park%20Chu-young\"&gt;Park Chu-young&lt;/a&gt;, following a cross, 13 minutes from time. The goal was partially attributed to goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Hugo%20Lloris\"&gt;Hugo Lloris&lt;/a&gt;' unwillingness to intercept the ball upon realizing a teammate was attempting to clear it himself. The former's unwillingness and the teammate's attempt at a clearance was both futile as Park headed the ball in easily.\nCoupe de la Ligue.\nLyon will enter &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Coupe%20de%20la%20Ligue\"&gt;Coupe de la Ligue season&lt;/a&gt; having last won the cup in &lt;a href=\"Coupe%20de%20la%20Ligue%20Final%202001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Coupe%20de%20la%20Ligue\"&gt;Last season&lt;/a&gt;, they were eliminated in the Round of 16 by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Metz\"&gt;Metz&lt;/a&gt;. Lyon entered the competition during the Round of 16 phase. The draw was determined on 25 September and Lyon were pitted against Metz for the second straight season. Metz defeated Lyon 1\u20133 with goals from &lt;a href=\"Romain%20Rocchi\"&gt;Romain Rocchi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A9bastien%20Renouard\"&gt;S\u00e9bastien Renouard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Mendy\"&gt;Victor Mendy&lt;/a&gt; in last year's competition. Lyon marched into the Round of 16 match initially nervous before taking control of the match with a rare goal from &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%A9my%20Toulalan\"&gt;J\u00e9r\u00e9my Toulalan&lt;/a&gt;, his first as a Lyon player and only the second of his football career. Lyon later got great chances from Michel Bastos and &lt;a href=\"Yannis%20Tafer\"&gt;Yannis Tafer&lt;/a&gt; with the latter actually scoring, however he was determined to bee offsides by the linesman. Though, Metz maintained the 1\u20130 deep into the second half, the match was sealed following a brace from &lt;a href=\"Lisandro%20L%C3%B3pez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29\"&gt;Lisandro L\u00f3pez&lt;/a&gt;, which took only two minutes to complete. In the ensuing draw, held the day after their victory, Lyon were paired with &lt;a href=\"FC%20Lorient\"&gt;Lorient&lt;/a&gt;, whom they will contested on the road at the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20du%20Moustoir\"&gt;Stade du Moustoir&lt;/a&gt; mid-week on 26 January. In the match, Lorient took a firm stance early courtesy of a goal from &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Gameiro\"&gt;Kevin Gameiro&lt;/a&gt; in the fourth minute after the Lorient striker took advantage of a blunder by new signing &lt;a href=\"Dejan%20Lovren\"&gt;Dejan Lovren&lt;/a&gt;. Despite having 86 minutes to either draw the match or win it, Lyon failed to get on the score-sheet despite capable chances from L\u00f3pez, Bastos and Pjani\u0107 on several occasions and thus were eliminated from the competition for the ninth straight season.\nUEFA Champions League.\nPlayoff Round.\nLyon entered the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; for the tenth-straight season. For the first time, however, they had to qualify in order to reach the group stage as they entered through the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Play-off%20round\"&gt;playoff round&lt;/a&gt;, due to their 3rd position finish last season. Clubs Lyon could have possibly encountered in the playoff round included Italian club &lt;a href=\"ACF%20Fiorentina\"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt;, Spanish side &lt;a href=\"Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid\"&gt;Atl\u00e9tico Madrid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt;. The draw was determined on 7 August and Lyon were given &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"R.S.C.%20Anderlecht\"&gt;Anderlecht&lt;/a&gt; as opponents. The first leg was played on 19 August at the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Gerland\"&gt;Stade Gerland&lt;/a&gt;, while the second leg was played a week later at &lt;a href=\"Constant%20Vanden%20Stock%20Stadium\"&gt;Constant Vanden Stock Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Anderlecht\"&gt;Anderlecht&lt;/a&gt;. The winner entered the group stage of the UEFA Champions League.\nIn the opening leg, Lyon, at the onset, quickly forced a strong attacking pace into the game catching an unexpected Belgian side off guard. In just the 8th minute, Lyon were awarded a free kick and it was easily converted by &lt;a href=\"Miralem%20Pjani%C4%87\"&gt;Miralem Pjani\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, his first ever goal with the club. The home side continued their attack forcing the Belgians to hold off their attack and focus more on defending. Despite Anderlecht's intent, in the 14th minute, Lyon were awarded a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt; by referee &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Stark\"&gt;Wolfgang Stark&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Lisandro%20L%C3%B3pez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29\"&gt;Lisandro L\u00f3pez&lt;/a&gt;, on a breakaway, was taken down in the box by Anderlecht &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silvio%20Proto\"&gt;Silvio Proto&lt;/a&gt;. Having won the penalty, L\u00f3pez stepped up to take it and converted giving Lyon a 2\u20130 lead in just 15 minutes of play. Throughout the first half, Lyon continued to control the match, at one point, having 65% of the possession. Their continued attack paid off with an amazing left-footed rocket shot from &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Bastos\"&gt;Michel Bastos&lt;/a&gt; in the 39th minute. Just three minutes later, Lyon converted again through &lt;a href=\"Baf%C3%A9timbi%20Gomis\"&gt;Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis&lt;/a&gt; on an easy shot just in front of goal following a nice pass from L\u00f3pez. The goal gave Lyon a 4\u20130 heading into the halftime. Lyon came out for the second half in completely opposite fashion compared to the first. This allowed Anderlecht to finally get some play on the ball. Just 14 minutes into the second half, Anderlecht got their first goal from the &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mat%C3%ADas%20Su%C3%A1rez\"&gt;Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez&lt;/a&gt;, who beat both &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bodmer\"&gt;Mathieu Bodmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hugo%20Lloris\"&gt;Hugo Lloris&lt;/a&gt; to the ball and eventually pushed it into the back of the net. Just five minutes later, however, Lyon would regain their four-goal lead with Gomis scoring his second of the match following the Belgian goalkeeper Proto's mistake of leaving his net open by attempting to beat the Frenchman to a passing ball from Michel Bastos. Despite numerous chances from substitute &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9sar%20Delgado\"&gt;C\u00e9sar Delgado&lt;/a&gt;, Lyon could not add to their defining lead and headed to &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; with a 5\u20131 aggregate lead.\nIn the second leg, Lyon decided to preserve their 5\u20131 aggregate lead by keeping the pace of the match slow, as well as holding possession as much as possible in order to keep Anderlecht, who were now playing at home, from getting an early goal. Eventually, this strategy paid off resulting in a goal from Lisandro following a rash mistake from an Anderlecht defender who, upon receiving the ball from the goalkeeper, made a pass directly into the path of the Argentine who rightfully intercepted it and easily chipped the ball over the unexpected goalkeeper to give Lyon a 1\u20130 lead and effectively end Anderlecht's chances. Six minutes later, Lisandro scored again, this time due to a great cross from &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20R%C3%A9veill%C3%A8re\"&gt;Anthony R\u00e9veill\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;, who found the striker wide open inside the penalty box. Minutes before halftime, Lisandro scored his first career &lt;a href=\"hat%20trick\"&gt;hat trick&lt;/a&gt; for the club in just his fourth match with them, converting the goal following a turnover from the Anderlecht midfielder &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Pol%C3%A1k\"&gt;Jan Pol\u00e1k&lt;/a&gt;. In the second half, Anderlecht converted from the penalty spot in the 51st minute and the 3\u20131 scoreline eventually remained until the end of the match. The victory allowed Lyon to advance to the group stages on an aggregate score of 8\u20132.\nGroup stage.\nThe draw for the group stage of the Champions League was determined on 27 August 2009. Due to &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;'s victory over &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; in the third qualifying round, Lyon were inserted into Pot 2. Following the draw, Lyon were inserted into Group E with English club &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; from Pot 1, Italian side &lt;a href=\"ACF%20Fiorentina\"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt; from Pot 3, and &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Debreceni%20VSC\"&gt;Debreceni VSC&lt;/a&gt; from Pot 4. Lyon have, previously, never faced Liverpool nor Debreceni in the Champions League, with the latter making their debut in the competition. However, Lyon have faced Fiorentina, whom they contested two matches against during &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage%23Group%20F\"&gt;last year's group stage&lt;/a&gt;. The first match, played at the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Gerland\"&gt;Stade Gerland&lt;/a&gt; finished 2\u20132 in controversial fashion, while the second match away to Fiorentina was won by Lyon 2\u20131.\nLyon started their &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"ACF%20Fiorentina\"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt;. Fiorentina, who played most of the match with 10 men, due to a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20card\"&gt;red card&lt;/a&gt; being given to &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Gilardino\"&gt;Alberto Gilardino&lt;/a&gt; held on to a 0\u20130 draw until the 76th minute when the &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnian&lt;/a&gt; midfielder &lt;a href=\"Miralem%20Pjani%C4%87\"&gt;Miralem Pjani\u0107&lt;/a&gt; scored the opening goal and winning goal. The following match day, the club faced minnows &lt;a href=\"Debreceni%20VSC\"&gt;Debrecen&lt;/a&gt; and came out with a 4\u20130. In the match, Lyon dominated the first half scoring three of their four goals in the first 25 minutes with &lt;a href=\"Kim%20K%C3%A4llstr%C3%B6m\"&gt;Kim K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m&lt;/a&gt;, Pjani\u0107, and &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Govou\"&gt;Sidney Govou&lt;/a&gt; getting on the scoresheet. &lt;a href=\"Baf%C3%A9timbi%20Gomis\"&gt;Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis&lt;/a&gt; capped the night scoring the final goal in the second half. \nOn 20 October Lyon began their back-to-back matches against &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; with the first match being played at the historic &lt;a href=\"Anfield\"&gt;Anfield&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Lyon attacking early on, it was Liverpool who got scored first with &lt;a href=\"Yossi%20Benayoun\"&gt;Yossi Benayoun&lt;/a&gt; converting. In the 33rd minute, Lyon's lone healthy centre back &lt;a href=\"Cris%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201977%29\"&gt;Cris&lt;/a&gt; suffered a concussion and was taken off the field before half-time, despite an attempt to continue playing. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"defensive%20midfielder\"&gt;defensive midfielder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maxime%20Gonalons\"&gt;Maxime Gonalons&lt;/a&gt;. Due to this, Lyon employed a more defensive style earlier in the second half, but eventually garnered enough confidence to get forward and in the 72nd minute, it paid off. Following a corner kick from K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m, Lyon got two chances at goal from &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%A9my%20Toulalan\"&gt;J\u00e9r\u00e9my Toulalan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Makoun\"&gt;Jean Makoun&lt;/a&gt; before the ball was headed in by the substitute Gonalons. The goal drew the match at 1\u20131 and Lyon later won the match in &lt;a href=\"injury%20time\"&gt;injury time&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9sar%20Delgado\"&gt;C\u00e9sar Delgado&lt;/a&gt; scoring the game-winning goal. The victory was Lyon's first victory over an English club in the Champions League. In the return leg, Lyon managed a 1\u20131 draw, primarily due to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hugo%20Lloris\"&gt;Hugo Lloris&lt;/a&gt; who performed admirably producing sharp stops from &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Torres\"&gt;Fernando Torres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dirk%20Kuyt\"&gt;Dirk Kuyt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Andriy%20Voronin\"&gt;Andriy Voronin&lt;/a&gt; in the first half, then displaying stunning reflexes to deny the Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Lucas%20Leiva\"&gt;Lucas&lt;/a&gt; midway through the second period. Though Lyon conceded late following an amazing goal from &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Babel\"&gt;Ryan Babel&lt;/a&gt;, they drew the match 1\u20131 with a goal from &lt;a href=\"Lisandro%20L%C3%B3pez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29\"&gt;Lisandro L\u00f3pez&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"injury%20time\"&gt;injury time&lt;/a&gt;. The point brought Lyon's total tally to ten and assured the club a spot in &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20stage\"&gt;the knockout stage&lt;/a&gt;.\nLyon's effort to go into the knockout stage in first place were put into danger following their 0\u20131 defeat to Fiorentina at the &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Artemio%20Franchi\"&gt;Stadio Artemio Franchi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;. Lyon contested the match missing several key players, notably starters &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%A9my%20Toulalan\"&gt;J\u00e9r\u00e9my Toulalan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20R%C3%A9veill%C3%A8re\"&gt;Anthony R\u00e9veill\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;. Despite outshooting and holding 57% of the possession, Lyon failed to get on the score-sheet and conceded from the penalty spot after referee &lt;a href=\"Oleg%C3%A1rio%20Benqueren%C3%A7a\"&gt;Oleg\u00e1rio Benqueren\u00e7a&lt;/a&gt; ruled that Aly Cissokho had committed a foul on &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Marchionni\"&gt;Marco Marchionni&lt;/a&gt; inside of the box. The penalty was converted sublimely by &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Manuel%20Vargas\"&gt;Juan Manuel Vargas&lt;/a&gt;. The loss moved Fiorentina into the first place and ultimately the battle for top spot in the group was decided on the final day. Lyon faced Debrecen and like the first match, Lyon attacked early and by the end of the first half led 2\u20130 with goals from Bastos and Gomis. In the second half, Lyon increased their performance getting a free kick goal from Pjani\u0107 and also one from Cissokho, which was his first professional goal. During the final minutes of the match, Lyon's support was high and ecstatic, mainly due to the Liverpool\u2013Fiorentina match being drawn at that point, their hearts were broken following a goal from &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Gilardino\"&gt;Alberto Gilardino&lt;/a&gt; in injury time to give Fiorentina a 2\u20131 victory and top spot in the group. The 4\u20130 thrashing of Debrecen was deemed futile.\nFirst Knockout Round.\nFor the seventh straight season, Lyon reached the first knockout round. Due to finishing second, Lyon faced the danger of being paired with several big clubs that finished first in other groups. Notable clubs Lyon could have been paired with include &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; to name a few. Following the draw, held on 18 December 2009, Lyon indeed received a tough draw being given &lt;a href=\"La%20Liga\"&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;. The draw meant that former Lyon player &lt;a href=\"Karim%20Benzema\"&gt;Karim Benzema&lt;/a&gt; returned to the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20de%20Gerland\"&gt;Stade de Gerland&lt;/a&gt; after leaving the club only six months prior. This was the second straight season Lyon faced a Spanish club in the first knockout round having lost 3\u20136 on aggregate to Barcelona in last season's competition. The first leg was played at the Gerland on 16 February 2010, while the second leg was held at the &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium\"&gt;Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on 10 March.\nQuarter-finals.\nFollowing their successful 2\u20131 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, Lyon were inserted into the quarter-finals. The draw was conducted on 19 March and Lyon were drawn to face &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;Ligue 1&lt;/a&gt; rivals and fellow French club &lt;a href=\"FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;. On 30 March 2010, Lyon faced Bordeaux at the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20de%20Gerland\"&gt;Stade de Gerland&lt;/a&gt; in the first leg of the competition. Lyon got on the scoreboard early through a goal through Lisandro L\u00f3pez following a blunder from Bordeaux defender &lt;a href=\"Micha%C3%ABl%20Ciani\"&gt;Micha\u00ebl Ciani&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bodmer\"&gt;Mathieu Bodmer&lt;/a&gt; to recover the ball inside the box and find L\u00f3pez in front of goal. Undeterred, Bordeaux quickly leveled with a vital away goal from &lt;a href=\"Striker%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;striker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marouane%20Chamakh\"&gt;Marouane Chamakh&lt;/a&gt; after great service from &lt;a href=\"Yoann%20Gourcuff\"&gt;Yoann Gourcuff&lt;/a&gt;. In the 32nd minute, Lyon again took the lead with Michel Bastos scoring following another Bordeaux error, this time from &lt;a href=\"Beno%C3%AEt%20Tr%C3%A9moulinas\"&gt;Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9moulinas&lt;/a&gt; who misplayed a Lyon cross, which allowed the ball to land at the feet of Bastos who proceeded to blast a shot past goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9dric%20Carrasso\"&gt;C\u00e9dric Carrasso&lt;/a&gt;. Midway through the second half, &lt;a href=\"Laurent%20Blanc\"&gt;Laurent Blanc&lt;/a&gt;'s team rallied with the Brazilian Wendel drilling a shot on goal, which went by Hugo Lloris, but went directly off the post. Minutes later, Lyon were awarded a penalty courtesy of a &lt;a href=\"Matthieu%20Chalm%C3%A9\"&gt;Matthieu Chalm\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; handball. The penalty was converted by Lisandro to give Lyon a 3\u20131 lead and the Argentine was later carded in the final minutes of the match, which resulted in him missing the second leg. The 3\u20131 scoreline remained ensuring Lyon a wonderful opportunity to reach their first ever UEFA Champions League semi-final.\nIn the second leg in &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;, Claude Puel opted for a more defensive formation starting Maxime Gonalons ahead of the attack-minded Miralem Pjani\u0107. The strategy was successful during the early stages but turned sour following an accurate shot from midfielder &lt;a href=\"Alou%20Diarra\"&gt;Alou Diarra&lt;/a&gt;, which again beat Lloris, but, for the second straight match, hit the post in the 43rd minute. Two minutes later, just before halftime, Bordeaux drew within one goal following a conversion from Chamakh. In the second half, Puel remained confident in defense opting to substitute out attacker and lone striker Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis in order to clog the midfield. In the final stages of the match, Bordeaux were near the &lt;a href=\"game-winning%20goal\"&gt;game-winning goal&lt;/a&gt; following a header attempt by Wendel, but their hopes were spoiled following an amazing save from Lloris. Though Bordeaux were successful in attaining a victory, the 3\u20132 aggregate scoreline was in Lyon's favor allowing the club to advance to their first-ever UEFA Champions League semi-final.\nSemi-finals.\nLyon will be making their first-ever UEFA Champions League semi-final appearance following their 3\u20132 aggregate victory over French rivals Bordeaux. Following the quarter-final draw, the winner of the match were pitted to either face English club &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; or German club &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 April 2010, Bayern Munich lost to Manchester United 3\u20132 at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;, but their 2\u20131 result in the previous leg in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; allowed Bayern to advance to the semi-finals to face Lyon on the away goals rule.\nLyon and Bayern Munich have met recently.
