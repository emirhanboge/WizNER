In 2020, the &lt;a href=\"Budapest%20Business%20School%20Faculty%20of%20Finance%20and%20Accountancy\"&gt;Faculty of Finance and Accountancy&lt;/a&gt; finished first on the university faculty popularity list in Hungary, and the other two, the Faculty of Commerce, Hospitality and Tourism and the Faculty of International Management and Business were also among the 10 most popular Hungarian university faculties.\nHistory and traditions.\nBudapest Business School was founded as the Pest Academy of Commerce that was established in 1857, which is the official predecessor of the BBS faculties College of Finance and Accountancy and the College of Catering, Commerce and Tourism. Pest Academy of Commerce (German: Pester Handelsakademie, Hungarian: Pesti Kereskedelmi Akad\u00e9mia) was founded by the second president of the Pest Chamber of Commerce, J\u00f3zsef Appiano, Antal Valero (first president of the Pest Chamber of Commerce, and later Pest Mayor) and by Habsburg Emperor &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Joseph%20I%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Francis Joseph&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning, the language of education was German at the academy.\nIt was the first higher educational institution for &lt;a href=\"business%20studies\"&gt;business studies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, thus it was the first &lt;a href=\"business%20school\"&gt;business school&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central Europe&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, it is the oldest existing &lt;a href=\"business%20school\"&gt;business school&lt;/a&gt; in the world, following the &lt;a href=\"ESCP%20Europe\"&gt;ESCP Europe&lt;/a&gt; with its campuses in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torino\"&gt;Torino&lt;/a&gt;. After the cities Buda and Pest merged, the institution was renamed to Budapest Academy of Commerce. Most of the business professionals and economists of the country gained their qualifications there as it was the only business school in the country that time.\nArchitect &lt;a href=\"Gy%C5%91z%C5%91%20Czigler\"&gt;Gy\u0151z\u0151 Czigler&lt;/a&gt; designed the Alkom\u00e1ny street campus of the Budapest Academy of Commerce in 1882, and the construction was finished in 1885, when the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Parliament%20Building\"&gt;Hungarian Parliament Building&lt;/a&gt; was also starting directly next to it. He was the architect of the &lt;a href=\"Sz%C3%A9chenyi%20thermal%20bath\"&gt;Sz\u00e9chenyi thermal bath&lt;/a&gt; and many other famous buildings. The campus at the Alkotm\u00e1ny street is still one of the main campuses of the Budapest Business School. BBS's campus at the Mark\u00f3 street is also located in Downtown Budapest. It is also a monumental building, designed by famous architect Ferenc Kolbenheyer (father of &lt;a href=\"Erwin%20Guido%20Kolbenheyer\"&gt;Erwin Guido Kolbenheyer&lt;/a&gt;) in neoclassical style in 1872. The Mark\u00f3 street campus of the Budapest Business School is a close but more modest kin of the top-ranked &lt;a href=\"ETH%20Zurich\"&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/a&gt;, designed by &lt;a href=\"Gottfried%20Semper\"&gt;Gottfried Semper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Zeuner\"&gt;Gustav Zeuner&lt;/a&gt;. There is a famous Council Room at the Mark\u00f3 street campus called Lotz Room, full with paintings painted by &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A1roly%20Lotz\"&gt;K\u00e1roly Lotz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B3r%20Than\"&gt;M\u00f3r Than&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the conferences of the Hungarian &lt;a href=\"Presidency%20of%20the%20Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;Presidency of the Council of the European Union&lt;/a&gt; was held in this room, and in other lecture rooms of the Mark\u00f3 street campus. Budapest Academy of Commerce was a private business school until 1949, when it was secularized by the government, becoming a public business school.\nAfter the school was renamed and changed several times, the College of Accountancy was established in 1953, and the College of Catering and Commerce was established in 1969. The forerunner of the College of International Management is the School of International Commerce that was established in 1957.\nIn January 2000, the colleges created the Budapest Business School and became faculties of the university.\nAcademic profile.\nThe University has teaching and education, research and related organisational units, performing service, administrative, organisational and management tasks. The Academic Organisation and the Chancellery, as two pillars, form the main organisational units that ensure the sustainability and realisation of the university's goals. The Academic Organisation participates in the supervision of the basic activities of education and research, in the creation of the relevant strategy, and also supervises the management of all educational, research and public education institutions outside the faculty organisations. Current educational, academic and research departments are the following:\nAt the university can be chosen from 10 BA/BSc programs during the admission process in English:\nThere are currently 9 MA/MSc programs available at BBS:\nBBS Doctoral School of Entrepreneurship and Business focuses on businesses and their development.

The Centres of Excellence are dominant in Hungary in their field of professional activity, they play an important role in the relationship between higher education and companies, and they also carry out high-quality applied scientific research relevant to practice with the involvement of corporate partners and students.

An important task for BBS is to disseminate professional knowledge and shape social attitudes.\nThe scientific activities of the BBS are managed by the Vice-Rector for Research, who is supported by the Vice Deans for Research of the Faculty. The Vice-Rector may rely on the Scientific Council and the Research Society to discuss scientific issues and make decisions on scientific matters. The lecturers of BBS evaluate the outstanding scientific achievement with the BBS Scientific Prize, which is announced annually and presented in the framework of the Hungarian Science Festival conference series. We also give special recognition - the Excellent Mentoring Award - to professors who excellence based on the results of the Students\u2019 Research Societies activity.\nAt the BBS Centre for Research Services, offered support for high-level and applied research as well as research-based projects related to student talent promotion and teaching methodology.
