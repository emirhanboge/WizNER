    "text": "The yellow tyrannulet (\"Capsiempis flaveola\") is a very small &lt;a href=\"passerine\"&gt;passerine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"tyrant%20flycatcher\"&gt;tyrant flycatcher&lt;/a&gt; family. It breeds from Nicaragua south to northeastern Argentina and southeastern Brazil. It is the only member of the genus Capsiempis, but its taxonomy is uncertain, and it has been allocated to at least three other genera in the past.\nThis species is found in thickets, forest and streamside edges, dense second growth, and bushy pastures or clearings. The cup nest is made of plant fibre and grass blades, decorated outside with moss. It is placed 2\u20137 m high in a tree, shrub, or &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; plant. The typical clutch is two white eggs, usually umarked or with very light rufous speckles.\nDescription.\nThe yellow tyrannulet is 10.5-11.4\u00a0cm long, weighs 8 g, and with its slender build and small bill resembles a tiny &lt;a href=\"vireo\"&gt;vireo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"New%20World%20warbler\"&gt;warbler&lt;/a&gt;. Its upperparts are olive-green and the underparts are bright yellow. The head has whitish or pale yellow &lt;a href=\"supercilium\"&gt;supercilia&lt;/a&gt;. The wings and tail are dusky brown with weak yellow feather-edging, and there are two yellowish wing bars. Sexes are similar, but young birds are browner above and paler yellow below. The call is a soft ' and the duetted song is a rhythmic '. There is some geographical variation in both appearance and vocalisation.\nDiet.\nYellow tyrannulets are active birds, seen in pairs or family groups feeding on &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s and small &lt;a href=\"berry\"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;. The prey is &lt;a href=\"Gleaning%20%28birds%29\"&gt;gleaned&lt;/a&gt; from foliage or taken in short sallies."
