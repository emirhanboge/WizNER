    "text": "James D. Monihon (November 6, 1837September 2, 1904) was an American businessman and politician. He was a signatory to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20River%20Valley%20Town%20Association\"&gt;Salt River Valley Town Association&lt;/a&gt;, the first government of the area that became &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, and later served on the board of supervisors and as mayor of Phoenix.\nEarly years, mining, military service.\nMonihon was born to James and Ann (Martin) Monaghan, Irish immigrants, in &lt;a href=\"Oneida%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Oneida County, New York&lt;/a&gt; on November 6, 1837. When he was two, his family moved to &lt;a href=\"St.%20Lawrence%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;St. Lawrence County&lt;/a&gt; where he grew up on a farm and attended local schools. Monihon joined the &lt;a href=\"California%20Gold%20Rush\"&gt;California Gold Rush&lt;/a&gt; in 1854, traveling by sea via the &lt;a href=\"Isthmus%20of%20Panama\"&gt;Isthmus of Panama&lt;/a&gt;. After reaching &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2C%20California\"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt;, he became involved in &lt;a href=\"placer%20mining\"&gt;placer mining&lt;/a&gt; often around &lt;a href=\"Howland%20Flat\"&gt;Howland Flat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;Sierra County&lt;/a&gt; until 1861.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, Monihon enlisted in Company F of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20California%20Infantry%20Regiment\"&gt;1st California Infantry Regiment&lt;/a&gt;. While in the military, he served throughout the area that composes modern day &lt;a href=\"Arizona\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. As Chief of the Howitzer division he fired a celebratory salute in &lt;a href=\"Tucson%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt; on July 4, 1862. Ten days later he saw action during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Apache%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Apache Pass&lt;/a&gt; when his unit of 64 soldiers was attacked by over 450 &lt;a href=\"Apache%20Indians\"&gt;Apache Indians&lt;/a&gt; led by chief &lt;a href=\"Cochise\"&gt;Cochise&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the battle, his unit spent two months in &lt;a href=\"Mesilla%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Mesilla&lt;/a&gt; before being redeployed to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Craig\"&gt;Fort Craig&lt;/a&gt;. In late 1863, Monihon's unit was ordered to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Wingate\"&gt;Fort Wingate&lt;/a&gt;. From there they continued to the &lt;a href=\"Chino%20Valley%20%28Arizona%29\"&gt;Chino valley&lt;/a&gt; where they established &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Whipple%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Fort Whipple&lt;/a&gt;. Monihon served as &lt;a href=\"Provost%20Sergeant\"&gt;Provost Sergeant&lt;/a&gt; at his new posting until his &lt;a href=\"Military%20discharge\"&gt;discharge&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the war.\nHe remained in central Arizona, where he worked in mining again for several years and ran a &lt;a href=\"livery%20stable\"&gt;livery stable&lt;/a&gt; in Prescott. Much of his mining work was as engineer of the mill at the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bug%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Big Bug mine&lt;/a&gt;. In 1868, Monihon sold the livery business, the Plaza Feed and Livery Stable, to &lt;a href=\"Gideon%20Brooke\"&gt;Gideon Brooke&lt;/a&gt; and Jacob Linn.\n&lt;a href=\"George%20M.%20Willing\"&gt;George M. Willing&lt;/a&gt; tried to sell him half ownership in the fraudulent &lt;a href=\"Peralta%20land%20grant\"&gt;Peralta land grant&lt;/a&gt; for $250 in 1867. Willing suggested that the two of them could reap a sizable profit by selling nearby mines back to their owners. Monihon was incensed by the offer and rebuffed Willing who quickly left town. Almost 30 years later, Monihon testified as a principal witness for the government about this in court after the fraud was exposed. Monihon relocated to &lt;a href=\"Wickenburg\"&gt;Wickenburg&lt;/a&gt; and in March 1869, opened the Wickenburg Feed and Sale Stable.\nPhoenix.\nA year later, he was in &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; where he built what is claimed to be Phoenix's second house. He was one of the first builders in the area, using &lt;a href=\"adobe\"&gt;adobe&lt;/a&gt; techniques suited for the available materials.\nIn 1870, he was a signatory to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20River%20Valley%20Town%20Association\"&gt;Salt River Valley Town Association&lt;/a&gt;, the first government of the area that became Phoenix. On January 17, 1871, he planted the first &lt;a href=\"Populus%20fremontii\"&gt;Cottonwood tree&lt;/a&gt; in the town.\nHe partnered with Captain Hancock in 1871 to erect the first &lt;a href=\"Maricopa%20County%20Courthouse\"&gt;Maricopa County Courthouse&lt;/a&gt; which they rented to the county as the seat of the county government. The city's first public school was located there and the first District Court for Maricopa County held its initial session in the building which also acted as the civic center of the city. When the county moved out in 1875, the building was used as a Justice of the Peace office for many years.\nIn May 1872, he built a barn and corral for the Starar Brothers, from which they ran the Phoenix Livery, Feed, and Sales Stables on the corner of Washington Street and First Avenue. Monihon was paid with a one-third ownership interest in the business. At some point, Monihon bought out his partners and became sole owner. He operated the business for ten years.\nHe was on the board of supervisors in 1874, and was nominated to run in the first mayoral election as the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; candidate after Phoenix was incorporated in 1881. He lost by seven votes but was elected councilman the next year.\nHe left Phoenix for a period of six years but returned from the &lt;a href=\"eastern%20United%20States\"&gt;east&lt;/a&gt; in 1889 and became chairman of the board of directors of the &lt;a href=\"insane%20asylum\"&gt;Insane Asylum of Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; which had opened two years earlier.\nThe next year, he built a large building on part of the stable grounds. The Monihon building was at the time considered \"the finest edifice in Arizona\". It was torn down in the mid-1930s.\nMayor.\nHe ran for Phoenix mayor a second time in 1892, being unanimously nominated at the Republican city convention, and was again defeated, this time losing 268 to 198. Monihon continued to be active in the party, and organized \"the greatest political gathering in the territory\", a rally of the Republican party in Maricopa County in September 1892. He was victorious in his third run in May 1894, winning by a large majority of 388 to 234 and leading a Republican sweep of all positions in the city election. He failed to win the Republican nomination in 1895 to Pierce Evans who lost the election to the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; candidate. Monihon regained the Republican nomination and won the next election in June, 1896 by a vote of 268 to 238. He received the party nomination again in 1899, but not the endorsement of the \"Arizona Republican\", which endorsed every other Republican on the ticket for city offices. He lost the election.\nAs mayor, he spoke at a ceremony marking the completion of the &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%2C%20Prescott%20and%20Phoenix%20Railway\"&gt;Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway&lt;/a&gt; in March 1895 and presented a gold key to the Vice President of the railroad in appreciation for connecting Phoenix with the &lt;a href=\"Atchison%2C%20Topeka%20and%20Santa%20Fe%20Railway\"&gt;Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway&lt;/a&gt; network via Prescott and on to the mainline at &lt;a href=\"Prescott%20Junction\"&gt;Prescott Junction&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nMonihon married Josie C. Linville of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Rosa%2C%20California\"&gt;Santa Rosa, California&lt;/a&gt; on March 15, 1877. The union produced one daughter, Rebecca Ann.\nHe was a charter member of Phoenix Engine Company #1, Phoenix's first volunteer fire department that was formed in 1886 and was a bucket brigade captain and has been called the \"father\" of the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Fire%20Department\"&gt;Phoenix Fire Department&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganizations.\nMonihon had an extensive association with &lt;a href=\"Freemasonry\"&gt;Masonry&lt;/a&gt;, being a member of the lodge, chapter, commandery, and Mystic Shrine. He served for three terms as grand marshal of the Grand Lodge. He was a member and commander of the Civil War veterans' fraternal organization, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic\"&gt;Grand Army of the Republic&lt;/a&gt; lodge and was a delegate to the 1889 \"National Encampment\" in &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nMonihon died in his home September 2, 1904, in Phoenix."
