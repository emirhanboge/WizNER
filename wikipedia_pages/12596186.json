    "text": "I Need Drugs is the debut &lt;a href=\"studio%20album\"&gt;studio album&lt;/a&gt; by the American rapper &lt;a href=\"Necro%20%28rapper%29\"&gt;Necro&lt;/a&gt;, released on November 7, 2000 by &lt;a href=\"Psycho%2BLogical-Records\"&gt;Psycho+Logical-Records&lt;/a&gt;. This album maintains emphasis on both his &lt;a href=\"violence\"&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sex\"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; themes, rather than focusing on one or the other such as in his 2001 album \"&lt;a href=\"Gory%20Days\"&gt;Gory Days&lt;/a&gt;\" and his 2005 album \"The Sexorcist\", respectively. The album spawned one single, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Most%20Sadistic\"&gt;The Most Sadistic&lt;/a&gt;\", and a music video for the title track.\nContents.\nThe album contains 13 studio tracks and three &lt;a href=\"radio\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Freestyle%20rap\"&gt;freestyles&lt;/a&gt;. Seven of the studio tracks from the album were previously released on the \"Get on Your Knees\" single and the \"Necro\" &lt;a href=\"Extended%20play\"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt;. Featured guests on the album include Necro's brother &lt;a href=\"Ill%20Bill\"&gt;Ill Bill&lt;/a&gt; and Mr. Hyde.\n\"I Need Drugs\" contains many Necro classics, all of which showcase notable styles Necro refers to as \"&lt;a href=\"Graphic%20violence\"&gt;gore&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Your Fuckin' Head Split\"), \"&lt;a href=\"sex\"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Get on Your Knees\") and \"violence\" (\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Most%20Sadistic\"&gt;The Most Sadistic&lt;/a&gt;\").\nA controversial music video was made for \"I Need Drugs\", which depicts Necro's uncle and his uncle's friend &lt;a href=\"Injection%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;shooting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"smoking\"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"crack%20cocaine\"&gt;crack cocaine&lt;/a&gt; while Necro performs the song. A still image of his uncle also appears as the cover art for the album.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Most%20Sadistic\"&gt;The Most Sadistic&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Fuck You to the Track\" were subsequently remixed since this release, in 2003 for \"Rare Demos and Freestyles Volume 1\" and 2005 for \"Rare Demos and Freestyles Vol. 2\" respectively. An alternate mix of \"Rugged Shit\" was also released in 2003 on \"Rare Demos &amp; Freestyles Vol. 3\".\nThe track \"Your Fucking Head Split\" contains a sample from the &lt;a href=\"soundtrack\"&gt;soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Amazing%20Spider-Man%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe track \"Cockroaches\" contains a sample from the 1983 film \"&lt;a href=\"Scarface%20%281983%20film%29\"&gt;Scarface&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThe song \"Your Fuckin' Head Split\" was featured in the 2011 movie &lt;a href=\"Goon%20%28film%29\"&gt;Goon&lt;/a&gt;.\nReception.\nIn 2009, \"&lt;a href=\"Fangoria\"&gt;Fangoria&lt;/a&gt;\" named it as an iconic &lt;a href=\"horrorcore\"&gt;horrorcore&lt;/a&gt; album.\n&lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; ran a review by critic Jon Azpiri panning the album. He stated that \"the album's unwavering desire to shock us is what makes it so boring\" and that \"the production is remarkably bland.\""
