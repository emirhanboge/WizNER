    "text": "Henryk W\u0142adys\u0142aw Magnuski (January 30, 1909 \u2013 May 4, 1978) was a Polish telecommunications engineer who worked for &lt;a href=\"Motorola\"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. He was a primary contributor in the development of one of the first &lt;a href=\"Walkie-Talkie\"&gt;Walkie-Talkie&lt;/a&gt; radios, the Motorola &lt;a href=\"SCR-300\"&gt;SCR-300&lt;/a&gt;, and influenced the company's success in the field of radio communication.\nEarly years.\nMagnuski was born on January 30, 1909, in &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;. Having lost both parents at a relatively early age, he supported himself and his sister, Janina, by fixing and installing radios for the Polish military. He received his degree from &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20University%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Warsaw University of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in 1934 and started working for the \"State Tele and Radiotechnical Works\" (\"Pa\u0144stwowe Zak\u0142ady Tele i Radiotechniczne\") in &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn June 1939 he was sent by his company to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; in order to study the latest American projects of radio transmitters. Soon after his arrival to the United States, Poland was invaded by Germany and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; broke out. His return home became impossible.\nMotorola.\nIn 1940 he started working for the &lt;a href=\"Galvin%20Manufacturing%20Corporation\"&gt;Galvin Manufacturing Corporation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; (the company changed the name in 1947 to &lt;a href=\"Motorola\"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;) and assigned to a team that developed the &lt;a href=\"SCR-300\"&gt;SCR-300&lt;/a&gt;, the first radio used by American forces in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; to be called a \"&lt;a href=\"Walkie-Talkie\"&gt;Walkie-Talkie&lt;/a&gt;\". As principal RF engineer on the project and named on three patents for the device, Magnuski is sometimes credited as having \"invented the Walkie-Talkie in America\". He later received a U. S. Navy Certificate of Commendation for Outstanding Service for development of the AN/CPN-6 Radar Beacon, a &lt;a href=\"microwave\"&gt;microwave&lt;/a&gt; device which aided &lt;a href=\"Aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;carrier&lt;/a&gt; pilots to find their ship during low visibility conditions.\nAfter the war he did not return to the &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;People's Republic of Poland&lt;/a&gt; and stayed in the USA. He helped in the development of &lt;a href=\"VHF\"&gt;VHF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cavity%20resonator\"&gt;cavity resonator&lt;/a&gt;s that allowed adjacent channel operation, was a key designer for the Motorola Sensicon receiver which used a selective filter in front of the IF &lt;a href=\"amplifier\"&gt;amplifier&lt;/a&gt; and created microwave relay equipment for use in transmitting multi-channel telephone, data and TV. In Motorola's Government Electronics Division he developed the SSB Radio Central Concept AN/USC-3, Motorola\u2019s RADEM system (RADAS), the Deltaplex I digital troposcatter system and lightweight tropo equipment AN/TRC-105.\nRetirement.\nAt retirement after 30 years of cooperation with the company, he was the Associate Director of Research for Motorola's Government Electronics Division, had 30 patents related to VHF and microwave communications, was an &lt;a href=\"IEEE\"&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; Fellow and author of numerous technical papers and a chapter in the \"Communication System Engineering Handbook\".\nHe succumbed to cancer at his home in &lt;a href=\"Glenview%2C%20Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Glenview, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; on May 4, 1978.\nThe Henry Magnuski Electrical and Computer Engineering professorship at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana-Champaign\"&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/a&gt; is named in his honor.\nOn October 6, 2006, Henryk Magnuski was one of the first five inductees into the Illinois Engineering Hall of Fame.\nPolish TVP aired a documentary on the life of Henryk Magnuski on January 27, 2021. It was the first in a series of documentaries on famous Polish scientists and inventors.\nPersonal life.\nMagnuski's son is &lt;a href=\"Hank%20Magnuski\"&gt;Hank Magnuski&lt;/a&gt;, pioneer of PC-to-fax technology."
