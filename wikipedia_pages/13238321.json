    "text": "Claude Elliott Corbitt (July 21, 1915 \u2013 May 1, 1978) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"baseball%20player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"infielder\"&gt;infielder&lt;/a&gt; who appeared in 215 &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; over four seasons for the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Dodgers\"&gt;Brooklyn Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; (1945) and the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; (1946; 1948\u20131949). The native of &lt;a href=\"Sunbury%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Sunbury, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, attended &lt;a href=\"Duke%20University\"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt;. He threw and batted &lt;a href=\"right-handed\"&gt;right-handed&lt;/a&gt;, stood tall and weighed .\nCorbitt's professional career began in &lt;a href=\"minor%20league%20baseball\"&gt;minor league baseball&lt;/a&gt; in 1937, and was interrupted by almost four full seasons of military service with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Force\"&gt;United States Army Air Force&lt;/a&gt; during World War II. He joined the military in January 1942, was commissioned a &lt;a href=\"First%20lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, and earned his wings. He was discharged late in the Major League season, but was able to make his big-league debut, at age 30, on September 23 as a defensive replacement for Dodger &lt;a href=\"third%20baseman\"&gt;third baseman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Augie%20Galan\"&gt;Augie Galan&lt;/a&gt;. Seven days later, he started at third base against the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"single%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;singled&lt;/a&gt; twice against &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Mulcahy\"&gt;Hugh Mulcahy&lt;/a&gt; in the season's final game.\nOn March 18, 1946, the Dodgers sold his contract to Cincinnati, and Corbitt spent the remainder of his MLB career with the Reds, including the full seasons of and . In &lt;a href=\"1946%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season\"&gt;1946&lt;/a&gt;, Corbitt nearly split the Reds' &lt;a href=\"shortstop\"&gt;shortstop&lt;/a&gt; job with &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Miller%20%28infielder%29\"&gt;Eddie Miller&lt;/a&gt;, starting 69 games to Miller's 86. But Corbitt &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batted&lt;/a&gt; only .248 and spent all of 1947 with the &lt;a href=\"Triple-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Triple-A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Syracuse%20Chiefs\"&gt;Syracuse Chiefs&lt;/a&gt;. He won a roster spot with the &lt;a href=\"1948%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season\"&gt;1948 Reds&lt;/a&gt;, however, and was one of four players who shared the &lt;a href=\"second%20baseman\"&gt;second base&lt;/a&gt; job that year. Corbitt started 45 games at second (behind &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Adams\"&gt;Bobby Adams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benny%20Zientara\"&gt;Benny Zientara&lt;/a&gt;), and batted .256. In 1949, his final season in the Majors, Corbitt got into 44 games for Cincinnati, starting 25 defensively, but hit only .181 and spent part of the year with Triple-A Syracuse.\nAll told, Corbitt registered 153 &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; in the Major Leagues, including 22 &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubles&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"triple%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;triple&lt;/a&gt;. His lone &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;, a solo blast, came September 13, 1946, off &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Gee\"&gt;Johnny Gee&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorbitt retired after the 1953 minor league season and died in Cincinnati on May 1, 1978 at the age of 62."
