    "text": "A\u0107im \u010cumi\u0107 (; 1836 \u2013 27 July 1901) was a Serbian &lt;a href=\"jurist\"&gt;jurist&lt;/a&gt; and politician who served as &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Principality of Serbia&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nA\u0107im \u010cumi\u0107 studied and completed his law degree at the universities in &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg\"&gt;Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. He worked as a high school professor, then in court. He was appointed Professor of Criminal Law at the &lt;a href=\"Grandes%20%C3%A9coles\"&gt;Grandes \u00e9coles&lt;/a&gt; (\"Velika \u0161kola\") in 1865. He participated in the work of the Constitutional Committee of 1868 and was noted for his eloquence and for suggesting that the government was to be placed under the control of the State Council, and not the Assembly.\nHe was a politician of &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; orientation, sharing similar beliefs with older politicians such as &lt;a href=\"Ilija%20Gara%C5%A1anin\"&gt;Ilija Gara\u0161anin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jovan%20Marinovi%C4%87\"&gt;Jovan Marinovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. He was the leader of a group of young conservatives.\nIn 1871, he became president of the &lt;a href=\"Belgrade\"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; municipality but was soon overthrown by the Liberal deputy, headed by &lt;a href=\"Jovan%20Risti%C4%87\"&gt;Jovan Risti\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. He then opened his law practice in &lt;a href=\"Belgrade\"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;, and from 1873 to 1874, he was &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20the%20Interior\"&gt;Minister of the Interior&lt;/a&gt; in Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Jovan%20Marinovi%C4%87\"&gt;Marinovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;'s cabinet.\nOn 25 November 1874, \u010cumi\u0107 replaced Marinovi\u0107, who resigned, and became &lt;a href=\"prime%20minister\"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt; himself. As the government did not enjoy the confidence of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20%28Serbia%29\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, \u010cumi\u0107 was replaced after another three months, on 22 January 1875. He was then appointed Judge of the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Cassation%20%28Serbia%29\"&gt;Court of Cassation&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was arrested by the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Serbia%29\"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; government in 1878 for alleged involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Topola\"&gt;Topola&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Topola%20Mutiny\"&gt;Mutiny&lt;/a&gt; and was sentenced to death together with Jevrem Markovi\u0107 and Ilija Milosavljevi\u0107 Kolarac. He was later pardoned and received a commuted sentence of 10 years in prison instead. Markovi\u0107 was the only one executed. \u010cumi\u0107 and Kolarac were released from prison after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Jovan%20Risti%C4%87\"&gt;Risti\u0107&lt;/a&gt; government in 1880. Later, \u010cumi\u0107 ceased his engaging in politics.\nDuring the 1880s he was a government representative ('commissioner') of the Serbian Railways Construction and Exploitation organization. He was very involved in raising the &lt;a href=\"Ilija%20M.%20Kolarac%20Endowment\"&gt;Ilija M. Kolarac Endowment&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was a member of the Serbian Learned Society and an honorary member of the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Royal%20Academy\"&gt;Serbian Royal Academy&lt;/a&gt; since 1892. He served as a senator during the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Kingdom of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; in 1901."
