    "text": "Infantry Online is a &lt;a href=\"Massively%20multiplayer%20online%20game\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; combat &lt;a href=\"video%20game\"&gt;video game&lt;/a&gt;. Originally released in 1999, the game was taken offline by Sony Online Entertainment and the servers shut down in March 2012. The Infantry community subsequently took control of the game and re-launched it independently at freeinfantry.com.\nGameplay.\nInfantry Online uses &lt;a href=\"2D%20computer%20graphics\"&gt;sprite animation&lt;/a&gt; graphics to model complex soldier, ground vehicle and space-ship models on typically complex terrains. Players may choose from a list of game zones to enter, each zone having a unique style of gameplay and many offering a wide diversity of weapons, player classes and objectives.\nHistory.\nIn 1997, the now-defunct development team &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Interactive%20Entertainment\"&gt;Virgin Interactive Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; (VIE) released the 2D Space Shooter, &lt;a href=\"SubSpace%20%28computer%20game%29\"&gt;SubSpace&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the SubSpace development formed Harmless Games LLC and developed Infantry during the late 1990s. Brainscan Development Corporation, also known as Brainscan Interactive, became publisher. &lt;a href=\"GameFan\"&gt;GameFan&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of Brainscan Interactive, went bankrupt.\nOn October 5, 2000 &lt;a href=\"Sony%20Online%20Entertainment\"&gt;Sony Online Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; (SOE) announced its acquisition of Infantry. Harmless Games, and its sole game, Infantry, was bought by SOE from Brainscan Interactive for an undisclosed sum. Infantry lead designer &lt;a href=\"Rod%20Humble\"&gt;Rod Humble&lt;/a&gt;, together with other developers, was offered a job with SOE to continue development of the game. &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Rift\"&gt;Cosmic Rift&lt;/a&gt; (CR), meant to compete with the still popular SubSpace, was developed as an offshoot of Infantry.\nIn May 2002, SOE introduced a monthly $6.95 pay-to-play system for SOE's three small action games: Infantry, CR and &lt;a href=\"Tanarus%20%28computer%20game%29\"&gt;Tanarus&lt;/a&gt;; however, both Infantry and Cosmic Rift remained free to play with limitations.\nStarting on June 26, 2007, SOE gave full and free online gaming access to Infantry and the rest of their \"Station Pass\" games.\nOn February 29, 2012, via mass-email, Sony Online Entertainment said that they would shut down the Infantry Online servers at the end of March.\nReception.\nOn three separate occasions Infantry won the MPOGD game of the month award. In June 2000, October 2000 and most recently January 2009."
