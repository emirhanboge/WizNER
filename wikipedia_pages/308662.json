    "text": "Chill\u00e1n () is the capital &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Chile\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"%C3%91uble%20Region\"&gt;\u00d1uble Region&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Diguill%C3%ADn%20Province\"&gt;Diguill\u00edn Province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; located about south of the country's capital, &lt;a href=\"Santiago\"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, near the geographical center of the country. It is the capital of the new &lt;a href=\"%C3%91uble%20Region\"&gt;\u00d1uble Region&lt;/a&gt; since 6 September 2015. Within the city are a railway station, an &lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28bus%29\"&gt;inter-city bus&lt;/a&gt; terminal, an agricultural extension of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Concepci%C3%B3n\"&gt;University of Concepci\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, and a regimental military base. The city includes a modern-style enclosed shopping mall in addition to the multi-block open-air street market where fruits, vegetables, crafts and clothing are sold. The nearby mountains are a popular destination for skiing and &lt;a href=\"hot%20spring\"&gt;hot spring&lt;/a&gt; bathing.\nFounded by the Spanish in 1580 the city insisted despite numerous attacks by &lt;a href=\"Mapuche\"&gt;Mapuche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pehuenche\"&gt;Pehuenche&lt;/a&gt;s and other tribes &lt;a href=\"Arauco%20War\"&gt;in war with Spain&lt;/a&gt;. Over time Chill\u00e1n became an important marketplace where Mapuches, Pehuenches, &lt;a href=\"Mestizo\"&gt;Mestizo&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Criollo%20people\"&gt;Criollos&lt;/a&gt; met. Many goods from &lt;a href=\"Patagonia\"&gt;Patagonia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pampas\"&gt;Argentine Pampas&lt;/a&gt; were brought into the market of Chill\u00e1n across the mountain passes of the area. In the early 19th century the countryside of Chill\u00e1n was ravaged by the &lt;a href=\"Chilean%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Chilean War of Independence&lt;/a&gt; and a subsequent &lt;a href=\"banditry%20in%20Chile\"&gt;banditry epidemic&lt;/a&gt;. In 1939 the city was devastated by &lt;a href=\"1939%20Chill%C3%A1n%20earthquake\"&gt;a large earthquake&lt;/a&gt; prompting the government to initiate an extensive reconstruction program.\nHistory.\nThe zone where Chill\u00e1n was built was previously inhabited by indigenous people called \"Chiquillanes\".\nChill\u00e1n was founded in 1580 at the site of &lt;a href=\"Chill%C3%A1n%20Viejo\"&gt;Chill\u00e1n Viejo&lt;/a&gt; as San Bartolom\u00e9 de Chill\u00e1n by &lt;a href=\"Mart%C3%ADn%20Ruiz%20de%20Gamboa\"&gt;Mart\u00edn Ruiz de Gamboa&lt;/a&gt;,\nwho was campaigning against the local indigenous peoples at the time, but this moniker did not fare well, and was replaced by the current name, which in the local Indian language means \"where the Sun is sitting\".\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Mapuche%20uprising%20of%201655\"&gt;Mapuche uprising of 1655&lt;/a&gt;, the city was besieged by Mapuche warriors. The Spanish defended the city from trenches and a palisade fort. Hoping for a miracle, the Spaniards put an image of Mary near the trenches, against which Mapuches are said to have shot arrows. In early March, about one month after the onset of uprising, distress was such that the Spaniards abandoned the city and headed north, escaping the conflict zone. The &lt;a href=\"Real%20Audiencia%20of%20Santiago\"&gt;Real Audiencia of Santiago&lt;/a&gt; declared the evacuation an act of cowardice, and prohibited refugees from Chill\u00e1n to go beyond the &lt;a href=\"Maule%20River\"&gt;Maule River&lt;/a&gt; north. As an outbreak of &lt;a href=\"smallpox\"&gt;smallpox&lt;/a&gt; occurred among the refugees, this was. in effect. a quarantine, as trespassing north was punished with death sentences.\nFrom its foundation, Chill\u00e1n has been at the heart of Chile's rich agricultural region. It is also in a region of seismic activity, suffering from devastating earthquakes throughout its history; the &lt;a href=\"1939%20Chill%C3%A1n%20earthquake\"&gt;1939 Chill\u00e1n earthquake&lt;/a&gt; left over 30,000 dead and mobilized international help.\nChile's &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20national%20founders\"&gt;founding father&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bernardo%20O%27Higgins\"&gt;Bernardo O'Higgins&lt;/a&gt;, was born in Chill\u00e1n in 1778. He was the force behind &lt;a href=\"Chilean%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Chile's Independence&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, being elected &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Chile\"&gt;supreme director&lt;/a&gt; and declaring independence after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Chacabuco\"&gt;Battle of Chacabuco&lt;/a&gt; against the Spaniards in 1817. His later victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Maip%C3%BA\"&gt;Maipo&lt;/a&gt; battlefield cemented the country's freedom. He died in exile in &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; in 1842.\nClimate.\nChill\u00e1n has a &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20climate%23Warm-summer%20Mediterranean%20climate\"&gt;Mediterranean climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; \"Csb\").

Temperatures can occasionally exceed from October to April. The average annual precipitation is , but it is highly variable from year to year, with 1982 being the wettest year at and 1998 being the driest year at only .\nThe air in Chill\u00e1n is the fourth-most polluted in Chile, after &lt;a href=\"Santiago\"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Temuco\"&gt;Temuco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Concepci%C3%B3n%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Concepci\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. \"As in Temuco, the main cause of air pollution in Chill\u00e1n is the use of wood-burning stoves; about 62% of all households in Chill\u00e1n use firewood as their main source of heating.\"\nDemographics.\nAccording to the 2002 &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Statistics%20Institute%20%28Chile%29\"&gt;National Statistics Institute&lt;/a&gt;, the commune of Chill\u00e1n spans an area of and has 161,953 inhabitants (77,007 men and 84,946 women). Of these, 148,015 (91.4%) lived in &lt;a href=\"urban%20area\"&gt;urban area&lt;/a&gt;s and 13,938 (8.6%) in &lt;a href=\"rural%20area\"&gt;rural area&lt;/a&gt;s. The population grew by 8.3% (12,442 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.\nThe &lt;a href=\"demonym\"&gt;demonym&lt;/a&gt; for a person from Chill\u00e1n, used for more than 400 years by local residents, is \"Chillanejo\", yet this is not found in the Royal Spanish Academy Dictionary, which only recognizes \"Chillanense\".\nNotable people.\nIn addition, Chill\u00e1n has offered a number of artists. A notable example is &lt;a href=\"Claudio%20Arrau\"&gt;Claudio Arrau&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"pianist\"&gt;pianist&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20Vinay\"&gt;Ram\u00f3n Vinay&lt;/a&gt; is the tenor who played &lt;a href=\"Otello\"&gt;Otello&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s, his recording of the role with Toscanini. He was a regular at the New York City &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt;, where he sang both tenor and baritone roles. One of his last performances at this house was as the &lt;a href=\"Barber%20of%20Seville\"&gt;Barber of Seville&lt;/a&gt;'s Basilio, a bass role. He retired from the stage in 1969.\nOther \"Chillanejos\" include writer &lt;a href=\"Marta%20Brunet\"&gt;Marta Brunet&lt;/a&gt;, sculptor &lt;a href=\"Marta%20Colvin\"&gt;Marta Colvin&lt;/a&gt;, painter &lt;a href=\"Pacheco%20Altamirano\"&gt;Pacheco Altamirano&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Juan%20de%20Dios%20Aldea\"&gt;Juan de Dios Aldea&lt;/a&gt;, who, however, did not reach the international acclaim achieved by Arrau and Vinay. \"&lt;a href=\"Super%20Smash%20Bros.\"&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/a&gt;\" player &lt;a href=\"Gonzalo%20%26quot%3BZeRo%26quot%3B%20Barrios\"&gt;Gonzalo \"ZeRo\" Barrios&lt;/a&gt; who had a record-breaking 56-tournament winning streak is also from Chill\u00e1n.\nAdministration.\nAs a commune, Chill\u00e1n is a third-level &lt;a href=\"administrative%20division%20of%20Chile\"&gt;administrative division of Chile&lt;/a&gt; administered by a &lt;a href=\"municipal%20council\"&gt;municipal council&lt;/a&gt;, headed by an \"&lt;a href=\"alcalde\"&gt;alcalde&lt;/a&gt;\", who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2020 \"alcalde\" is &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Zarzar%20Andonie\"&gt;Sergio Zarzar Andonie&lt;/a&gt; (ILE).\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"electoral%20divisions%20of%20Chile\"&gt;electoral divisions of Chile&lt;/a&gt;, Chill\u00e1n is represented in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; by Carlos Abel Jarpa (&lt;a href=\"Social%20Democrat%20Radical%20Party\"&gt;PRSD&lt;/a&gt;) and Rosauro Mart\u00ednez (&lt;a href=\"National%20Renewal%20%28Chile%29\"&gt;RN&lt;/a&gt;) as part of the 41st electoral district, together with &lt;a href=\"Coihueco\"&gt;Coihueco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pinto%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Pinto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Ignacio%2C%20Chile\"&gt;San Ignacio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"El%20Carmen%2C%20Chile\"&gt;El Carmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pemuco\"&gt;Pemuco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yungay%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Yungay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chill%C3%A1n%20Viejo\"&gt;Chill\u00e1n Viejo&lt;/a&gt;.
