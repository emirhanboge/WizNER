Swindon Town are the only Wiltshire representative in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; and have often used the Wiltshire Shield to field their youths, reserves and players who are returning from injury.\nThe competition consists of four teams. These are &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salisbury%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Salisbury City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chippenham%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Chippenham Town&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Supermarine%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Supermarine&lt;/a&gt;."
