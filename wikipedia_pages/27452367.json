Since 2007 his registration rights were owned by a \"football club\" from &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Alegre%20Futebol%20Clube\"&gt;Monte Alegre do Sul&lt;/a&gt;, and were originally loaned to Paulista. After a youth career with the S\u00e3o Paulo based club, the player was sent on loan in 2009 to &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Paulista%20S%C3%A9rie%20A3\"&gt;Campeonato Paulista S\u00e9rie A3&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Votoraty%20Futebol%20Clube\"&gt;Votoraty&lt;/a&gt; from Monte Alegre. Following his loan spell with the club, he returned to Paulista in June 2009.\nFollowing his return to Paulista FC, still on loan from Monte Alegre FC, along with teammate, &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Serrano%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Rafael Serrano&lt;/a&gt;, Martinho finally made his debut for the club, and during the 2010 season, he made 6 first team appearances &lt;a href=\"2010%20Campeonato%20Paulista\"&gt;2010 Campeonato Paulista&lt;/a&gt;. On 21 May 2010, the Brazilian midfielder would move to Sicilian giants, &lt;a href=\"Calcio%20Catania\"&gt;Calcio Catania&lt;/a&gt; of Italian &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed by Paulista. Martinho completed the deal in August after his &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; citizenship was confirmed.\nCalcio Catania.\nOn 21 May 2010, Raphael Martinho was officially announced to have joined &lt;a href=\"Calcio%20Catania\"&gt;Calcio Catania&lt;/a&gt;. In his first season with the club, Martinho was limited to just 11 league appearances, just 5 of which were starts.\nCesena loan.\nDue to his limited game time for the Sicilians, the club opted to loan the midfielder to newly promoted &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Cesena\"&gt;A.C. Cesena&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2011-12%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2011-12 Serie A&lt;/a&gt; season.. With the \"Seahorses\", Martinho appeared 18 times in the league, but was unable to help his club avoid relegation to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt;, as Cesena finished &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A%202011-12\"&gt;20th&lt;/a&gt;. Martinho returned to Catania on 30 June 2012.\nHellas Verona.\nOn 19 July 2012, &lt;a href=\"Calcio%20Catania\"&gt;Catania&lt;/a&gt; sent Martinho on a season-long loan deal to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; club, &lt;a href=\"Hellas%20Verona%20F.C.\"&gt;Hellas Verona&lt;/a&gt;, who also obtained the option to a co-ownership deal upon the expiration of the loan deal. The move proved very successful for the Brazilian, as he featured in 30 league matches, scoring 10 league goals, helping the Bentegodi-based club finish second in the &lt;a href=\"2011-12%20Serie%20B\"&gt;2011-12 Serie B&lt;/a&gt; league table and gain promotion to Serie A for the first time since &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A%202001-02\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;. At the conclusion of the loan deal, Hellas Verona took up their option to purchase 50% of the player's registration rights ahead of their return to the pinnacle of Italian football.\nOn 28 July 2015, &lt;a href=\"Calcio%20Catania\"&gt;Catania&lt;/a&gt; announced the termination of his contract.\nCarpi.\nMartinho joined &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Carpi%20F.C.%201909\"&gt;Carpi F.C. 1909&lt;/a&gt; on 28 July 2015.\nVirtus Entella.\nOn 1 February 2019, he was released from his contract by &lt;a href=\"Virtus%20Entella\"&gt;Virtus Entella&lt;/a&gt; by mutual consent.\nS\u00e3o Bento.\nOn 1 April 2019, Martinho moved back to Brazil and joined &lt;a href=\"Esporte%20Clube%20S%C3%A3o%20Bento\"&gt;Esporte Clube S\u00e3o Bento&lt;/a&gt;."
