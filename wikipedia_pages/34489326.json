    "text": "The 45th Infantry Division was an &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20Force\"&gt;Territorial Force&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt;. It was formed in the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; as a duplicate of the &lt;a href=\"43rd%20%28Wessex%29%20Infantry%20Division\"&gt;43rd (Wessex) Division&lt;/a&gt; and was originally formed as the 2nd Wessex Division in 1914\u20131915 before later being renamed as the 45th (2nd Wessex) Division and the &lt;a href=\"brigade\"&gt;brigade&lt;/a&gt;s numbered. It was sent overseas to &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; in December 1914 to relieve &lt;a href=\"Regular%20army\"&gt;Regular Army&lt;/a&gt; units for service in France. The division remained there for the rest of the war, supplying drafts of replacements to the British units fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Eastern%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; and later complete battalions.\nHistory.\nIn accordance with the &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20and%20Reserve%20Forces%20Act%201907\"&gt;Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"7%20Edw.%207\"&gt;7 Edw. 7&lt;/a&gt;, c.9\") which brought the &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20Force\"&gt;Territorial Force&lt;/a&gt; into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20Force%20Imperial%20Service%20Badge\"&gt;Imperial Service&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course.\nOn 15 August 1915, TF units were instructed to separate home service men from those who had volunteered for overseas service (1st Line), with the home service personnel to be formed into reserve units (2nd Line). On 31 August, 2nd Line units were authorized for each 1st Line unit where more than 60% of men had volunteered for overseas service. After being organized, armed and clothed, the 2nd Line units were gradually grouped into large formations thereby forming the 2nd Line brigades and divisions. These 2nd Line units and formations had the same name and structure as their 1st Line parents. On 24 November, it was decided to replace imperial service (1st Line) formations as they proceeded overseas with their reserve (2nd Line) formations. A second reserve (3rd Line) unit was then formed at the peace &lt;a href=\"Headquarters%23Military\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt; of the 1st Line.\nThe 2nd Wessex Division was formed in October 1914 as a 2nd Line duplicate of the &lt;a href=\"Wessex%20Division\"&gt;Wessex Division&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the units were only raised after the departure of the 1st Line division to &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; in the same month; officers and men of the 1st Line units left behind formed the core of the new units. In the event, the division did not consist of much more than 12 infantry &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt;s and 12 artillery &lt;a href=\"Artillery%20battery\"&gt;batteries&lt;/a&gt;; no &lt;a href=\"ammunition%20column\"&gt;ammunition column&lt;/a&gt;s, signals or &lt;a href=\"Train%20%28military%29\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; companies were formed. The &lt;a href=\"1st%20Somersetshire%20Engineers\"&gt;divisional engineers and signals&lt;/a&gt; remained in the UK and later joined &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Hamlets%20Engineers\"&gt;58th Divisional RE&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 22 September, India agreed to send 32 British and 20 Indian regular battalions to Europe in exchange for 43 partially trained TF battalions. Initially, it was intended that the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Division\"&gt;Welsh Division&lt;/a&gt; would join the Wessex and &lt;a href=\"Home%20Counties%20Division\"&gt;Home Counties Division&lt;/a&gt;s in India, but on 25 November, 10 infantry battalions and three field artillery brigades (9 batteries of &lt;a href=\"Ordnance%20BL%2015%20pounder\"&gt;15 pounders&lt;/a&gt;) of the 2nd Wessex Division were selected instead. On 12 December, the division embarked at &lt;a href=\"Southampton\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt; with 263 officers, 9,344 other ranks and 36 guns. The 2/4th &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Cornwall%27s%20Light%20Infantry\"&gt;DCLI&lt;/a&gt; and 2/4th &lt;a href=\"Hampshire%20Regiment\"&gt;Hampshires&lt;/a&gt; landed at &lt;a href=\"Karachi\"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt; on 9 January 1915 and the rest of the division at &lt;a href=\"Bombay\"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt; between 4 and 8 January.\nThe division was effectively broken up on arrival in India in January 1915; the units reverted to peacetime conditions and were dispersed throughout India and &lt;a href=\"British%20rule%20in%20Burma\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;. The battalions were posted to Bombay, &lt;a href=\"Poona\"&gt;Poona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Secunderabad\"&gt;Secunderabad&lt;/a&gt; (2), &lt;a href=\"Bangalore\"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ahmednagar\"&gt;Ahmednagar&lt;/a&gt;, Karachi, &lt;a href=\"Quetta\"&gt;Quetta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wellington%20Cantonment\"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meiktila\"&gt;Meiktila&lt;/a&gt; and the artillery brigades at &lt;a href=\"Kirkee\"&gt;Kirkee&lt;/a&gt;, Secunderabad and Bangalore. The Territorial Force divisions and brigades were numbered in May 1915 in the order that they departed for overseas service, starting with the &lt;a href=\"42nd%20%28East%20Lancashire%29%20Division\"&gt;42nd (East Lancashire) Division&lt;/a&gt;. The 2nd Wessex Division should have been numbered as the 45th (2nd Wessex) Division, but as the division had already been broken up, this was merely a place holder. The &lt;a href=\"2nd/1st%20Hampshire%20Brigade\"&gt;2nd/1st Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2nd/1st%20South%20Western%20Brigade\"&gt;2nd/1st South Western&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2nd/1st%20Devon%20and%20Cornwall%20Brigade\"&gt;2nd/1st Devon and Cornwall Brigade&lt;/a&gt;s were notionally numbered as 134th, 135th and 136th, respectively.\nThe units pushed on with training to prepare for active service, handicapped by the need to provide experienced manpower for active service units. By early 1916 it had become obvious that it would not be possible to transfer the division to the Western Front as originally intended. Nevertheless, individual units of the division proceeded overseas on active service through the rest of the war.\nIn 1916 and 1917, the artillery was reorganized; the batteries were initially lettered A, B and C in each brigade, one battery in each brigade was broken up to make the other batteries up to 6 guns and these were then numbered and rearmed with &lt;a href=\"18%20pounder\"&gt;18 pounder&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn 1917, five battalions went to &lt;a href=\"Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; between April and October, and two more went to &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamian%20campaign\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt; in September. By the beginning of 1918, just five batteries and three battalions remained in India. During 1919, the remaining units were reduced and returned to England and the division ceased to exist.\nCommanders.\n&lt;a href=\"Brigadier-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Br.-Gen.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Pinney\"&gt;R.J. Pinney&lt;/a&gt; was assigned to command the 2nd Wessex Division on formation on 9 October 1914. He was replaced two days later by Br.-Gen. &lt;a href=\"G.S.McD.%20Elliot\"&gt;G.S.McD. Elliot&lt;/a&gt; who remained in command until the division embarked for India. Br.-Gen. &lt;a href=\"G.H.%20Nicholson\"&gt;G.H. Nicholson&lt;/a&gt; commanded the division on its voyage; he handed over the troops on disembarkation and returned to England, arriving on 3 February 1915. All three officers had been &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;colonels&lt;/a&gt; commanding brigades of the Wessex DivisionDevon and Cornwall, South Western and Hampshire Brigades respectivelyat the outbreak of the war."
