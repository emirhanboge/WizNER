Clutton and E.W. Sherry between 1957 and 1963. The aircraft, registered \"G-ASZY\", first flew at &lt;a href=\"Meir%2C%20Staffordshire\"&gt;Meir&lt;/a&gt; aerodrome, &lt;a href=\"Stoke-on-Trent\"&gt;Stoke-on-Trent&lt;/a&gt; on 3 November 1963. It was a single-seat wood and fabric &lt;a href=\"Parasol%20wing\"&gt;parasol monoplane&lt;/a&gt; powered originally by a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Triumph%20motorcycles%23Post-war\"&gt;Triumph 5T&lt;/a&gt; motorcycle engine. By 1968 it was flying with a converted &lt;a href=\"Volkswagen%20air%20cooled%20engine\"&gt;Volkswagen engine&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Continental%20A-65\"&gt;Continental A-65&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"four%20stroke\"&gt;four stroke&lt;/a&gt; powerplant has also been used. The plans were made available to allow the aircraft to be homebuilt and thirty to forty examples have been built around the world."
