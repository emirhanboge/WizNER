When Line 12 extension is completed, it will also connect with Line 12 at &lt;a href=\"Observatorio%20metro%20station\"&gt;Observatorio&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe first section of Line 1 was opened on 4 September 1969 as part of Mexico City Metro's first construction stage, it was inaugurated by &lt;a href=\"Gustavo%20D%C3%ADaz%20Ordaz\"&gt;Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;President of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; from 1964 to 1970, and Alfonso Corona del Rosal, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20heads%20of%20government%20of%20Mexico%20City\"&gt;Regent of the Federal District Department&lt;/a&gt;. The inauguration ceremony took place at the &lt;a href=\"Insurgentes%20metro%20station\"&gt;Insurgentes&lt;/a&gt; station. The next day the line was opened to the public.\nTo the original route &lt;a href=\"Chapultepec%20metro%20station\"&gt;Chapultepec&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Zaragoza%20metro%20station%20%28Mexico%20City%29\"&gt;Zaragoza&lt;/a&gt; new station &lt;a href=\"Juanacatl%C3%A1n%20metro%20station\"&gt;Juanacatl\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; was added to the west on 11 April 1970, and the first \"correspondencia\" (a &lt;a href=\"Interchange%20station\"&gt;transfer station&lt;/a&gt;) became functional on 1 August 1970, when &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City%20Metro%20Line%202\"&gt;Line 2&lt;/a&gt; was opened. The two westernmost stations &lt;a href=\"Tacubaya%20metro%20station\"&gt;Tacubaya&lt;/a&gt; and current terminal &lt;a href=\"Observatorio%20metro%20station\"&gt;Observatorio&lt;/a&gt; were inaugurated on 20 November 1970 and 10 June 1972 respectively.\nStation &lt;a href=\"Pantitl%C3%A1n%20metro%20station\"&gt;Pantitl\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; was opened on 22 August 1984 as the eastern terminal during a fourth and final expansion. All twenty stations have operated since then, running a total track length of 18.83\u00a0km, of which 16.65\u00a0km are passenger track. The 1 is the only line in the network that is fully underground except for some surface track in Observatorio used for maintenance.\nAs of 2020, an extension of &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City%20Metro%20Line%2012\"&gt;Line 12&lt;/a&gt; is under construction, this stretch will connect Line 12 with Line 1 at the Observatorio station.\nAuthorities warned on 10 August &lt;a href=\"2020%20in%20Mexico\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; that Line 1 is in danger of a major fire due to an aging electrical system that is in need of major improvements. Lines 1, 2, and 3 report an average of 2.5 electrical failures daily.\nRolling stock.\nLine 1 has had different types of rolling stock throughout the years.\nCurrently, out of the 390 trains in the &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City%20Metro\"&gt;Mexico City Metro&lt;/a&gt; network, 49 are in service in Line 1.\nRidership.\nThe following table shows each of Line 1 stations total and average daily ridership during 2019.\nTourism.\nLine 1 passes near several places of interest:"
