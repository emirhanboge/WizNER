    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross\"&gt;Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross&lt;/a&gt; () and its variants were the highest awards in the military and paramilitary forces of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The decoration was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the acceptance by the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Knight%27s%20Cross%20Recipients\"&gt;Association of Knight's Cross Recipients&lt;/a&gt; (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the &lt;a href=\"German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29\"&gt;Heer&lt;/a&gt; (Army), &lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt; (Navy) and &lt;a href=\"Luftwaffe\"&gt;Luftwaffe&lt;/a&gt; (Air Force)\u2014as well as the &lt;a href=\"Waffen-SS\"&gt;Waffen-SS&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Labour%20Service\"&gt;Reich Labour Service&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Volkssturm\"&gt;Volkssturm&lt;/a&gt; (German national &lt;a href=\"militia\"&gt;militia&lt;/a&gt;). There were also 43 &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20foreign%20recipients%20of%20the%20Knight%27s%20Cross\"&gt;foreign recipients of the award&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, \u2014 \"The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945\". Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had received the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.\nListed here are the 32 Knight's Cross recipients whose last name starts with \"U\". Scherzer has challenged the validity of one listing. The recipients are ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded.\nBackground.\nThe Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate &lt;a href=\"Coming%20into%20force\"&gt;enactments&lt;/a&gt;. The first enactment, of 1 September 1939 instituted the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Cross\"&gt;Iron Cross&lt;/a&gt;, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross\"&gt;Grand Cross of the Iron Cross&lt;/a&gt;. Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the &lt;a href=\"Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves\"&gt;Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves&lt;/a&gt;, was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment of 28 September 1941 introduced the &lt;a href=\"Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves%20and%20Swords\"&gt;Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves%2C%20Swords%20and%20Diamonds\"&gt;Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of 1944 the final grade, the &lt;a href=\"Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Golden%20Oak%20Leaves%2C%20Swords%2C%20and%20Diamonds\"&gt;Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds&lt;/a&gt;, based on the enactment of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's Cross authorized.\nRecipients.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht\"&gt;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt; (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept separate Knight's Cross lists for the &lt;a href=\"German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29\"&gt;Heer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Army\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Navy\"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Luftwaffe\"&gt;Luftwaffe&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Air%20Force\"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Waffen-SS\"&gt;Waffen-SS&lt;/a&gt;. Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering &lt;a href=\"paradigm\"&gt;paradigm&lt;/a&gt; was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade. Of the 32 awards made to servicemen whose last name starts with \"U\", four were later awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and one presentation was made &lt;a href=\"Posthumous%20recognition\"&gt;posthumously&lt;/a&gt;. Heer members received 23 of the medals, none went to the Kriegsmarine, seven to the Luftwaffe, and two to the Waffen-SS."
