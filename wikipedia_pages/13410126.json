    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Vice-admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;Vice-Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, Sir George Carew (c. 1504 \u2013 19 July 1545) was an English soldier, admiral and adventurer during the reign of King &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; who died in the sinking of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; flagship \"&lt;a href=\"Mary%20Rose\"&gt;Mary Rose&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Solent\"&gt;Battle of the Solent&lt;/a&gt; during an attempted French invasion in the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20War%20of%201542%E2%80%931546\"&gt;Italian War of 1542\u20131546&lt;/a&gt;. Scion of a controversial and dramatic family, Carew had a wild youth and explored widely, being arrested several times for associating with rebellious vassals of the king. Carew successfully tamed this nature in his later years, during which he became a trusted advisor and military officer in the King's service.\nOrigins.\nHe was the son and heir of Sir William Carew (died 1538) of &lt;a href=\"Mohuns%20Ottery\"&gt;Mohuns Ottery&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Luppitt\"&gt;Luppitt&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Devon\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; by his wife Joane Courtenay, second daughter of Sir William I Courtenay (died 1485) of &lt;a href=\"Powderham%20Castle\"&gt;Powderham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20of%20Devon\"&gt;Sheriff of Devon&lt;/a&gt; in 1488. The exact date of George Carew's birth is unknown, but it is thought to have been between 1497 and 1504.\nChildhood.\nGeorge and his brother &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Carew%20%28died%201575%29\"&gt;Peter Carew&lt;/a&gt; were sent to be educated in the household of their mother's (distant) cousin &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Courtenay%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Exeter\"&gt;Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;. There they learned from adventurous relatives like their uncle &lt;a href=\"Gawen%20Carew\"&gt;Gawen Carew&lt;/a&gt; and kinsman &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Carew%20%28courtier%29\"&gt;Nicholas Carew&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of whom was later arrested and executed for treason.\nYouth.\nCarew trained in the law, but swiftly became bored and in 1526 was in &lt;a href=\"Blois\"&gt;Blois&lt;/a&gt;, France, seeking service with &lt;a href=\"Louise%20of%20Savoy\"&gt;Louise of Savoy&lt;/a&gt;, the French Regent. This attempt to serve a foreign power came to nothing, and was pardoned by King Henry VIII in November of the same year. The King also overlooked his youthful indiscretions with the followers of &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Barton\"&gt;Elizabeth Barton&lt;/a&gt; and encouraged responsible behaviour in the young man.\nCareer.\nCarew became interested in politics in the early 1530s and briefly sat in 1529 as a &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Devon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; and later served as &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff%20of%20Devon\"&gt;High Sheriff of Devon&lt;/a&gt; (for 1536 and 1542), during which period he was knighted. Carew was also married for the first time during the 1530s, to Thomasine Pollard, daughter of Sir &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20Pollard\"&gt;Lewis Pollard&lt;/a&gt; (c. 1465 \u2013 1540), &lt;a href=\"Justice%20of%20the%20Common%20Pleas\"&gt;Justice of the Common Pleas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1537, Carew was given his first sea commission, serving in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Channel\"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt; under Sir &lt;a href=\"John%20Dudley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland\"&gt;John Dudley&lt;/a&gt; during operations against pirates. In the following year 1538 he inherited his father's estates and returned to Devon to serve as &lt;a href=\"Justice%20of%20the%20Peace\"&gt;Justice of the Peace&lt;/a&gt;. In 1539 Carew's wife Thomasine Pollard died and he again entered the King's service, taking over the strategically vital fort of &lt;a href=\"Rysbank\"&gt;Rysbank&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Calais%20Pale\"&gt;Calais Pale&lt;/a&gt;. The fort's previous commander and Carew's kinsman &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Carew%20%28courtier%29\"&gt;Nicholas Carew&lt;/a&gt; had paid with his life for his machinations against the King. George Carew was disgusted with the poor state of readiness and repair in which he found the fort and set about effecting repairs and became involved in the administration of Calais under its &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20of%20Calais\"&gt;Deputy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Plantagenet%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Lisle\"&gt;Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernment service.\nCarew took pains during this period to distance himself from the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; upbringing he had in the household of the Marquess of Exeter and openly supported &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; groups who had fled to Calais after persecution elsewhere in Europe. His stance on this issue brought admiration from several contemporaries, including &lt;a href=\"John%20Foxe\"&gt;John Foxe&lt;/a&gt;. Carew was with the deputation which met &lt;a href=\"Anne%20of%20Cleves\"&gt;Anne of Cleves&lt;/a&gt; in December 1539 and the following year he was briefly arrested and questioned in relation to a plan to hand Rysbank over to the French, a plot in which Lisle was implicated but Carew apparently was not. In the late autumn of 1540 Carew remarried, to Mary Norris, daughter of the courtier Sir &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Norris%20%28courtier%29\"&gt;Henry Norreys&lt;/a&gt; of Berkshire, and the couple settled at &lt;a href=\"Polsloe%20Priory\"&gt;Polsloe Priory&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Exeter\"&gt;Exeter&lt;/a&gt;. Carew had taken his position seriously, and was rewarded with a second term as sheriff in 1542 and was appointed Steward of the possessions of the Marquis of Exeter, a role with annual salary of \u00a330. Two years later in 1544 he was made lieutenant of the &lt;a href=\"Gentlemen%20Pensioners\"&gt;Gentlemen Pensioners&lt;/a&gt; and was awarded the large salary of \u00a3365 a year.\nApparently bored with Rysbank and political life, in the summer of 1543 Carew applied to join the army of &lt;a href=\"John%20Wallop\"&gt;Sir John Wallop&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; as a lieutenant general of horse. Although Carew was an accomplished jouster, he was tactically inexperienced and learned the military arts through his position on Wallop's army council. With his brother Peter, George Carew saw action in skirmishes outside the French-held towns of &lt;a href=\"Th%C3%A9rouanne\"&gt;Th\u00e9rouanne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Landrecies\"&gt;Landrecies&lt;/a&gt; during Wallop's campaigns against those towns. At Landrecis, Carew twice came close to disaster, almost being killed by a sniper's bullet during the summer and in November actually being captured after pursuing a fleeing band of French cavalry too far and finding himself isolated. He was soon freed however at the express request of King Henry VIII and was returned to the English army. In 1544 Carew raised twenty soldiers to join Wallop's campaign against &lt;a href=\"Boulogne-sur-Mer\"&gt;Boulogne&lt;/a&gt; and was also given a subordinate naval command under Dudley in the English Channel.\nDrowning in the \"Mary Rose\".\nIn July 1545, with a French invasion expected, Carew was summoned to King Henry VIII's council of war aboard his flagship \"&lt;a href=\"Great%20Harry\"&gt;Great Harry&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;. There Carew was appointed Vice-Admiral in charge of the fleet in Portsmouth and presented with a golden whistle as symbol of office. The French fleet landed on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Wight\"&gt;Isle of Wight&lt;/a&gt; the same day and shortly afterwards sailed for Portsmouth. The French force greatly outnumbered the English, comprising 175 ships including 25 great &lt;a href=\"galley\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt;s. Carew, as captain of the \"&lt;a href=\"Mary%20Rose\"&gt;Mary Rose&lt;/a&gt;\", the vice-flagship of the English &lt;a href=\"carrack\"&gt;carrack&lt;/a&gt; fleet, sailed to confront them and met with disaster.\nIt may never be known exactly why the \"Mary Rose\" sank in the entrance to Portsmouth harbour on 19 July 1545, but it is believed that water entered open gunports after firing a broadside and the ship went down in minutes. The report that Carew's last words called out to his uncle Gawen Carew aboard an accompanying ship, that \"I have the sort of knaves I cannot rule\", may indicate command and discipline problems. Carew had only taken command of the ship that same day and his authority was far from established. The dangerous combination of winds, tides and shallows makes the &lt;a href=\"Solent\"&gt;Solent&lt;/a&gt; a particularly hazardous body of water. Modern studies have also indicated that the aging 700-ton warship was dangerously overloaded, with heavy bronze cannon that she was not designed to carry, and nearly 500 men aboard, many dressed in full armour. Scientific examination of the crew's skulls has revealed that the majority of the men aboard 'Mary Rose' the day she foundered were probably from Southern Europe, maybe mercenaries or prisoners of war.\nHenry VIII watched from &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Castle\"&gt;Southsea Castle&lt;/a&gt; as the \"Mary Rose\" heeled over and sank shortly after joining the battle, and heard the screams of her drowning crew, most of whom were trapped beneath a heavy anti-boarding net stretched across her &lt;a href=\"weather%20deck\"&gt;weather deck&lt;/a&gt;. Of the 500 men aboard fewer than 25 survived, Carew not among them. His body was never recovered. Despite the disaster, the French fleet failed to engage effectively with the English and turned away to perform minor raids elsewhere on the coast returning to France in August. Carew's widow was given a job in the royal household as a lady in waiting to the King's daughters princesses &lt;a href=\"Mary%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Mary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;. She later married Sir &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Champernowne\"&gt;Arthur Champernowne&lt;/a&gt;, and died in 1570. When the \"Mary Rose\" was raised nearly 450 years later, pewter plates stamped with \"G.C.\", Carew's initials, were among the artifacts recovered from the wreck.\nMarriages.\nGeorge Carew married twice, but left no children:"
