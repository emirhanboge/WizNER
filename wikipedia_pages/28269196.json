    "text": "Jon Shafer is an American designer and programmer of &lt;a href=\"video%20games\"&gt;computer games&lt;/a&gt;. He was the &lt;a href=\"designer\"&gt;lead designer&lt;/a&gt; of the strategy game \"&lt;a href=\"Civilization%20V\"&gt;Civilization V&lt;/a&gt;\", developed by &lt;a href=\"Firaxis%20Games\"&gt;Firaxis&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrently, Shafer is the president of Conifer Games, a &lt;a href=\"video%20game%20development\"&gt;video games development&lt;/a&gt; company he founded in 2012. The studio's first title is \"Jon Shafer's At The Gates\", a &lt;a href=\"4X\"&gt;4X&lt;/a&gt; strategy game similar to \"&lt;a href=\"Civilization%20%28series%29\"&gt;Civilization&lt;/a&gt;\" in which players command a &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt; kingdom with the goal of defeating both rival tribes and the waning &lt;a href=\"fall%20of%20Rome\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The budget for developing \"At the Gates\" is primarily made up of funds raised through a &lt;a href=\"Kickstarter\"&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; campaign held in February 2013.\nLife and career.\nShafer was born and grew up in &lt;a href=\"Aurora%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Aurora, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. He learned to &lt;a href=\"computer%20programming\"&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; when he was 8 years old from his father, and as a child also cultivated a passion for history.\nThese interests led Shafer to &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Meier\"&gt;Sid Meier&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Civilization%20%28series%29\"&gt;Civilization&lt;/a&gt;\" series. He developed fan &lt;a href=\"Mod%20%28computer%20gaming%29\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"Civilization%20III\"&gt;Civilization III&lt;/a&gt;\" while in &lt;a href=\"high%20school\"&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt;, and became a &lt;a href=\"beta%20tester\"&gt;beta tester&lt;/a&gt; for the \"Civilization III\" &lt;a href=\"expansion%20pack\"&gt;expansion pack&lt;/a&gt;, ', and \"&lt;a href=\"Civilization%20IV\"&gt;Civilization IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Early in \"Civilization IV's\" development he wrote an extensive guide explaining how to utilize its &lt;a href=\"Python%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; scripting language, and this led to him joining Firaxis for a &lt;a href=\"Game%20programming\"&gt;programming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internship\"&gt;internship&lt;/a&gt; in February 2005. Shafer was later hired full-time, and served as a designer and programmer on the two \"Civilization IV\" expansions, ' and \"\".\nFollowing the completion of \"Beyond the Sword\", Shafer was named the lead designer and &lt;a href=\"programmer\"&gt;principal gameplay programmer&lt;/a&gt; for \"Civilization V\", the next full title in the series. While in this role, Shafer drew from his past modding experience and from computer games he had played as a child, most notably \"&lt;a href=\"Panzer%20General\"&gt;Panzer General&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn January 2011, Shafer joined &lt;a href=\"Stardock\"&gt;Stardock&lt;/a&gt; to lead an unannounced game project and assist with development on the \"\" series. In February 2013, he announced that he had left Stardock and founded Conifer Games, and was now developing a new 4X title, \"&lt;a href=\"At%20the%20Gates%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;At the Gates&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn June 2017, Shafer joined &lt;a href=\"Paradox%20Development%20Studio\"&gt;Paradox Development Studio&lt;/a&gt; as a game director on an unannounced project, only to part ways in November of the same year, citing creative differences.\nShafer attended &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20State%20University\"&gt;Colorado State University&lt;/a&gt; from 2002\u20132005, studying &lt;a href=\"history\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"computer%20science\"&gt;computer science&lt;/a&gt;. After acquiring a position at Firaxis he left Colorado State but later completed his undergraduate study at &lt;a href=\"Towson%20University\"&gt;Towson University&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 with a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Science\"&gt;BS&lt;/a&gt; in History."
