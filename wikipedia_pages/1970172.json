    "text": "Catla (\"Labeo catla\"), () also known as the major South Asian carp, is an economically important South Asian freshwater fish in the carp family &lt;a href=\"Cyprinidae\"&gt;Cyprinidae&lt;/a&gt;. It is native to rivers and lakes in northern &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Myanmar\"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, but has also been &lt;a href=\"Introduced%20species\"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere in South Asia and is commonly &lt;a href=\"Fish%20farming\"&gt;farmed&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Nepal and neighbouring regions of India, up to Odisha, it is called Bhakura.\nCatla is a fish with large and broad head, a large protruding lower jaw, and upturned mouth. It has large, greyish scales on its dorsal side and whitish on its belly. It reaches up to in length and in weight.) \n)()(Catla is a surface and midwater feeder. Adults feed on zooplankton using large gill rakers, but young ones on both zooplankton and phytoplankton. Catla attains sexual maturity at an average age of two years and an average weight of 2\u00a0kg.\nTaxonomy.\nThe catla was formerly listed as the only species in the genus \"Catla\", but this was a synonym of the genus \"Gibelion\". More recently, &lt;a href=\"Catalog%20of%20Fishes\"&gt;Catalog of Fishes&lt;/a&gt; has moved this species to \"&lt;a href=\"Labeo\"&gt;Labeo&lt;/a&gt;\". This species has often been confused with the &lt;a href=\"giant%20barb\"&gt;giant barb&lt;/a&gt; (\"Catlocarpio siamensis\") of south-east Asia as the two taxa bear an extraordinary resemblance to each other, especially in their very large heads.\nAquaculture.\nIt is one of the most important &lt;a href=\"aquaculture\"&gt;aquaculture&lt;/a&gt;d freshwater species in &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is grown in &lt;a href=\"polyculture\"&gt;polyculture&lt;/a&gt; ponds with other carp-like fish, particularly with the &lt;a href=\"roho%20labeo\"&gt;roho labeo&lt;/a&gt; (\"Labeo rohita\") and &lt;a href=\"mrigal\"&gt;mrigal carp&lt;/a&gt;. The reported production numbers have increased sharply during the 2000s, and were in 2012 about 2.8 million tonnes per year.\nCatla is sold and consumed fresh, locally and regionally. It is transported on ice. Fish of 1\u20132\u00a0kg weight are preferred by consumers."
