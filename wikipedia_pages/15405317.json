    "text": "William Varnham Millton (10 February 1858 \u2013 22 June 1887) was a New Zealand &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player and &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;er. He was the first captain of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;New Zealand national rugby union team&lt;/a&gt;, leading them on their &lt;a href=\"1884%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;1884 tour of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, and represented Canterbury in both rugby union and cricket.\nEarly life and family.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Christchurch\"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt; on 10 February 1858, Millton was the eldest son of William Newton Millton, a sea captain and runholder, and his wife Caroline Millton (n\u00e9e Stockman). He was educated at &lt;a href=\"Christ%27s%20College%2C%20Christchurch\"&gt;Christ's College&lt;/a&gt; from 1869 to 1876, and went on to become a barrister and solicitor. On 23 April 1885, Millton married Elizabeth Anderson at &lt;a href=\"St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Christchurch\"&gt;St Paul's Church&lt;/a&gt; in Christchurch. She was the youngest daughter of &lt;a href=\"John%20Anderson%20%28mayor%29\"&gt;John Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, who served as the second mayor of Christchurch, and her brother, also called &lt;a href=\"John%20Anderson%20%28New%20Zealand%20engineer%29\"&gt;John Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, played rugby for &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in 1872, and was the first New Zealander to appear in a rugby international.\nOne of Millton's brothers, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Millton\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt;, also represented New Zealand in rugby union.\nCricket.\nA batsman, Millton was captain of both the United Cricket Club in Christchurch and the &lt;a href=\"Canterbury%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; provincial side. Between the 1877\u201378 and 1886\u201387 seasons, he played 12 first-class matches for Canterbury, scoring a total of 298 runs, at an average of 14.19 and a high score of 57. He made one 50, and took six catches. He captained Canterbury and hit the equal-highest score of the match, 35, when Canterbury had the better of a draw against the touring &lt;a href=\"Australia%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Australians&lt;/a&gt; in November 1886.\nRugby union.\nMillton was a rugby representative from 1876 and captain of the side from 1878. While visiting Auckland and Wellington with the Canterbury cricket team, he met with rugby officials and suggested a tour to Australia. Subsequently, in 1884, the first New Zealand national rugby union team was selected to &lt;a href=\"1884%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;tour New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, with Millton as its captain. He led the side in their first-ever match, a pre-tour fixture against a Wellington XV at &lt;a href=\"Newtown%20Park\"&gt;Newtown Park&lt;/a&gt; in Wellington, in eight of the nine tour matches in Australia, including the three encounters with &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, and was unbeaten as captain. In all he scored 35 points, including four tries. Three of his tries came in the 23\u201310 win against Wallaroo and University, and he scored another try in the final match against New South Wales. Millton did not appear in any Test matches because New Zealand did not play its first full international until 1903.\nMillton also served as secretary of the Canterbury Rugby Football Union.\nDeath.\nMillton died of &lt;a href=\"typhoid\"&gt;typhoid&lt;/a&gt; at his home in Christchurch on 22 June 1887, and was buried in St Peter's churchyard, &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Riccarton\"&gt;Upper Riccarton&lt;/a&gt;."
