    "text": "The Central Combination was a short-lived &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; league in central England. The league was established in 1933 to create a stepping stone for clubs looking to progress from county leagues to the &lt;a href=\"Midland%20Football%20League%20%281889%29\"&gt;Midland League&lt;/a&gt; and initially had 17 members. However, after losing around a third of its members in 1935, the league was reduced to nine clubs. Although it gained an extra member for the 1936\u201337 season, the league folded in the summer of 1937."
