    "text": "Matthew Luke (died 1722, occasionally named Mateo Luque or Matteo Luca) was a pirate active in the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLuke, originally from &lt;a href=\"Genoa\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt;, had been cruising the Caribbean under commission from the Spanish Governor of &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; as a \"guarda costa\" &lt;a href=\"privateer\"&gt;privateer&lt;/a&gt;. With his sloop \"Vengeance\" (or \"Venganza\") he had earlier captured four English vessels and murdered their crews. In April 1722 he spotted a merchant ship off of &lt;a href=\"Hispaniola\"&gt;Hispaniola&lt;/a&gt; and moved alongside to attack it. The ship turned out to be Captain Candler\u2019s 40-gun &lt;a href=\"fifth-rate\"&gt;fifth-rate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt; \"HMS Launceton\" (or \"Lauceston / Lanceston\"), sent to the Caribbean to replace the scrapped \"HMS Ludlow Castle\".\nCandler\u2019s men boarded the \"Vengeance\", whose sailors claimed she was a merchant trader. The paper wrap from a &lt;a href=\"Paper%20cartridge\"&gt;powder cartridge&lt;/a&gt; was determined to be a page from the journal of a &lt;a href=\"Snow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; named \"Crean\", whose crew had been murdered. In the ship\u2019s hold they found the rest of the 58-man crew in hiding, all of which were arrested and returned to &lt;a href=\"Port%20Royal\"&gt;Port Royal&lt;/a&gt;. The Launceton's logbooks note, \"25 Apr 1722 - Cape Tiberon - captured boat from Puerto Rico with hiding crew.\" The crewmen were tried and shown to be pirates, one of whom confessed to killing twenty English men with his bare hands. Despite Spanish objections that the vessel had a legitimate privateering commission, over forty of the pirates were hanged."
