    "text": "The 1981 Icelandic Cup was the 22nd edition of the National Football Cup.\nIt took place between 26 May 1980 and 30 August 1981, with the final played at &lt;a href=\"Laugardalsv%C3%B6llur\"&gt;Laugardalsv\u00f6llur&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Reykjavik\"&gt;Reykjavik&lt;/a&gt;. The cup was important, as winners qualified for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; (if a club won both the league and the cup, the defeated finalists would take their place in the Cup Winners' Cup).\nThe 10 clubs from the &lt;a href=\"1980%20%C3%9Arvalsdeild\"&gt;1. Deild&lt;/a&gt; entered in the last 16, with clubs from lower tiers entering in the three preliminary rounds. Teams played one-legged matches. In case of a draw, the match was replayed at the opposition's ground.\nThe final was a rematch of the previous season - &lt;a href=\"Fram%20Reykjavik\"&gt;Fram Reykjavik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%8DBV%20Vestmannaeyjar\"&gt;\u00cdBV Vestmannaeyjar&lt;/a&gt; meeting, but on this occasion it was the club from &lt;a href=\"Vestmannaeyjar\"&gt;Vestmannaeyjar&lt;/a&gt; who qualified for Europe. IBV won the Icelandic Cup for the fourth time."
