It belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Lauterecken-Wolfstein\"&gt;\"Verbandsgemeinde\" Lauterecken-Wolfstein&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nMerzweiler lies in the Jeckenbach valley in the Western &lt;a href=\"Palatinate%20%28region%29\"&gt;Palatinate&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Palatinate%20Forest\"&gt;Palatinate Forest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hunsr%C3%BCck\"&gt;Hunsr\u00fcck&lt;/a&gt; at elevations ranging from 250 to 260\u00a0m above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;. The elevations around the village reach heights of more than 300\u00a0m above sea level (Brecherberg 362\u00a0m, R\u00fcllberg 350\u00a0m). The municipal area measures 226\u00a0ha, of which roughly 2\u00a0ha is settled and 27\u00a0ha is wooded.\nNeighbouring municipalities.\nMerzweiler borders in the north on the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Hoppst%C3%A4dten\"&gt;Hoppst\u00e4dten&lt;/a&gt;, in the east on the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Kappeln%2C%20Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Kappeln&lt;/a&gt;, in the southeast on the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Grumbach\"&gt;Grumbach&lt;/a&gt;, in the southwest on the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Herren-Sulzbach\"&gt;Herren-Sulzbach&lt;/a&gt; and in the west on the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Langweiler%2C%20Kusel\"&gt;Langweiler&lt;/a&gt;. Merzweiler also meets the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Homberg%2C%20Kusel\"&gt;Homberg&lt;/a&gt; at a single point in the southwest.\nMunicipality\u2019s layout.\nMerzweiler lies at a crossroads of one road running east-west from &lt;a href=\"Kappeln%2C%20Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Kappeln&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Langweiler%2C%20Kusel\"&gt;Langweiler&lt;/a&gt;, and another running north-south from &lt;a href=\"Hoppst%C3%A4dten\"&gt;Hoppst\u00e4dten&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Grumbach\"&gt;Grumbach&lt;/a&gt;. The village community centre stands in the middle of the village where the road to Hoppst\u00e4dten branches off. In the past, the village won prizes on various occasions in the contest \"Unser Dorf soll sch\u00f6ner werden\" (\u201cOur village should become lovelier\u201d). Among the old farmhouses, the \"Einfirsthaus\" (\u201chouse with a single roof ridge\u201d) is predominant. The small graveyard lies in the village's south end on the road leading to Grumbach.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nIt is certain that the Merzweiler area was settled in &lt;a href=\"Prehistory\"&gt;prehistoric times&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; times, a &lt;a href=\"villa%20rustica\"&gt;villa rustica&lt;/a&gt; stood where the village is now, and according to old literary citations, as early as 1756, the remnants of a round &lt;a href=\"Roman%20temple\"&gt;Roman temple&lt;/a&gt; with mighty stone blocks were unearthed, a complex with a diameter of some \u201c200 paces\u201d. The digs yielded some valuable statues, among them a \u201c&lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt; with the club\u201d. One statue had an inscription on its base reading \"Merkurius\". The excavation site can still be picked out today in the cadastral area called \u201cAuf Burg\u201d. About the unearthed sculpture's whereabouts today, though, nothing is known.\nMiddle Ages.\nIt is likely that the &lt;a href=\"Franks\"&gt;Frankish&lt;/a&gt; farm that became the seed that grew into Merzweiler arose sometime between 800 and 1000. Originally, from 960 to 1140, the village lay in the &lt;a href=\"Nahegau\"&gt;Nahegau&lt;/a&gt;, ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Emichones\"&gt;Emichones&lt;/a&gt;, but was not mentioned in the documents according to which various villages of the \"Heidegericht\" (\u201cHeath Court\u201d) were pledged by the &lt;a href=\"Waldgrave\"&gt;Waldgrave&lt;/a&gt;s to either the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Veldenz\"&gt;Counts of Veldenz&lt;/a&gt; or the Dukes of &lt;a href=\"Palatinate-Zweibr%C3%BCcken\"&gt;Zweibr\u00fccken&lt;/a&gt;. The village likely passed as early as the 12th century to the County of Veldenz when this was founded by Count Gerlach I. Nevertheless, the village's name did not appear among those listed in the 1387 \u201cbrotherly partition\u201d between Counts Friedrich and Heinrich of Veldenz either. However, that document does say, in archaic &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;, that Count Friedrich was to receive \u201c\"die dorffer und armelude zu Meisenheim, die bisher in das Ampt zu Meisenheim geh\u00f6rig sind\"\u201d (\u201cthe villages and poor people at &lt;a href=\"Meisenheim\"&gt;Meisenheim&lt;/a&gt;, which hitherto have belonged in the \"&lt;a href=\"Amt%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;Amt&lt;/a&gt;\" at Meisenheim\u201d). Merzweiler must have been among these villages. Even before 1426, the Counts of Veldenz had granted the court at Merzweiler to the House of Boiz von Reipoltskirchen, first to Conrad Boiz, then to Hermann the Elder and last to Hermann the Younger. In 1438, the &lt;a href=\"fief\"&gt;fief&lt;/a&gt; passed to Hermann the Younger's son-in-law, Godelmann Blick von Lichtenberg. As a Veldenz, and later Zweibr\u00fccken village, Merzweiler always belonged to the \"Amt\", later \"Oberamt\", of Meisenheim.\nModern times.\nMerzweiler was a church seat, possibly right from the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Early Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=\"church%20%28building%29\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; was enfeoffed with the St. Antoniushof (estate) near &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Sobernheim\"&gt;Sobernheim&lt;/a&gt;. In 1563, the church gave this fief for one hundred years to Guff Hansen. In the Treaty of Meisenheim of 20 March 1595, &lt;a href=\"John%20I%2C%20Count%20Palatine%20of%20Zweibr%C3%BCcken\"&gt;Count Palatine Johannes I&lt;/a&gt; gave Merzweiler to the regents of Rhinegrave Christoph von Grumbach's sons, exchanging it for the villages of &lt;a href=\"Bosenbach\"&gt;Bosenbach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oberstaufenbach\"&gt;Staufenbach&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, the Count Palatine was granted leave to develop the brine &lt;a href=\"spring%20%28hydrology%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Sankt%20Julian\"&gt;Sankt Julian&lt;/a&gt;. The Antoniushof, as an ecclesiastical fief to the Lords of Hansen, was confiscated by the Rhinegraves. In the course of the treaty negotiations, Count Palatine Johannes had a report put together from which one can learn details from the late 16th century about Merzweiler. It says that the Count Palatine was responsible for both high and low \"Oberkeit\" (something akin to \u201csuperiority\u201d), could have incomes and levies at his disposal, and had hunting rights. It also names all the &lt;a href=\"Serfdom\"&gt;serfs&lt;/a&gt;, 13 families with 44 inhabitants. A serf here belonged, together with his family, to the Count of Palatinate-Veldenz, whose residence was at &lt;a href=\"Lauterecken\"&gt;Lauterecken&lt;/a&gt;, but was nevertheless ready to show the Duke of Zweibr\u00fccken the customary subservience. At the time of the exchange, it was clearly laid out what taxes and payments Merzweiler's inhabitants had to pay before 1595. The Duke of Zweibr\u00fccken received from the \"Beth\" (tax) each year 1 &lt;a href=\"Rhenish%20guilder\"&gt;Rhenish guilder&lt;/a&gt;, 4 \"Alben\" and 2 &lt;a href=\"Pfennig\"&gt;Pfennig&lt;/a&gt;e. From land taxes he got 19 Rhenish guilders and 4 &lt;a href=\"Batzen\"&gt;Batzen&lt;/a&gt;. In kind, each household had to deliver to him 11 chickens along with 1 \"Simmer\" of fodder &lt;a href=\"oat\"&gt;oat&lt;/a&gt;s for each horse, all together 7 \"Simmer\". Even the lowly serf who belonged to the Counts of Palatinate-Veldenz (Lauterecken) had to pay their part in all of this. Out of the wine tithes, one third each had to go to the Count Palatine, the Meisenheim parish priest and Antoni Bos's &lt;a href=\"widow\"&gt;widow&lt;/a&gt;, meaning a rich landholder's family. In an ordinary year, the wine tithe could be as much as 4 or 5 \"Ohm\" (an \"Ohm\" was usually something between 134 and 174.75\u00a0L). Of the grain tithe, yearly 6 to 7 \"Malter\", half corn (&lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"rye\"&gt;rye&lt;/a&gt;) and half oats, one third went to the Meisenheim parish priest while the other two thirds went to the Lords Cratz von Scharfenstein. Payments had to be made to the Church of Merzweiler itself, too, yearly in money 14 Rhenish guilders and 7 \"Alben\", in grain 3 \"Malter\", 2 \"Simmer\" 2 \"Dreiling\" and 2 \"Sester\" of corn and 3 \"Malter\" and 1 \"Simmer\" of oats. These were received and tallied by the Meisenheim church steward. During the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt; (1618\u201348), Merzweiler was drawn harshly into hardship, particularly in 1635 and 1636 when &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;n troops, who were on the &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Emperor's&lt;/a&gt; side, attacked, as did troops under the likewise &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; General &lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Gallas\"&gt;Matthias Gallas&lt;/a&gt;. The villagers fled to the nearby woods and watched as the village's houses were destroyed. Hunger and the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20%28disease%29\"&gt;Plague&lt;/a&gt; decimated the population. Many villagers moved to places that were not quite as harshly affected by the war. When the war ended, a taxation report read \u201cHere it must be said that owing to all kinds of war danger most people have died and owing to dearth have moved out of the land and the taxes and levies are therefore not being raised.\u201d In &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV%20of%20France\"&gt;King Louis XIV's&lt;/a&gt; wars of conquest, there were once more losses. It was relatively calm in the 18th century. The population grew once again, and there was even &lt;a href=\"emigration\"&gt;emigration&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. In Merzweiler once lived Johannes B\u00fcckler's (1777\u20131803) grandparents, whose notorious grandson was better known as &lt;a href=\"Schinderhannes\"&gt;Schinderhannes&lt;/a&gt;. B\u00fcckler's grandfather Otto Philipp B\u00fcckler was born about 1709 in &lt;a href=\"Hilscheid\"&gt;Hilscheid&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Idar%20Forest\"&gt;Idar Forest&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Thalfang\"&gt;Thalfang&lt;/a&gt;, worked as a &lt;a href=\"Scharfrichter\"&gt;headsman&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"knacker\"&gt;knacker&lt;/a&gt; and died in 1777 in Merzweiler. B\u00fcckler's grandmother Maria Magdalena Riemenschneider (1738\u20131770) came from Merzweiler. Johannes B\u00fcckler (1758\u20131803), Schinderhannes's father, was born in Merzweiler.\nRecent times.\nDuring the time of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;ic era that followed, the German lands on the &lt;a href=\"Rhine\"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s left bank were annexed by France. Merzweiler now belonged to the \"Mairie\" (\u201cMayoralty\u201d) of Grumbach, the &lt;a href=\"Cantons%20of%20France\"&gt;Canton&lt;/a&gt; of Grumbach, the &lt;a href=\"Arrondissements%20of%20France\"&gt;Arrondissement&lt;/a&gt; of Birkenfeld and the &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;Department&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sarre%20%28department%29\"&gt;Sarre&lt;/a&gt;. As early as 1793, &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolutionary%20Wars\"&gt;French Revolutionary troops&lt;/a&gt; advanced through the Glan valley and billeted themselves in the villages in the &lt;a href=\"Grumbach\"&gt;Grumbach&lt;/a&gt; area. There were assaults by Revolutionary troops against the local populace. After the French were driven out in 1814, the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; established a new political order in post-Napoleonic &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. In 1816, Merzweiler thus passed to the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Lichtenberg\"&gt;Principality of Lichtenberg&lt;/a&gt;, a newly created &lt;a href=\"exclave\"&gt;exclave&lt;/a&gt; of the Duchy of &lt;a href=\"Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld\"&gt;Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld&lt;/a&gt;, which as of 1826 became the Duchy of &lt;a href=\"Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha\"&gt;Saxe-Coburg and Gotha&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this state, it passed by sale in 1834 to the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, which made this area into the Sankt Wendel district within the &lt;a href=\"Rhine%20Province\"&gt;Rhine Province&lt;/a&gt;. This district was split into several \"&lt;a href=\"Amt%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;\u00c4mter&lt;/a&gt;\"; Merzweiler belonged to the \"Amt\" of Grumbach. Later, after the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt; stipulated, among other things, that 26 of the Sankt Wendel district's 94 municipalities had to be ceded to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;- and &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Military%20occupation\"&gt;occupied&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saar%20%28League%20of%20Nations%29\"&gt;Saar&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining 68 municipalities then bore the designation \u201cRestkreis St. Wendel-Baumholder\u201d, with the first syllable of \"Restkreis\" having the same meaning as in English, in the sense of \u201cleft over\u201d. Merzweiler belonged to this district until 1937, when it was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Birkenfeld%20%28district%29\"&gt;Birkenfeld district&lt;/a&gt;, formed out of the \"Restkreis\" and a formerly &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Oldenburg\"&gt;Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt;-held district, also called Birkenfeld. This new, bigger Birkenfeld district lay within the Prussian \"&lt;a href=\"Regierungsbezirk\"&gt;Regierungsbezirk&lt;/a&gt;\" of Koblenz. After the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the village at first lay within the \"Regierungsbezirk\" of Koblenz in the then newly founded &lt;a href=\"States%20of%20Germany\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt;. In 1968, in the course of administrative restructuring, the \"Amt\" of Grumbach was dissolved, and Merzweiler was then transferred to the Kusel district, in which it remains today. In 1972, Merzweiler passed to the then newly founded &lt;a href=\"Lauterecken%20%28Verbandsgemeinde%29\"&gt;\"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Lauterecken&lt;/a&gt;, and at the same time from the \"Regierungsbezirk\" of Koblenz to the newly founded \"Regierungsbezirk\" of &lt;a href=\"Rheinhessen-Pfalz\"&gt;Rheinhessen-Pfalz&lt;/a&gt;, which has, however, since been dissolved.\nPopulation development.\nUntil a few decades ago, the greater part of Merzweiler's population earned its livelihood mainly at &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the farmers, there were also farmhands, forestry workers and a few craftsmen. There were hardly any other jobs to be had. Even today, the land within municipal limits is still worked, although few people nowadays work in farming. A good deal of those in the workforce must seek employment elsewhere. As early as 1955, of the 56 active workforce members in Merzweiler, 48 had to &lt;a href=\"Commuting\"&gt;commute&lt;/a&gt; to jobs.\nThe following table shows population development over the centuries for Merzweiler:\nMunicipality\u2019s name.\nIn a copy of a document from 1341, Merzweiler is named as \"Mertzwilr\". In 1375 it was called \"Mortzwiler\", and in 1426 \"Mortzwilre\". In 1500, the form \"Mertzwiler\" appeared. The village's name, Merzweiler, has the common &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; placename ending \"\u2014weiler\", which as a standalone word means \u201c&lt;a href=\"Hamlet%20%28place%29\"&gt;hamlet&lt;/a&gt;\u201d (originally \u201chomestead\u201d), to which is prefixed a syllable \"Merz\u2014\", believed to have arisen from a personal name, \"Morizo\", suggesting that the village arose from a homestead founded by an early &lt;a href=\"Franks\"&gt;Frankish&lt;/a&gt; settler named Morizo. The earlier notion that the village already existed in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; times with the name \"Martis Villa\" (\"Martis\" being the &lt;a href=\"Genitive%20case\"&gt;genitive&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Mars%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;\", the war god, and thus this name would have meant \u201cMars\u2019s Estate\u201d) or \"Villa Mercis\" (\u201cWarehouse Estate\u201d) is not nowadays shared by regional historians.\nReligion.\nIn Merzweiler, from the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; onwards, up to the late 16th century, stood a church. Whether the village was originally a self-administering parish is unknown. In the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Late Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the church was a branch of &lt;a href=\"Medard\"&gt;Medard&lt;/a&gt;. Since the village then belonged to the Duchy of &lt;a href=\"Palatinate-Zweibr%C3%BCcken\"&gt;Palatinate-Zweibr\u00fccken&lt;/a&gt;, it was then subject to Zweibr\u00fccken ecclesiastical organization. That changed right away when Merzweiler was traded for &lt;a href=\"Bosenbach\"&gt;Bosenbach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oberstaufenbach\"&gt;Staufenbach&lt;/a&gt; in 1595, and thereby ended up with the Rhinegraviate of Grumbach. It was then subject to Rhinegravial ecclesiastical organization. Merzweiler thus belonged first to the parish of Sulzbach, then passing to the parish of Grumbach when this became self-administering in 1808. In Zweibr\u00fccken times, the clergyman would hold services during the week at the Merzweiler church, while on Sundays he would hold them at the &lt;a href=\"Kappeln%2C%20Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Kappeln&lt;/a&gt; church. About the church building itself little is known. A 1584 ecclesiastical visitation protocol noted that the church had fallen into disrepair and needed to be renovated. Obviously nothing came of this and the church was simply given up. There were never very many &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; in Merzweiler in earlier days.\nPolitics.\nMunicipal council.\nThe council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by &lt;a href=\"Plurality%20voting%20system\"&gt;majority vote&lt;/a&gt; at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\nMayor.\nMerzweiler's mayor is Klaudia Schneider.\nCoat of arms.\nThe municipality's &lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;arms&lt;/a&gt; might be described thus: Per bend sinister Or a lion rampant sinister gules armed and langued azure and gules two roses, the smaller surmounting the larger, the larger reversed, both argent and barbed vert and the smaller seeded of the first.\nThe &lt;a href=\"charge%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt; on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is the lion once borne as an heraldic device by the &lt;a href=\"Waldgrave\"&gt;Waldgrave&lt;/a&gt;s and Rhinegraves, the area's last &lt;a href=\"Feudalism\"&gt;feudal&lt;/a&gt; rulers. The roses symbolize the village's beauty, bearing witness to which are its showings in various contests. The arms have been borne since 20 July 1964 when they were approved by the &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt; Ministry of the Interior.\nCulture and sightseeing.\nBuildings.\nThe following are listed buildings or sites in &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s Directory of Cultural Monuments:\nRegular events.\nMerzweiler holds its &lt;a href=\"kermis\"&gt;kermis&lt;/a&gt; (church consecration festival) on the third weekend in August. Old customs, such as were once observed in all villages of the Glan area, are hardly practised at all nowadays.\nClubs.\nThe following clubs are active in Merzweiler:\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nEconomic structure.\nIn the time after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the number of &lt;a href=\"Agriculture\"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt; operations in Merzweiler shrank greatly, though the lands used for farming remained mostly preserved. Thus, the farms still in business simply got bigger. Primary income-earning operations mostly shifted to secondary income earners, but all together most of these businesses were reduced to a minimum. Workers therefore had to seek jobs outside the village. As mentioned above, in 1955, of the 56 active workforce members in Merzweiler, 48 had to &lt;a href=\"Commuting\"&gt;commute&lt;/a&gt; to jobs. The number of commuters has since risen.\nEducation.\nWith certainty, schoolchildren from Merzweiler were being taught even before 1595, perhaps in a neighbouring village. From 1595 to 1762, schoolchildren attended the &lt;a href=\"school\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Herren-Sulzbach\"&gt;Herren-Sulzbach&lt;/a&gt;, and thereafter the one in &lt;a href=\"Grumbach\"&gt;Grumbach&lt;/a&gt;. In 1909, the village got its own school. The schoolhouse still stands today, although the school that it housed was dissolved in 1969. The last schoolteacher was Adolf Bender. Until 2010, &lt;a href=\"primary%20school\"&gt;primary school&lt;/a&gt; pupils attended the primary school in &lt;a href=\"Grumbach\"&gt;Grumbach&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Hoppst%C3%A4dten\"&gt;Hoppst\u00e4dten&lt;/a&gt;, which has since been closed. The &lt;a href=\"Hauptschule\"&gt;Hauptschule&lt;/a&gt; students went straight to the Hauptschule in &lt;a href=\"Lauterecken\"&gt;Lauterecken&lt;/a&gt;, and now, the primary school pupils, too, are taught in Lauterecken. The \"&lt;a href=\"Gymnasium%20%28school%29\"&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/a&gt; Lauterecken\" is relatively easy to reach from Merzweiler.\nTransport.\nMerzweiler lies at a crossroads of \"&lt;a href=\"Landesstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Landesstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt;\" 373 (&lt;a href=\"Kappeln%2C%20Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Kappeln&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Langweiler%2C%20Kusel\"&gt;Langweiler&lt;/a&gt;), and \"&lt;a href=\"Kreisstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Kreisstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt;\" 53 (&lt;a href=\"Unterjeckenbach\"&gt;Unterjeckenbach&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Grumbach\"&gt;Grumbach&lt;/a&gt;). \"Kreisstra\u00dfe\" 67 towards &lt;a href=\"Hoppst%C3%A4dten\"&gt;Hoppst\u00e4dten&lt;/a&gt; also branches off here. Running to the southwest is \"&lt;a href=\"Bundesstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Bundesstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt;\" 270. Langweiler and Grumbach each lie roughly 2\u00a0km away. The nearest &lt;a href=\"Autobahn\"&gt;Autobahn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"interchange%20%28road%29\"&gt;interchange&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Kusel\"&gt;Kusel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kaiserslautern\"&gt;Kaiserslautern&lt;/a&gt; are quite far away, and can be reached only after driving 35 to 45\u00a0km. Serving &lt;a href=\"Lauterecken\"&gt;Lauterecken&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"railway%20station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt; on the \"&lt;a href=\"Lautertalbahn\"&gt;Lautertalbahn&lt;/a&gt;\"."
