    "text": "Dieglman Island is an island about long that is largely ice covered but has numerous rock outcrops, lying on the northwest side of &lt;a href=\"Edisto%20Channel\"&gt;Edisto Channel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Highjump%20Archipelago\"&gt;Highjump Archipelago&lt;/a&gt;. First mapped from air photos taken by &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Navy%20Operation%20Highjump\"&gt;U.S. Navy Operation Highjump&lt;/a&gt;, 1946\u201347, and named the \"Dieglman Islets\", subsequent Soviet expeditions (1956\u201357) mapped the feature as one island with numerous outcrops. The name has been altered by the &lt;a href=\"Advisory%20Committee%20on%20Antarctic%20Names\"&gt;Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names&lt;/a&gt; (US-ACAN) to apply to the single island. Named by US-ACAN for &lt;a href=\"E.D.%20Dieglman\"&gt;E.D. Dieglman&lt;/a&gt;, an air crewman on U.S. Navy Operation Highjump photographic flights in this area in 1946\u201347."
