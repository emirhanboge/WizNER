    "text": "Agaricus macrosporus is a rare, &lt;a href=\"edible%20mushroom\"&gt;edible mushroom&lt;/a&gt; found from June at wood fringes and in meadows.\nDescription.\nThe white &lt;a href=\"Pileus%20%28mycology%29\"&gt;cap&lt;/a&gt; is hemispherical and white when young, but later flattens out up to 25\u00a0cm in diameter and becomes yellowish or tan. Its &lt;a href=\"Trama%20%28mycology%29\"&gt;flesh&lt;/a&gt; is very thick. The &lt;a href=\"Gill%20%28mycology%29\"&gt;gills&lt;/a&gt; are pinkish grey when young, and become brown with age. The &lt;a href=\"spore\"&gt;spore&lt;/a&gt;s measure 12 by 6 &lt;a href=\"Micrometre\"&gt;\u03bcm&lt;/a&gt; and are purplish-brown and almond-shaped. The &lt;a href=\"Stipe%20%28mycology%29\"&gt;stem&lt;/a&gt; is strong and thick, with a broad ring. It may measure 8 to 12\u00a0cm in height and up to 3\u00a0cm in diameter.\nThe flesh is white with a mild taste and a smell of aniseed, turning slowly orange when cut.\nSimilar species.\nThere is a danger of confusing this mushroom with the deadly poisonous bulbous agaric \"&lt;a href=\"Amanita%20phalloides\"&gt;Amanita phalloides&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Amanita%20pantherina\"&gt;Amanita pantherina&lt;/a&gt;\". \"&lt;a href=\"Agaricus%20excellens\"&gt;Agaricus excellens&lt;/a&gt;\" is different by its taller and slimmer stipe which is striped lengthwise. \"&lt;a href=\"Agaricus%20augustus\"&gt;Agaricus augustus&lt;/a&gt;\" does not have the pure white cap in young specimens."
