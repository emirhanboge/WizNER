    "text": "USFS \"Penguin was an American &lt;a href=\"cargo%20liner\"&gt;cargo liner&lt;/a&gt; in commission in the fleet of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Fisheries\"&gt;United States Bureau of Fisheries&lt;/a&gt; from 1930 to 1940 and, as US FWS \"Penguin, in the fleet of the U.S. &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service\"&gt;Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt; from 1940 to 1950. She ran a passenger-cargo service between &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Pribilof%20Islands\"&gt;Pribilof Islands&lt;/a&gt;, and provided transportation between the two inhabited Pribilofs, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Paul%20Island%20%28Alaska%29\"&gt;Saint Paul Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St.%20George%20Island%20%28Alaska%29\"&gt;St. George Island&lt;/a&gt;. She also carried passengers, supplies, and provisions to destinations on the mainland of the &lt;a href=\"Territory%20of%20Alaska\"&gt;Territory of Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Aleutian%20Islands\"&gt;Aleutian Islands&lt;/a&gt;. She occasionally supported research activities in Alaskan waters and the North &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction and commissioning.\nOn 21 April 1910, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; assigned the responsibility for the management and harvest of &lt;a href=\"northern%20fur%20seal\"&gt;northern fur seal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es and other &lt;a href=\"fur\"&gt;fur&lt;/a&gt;-bearing animals in the &lt;a href=\"Pribilof%20Islands\"&gt;Pribilof Islands&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bering%20Sea\"&gt;Bering Sea&lt;/a&gt;, as well as for the care, education, and welfare of the &lt;a href=\"Aleut%20people\"&gt;Aleut&lt;/a&gt; communities in the islands to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Fisheries\"&gt;United States Bureau of Fisheries&lt;/a&gt; (BOF). The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior\"&gt;United States Department of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;\u2032s Fish and Wildlife Service \u2013 renamed the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service\"&gt;United States Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt; (USFWS) after a 1956 reorganization \u2013 assumed these responsibilities when it replaced the Bureau of Fisheries in 1940. Since 1917, the Bureau of Fisheries had operated a \"&lt;a href=\"Pribilof%20tender\"&gt;Pribilof tender&lt;/a&gt;,\" a dedicated supply vessel used to transport passengers and cargo to and from the Pribilof Islands.\nIn 1928, the BOF recommended the replacement of its existing Pribilof tender, the aging , with a new, larger, and more powerful vessel. The U.S. Congress appropriated US$125,000 for the construction of the new ship, which would be the largest BOF vessel to serve in the waters of the &lt;a href=\"Territory%20of%20Alaska\"&gt;Territory of Alaska&lt;/a&gt; up to that time. The &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"naval%20architect\"&gt;naval architect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Cornelius%20Hanson\"&gt;Harold Cornelius Hanson&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 who became quite fond of the ship and referred to her as the \"best wooden boat ever built\" \u2013 designed the vessel as a wooden-&lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28ship%29\"&gt;hulled&lt;/a&gt; coastal &lt;a href=\"cargo%20liner\"&gt;cargo liner&lt;/a&gt;, with a sheathed &lt;a href=\"ironbark\"&gt;ironbark&lt;/a&gt; hull that would allow her to operate in rough seas and drifting ice, twin &lt;a href=\"Propeller\"&gt;screws&lt;/a&gt; driven by twin &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s, comfortable passenger quarters below deck, a 160-ton cargo capacity, and a cruising range of . With the low bid of $89,589, the &lt;a href=\"Ballard%20Marine%20Railroad%20Company\"&gt;Ballard Marine Railroad Company&lt;/a&gt; of Seattle won the contract to construct her.\nThe first attempt to &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; the ship at &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20Bay\"&gt;Salmon Bay&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle on 7 January 1930 failed when, after she was christened with the traditional bottle of &lt;a href=\"champagne\"&gt;champagne&lt;/a&gt; broken across her &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, she did not move; the &lt;a href=\"grease%20%28lubricant%29\"&gt;grease&lt;/a&gt; used on the launching skids had frozen and the ship remained stuck in place even after two boats in the bay attempted to pull her into the water. By 8 January 1930, the grease had thawed and, with a large and enthusiastic crowd looking on, the launching ceremony was repeated and the ship slid into Salmon Bay. After &lt;a href=\"Fitting-out\"&gt;fitting out&lt;/a&gt;, the ship was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; into the BOF fleet in the spring of 1930 as USFS \"Penguin\".\nService history.\nBureau of Fisheries.\nImmediately following her commissioning, \"Penguin\" departed Seattle on 5 May 1930 to begin her first voyage to the Pribilof Islands, where she arrived on 16 May 1930, delivering 17 BOF employees and 175 tons of general cargo. In September 1930, she spent two weeks supporting &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Escapement%20%28fishing%29\"&gt;escapement&lt;/a&gt; studies in &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Alaska\"&gt;Southeast Alaska&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ketchikan%2C%20Alaska\"&gt;Ketchikan&lt;/a&gt; District. By the end of 1930, after only eight months in commission, \"Penguin\" had logged over and had proven her capability to operate in extreme weather conditions that arrived late in the year.\nCommissioner of Fisheries &lt;a href=\"Henry%20O%27Malley\"&gt;Henry O'Malley&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the chief of the BOF \u2013 and his party used \"Penguin\" for several weeks in July and August 1931 to inspect &lt;a href=\"Fishery\"&gt;fisheries&lt;/a&gt; in various parts of the Territory of Alaska, and the BOF &lt;a href=\"fishery\"&gt;fishery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"patrol%20vessel\"&gt;patrol vessel&lt;/a&gt; substituted for \"Penguin\" as the BOF\u2032s Pribilof tender during that period. In September 1932, \"Penguin\" transported three live &lt;a href=\"fur%20seal\"&gt;fur seal&lt;/a&gt;s and 19 live &lt;a href=\"rosy%20finch\"&gt;rosy finch&lt;/a&gt;es from the Pribilof Islands to Seattle, from which the animals were shipped by train to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Zoological%20Park%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Zoological Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Washington%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;; all but one male fur seal and three of the finches survived the trip.\nOn 24 January 1933, the wooden Unangan Aleut trading boat \"Umnak Native\" was anchored in &lt;a href=\"Inanudak%20Bay\"&gt;Inanudak Bay&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"Umnak\"&gt;Umnak&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Aleutian%20Islands\"&gt;Aleutian Islands&lt;/a&gt; when a violent storm struck, snapping her anchor chain, and she broke up and sank when her engine failed to start. Only four of the 15 people on board survived, including &lt;a href=\"Bishop\"&gt;Bishop&lt;/a&gt; Antonin Pokrovsky of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Russian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;. Local inhabitants on Umnak found Pokrovsky after he reached shore, but could not transport him, and the &lt;a href=\"Steamship\"&gt;steamer&lt;/a&gt; \"Starr\", although in the vicinity, lacked the charts necessary to enter the bay safely and pick him up. Pokrovsky was suffering from severe illness and frozen legs, so the BOF was asked to help, and it sent \"Penguin\", which rescued Pokrovsky on 14 February 1933.\n\"Penguin\" suffered two mishaps of her own later in 1933. On 8 August 1933, her steering gear broke while she was in &lt;a href=\"Seymour%20Narrows\"&gt;Seymour Narrows&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Discovery%20Passage\"&gt;Discovery Passage&lt;/a&gt;; strong tidal currents in the narrows endangered her, but the &lt;a href=\"halibut\"&gt;halibut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fishing%20boat\"&gt;fishing boat&lt;/a&gt; \"Bernice\" was nearby and towed her to safety so she could make repairs. On 21 September, \"Penguin\" collided with the vessel \"Tuscan\" about southeast of Ketchikan, then towed the damaged \"Tuscan\" to Ketchikan; \"Tuscan\"s owners later filed a claim for US$6,800 claim in damages against the BOF, but a trial six months later resulted in dismissal of the claim when \"Tuscan\"s owners could not prove negligence on the part of \"Penguin\".\nIn 1934, \"Penguin\" transported &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Post%20Office\"&gt;United States Post Office&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Steamboat%20Inspection%20Service\"&gt;Steamboat Inspection Service&lt;/a&gt; personnel to various destinations along the coast of the Territory of Alaska. In 1936, a &lt;a href=\"fathometer\"&gt;fathometer&lt;/a&gt; was installed aboard \"Penguin\" which allowed her to navigate more safely in Alaskan waters and especially in the poorly charted waters of the &lt;a href=\"Aleutian%20Islands\"&gt;Aleutian Islands&lt;/a&gt;. After the BOF established a field station on &lt;a href=\"Amchitka\"&gt;Amchitka&lt;/a&gt; in the western Aleutians in 1937 to expand the study and protection of &lt;a href=\"sea%20otter\"&gt;sea otter&lt;/a&gt;s, \"Penguin\" began making voyages to Amchitka to transport construction materials, construction workers, supplies, and cargo for the construction and maintenance of the station.\nA case of &lt;a href=\"measles\"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; was discovered aboard \"Penguin\" while she was at &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Paul%20Island%20%28Alaska%29\"&gt;Saint Paul Island&lt;/a&gt; in the Pribilofs on 1 July 1939, and she underwent a two-week &lt;a href=\"quarantine\"&gt;quarantine&lt;/a&gt;. In 1940, \"Penguin\"s crew assisted the staff at the Amchitka field station with electrical repairs, power plant servicing, and the installation of a &lt;a href=\"Radio%20telephone\"&gt;radio-telephone&lt;/a&gt; transmitter and &lt;a href=\"Antenna%20%28radio%29\"&gt;antennae&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to these activities, \"Penguin\" continued her regular schedule of voyages between Seattle and the Pribilof Islands, bringing passengers and provisions to the islands and transporting them between the two inhabited Pribilofs, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Paul%20Island%20%28Alaska%29\"&gt;Saint Paul Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St.%20George%20Island%20%28Alaska%29\"&gt;St. George Island&lt;/a&gt;. During the 1930s, the annual take of &lt;a href=\"sealskin\"&gt;sealskin&lt;/a&gt;s at the Pribilofs increased significantly, and by 1940 reached an annual total of 64,864, the most taken in 50 years. &lt;a href=\"Fox\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt; pelts also were an important export from the Pribilofs; in the December 1938\u2013January 1939 trapping season alone, 1,029 fox pelts were also taken on the islands. Byproducts from &lt;a href=\"Seal%20hunting\"&gt;sealing&lt;/a&gt; operations produced at a plant on Saint Paul Island \u2013 consisting in 1939 of nearly 28,000 US gallons (514 &lt;a href=\"Barrel%20%28unit%29\"&gt;barrels&lt;/a&gt;; 105,592 liters) of seal blubber oil, 4,789 gallons of seal carcass oil; and 338,421 pounds of seal meal \u2013 also were exported. \"Penguin\" and military vessels transported all these goods to Seattle. From there, the skins went by rail to &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, for processing and &lt;a href=\"public%20auction\"&gt;public auction&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Fouke%20Fur%20Company\"&gt;Fouke Fur Company&lt;/a&gt;, while the BOF\u2032s Division of &lt;a href=\"Fish%20culture\"&gt;Fish Culture&lt;/a&gt; acquired 75 tons of the seal meal for use as &lt;a href=\"Fish%20hatchery\"&gt;hatchery&lt;/a&gt; fish food across the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the seal meal was sold at auction.\nFish and Wildlife Service.\nIn 1939, the Bureau of Fisheries was transferred from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Commerce\"&gt;United States Department of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior\"&gt;United States Department of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;, and on 30 June 1940, it merged with the Interior Department's Division of Biological Survey to form the new &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service\"&gt;Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt; (FWS) as an element of the Interior Department. Via this reorganization, \"Penguin\" became part of the fleet of the new FWS in 1940.\nAs the threat of war with &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; grew, \"Penguin\" was transferred from the FWS to the U.S. Navy in 1941 for special duty, and she arrived at &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Harbor%2C%20Alaska\"&gt;Dutch Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Amaknak%20Island\"&gt;Amaknak Island&lt;/a&gt; in the Aleutian Islands in early 1942 to resume her voyages to the Pribilofs. During 1942, she transported supplies, provisions, and equipment to an &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Funter%20Bay\"&gt;Funter Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Alaska, in preparation for the evacuation of the Aleut population from the Pribilof Islands to the camp.\nBetween 1947 and 1949, \"Penguin\" conducted cruises involving the study of &lt;a href=\"albatross\"&gt;albatross&lt;/a&gt;es that took her as far as the western tip of the Aleutian Island chain, across the &lt;a href=\"North%20Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;North Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, and as far south as &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. By 1948, she was logging an average of almost per year.\nOn the night of 3 June 1950, \"Penguin\" was moored at the FWS dock in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Union\"&gt;Lake Union&lt;/a&gt; at Seattle when a fire destroyed her &lt;a href=\"Superstructure%20%28ship%29\"&gt;superstructure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cabin%20%28ship%29\"&gt;cabins&lt;/a&gt;. Her hull was saved, but the FWS concluded that the cost of repairs \u2013 originally estimated at between US$15,000 and US$20,000, but later at US$75,000 \u2013 was higher than the cost of purchasing a replacement vessel. With \"Penguin\" at the time of the fire scheduled to depart for the Pribilofs with much-needed supplies on 13 June 1950, her replacement was a matter of some urgency, so the FWS retired her from service and on 9 June 1950 purchased the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; coastal cargo ship \"Lt. Raymond Zussman\" and placed her in service as its new Pribilof tender immediately. \"Lt. Raymond Zussman\" departed Seattle for her first voyage to the Pribilofs on 17 June 1950, only four days later than \"Penguin\"s scheduled departure. During the summer of 1950, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior\"&gt;United States Secretary of the Interior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20L.%20Chapman\"&gt;Oscar L. Chapman&lt;/a&gt; announced that \"Lt. Raymond Zussman\" would undergo a name change, saying, \"The goodwill built up for 20 years in the name of the \"Penguin\" will not be lost...the vessel's successor has been named \"Penguin II\".\" Accordingly, the FWS formally renamed its new Pribilof tender in honor of \"Penguin\" on 21 September 1950.\nLater career.\nThe FWS sold the damaged \"Penguin\" at auction to Tom Farrell and Russ Gibson of Seattle for US$25,778 on 21 March 1951. Believing she could be repaired and returned to service, her designer, H. C. Hanson, obtained her and completely rebuilt her, also installing new wiring and equipment during her reconstruction.\nThe H. O. Merren Company of the &lt;a href=\"Cayman%20Island\"&gt;Cayman Island&lt;/a&gt;s bought \"Penguin\" in 1957, registered her under the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ensign\"&gt;British flag&lt;/a&gt;, renamed her \"Carib Queen\", and based her at &lt;a href=\"Georgetown%2C%20Cayman%20Islands\"&gt;Georgetown&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cayman%20Islands\"&gt;Cayman Islands&lt;/a&gt;. H. O. Merren used her to transport tourists from &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; to H. O. Merren's resort in the Caymans."
