    "text": "K. C. Jones (May 25, 1932 \u2013 December 25, 2020) was an American professional &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; player and coach. He is best known for his association with the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Celtics\"&gt;Boston Celtics&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt; (NBA), with whom he won 11 of his 12 &lt;a href=\"NBA%20championship\"&gt;NBA championship&lt;/a&gt;s (eight as a player, one as an assistant coach, and two as a head coach). As a player, he is tied for third for most NBA championships in a career, and is one of three NBA players with an 8\u20130 record in NBA Finals series. He is the only African-American coach other than &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Russell\"&gt;Bill Russell&lt;/a&gt; to have won multiple NBA championships. Jones was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Naismith%20Memorial%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 1989.\nEarly life.\nJones was born in &lt;a href=\"Taylor%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Taylor, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, as the oldest of six children. The initials \"K. C.\" were his given name; he inherited the same name as his father, a factory worker and cook, who himself was named after the fabled railroad engineer &lt;a href=\"Casey%20Jones\"&gt;Casey Jones&lt;/a&gt;. When Jones was aged nine, his parents divorced and he moved to &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2C%20California\"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt;, with his mother and two siblings. He learned to play basketball on a patch of gravel.\nJones attended Commerce High School in San Francisco where he played basketball and &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nJones played &lt;a href=\"college%20basketball\"&gt;college basketball&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20San%20Francisco\"&gt;University of San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; and, along with &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Russell\"&gt;Bill Russell&lt;/a&gt;, guided the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Dons%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Dons&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; championships in 1955 and 1956. During their time with the Dons, Russell and Jones led the team to a then-record 55-game win streak (including an undefeated 29\u20130 record during the &lt;a href=\"1955%E2%80%9356%20NCAA%20men%27s%20basketball%20season\"&gt;1955\u201356 season&lt;/a&gt;) and helped pioneer a play that later became known as the &lt;a href=\"Alley-oop%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;alley-oop&lt;/a&gt;.\nJones also played with Russell on &lt;a href=\"1956%20United%20States%20men%27s%20Olympic%20basketball%20team\"&gt;the United States national team&lt;/a&gt; which won the gold medal at the &lt;a href=\"Basketball%20at%20the%201956%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1956 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, Australia, while defeating their opponents by an unsurpassed average margin of 53.5 points per game.\nAfter completing college and joining the NBA, Jones considered a career as an &lt;a href=\"NFL\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; player, even trying out for a team. However, he failed to make the cut. During his playing days, he was known as a tenacious defender. Jones spent all of his nine seasons in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Celtics\"&gt;Boston Celtics&lt;/a&gt;, being part of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20NBA%20players%20with%20most%20championships\"&gt;eight championship teams&lt;/a&gt; from 1959 to 1966, retiring after the Celtics' loss to the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%2076ers\"&gt;Philadelphia 76ers&lt;/a&gt; in the 1967 Eastern Division Finals. He was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Naismith%20Memorial%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 1989.\nJones is one of only eight players in basketball history to have won an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal, joining &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Russell\"&gt;Bill Russell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Johnson\"&gt;Magic Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Jordan\"&gt;Michael Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Lucas\"&gt;Jerry Lucas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20Lovellette\"&gt;Clyde Lovellette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quinn%20Buckner\"&gt;Quinn Buckner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Davis\"&gt;Anthony Davis&lt;/a&gt;. In NBA history, only his former teammates Russell (11 championships) and &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Jones%20%28basketball%2C%20born%201933%29\"&gt;Sam Jones&lt;/a&gt; (10) have won more championships during their playing careers.\nCoaching career.\nJones began his coaching career at &lt;a href=\"Brandeis%20University\"&gt;Brandeis University&lt;/a&gt;, serving as its head coach from 1967 to 1970. He served as an assistant coach at &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; from 1970 to 1971. Jones then reunited with former teammate &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Sharman\"&gt;Bill Sharman&lt;/a&gt; as the assistant coach for the 1971\u201372 NBA champion &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Lakers\"&gt;Los Angeles Lakers&lt;/a&gt;. During that season, the team won a record 33 straight games. He became the first-ever head coach of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;ABA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Conquistadors\"&gt;San Diego Conquistadors&lt;/a&gt; on August 8, 1972.\nOne week after Jones' only season with the Conquistadors ended with his resignation, he signed a three\u2010year contract to succeed &lt;a href=\"Gene%20Shue\"&gt;Gene Shue&lt;/a&gt; in a similar capacity with the &lt;a href=\"1973%E2%80%9374%20Capital%20Bullets%20season\"&gt;Capital Bullets&lt;/a&gt; (name changed to &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Wizards\"&gt;Washington Bullets&lt;/a&gt; beginning in &lt;a href=\"1974%E2%80%9375%20Washington%20Bullets%20season\"&gt;1974\u201375&lt;/a&gt;) on June 18, 1973. During his three years in Washington, the Bullets had a 155\u201391 win\u2010loss record and arguably the most talented team in the league. Being swept by the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20State%20Warriors\"&gt;Golden State Warriors&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1975%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;1975 NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt; and a seven-game loss to the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Cavaliers\"&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1976%20NBA%20playoffs\"&gt;Eastern Conference Semifinals the following year&lt;/a&gt; resulted in Jones' contract not being renewed on May 7, 1976. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Motta\"&gt;Dick Motta&lt;/a&gt; three weeks later on May 28, 1976.\nIn 1983, Jones took over as head coach of the Boston Celtics, replacing &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Fitch\"&gt;Bill Fitch&lt;/a&gt;. Jones guided the &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Bird\"&gt;Larry Bird&lt;/a&gt;-led Celtics to championships in 1984 and 1986. Also in 1986, Jones led the Eastern squad in the &lt;a href=\"1986%20NBA%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1986 NBA All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dallas\"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Reunion%20Arena\"&gt;Reunion Arena&lt;/a&gt;, beating the Western squad 139\u2013132. The Celtics won the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Division%20%28NBA%29\"&gt;Atlantic Division&lt;/a&gt; in all five of Jones's seasons as head coach and reached the NBA Finals in four of his five years as coach. In a surprise announcement, he retired after the 1987\u201388 season and was succeeded by assistant coach &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Rodgers%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Jimmy Rodgers&lt;/a&gt;. Jones spent one season in the Celtics' front office in 1988\u201389, then resigned to join the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20SuperSonics\"&gt;Seattle SuperSonics&lt;/a&gt; as an assistant coach and basketball consultant for the 1989\u201390 season. He served as head coach of the Sonics in 1990\u201391 and 1991\u201392.\nIn 1994, Jones joined the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Pistons\"&gt;Detroit Pistons&lt;/a&gt; as an assistant coach for one season. The Pistons' head coach at that time, &lt;a href=\"Don%20Chaney\"&gt;Don Chaney&lt;/a&gt;, had previously played for Jones with the Celtics. Jones was also considered to once again coach the Celtics during the off-season in 1995. In 1996, Jones returned to the Boston Celtics, this time as an assistant coach for one season.\nJones returned to the professional coaching ranks in 1997, guiding the &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20Blizzard\"&gt;New England Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; of the fledgling women's &lt;a href=\"American%20Basketball%20League%20%281996%E2%80%931998%29\"&gt;American Basketball League&lt;/a&gt; (1996\u20131998) through its last 1\u00bd seasons of existence. The Blizzard made the playoffs in his second year as head coach, but they were summarily dispatched by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20Lasers\"&gt;San Jose Lasers&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nJones married Beverly Cain \u2013 the sister of his Olympic teammate &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Cain\"&gt;Carl Cain&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 in 1959; they had five children together before they divorced. He had a sixth child when he remarried to Ellen. His son, Kipper, played as a guard at &lt;a href=\"Bentley%20College\"&gt;Bentley College&lt;/a&gt;. His daughter, Bryna, received a basketball and volleyball scholarship to attend the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;University of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nJones died on December 25, 2020, at an assisted living center in Connecticut, aged 88. He had &lt;a href=\"Alzheimer%27s%20disease\"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.\nNBA career statistics.\nSource:\nHead coaching record.\nSource:"
