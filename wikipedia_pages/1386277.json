He also represented the &lt;a href=\"Belgium%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Belgium national team&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilmots has also been a politician, having sat in the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; for four years for the &lt;a href=\"Mouvement%20R%C3%A9formateur\"&gt;Mouvement R\u00e9formateur&lt;/a&gt; party.\nClub career.\nIn his club career, which started in 1987, Wilmots played for &lt;a href=\"K.%20Sint-Truidense%20V.V.\"&gt;Sint-Truiden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KV%20Mechelen\"&gt;Mechelen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Standard Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Schalke%2004\"&gt;Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;. At Schalke, he helped them to the &lt;a href=\"1997%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1997 UEFA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;. His goal in the first leg was cancelled out by &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Internazionale&lt;/a&gt; in the second leg, but Schalke went on to win the game on penalties, with Wilmots scoring the decisive goal. He retired in 2003, after his second stint with Schalke. During his time with Schalke, the fans there gave him the affectionate nickname \"Das Kampfschwein\" (The War Pig), which has been picked up by some English language journalists. In Belgium he is known under the nickname the \"Bull of Dongelberg\", an allusion to his birthplace.\nInternational career.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Belgium%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, Wilmots scored 28 goals in 70 &lt;a href=\"Cap%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;caps&lt;/a&gt;, his first coming in May 1990. He went to four &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cups&lt;/a&gt;, playing in three. After being an unused substitute in &lt;a href=\"1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;, he played 54 minutes in &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt; without scoring, but scored two goals in &lt;a href=\"1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; and three in &lt;a href=\"2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, making him Belgium's leading goal scorer in World Cup history. He also scored a goal against Brazil in the last 16 match of the 2002 World Cup which was disallowed because of a \"phantom foul\" on &lt;a href=\"Roque%20J%C3%BAnior\"&gt;Roque J\u00fanior&lt;/a&gt;. According to Wilmots, the referee &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Prendergast%20%28referee%29\"&gt;Peter Prendergast&lt;/a&gt; apologized for the error to him at half time. Wilmots was named as one of the seven reserves in the 2002 &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup%20awards%23All-Star%20Team\"&gt;World Cup All-Star Team&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilmots also played in &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202000\"&gt;Euro 2000&lt;/a&gt;, when Belgium co-hosted the tournament.\nManagerial career.\nWilmots became a football manager in summer 2004 for &lt;a href=\"Sint-Truidense%20V.V.\"&gt;Sint-Truiden&lt;/a&gt;, but was sacked in February 2005. Between 2009 and 2012, he served as &lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28sport%29\"&gt;assistant manager&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Belgium%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Belgium national team&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Advocaat\"&gt;Dick Advocaat&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Leekens\"&gt;Georges Leekens&lt;/a&gt;. On 15 May 2012, following the exit of Leekens, Wilmots assumed the Belgium reins on an interim basis before going onto become permanent coach, signing a contract until June 2014.\nOn 11 October 2013, Belgium qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2014 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Wilmots is credited with \"not only giving the young group confidence in themselves as well as enjoying a close relationship with his players but also at the same time being capable of instilling discipline to the squad.\" During the group stage, Belgium topped the group with all three wins, before exiting the tournament at the quarter-final stage.\nOn 13 October 2015, Belgium won the group to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202016\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2016&lt;/a&gt; in the last game of the stage against &lt;a href=\"Israel%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Israel.&lt;/a&gt; After a disappointing European Championship, Wilmots was fired by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Belgian%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Royal Belgian Football Association&lt;/a&gt; on 15 July 2016.\nIn March 2017 Wilmots was appointed as the manager of &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Coast%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ivory Coast national team&lt;/a&gt;. However he was sacked from his position six months later after failing to qualify for the World Cup.\nOn 15 May 2019, Wilmots agreed a three years contract to become the manager of the &lt;a href=\"Iran%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Iranian national team&lt;/a&gt;, after Portuguese coach &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Queiroz\"&gt;Carlos Queiroz&lt;/a&gt; left the team after eight years in charge following Iran's semifinal exit in the Asian Cup. He officially signed his contract on 29 May, effective from 1 June 2019. On 4 December 2019, he left his role as Iran coach.\nOn 11 November 2021, Moroccan team &lt;a href=\"Raja%20CA\"&gt;Raja CA&lt;/a&gt; announced that Wilmots would be their new head coach until 2024, succeeding &lt;a href=\"Lassaad%20Chabbi\"&gt;Lassaad Chabbi&lt;/a&gt;. \nPolitical career.\nAfter retiring as a footballer, Wilmots went into politics. He was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; for the French-speaking conservative party, the &lt;a href=\"Mouvement%20R%C3%A9formateur\"&gt;Reformist Movement&lt;/a&gt; (\"Mouvement R\u00e9formateur\" or MR) in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Belgian%20federal%20election\"&gt;2003 federal election&lt;/a&gt;. He received 79,437 votes, a number surpassed only by 17 other candidates in the whole country during the elections.\nHis political career is not considered very successful. In 2005, he announced that he wanted to resign as a senator, a rather unconventional and criticized constitutional move.\nHonours.\nPlayer.\nKV Mechelen\nStandard Li\u00e8ge\nSchalke 04\nBelgium"
