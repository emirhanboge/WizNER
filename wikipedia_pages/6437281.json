    "text": "Carmen Mar\u00eda Argibay (15 June 1939 \u2013 10 May 2014) was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Argentina\"&gt;Supreme Court of Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. She was the first woman to be nominated for the Court by a democratic government in Argentina, and caused some controversy upon declaring herself an &lt;a href=\"atheism\"&gt;atheist&lt;/a&gt; and a supporter of legal &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, Argibay studied at the Law Faculty of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;University of Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a lawyer on 11 June 1964. She worked in a number of public judicial offices and taught in several universities, until 1976. On 24 March of that year, a &lt;a href=\"coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt; started the dictatorship of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Reorganization%20Process\"&gt;National Reorganization Process&lt;/a&gt;. The military junta had her arrested, without formal charges, and held her in prison until December. After being released she devoted herself to private law practice.\nAfter the return of democratic rule, on 7 June 1984, she was appointed judge in a criminal court in Buenos Aires. She was promoted in 1988 and again in 1993, and finally retired from her post on 1 January 2002.\nArgibay is a member of the International Association of Penal Law, and a founding member of the International Association of Woman Judges, over which she presided from 1998 to 2000. She also founded the Association of Woman Judges of Argentina.\nShe took part as a judge in the &lt;a href=\"Women%E2%80%99s%20International%20War%20Crimes%20Tribunal%20on%20Japan%E2%80%99s%20Military%20Sexual%20Slavery\"&gt;Women\u2019s International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan\u2019s Military Sexual Slavery&lt;/a&gt;, which gathered in December 2000 to try Japanese military for &lt;a href=\"war%20crime\"&gt;war crime&lt;/a&gt;s, particularly on the issue of \"&lt;a href=\"comfort%20women\"&gt;comfort women&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn June 2001 she was appointed \"&lt;a href=\"ad%20litem\"&gt;ad litem&lt;/a&gt;\" judge at the &lt;a href=\"International%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20former%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; (ICTY).\nNomination to the Supreme Court.\nArgibay was one of the first Justices who entered the Argentine Supreme Court when &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Argentina\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%C3%A9stor%20Kirchner\"&gt;N\u00e9stor Kirchner&lt;/a&gt; started to push for its renewal. She was proposed by the President, for the consideration of professional circles and of the public at large, on 30 December 2003. The &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Senate\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; approved her designation on 7 July 2004. She became a member of the Court on 3 February 2005, once she was able to step down from her duties at the ICTY. She was the first woman ever nominated by a democratic government for a post of the highest court of law of Argentina (&lt;a href=\"Elena%20Highton\"&gt;Elena Highton&lt;/a&gt;, the second, was nominated afterwards, but entered the Court earlier).\nArgibay's nomination met resistance from some sectors of society, particularly &lt;a href=\"conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; sectors of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, after she went on record stating that she was (politically) \"more &lt;a href=\"left-wing%20politics\"&gt;left&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href=\"right-wing%20politics\"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt;\", a \"militant &lt;a href=\"atheism\"&gt;atheist&lt;/a&gt;\", and supported \"&lt;a href=\"pro-choice\"&gt;the right of women to decide about their own bodies&lt;/a&gt;\". Most Argentinians are religious, and 85% are nominally Roman Catholic; abortion was illegal at that time &lt;a href=\"abortion%20in%20Argentina\"&gt;in Argentina&lt;/a&gt; in most cases.\nWhen the nomination was made public, a number of conservative voices criticized her for her atheism and her stance on abortion; a Catholic organization complained that Argibay, who is single and childless, was \"not representative of Argentine women.\" To these criticisms, Argibay replied, \"I believe that saying up front who one is or what one thinks is an indication of honesty, which is the first step towards impartiality. My beliefs, or lack thereof, should not interfere in the judicial decisions I take.\"\nArgibay was awarded the 2007 &lt;a href=\"Gruber%20Prize%20for%20Justice\"&gt;Gruber Prize for Justice&lt;/a&gt; (shared with Chilean judge Carlos Cerda and Peruvian lawyer &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B3nica%20Feria%20Tinta\"&gt;M\u00f3nica Feria Tinta&lt;/a&gt;) for her promotion of gender equality and eliminating corruption within the justice system.\nShe died on 10 May 2014 after suffering respiratory, cardiac and intestinal problems."
