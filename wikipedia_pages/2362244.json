At 12, he moved to Culter Boys' Club then at 14, to Albion Boys' Club.\nIt was revealed in 2013, that as a youngster Maloney had played tennis regularly against future World Number 1, &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Murray\"&gt;Andy Murray&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nCeltic.\nAfter joining &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"trainee\"&gt;trainee&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, Maloney made his first team debut on 29 April 2001 against &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ibrox%20Stadium\"&gt;Ibrox Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, in a 3\u20130 win for Celtic. He spent the next few years trying to break into the first team, spending most of his time as a &lt;a href=\"Substitute%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;substitute&lt;/a&gt;. Despite not playing regularly, Maloney acquired a reputation for being a free kick specialist. Maloney did appear several times for Celtic during their run to the UEFA Cup Final in 2003, and scored in a 3\u20131 win over &lt;a href=\"VfB%20Stuttgart\"&gt;VfB Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; at Parkhead in the Round of 16.\nIn February 2004, Maloney picked up a &lt;a href=\"cruciate%20ligament\"&gt;cruciate ligament&lt;/a&gt; injury. He returned from the injury late in &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20Celtic%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;season 2004\u201305&lt;/a&gt;, starting only one game in that season.\nMaloney hit top form for Celtic in the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Celtic%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2005\u201306 season&lt;/a&gt;, after being moved from a striking position to the left of midfield by manager &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Strachan\"&gt;Gordon Strachan&lt;/a&gt;. His displays received praise from players, fans and the media throughout the year, and in recognition of his excellent season he was awarded both the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20PFA%20Players%27%20Player%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;SPFA Player of the Year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PFA%20Scotland%20Young%20Player%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Young Player of the Year&lt;/a&gt; awards, the first time a player has won both plaudits in the same season. He also won Celtic Fans' Player of the Year, and Players Player of the Year in a season which saw him score 16 goals and contribute 28 assists from midfield.\nWith his contract expiring at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Celtic%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2006\u201307 season&lt;/a&gt;, Celtic moved to offer Maloney a new deal. However, contract negotiations continued for months, constantly breaking down due to differences between the two parties. Chief Executive &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Lawwell\"&gt;Peter Lawwell&lt;/a&gt; asserted that Celtic \"cannot keep players at any cost\" while Maloney warned that \"In situations like this one, both parties have to be completely happy with the outcome.\" He also promised that the prolonged contract talks would not affect his football and that he hoped he would not have to consider leaving the club in the future.\nMaloney would have been able to leave Celtic for free in the summer of 2007, by signing a pre-contract agreement with another club. No new contract was agreed with Celtic, and they subsequently agreed a \u00a31\u00a0million transfer to Aston Villa. In his first tenure, Maloney made a total of 139 appearances for the Hoops in all competitions, scoring 37 times.\nAston Villa.\nJust before the &lt;a href=\"transfer%20window\"&gt;transfer window&lt;/a&gt; closed on 31 January 2007, Maloney signed a pre-contract agreement with Aston Villa. Villa manager &lt;a href=\"Martin%20O%27Neill\"&gt;Martin O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;, who managed him at Celtic, was keen to bring Maloney to Villa for the second half of the season however and moments before the deadline he signed for the Midlands club for a reported fee of \u00a31\u00a0million. He made his debut in the 2\u20130 defeat at &lt;a href=\"Reading%20F.C.\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt; on 10 February 2007 On 28 April 2007, Maloney scored his first Villa goal in a victory against &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Man City&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Manchester%20Stadium\"&gt;City of Manchester Stadium&lt;/a&gt; from a free kick which was curled around the wall into the bottom right of the goal.\nMaloney had trouble settling into the club but after a somewhat lacklustre start to his Villa career, he began to show his best form. Maloney has acknowledged that his football had been suffering but remained optimistic about his future at the club: \"Homesickness has affected my form. I haven't played well enough to play in the team and I think that has shown, so hopefully now things can change.\" Both O'Neill and teammate &lt;a href=\"Stiliyan%20Petrov\"&gt;Stiliyan Petrov&lt;/a&gt;, who were both at Celtic during Maloney's time there, had expressed their desire for Maloney to stay at the club despite reports linking him with a move back to Scotland.\nMaloney scored a brace for Aston Villa in a 4\u20134 draw with Chelsea at &lt;a href=\"Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;Stamford Bridge&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Boxing%20Day\"&gt;Boxing Day&lt;/a&gt; 2007. However, after that Maloney did not play a lot of matches as half of his last season appearances were substitutions, and he also said that he would like to one day go back and play in Scotland.\nReturn to Celtic.\nOn 22 August 2008, &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; announced the signing of Maloney on a four-year deal for a fee of \u00a33\u00a0million. Maloney marked his return with a Man of the Match performance and two assists in his first match, after coming off the bench for &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Vennegoor%20of%20Hesselink\"&gt;Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink&lt;/a&gt; in a 3\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"Falkirk%20F.C.\"&gt;Falkirk&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Park\"&gt;Celtic Park&lt;/a&gt;. Maloney scored his first goal after his return to Celtic in a 4\u20132 away win over &lt;a href=\"Motherwell%20F.C.\"&gt;Motherwell&lt;/a&gt; and managed his second the following week in a 3\u20131 away win at &lt;a href=\"Kilmarnock%20F.C.\"&gt;Kilmarnock&lt;/a&gt;. He finished the season with five goals, taking his total Celtic goals tally to 42.\nUnder new manager &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Mowbray\"&gt;Tony Mowbray&lt;/a&gt;, Maloney played in 17 of Celtic's first 18 fixtures of season 2009\u201310. However he began having trouble with his &lt;a href=\"Achilles%20tendon\"&gt;Achilles tendon&lt;/a&gt; after the 2\u20131 defeat against Rangers on 4 October 2009. Maloney played a further four matches after that, but was substituted at half-time in Celtic's League Cup defeat against Hearts. It was revealed he was suffering from &lt;a href=\"Achilles%20tendinitis\"&gt;Achilles tendinitis&lt;/a&gt;, and he did not play another game that season.\nMaloney started the 2010\u201311 season in good form with goals against &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hearts&lt;/a&gt; and a brace against &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Academical%20F.C.\"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;. After this run of form, Maloney was given the short-term captaincy of Celtic in the absence of &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%20June%201985%29\"&gt;Scott Brown&lt;/a&gt; through injury. However, fitness problems flared up again for Maloney in November 2010 when he injured his ankle during a league match against &lt;a href=\"Inverness%20Caledonian%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Inverness CT&lt;/a&gt;.

He struggled to break into the first team, appearing three times as a substitute during the first half of the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2011\u201312 season&lt;/a&gt;. Maloney admitted his fitness \"was lacking a little bit\" when he joined the club, and manager &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Mart%C3%ADnez\"&gt;Roberto Mart\u00ednez&lt;/a&gt; felt that Maloney needed more time to settle-in. On 11 March 2012, he made his first Premier League appearance in almost five months, coming on as a substitute against &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Norwich City&lt;/a&gt;. His performance was described as \"outstanding\", and he was rewarded with his first league start for the club in the following game against &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt;. On 24 March 2012, he scored a penalty against &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Anfield\"&gt;Anfield&lt;/a&gt; in a 1\u20132 win for Wigan \u2013 his first goal for the club.

Six days later, on 13 April 2013, Maloney scored Wigan Athletic's first goal in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-final at &lt;a href=\"Wembley\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20F.C.\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt;, with a volley on the 25th minute and was voted man of the match, guiding Wigan Athletic to their first ever &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;.
