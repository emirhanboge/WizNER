She says that growing up in a dysfunctional family was difficult, but that growing up in a non-patriarchal environment had a beneficial impact on her. Having grown up without her father, she met her half-brothers for the first time when she was in her mid-twenties.\nShafak added her mother's first name\u2014 Turkish for \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3A%C5%9Fafak\"&gt;dawn&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2014to her own when constructing her pen name at the age of eighteen.

She depicts the city as a melting pot of different cultures and various contradictions. Shafak has remarked: \"Istanbul makes one comprehend, perhaps not intellectually but intuitively, that &lt;a href=\"East%E2%80%93West%20dichotomy\"&gt;East and West&lt;/a&gt; are ultimately imaginary concepts, and can thereby be de-imagined and re-imagined.\" In the same essay written for \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine Shafak says: \"East and West is no water and oil. They do mix. And in a city like Istanbul they mix intensely, incessantly, amazingly.\" \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times%20Book%20Review\"&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/a&gt;\" said of Shafak, \"she has a particular genius for depicting backstreet Istanbul, where the myriad cultures of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; are still in tangled evidence on every family tree.\"\nIn a piece she wrote for the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, Shafak said, \"Istanbul is like a huge, colourful &lt;a href=\"Matryoshka%20doll\"&gt;Matrushka&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 you open it and find another doll inside. You open that, only to see a new doll nesting. It is a hall of mirrors where nothing is quite what it seems. One should be cautious when using categories to talk about Istanbul. If there is one thing the city doesn't like, it is clich\u00e9s.\"\nEastern and Western cultures.\nShafak blends &lt;a href=\"East%E2%80%93West%20dichotomy\"&gt;Eastern and Western&lt;/a&gt; ways of storytelling, and draws on &lt;a href=\"Oral%20tradition\"&gt;oral&lt;/a&gt; and written culture. In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Charles%20%28critic%29\"&gt;Ron Charles&lt;/a&gt; says, \"Shafak speaks in a multivalent voice that captures the roiling tides of diverse cultures.\" &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; and specifically &lt;a href=\"Sufism\"&gt;Sufism&lt;/a&gt; has also been a theme in her work, particularly in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Forty%20Rules%20of%20Love\"&gt;The Forty Rules of Love&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFeminism.\nA &lt;a href=\"Feminism\"&gt;feminist&lt;/a&gt; and advocate for &lt;a href=\"gender%20equality\"&gt;gender equality&lt;/a&gt;, Shafak's writing has addressed numerous feminist issues and the role of women in society. Examples include motherhood and &lt;a href=\"violence%20against%20women\"&gt;violence against women&lt;/a&gt;. In an interview with William Skidelsky for \"The Guardian\", she said: \"In Turkey, men write and women read. I want to see this change.\"\nHuman rights.\nShafak's novels have explored &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; issues, particularly &lt;a href=\"Human%20rights%20in%20Turkey\"&gt;those in Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. She has said \"What literature tries to do is to re-humanize people who have been dehumanized\u00a0... People whose voices we never hear. That's a big part of my work\". Specific topics have included &lt;a href=\"persecution%20of%20Yazidis\"&gt;persecution of Yazidis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20genocide\"&gt;Armenian genocide&lt;/a&gt; and the treatment of various &lt;a href=\"minorities%20in%20Turkey\"&gt;minorities in Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.\nViews.\nFreedom of speech.\nShafak is an advocate for &lt;a href=\"freedom%20of%20expression\"&gt;freedom of expression&lt;/a&gt;. While taking part in the Free Speech Debate, she commented, \"I am more interested in showing the things we have in common as fellow human beings, sharing the same planet and ultimately, the same sorrows and joys rather than adding yet another brick in the imaginary walls erected between cultures/religions/ethnicities.\"\nPolitical views.\nShafak has been critical of the &lt;a href=\"Presidency%20of%20Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan\"&gt;presidency&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan\"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan&lt;/a&gt;, describing his tenure as leading to increased &lt;a href=\"authoritarianism\"&gt;authoritarianism&lt;/a&gt; in Turkey. She signed an open letter in protest against &lt;a href=\"Censorship%20of%20Twitter%23Turkey\"&gt;Turkey's Twitter ban&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, commenting: \"the very core of &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0... is lacking in today's Turkey\".\nShafak has spoken and written about various global political trends. In the 2010s, she drew parallels between &lt;a href=\"Politics%20of%20Turkey\"&gt;Turkish political history&lt;/a&gt; and political developments in Europe and the United States. Writing in \"The New Yorker\" in 2016, she said \"Wave after wave of nationalism, &lt;a href=\"isolationism\"&gt;isolationism&lt;/a&gt;, and tribalism have hit the shores of countries across Europe, and they have reached the United States. Jingoism and xenophobia are on the rise. It is an Age of Angst\u2014and it is a short step from angst to anger and from anger to aggression.\"\nShafak signed an open letter in protest against Russian &lt;a href=\"LGBT%20rights%20in%20Russia\"&gt;persecution of homosexuals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy%20law%20in%20Russia\"&gt;blasphemy laws&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"Sochi%20Winter%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Sochi 2014&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nShafak has lived in &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, and in the United States\u2014in &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arizona\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;\u2014before moving to the &lt;a href=\"UK\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. Shafak has lived in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; since 2013, but speaks of \"carrying Istanbul in her soul\". As of 2019, Shafak had been in self-imposed &lt;a href=\"exile\"&gt;exile&lt;/a&gt; from Turkey due to fear of prosecution.\nShafak is married to the Turkish journalist &lt;a href=\"Ey%C3%BCp%20Can%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;Ey\u00fcp Can Sa\u011fl\u0131k&lt;/a&gt;, a former editor of the newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Radikal\"&gt;Radikal&lt;/a&gt;\", with whom she has a daughter and a son. In 2017, Shafak came out as &lt;a href=\"bisexual\"&gt;bisexual&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the birth of her daughter in 2006, Shafak suffered from &lt;a href=\"postpartum%20depression\"&gt;postpartum depression&lt;/a&gt;, a period she addressed in her memoir \"Black Milk\".\nBibliography.\nNOTE: Marion Boyars Publishers Ltd was bought out by Viking in 2011."
