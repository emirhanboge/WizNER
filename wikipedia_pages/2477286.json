    "text": "H\u00e9rculez G\u00f3mez Hurtado (born April 6, 1982) is an American former professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; player who played as a &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;. He currently works as a commentator in both English and Spanish for &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nG\u00f3mez, the oldest of five children, was born in &lt;a href=\"Oxnard\"&gt;Oxnard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mexican-American\"&gt;Mexican-American&lt;/a&gt; parents. He grew up in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Las Vegas, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, and played on the soccer team at &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20High%20School\"&gt;Las Vegas High School&lt;/a&gt;.\nProfessional.\nClub career.\nEarly career.\nG\u00f3mez started his career in 2001 with &lt;a href=\"Cruz%20Azul\"&gt;Cruz Azul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20de%20M%C3%A9xico\"&gt;M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; on their second-division squad, and transferred to second-division team Aguilas Blancas de Puebla later that year. The following season, he returned to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n with &lt;a href=\"Alacranes%20de%20Durango\"&gt;Durango&lt;/a&gt;. However, playing opportunities were scarce for him there. The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Galaxy\"&gt;Los Angeles Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; staff noticed him during a friendly match and he joined the team in September.\nMLS.\nG\u00f3mez broke his foot while on loan to the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Sounders%20%281994%E2%80%932008%29\"&gt;Seattle Sounders&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Soccer%20Leagues\"&gt;United Soccer Leagues&lt;/a&gt;, and recovery took a long time. When he was able to play again, he joined the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Sockers%20%28WISL%29\"&gt;San Diego Sockers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Major%20Indoor%20Soccer%20League%20%282001%E2%80%9308%29\"&gt;Major Indoor Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to the Galaxy for the 2005 season on a developmental contract, but played well enough to make it to the first team. His big chance came when &lt;a href=\"Landon%20Donovan\"&gt;Landon Donovan&lt;/a&gt; was called up to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;national team&lt;/a&gt;. Donovan's absence gave G\u00f3mez many more starts at striker, and he was able to shine as a breakout goal-scorer.\nHe scored the game-winning goal in the 2005 &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup\"&gt;Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup&lt;/a&gt; Final, then helped the Galaxy to a rare Cup 'double' when they also won the 2005 &lt;a href=\"MLS%20Cup\"&gt;MLS Cup&lt;/a&gt;. G\u00f3mez ended the 2005 season with eighteen goals scored for the Galaxy (in all matches), and was voted by the local L.A. media as the year's Most Valuable Player.\nEarly in the 2006 season, Gomez was moved to the bench with then-coach &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Sampson\"&gt;Steve Sampson&lt;/a&gt;. Sampson used Gomez as a midfielder to see if he could score goals running at defenses. After Sampson's firing, however, Gomez scored several times under new coach &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Yallop\"&gt;Frank Yallop&lt;/a&gt;, and ended that season with five goals.\nIn December 2006, Gomez was traded to the Colorado Rapids along with &lt;a href=\"Ugo%20Ihemelu\"&gt;Ugo Ihemelu&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Cannon%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;Joe Cannon&lt;/a&gt;. He scored the first goal in the history of &lt;a href=\"Dick%27s%20Sporting%20Goods%20Park\"&gt;Dick's Sporting Goods Park&lt;/a&gt; in his first game for Colorado, a 2-1 win over &lt;a href=\"D.C.%20United\"&gt;D.C. United&lt;/a&gt; on April 7, 2007. G\u00f3mez tore his &lt;a href=\"anterior%20cruciate%20ligament\"&gt;ACL&lt;/a&gt; during training with the Rapids in September of that year and was forced to undergo a lengthy recovery process.\nG\u00f3mez was traded to &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Wizards\"&gt;Kansas City Wizards&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for allocation money, a fourth round &lt;a href=\"2009%20MLS%20SuperDraft\"&gt;2009 MLS SuperDraft&lt;/a&gt; pick and a first round 2009 MLS Supplemental Draft pick in September 2008. His only goal for the Wizards was an injury time winner against &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20Earthquakes\"&gt;San Jose Earthquakes&lt;/a&gt;, a must win game in their 2008 play-offs push.\nMexico.\nAfter being released by Kansas City in late 2009, G\u00f3mez experienced a career revival after signing with Mexican club &lt;a href=\"Puebla%20F.C.\"&gt;Puebla F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in January 2010. He scored ten goals in the 2010 Mexican season to tie for the lead for most goals; this feat marked the first time any American player led a foreign league in goals. He moved to &lt;a href=\"C.F.%20Pachuca\"&gt;Pachuca&lt;/a&gt; in the summer 2010 window.\nPachuca placed G\u00f3mez, along with its entire squad, on the transfer list. During the transfer window he moved along with teammate &lt;a href=\"Braulio%20Luna\"&gt;Braulio Luna&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Estudiantes%20Tecos\"&gt;Estudiantes Tecos&lt;/a&gt;. G\u00f3mez scored his first goal for his new club in the second game of the Mexico Apertura season, coming in a 2-1 loss to San Luis. On August 19, G\u00f3mez scored the winner as a sub against his former club Pachuca.\nCash-strapped Estudiantes Tecos were forced into selling G\u00f3mez to league rivals &lt;a href=\"Santos%20Laguna\"&gt;Santos Laguna&lt;/a&gt; in December 2011. G\u00f3mez scored 11 goals in his first 12 appearances for the team across all competitions.\nWith Santos Laguna's &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20de%20M%C3%A9xico%20season%23Torneo%20Clausura\"&gt;2012 Clausura&lt;/a&gt; victory, Gomez became the first player to have won both the MLS Cup and the Primera Divisi\u00f3n championship. In 2013, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Xolos%20de%20Tijuana\"&gt;Xolos de Tijuana&lt;/a&gt;. After struggling with Tijuana, he was loaned to &lt;a href=\"Tigres%20UANL\"&gt;Tigres UANL&lt;/a&gt; for the 2014\u201315 season. However, he ended the season poorly with only one goal. His loan was not extended.\nReturn to MLS.\nIn August 2015, Gomez joined &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20FC\"&gt;Toronto FC&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter his release from Toronto at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"2016%20MLS%20season\"&gt;2016 MLS season&lt;/a&gt;, Gomez joined &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Sounders%20FC\"&gt;Seattle Sounders FC&lt;/a&gt;. He won MLS Cup for the second time in his career. He retired following the season and joined &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; as an analyst.\nInternational.\nGomez was named to the United States roster for the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Copa%20America\"&gt;2007 Copa America&lt;/a&gt; and earned his first cap as a second-half substitute against &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, with his first start coming against &lt;a href=\"Colombia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a lengthy absence from the national team, Gomez was named to the provisional 30-man U.S. squad for the &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; after a highly productive club season in Mexico. He scored a goal for the U.S. national team in a 4\u20132 friendly defeat to the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; on May 25; the next day he was named to the final 23-man squad. Gomez played in 3 out of the 4 games for the United States at the World Cup, including the &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Bracket\"&gt;round of 16&lt;/a&gt; game against &lt;a href=\"Ghana%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;.\nGomez made his return to the national team in 2012, appearing in friendlies against &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and scoring a goal against the latter. Later in 2012, he scored goals in World Cup qualifying against &lt;a href=\"Antigua%20and%20Barbuda%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Antigua and Barbuda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jamaica%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;\nHis last national team appearance came during the &lt;a href=\"2013%20CONCACAF%20Gold%20Cup\"&gt;2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nBroadcaster.\nIn January 2017, Gomez announced his retirement from professional soccer, and joined the broadcasting team at &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;.
