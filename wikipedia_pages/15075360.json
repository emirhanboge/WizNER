    "text": "A roll-out shelf, also known as a glide-out shelf, pull-out shelf or slide-out shelf is a &lt;a href=\"shelf%20%28storage%29\"&gt;shelf&lt;/a&gt; that can be moved forward on slides in order to more easily reach the contents stored in the back of a &lt;a href=\"cupboard\"&gt;cupboard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cabinet%20%28furniture%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt;. The slide mechanism can also be found in modern chests of drawers. Cabinet makers have been installing roll-out shelves for over 50 years.\nApplications.\nRoll-out shelves are found in kitchen cabinets, pantries, bathroom cabinets and vanities, offices, and garages. They are available with 3/4 extension or full extension slides. The 3/4 extension slides provide enough access to reach items in the back of the cabinet. Full extension rails are more costly but can provide better access for special use areas."
