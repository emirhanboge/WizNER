    "text": "St. Patrick High School is an all-boys college preparatory &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; high school located in the &lt;a href=\"Belmont-Cragin\"&gt;Belmont-Cragin&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood on the northwest side of &lt;a href=\"Chicago%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. Opened in 1861, it is among the oldest continuously open high schools in the Chicago area.\nHistory.\nThe original school, St. Patrick Academy, was opened by the &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20the%20Brothers%20of%20the%20Christian%20Schools\"&gt;Christian Brothers&lt;/a&gt; near Adams Street and Des Plaines. In 1953, the school moved to its current site, on Belmont and Austin avenues. The student population was bigger than anticipated, which required almost immediate addition to the new structure; a construction project completed for the 1956\u201457 school year.\nIn 1991, one floor of the school was redeveloped as a computer center. After a long term fundraising effort, further addition and remodeling took place with the addition of an atrium, theater, music facilities, media center, and a second smaller gymnasium.\nAcademics.\nSt. Patrick offers three levels of education to its students: the Phoenix Program for students who need additional academic support, the College Prep Program, and the Honors Program.\nStudent life.\nNon-Athletic Activities.\nThe school also has an &lt;a href=\"quizbowl\"&gt;academic team&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; team, band, &lt;a href=\"FIRST%20Robotics%20Competition\"&gt;FIRST Robotics Competition&lt;/a&gt;, and dance. The chess team finished second in the IHSA state chess tournament in 1977 and tied for third in 2008. The chess team has had multiple state tournament appearances, and has developed a friendly rivalry with &lt;a href=\"St.%20Ignatius%20College%20Prep\"&gt;St. Ignatius College Prep&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"cheerleading\"&gt;cheerleading&lt;/a&gt; squad is composed of girls from nearby all-girls schools who choose to try out.\nTheatre Department.\nThe school's Theatre Department stages one play in the fall, one student play in the winter, one musical in the spring, and one miscellaneous play in the summer as part of its Community Theater Initiative. The school\u2019s theatre, the Stahl Family Theatre, is partnered with the Chicago Kids Theatre Company for it being one of the most technologically advanced theaters in the Chicago area.\nAthletics.\nSt. Patrick's athletic teams are named the Shamrocks. The school participates in the &lt;a href=\"East%20Suburban%20Catholic%20Conference\"&gt;East Suburban Catholic Conference&lt;/a&gt; (ESCC) for most of their sports, which include &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, bowling, &lt;a href=\"Cross%20country%20running\"&gt;cross country&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"high%20school%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soccer\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt;, swimming &amp; diving, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"track%20%26amp%3B%20field\"&gt;track &amp; field&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"volleyball\"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt;, water polo, and &lt;a href=\"wrestling\"&gt;wrestling&lt;/a&gt;. The school also sponsors teams in &lt;a href=\"bowling\"&gt;bowling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swimming%20%28sport%29\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Diving%20%28sport%29\"&gt;diving&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"water%20polo\"&gt;water polo&lt;/a&gt; which are not sponsored by the ESCC. All of these sports have state tournaments sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Illinois%20High%20School%20Association\"&gt;Illinois High School Association&lt;/a&gt; (IHSA).\nThe following teams have placed in the top four of their respective IHSA sponsored state championship tournaments:\nBasketball.\nIn 1932 St. Patrick (at the time called St. Patrick Academy) won the National Catholic Interscholastic Basketball Tournament. The tournament was hosted by &lt;a href=\"Loyola%20University%20Chicago\"&gt;Loyola University&lt;/a&gt;, and it invited high schools from across the country, including top teams in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, all of which were considered powerhouse states for basketball at the high school level. St. Patrick was originally not invited to play in the tournament, but was called in last minute as a substitute when an originally schedule team could not make the tournament.\nThe national champion Shamrocks defeated the now closed St. Mel (Chicago) Knights 22-20. A young &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Meyer\"&gt;Ray Meyer&lt;/a&gt;, famous DePaul University men\u2019s basketball coach, lead the Shamrocks with 12 points.\nIn 1949 St. Patrick captured the Chicago City Championship crown, which had the Chicago Public League champion against the Chicago Catholic League champion.\nSt. Patrick defeated &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Catholic%20High%20School\"&gt;Leo High School&lt;/a&gt; 47-35 securing them their first Chicago Catholic League title. St. Patrick had to play &lt;a href=\"Tilden%20High%20School%20%28Chicago%29\"&gt;Tilden High School&lt;/a&gt;, the Chicago Public League champion, for the City Championship. At &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Stadium\"&gt;Chicago Stadium&lt;/a&gt; the Shamrocks upset Tilden 54-53. The Shamrocks trailed throughout the majority of the game, but were able to take the lead in the final minute, and completed the historic upset.\nWater Polo.\nThe 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s treated the Shamrocks well in terms of water polo. The team won multiple competitions, with dominate winning seasons. The Shamrocks had multiple state finals appearances, and one state title. The water polo team won the ISA (Illinois Swimming Association) state title in 1997, going 28\u20130. This was not an IHSA sponsored title, as water polo only became an IHSA sponsored sport in 2001."
