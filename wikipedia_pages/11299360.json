    "text": "Hans Verlan Andersen (November 6, 1914 \u2013 July 16, 1992) was a &lt;a href=\"general%20authority\"&gt;general authority&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints\"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt; (LDS Church) and a professor at &lt;a href=\"Brigham%20Young%20University\"&gt;Brigham Young University&lt;/a&gt; (BYU).\nAndersen was called to the LDS Church's &lt;a href=\"First%20Quorum%20of%20the%20Seventy\"&gt;First Quorum of the Seventy&lt;/a&gt; in April 1986. On April 1, 1989 he was transferred to the newly created &lt;a href=\"Second%20Quorum%20of%20the%20Seventy\"&gt;Second Quorum of the Seventy&lt;/a&gt;. On October 5, 1991, he was released from his service as a general authority. He died of &lt;a href=\"cancer\"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; on July 16, 1992.\nEarly life and education.\nAndersen was born on 6 Nov 1914 in &lt;a href=\"Logan%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Logan, Utah&lt;/a&gt; to Hans Andersen and Mynoa Richardson, and spent his earliest years on a dry farm in &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Creek%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Blue Creek, Utah&lt;/a&gt;. He was baptized by his father on May 6, 1923, and the next year his family moved to &lt;a href=\"Virden%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Virden, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to be closer to his Andersen and Richardson grandparents in the &lt;a href=\"Gila%20Valley%20%28Graham%20County%29\"&gt;Gila Valley&lt;/a&gt;. His paternal grandfather, Andrew Andersen, was from &lt;a href=\"Otterup\"&gt;Otterup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; and his paternal grandmother, Janet Henderson, was from &lt;a href=\"Haddington%2C%20East%20Lothian\"&gt;Haddington, Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. His paternal grandparents both emigrated to America after joining the LDS Church. After stints in Utah and Mexico, Andrew and Janet settled in Virden, where Andersen's parents, Hans and Mynoa, moved the family in 1923-24. Andersen grew up working on the family farm.\nAfter finishing high school, in September 1933, Andersen received a call to serve a &lt;a href=\"Mormon%20missionary\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; in the church's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//history.churchofjesuschrist.org/missionary/mission/north-central-states%3Flang%3Deng\"&gt;North Central States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mission%20%28LDS%20Church%29\"&gt;Mission&lt;/a&gt;, which included Minnesota, along with North and South Dakota. After returning home in October 1935, he enrolled at Gila Junior College (previously the St. Joseph Stake Academy, now &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Arizona%20College\"&gt;Eastern Arizona College&lt;/a&gt;) where he was president of the &lt;a href=\"sophomore\"&gt;sophomore&lt;/a&gt; class. He graduated in 1937.\nAndersen was ordained a seventy by &lt;a href=\"Melvin%20J.%20Ballard\"&gt;Melvin J. Ballard&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Quorum%20of%20the%20Twelve%20Apostles%20%28LDS%20Church%29\"&gt;Quorum of the Twelve Apostles&lt;/a&gt; in 1936. He enrolled at BYU in the fall of 1938 and graduated in June 1940 with a &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt; in accounting, one month after his father died from cancer. After his father's death, he helped his mother and younger siblings move from New Mexico to &lt;a href=\"Mesa%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Mesa, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. After one load of furniture and family genealogy had been taken to Mesa, the family's home, belongings, and farm were destroyed in the Gila River flood of September 1941. After working for the Harmon Audit Company in Phoenix and Prescott from 1940 to 1942, he moved back to Mesa in the summer of 1942, where he took a job with a local &lt;a href=\"Certified%20Public%20Accountant\"&gt;CPA&lt;/a&gt;. In January 1943, he met Shirley Hoyt at a &lt;a href=\"stake%20conference\"&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; of the church's &lt;a href=\"Maricopa%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Maricopa&lt;/a&gt; Arizona &lt;a href=\"Stake%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29\"&gt;Stake&lt;/a&gt;. They were married in the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20Temple\"&gt;Salt Lake Temple&lt;/a&gt; on June 15, 1943 by &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20E.%20McKay\"&gt;Thomas E. McKay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Andersens continued to live in Arizona until they moved to &lt;a href=\"Palo%20Alto%2C%20California\"&gt;Palo Alto, California&lt;/a&gt; in the fall of 1944 where Andersen attended &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20Law%20School\"&gt;law school&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20University\"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;. He received the Henry Newell Scholarship, and graduated in 1946 with an &lt;a href=\"LL.B.\"&gt;LL.B.&lt;/a&gt; degree and &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Coif\"&gt;Order of the Coif&lt;/a&gt; honors. Starting January 1, 1946, he worked for Wayne Mayhew and Co. in &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; until he was recruited to teach law and accounting at BYU in the fall of 1946. He left teaching at BYU after one year to attend &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Law%20School\"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt;, where he earned an &lt;a href=\"LL.M.\"&gt;LL.M.&lt;/a&gt; degree in 1948.\nProfessional Career.\nAfter law school, Andersen set up a law and accounting practice in Phoenix and worked there until accepting another invitation to teach law and business at BYU starting in the fall of 1953. Except for a brief stint in Phoenix from 1962 to 1965, Andersen was a professor of accounting at BYU until 1981 during the administrations of &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20L.%20Wilkinson\"&gt;Ernest L. Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dallin%20H.%20Oaks\"&gt;Dallin H. Oaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Brigham%20Young%20High%20School\"&gt;Brigham Young High School&lt;/a&gt; closed in 1968, Andersen met with a group of other BYU professors and parents with the intent of establishing a private school. They desired to have their children's academic learning enhanced and enlightened by principles of morality, religion, liberty and patriotism. The founders purchased an LDS meetinghouse in &lt;a href=\"Pleasant%20Grove%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Pleasant Grove, Utah&lt;/a&gt;, and opened the &lt;a href=\"American%20Heritage%20School%20%28Utah%29\"&gt;American Heritage School&lt;/a&gt; in 1970 with 80 students enrolled. Today, AHS has roughly one thousand students and was honored to have President &lt;a href=\"Dallin%20H.%20Oaks\"&gt;Dallin H. Oaks&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints\"&gt;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt;, deliver its 2011 and 2021 commencement addresses.\nFrom 1969 to 1973, Andersen served in the &lt;a href=\"Utah%20State%20Legislature\"&gt;Utah State Legislature&lt;/a&gt;.\nChurch Service.\nIn the early 1980s, the Andersens were called as church service missionaries, first in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;Buenos Aires, Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and then in &lt;a href=\"Lima%2C%20Peru\"&gt;Lima, Peru&lt;/a&gt;. In April 1986, Andersen was called to be a general authority as a member of the church's First Quorum of the Seventy. From 1986 to 1989, Andersen served as a member of the presidency of the church's Mexico and Central America &lt;a href=\"Area%20%28LDS%20Church%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;. In 1989, the Andersens returned to Argentina when he was assigned to the South America South Area. In 1990, he became a counselor in the general presidency of the church's &lt;a href=\"Sunday%20School%20%28LDS%20Church%29\"&gt;Sunday School&lt;/a&gt;, while also serving in the presidency of the Utah Central Area. Upon returning to Utah, he was diagnosed with cancer. In the church's October 1991 general conference, Andersen was released as a general authority and gave his final conference address. He died of cancer in on July 16, 1992.\nPolitical Views.\nAndersen was a supporter of the original intent of the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Constitution\"&gt;U.S. Constitution&lt;/a&gt; and was critical of unconstitutional government. As he explained in his first book:\nAs originally interpreted, the United States Constitution denied government the right to regulate and control the citizen in the use of his property. Over the years the commerce clause and the general welfare clause have been so interpreted as to permit both the state and Federal governments to regiment labor, agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, communication, finance and all other forms of economic activity. Today, if there is any limit on the power of government to regulate, no one knows what that limit is. (\"Many Are Called But Few Are Chosen\", p.45)\nAnecdote.\nAndersen is probably most well-known to &lt;a href=\"Latter-day%20Saints\"&gt;Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt; by the following story, told by &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20S.%20Monson\"&gt;Thomas S. Monson&lt;/a&gt;, that speaks of Andersen's strict devotion to keeping the commandments."
