    "text": "Aaron the Tyrant () or Aron Vod\u0103 (\"Aron the &lt;a href=\"Voivode\"&gt;Voivode&lt;/a&gt;\"; &lt;a href=\"Old%20Church%20Slavonic%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Church Slavonic&lt;/a&gt;: Ap\u0461\u043d \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430), sometimes credited as Aron Emanoil or Emanuel Aaron (, , or \"Zalim\"; before 1560 \u2013 May 1597), was twice the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Moldavia\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt;: between September 1591 and June 1592, and October 1592 to May 3 or 4, 1595. He was of mysterious origin, and possibly of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; extraction, but presented himself as the son of &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20L%C4%83pu%C8%99neanu\"&gt;Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu&lt;/a&gt;, and was recognized as such in some circles. His appointment by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; followed an informal race, during which candidates engaging in particularly exorbitant bribery and accepted unprecedented increases of the \"&lt;a href=\"hara%C3%A7\"&gt;hara\u00e7&lt;/a&gt;\". Though resented by the &lt;a href=\"Janissaries\"&gt;Janissaries&lt;/a&gt;, he was backed by a powerful lobby, comprising &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Ashkenazi\"&gt;Solomon Ashkenazi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Barton%20%28diplomat%29\"&gt;Edward Barton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hoca%20Sadeddin%20Efendi\"&gt;Hoca Sadeddin Efendi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;Patriarch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jeremias%20II%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;Jeremias II&lt;/a&gt;. Victorious but heavily indebted, Aaron allowed his creditors to interfere directly in fiscal policy, while adopting methods of extortion against the taxpaying peasantry. He eventually turned against the bankers, staging the execution of &lt;a href=\"Bartolomeo%20Bruti\"&gt;Bartolomeo Brutti&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing such moves, and his heavy-handed repression of rebels in &lt;a href=\"L%C4%83pu%C8%99na%20County%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;L\u0103pu\u0219na&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orhei%20County%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Orhei&lt;/a&gt;, Aaron was ordered to step down by the &lt;a href=\"Sublime%20Porte\"&gt;Porte&lt;/a&gt;. The order was rescinded after two months, which had seen the ascendancy of a rebel Prince, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Cossack\"&gt;Peter the Cossack&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron took back his throne, being increasingly reliant on support from the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Transylvania%20%281570%E2%80%931711%29\"&gt;Principality of Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;. He entered his second reign as an obedient vassal of the Ottomans, while also turning against &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Moldavian Catholicism&lt;/a&gt; and expelling the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Society of Jesus&lt;/a&gt;. In secret, he began negotiating Moldavia's participation in the anti-Ottoman \"&lt;a href=\"Holy%20League%20%281594%29\"&gt;Holy League&lt;/a&gt;\", defining himself as an ally of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Holy See&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. This project drew support from Transylvania, which was then under &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%20B%C3%A1thory\"&gt;Sigismund B\u00e1thory&lt;/a&gt;, as well as from &lt;a href=\"Wallachia\"&gt;Wallachia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Michael%20the%20Brave\"&gt;Michael the Brave&lt;/a&gt;. With the start of the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Turkish%20War\"&gt;Long Turkish War&lt;/a&gt; in 1593, Moldavia became a secondary theater, invaded successively by the &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20Khanate\"&gt;Crimean Khanate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zaporizhian%20Sich\"&gt;Zaporizhian Sich&lt;/a&gt;; after long negotiations, Aaron was able to ally himself with the latter. He then helped Michael of Wallachia attack the Ottoman flank, extending his rule into the &lt;a href=\"Budjak\"&gt;Budjak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Dobruja\"&gt;Northern Dobruja&lt;/a&gt;. During the events, he ordered a series of massacres, killing &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Army\"&gt;Ottoman Army&lt;/a&gt; prisoners and 19 Jewish financiers.\nDespite his military commitment and his quashing of a pro-Ottoman uprising, Aaron was viewed with suspicion by B\u00e1thory. Their relationship became tense after Aaron declined to swear &lt;a href=\"fealty\"&gt;fealty&lt;/a&gt; at the Transylvanian court, preferring instead for Moldavia to be ruled as a component of the Holy Roman Empire. B\u00e1thory reportedly undermined the League, depicting Aaron as untrustworthy; he also endorsed the Moldavian general &lt;a href=\"%C8%98tefan%20R%C4%83zvan\"&gt;\u0218tefan R\u0103zvan&lt;/a&gt;, who arrested the Prince and took over his throne. Aaron and his family were exiled to &lt;a href=\"Bra%C8%99ov\"&gt;Corona (Bra\u0219ov)&lt;/a&gt;, then detained at &lt;a href=\"Martinuzzi%20Castle\"&gt;Martinuzzi Castle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vin%C8%9Bu%20de%20Jos\"&gt;Alvinc (Vin\u021bu de Jos)&lt;/a&gt;\u2014where Aaron died, allegedly poisoned. He was survived by his stepson &lt;a href=\"Marcu%20Cercel\"&gt;Marcu Cercel&lt;/a&gt;, who attached himself to the Wallachian court and briefly served as Michael's subordinate Prince of Moldavia. Aaron's name is preserved by &lt;a href=\"Aroneanu%20Church\"&gt;Aroneanu Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aroneanu\"&gt;eponymous village&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are located outside &lt;a href=\"Ia%C8%99i\"&gt;Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt;. He is also celebrated as a sponsor of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Romanian%20School\"&gt;First Romanian School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"%C8%98cheii%20Bra%C8%99ovului\"&gt;\u0218cheii Bra\u0219ovului&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nDebated origins.\nAaron's origins and early life are a matter of scholarly dispute. His second or non-regnal name, rendered as \"Emanuel\" or \"Emanoil\", has been deduced from a German-language document dealing with his bid for the Moldavian throne; historian &lt;a href=\"A.%20D.%20Xenopol\"&gt;A. D. Xenopol&lt;/a&gt; proposed using it consistently, to distinguish between Aaron and his 15th-century predecessor, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Aaron\"&gt;Peter Aaron&lt;/a&gt;. He depicted himself as a son of &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20L%C4%83pu%C8%99neanu\"&gt;Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu&lt;/a&gt;, who had twice ruled upon Moldavia in the 1550s and '60s. He was also recognized as such by the &lt;a href=\"Lviv%20Dormition%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Lviv Dormition Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, who asked him to resume the patronage of his \"saintly deceased father\". In 1594, a \"&lt;a href=\"Slavic%20honorifics\"&gt;Pan&lt;/a&gt;\" Dro\u017cy\u0144ski of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; noted that Moldavians recognized kinship between Aaron and the L\u0103pu\u0219neanus: Aaron and Alexandru's daughter M\u0103rica Orzechowska viewed each other as brother and sister, and Orzechowska even joined his court to serve as a translator of Polish. Orzechowska also raised her orphaned niece, Anna Czo\u0142ha\u0144ska, who, according to genealogist \u0218tefan S. Gorovei, was Aaron's own niece.\nModern scholars who accept Aaron's genealogical claims include &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Lapedatu\"&gt;Alexandru Lapedatu&lt;/a&gt;, who thus argues that Aaron was the final male representative of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Bogdan-Mu%C8%99at\"&gt;Bogdan-Mu\u0219at dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. In some of his work, historian &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Iorga\"&gt;Nicolae Iorga&lt;/a&gt; also credits the genealogy. He once described Aaron as an \"unrecognized child\" of the Prince, whom he nevertheless resembled, being \"mean and gluttonous\". Elsewhere, he credited reports that Aaron was a direct descendant of &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20III%20of%20Moldavia\"&gt;Stephen the Great&lt;/a&gt;. Cultural historian &lt;a href=\"R%C4%83zvan%20Theodorescu\"&gt;R\u0103zvan Theodorescu&lt;/a&gt; also endorses the claim.\nThe Moldavian classical historian &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Neculce\"&gt;Ioan Neculce&lt;/a&gt; renders a conflicting account. This depicts young Aaron as the nephew and servant of &lt;a href=\"Metropolis%20of%20Moldavia%20and%20Bukovina\"&gt;Moldavian Metropolitan&lt;/a&gt; Nicanor, with whom he lived at &lt;a href=\"Agapia%20Monastery\"&gt;Agapia Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. While there, Aaron seduced a nun, and was caught by Nicanor while returning from her chambers. The bishop punished him with a public beating, then chased him out of the country. A variant of the story was recorded in 1886 by jurist Iancu Cerkez, who refers to Aaron's uncle as \"&lt;a href=\"Starets\"&gt;Starets&lt;/a&gt;\" Silvan, and notes that the beating occurred when Aaron failed to respect a &lt;a href=\"curfew\"&gt;curfew&lt;/a&gt;. According to Cerkez, the boy was not expelled, but rather \"fled out of shame and returned only when he could return as a Prince\".\nWriting before Neculce, the physician Penzen recounted that Aaron was \"of the Jewish race\". According to researcher &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Gane\"&gt;Constantin Gane&lt;/a&gt;, Aaron was a \"Jewish Prince\", born as \"Solomon Tedeschi [...] to one of our voivodes and a Jewish woman.\" The identification of Aaron and Tedeschi is nonetheless contradicted by period sources: &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Ashkenazi\"&gt;Solomon Ashkenazi&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"Tedeschi\", was in fact an influential &lt;a href=\"court%20Jew\"&gt;court Jew&lt;/a&gt; of the Ottoman Empire, who backed Aaron in his quest for the throne. Xenopol also argues against the possibility that Aaron was born to a Prince and his Jewish mistress, and proposes that he may have been &lt;a href=\"Who%20is%20a%20Jew%3F\"&gt;fully Jewish&lt;/a&gt;. He notes that any royal descent would clash with details provided by the chronicler &lt;a href=\"Reinhold%20Heidenstein\"&gt;Reinhold Heidenstein&lt;/a&gt;; Heidenstein depicts Aaron as a former stablehand for the &lt;a href=\"Boyars%20of%20Wallachia%20and%20Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavian boyardom&lt;/a&gt;, and as \"having usurped, under whatever circumstances, the title of boyar.\"\nJewish studies academic Elli Kohen also noted the story regarding Aaron's beginnings in horse grooming, but describes him as a \"Pole of hypothetical Jewish extraction\". Another researcher, &lt;a href=\"Iosif%20Sterca-%C8%98ulu%C8%9Biu\"&gt;Iosif Sterca-\u0218ulu\u021biu&lt;/a&gt;, rejects both Penzen and Heidenstein's accounts, noting that, if they had been true, they would also have been taken up in political literature. His version, based on theories circulated by the &lt;a href=\"Transylvanian%20School\"&gt;Transylvanian School&lt;/a&gt;, is that Aaron was the son of a Romanian expatriate from &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281526%E2%80%931867%29\"&gt;Royal Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, Aron of Pozsony, who in the 1540s had wanted to seize the Moldavian throne as a &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg&lt;/a&gt; candidate; though existentially opposed to L\u0103pu\u0219neanu, this Aron may have been L\u0103pu\u0219neanu's brother\u2014and son of &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20III%20the%20One-Eyed\"&gt;Bogdan III&lt;/a&gt;. Sterca-\u0218ulu\u021biu reads Aaron's references to \"my father\" L\u0103pu\u0219neanu as clues that the reigning Prince had adopted him in the 1560s.\nSome uncertainty also covers Aaron's matrimonial alliances. One interpretation of period texts suggests that he was the son-in-law of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Greeks\"&gt;Ottoman Greek&lt;/a&gt; businessman and kingmaker, &lt;a href=\"Andronikos%20Kantakouzenos%20%281553%E2%80%931601%29\"&gt;Andronikos Kantakouzenos&lt;/a&gt;; also according to this reading, Kantakouzenos' other daughter was married to Wallachia's &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20the%20Deaf\"&gt;Stephen the Deaf&lt;/a&gt;. This take was rejected by historian Matei Cazacu, who notes that it is based on a mistranslation by Iorga. Several contemporary accounts mention that Aaron was in fact married to a former wife or concubine of Wallachia's Prince &lt;a href=\"Petru%20Cercel\"&gt;Petru Cercel&lt;/a&gt;, whose name was probably Stanca. She was most likely the mother of &lt;a href=\"Marcu%20Cercel\"&gt;Marcu Cercel&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly also of his brothers Iona\u0219cu and Radu Petru. Stanca may have been an &lt;a href=\"Turks%20in%20Romania\"&gt;ethnic Turk&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Apostasy%20in%20Islam\"&gt;Muslim apostate&lt;/a&gt; whose original name was Sultana, and was perhaps also a renegade member of the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6pr%C3%BCl%C3%BC%20family\"&gt;K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family&lt;/a&gt;.\nScandalous rise.\nAaron's career overlapped with a &lt;a href=\"Transformation%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;generalized political and economic crisis&lt;/a&gt;, observed in both Moldavia and &lt;a href=\"Wallachia\"&gt;Wallachia&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Danubian%20Principalities\"&gt;Danubian Principalities&lt;/a&gt;), as well as throughout their &lt;a href=\"Vassal%20and%20tributary%20states%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;suzerain power&lt;/a&gt;, the Ottoman Empire. During the late stages of &lt;a href=\"Romania%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Romanian medieval history&lt;/a&gt;, there was a \"continuous degradation of the princely office\", bringing Moldavia to the \"wretched state which had already taken hold in Wallachia\". Art historian Corina Nicolescu also describes a \"relative stagnation\" of cultural development in both states, correlated with the \"ever-increasing subjugation\" and the \"backward characteristics of Turkish society\". This decline corresponded with the Ottoman drive for funds: in 1589, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Ottoman%20Grand%20Viziers\"&gt;Grand Vizier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Koca%20Sinan%20Pasha\"&gt;Koca Sinan Pasha&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that his fiscal regime could only supply one third of the imperial expenses. In 1591, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Lame\"&gt;Peter the Lame&lt;/a&gt;, \"unable to meet the incessant demands for money that came from &lt;a href=\"Stamboul\"&gt;Stamboul&lt;/a&gt;\", relinquished his Moldavian throne, \"rather than to await his own ousting, exile, or killing.\"\nAs historian Mihai Maxim notes, Peter was unable to pay his main tribute, or \"&lt;a href=\"hara%C3%A7\"&gt;hara\u00e7&lt;/a&gt;\", after the Ottomans' &lt;a href=\"stabilization%20policy\"&gt;stabilization policy&lt;/a&gt;, which included &lt;a href=\"Fixed%20exchange-rate%20system\"&gt;pegging the exchange rate&lt;/a&gt;. The Prince also lost the crucial backing of Sinan Pasha, who had been deposed. According to the 17th-century chronicler &lt;a href=\"Grigore%20Ureche\"&gt;Grigore Ureche&lt;/a&gt;, Peter was ultimately pushed to resign and flee by his patriotism, dismissing the alternative of increasing revenue through taxation: \"he did not want the curse of his country to be on him.\" Xenopol dismisses this reading as \"apologetic\" and charitable, noting that Peter was well acquainted with the Ottoman practices, and would still have bribed his way to the throne under normal circumstances.\nAaron was reportedly familiar to &lt;a href=\"Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;Orthodox Patriarch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jeremias%20II%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;Jeremias II&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced him &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Barton%20%28diplomat%29\"&gt;Edward Barton&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20diplomats%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;English Ambassador&lt;/a&gt;. Both Jeremias and Barton wanted a Prince who would overturn the rise of &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Catholicism in Moldavia&lt;/a&gt;, which Peter the Lame had tolerated or favored; an Orthodox monk, Nikephoros Didaskalos, and a French adventurer, Fran\u00e7ois Ponthus de la Planche, remained in contact with Barton, helping to streamline the project. Aaron's ascent also required joint efforts by Ashkenazi and Barton (who were good friends at the time), and backing from various princesses of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Imperial%20Harem\"&gt;Sultan's Harem&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron presented the latter with lavish gifts, including a diamond ring and an emerald necklace. He won additional endorsements from &lt;a href=\"Hoca%20Sadeddin%20Efendi\"&gt;Hoca Sadeddin Efendi&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"%C5%9Eeyh%C3%BClisl%C4%81m\"&gt;\u015eeyh\u00fclisl\u0101m&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Bostanzade%20Mehmet%20Efendi\"&gt;Bostanzade&lt;/a&gt;. He defeated powerful contenders, including \u0218tefan, who was the son of &lt;a href=\"Ilie%20II%20Rare%C8%99\"&gt;Ilie II Rare\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, and L\u0103pu\u0219neanu's known son, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Cossack\"&gt;Peter the Cossack&lt;/a&gt;. Another candidate was &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20cel%20R%C4%83u\"&gt;Alexandru III L\u0103pu\u0219neanu&lt;/a&gt;, Aaron's alleged nephew, who had backing from the &lt;a href=\"Janissaries\"&gt;Janissaries&lt;/a&gt;. In one incident of the interregnum, Alexandru's supporters raided Patriarchy buildings; they demanded that Aaron be sent to live as a prisoner in &lt;a href=\"Aleppo\"&gt;Aleppo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to ensure his victory, Aaron is alleged to have paid officials at the Ottoman court 110 million \"&lt;a href=\"ak%C3%A7e\"&gt;ak\u00e7e&lt;/a&gt;ler\". This \"fantastic sum\", equivalent to some 917,000 &lt;a href=\"ducat\"&gt;ducat&lt;/a&gt;s, was borrowed from traders and creditors at 20% interest. Some of the scripts were owned by Barton and the &lt;a href=\"Levant%20Company\"&gt;Levant Company&lt;/a&gt;, marking an early step in the evolution of &lt;a href=\"Romania%E2%80%93United%20Kingdom%20relations\"&gt;Anglo\u2013Moldavian diplomatic contacts&lt;/a&gt;. Kohen sees the alliance between Ashkenazi and Barton as motivated by two sets of interests: the former wanted a \"more humane treatment for Jews in the semi-autonomous principality\", while Barton responded to &lt;a href=\"Elizabethan%20era\"&gt;Elizabethan&lt;/a&gt; priorities, aiming to increase influence in Eastern Europe.\nThis selection process by the Ottomans marked a low in Moldavian history, described by Iorga as a \"bargain\". It also provided the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Murad%20III\"&gt;Murad III&lt;/a&gt; with new sources of income: as recounted by &lt;a href=\"Mustafa%20Selaniki\"&gt;Mustafa Selaniki&lt;/a&gt; (and supported by Maxim), Aaron had promised to collect an even higher \"hara\u00e7\" than his predecessors. The tribute for Aaron's first year was set at about 60,000 &lt;a href=\"Sequin%20%28coin%29\"&gt;sequins&lt;/a&gt;, possibly ten times its regular value, and the absolute highest sum to be paid by Moldavia. As noted by Maxim, when coupled with the princely credits and with the demographic decline affecting taxable income, this pledge created an \"impossible situation\". Xenopol describes taxation as handled directly by the Prince's creditors, a \"continuous stream of Turks\". They resorted to torturing peasants in their attempt to recover lost revenue, and also invented an \"unprecedented tax\", collecting one ox from each family of taxpayers. Sterca-\u0218ulu\u021biu, however, questions whether the measure was truly unique or completely devastating.\nAs noted in Grigore Ureche's hostile account, Aaron's policies made the peasants into quasi-serfs. Ureche attributes this development to flaws of character, claiming that Aaron \"never grew tired of fornicating and gambling\". Neculce also claims that Aaron acted out of personal revenge, as when he allegedly captured his \"uncle\" Nicanor and castrated him. More in detail, Ureche accuses Aaron of raping boyaresses and women from the peasantry. Sterca-\u0218ulu\u021biu challenges this account, noting that Ureche fails to record a concrete case, or name the alleged victims.\nFirst rule.\nSeveral other controversial developments occurred under Aaron. Some had to do with the rising influence of &lt;a href=\"Greeks%20in%20Romania\"&gt;immigrant Greeks&lt;/a&gt;. Medievalist Ioan Capro\u0219u argues that Aaron's reign inaugurated the monopolizing of \"&lt;a href=\"Vistier\"&gt;Vistier&lt;/a&gt;\" (treasurer) offices by \"intermediaries of the Oriental trade\". At any one time, three of his eleven high courtiers were Greek; Aaron inherited from his predecessor Peter the \"Vistier\" Iani Kalogeras, who enjoyed the third-longest time in office of any Moldavian treasurer between 1600 and 1700. His \"&lt;a href=\"Postelnic\"&gt;Postelnic&lt;/a&gt;\" was a Iane, possibly the same identified as an \"&lt;a href=\"Epirus\"&gt;Epirote&lt;/a&gt;\" in earlier documents, while the first of his \"&lt;a href=\"Spatharios\"&gt;Spatharii&lt;/a&gt;\" was Constantin Vorsi; in 1594, his \"&lt;a href=\"Paharnic\"&gt;Paharnic&lt;/a&gt;\" was an &lt;a href=\"Albanians%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Coci\"&gt;Nicolae Coci&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in 1593, Andronikos became Moldavia's \"&lt;a href=\"Ban%20%28title%29\"&gt;Ban&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1591, the &lt;a href=\"Sfatul%20boieresc\"&gt;Boyar Council&lt;/a&gt; also included another \"Vistier\", known as Planica or Plani\u021ba. According to medievalist \u0218tefan Andreescu, this was a &lt;a href=\"Old%20Church%20Slavonic%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Slavonic&lt;/a&gt; name for Ponthus de la Planche. The non-native retinue was enhanced by a permanent guard of &lt;a href=\"Hungarians%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries, who proved crucial in protecting Aaron during subsequent revolts. Both Iorga and &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20I.%20Br%C4%83tianu\"&gt;Gheorghe I. Br\u0103tianu&lt;/a&gt; argue that they were inherited from Peter the Lame, and as such comprised up to 400 men \"dressed in Hungarian clothing, with swords on their belts and &lt;a href=\"battle%20axe\"&gt;battle axe&lt;/a&gt;s in hand\". These soldiers ensued a bridge of communication with the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Transylvania%20%281570%E2%80%931711%29\"&gt;Principality of Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;, and made Aaron's Moldavia heavily dependent on Transylvanian assistance.\nAaron soon faced rebellions of the local boyars and burghers. Some of these were probably instigated by brothers Bogdan Iona\u0219cu and Peter the Cossack, which may have prompted Aaron to turn against another kingmaking financier, &lt;a href=\"Bartolomeo%20Brutti\"&gt;Bartolomeo Brutti&lt;/a&gt;. Brutti, also known as a supporter of Moldavian Catholicism, was executed in April 1592; his entire estate, valued at 30,000 ducats, was confiscated by the state. Aaron probably confiscated Brutti's villages of &lt;a href=\"S%C4%83b%C4%83oani\"&gt;S\u0103b\u0103oani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"R%C4%83c%C4%83ciuni\"&gt;Berinde\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, largely settled by Catholic &lt;a href=\"Csangos\"&gt;Csangos&lt;/a&gt;; these later appeared as property of the Orthodox monks of &lt;a href=\"Secu%20Monastery\"&gt;Secu&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May, after riots in &lt;a href=\"L%C4%83pu%C8%99na%20County%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;L\u0103pu\u0219na&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orhei%20County%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Orhei&lt;/a&gt;, Aaron ordered the execution of \"treasonous\" courtiers, \"&lt;a href=\"Logothete\"&gt;Logothete&lt;/a&gt;\" Zaharia B\u00e2rl\u0103deanu and \"&lt;a href=\"Vornic\"&gt;Vornic&lt;/a&gt;\" Condrea Bucium. He failed to capture the \"&lt;a href=\"Burgrave\"&gt;P\u00e2rc\u0103lab&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Suceava\"&gt;Suceava&lt;/a&gt;, Andrei Corcodel, who fled over the border into Ottoman territory. Aaron then gathered the &lt;a href=\"Moldavian%20military%20forces\"&gt;Moldavian military forces&lt;/a&gt; and organized the offensive against Bogdan Iona\u0219cu. The armies clashed on the &lt;a href=\"R%C4%83ut%20River\"&gt;R\u0103ut&lt;/a&gt;, in present-day &lt;a href=\"Moldova\"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt;. Bogdan was defeated, mutilated, and sent to live in a monastery; his followers were decimated. The rebellion also prompted Aaron to operate changes in L\u0103pu\u0219na's administration, which had shown itself to be permeated by Brutti's retinue.\nThe violence and instability called for the &lt;a href=\"Sublime%20Porte\"&gt;Porte&lt;/a&gt;'s direct intervention. In June, Murad heard a complaint from the boyars, but was unpersuaded. He informed the petitioners that they risked losing their country's privileges, and that he considered making Moldavia into a Muslim \"&lt;a href=\"Eyalet\"&gt;beylerbeylik&lt;/a&gt;\". However, the Ottomans \"always sacked those Princes unlucky enough to have sparked an unrest\". They eventually deposed Aaron, before June 20, at which date the creditors were already pleading for him to be reinstated. As noted by Iorga, the intrigue involved his alleged nephew, Alexandru III. There was also a competition between Bogdan Iona\u0219cu and Peter the Cossack, again centered on \"hara\u00e7\" offers; Alexandru emerged as the winner, but was then usurped by his uncle Peter, who invaded the country alongside &lt;a href=\"Zaporozhian%20Cossacks\"&gt;Cossacks&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Zaporizhian%20Sich\"&gt;Zaporizhian Sich&lt;/a&gt;. With support from his creditors, and, this time, with crucial backing from the Janissaries, Aaron was reappointed ruler for the second time after a two-month absence. Sultan Murad asked his other vassal, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvanian Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%20B%C3%A1thory\"&gt;Sigismund B\u00e1thory&lt;/a&gt;, to depose Peter. The expedition, led by &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A1sp%C3%A1r%20Sibrik\"&gt;G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Sibrik&lt;/a&gt;, ensured that Aaron could return to a pacified Moldavia.\nInto the Holy League.\nIn September 1592, Aaron sent a trusted Moldavian, the \"Postelnic\" Oprea, to seize control of the court in &lt;a href=\"Ia%C8%99i\"&gt;Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt; and prepare the terrain for his arrival. As \"&lt;a href=\"Ispravnic\"&gt;Ispravnic&lt;/a&gt;\" of the throne, Oprea tied but failed to capture a hostile boyar, &lt;a href=\"Nestor%20Ureche\"&gt;Nestor Ureche&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to cross the border into &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Poland\u2013Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;. The loyalists also captured Prince Peter, Aaron's alleged half-brother, after a battle outside Ia\u0219i. Aaron had him mutilated, then sent him to Murad, who ordered him impaled on hooks. The restored Prince followed up on his old policies, and, by February 1593, had confiscated Corcodel's estates in such places as &lt;a href=\"Puie%C8%99ti%2C%20Vaslui\"&gt;L\u0103le\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clim%C4%83u%C8%9Bi\"&gt;Clim\u0103u\u021bi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"B%C4%83l%C8%9Bi\"&gt;Z\u0103v\u0103deni&lt;/a&gt;. At some point before April 1593 and December 1594, Aaron executed another rebellious boyar, Vartic, who had put up resistance in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Carpathians\"&gt;Eastern Carpathians&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 1592 return also encouraged anti-Catholicism in Moldavia, disassembling Brutti's contributions. Already by August, Aaron restored recognition for the Moldavian &lt;a href=\"Hussites\"&gt;Hussites&lt;/a&gt;, and reestablished &lt;a href=\"Moravian%20Church\"&gt;Brethren&lt;/a&gt; churches, closed down under Peter the Lame. This move may have been dictated by Ambassador Barton, who claimed that Aaron was effectively taking orders from the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; through English missionaries Thomas Wilcox and Richard Babynton. Before January 1593, Aaron finally clamped down on Catholicism itself, expelling the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Society of Jesus&lt;/a&gt; from Moldavia. Wilcox reported that such moved delighted the various Moldavian Protestants, \"who dailie praye for her Majestie's longe lif and good prosperitie\".\nAs argued to Maxim, Aaron's return marked Moldavia's passage into another era, resuming \"&lt;a href=\"Moldavian%E2%80%93Ottoman%20Wars\"&gt;anti-Ottoman struggles&lt;/a&gt;\" at a level of violence not seen since the times of &lt;a href=\"Petru%20Rare%C8%99\"&gt;Petru Rare\u0219&lt;/a&gt; (in the 1540s). Aaron was determined to end his cohabitation with the Ottomans, receiving offers for a military alliance from the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Clement%20VIII\"&gt;Pope Clement VIII&lt;/a&gt; and, sometime after, from Wallachia's &lt;a href=\"Michael%20the%20Brave\"&gt;Michael the Brave&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the new \"&lt;a href=\"Holy%20League%20%281594%29\"&gt;Holy League&lt;/a&gt;\". He sent his own letters to the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Holy See&lt;/a&gt;, implying that his attitude toward Catholicism was now respectful and friendly, and even hinting to the &lt;a href=\"Primacy%20of%20Peter\"&gt;Primacy of Peter&lt;/a&gt;. In tandem, he embarked on a secretive dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Rudolf II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Emperor of the Romans&lt;/a&gt;, offering to join the alliance after receiving fail-safe guarantees. He also received reports from the imperial officer Valentin Prepostv\u00e1ry von Lok\u00e1cs, who informed him about the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sz%C3%A9kesfeh%C3%A9rv%C3%A1r%20%281593%29\"&gt;victory at Stuhlwei\u00dfenburg&lt;/a&gt;. Prepostv\u00e1ry invited him to take up arms as a successor to &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20III%20of%20Moldavia\"&gt;Stephen the Great&lt;/a&gt;, \"whose warrior fame and name live on to this day\". In his reply, Aaron expressed pleasure, but asked for Emperor Rudolf to contact him in person.\nOn January 28, 1593, unaware of such dealings, Sultan Murad had set high tributary obligations for Moldavia, which may have included a hike of 30,000 sequins. In summer of that year, Moldavia became a secondary theater for the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Turkish%20War\"&gt;Long Turkish War&lt;/a&gt;, declared by Rudolf and his allies against the Ottomans. In December 1593, Zaporizhians raided &lt;a href=\"Silistra%20Eyalet\"&gt;Silistra Eyalet&lt;/a&gt;, devastating areas around &lt;a href=\"Bender%2C%20Moldova\"&gt;Bender&lt;/a&gt;. They were led by \"&lt;a href=\"Hetmans%20of%20Ukrainian%20Cossacks\"&gt;Hetman&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Hryhoriy%20Loboda\"&gt;Hryhoriy Loboda&lt;/a&gt;, who, according to a 17th-century source, were assisted by the former Moldavian \"Postelnic\", Mele\u0219an. The &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20Khanate\"&gt;Crimean Khanate&lt;/a&gt;, as an Ottoman proxy, led a counteroffensive into &lt;a href=\"Pokuttya\"&gt;Pokuttya&lt;/a&gt;, which was a bridgehead into &lt;a href=\"Partium\"&gt;Partium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281526%E2%80%931867%29\"&gt;Royal Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron informed Transylvania of this move, allowing Cossacks and Hungarians to contain that threat. One of his letters went to the city government of &lt;a href=\"Bistri%C8%9Ba\"&gt;Beszterce (Bistri\u021ba)&lt;/a&gt;, advising it to close down and guard the road from &lt;a href=\"Baia\"&gt;Baia&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs recounted by Michael's physician and diplomat &lt;a href=\"Balthasar%20Walther\"&gt;Balthasar Walther&lt;/a&gt;, Aaron welcomed at Ia\u0219i &lt;a href=\"Aleksandar%20Komulovi%C4%87\"&gt;Aleksandar Komulovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, the papal envoy, and then, in a coordinated move with Michael, stopped paying his \"hara\u00e7\"; other sources mention direct negotiations between the Wallachian and Moldavian rulers, arranged by and through &lt;a href=\"Preda%20Buzescu\"&gt;Preda&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stroe%20Buzescu\"&gt;Stroe Buzescu&lt;/a&gt;. Other reports suggest that Komulovi\u0107 first met Aaron and Michael's envoys to Transylvania in February 1594, at &lt;a href=\"Alba%20Iulia\"&gt;Fey\u00e9rv\u00e1r (B\u0103lgrad)&lt;/a&gt;, though it is unclear if they sealed a working alliance there and then. The League had also attracted similar pledges from Sigismund B\u00e1thory, who, as noted by various scholars, had been recognized by Aaron as his new &lt;a href=\"Homage%20%28feudal%29\"&gt;liege&lt;/a&gt;. Others dispute that this vassalage was ever anything more than B\u00e1thory's wishful thinking. In March Moldavia also received an imperial embassy led by Giovanni di Marini Poli, or \"Raguseus\". The treaty he signed with Aaron created the possibility for Moldavia to be placed under &lt;a href=\"imperial%20immediacy\"&gt;imperial immediacy&lt;/a&gt;; at this stage, Aaron was only required to spy on the Ottomans.\nRevolt.\nDuring those weeks, Rudolf involved Moldavia's court in his effort to forge an alliance that would strike the Ottomans in &lt;a href=\"Dobruja\"&gt;Dobruja&lt;/a&gt; and move toward &lt;a href=\"Adrianople\"&gt;Adrianople&lt;/a&gt;. The core of the invasion was to be a Wallachian\u2013Moldavian\u2013Zaporizhian alliance, but Rudolf also hoped to attract the &lt;a href=\"Tsardom%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Tsardom of Russia&lt;/a&gt; and at least some support from the Poles. In April, Komulovi\u0107 met with the Cossack &lt;a href=\"Severyn%20Nalyvaiko\"&gt;Severyn Nalyvaiko&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kamianets-Podilskyi\"&gt;Kamianets-Podilskyi&lt;/a&gt;, and the Sich was formally co-opted into the League. Aaron shared these goals, dispatching his own delegation\u2014comprising Kalogeras and the new \"Logothete\", Cr\u0103ciun Grigorcea\u2014to negotiate with the Zaporizhians. His court was visited by the Russian merchant &lt;a href=\"Trifon%20Korobeynikov\"&gt;Trifon Korobeynikov&lt;/a&gt;, who records that the Prince stood up to honor &lt;a href=\"Feodor%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Tsar Feodor&lt;/a&gt; at every mention of his name. Aaron also made Vorsi his ambassador to &lt;a href=\"Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to draw Polish support for the uprising. This initiative was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Zamoyski\"&gt;Jan Zamoyski&lt;/a&gt;, who pursued a pro-Ottoman line and tried to quell a &lt;a href=\"Nalyvaiko%20Uprising\"&gt;Cossack insurgency&lt;/a&gt;, and who probably informed Murad of Aaron's betrayal.\nThe Ottomans again asked from their Crimean vassals that they intervene. &lt;a href=\"%C4%9Eaz%C4%B1%20II%20Giray\"&gt;\u011eaz\u0131 II Giray&lt;/a&gt; submitted, staging a raid on Moldavia: in June 1594, the Crimeans encircled Aron in his capital of Ia\u0219i, then devastated the surrounding region. Zamoyski made a perfunctory show of support for Moldavia, sending in the &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20the%20Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Polish-Lithuanian army&lt;/a&gt;. In August, it had only reached as far south as &lt;a href=\"Chernivtsi\"&gt;Cern\u0103u\u021bi (Chernivtsi)&lt;/a&gt;. The Crimean hordes were nevertheless weakened by the Cossack invasion into their own base, and were vulnerable to attacks when grazing their horses. In July, Cossack troops returned to Moldavia. They were nominally allies of the Empire and responded to Komulovi\u0107, but were in practice uncontrollable; they also regarded Aaron as a facilitator of the Crimeans, who had allowed Giray passage through Moldavia. Loboda and Nalyvaiko fused their armies, conquering and razing &lt;a href=\"%C8%9Au%C8%9Bora\"&gt;\u021au\u021bora&lt;/a&gt; before taking Ia\u0219i, destroying Moldavia's artillery in the process. Aaron, having panicked, barricaded himself in &lt;a href=\"Putna%20Monastery\"&gt;Putna Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. He eventually agreed to pay Loboda a large ransom in exchange for his subjects' safety. With help from B\u00e1thory and \"Logothete\" Ivan Norocea, Aaron was also able to crush another insurgency by pro-Ottoman boyars. Their attempt at a coup formed part of a larger plot involving &lt;a href=\"Balthasar%20B%C3%A1thory\"&gt;Balthasar B\u00e1thory&lt;/a&gt;, nephew of the Transylvanian Prince, and &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A1ndor%20Kendi\"&gt;S\u00e1ndor Kendi&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy September 1594, the League project seemed abortive, with the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Army\"&gt;Ottoman Army&lt;/a&gt; winning control of &lt;a href=\"Gy%C5%91r\"&gt;Raab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kom%C3%A1rno\"&gt;Komorn&lt;/a&gt;, from where it could threaten &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;. According to Michael the Brave's own recollection, the sultan demanded that he and Aaron \"unite\" with Ottoman and Crimean troops from Dobruja, and \"annihilate\" Transylvania. During that interval, Aaron secretly traveled to parlay with the Transylvanians, passing through &lt;a href=\"Bra%C8%99ov\"&gt;Corona (Bra\u0219ov)&lt;/a&gt; on September 24.\nHe and Michael began coordinating their open rebellion, which would open a new battlefield behind Ottoman lines. Their uprising began on November 13, with Ottoman garrisons in both countries being overpowered and massacred. In Aaron's territories, victims included four \"&lt;a href=\"%C3%87avu%C5%9F\"&gt;\u00c7avu\u015f&lt;/a&gt;lar\", whom Murad had sent over with gifts, hoping to restore Ottoman suzerainty amiably. By then, the Prince had also resumed his practice of dealing violently with his earlier sponsors, executing without trial a Greek banker, Nestor Nevridis, and 19 of his Jewish creditors. He forfeited all payments on Barton and Ashkenazi's loans; when the latter arrived to complain in Ia\u0219i, Aaron had him arrested and sent as a prisoner to Transylvania.\nIn October, Pope Clement was informed that Aaron had \"joined with\" Michael and Prince B\u00e1thory\u2014the latter, however, presented this treaty as his annexation of both Wallachia and Moldavia. Sultan Murad formally declared war on all three countries on November 28, but Michael had the initiative throughout December. In January 1595, Moldavia signed an alliance with the Zaporizhians, being thus \"able to enlist them, if only in part, the Romanians' struggle for liberation.\" Aaron then moved against the Ottomans, joining forces with Michael and B\u00e1thory in their raiding of &lt;a href=\"Budjak\"&gt;Budjak&lt;/a&gt; and Dobruja. Polish writer &lt;a href=\"Bartosz%20Paprocki\"&gt;Bartosz Paprocki&lt;/a&gt; recounts that Aaron gathered a new cohort of recruits, promising them that they could keep all spoils of war they captured individually. He \"did not have a large army, but following his pledge his soldiers grew in numbers\"; one estimate counts 15,000 Moldavians, with an additional 5,000 Transylvanians. Overturning the tide, they killed as many as 12,000 Crimeans on the field of battle, and captured another 1,000. A &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Venice\"&gt;Venetian&lt;/a&gt; report of that period claims that Aaron thoroughly destroyed the Ottoman fortifications at Bender.\nAssisted by Transylvanians and Cossacks, the Moldavians took &lt;a href=\"Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi\"&gt;Cetatea Alb\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Izmail\"&gt;Ismail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kiliya\"&gt;Chilia&lt;/a&gt; by March; two detachments crossed over the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; and defeated the Crimeans in Dobruja, seizing &lt;a href=\"Isaccea\"&gt;Obluci\u021ba&lt;/a&gt;. According to various reports, the Ottoman Army, defeated by Michael at &lt;a href=\"Silistra\"&gt;Silistra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tutrakan\"&gt;Turtukai&lt;/a&gt;, included in its ranks &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20the%20Deaf\"&gt;Stephen the Deaf&lt;/a&gt;, sent in by the Porte to replace Aaron, and &lt;a href=\"%C8%98tefan%20Bogdan\"&gt;\u0218tefan Bogdan Sasul&lt;/a&gt;, who sought the crown of Wallachia. After this strike, Aaron had extended his rule into all of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Dobruja\"&gt;Northern Dobruja&lt;/a&gt;, and had captured an unexpectedly large loot, including 100 cannons taken at Ismail. Paprocki believes that \"8,000 Turks were killed in that battle\".\nDownfall and death.\nPrince B\u00e1thory was unpersuaded by Aaron's efforts, moved to have him deposed and replaced. According to Marini Poli, the Moldavian ruler was preparing for a separate peace with the Ottomans, being instigated into this by his Greek advisers, the \"enemies of Christendom\". The period witnessed the arrival in Moldavia of Nikephoros Didaskalos, who agitated against alliances with the Catholics, seeing them as tools for a restored communion with the Holy See. The Pope received news that Aaron intended to \"place himself and his belongings under [Poland's] protection\"; in contrast, Paprocki noted that Aaron was accused of conspiring mainly with &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20B%C3%A1thory\"&gt;Andrew B\u00e1thory&lt;/a&gt;, the Prince's cousin and main rival.\nA fragmentary Wallachian chronicle, copied by &lt;a href=\"Stoica%20Ludescu\"&gt;Stoica Ludescu&lt;/a&gt;, describes all such allegations of treason as \"mendacious charges\". Similarly, Xenopol notes that the accusation itself is incongruous, since Aaron had already made a public show of his disdain for Murad. He believes that Prince B\u00e1thory was in fact angered by Aaron having declined to swear &lt;a href=\"fealty\"&gt;fealty&lt;/a&gt; during a public ceremony, which was set to take place in Transylvania. A Transylvanian diplomat, Krist\u00f3f Kereszt\u00fari, had brought back news that Aaron only recognized as his sovereigns \"the Pope and His Sacred Imperial Majesty\", viewing B\u00e1thory as a mere colleague.\nThe instrument of Prince B\u00e1thory's coup was &lt;a href=\"%C8%98tefan%20R%C4%83zvan\"&gt;\u0218tefan R\u0103zvan&lt;/a&gt;, who had assumed control of Aaron's Hungarian guard. Famous for being a man of &lt;a href=\"Roma%20minority%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Romany (Gypsy)&lt;/a&gt; ethnicity, he had shown bravery in battle, but, according to Walther, was already \"perfidious\" toward his employer; according to Paprocki, he was B\u00e1thory's \"man of trust\" in Moldavia. Aaron and his family were captured and detained at Ia\u0219i by B\u00e1thory's men. As Xenopol notes, the populace never came to their rescue, still resenting the Prince \"for his earlier plunders\". The final day of his rule was April 23 or 24 (May 3 or 4 in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Style%20and%20New%20Style%20dates\"&gt;New Style&lt;/a&gt;). Upon replacing him, R\u0103zvan formally pledged not to hand territory back to the Ottomans. Witnesses of the day report that the new ruler had extremely little authority, with all tax revenue in Moldavia being collected by the Transylvanian treasury.\nAssisted by the Cossacks, B\u00e1thory also purged the Moldavian boyardom of its Polish-supporting members. An \"&lt;a href=\"avviso\"&gt;avviso&lt;/a&gt;\" of May 1595 suggests that Aaron had entrusted his \"sister\", who was most likely Orzechowska, to look after \"the principal fort\" in Moldavia. According to that source, she and her children were captured and murdered there by the new coup organizers. Various records indicate that Aaron and his remaining family were taken into Transylvania shortly after Orthodox Easter 1595. During this interval, he had contacts with the &lt;a href=\"Transylvanian%20Saxons\"&gt;Saxon&lt;/a&gt; community: between May 9 and 17, while the family lodged with Johann Hirscher of Corona, Aaron met and befriended chronicler &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Wei%C3%9F%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Michael Wei\u00df&lt;/a&gt;, who became his confidant. The former Prince was later imprisoned at &lt;a href=\"Martinuzzi%20Castle\"&gt;Martinuzzi Castle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vin%C8%9Bu%20de%20Jos\"&gt;Alvinc (Vin\u021bu de Jos)&lt;/a&gt;, where he spent the remainder of his life. The most precising dating of his death is May 1597.\nAs argued by historian Marius Diaconescu, the new Moldo\u2013Wallachian\u2013Transylvanian alliances negotiated immediately after Aaron's downfall were effectively a union of the three countries under B\u00e1thory's scepter, and masterminded by &lt;a href=\"Istv%C3%A1n%20J%C3%B3sika\"&gt;Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3sika&lt;/a&gt;. However, according to Ludescu's narrative, Aaron's downfall soured relations between Wallachia and Transylvania: Michael, who was not involved in the plot, looked \"saddened\" by news of his friend's arrest. His death in custody was also a point of contention between the Transylvanians and Wallachians in the period leading up to Mihael's &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20%C8%98elimb%C4%83r\"&gt;conquest of Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;. As late as 1601, in his letters to Rudolf, Michael alleged that B\u00e1thory's betrayals of the Holy League included killing Aaron. In this account, the deposed Prince had been made to drink \"venom\". A similar narrative is provided by Wei\u00df, who further indicates J\u00f3sika as the principal culprit. Various modern historians also agree that Aaron may have indeed been assassinated.\nAccording to his own testimony, Michael had Aaron buried in the new Orthodox church at B\u0103lgrad, alongside a number of Wallachian boyars. In 1600, however, Michael's hold on the region was challenged by a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mir%C4%83sl%C4%83u\"&gt;Transylvanian civil war&lt;/a&gt;, opposing Michael to the B\u00e1thorys and to the Imperial warlord &lt;a href=\"Giorgio%20Basta\"&gt;Giorgio Basta&lt;/a&gt;. Basta recaptured B\u0103lgrad, and ordered the church vandalized. Aaron's remains were desecrated, or, as Michael notes: \"they dug up the bones [...] and cast them out; even pagans had refrained from such inhuman deeds.\"\nLegacy.\nVarious accounts from the 1600s include brief notes about Aaron having several children or \"sons\". Some confusion regarding survivors from Aaron's family was sparked by a &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Mantua\"&gt;Mantuan&lt;/a&gt; report of 1595, which claimed that his widow, \"&lt;a href=\"Doamna%20Velica\"&gt;Velica&lt;/a&gt;\", had remarried the Transylvanian courtier Fabio Genga. This information was refuted by other evidence, showing that Genga's wife was actually \"Logothete\" Norocea's daughter and sister-in-law of &lt;a href=\"Mihnea%20Turcitul\"&gt;Mihnea Turcitul&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron's real widow reunited with his stepson &lt;a href=\"Marcu%20Cercel\"&gt;Marcu Cercel&lt;/a&gt;, and together they made their way to &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, joining Michael's retinue before January 1598. A note by the Polish diplomat &lt;a href=\"Andrzej%20Tarnowski\"&gt;Andrzej Tarnowski&lt;/a&gt; also mentions them traveling together with Aron's natural son, whose name he renders as Ilia\u0219. Scholar Maria-Venera R\u0103dulescu finds this an unreliable account, and argues that Tarnowski actually refers to Marcu's brother Iona\u0219cu, who was not Aaron's blood relative.\nA discredited theory, proposed by historian Ilie Minea, argues that Tarnowski's \"Marcu\" refers to Aaron's natural son, who had the same name as Cercel. Other scholarship traced the events of Cercel's subsequent life: he remained a close associate of Michael; in July\u2013September 1600, when Michael conquered and held Moldavia, he reigned as a subordinate Prince in Ia\u0219i. In competition with his brother Radu Petru, he also continued to claim the throne of Wallachia into the 1610s. By 1614, a Venetian adventurer, Zuanbattista Locadello, was hoping to obtain the Moldavian crown, presenting himself as Aaron's son. His conflict with the \"&lt;a href=\"Bailo\"&gt;Bailo&lt;/a&gt;\" brought his arrest by the Ottomans and death in custody. Taking the Moldavian throne in 1634, &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Lupu\"&gt;Vasile Lupu&lt;/a&gt;, who was the son of &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Coci\"&gt;Nicolae Coci&lt;/a&gt; and therefore Albanian, also encouraged rumors that he was actually Aaron's illegitimate child.\nOne more tradition claims Aaron as the ancestor of &lt;a href=\"Petru%20Pavel%20Aron\"&gt;Petru Pavel Aron&lt;/a&gt;, an 18th-century Romanian intellectual and bishop of the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Greek%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Transylvanian Greek Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;. This claim was recorded by scholar &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20%C8%98incai\"&gt;Gheorghe \u0218incai&lt;/a&gt;, who commented that it was \"not baseless\", and explored in more depth by &lt;a href=\"Iosif%20Sterca-%C8%98ulu%C8%9Biu\"&gt;Iosif Sterca-\u0218ulu\u021biu&lt;/a&gt;, who was an Aron on his mother's side. According to the latter, Prince Aaron and Bishop Aron were collaterally related, from two lines originating with Aron of Pozsony.\nAaron's alliance with Michael in mid 1594 incidentally marks the final point of the Moldavian historical epic, as told by &lt;a href=\"Grigore%20Ureche\"&gt;Grigore Ureche&lt;/a&gt;, and the first chapter of its continuation by &lt;a href=\"Miron%20Costin\"&gt;Miron Costin&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Agapia\"&gt;Agapia&lt;/a&gt;, a local legend calls a stone landmark with faint carvings \"Aron's Rock\", claiming it as a monument to Nicanor's punishment and its avenging by the Prince. His legacy in culture also includes his sponsoring of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Nicholas%20Church%2C%20Bra%C8%99ov\"&gt;St. Nicholas Church&lt;/a&gt; and of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Romanian%20School\"&gt;First Romanian School&lt;/a&gt;, both of them in &lt;a href=\"%C8%98cheii%20Bra%C8%99ovului\"&gt;\u0218cheii Bra\u0219ovului&lt;/a&gt;. This activity preoccupied him during late 1594, and again during his Transylvanian exile.\nIn his native Moldavia, Aaron was primarily remembered as a \"&lt;a href=\"ktitor\"&gt;ktitor&lt;/a&gt;\" of the eponymous &lt;a href=\"Aroneanu%20Church\"&gt;Aroneanu Church&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Ciric%20River\"&gt;Ciric Valley&lt;/a&gt;\u2014though this was most likely first built by his alleged father, L\u0103pu\u0219neanu. Ureche sees the church's rebuilding, which he dates to &lt;a href=\"Anno%20Mundi\"&gt;Anno Mundi&lt;/a&gt; 7102 (1594), as evidence that Aaron was finally atoning \"for his many sins [and] trying to avert his punishment.\" As noted by Iorga, the Prince purposefully avoided making this establishment into a \"&lt;a href=\"metochion\"&gt;metochion&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Athos\"&gt;Mount Athos&lt;/a&gt;, resenting the Greek monks' accumulation of wealth. Included by Nicolescu among the more innovative buildings of late-medieval Moldavian art, with a typically Wallachian &lt;a href=\"Church%20porch\"&gt;porch&lt;/a&gt;, Aroneanu borrows features from &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20architecture\"&gt;Ottoman architecture&lt;/a&gt;, including elements of &lt;a href=\"tessellation\"&gt;tessellation&lt;/a&gt; which also influenced later work at &lt;a href=\"%C8%98tefan%20cel%20Mare%2C%20Bac%C4%83u\"&gt;R\u0103deana&lt;/a&gt;. The building was heavily deteriorated and vandalized during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Jassy%E2%80%93Kishinev%20Offensive\"&gt;Soviet incursion of August 1944&lt;/a&gt;, and later restored; its name survives in the appellation of a surrounding village, also known as &lt;a href=\"Aroneanu\"&gt;Aroneanu&lt;/a&gt;. Its arms, adopted in 2004, include a visual reference to Prince Aaron (a &lt;a href=\"Chief%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;chief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ermine%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;ermine&lt;/a&gt;).\nArt historian Vasile Dr\u0103gu\u021b proposes that the late-medieval Princes who \"made anti-Ottoman struggle their supreme policy objective\" were also attuned to Western figurative art, introducing its canons in their respective countries. A Western-style portrait of Prince Aaron, painted in 1594, is kept at the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20National%20Museum\"&gt;Hungarian National Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;. The piece is a relevant source for the &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Moldavia\"&gt;coat of arms of Moldavia&lt;/a&gt;, depicting an &lt;a href=\"aurochs\"&gt;aurochs&lt;/a&gt; head, &lt;a href=\"Tincture%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;blazoned \"proper\"&lt;/a&gt;, on azure shield, with one star, gules. Monochrome heraldic objects left by Aron include a seal he used in May 1593, which is also the first ever visual association between the Moldavian aurochs head and a &lt;a href=\"Sun%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;."
