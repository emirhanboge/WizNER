    "text": "Smit is a &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"occupational%20surname\"&gt;occupational surname&lt;/a&gt;. It represents an archaic spelling of the Dutch word \"smid\" for \"&lt;a href=\"Smith%20%28metalwork%29\"&gt;smith&lt;/a&gt;\" (metal worker) and is the Dutch equivalent of the English surname &lt;a href=\"Smith%20%28surname%29\"&gt;Smith&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrequency of occurrence in general populations.\nInformation for surname frequency in the Netherlands is limited by the end of comprehensive census taking in the year 1971. The most recent readily available information is based on the 1947 census, for which both raw census data and surname frequency data have been made available to the general public. In 1947 there were 29,783 recorded people with the surname Smit, while the general census provides a figure of 9,519,000 as the 1947 population. Working with this data the frequency of the Smit surname in the Netherlands in 1947 can be calculated to be ~0.313% or ~3,130 of every 1,000,000 people. By comparison, &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20name%23Most%20common%20Dutch%20surnames\"&gt;the most common Dutch surname&lt;/a&gt; in the 1947 data was &lt;a href=\"De%20Jong%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;de Jong&lt;/a&gt;, which had a frequency of ~0.580%.\nAn imperfect comparison can be made to primary &lt;a href=\"English-speaking%20countries\"&gt;English-speaking countries&lt;/a&gt; as of 1998 based on research by &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;The National Trust&lt;/a&gt;. In 1998, the highest frequency was observed in New Zealand as 97.18 occurrences per million people, or ~1/30th the rate found in the Netherlands of 50 years before. Among the nations examined in the National Trust study, relative frequencies for 1991 were: New Zealand &gt; Australia \u2245 Canada \u226b United States &gt; Northern Ireland &gt; Great Britain &gt; Republic of Ireland. The substantial difference between Canada and the United States indicated in this series is approximately 3.5 fold."
