He was &lt;a href=\"bowled\"&gt;bowled&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"Duck%20%28cricket%29\"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt; in the only Irish innings. He returned to the Ireland side in June 1923, again playing against Scotland in a first-class match, also playing against &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. In 1924, he played for Ireland a fourth time, again against Wales and also played his only first-class match for &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20University%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Dublin University&lt;/a&gt; in June against &lt;a href=\"Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Northamptonshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe became a more regular fixture in the Irish team from 1925. That year he played against Scotland, the &lt;a href=\"Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;MCC&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Lord's Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt; and Wales.

He captained Ireland against the West Indies in 1928, a match which Ireland won. It remains their only victory against a Test nation in a first-class match, though they have beaten the West Indies twice since in one-day matches. A match against &lt;a href=\"Julien%20Cahn\"&gt;Julien Cahn's XI&lt;/a&gt; in 1930 would be his last for four years.\nHe returned to the Ireland side in August 1934, playing against the MCC in a first-class match before spending a further three years out of the Ireland side. His last two matches for Ireland were two against &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in September 1937, the first of which was his final first-class match.\nStatistics.\nIn all matches for Ireland, Ganly scored 831 &lt;a href=\"Run%20%28cricket%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; at an &lt;a href=\"Batting%20average%20%28cricket%29\"&gt;average&lt;/a&gt; of 19.79, with a top score of 83 against the MCC in August 1926.

He captained Ireland eight times.\nPost playing career.\nGanly served as president of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Cricket%20Union\"&gt;Irish Cricket Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1965. He died in a shooting accident on 22 July 1976.\nRugby Union.\nGanly first played for the &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Ireland national rugby union team&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;Five Nations&lt;/a&gt; in 1927. He played in all four games, scoring two &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;tries&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; and one against &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.
