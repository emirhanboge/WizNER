    "text": "ICPS is an annual conference of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Association%20of%20Physics%20Students\"&gt;International Association of Physics Students&lt;/a&gt; (IAPS). Usually, up to 500 students from all over the world attend the event, which takes place in another country every year in August. The event includes the opportunity for students at bachelor, master and doctoral level to present their research, whilst listening and interacting with invited speakers of international reputation. During the event, usually lasting between 5 and 7 days, the IAPS holds its &lt;a href=\"Annual%20General%20Meeting\"&gt;Annual General Meeting&lt;/a&gt; (AGM) and elects a new Executive Committee. The choice of the host country of ICPS is made two years in advance.\nProgram.\nThe main component of the conference consists of lectures given by the students themselves for other students. Guest lectures held by invited speakers and lab tours complete the scientific program. Further activities include city tours, excursions and social events. The participation fee is usually close to \u20ac200 per person, including accommodation, food and any extra activity organised by the local committee.\nConference venues.\nThe following list contains the venues of the ICPS conferences\nHistory.\nIn 1985 a group of Hungarian students decided to host a gathering of Physics students from all over the world. This resulted in the first International Conference of Physics Students in 1986. Due to the large success of this conference a second meeting in 1987 was organized in &lt;a href=\"Debrecen\"&gt;Debrecen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. At this occasion the International Association of Physics Students was founded. Furthermore, it was decided to have an International meeting annually.\nSince then, 30 conferences have taken place.\nICPS 2017.\nThe ICPS 2017 took place in Turin, between August 7 and August 14, hosted by the Italian Association of Physics Students (&lt;a href=\"Associazione%20Italiana%20Studenti%20di%20Fisica\"&gt;Associazione Italiana Studenti di Fisica&lt;/a&gt;) (AISF). The Italian Organizing Committee prepared the formal bid to host the conference only one year after its foundation, when it was not yet formally recognized as a National Committee of IAPS. The event was mostly held at the &lt;a href=\"Campus%20Einaudi\"&gt;Campus Einaudi&lt;/a&gt;, with an opening ceremony hosted at the &lt;a href=\"Cavallerizza%20Reale\"&gt;Cavallerizza Reale&lt;/a&gt; and the Rector's Palace of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Turin\"&gt;University of Turin&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately 450 students attended the event and almost 50 volunteers from AISF were involved in the conference activities. Notable guests were &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Aprile\"&gt;Elena Aprile&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Columbia%20University\"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Cowley\"&gt;Steve Cowley&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Vittori\"&gt;Roberto Vittori&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"European%20Space%20Agency\"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"James%20Kakalios\"&gt;James Kakalios&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Minnesota\"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, author of the popular book &lt;a href=\"The%20Physics%20of%20Superheroes\"&gt;The Physics of Superheroes&lt;/a&gt;). Young invited speakers included &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Tombesi\"&gt;Francesco Tombesi&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"NASA\"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Agnese%20Bissi\"&gt;Agnese Bissi&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Prino\"&gt;Francesco Prino&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Turin\"&gt;University of Turin&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe program of ICPS 2017 comprised visits to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Centre%20for%20Oncological%20Hadrontherapy\"&gt;National Centre for Oncological Hadrontherapy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pavia\"&gt;Pavia&lt;/a&gt;, traditional wine cellars, the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Italian Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Genoa\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Venaria%20Reale\"&gt;Venaria Reale&lt;/a&gt; palace, the &lt;a href=\"Sacra%20di%20San%20Michele\"&gt;Sacra di San Michele&lt;/a&gt; Abbey and a number of innovation hubs in Northern &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nICPS 2016.\nThe ICPS 2016 took place from August, 11th to August, 17th in &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; and was hosted by physics students from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Malta\"&gt;University of Malta&lt;/a&gt;.
