    "text": "Kangju (; &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Han%20Chinese\"&gt;Eastern Han Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: \"k\u02b0\u0251\u014b-k\u0268\u0251\" &lt; *\"kh\u00e2\u014b-ka\" (c. 140 BCE)) was the Chinese name of a kingdom in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt; during the first half of the &lt;a href=\"first%20millennium\"&gt;first millennium&lt;/a&gt; CE. The name \"Kangju\" is now generally regarded as a variant or mutated form of the name &lt;a href=\"Sogdiana\"&gt;Sogdiana&lt;/a&gt;. According to contemporaneous Chinese sources, Kangju was the second most powerful state in &lt;a href=\"Transoxiana\"&gt;Transoxiana&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Yuezhi\"&gt;Yuezhi&lt;/a&gt;. Its people, known in Chinese as the K\u0101ng (\u5eb7), were evidently of &lt;a href=\"Proto-Indo-Europeans\"&gt;Indo-European origins&lt;/a&gt;, spoke an &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Iranian%20language\"&gt;Eastern Iranian language&lt;/a&gt;, and had a semi-nomadic way of life. They were probably identical to the &lt;a href=\"Sogdians\"&gt;Sogdians&lt;/a&gt;, or other Iranian groups closely related to them, such as the &lt;a href=\"Asii\"&gt;Asii&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nAccording to John E. Hill, a historian specialising in ancient Central Asia, \"Kangju (W-G: K'ang-ch\u00fc) \u5eb7\u5c45\" was in or near the \"&lt;a href=\"Talas%20River\"&gt;Talas basin&lt;/a&gt;, [modern] &lt;a href=\"Tashkent\"&gt;Tashkent&lt;/a&gt; and Sogdiana\". (According to &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Pulleyblank\"&gt;Edwin Pulleyblank&lt;/a&gt;, Beitian \u2013 the summer capital of Kangju \u2013 was in or near modern metropolitan Tashkent.)\nIt is not clear whether the Chinese name \u5eb7\u5c45 Kangju was intended to transcribe an ethnic name, or to be descriptive, or both. \u5c45 \"ju\" can mean: 'seat', 'central place of activity or authority; 'to settle down,' 'residence,' or 'to occupy (militarily).'... The term, therefore, could simply mean \"the abode of the Kang,\" or \"territory occupied by the Kang.\" ... As \"kang\" \u5eb7 means 'well-being', 'peaceful,' 'happy;' 'settle', 'stability,' Kangju can be translated as the 'Peaceful Land,' or 'Abode of the Peaceful (People).' ... Even if the name Kangju was originally an attempt to transcribe the sounds of a foreign name, it would still have carried the sense of a peaceful place to Chinese speakers, and the name 'Kang' would have had overtones of a peaceful people.\nLater Chinese sources, during the &lt;a href=\"Sui%20Dynasty\"&gt;Sui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Dynasty\"&gt;Tang&lt;/a&gt; dynasties, refer to Kangju as the State of Kang () By that time it was part of the &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6kt%C3%BCrk%20Khaganate\"&gt;G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khaganate&lt;/a&gt;.\nPulleyblank linked Kangju to the &lt;a href=\"Tocharian%20languages\"&gt;Tocharian A&lt;/a&gt; word \"k\u0101\u1e45ka-\", probably meaning \"stone\" and proposed that the Kangju were originally &lt;a href=\"Tocharians\"&gt;Tocharians&lt;/a&gt; who had migrated westward into Sogdia and established themselves in &lt;a href=\"Tashkent%23History%20as%20Chach\"&gt;Chach&lt;/a&gt; (modern &lt;a href=\"Tashkent\"&gt;Tashkent&lt;/a&gt;). Pulleyblank also suggested that the &lt;a href=\"Jie%20people\"&gt;Ji\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; (\u7faf) tribe Qi\u0101ngq\u00fa (\u7f8c\u6e20) might be Kangju people who had been incorporated into the Xiongnu tribal confederation. Pulleyblank further connected Kangju to K\u00e0nji\u00e9 \u77b0\u7faf (*\"Kamkar\"?) and the name \"Kankar\" given to the lower &lt;a href=\"Syr%20Darya\"&gt;Yaxartes&lt;/a&gt; by Persian geographer &lt;a href=\"ibn%20Khordadbeh\"&gt;ibn Khordadbeh&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Josef%20Markwart\"&gt;Joseph Marquart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Omeljan%20Pritsak\"&gt;Omeljan Pritsak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20B.%20Golden\"&gt;Peter B. Golden&lt;/a&gt; have noted phonetic similarities between Kangju and Kengeres mentioned in the Orkhon inscriptions, the Kangar\u00e2y\u00ea in Transcaucasia, the city of Keng\u00fc Tarban, and the three &lt;a href=\"Pechenegs\"&gt;Pecheneg&lt;/a&gt; tribes collectively known as &lt;a href=\"Kangar%20Union\"&gt;Kangar&lt;/a&gt; mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20VII%20Porphyrogenitus\"&gt;Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, all those connections remain hypothetical.\nArchaeological evidence suggests that the Kangju spoke an &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Iranian%20language\"&gt;Eastern Iranian language&lt;/a&gt;, which was probably identical to &lt;a href=\"Sogdian%20language\"&gt;Sogdian&lt;/a&gt;, or derived from it.\nHistory.\nAccording to 2nd century BCE &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; sources, Kangju lay north of the &lt;a href=\"Dayuan\"&gt;Dayuan&lt;/a&gt; and west of the &lt;a href=\"Wusun\"&gt;Wusun&lt;/a&gt;, bordering the &lt;a href=\"Yuezhi\"&gt;Yuezhi&lt;/a&gt; in the south. Their territory covered the region of the &lt;a href=\"Ferghana%20Valley\"&gt;Ferghana Valley&lt;/a&gt; and the area between the &lt;a href=\"Amu%20Darya\"&gt;Amu Darya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Syr%20Darya\"&gt;Syr Darya&lt;/a&gt; rivers, with the core territory along the middle Syr Darya. Since historians of &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20the%20Great\"&gt;Alexander the Great&lt;/a&gt; do not mention the existence of any political power in the area except the &lt;a href=\"Khwarezm\"&gt;Khwarezm&lt;/a&gt;ians, the Kangju must have appeared a little later. It is likely that the state of the Kangju emerged during the great upheaval in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt; following the withdrawal of the &lt;a href=\"Yuezhi\"&gt;Yuezhi&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Gansu\"&gt;Gansu&lt;/a&gt; and then the &lt;a href=\"Ili%20Valley\"&gt;Ili Valley&lt;/a&gt; after their defeat by the &lt;a href=\"Xiongnu\"&gt;Xiongnu&lt;/a&gt; and Wusun respectively. Chinese sources state that the Kangju were tributiaries of the Yuezhi in the south and the Xiongnu in the east.\nKangju was mentioned by the Chinese traveller and diplomat &lt;a href=\"Zhang%20Qian\"&gt;Zhang Qian&lt;/a&gt; who visited the area c. 128 BCE, whose travels are documented in Chapter 123 of the \"&lt;a href=\"Shiji\"&gt;Shiji&lt;/a&gt;\" (whose author, &lt;a href=\"Sima%20Qian\"&gt;Sima Qian&lt;/a&gt;, died c. 90 BCE):\n\"Kangju is situated some 2,000 li [832 kilometers] northwest of Dayuan. Its people are nomads and resemble the Yuezhi in their customs. They have 80,000 or 90,000 skilled archers. The country is small, and borders Dayuan (&lt;a href=\"Ferghana\"&gt;Ferghana&lt;/a&gt;). It acknowledges sovereignty to the Yuezhi people in the South and the Xiongnu in the East.\nQian also visited a land known to the Chinese as &lt;a href=\"Yancai\"&gt;Yancai&lt;/a&gt; \u5944\u8521 (literally \"vast steppe\"), which lay north-west of the Kangju. The people of Yancai and were said to resemble the Kangju in their customs:\nYancai lies some 2,000 \"&lt;a href=\"Li%20%28Chinese%20unit%29\"&gt;li&lt;/a&gt;\" (832 km) northwest of Kangju (centered on &lt;a href=\"Hazrat-e%20Turkestan\"&gt;Turkestan&lt;/a&gt; at Beitian). The people are nomads and their customs are generally similar to those of the people of Kangju. The country has over 100,000 archer warriors, and borders a great shoreless lake [perhaps what is now known as the Northern Sea (&lt;a href=\"Aral%20Sea\"&gt;Aral Sea&lt;/a&gt;, distance between &lt;a href=\"Tashkent\"&gt;Tashkent&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Aralsk\"&gt;Aralsk&lt;/a&gt; is about 866 km].\nBy the time of the \"&lt;a href=\"Hanshu\"&gt;Hanshu&lt;/a&gt;\" (which covers the period from 206 BCE to 23 CE), Kangju had expanded considerably to a nation of some 600,000 individuals, with 120,000 men able to bear arms. Kangju was clearly now a major power in its own right. By this time it had gained control of Dayuan and &lt;a href=\"Sogdiana\"&gt;Sogdiana&lt;/a&gt; in which it controlled \u201cfive lesser kings\u201d (\u5c0f\u738b\u4e94).\nIn 101 BCE, the Kangju allied themselves with the Dayuan, helping them preserve their independence against the &lt;a href=\"Han%20dynasty\"&gt;Han&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe account on the '&lt;a href=\"Western%20Regions\"&gt;Western Regions&lt;/a&gt;' in the &lt;a href=\"Han%20Dynasty\"&gt;Han Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; Chinese chronicle, the \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Later%20Han\"&gt;Hou Hanshu&lt;/a&gt;\", 88 (covering the period 25\u2013220 and completed in the 5th century), based on a report to the Chinese emperor c. 125 CE, mentions that, at that time, Liyi \u6817\u5f0b (= Suyi \u7c9f\u5f0b) = Sogdiana, and both the \"old\" Yancai (which had changed its name to \"Alanliao\" and seems here to have expanded its territory to the &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20Sea\"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt;), and \"Yan\", a country to Yancai's north, as well as the strategic city of \"Northern Wuyi\" \u5317\u70cf\u4f0a (&lt;a href=\"Alexandria%20Eschate\"&gt;Alexandria Eschate&lt;/a&gt;, or modern &lt;a href=\"Khujand\"&gt;Khujand&lt;/a&gt;), were all dependent on Kangju.\nY. A. Zadneprovskiy suggests that the Kangju subjection of Yancai occurred in the 1st century BCE. Yancai is identified with the &lt;a href=\"Aorsi\"&gt;Aorsi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; records. Scholars have connected name Alanliao to &lt;a href=\"Alans\"&gt;Alans&lt;/a&gt;. The Yan people of the &lt;a href=\"Urals\"&gt;Urals&lt;/a&gt;, paid tribute to the Kangju in &lt;a href=\"fur\"&gt;fur&lt;/a&gt;s. The Kangju established close connections with the &lt;a href=\"Sarmatians\"&gt;Sarmatians&lt;/a&gt;, their western neighbors. The westward expansion of the Kangju obliged many of the Sarmatians to migrate further west, and it may therefore be concluded that the Kangju played a major in the &lt;a href=\"Migration%20Period\"&gt;great migrations of the time&lt;/a&gt;, which played a major role in world history. Through this expansion the Kangju gained control over key parts of the &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Route\"&gt;Silk Route&lt;/a&gt;. The Kangju state came to unite a number of regions which had &lt;a href=\"sedentary\"&gt;sedentary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"agricultural\"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nomadic\"&gt;nomadic&lt;/a&gt; populations. Although their territory was small, the fertility of the land and their sophisticated civilization enabled the Kangju to maintain a large population, becoming a major military power.\nThe Kangju were in frequent struggles with the Wusun, during which they in the mid 1st century BCE allied themselves with the northern Xiongnu. The Kangju ruler gave his daughter in marriage to the northern Xiongnu ruler Zhizhi while Zhizhi married the daughter of the Kangju ruler. The Xiongnu and Kangju were initially successful, besieging the Wusun in 42 BCE. The Han however intervened, defeating and killing the northern Xiongnu ruler in at Talas in 36 BCE (&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Zhizhi\"&gt;Battle of Zhizhi&lt;/a&gt;). The Kangju ruler was subsequently forced to send his son as a &lt;a href=\"hostage\"&gt;hostage&lt;/a&gt; to the Han court. Nevertheless, the Kangju continued to send embassies to the Han court and pursued an independent policy, which they were able to maintain until the 3rd century CE. Evidence of Kangju independence can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"coin\"&gt;coin&lt;/a&gt;age issued in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, during which they issued their own &lt;a href=\"currency\"&gt;currency&lt;/a&gt; which was similar to that of Khwarezm.\nThe biography of the Chinese General &lt;a href=\"Ban%20Chao\"&gt;Ban Chao&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Hou%20Hanshu\"&gt;Hou Hanshu&lt;/a&gt;\" says in 94 CE that the Yuezhi were arranging a marriage of their king with a Kangju princess. The Chinese then sent \"considerable presents of silks\" to the Yuezhi successfully gaining their help in pressuring the Kangju to stop supporting the king of &lt;a href=\"Kashgar\"&gt;Kashgar&lt;/a&gt; against them.\nThe 3rd century \"&lt;a href=\"Weil%C3%BCe\"&gt;Weil\u00fce&lt;/a&gt;\" states that Kangju was among a number of countries that \"had existed previously and neither grown nor shrunk.\" The Kangju subsequently declined. Around 270 CE they were subdued by the &lt;a href=\"Xionites\"&gt;Xionites&lt;/a&gt;. Like other Central Asian peoples, the Kangju probably became subsumed into the &lt;a href=\"Hephthalites\"&gt;Hephthalites&lt;/a&gt;.\nKangju was later known as the State of Kang (\u5eb7\u56fd) during the &lt;a href=\"Sui%20Dynasty\"&gt;Sui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Dynasty\"&gt;Tang&lt;/a&gt; dynasties. In the 8th century, some of them seem to have been adherents of &lt;a href=\"Manicheanism\"&gt;Manicheanism&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Han\"&gt;Book of Han&lt;/a&gt; describes the way of life of the Kangju elite. Its ruler spent his winter in the &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of Beitian, and his summers at his &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20Steppe\"&gt;steppe&lt;/a&gt; headquarters, which was a seven days' journey away on horseback.\nThe Kangju are regarded as an &lt;a href=\"Proto-Indo-Europeans\"&gt;Indo-European&lt;/a&gt; people, and are generally held to have been an &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20peoples\"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; people identical with the &lt;a href=\"Sogdians\"&gt;Sogdians&lt;/a&gt;, or the closely related &lt;a href=\"Asii\"&gt;Asii&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sinology\"&gt;Sinologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20G.%20Pulleyblank\"&gt;Edwin G. Pulleyblank&lt;/a&gt; has however suggested that the Kangju could have been &lt;a href=\"Tocharians\"&gt;Tocharians&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ruling elite of the Kangju consisted of &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20nomads\"&gt;nomadic&lt;/a&gt; tribes whose customs were very similar to those of the Yuezhi. Kangju burials of the early period have been excavated at Berk-kara and Tamd\u00ee, in which the dead were placed in pit-graves, often covered with logs, under &lt;a href=\"kurgan\"&gt;kurgan&lt;/a&gt; mounds. These graves often contain hand-made pots, iron swords, arrow-heads and jewellery. The burials show that the traditional culture of the Kangju resembled characteristics of the &lt;a href=\"Saka\"&gt;Saka&lt;/a&gt;. From the beginning of the Christian era \"catacomb graves\" (in shaft and chamber tombs) became widespread. This is seen from the burials of the Kaunchi and Dzhun cultures of the 1st to the 4th centuries CE, which are generally accepted as having belonged to the Kangju. The Kangju regarded the &lt;a href=\"Sheep\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt; as a noble animal.\nReferences from written sources and archaeological finds show that the Kangju reached a considerable level of agricultural sophistication. Much of the population consisted of a sedentary farming population. Wide canals from the Kangju period have been discovered, with the land area under &lt;a href=\"irrigation\"&gt;irrigation&lt;/a&gt; of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya being four times greater than today. The irrigation systems of Central Asia reached their highest levels of development under the Kangju-&lt;a href=\"Kushan%20Empire\"&gt;Kushans&lt;/a&gt; and was in fact superior to those fully developed in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchaeology.\nKaunchi culture.\nKangju appears to be a civilisation known to &lt;a href=\"Soviet\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; archaeologists as the \"Kaunchi Culture\", dating from the 2nd century BCE to the early 8th century CE, and centred on the middle course of the Syr Darya and its tributaries: the &lt;a href=\"Angren%20River\"&gt;Angren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chirchiq%20River\"&gt;Chirchik&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Keles%20River\"&gt;Keles&lt;/a&gt;. The culture was named after an ancient townsite now known as Kaunchi-Tepe, which was first studied by G. V. Grigoriev in 1934\u201337.\nSettlements of the Kaunchi culture were typically located in proximity to water and usually have monumental oval buildings in the center, at times with a defensive wall. The largest settlement was a 150 hectare city known apparently as Kang (&lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; \"Kanka\"), south of modern &lt;a href=\"Tashkent\"&gt;Tashkent&lt;/a&gt; and founded in the 1st century CE. Kang had a square layout, encircled by a wall with inner passages.\nThe settlements were surrounded by &lt;a href=\"kurgan\"&gt;kurgan&lt;/a&gt; burials of a catacomb type with long &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20architecture%23D\"&gt;dromoses&lt;/a&gt;, crypts, and burial vaults, with horse bone trappings and rites typical of nomads.\nThe people predominantly practiced cattle husbandry and nonirrigated agriculture (grain cultures of millet, barley, wheat, and rice, cotton, melons, and fruits).\nMaterials typical of the culture are typical hand-formed pottery: \"khums\" (large bowls for water and produce), pots, pitchers, and cups adorned with ram's head on the handles. In the 1st century CE ceramics made on a &lt;a href=\"potter%27s%20wheel\"&gt;potter's wheel&lt;/a&gt; became more common. A &lt;a href=\"Sheep\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt;'s head motif at first common was replaced by a &lt;a href=\"bull\"&gt;bull&lt;/a&gt;'s head during the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. At that period weapons started appearing in the kurgans.\nKaunchi-type sites apparently spread from the &lt;a href=\"Otrar\"&gt;Otrar&lt;/a&gt; region along Syr Darya to the south of Tashkent. The Kaunchi culture significantly impacted the archeological cultures in the vast territories of the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Asia\"&gt;Middle Asia&lt;/a&gt;.\nInscriptions.\nSome important inscriptions were discovered recently that provide information about Kangju and its contacts with China.\nGenetics.\nA genetic study published in \"&lt;a href=\"Nature%20%28journal%29\"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;\" in May 2018 examined the remains of 6 Kangju buried between ca. 200 CE and 300 CE. The 2 samples of &lt;a href=\"Y-DNA\"&gt;Y-DNA&lt;/a&gt; extracted belonged to the paternal haplogroups &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20R1a%23R1a1a1b2%20%28R-Z93%29%20%28Asia%29\"&gt;R1a1a1b2a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20R1a%23R1a1a1b2%20%28R-Z93%29%20%28Asia%29\"&gt;R1a1a1b2a2b&lt;/a&gt;, while the 6 samples &lt;a href=\"mtDNA\"&gt;mtDNA&lt;/a&gt; extracted belonged to the maternal haplogroups &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20H%20%28mtDNA%29\"&gt;H6a1a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20C%20%28mtDNA%29\"&gt;C4a1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20U%20%28mtDNA%29%23Haplogroup%20U2\"&gt;U2e2a1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20HV%20%28mtDNA%29\"&gt;HV13b&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20U%20%28mtDNA%29%23Haplogroup%20U2\"&gt;U2e1h&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20A%20%28mtDNA%29\"&gt;A8a1&lt;/a&gt;. The authors of the study found that the Kangju and &lt;a href=\"Wusun\"&gt;Wusun&lt;/a&gt; had less &lt;a href=\"East%20Asian%20people\"&gt;East Asian&lt;/a&gt; admixture than the &lt;a href=\"Xiongnu\"&gt;Xiongnu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saka\"&gt;Saka&lt;/a&gt;s. Both the Kangju and Wusun were suggested to be descended from &lt;a href=\"Western%20Steppe%20Herders\"&gt;Western Steppe Herders&lt;/a&gt; (WSHs) of the Late Bronze Age who admixed with Siberian hunter-gatherers and peoples related to the &lt;a href=\"Bactria%E2%80%93Margiana%20Archaeological%20Complex\"&gt;Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex&lt;/a&gt;."
