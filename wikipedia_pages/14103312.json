    "text": "Carlos Eug\u00e9nio Corr\u00eaa da Silva, 1st Viscount and 1st &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Pa%C3%A7o%20de%20Arcos\"&gt;Count of Pa\u00e7o de Arcos&lt;/a&gt; (December 17, 1834 \u2013 November 5, 1905), was a &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; statesman.\nOrigins.\nThe Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos was born in the parish (\"&lt;a href=\"freguesia\"&gt;freguesia&lt;/a&gt;\") of the same name near &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; on the December 17, 1834. His father was a high ranking Crown servant (\"Pagador-Geral da Marinha\") that had allied himself with the liberal cause during the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Portuguese Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. His mother came from a wealthy landed family, the Corr\u00eaa de Almeida (&lt;a href=\"List_of_Countships_in_Portugal%23S\"&gt;Counts of S\u00e3o Janu\u00e1rio&lt;/a&gt;), that owned much of the land in the parish, with the notable exception of the Palace of the Arches (\"Pal\u00e1cio dos Arcos\") that had belonged to the &lt;a href=\"List_of_Countships_in_Portugal%23A\"&gt;Counts of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas&lt;/a&gt; for centuries.\nHe married on September 6, 1876 Em\u00edlia Ang\u00e9lica de Castro Monteiro (b. &lt;a href=\"Maia%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Maia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pedrou%C3%A7os\"&gt;Pedrou\u00e7os&lt;/a&gt;, October 3, 1848), maternal granddaughter of the &lt;a href=\"Lists_of_Countships_in_Portugal%23C\"&gt;Viscounts and Counts of Castro&lt;/a&gt;, and had issue. The titles of &lt;a href=\"Viscount\"&gt;Viscount&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pa%C3%A7o%20de%20Arcos\"&gt;Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos&lt;/a&gt; are held by the Correia da Silva family of &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaval career.\nHe excelled in school from an early age, having attended the School for Nobles (\"Real Col\u00e9gio dos Nobres\") and later enrolled in the Portuguese Naval Academy (\"&lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Naval%20School\"&gt;Escola Naval&lt;/a&gt;\") at the age of 14, for which royal permission was needed. At 18 the young &lt;a href=\"Ensign%20%28rank%29\"&gt;ensign&lt;/a&gt; had his first experience under fire having been given his first command of the &lt;a href=\"schooner\"&gt;schooner&lt;/a&gt; \"Venus\" whose mission was to apprehend the pirate Apack in the South China Sea. As a young &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; he was appointed &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Tower%20and%20Sword\"&gt;Military Order of the Tower and Sword&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ordem Militar da Torre e Espada\"), Portugal's highest decoration awarded for bravery in combat, for his heroics in pursuing and capturing the Spanish &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20slave%20trade\"&gt;slave ship&lt;/a&gt; \"Virgen del Refugio\" off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Guinea\"&gt;Portuguese Guinea&lt;/a&gt; in 1864. As a 27-year-old second lieutenant in 1862 the Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos also commanded the &lt;a href=\"schooner\"&gt;schooner&lt;/a&gt; \"Napier\" in pursuit of the US confederate pirate ship \"&lt;a href=\"CSS%20Alabama\"&gt;CSS Alabama&lt;/a&gt;\" in the mid Atlantic near the &lt;a href=\"Azores\"&gt;Azores&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe held many other commands, including the &lt;a href=\"brig\"&gt;brig&lt;/a&gt; \"Pedro Nunes\" as &lt;a href=\"first%20lieutenant\"&gt;first lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, which had been &lt;a href=\"Luis%20I\"&gt;King Luis I&lt;/a&gt;'s personal command before accession to the throne. His appointment was a personal decision of the King with whom he shared a passion for the sea and later a close friendship. Usually such a prestigious command was held by someone of much higher rank and his appointment was proof of the King's confidence in his abilities as a leader of men. He later commanded the &lt;a href=\"gunboat\"&gt;gunboat&lt;/a&gt; \"Zarco\" and the &lt;a href=\"corvettes\"&gt;corvettes&lt;/a&gt; \"Sagres\" and \"Estef\u00e2nia\", eventually rising to the top of his career as a naval officer in the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Navy\"&gt;Portuguese Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;, having achieved the rank of &lt;a href=\"Vice-Admiral\"&gt;Vice-Admiral&lt;/a&gt; (1895) and Major-General of the Armada (the highest rank of the Portuguese Royal Navy) before his retirement one year prior to his death in 1905.\nColonial and diplomatic career.\nThe 1stCount of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos had a notable colonial career throughout the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Empire\"&gt;Portuguese Empire&lt;/a&gt;, having reached its pinnacle as &lt;a href=\"Governor-General\"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20India\"&gt;Portuguese India&lt;/a&gt; (1881). He was also &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Macao\"&gt;Governor of Macao&lt;/a&gt; (1876\u20131879) and &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20heads%20of%20Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; (1880), as well as Portugal's first Ambassador to &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; (1891\u20131893) after the former colony &lt;a href=\"Brazilian_independence%23Brazilian_independence\"&gt;abolished the monarchy&lt;/a&gt; and sent Emperor &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Pedro II of Brazil&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Bragan%C3%A7a\"&gt;House of Bragan\u00e7a&lt;/a&gt; into exile. This prestigious diplomatic post was fraught with difficulties as he represented to the new Brazilian republican government the reigning Portuguese &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Bragan%C3%A7a\"&gt;House of Bragan\u00e7a&lt;/a&gt; which their ousted Emperor belonged to. In his diplomatic career he was also &lt;a href=\"Minister%20Plenipotentiary\"&gt;Minister Plenipotentiary&lt;/a&gt; to China, Japan and the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Siam\"&gt;Siam&lt;/a&gt;.\nCivil Governor of Lisbon.\nAs Governor of &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; in 1890 the Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos was responsible for ordering the bloody police crackdown after days of rioting followed the issuing of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Ultimatum\"&gt;British Ultimatum&lt;/a&gt; regarding &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20colonies\"&gt;Portuguese colonies&lt;/a&gt; in Africa. The &lt;a href=\"Republicanism%23Anti-monarchial_republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; underground in Portugal seized the opportunity of the humiliating British Ultimatum to blame the monarchy and the King for Portugal's loss of prestige. After news of the Ultimatum and Portugal's concessions in Africa (present day &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;) reached the Portuguese people, Lisbon was thrown into a state of turmoil following massive rioting which threatened to bring down the regime. This was perhaps the first sign of what was to come when 18 years later &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;King Carlos I&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Royal%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Prince Royal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Filipe%2C%20Duke%20of%20Braganza\"&gt;Luis F\u00edlipe&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"regicide\"&gt;assassinated&lt;/a&gt; by members of the &lt;a href=\"Jacobin%20%28politics%29\"&gt;jacobin&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Carbon%C3%A1ria\"&gt;Carbon\u00e1ria&lt;/a&gt;\" in downtown Lisbon on February 1, 1908, eventually leading to the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20First%20Republic\"&gt;republican revolution of October 5, 1910&lt;/a&gt;. The Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos, in his role as Governor and commander of the police in Lisbon, fulfilled his duty without hesitation, ordering the police to use force, which led to his vilification by the republican press of the time.\nPromotion to \"Grande do Reino\".\nBecause of his service to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crown\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt;, the Viscount of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos was promoted in the Portuguese &lt;a href=\"nobility\"&gt;nobility&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Grandee\"&gt;Grandee&lt;/a&gt; of Portugal (\"&lt;a href=\"Royal%20and%20noble%20ranks\"&gt;Grande do Reino&lt;/a&gt;\") when &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;King Carlos I&lt;/a&gt; elevated his title to a &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt;ship (&lt;a href=\"Royal%20and%20noble%20ranks\"&gt;Earl in Britain&lt;/a&gt;).\nHis only son Henrique was, like his father, a distinguished naval officer and colonial ruler. Because of his beliefs and because of the republican revolution implanted by force of arms in 1910, he never claimed officially (\"encartar\") the title of Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos which nonetheless passed on to his eldest surviving son \u2013 also named Henrique.\nOther achievements and distinctions.\nThe Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos was also a member of &lt;a href=\"Privy%20council\"&gt;His Most Faithful Majesty's Council&lt;/a&gt; (\"Conselho de Sua Majestade Fidel\u00edssima\"), the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies\"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; (\"C\u00e2mara dos Deputados\") and a &lt;a href=\"Peer%20of%20the%20realm\"&gt;Peer of the Realm&lt;/a&gt; (\"Par do Reino\") as well as &lt;a href=\"Aide-de-Camp\"&gt;Aide-de-Camp&lt;/a&gt; to the King (\"Ajudante de Campo d'el rei\").\nOther distinctions held:"
