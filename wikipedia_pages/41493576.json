    "text": "Hulsig Church () is a church located in the village of &lt;a href=\"Hulsig\"&gt;Hulsig&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"Skagen\"&gt;Skagen&lt;/a&gt; in the far north of &lt;a href=\"Jutland\"&gt;Jutland&lt;/a&gt;, Denmark.\nHistory and description.\nThe little church which stands alone in the sand dunes close to the main road was completed in 1894. Designed by &lt;a href=\"Vilhelm%20Ahlmann\"&gt;Vilhelm Ahlmann&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Neo-Romanesque\"&gt;Neo-Romanesque&lt;/a&gt; style, the red-brick building consists of a triangular chancel and a nave. At the west end, there is a small bell tower with a spire. The painting on the &lt;a href=\"altarpiece\"&gt;altarpiece&lt;/a&gt; is a copy of &lt;a href=\"Joakim%20Skovgaard\"&gt;Joakim Skovgaard&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Hyrden finder det bortl\u00f8bne lam\" (The Shepherd finds the Lost Sheep). The organ from 1972 was designed by Peter Bruhn."
