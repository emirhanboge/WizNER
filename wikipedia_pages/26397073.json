    "text": "Jy\u0101, koti-jy\u0101 and utkrama-jy\u0101 are three &lt;a href=\"trigonometric%20functions\"&gt;trigonometric functions&lt;/a&gt; introduced by &lt;a href=\"Indian%20mathematics\"&gt;Indian mathematician&lt;/a&gt;s and astronomers. The earliest known Indian treatise containing references to these functions is &lt;a href=\"Surya%20Siddhanta\"&gt;Surya Siddhanta&lt;/a&gt;. These are functions of arcs of circles and not functions of angles. Jy\u0101 and kotijy\u0101 are closely related to the modern &lt;a href=\"trigonometric%20functions\"&gt;trigonometric functions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"sine\"&gt;sine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cosine\"&gt;cosine&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the origins of the modern terms of \"sine\" and \"cosine\" have been traced back to the &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; words jy\u0101 and kotijy\u0101.\nDefinition.\nLet 'arc AB' denote an &lt;a href=\"Arc%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;arc&lt;/a&gt; whose two extremities are A and B of a circle with center O. If a perpendicular BM be dropped from B to OA, then:\nIf the radius of the circle is \"R\" and the length of arc AB is \"s\", the angle subtended by arc AB at O measured in radians is \u03b8 = \"s\" / \"R\". The three Indian functions are related to modern trigonometric functions as follows:\nTerminology.\nAn arc of a circle is like a bow and so is called a \"dhanu\" or \"ch\u0101pa\" which in &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; means \"a bow\". \nThe straight line joining the two extremities of an arc of a circle is like the string of a bow and this line is a chord of the circle. This chord is called a \"jy\u0101\" which in &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; means \"a bow-string\", presumably translating &lt;a href=\"Hipparchus\"&gt;Hipparchus&lt;/a&gt;'s with the same meaning. \nThe word \"j\u012bv\u00e1\" is also used as a synonym for \"jy\u0101\" in geometrical literature.\nAt some point, Indian astronomers and mathematicians realised that computations would be more convenient if one used the halves of the chords instead of the full chords and associated the half-chords with the halves of the arcs. The half-chords were called \"ardha-jy\u0101\"s or \"jy\u0101-ardha\"s. These terms were again shortened to \"jy\u0101\" by omitting the qualifier \"ardha\" which meant \"half of\".\nThe Sanskrit word \"ko\u1e6di\" has the meaning of \"point, cusp\", and specifically \"the &lt;a href=\"Recurve%20bow\"&gt;curved end of a bow&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn trigonometry, it came to denote \"the complement of an arc to 90\u00b0\". Thus \n\"ko\u1e6di-jy\u0101\" is \"the \"jy\u0101\" of the complementary arc\". In Indian treatises, especially in commentaries, \"ko\u1e6di-jy\u0101\" is often abbreviated as \"kojy\u0101\". The term \"ko\u1e6di\" also denotes \"the side of a right angled triangle\". Thus \"ko\u1e6di-jy\u0101\" could also mean the other &lt;a href=\"cathetus\"&gt;cathetus&lt;/a&gt; of a right triangle, the first cathetus being the \"jy\u0101\".\n\"Utkrama\" means \"inverted\", thus \"utkrama-jy\u0101\" means \"inverted chord\". \nThe tabular values of \"utkrama-jy\u0101\" are derived from the tabular values of \"jy\u0101\" by subtracting the elements from the radius in the reversed order. This is really the arrow between the bow and the bow-string and hence it has also been called \"b\u0101\u1e47a\", \"i\u1e63u\" or \"\u015bara\" all meaning \"arrow\".\nAn arc of a circle which subtends an angle of 90\u00b0 at the center is called a \"vritta-p\u0101da\" (a quadrat of a circle). Each zodiacal sign defines an arc of 30\u00b0 and three consecutive zodiacal signs defines a \"vritta-p\u0101da\". The \"jy\u0101\" of a \"vritta-p\u0101da\" is the radius of the circle. The Indian astronomers coined the term \"tri-jy\u0101\" to denote the radius of the base circle, the term \"tri-jy\u0101\" being indicative of \"the \"jy\u0101\" of three signs\". The radius is also called \"vy\u0101s\u0101rdha\", \"vi\u1e63kambh\u0101rdha\", \"vistar\u0101rdha\", etc., all meaning \"semi-diameter\".\nAccording to one convention, the functions \"jy\u0101\" and \"koti-jy\u0101\" are respectively denoted by \"Rsin\" and \"Rcos\" treated as single words. Others denote \"jy\u0101\" and \"koti-jy\u0101\" respectively by \"Sin\" and \"Cos\" (the first letters being capital letters in contradistinction to the first letters being small letters in ordinary sine and cosine functions).\nFrom jy\u0101 to sine.\nThe origins of the modern term sine have been traced to the Sanskrit word \"jy\u0101\", \nor more specifically to its synonym \"j\u012bva\".\nThis term was &lt;a href=\"Indian%20influence%20on%20Islamic%20science\"&gt;adopted in medieval Islamic mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, transliterated in Arabic as \"j\u012bba\" (&lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3A%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8\"&gt;\u062c\u064a\u0628&lt;/a&gt;). Since Arabic is written without short vowels \u2013 and as a borrowing the long vowel is here denoted with \"y\u0101\u02be\" \u2013 this was interpreted as the homographic \"jayb\", which means \"bosom\". The text's 12th-century &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; translator used the Latin equivalent for \"bosom\", \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Asinus\"&gt;sinus&lt;/a&gt;\". When \"jy\u0101\" became \"sinus\", by analogy \"kojy\u0101\" became \"co-sinus\"."
