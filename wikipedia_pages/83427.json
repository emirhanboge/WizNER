    "text": "A father is the &lt;a href=\"male\"&gt;male&lt;/a&gt; parent of a &lt;a href=\"child\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations. An adoptive father is a male who has become the child's parent through the legal process of &lt;a href=\"adoption\"&gt;adoption&lt;/a&gt;. A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"infant\"&gt;infant&lt;/a&gt;, through &lt;a href=\"sexual%20intercourse\"&gt;sexual intercourse&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sperm%20donation\"&gt;sperm donation&lt;/a&gt;. A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support. A &lt;a href=\"putative%20father\"&gt;putative father&lt;/a&gt; is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established. A &lt;a href=\"stepfather\"&gt;stepfather&lt;/a&gt; is a male who is the husband of a child's mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.\nThe &lt;a href=\"adjective\"&gt;adjective&lt;/a&gt; \"paternal\" refers to a father and comparatively to \"maternal\" for a &lt;a href=\"mother\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"verb\"&gt;verb&lt;/a&gt; \"to father\" means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun \"fathering\". Biological fathers determine the sex of their child through a &lt;a href=\"sperm\"&gt;sperm&lt;/a&gt; cell which either contains an &lt;a href=\"X%20chromosome\"&gt;X chromosome&lt;/a&gt; (female), or &lt;a href=\"Y%20chromosome\"&gt;Y chromosome&lt;/a&gt; (male). Related &lt;a href=\"term%20of%20endearment\"&gt;terms of endearment&lt;/a&gt; are \"dad\" (\"dada\", \"daddy\"), \"baba, papa\", \"pappa\", papasita, (\"pa\", \"pap\") and \"pop\". A male role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a \"father-figure\".\nPaternal rights.\nThe &lt;a href=\"paternity%20%28law%29\"&gt;paternity&lt;/a&gt; rights of a father with regard to his children differ widely from country to country often reflecting the level of involvement and roles expected by that society.\n&lt;a href=\"Parental%20leave\"&gt;Parental leave&lt;/a&gt; is when a father takes time off to support his newly born or adopted baby. Paid paternity leave first began in &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; in 1976, and is paid in more than half of &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; countries. In the case of male same-sex couples the law often makes no provision for either one or both fathers to take paternity leave.\n&lt;a href=\"Fathers%27%20rights%20movement\"&gt;Fathers' rights movement&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Fathers%204%20Justice\"&gt;Fathers 4 Justice&lt;/a&gt; argue that family courts are biased against fathers.\n&lt;a href=\"Child%20support\"&gt;Child support&lt;/a&gt; is an ongoing periodic payment made by one parent to the other; it is normally paid by the parent who does not have custody.\nAn estimated 2% of British fathers experiences &lt;a href=\"paternity%20fraud\"&gt;paternity fraud&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"non-paternity%20event\"&gt;non-paternity event&lt;/a&gt;, bringing up a child they wrongly believe to be their biological &lt;a href=\"offspring\"&gt;offspring&lt;/a&gt;.\nRole of the father.\nIn almost all cultures fathers are regarded as secondary caregivers. This perception is slowly changing with more and more fathers becoming primary caregivers, while mothers go to work or in single parenting situations, male same-sex parenting couples.\nFatherhood in the Western World.\nIn the West, the image of the married father as the primary wage-earner is changing. The social context of fatherhood plays an important part in the well-being of men and all their children. In the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; 16% of single parents were men as of 2013.\nImportance of father or father-figure.\nInvolved fathers offer developmentally specific provisions to their children and are impacted themselves by doing so. Active father figures may play a role in reducing behavior and psychological problems in young adults. An increased amount of father\u2013child involvement may help increase a child's social stability, educational achievement, and their potential to have a solid marriage as an adult. Their children may also be more curious about the world around them and develop greater problem solving skills. Children who were raised with fathers perceive themselves to be more cognitively and physically competent than their peers without a father. Mothers raising children together with a father reported less severe disputes with their child.\nThe father-figure is not always a child's biological father and some children will have a biological father as well as a step- or nurturing father. When a child is conceived through sperm donation, the donor will be the \"biological father\" of the child.\nFatherhood as legitimate identity can be dependent on domestic factors and behaviors. For example, a study of the relationship between fathers, their sons, and home computers found that the construction of fatherhood and masculinity required that fathers display computer expertise.\nDetermination of parenthood.\n&lt;a href=\"Roman%20law\"&gt;Roman law&lt;/a&gt; defined fatherhood as \"Mater semper certa; pater est quem nuptiae demonstrant\" (\"The [identity of the] mother is always certain; the father is whom the marriage vows indicate\"). The recent emergence of accurate scientific testing, particularly &lt;a href=\"DNA%20testing\"&gt;DNA testing&lt;/a&gt;, has resulted in the &lt;a href=\"family%20law\"&gt;family law&lt;/a&gt; relating to fatherhood experiencing rapid changes.\nHistory of fatherhood.\nFatherhood in humans evolved in ancient times.\nIn medieval and most of modern European history, caring for children was predominantly the domain of mothers, whereas fathers in many societies provide for the family as a whole. Since the 1950s, social scientists and feminists have increasingly challenged gender roles in Western countries, including that of the male breadwinner. Policies are increasingly targeting fatherhood as a tool of changing gender relations.\nPatricide.\nIn early human history there have been notable instances of &lt;a href=\"patricide\"&gt;patricide&lt;/a&gt;. For example:\nIn more contemporary history there have also been instances of father\u2013offspring conflicts, such as:\nNon-human fatherhood.\nFor some animals, it is the fathers who take care of the young.\nMany species, though, display little or no paternal role in caring for offspring. The male leaves the female soon after mating and long before any offspring are born. It is the females who must do all the work of caring for the young.\nFinally, in some species neither the father nor the mother provides any care."
