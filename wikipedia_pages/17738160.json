It is not much more than the southern top of &lt;a href=\"Cruach%20Ardrain\"&gt;Cruach Ardrain&lt;/a&gt;, with a descent of only 120m before the ascent to its larger neighbour. It is located approximately 10\u00a0km to the north of &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Katrine\"&gt;Loch Katrine&lt;/a&gt; close to the site of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Roy%20MacGregor\"&gt;Robert Roy MacGregor&lt;/a&gt;'s house."
