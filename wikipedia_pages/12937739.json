    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt;, a king walk, also known as a king march, steel king (, literally \"wanderking\") or fighting king, refers to occasions where the &lt;a href=\"king%20%28chess%29\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; travels up the &lt;a href=\"chessboard\"&gt;board&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"middle%20game\"&gt;middle game&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chess%20opening\"&gt;opening&lt;/a&gt;, often involved in a against the opposing king. This is a highly unusual occurrence, since the safety of the king is considered paramount, and players are recommended to keep the king out of harm's way, at least until the &lt;a href=\"Chess%20endgame\"&gt;endgame&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Steinitz\"&gt;Wilhelm Steinitz&lt;/a&gt;, often known as the father of modern chess, was renowned for his &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20%28saying%29\"&gt;maxim&lt;/a&gt; that \"the king is a fighting piece\". Dutch chess &lt;a href=\"historian\"&gt;historian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"author\"&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Krabb%C3%A9\"&gt;Tim Krabb\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; has documented over one hundred such games.\nBecause of the rarity of such &lt;a href=\"chess%20tactics\"&gt;tactics&lt;/a&gt;, those which reap rewards for the attacking player often have bestowed upon them. Perhaps the most famous in recent history, where &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Short\"&gt;Nigel Short&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Timman\"&gt;Jan Timman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tilburg\"&gt;Tilburg&lt;/a&gt; in 1991, was voted as one of the hundred greatest chess games in a list compiled by &lt;a href=\"FIDE%20Master\"&gt;FM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Graham%20Burgess\"&gt;Graham Burgess&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grandmaster%20%28chess%29\"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"John%20Nunn\"&gt;John Nunn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Emms%20%28chess%20player%29\"&gt;John Emms&lt;/a&gt;.\nA can also refer to occasions where the king travels across the board (from to , or vice versa) to reach a safer position."
