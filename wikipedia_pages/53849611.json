    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Nadal\"&gt;Rafael Nadal&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Stan%20Wawrinka\"&gt;Stan Wawrinka&lt;/a&gt; in the final, 6\u20132, 6\u20133, 6\u20131 to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2017 French Open. It was his record-extending tenth &lt;a href=\"French%20Open\"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt; title and 15th &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Slam%20%28tennis%29%23Tournaments\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; title overall. Nadal became the only man ever to win 10 singles titles at the same major. He won the title &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Grand%20Slam%E2%80%93related%20tennis%20records%23Won%20a%20title%20without%20losing%20a%20set\"&gt;without losing a set&lt;/a&gt; for a record-equaling third time (tying &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rn%20Borg\"&gt;Bj\u00f6rn Borg&lt;/a&gt;). He lost only 35 games during the tournament, his personal best, and the second-best in the tournament's history after Borg in &lt;a href=\"1978%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;. Nadal also became the third man after &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosewall\"&gt;Ken Rosewall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Sampras\"&gt;Pete Sampras&lt;/a&gt; to win a major title in his teens, twenties, and thirties.\n&lt;a href=\"Novak%20Djokovic\"&gt;Novak Djokovic&lt;/a&gt; was the defending champion, but lost to &lt;a href=\"Dominic%20Thiem\"&gt;Dominic Thiem&lt;/a&gt; in the quarterfinals. Djokovic was attempting to become the first man in the &lt;a href=\"Open%20Era\"&gt;Open Era&lt;/a&gt; to achieve a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Slam%20%28tennis%29%23Multiple%20Career%20Grand%20Slams\"&gt;double career Grand Slam&lt;/a&gt; (he would later achieve this feat in &lt;a href=\"2021%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;). This was the first time since &lt;a href=\"2010%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; that he did not reach at least the semifinals at the French Open, and the first time since &lt;a href=\"2009%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; that he lost a French Open match in straight sets.\nThe hard-fought semifinal between Wawrinka and &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Murray\"&gt;Andy Murray&lt;/a&gt; marked the end for both players at the top of the sport, as both suffered injuries that took them out of the game for months from which they did not reclaim their prior preeminence.\nThis was the first major for future &lt;a href=\"2019%20ATP%20Finals%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;ATP Finals&lt;/a&gt; champion and French Open finalist &lt;a href=\"Stefanos%20Tsitsipas\"&gt;Stefanos Tsitsipas&lt;/a&gt;, who lost to &lt;a href=\"Ivo%20Karlovi%C4%87\"&gt;Ivo Karlovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; in the first round."
