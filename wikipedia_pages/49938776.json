    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Fleetwood%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Fleetwood Town Football Club&lt;/a&gt; is an English professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club, based in the town of &lt;a href=\"Fleetwood\"&gt;Fleetwood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;. The club participates in &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20One\"&gt;League One&lt;/a&gt;, the third tier of English football.\nHistory.\nThe current club was officially established in 1997 but, in two previous incarnations, the club's history dates back to 1908. The original club, Fleetwood F.C., were champions of the &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20Combination\"&gt;Lancashire Combination&lt;/a&gt; in 1923\u201324. After almost sixty years as a Lancashire Combination club, they were made founder members of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Northern Premier League&lt;/a&gt; in 1968. After winning the Northern Premier League Cup in 1971, the club languished in the lower half of the table, finishing bottom for two successive seasons and folded in 1976 because of financial difficulties.\nThe club was re-established in 1977 as Fleetwood Town F.C.. Initially placed in Division One of the &lt;a href=\"Cheshire%20County%20League\"&gt;Cheshire League&lt;/a&gt;, they were moved in 1982 to the &lt;a href=\"North%20West%20Counties%20Football%20League\"&gt;North West Counties League&lt;/a&gt; Division Two in its inaugural year, and promoted to Division One in 1984. They reached the final of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Vase\"&gt;FA Vase&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, losing 3\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Halesowen%20Town\"&gt;Halesowen Town&lt;/a&gt; in front of a 16,000 crowd at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt;. The club was placed in Division One (second tier) of the Northern Premier League when the league established a second tier in 1987, becoming the inaugural Division One Champions in 1988. However, by 1996, this second club had also folded.\nRe-formed in 1997 as Fleetwood Wanderers, the club was placed back in Division One of the North West Counties Football League (now the tenth tier of the English League system) and a sponsorship deal saw the club's name immediately changed to Fleetwood Freeport F.C.. The club was promoted to the Premier Division of the North West Counties League in 1999 and renamed Fleetwood Town F.C. in 2002. Successive promotions as North West Counties League champions in 2005 and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;Northern Premier League First Division&lt;/a&gt; runners-up in 2006 saw the club reach the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;Northern Premier League Premier Division&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2007\u201308&lt;/a&gt; season Fleetwood won the Northern Premier League, gaining promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Conference%20North\"&gt;Conference North&lt;/a&gt;.\nFleetwood contested the play-offs in the second season in the Conference North, and after beating &lt;a href=\"Droylsden%20F.C.\"&gt;Droylsden&lt;/a&gt; on penalties in the semi-final Fleetwood won promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Conference\"&gt;Football Conference&lt;/a&gt; by beating &lt;a href=\"Alfreton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Alfreton Town&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 in the final. For the next season the club made all of its players full-time professionals. The club spent most of the season in or near the play-off positions, eventually qualifying by finishing in fifth place. In the play-off semi-finals, against &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Wimbledon\"&gt;AFC Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt;, a new attendance record of 4,112 was set in the home leg, but Fleetwood lost both games with an 8\u20131 aggregate scoreline. Fleetwood's 2011\u201312 season was very successful. In the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; they reached the Third Round for the first time. After beating &lt;a href=\"Mansfield%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Mansfield Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wycombe%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wycombe Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Yeovil Town&lt;/a&gt;, they were drawn at home to local rivals &lt;a href=\"Blackpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt;, but lost 5\u20131 to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Championship\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt; club, with &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Vardy\"&gt;Jamie Vardy&lt;/a&gt; scoring Fleetwood's only goal. In the league Fleetwood went on a 29-game unbeaten run and were declared champions with two games remaining, giving them promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Fleetwood%20Town%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2013\u201314&lt;/a&gt; season was another successful one. Having been in and around the automatic promotion places all season and getting to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Trophy\"&gt;League Trophy&lt;/a&gt; area final, the club narrowly missed out on automatic promotion finishing in 4th place. After beating &lt;a href=\"York%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;York City&lt;/a&gt; in the play-off semi-final, Fleetwood beat &lt;a href=\"Burton%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Burton Albion&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 from an &lt;a href=\"Antoni%20Sarcevic\"&gt;Antoni Sarcevic&lt;/a&gt; free-kick in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Football%20League%20Two%20play-off%20Final\"&gt;play-off final&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt; on 26 May to win promotion to &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20One\"&gt;League One&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.\nPlaying at the club's highest level the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Fleetwood%20Town%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2014\u201315&lt;/a&gt; season was the club's most successful yet. After three games the club was top of the league for two games and apart from a couple of games remained in the top half of the league all season eventually finishing a very credible 10th place.\nKey.\nKey to league record\nKey to cup records"
