    "text": "Aulne is an &lt;a href=\"Unincorporated%20area\"&gt;unincorporated community&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Marion%20County%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Marion County, Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The Aulne name was suggested by officials of the railroad when it was built through Aulne during the 19th century. It is located southwest of &lt;a href=\"Marion%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Marion&lt;/a&gt; at the intersection of Pawnee Road and 140th Street next to the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Pacific%20Railroad\"&gt;Union Pacific Railroad&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nFor many millennia, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Plains\"&gt;Great Plains&lt;/a&gt; of North America was inhabited by &lt;a href=\"nomadic\"&gt;nomadic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt;. From the 16th century to 18th century, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20France\"&gt;Kingdom of France&lt;/a&gt; claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the &lt;a href=\"French%20and%20Indian%20War\"&gt;French and Indian War&lt;/a&gt;, France secretly ceded &lt;a href=\"New%20France\"&gt;New France&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, per the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Fontainebleau%20%281762%29\"&gt;Treaty of Fontainebleau&lt;/a&gt;.\n19th century.\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Kansas\"&gt;modern day Kansas&lt;/a&gt; was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20Purchase\"&gt;Louisiana Purchase&lt;/a&gt; for 2.83 &lt;a href=\"Penny%20%28United%20States%20coin%29\"&gt;cents&lt;/a&gt; per &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1854, the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Territory\"&gt;Kansas Territory&lt;/a&gt; was organized, then in 1861 &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; became the 34th &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt;. In 1855, &lt;a href=\"Marion%20County%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Marion County&lt;/a&gt; was established within the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Territory\"&gt;Kansas Territory&lt;/a&gt;, which included the land for modern day Aulne.\nIn 1872, a railroad contractor, named Col. W. Sherburn, decided the location would be good location for a town and named it after himself, Sherburn, but it was too early and never used.\nIn 1887, the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%2C%20Kansas%20and%20Nebraska%20Railway\"&gt;Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway&lt;/a&gt; built a branch line north\u2013south from &lt;a href=\"Herington%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Herington&lt;/a&gt; through Aulne to &lt;a href=\"Caldwell%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;. It foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by &lt;a href=\"Chicago%2C%20Rock%20Island%20and%20Pacific%20Railway\"&gt;Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway&lt;/a&gt;, which shut down in 1980, and reorganized as &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%2C%20Kansas%20and%20Texas%20Railroad\"&gt;Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad&lt;/a&gt; which merged in 1988 with &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20Pacific%20Railroad\"&gt;Missouri Pacific Railroad&lt;/a&gt;, and finally merged in 1997 with &lt;a href=\"Union%20Pacific%20Railroad\"&gt;Union Pacific Railroad&lt;/a&gt;. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the \"Rock Island\".\nA post office existed in Aulne from August 19, 1887, to February 28, 1954.\n20th century.\nAulne was one of the finalist communities considered for &lt;a href=\"Tabor%20College%20%28Kansas%29\"&gt;Tabor College&lt;/a&gt; before it was established in &lt;a href=\"Hillsboro%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Hillsboro&lt;/a&gt; in 1908.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, the local telephone company decreed that \"No German could be spoken over the telephones\", because of \n&lt;a href=\"anti-German%20sentiment\"&gt;anti-German sentiment&lt;/a&gt; towards German-Americans.\nGeography.\nAulne is located roughly halfway between &lt;a href=\"Marion%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Marion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peabody%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Peabody&lt;/a&gt; next to the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Pacific%20Railroad\"&gt;Union Pacific Railroad&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\nThe community is served by &lt;a href=\"Marion%E2%80%93Florence%20USD%20408\"&gt;Marion\u2013Florence USD 408&lt;/a&gt; public school district. All students attend schools in &lt;a href=\"Marion%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Marion&lt;/a&gt;. The high school is a member of T.E.E.N., a shared video teaching network between five area high schools.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\n&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2056%20%28Kansas%29\"&gt;U.S. Route 56&lt;/a&gt; is to the north, &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2050%20%28Kansas%29\"&gt;U.S. Route 50&lt;/a&gt; is to the south, and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2077%20%28Kansas%29\"&gt;U.S. Route 77&lt;/a&gt; is east of the community. The Oklahoma Kansas Texas (OKT) line of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Pacific%20Railroad\"&gt;Union Pacific Railroad&lt;/a&gt; runs through the community, but it no longer has a side-spur at Aulne.\nExternal links.\nHistorical\nMaps"
