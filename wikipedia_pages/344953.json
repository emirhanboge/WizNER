    "text": "Eliahu Inbal (born 16 February 1936, &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;) is an Israeli &lt;a href=\"conducting\"&gt;conductor&lt;/a&gt;.\nInbal studied &lt;a href=\"violin\"&gt;violin&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Israeli%20Academy%20of%20Music\"&gt;Israeli Academy of Music&lt;/a&gt; and took composition lessons with &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Ben-Haim\"&gt;Paul Ben-Haim&lt;/a&gt;.
