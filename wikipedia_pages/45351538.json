    "text": "Palladio is a composition for &lt;a href=\"string%20orchestra\"&gt;string orchestra&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Jenkins\"&gt;Karl Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, written in 1995, with the title referring to the Italian &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; architect &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Palladio\"&gt;Andrea Palladio&lt;/a&gt; (1508\u20131580). The work in three movements is in the form of a &lt;a href=\"concerto%20grosso\"&gt;concerto grosso&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Motif%20%28music%29\"&gt;Motif&lt;/a&gt;s of the first movement, Allegretto, were used for a TV commercial of &lt;a href=\"De%20Beers\"&gt;De Beers&lt;/a&gt;, \"A Diamond Is Forever\", from 1993. Then Jenkins completed a &lt;a href=\"Suite%20%28music%29\"&gt;suite&lt;/a&gt; of three movements in the form of a &lt;a href=\"concerto%20grosso\"&gt;concerto grosso&lt;/a&gt; for string orchestra, named \"Palladio\", in reverence of the Renaissance architect.\n\"Palladio\" was published in 1996 by &lt;a href=\"Boosey%20%26amp%3B%20Hawkes\"&gt;Boosey &amp; Hawkes&lt;/a&gt;. It takes about 16 minutes to perform. The composer comments: \n\"Harmonious proportions and mathematics\" play a role in &lt;a href=\"Music%20and%20mathematics\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; as in &lt;a href=\"Mathematics%20and%20architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;. The architect Palladio based his designs on antique Roman models and studied especially the measurements of &lt;a href=\"Vitruvius\"&gt;Vitruvius&lt;/a&gt;. Jenkins in turn based his music on Palladio's \"harmonious mathematical principles\".\nThe music, especially the first movement, has been arranged for different ensembles, including &lt;a href=\"wind%20quintet\"&gt;wind quintet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wind%20band\"&gt;wind band&lt;/a&gt;. Jenkins made a version for piano and used the motifs of movement I for an &lt;a href=\"aria\"&gt;aria&lt;/a&gt; \"Exultate jubilate\", related to his 70th birthday.\nScoring and structure.\nThe piece in three movements is scored for string orchestra.\nRecording.\n\"Palladio\" is featured on a 1996 CD \"&lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Music\"&gt;Diamond Music&lt;/a&gt;\", played by members of the &lt;a href=\"London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra\"&gt;London Philharmonic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, conducted by the composer. It is combined with other music by Jenkins including variations from \"&lt;a href=\"Adiemus%20%28albums%29\"&gt;Adiemus&lt;/a&gt;\" and his second string quartet. Movement I appears in other collections, such as \"Karl Jenkins &amp; Adiemus: The Essential Collection\".\nEscala version.\nThe English string quartet &lt;a href=\"Escala%20%28group%29\"&gt;Escala&lt;/a&gt; recorded a version of Palladio in 2009 which featured on their &lt;a href=\"Escala%20%28album%29\"&gt;self-titled&lt;/a&gt; debut album, following their appearance on the &lt;a href=\"Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent%20%28series%202%29\"&gt;second series&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent\"&gt;Britain's Got Talent&lt;/a&gt;\". It was released as a single and peaked at number 39 on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; in the week ending 6 June 2009. The single spent one week in the top 40."
