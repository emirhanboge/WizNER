    "text": "Dr. Ivo Tartaglia (; 5 February 1880 \u2013 3 April 1949) was \"a committed anti-fascist\",\na former \"&lt;a href=\"ban%20%28title%29\"&gt;ban&lt;/a&gt;\" (governor) of the province of &lt;a href=\"Littoral%20Banovina\"&gt;Littoral Banovina&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Croatian%20language\"&gt;Croatian&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Serbo-Croatian\"&gt;Serbo-Croat&lt;/a&gt;: \"Primorska banovina\"), and the 32nd mayor of &lt;a href=\"Split%20%28city%29\"&gt;Split&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; (in what is today known as &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;).\nBiography.\nTartaglia was born in Split in 1880. He grew up in a noble family with &lt;a href=\"Dalmatian%20Italian\"&gt;Dalmatian Italian&lt;/a&gt; roots.\nHe was known as a patron, art lover, &lt;a href=\"bibliophile\"&gt;bibliophile&lt;/a&gt;, and collector. On 29 May 1928, the Split Town Hall decided to form the &lt;a href=\"Gallery%20of%20Fine%20Arts%2C%20Split\"&gt;Gallery of Fine Arts&lt;/a&gt;, but due to a lack of funds, the Gallery did not open until 1 December 1931 (as the Gallery of Fine Arts of the Coastal Province). Tartaglia's bequest added more than 300 works to the Gallery's holdings.\nIn June 1948, Tartaglia was put on trial in Split, along with others, on charges of having expressed pro-Mussolini sentiments and otherwise undermining the government of the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. (Tartaglia had opposed Mussolini during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World\u00a0War\u00a0II&lt;/a&gt;.) He was sentenced to seven years at hard labor, plus the loss of his civic rights for two years after that, as well as having all of his property confiscated.\nTartaglia died in 1949 at the &lt;a href=\"Lepoglava%20prison\"&gt;Lepoglava prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nMayor of Split.\nHe was responsible for building the Li\u010dke railways in 1925, which connected peninsular Split to the mainland. At the time, Yugoslavia would not finance the construction of railways. Tartaglia enlisted entrepreneurs and savings banks to support the project. During his incumbency, the zoo opened, airports were expanded and modernized, and a meteorological station was built.\n\"Ban\" of Littoral Banovina.\nTartaglia was the \"ban\" of Littoral Banovina from 9 October 1929 to June 1932.\nThe \"ban\" started a series of projects in &lt;a href=\"Littoral%20Banovina\"&gt;Littoral Banovina&lt;/a&gt;, building hospitals in Biograd, draining wetlands, improvement of agriculture, etc.\nBetween 1929 and 1932, the \"ban\" of Littoral Banovina was based in Split."
