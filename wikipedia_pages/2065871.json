He was purchased by the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt; from the Phillies in July 1965 shortly after hitting &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Allen\"&gt;Richie Allen&lt;/a&gt; with a bat, but was traded to Braves for a &lt;a href=\"player%20to%20be%20named%20later\"&gt;player to be named later&lt;/a&gt; (Mickey Sinnerud) in September 1965. In an hour-long interview aired December 15, 2009, on the MLB Network's Studio 42 with Bob Costas, Allen asserted that he and Thomas are in fact good friends now.\nOn April 5, 1966, Thomas was released by the Braves. He signed with the Cubs on May 14, 1966, and after recording five plate appearances without a hit, he was released on June 4, 1966.\nIn a 16-season career, Thomas posted a .266 &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; with 286 &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s and 962 &lt;a href=\"run%20batted%20in\"&gt;RBI&lt;/a&gt;s in 1766 &lt;a href=\"games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;. He was larger than the average player of his time, and known for his opinionated nature. One of his nicknames as a player was \"The Big Donkey.\"\nFamily life.\nThomas and his wife, Dolores, were married for over 60 years and had eight children before he became a widower. He has 12 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren."
