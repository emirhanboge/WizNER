    "text": "The Bundesstra\u00dfe 186 is a German federal highway. Originally, this road ran from &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6then\"&gt;K\u00f6then&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bitterfeld\"&gt;Bitterfeld&lt;/a&gt;. During East German rule, the number 186 was reassigned to a loop running around the city of &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;. Due to &lt;a href=\"brown%20coal\"&gt;brown coal&lt;/a&gt; mining, two strips of road in the north (between &lt;a href=\"Schkeuditz\"&gt;Schkeuditz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taucha\"&gt;Taucha&lt;/a&gt;) and the south (between &lt;a href=\"Zwenkau\"&gt;Zwenkau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Markkleeberg\"&gt;Markkleeberg&lt;/a&gt;) had to be demolished, splitting up the road into two segments.\nIn 2010, the eastern segment was degraded, leaving only the western segment."
