    "text": "John III ( ; 7 June 1502 \u2013 11 June 1557), nicknamed The Pious (&lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20language\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;: \"o Piedoso\"), was the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Portuguese%20monarchs\"&gt;King of Portugal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20the%20Algarves\"&gt;Algarves&lt;/a&gt; from 1521 until his death in 1557. He was the son of &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;King Manuel I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maria%20of%20Aragon%20%281482%E2%80%931517%29\"&gt;Maria of Aragon&lt;/a&gt;, the third daughter of King &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;Ferdinand II of Aragon&lt;/a&gt; and Queen &lt;a href=\"Isabella%20I%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Isabella I of Castile&lt;/a&gt;. John succeeded his father in 1521 at the age of nineteen.\nDuring his rule Portuguese possessions were extended in Asia and in the New World through the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Portuguese colonization&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. John III's policy of reinforcing Portugal's bases in India (such as &lt;a href=\"Goa\"&gt;Goa&lt;/a&gt;) secured Portugal's monopoly over the &lt;a href=\"spice%20trade\"&gt;spice trade&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"cloves\"&gt;cloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nutmeg\"&gt;nutmeg&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Maluku%20Islands\"&gt;Maluku Islands&lt;/a&gt;. On the eve of his death in 1557, the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20empire\"&gt;Portuguese empire&lt;/a&gt; had a global dimension and spanned almost .\nDuring his reign, the Portuguese became the first Europeans to make contact with Japan (during the &lt;a href=\"Muromachi%20period\"&gt;Muromachi period&lt;/a&gt;). He abandoned the &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; territories in North Africa in favor of the trade with India and investments in Brazil. In Europe he improved relations with the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20region\"&gt;Baltic region&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rhineland\"&gt;Rhineland&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that this would bolster Portuguese trade.\nEarly life.\nJohn, the eldest son of King &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Manuel I&lt;/a&gt; born from his second wife &lt;a href=\"Maria%20of%20Aragon%2C%20Queen%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Maria of Aragon&lt;/a&gt;, was born in &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; on 7 June 1502. The event was marked by the presentation of &lt;a href=\"Gil%20Vicente\"&gt;Gil Vicente&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Visitation Play or the Monologue of the Cowherd\" (\"Auto da Visita\u00e7\u00e3o ou Mon\u00f3logo do Vaqueiro\") in the queen's chamber.\nThe young prince was sworn heir to the throne in 1503, the year his youngest sister, &lt;a href=\"Isabella%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Isabella of Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, Empress Consort of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; between 1527 and 1538, was born.\nJohn was educated by notable scholars of the time, including the &lt;a href=\"astrologer\"&gt;astrologer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A1s%20de%20Torres\"&gt;Tom\u00e1s de Torres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D.%20Diogo%20Ortiz%20de%20Villegas\"&gt;Diogo de Ortiz, Bishop of Viseu&lt;/a&gt;, and Lu\u00eds Teixeira Lobo, one of the first Portuguese &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20humanists\"&gt;Renaissance humanists&lt;/a&gt;, rector of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Siena\"&gt;University of Siena&lt;/a&gt; (1476) and Professor of Law at Ferrara (1502).\nJohn's &lt;a href=\"chronicler\"&gt;chronicler&lt;/a&gt; Ant\u00f3nio de Castilho said that, \"Dom Jo\u00e3o III faced problems easily, complementing his lack of culture with a practice formation that he always showed during his reign\" (\"Elogio d'el rei D. Jo\u00e3o de Portugal, terceiro, do nome\"). In 1514 he was given his own house, and a few years later began to help his father in administrative duties.\nAt the age of sixteen John was chosen to marry his first cousin, the 20-year-old &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Eleanor of Austria&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest daughter of &lt;a href=\"Philip%20the%20Handsome\"&gt;Philip the Handsome&lt;/a&gt; of Austria-Burgundy and Queen &lt;a href=\"Joanna%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Joanna of Castile&lt;/a&gt;, but instead she married his widowed father Manuel. John took deep offence at this: his chroniclers say he became melancholic and was never quite the same. Some historians also argue this was one of the main reasons that John later became fervently religious, giving him the name of \"the Pious\" (&lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20language\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;: \"o Piedoso\").\nInitial reign.\nOn 19 December 1521 John was crowned king in the Church of S\u00e3o Domingos in Lisbon, beginning a thirty-six-year reign characterized by extensive activity in internal and overseas politics, especially in relations with other major European states. John III continued the &lt;a href=\"Political%20absolutism\"&gt;absolutist&lt;/a&gt; politics of his predecessors. He called the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Cortes\"&gt;Portuguese Cortes&lt;/a&gt; only three times and at great intervals: 1525 in &lt;a href=\"Torres%20Novas\"&gt;Torres Novas&lt;/a&gt;, 1535 in &lt;a href=\"%C3%89vora\"&gt;\u00c9vora&lt;/a&gt; and 1544 in &lt;a href=\"Almeirim\"&gt;Almeirim&lt;/a&gt;. During the early part of his reign, he also tried to restructure administrative and judicial life in his realm.\nThe marriage of John's sister &lt;a href=\"Isabella%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Isabella of Portugal&lt;/a&gt; to Holy Roman Emperor &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt;, enabled the Portuguese king to forge a stronger alliance with Spain and the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. To strengthen his ties with &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; he married his maternal first cousin &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20of%20Austria%2C%20Queen%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Catherine of Austria&lt;/a&gt;, younger sister of Charles V and his erstwhile fianc\u00e9e Eleanor, in the town of &lt;a href=\"Crato%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Crato&lt;/a&gt;. John III had nine children from that marriage, but most of them died at young age. By the time of John's death, only his grandson &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Sebastian&lt;/a&gt; was alive to inherit the crown.\nPolicy.\nThe large and far-flung &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Empire\"&gt;Portuguese Empire&lt;/a&gt; was difficult and expensive to administer and was burdened with huge &lt;a href=\"external%20debt\"&gt;external debt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trade%20deficit\"&gt;trade deficit&lt;/a&gt;s. Portugal's &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n and &lt;a href=\"Far%20East\"&gt;Far East&lt;/a&gt;ern interests grew increasingly chaotic under the poor administration of ambitious governors. John III responded with new appointments that proved troubled and short-lived: in some cases, the new governors even had to fight their predecessors to take up their appointments. The resulting failures in administration brought on a gradual decline of the Portuguese trade monopoly. In consideration of the challenging military situation faced by Portuguese forces worldwide, on 7 August 1549 John III declared every male subject between 20 and 65 years old recruitable for military service.\nAmong John III's many colonial governors in Asia were &lt;a href=\"Vasco%20da%20Gama\"&gt;Vasco da Gama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Mascarenhas\"&gt;Pedro Mascarenhas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lopo%20Vaz%20de%20Sampaio\"&gt;Lopo Vaz de Sampaio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nuno%20da%20Cunha\"&gt;Nuno da Cunha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%AAv%C3%A3o%20da%20Gama%20%2816th%20century%29\"&gt;Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Martim%20Afonso%20de%20Sousa\"&gt;Martim Afonso de Sousa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jo%C3%A3o%20de%20Castro\"&gt;Jo\u00e3o de Castro&lt;/a&gt; and Henrique de Meneses.\nOverseas, the Empire was threatened by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; in both the Indian Ocean and North Africa, causing Portugal to increase spending on defense and fortifications. Meanwhile in the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;, where Portuguese ships already had to withstand constant attacks of &lt;a href=\"Privateer\"&gt;Privateer&lt;/a&gt;s, an initial settlement of French colonists in Brazil created yet another \"front\". The French made alliances with native South Americans against the Portuguese and military and political interventions were used. Eventually they were forced out, but not until 1565.\nIn the first years of John III's reign, explorations in the &lt;a href=\"Far%20East\"&gt;Far East&lt;/a&gt; continued, and the Portuguese reached China and Japan; however these accomplishments were offset by pressure from a strengthening &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Suleiman%20the%20Magnificent\"&gt;Suleiman the Magnificent&lt;/a&gt;, and especially in India, where attacks became more frequent. The expense of defending Indian interests was huge. To pay for it, John III abandoned a number of strongholds in North Africa: &lt;a href=\"Safi%2C%20Morocco\"&gt;Safim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azemmour\"&gt;Azamor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alc%C3%A1cer%20Ceguer\"&gt;Alc\u00e1cer Ceguer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asilah\"&gt;Arzila&lt;/a&gt;.\nJohn III achieved an important political victory in securing the control of the &lt;a href=\"Maluku%20Islands\"&gt;Maluku Islands&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Spice Islands\" claimed by Spain since the &lt;a href=\"Magellan-Elcano%20circumnavigation\"&gt;Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation&lt;/a&gt;. After almost a decade of skirmishes in Southeast Asia, he signed the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Zaragoza\"&gt;Treaty of Zaragoza&lt;/a&gt; with Emperor Charles V on 22 April 1529. It defined the areas of Spanish and Portuguese influence in Asia and established the anti-meridian to the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Tordesillas\"&gt;Treaty of Tordesillas&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational relations.\nThe reign of John III was marked by active diplomacy. With Spain, he made alliances through marriage that ensured peace in the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; for a number of years. He himself married &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20of%20Austria%2C%20Queen%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Catherine of Austria&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Philip%20I%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Philip I of Castile&lt;/a&gt;. His sister &lt;a href=\"Isabella%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Isabella of Portugal&lt;/a&gt; married &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt;, the king of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor. His daughter &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Manuela%2C%20Princess%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Maria Manuela&lt;/a&gt; married King &lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Philip II of Spain&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 and there were others. However, the intermarriage of these closely related royal families may have been one of the factors that contributed to the poor health of John's children and of future King &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Sebastian of Portugal&lt;/a&gt;.\nJohn III remained neutral during the war between France and Spain, but stood firm in fighting the attacks of French privateers.\nHe strengthened relations with the &lt;a href=\"Papal%20States\"&gt;Papal States&lt;/a&gt; by introducing the &lt;a href=\"Inquisition\"&gt;Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; in Portugal and the adhesion of the Portuguese clergy to the &lt;a href=\"Counter-Reformation\"&gt;Counter-Reformation&lt;/a&gt;. This relationship with the Catholic Church made it possible for John to name whomever he desired to important religious positions in Portugal: his brothers &lt;a href=\"Henry%2C%20King%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Henry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Afonso%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Afonso&lt;/a&gt; were made &lt;a href=\"cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29\"&gt;Cardinal&lt;/a&gt;s and his biological son, Duarte; was made &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Braga\"&gt;Braga&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommercial relations were intensified with England, the countries of the Baltic regions and &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; during John III's reign. Meanwhile, in the opposite side of the world, Portugal was the first European nation to make contact with Japan. In China &lt;a href=\"Macau\"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt; was offered to the Portuguese, and soon Portugal controlled major trade routes in the area. In South Asia, the Portuguese continued its hostile stance against their Muslim rivals and insurgent Indian leaders.\nCulture.\nJohn III's support for the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20humanism\"&gt;humanist cause&lt;/a&gt; was significant. In literature, his active support of &lt;a href=\"Gil%20Vicente\"&gt;Gil Vicente&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garcia%20de%20Resende\"&gt;Garcia de Resende&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A1%20de%20Miranda\"&gt;S\u00e1 de Miranda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bernardim%20Ribeiro\"&gt;Bernardim Ribeiro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fern%C3%A3o%20Mendes%20Pinto\"&gt;Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jo%C3%A3o%20de%20Barros\"&gt;Jo\u00e3o de Barros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lu%C3%ADs%20de%20Cam%C3%B5es\"&gt;Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es&lt;/a&gt; was notable. About sciences, John III supported the mathematician &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Nunes\"&gt;Pedro Nunes&lt;/a&gt; and the physician &lt;a href=\"Garcia%20de%20Orta\"&gt;Garcia de Orta&lt;/a&gt;. Through his links to Portuguese humanists such as Lu\u00eds Teixeira Lobo, &lt;a href=\"Erasmus\"&gt;Erasmus&lt;/a&gt; dedicated his \"Chrysostomi Lucubrationes\" to John III of Portugal in 1527.\nThe monarch awarded many scholarships to universities abroad, mainly in the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Paris\"&gt;University of Paris&lt;/a&gt;, where fifty Portuguese students were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Coll%C3%A8ge%20Sainte-Barbe\"&gt;Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe&lt;/a&gt; headed by &lt;a href=\"Diogo%20de%20Gouveia\"&gt;Diogo de Gouveia&lt;/a&gt;. He definitively transferred the Portuguese university from &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Coimbra\"&gt;Coimbra&lt;/a&gt; in 1537.\nIn 1542 John III created in Coimbra a College of Arts (&lt;a href=\"Liberal%20arts\"&gt;Liberal arts&lt;/a&gt;) for which he quickly recalled the many prominent Portuguese and European teachers headed by &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20de%20Gouveia\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 de Gouveia&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Guienne\"&gt;College of Guienne&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;. Those included &lt;a href=\"George%20Buchanan\"&gt;George Buchanan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diogo%20de%20Teive%20%28humanist%29\"&gt;Diogo de Teive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jer%C3%B3nimo%20Os%C3%B3rio\"&gt;Jer\u00f3nimo Os\u00f3rio&lt;/a&gt;, Nicolas de Grouchy, Guillaume Gu\u00e9rante and &lt;a href=\"%C3%89lie%20Vinet\"&gt;\u00c9lie Vinet&lt;/a&gt;, who were decisive for the dissemination of the contemporary research of &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Nunes\"&gt;Pedro Nunes&lt;/a&gt;. The king provided the university with excellent resources. However, the importance of the College was shadowed by rivalry between the orthodox views of the \"Parisians\" group headed by Diogo de Gouveia and the more secular views of the \"Bordeaux\" school headed by his nephew Andr\u00e9 de Gouveia, within the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Counter-Reformation\"&gt;Counter-Reformation&lt;/a&gt; and the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Society of Jesus&lt;/a&gt;. The Society of Jesus founded colleges and made education more widely available.\nAnother noteworthy aspect of John III's rule was the support he gave to &lt;a href=\"missionaries\"&gt;missionaries&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"New%20World\"&gt;New World&lt;/a&gt;, Asia and Africa. In 1540, after successive appeals to &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Paul%20III\"&gt;Pope Paul III&lt;/a&gt; asking for missionaries for the Portuguese &lt;a href=\"East%20Indies\"&gt;East Indies&lt;/a&gt; under the \"&lt;a href=\"Padroado\"&gt;Padroado&lt;/a&gt;\" agreement, John III appointed &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Xavier\"&gt;Francis Xavier&lt;/a&gt; to take charge as &lt;a href=\"Apostolic%20Nuncio\"&gt;Apostolic Nuncio&lt;/a&gt;. He had been enthusiastically endorsed by Diogo de Gouveia, his teacher at the Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe, and advised the king to draw the youngsters of the newly formed Society of Jesus. The Jesuits were particularly important for mediating Portuguese relations with native peoples.\nInquisition.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Inquisition\"&gt;Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; was introduced into Portugal in 1536. Just like in Spain, the Inquisition was placed under the authority of the king.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;, or General Inquisitor, was named by the Pope after being nominated by the king, and he always came from within the &lt;a href=\"royal%20family\"&gt;royal family&lt;/a&gt;. The Grand Inquisitor would later nominate other inquisitors. In Portugal the first Grand Inquisitor was Cardinal Henry, the king's brother (who would later himself become king).\nThere were Courts of the Inquisition in Lisbon, Coimbra, \u00c9vora and from 1560 onwards, in Goa. The &lt;a href=\"Goa%20Inquisition\"&gt;Goa Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; changed the demographics of Goa considerably. Goa was called the \"Lisbon of the Far East\" and trade reached a new level.\nThe Portuguese did not leave Goa undeveloped, but rather they introduced modern architecture and built strong roads and bridges that have stood the test of time even today.\nThe activities of the Inquisition extended from book censorship, repression and trial for &lt;a href=\"divination\"&gt;divination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"witchcraft\"&gt;witchcraft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bigamy\"&gt;bigamy&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the prosecution of sexual crimes, especially &lt;a href=\"sodomy\"&gt;sodomy&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally created to punish religious deviance, the Inquisition came to have influence in almost every aspect of Portuguese society: politics, culture and social habits.\nImperial management.\nLuso-African relations.\nIn John III's time, trade between the Portuguese and Africans was extremely intense in \"&lt;a href=\"Factory%20%28trading%20post%29\"&gt;feitorias&lt;/a&gt;\" such &lt;a href=\"Arguim\"&gt;Arguim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elmina%20Castle\"&gt;Mina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mombasa\"&gt;Mombasa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sofala\"&gt;Sofala&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;. Under John III, several expeditions started in coastal Africa and advanced to the interior of the continent. These expeditions were formed by groups of &lt;a href=\"navigator\"&gt;navigator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s, adventurers and &lt;a href=\"missionaries\"&gt;missionaries&lt;/a&gt;. Missions in Africa were established by the College of Arts of Coimbra. The objective was to increase the king's &lt;a href=\"dominion\"&gt;dominion&lt;/a&gt;, develop peaceful relations and to &lt;a href=\"Christianize\"&gt;Christianize&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20peoples\"&gt;indigenous peoples&lt;/a&gt;. Relations with local rulers were often complicated by trade in &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s, as shown by John's correspondence with them.\nJohn III refused to abandon all of the Portuguese North African strongholds, but he had to make choices based on the economic or strategic value of each possession. John III decided to leave &lt;a href=\"Safi%2C%20Morocco\"&gt;Safim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azamor\"&gt;Azamor&lt;/a&gt; in 1541, followed by &lt;a href=\"Asilah\"&gt;Arzila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alc%C3%A1cer%20Ceguer\"&gt;Alc\u00e1cer Ceguer&lt;/a&gt; in 1549. The fortresses of &lt;a href=\"Ceuta\"&gt;Ceuta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tangiers\"&gt;Tangiers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mazagan\"&gt;Mazagan&lt;/a&gt; were strengthened \"to face the new military techniques, imposed by the generalization of heavy artillery, combined with light fire weapons and blades\".\nJohn III's &lt;a href=\"court%20jester\"&gt;court jester&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Jo%C3%A3o%20de%20S%C3%A1%20Panasco\"&gt;Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1 Panasco&lt;/a&gt;, a black African, who was eventually admitted to the prestigious &lt;a href=\"Military%20Order%20of%20Saint%20James%20of%20the%20Sword\"&gt;Order of Saint James&lt;/a&gt; based on his service in the &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20of%20Tunis%20%281535%29\"&gt;Conquest of Tunis (1535)&lt;/a&gt;.\nLuso-Asian relations.\nBefore the reign of John III, the Portuguese had already reached &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Siam&lt;/a&gt; (1511), the &lt;a href=\"Maluku%20Islands\"&gt;Maluku Islands&lt;/a&gt; (1512), the Chinese littoral (1513), &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Canton&lt;/a&gt; (1517) and &lt;a href=\"Timor\"&gt;Timor&lt;/a&gt; (1515). During John's rule the Portuguese reached Japan, and at the end of John's reign &lt;a href=\"Macau\"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt; was offered to Portugal by China. From India, John III imported an amazing variety of spices, herbs, minerals, and fabrics; from Malacca, exotic woods and spice; from Bengala, fabrics and exotic foodstuffs; from Alexandria and Cairo, exotic woods, metals, minerals, fabrics, and boullion; and from China, musk, rhubarb, &amp; silk in exchange for gromwells, pearls, horses from Arabia and Persia, non-worked silk, silk embroidery threads, fruits of the date palm, raisins, salt, sulphur and many other goods.\nAs Muslims and other peoples constantly attacked Portuguese &lt;a href=\"Naval%20fleet\"&gt;fleet&lt;/a&gt;s in India, and because it was so far away from mainland Portugal, it was extremely difficult for John III to secure Portuguese dominion in this area. A &lt;a href=\"viceroy\"&gt;viceroy&lt;/a&gt; (or Governor-General with extensive powers) was nominated, but it was not enough to defend the Portuguese possessions in India. The Portuguese started by creating \"feitorias\" \u2013 commercial strongholds in &lt;a href=\"Kochi%2C%20India\"&gt;Cochin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kannur\"&gt;Cannanore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quilon\"&gt;Coul\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cranganore\"&gt;Cranganore&lt;/a&gt; and Tanor \u2013 with the initial objective of establishing just a commercial dominion in the region.\nThe hostility of many Indian kingdoms and alliances between &lt;a href=\"sultan\"&gt;sultan&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zamorins\"&gt;zamorins&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of expelling the Portuguese made it necessary for the Europeans to establish a &lt;a href=\"sovereignty\"&gt;sovereign&lt;/a&gt; state. Portugal thus militarily occupied some key cities on the Indian coast and Goa became the headquarters of the Portuguese Empire in the East as of 1512. Goa became a starting point for the introduction of European cultural and religious values in India, and churches, schools and hospitals were built. Goa remained an overseas possession of Portugal until India reclaimed it in 1961.\nThe Portuguese arrived in Japan in 1543. Japan had been known in Portugal since the time of &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Polo\"&gt;Marco Polo&lt;/a&gt;, who called it \"Cipango\". Whether Portuguese nationals were the first Europeans to arrive in Japan is debated. Some say the first Portuguese arrival was the writer &lt;a href=\"Fern%C3%A3o%20Mendes%20Pinto\"&gt;Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto&lt;/a&gt;, while others say it was the navigators Ant\u00f3nio Peixoto, Ant\u00f3nio da Mota and Francisco Zeimoto.\nPortuguese traders started negotiating with Japan as early as of 1550 and established a base there in &lt;a href=\"Nagasaki%2C%20Nagasaki\"&gt;Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt;. By then, trade with Japan was a Portuguese monopoly under the rule of a &lt;a href=\"Captain-major\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt;. Because the Portuguese established themselves in Macau, Chinese commercial relations and the silver trade with Japan were improved under John III's rule.\nAfter the voyage of &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Magellan\"&gt;Ferdinand Magellan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Crown of Castile&lt;/a&gt; claimed the recently discovered &lt;a href=\"Maluku%20Islands\"&gt;Maluku Islands&lt;/a&gt;. In 1524, a conference of experts (&lt;a href=\"cartographer\"&gt;cartographer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cosmographer\"&gt;cosmographer&lt;/a&gt;s, pilots, etc.) was held to solve the dispute caused by the difficulty of determining the &lt;a href=\"meridian%20%28geography%29\"&gt;meridian&lt;/a&gt; agreed to in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Tordesillas\"&gt;Treaty of Tordesillas&lt;/a&gt;. The Portuguese delegation sent by John III included names such as Ant\u00f3nio de Azevedo Coutinho, &lt;a href=\"Diogo%20Lopes%20de%20Sequeira\"&gt;Diogo Lopes de Sequeira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lopo%20Homem\"&gt;Lopo Homem&lt;/a&gt; and Sim\u00e3o Fernandes. The dispute was settled in 1529 by the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Zaragoza\"&gt;Treaty of Zaragoza&lt;/a&gt;, signed by John III and Charles I of Spain. The Portuguese paid 350.000 gold \"&lt;a href=\"ducat\"&gt;ducados&lt;/a&gt;\" to Spain and secured their presence in the islands, which not have been necessary, since Portugal was actually entitled to the islands according to the Treaty of Tordesillas.\nIn 1553, Leonel de Sousa obtained authorization for the Portuguese to establish themselves in &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Canton&lt;/a&gt; and Macau. Macau was later offered to John III as a reward for Portuguese assistance against &lt;a href=\"Piracy\"&gt;maritime piracy&lt;/a&gt; in the period between 1557 and 1564. &lt;a href=\"Malacca\"&gt;Malacca&lt;/a&gt;, which controlled the eponymous &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Strait of Malacca&lt;/a&gt;, was vital to Portuguese interests in the Far East. After an unsuccessful expedition in 1509, Malacca was finally &lt;a href=\"Capture%20of%20Malacca%20%281511%29\"&gt;captured by Afonso de Albuquerque&lt;/a&gt;, the Portuguese viceroy of India, on 24 August 1511. Malacca was later taken by the Dutch in 1641.\nIn order to follow its trade routes to the Far East, Portugal depended on the seasonal &lt;a href=\"monsoon\"&gt;monsoon&lt;/a&gt; winds in the Indian Ocean. In winter the prevailing northeasterly monsoon impeded travel to India; in summer the southwest monsoon made departure from India difficult. As a result, Portugal decided that it needed permanent bases in India in addition to its ports in Africa, to pass the time while the wind was changing. In addition to Goa, they established themselves in Ceylon (in what is now &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;) through the conquest of several Ceylonese kingdoms in the sixteenth century. &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Ceylon\"&gt;Portuguese Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; remained in Portuguese hands until 1658, when it was seized by the Dutch after an epic &lt;a href=\"siege\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt;.\nPortuguese America.\nDuring the reign of King John III the Portuguese Empire established itself in South America with the foundation of the twelve &lt;a href=\"Captaincy%20Colonies%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Captaincy Colonies of Brazil&lt;/a&gt; (from 1534 onwards). Each with its own &lt;a href=\"donatary\"&gt;donatary&lt;/a&gt; captain, the twelve colonies worked independently. In 1549, John III established the &lt;a href=\"Governorate%20General%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Governorate General of Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, and the twelve captaincy colonies became subordinate to it. The first Governor-General appointed by John III, &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A9%20de%20Sousa\"&gt;Tom\u00e9 de Sousa&lt;/a&gt;, founded the city of &lt;a href=\"Salvador%2C%20Bahia\"&gt;Salvador, Bahia&lt;/a&gt; (S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos) in 1549. For his role in the colonization of South America, John III has been referred to as The Colonizer (&lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20language\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;: \"o Colonizador\").\nImmediately following the discovery of Brazil in 1500, the Portuguese imported &lt;a href=\"brazilwood\"&gt;brazilwood&lt;/a&gt;, Indian slaves and exotic birds from there. Brazilian wood was a very appreciated product in Europe because it could be used to produce a type of red dye. During John III's rule, after the initial &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;colonization&lt;/a&gt;, Portuguese explorers intensified the search for brazilwood and began the cultivation of &lt;a href=\"sugarcane\"&gt;sugarcane&lt;/a&gt;, which was well suited to the climate of Brazil and especially around &lt;a href=\"Recife\"&gt;Recife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%ADa\"&gt;Bah\u00eda&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the final years of John's reign Portugal's colony of Brazil was just beginning its rapid development as a producer of sugar that compensated for the gradual decline of revenues from Asia, a development that would continue during the reign of his grandson and successor, &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Sebastian&lt;/a&gt; (1557\u20131578). Since Brazil lacked a large native population and the Indians were not good plantation workers, the Portuguese colonists began importing African slaves to work their plantations. The first slaves, from the region of &lt;a href=\"Guinea\"&gt;Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in Brazil in 1539. Most of them worked in the sugarcane fields or served as house servants.\nDeath and dynastic issue.\nFrom 1539, the heir to the throne was &lt;a href=\"Jo%C3%A3o%20Manuel%2C%20Prince%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Jo\u00e3o Manuel, Prince of Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, who married &lt;a href=\"Joanna%20of%20Austria%2C%20Princess%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Joanna of Austria, Princess of Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt;. The sole son of John III to survive childhood, Prince John, was sick and died at young age (of juvenile &lt;a href=\"diabetes\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;), eighteen days before his wife gave birth to &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Prince Sebastian&lt;/a&gt; on 20 January 1554. When John III died of &lt;a href=\"apoplexy\"&gt;apoplexy&lt;/a&gt; in 1557, his only heir was his three-year-old grandson, &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Sebastian&lt;/a&gt;.\nJohn III's body rests in the &lt;a href=\"Jer%C3%B3nimos%20Monastery%2C%20Lisbon\"&gt;Monastery of Jer\u00f3nimos&lt;/a&gt; in Lisbon.\nStyle.\nLike his predecessors John III used the style \"\"El-rei\" (the king) followed by \"Dom\"\" (abbreviated to &lt;a href=\"Don%20%28honorific%29\"&gt;D.&lt;/a&gt;), a mark of high esteem for a distinguished Christian &lt;a href=\"nobleman\"&gt;nobleman&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe official style was the same used by his father Manuel I: \"Dom Jo\u00e3o, by the grace of God, King of Portugal, of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20the%20Algarves\"&gt;Algarve&lt;/a&gt;s, of either side of the sea in Africa, Lord of &lt;a href=\"Guinea\"&gt;Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; of the &lt;a href=\"Right%20of%20conquest\"&gt;Conquest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Navigation\"&gt;Navigation&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; Commerce of &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Safavid%20dynasty\"&gt;Persia&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Dom Jo\u00e3o, por gra\u00e7a de Deus, Rei de Portugal, e dos Algarves, d'aqu\u00e9m e d'al\u00e9m mar em \u00c1frica, Senhor da Guin\u00e9, e da Conquista, Navega\u00e7\u00e3o, &amp; Com\u00e9rcio da Eti\u00f3pia, Ar\u00e1bia, P\u00e9rsia, &amp; \u00cdndia\"). This style would only change in the 19th century when Brazil became a Vice-Kingdom.\nIn popular culture.\nJohn III of Portugal figures in &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Saramago\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Saramago&lt;/a&gt;'s 2008 novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Elephant%27s%20Journey\"&gt;The Elephant's Journey&lt;/a&gt;\".\nJohn III (attributed as Jo\u00e3o III) is the leader of Portugal as part of the New Frontier Pass &lt;a href=\"Downloadable%20content\"&gt;DLC&lt;/a&gt; in the grand-strategy game &lt;a href=\"Civilization%20VI\"&gt;Civilization VI&lt;/a&gt;.\nJohn III features in &lt;a href=\"Laurent%20Binet\"&gt;Laurent Binet&lt;/a&gt;'s 2021 novel \"Civilizations\"."
