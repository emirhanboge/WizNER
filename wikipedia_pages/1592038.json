    "text": "Glen Oaks Community College is a &lt;a href=\"Public%20college\"&gt;public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"community%20college\"&gt;community college&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Centreville%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Centreville, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn 1965, &lt;a href=\"Nora%20Hagen\"&gt;Nora Hagen&lt;/a&gt; donated a considerable amount of land in &lt;a href=\"Sherman%20Township%2C%20St.%20Joseph%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Sherman Township&lt;/a&gt; to Glen Oaks. Soon afterward, Glen Oaks was approved by the state as a credible institution authorized to provide college courses to students. Hagen, who gives her name to many sites at Glen Oaks, was one of the last surviving members of her immediate family and decided that the newly conceived college should receive those 120 acres (486,000 m\u00b2). She did so, commemorating the event in the following statements:\n\"This farm of 120 acres [486,000 m\u00b2] with the farmhouse and other buildings has been in the &lt;a href=\"Henry%20B.%20Hagen\"&gt;Henry B. Hagen&lt;/a&gt; family name for 90 years.\n\"In the year 1965 it was given to the St. Joseph County community college district to be used as the central campus of Glen Oaks Community College for the education of the county's young people.\n\"It is the memory of my father and mother, my sister &lt;a href=\"Louise%20C.%20Fry\"&gt;Louise C. Fry&lt;/a&gt; and her husband &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20D.%20Fry\"&gt;Stephen D. Fry&lt;/a&gt;, who became co-owners with me of this homestead in 1930, that I fondly dedicate this plaque.\n\"May &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;'s blessing rest on all who pass this way.\"\n5 November 1965,&lt;br&gt;\nNora C. Hagen,&lt;br&gt;\nThe Last Survivor\nLeadership.\nDr. David Devier serves as the college's &lt;a href=\"president%20%28education%29\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt;.\nAthletics.\nGlen Oaks has eight different sports programs: women's cross country, softball, volleyball, and basketball; men's cross country, baseball, and basketball; and men's golf."
