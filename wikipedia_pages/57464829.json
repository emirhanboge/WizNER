    "text": "The Red Terror in Hungary () was a period of repressive violence and suppression in 1919 during the four-month period of the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Soviet%20Republic\"&gt;Hungarian Soviet Republic&lt;/a&gt;, primarily towards &lt;a href=\"anti-communists\"&gt;anti-communist&lt;/a&gt; forces, and others deemed \"&lt;a href=\"enemy%20of%20the%20people\"&gt;enemies of the state&lt;/a&gt;\". According to Robin Okey, The &lt;a href=\"communist%20party\"&gt;communist party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; policies had considerable popular support among the proletarian masses of large industrial centers - especially in Budapest - where the working class represented a higher ratio of the inhabitants. In the Hungarian countryside, according to John Lukacs, the authority of the government was often nonexistent, serving as a launch-point for anti-communist insurgency. The new government followed the Soviet method: the party established its revolutionary terror groups (such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Lenin%20Boys\"&gt;Lenin Boys&lt;/a&gt;\") to \"overcome the obstacles\" of the \"worker's revolution\". It received its name in reference to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Terror\"&gt;Red Terror&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Soviet Russia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn March 1919, the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Party of Communists in Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, in alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Social Democratic Party of Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, gained control of the government of Hungary after president &lt;a href=\"Mih%C3%A1ly%20K%C3%A1rolyi\"&gt;Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi&lt;/a&gt; stepped aside. Soon after, a coup by Party of Communists in Hungary, led by &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9la%20Kun\"&gt;B\u00e9la Kun&lt;/a&gt;, established the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Soviet%20Republic\"&gt;Hungarian Soviet Republic&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo months after gaining power, the government attempted to restore Hungary to its &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;pre-World War I boundaries&lt;/a&gt;, first by recapturing parts of present-day &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;, and then attempting to recapture Transylvania from Romania. These unsuccessful recapture attempts, as well as the inefficacy of the government during the war period, lowered the support for the Communist Party, and on June 24 the Social Democratic Party attempted a coup to take control of the government. This attempted coup failed, and in its wake a series of reprisal arrests and lootings occurred in retaliation against the Social Democrats.\n&lt;a href=\"Tibor%20Szamuely\"&gt;Tibor Szamuely&lt;/a&gt; wrote in the pages of the \"V\u00f6r\u00f6s \u00dajs\u00e1g\" (\"Red News\"): \"Everywhere &lt;a href=\"Counter-revolutionary\"&gt;counter-revolutionaries&lt;/a&gt; run about and swagger; beat them down! Beat their heads where you find them! If &lt;a href=\"Counter-revolutionary\"&gt;counter-revolutionaries&lt;/a&gt; were to gain the upper hand for even a single hour, there will be no mercy on any proletarian. Before they stifle the revolution, suffocate them in their own blood!\" With their support, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zsef%20Cserny\"&gt;J\u00f3zsef Cserny&lt;/a&gt; organized a group of some 200 individuals known as \"Lenin Boys\" (\"Lenin-fi\u00fak\"), whose intention was to uncover \"counter-revolutionary\" activities in the Hungarian countryside. Similar groups operated within Budapest. \nCheckpoints were established in Budapest, and civilians were regularly arrested and taken away to be tortured with burning cigars, &lt;a href=\"Water%20cure%20%28torture%29\"&gt;water cure&lt;/a&gt;, and nails. In April, Szamuely ordered hostages to be taken in &lt;a href=\"Mak%C3%B3\"&gt;Mak\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;. These included former Speaker of the House of Representatives &lt;a href=\"Lajos%20N%C3%A1vay\"&gt;Lajos N\u00e1vay&lt;/a&gt;, his nephew Iv\u00e1n N\u00e1vay, and the Mayor of Mak\u00f3. The hostages were taken by train to Budapest, but along the way, Navay, Iv\u00e1n, and the mayor were forced to dig their own graves along an embankment and shot before they had finished. Using an armored train to travel the country side, the communist would regularly take hostages from random at villages and execute them in advance of invading Romanian or Czech soldiers, or if they believed the village was anti-communist. In addition to mass executions and arrest for \"crimes against the revolution\", the communist also used the red terror as an excuse to appropriate grain from peasants.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Soviet%20Republic\"&gt;Hungarian Soviet Republic&lt;/a&gt; ended in the first week of August 1919, when Romanian forces pushed all the way into Budapest. Kun went into exile in Russia; Szamuely fled to Austria, but killed himself after being captured by Austrian authorities. J\u00f3zsef Cserny was arrested and tried in November 1919; the Hungarian Bar Association refused to defend him at trial, so a lawyer was appointed by the court. He was executed in December along with 13 other members of the Lenin Boys.\nAfter the downfall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the Red Terror was answered by a wave of counter-reprisals once the Party of Communists leadership fled. These attacks on leftists, remaining revolutionaries and Jews are known as the \"&lt;a href=\"White%20Terror%20%28Hungary%29\"&gt;White Terror&lt;/a&gt;\" \nThe revolutionary tribunals executed between 370 and 587 of those in custody; others have placed the number at 590. \nA monument to the victims of the Red Terror was erected in Budapest in November 2019. It is a reconstruction of a 1934 monument built during &lt;a href=\"Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy\"&gt;Mikl\u00f3s Horthy&lt;/a&gt; rule. "
