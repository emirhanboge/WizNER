    "text": "The 1925 Buffalo Bisons season was their sixth in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt;. The team failed to improve on their &lt;a href=\"1924%20Buffalo%20Bisons%20%28NFL%29%20season\"&gt;previous record against league opponents&lt;/a&gt; of 6\u20135, winning one game. They finished fifteenth in the league. \nThis was the first season since 1917 that star player &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Hughitt\"&gt;Tommy Hughitt&lt;/a&gt; did not take the field for Buffalo; he had retired at the end of the previous season."
