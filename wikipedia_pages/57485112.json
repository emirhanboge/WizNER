SK Sinha suggested the idea to build a Sabhyata Dwar (Civilisation Gate) near the residence of City &lt;a href=\"Superintendent%20of%20Police%20%28India%29\"&gt;Superintendent of Police&lt;/a&gt; on the banks of River Ganga to show how the river port of Pataliputra attracted people from across the world.\nConstruction.\nOn 8 February 2014, foundation stone of Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre was laid by the then Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar of which the Sabhyata Dwar was a part of. The plan of the building was drawn by a &lt;a href=\"Delhi\"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt; based firm. Construction of the monument was done by the building and construction department of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Bihar\"&gt;Bihar government&lt;/a&gt;. On 21 May 2018, Sabhyata Dwar was inaugurated by the Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. The cost of construction of the project is 5 crore (50 million).\nStructure and appearance.\nThe Sabhyata Dwar is built on an area of one acre within the campus of Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre, north of &lt;a href=\"Gandhi%20Maidan\"&gt;Gandhi Maidan&lt;/a&gt;. At high the structure is taller than Gateway of India () and &lt;a href=\"Golghar\"&gt;Golghar&lt;/a&gt; (). The Dwar faces Ganga on its northern side. It consists of two arches built with Mauryan architecture with a smaller arch on either side. The structure is constructed from red and white sandstones. Atop the arch monument is a small &lt;a href=\"stupa\"&gt;stupa&lt;/a&gt; upon which rests Ashoka's four-sided &lt;a href=\"Lion%20capital%20of%20Ashoka\"&gt;lion capital&lt;/a&gt; made from alloyed metal. The northern and southern faces of the arches contain inscriptions attributed to Megasthenes, Ashoka, Buddha and Mahavira."
