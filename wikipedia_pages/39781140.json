    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, and more specifically in &lt;a href=\"polyhedral%20combinatorics\"&gt;polyhedral combinatorics&lt;/a&gt;, a Goldberg polyhedron is a convex &lt;a href=\"polyhedron\"&gt;polyhedron&lt;/a&gt; made from hexagons and pentagons. They were first described in 1937 by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Goldberg%20%28mathematician%29\"&gt;Michael Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; (1902\u20131990). They are defined by three properties: each face is either a pentagon or hexagon, exactly three faces meet at each vertex, and they have &lt;a href=\"rotational%20icosahedral%20symmetry\"&gt;rotational icosahedral symmetry&lt;/a&gt;. They are not necessarily mirror-symmetric; e.g. \"GP\"(5,3) and \"GP\"(3,5) are &lt;a href=\"enantiomorph\"&gt;enantiomorph&lt;/a&gt;s of each other. A Goldberg polyhedron is a &lt;a href=\"dual%20polyhedron\"&gt;dual polyhedron&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"geodesic%20sphere\"&gt;geodesic sphere&lt;/a&gt;.\nA consequence of &lt;a href=\"Euler%27s%20polyhedron%20formula\"&gt;Euler's polyhedron formula&lt;/a&gt; is that a Goldberg polyhedron always has exactly twelve pentagonal faces. Icosahedral symmetry ensures that the pentagons are always &lt;a href=\"regular%20polygon\"&gt;regular&lt;/a&gt; and that there are always 12 of them. If the vertices are not constrained to a sphere, the polyhedron can be constructed with planar equilateral (but not in general equiangular) faces.\nSimple examples of Goldberg polyhedra include the &lt;a href=\"dodecahedron\"&gt;dodecahedron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"truncated%20icosahedron\"&gt;truncated icosahedron&lt;/a&gt;. Other forms can be described by taking a &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28chess%29\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; move from one pentagon to the next: first take \"m\" steps in one direction, then turn 60\u00b0 to the left and take \"n\" steps. Such a polyhedron is denoted \"GP\"(\"m\",\"n\"). A dodecahedron is \"GP\"(1,0) and a truncated icosahedron is \"GP\"(1,1).\nA similar technique can be applied to construct polyhedra with &lt;a href=\"tetrahedral%20symmetry\"&gt;tetrahedral symmetry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"octahedral%20symmetry\"&gt;octahedral symmetry&lt;/a&gt;. These polyhedra will have triangles or squares rather than pentagons. These variations are given Roman numeral subscripts denoting the number of sides on the non-hexagon faces: GPIII(\"n\",\"m\"), GPIV(\"n\",\"m\"), and GPV(\"n\",\"m\").\nElements.\nThe number of vertices, edges, and faces of \"GP\"(\"m\",\"n\") can be computed from \"m\" and \"n\", with \"T\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"m\"2\u00a0+\u00a0\"mn\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"n\"2\u00a0=\u00a0(\"m\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"n\")2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"mn\", depending on one of three symmetry systems: \nThe number of non-hexagonal faces can be determined using the Euler characteristic, as demonstrated &lt;a href=\"Euler%20characteristic%23Soccer_ball\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction.\nMost Goldberg polyhedra can be constructed using &lt;a href=\"Conway%20polyhedron%20notation\"&gt;Conway polyhedron notation&lt;/a&gt; starting with (T)etrahedron, (C)ube, and (D)odecahedron seeds. The &lt;a href=\"Chamfer%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;chamfer&lt;/a&gt; operator, \"c\", replaces all edges by hexagons, transforming \"GP\"(\"m\",\"n\") to \"GP\"(2\"m\",2\"n\"), with a \"T\" multiplier of\u00a04. The \"truncated kis\" operator, \"y\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"tk\", generates \"GP\"(3,0), transforming \"GP\"(\"m\",\"n\") to \"GP\"(3\"m\",3\"n\"), with a \"T\" multiplier of\u00a09.\nFor class 2 forms, the \"dual kis\" operator, \"z\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"dk\", transforms \"GP\"(\"a\",0) into \"GP\"(\"a\",\"a\"), with a \"T\" multiplier of 3. For class 3 forms, the \"whirl\" operator, \"w\", generates \"GP\"(2,1), with a \"T\" multiplier of 7. A clockwise and counterclockwise whirl generator, \"w\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"wrw\" generates \"GP\"(7,0) in class 1. In general, a whirl can transform a GP(\"a\",\"b\") into GP(\"a\"\u00a0+\u00a03\"b\",2\"ab\") for \"a\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0\"b\" and the same chiral direction. If chiral directions are reversed, GP(\"a\",\"b\") becomes GP(2\"a\"\u00a0+\u00a03\"b\",\"a\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a02\"b\") if \"a\"\u00a0\u2265\u00a02\"b\", and GP(3\"a\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"b\",2\"b\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"a\") if \"a\"\u00a0&lt;\u00a02\"b\"."
