    "text": "Lidia Zamenhof (; 29 January 1904\u20131942) was a &lt;a href=\"Poles\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; writer, publisher, translator and the youngest daughter of Klara (Silbernik) and &lt;a href=\"L.%20L.%20Zamenhof\"&gt;L. L. Zamenhof&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of &lt;a href=\"Esperanto\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;. She was an active promoter of Esperanto as well as of &lt;a href=\"Homaranismo\"&gt;Homaranismo&lt;/a&gt;, a form of &lt;a href=\"religious%20humanism\"&gt;religious humanism&lt;/a&gt; first defined by her father.\nAround 1925 she became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith&lt;/a&gt;. In late 1937 she went to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to teach that religion as well as Esperanto. In December 1938 she returned to Poland, where she continued to teach and translated many &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20literature\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed writings&lt;/a&gt;. \u05bfShe was murdered at the &lt;a href=\"Treblinka%20extermination%20camp\"&gt;Treblinka extermination camp&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"the%20Holocaust\"&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nLidia Zamenhof learned Esperanto as a nine-year-old girl. By the age of fourteen she translated from &lt;a href=\"Polish%20literature\"&gt;Polish literature&lt;/a&gt;; her first publications appeared several years thereafter. Having completed her university studies in &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; in 1925, she dedicated herself totally to working for Esperanto. In the same year during the 17th &lt;a href=\"World%20Congress%20of%20Esperanto\"&gt;World Congress of Esperanto&lt;/a&gt; in 1925 in &lt;a href=\"Geneva\"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; she became acquainted with the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith&lt;/a&gt;. Lidia Zamenhof became secretary of the &lt;a href=\"homaranismo\"&gt;homaranistic&lt;/a&gt; Esperanto-Society Concord in &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; and often made arrangements for speakers and courses. Starting at the &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; World Congress of Esperanto in 1924 she attended almost every World Congress (she missed the 1938 Universala Kongreso in England). As an instructor of the &lt;a href=\"Andreo%20Cseh\"&gt;Cseh method&lt;/a&gt; of teaching Esperanto she made many promotional trips and taught many courses in various countries.\nShe actively coordinated her work with the student Esperanto movement \u2014 in the International Student League, in the &lt;a href=\"World%20Esperanto%20Association\"&gt;UEA&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"International%20Cseh%20Institute%20of%20Esperanto\"&gt;Cseh Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. Additionally, Lidia wrote for the journal \"&lt;a href=\"Literatura%20Mondo\"&gt;Literatura Mondo&lt;/a&gt;\" (mainly studies on Polish Literature), and also contributed to \"&lt;a href=\"Pola%20Esperantisto\"&gt;Pola Esperantisto&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Praktiko\"&gt;La Praktiko&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Heroldo%20de%20Esperanto\"&gt;Heroldo de Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Enciklopedio%20de%20Esperanto\"&gt;Enciklopedio de Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;\". Her translation of \"&lt;a href=\"Quo%20Vadis%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Quo Vadis&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Henryk%20Sienkiewicz\"&gt;Henryk Sienkiewicz&lt;/a&gt; was published in 1933 and is very well known.\nIn 1937 she went to the United States for a long stay. In December 1938 she had to leave the United States because that country's &lt;a href=\"Immigration%20and%20Naturalization%20Service\"&gt;Immigration Service&lt;/a&gt; declined to extend her tourist visitor's visa because of her allegedly illegal \"paid labor\" of teaching Esperanto. She refused offers of marriage that could have permitted her to remain or eventually to naturalize. After returning to Poland, her homeland, she travelled around the country teaching Esperanto and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nUnder the German occupation regime of 1939, her home in Warsaw became part of the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Ghetto\"&gt;Warsaw Ghetto&lt;/a&gt;. She was arrested under the charge of having gone to the United States to spread anti-Nazi propaganda, but after a few months, she was released and returned to her home city where she and the rest of her family remained confined. There she endeavored to help others get medicine and food. She was offered help and escape several times by Polish Esperantists but refused in each case. To one &lt;a href=\"Poles\"&gt;Pole&lt;/a&gt;, well-known Esperantist &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zef%20Arszennik\"&gt;J\u00f3zef Arszennik&lt;/a&gt;, who had offered her refuge on several occasions, she explained, \"you and your family could lose your lives, because whoever hides a Jew perishes along with the Jew who is discovered.\" To another, her explanation was contained in her last known letter: \"Do not think of putting yourself in danger; I know that I must die but I feel it is my duty to stay with my people. God grant that out of our sufferings a better world may emerge. I believe in God. I am a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed and will die a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed. Everything is in His hands.\"\nEventually in the end she was swept up in the mass transport heading to the extermination camp in &lt;a href=\"Treblinka\"&gt;Treblinka&lt;/a&gt; in the course of the &lt;a href=\"Grossaktion%20Warsaw%20%281942%29\"&gt;Grossaktion Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;. She was killed there sometime after the summer of 1942.\nMemorial.\nIn her memory and honor, a meeting was held in 1995 at the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Holocaust%20Memorial%20Museum\"&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; The meeting called attention to Esperantists' efforts to save persecuted Jews during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrama.\nThe documentary drama \"Ni vivos!\" (\"We will live!\") by &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Modest\"&gt;Julian Modest&lt;/a&gt; depicts the Zamenhof family's fate in the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Ghetto\"&gt;Warsaw Ghetto&lt;/a&gt;."
