    "text": "The Day They Shot a Hole in the Jesus Egg (subtitled \"The Priest Driven Ambulance Album, Demos, and Outtakes, 1989-1991\") is a 2xCD compilation of material by &lt;a href=\"The%20Flaming%20Lips\"&gt;The Flaming Lips&lt;/a&gt; released by &lt;a href=\"Restless%20Records\"&gt;Restless Records&lt;/a&gt; in late 2002. It is the second of two reissues compiling the band's work with the record label, and follows \"&lt;a href=\"Finally%20the%20Punk%20Rockers%20Are%20Taking%20Acid\"&gt;Finally the Punk Rockers Are Taking Acid&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe first disc contains the album \"&lt;a href=\"In%20a%20Priest%20Driven%20Ambulance\"&gt;In a Priest Driven Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;\", followed by related B-sides from that era. The second disc contains a much-bootlegged series of demos called \"The Mushroom Tapes\", featuring early versions and alternate mixes of \"Ambulance\" tracks.\nThe first disc of this set was released on vinyl as a limited-edition, pink-colored two-record set under the title of \"In a Priest Driven Ambulance\".\nThe compilation is named after a line from the Flaming Lips song \"Five Stop Mother Superior Rain\". It also includes new liner notes from band frontman &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Coyne\"&gt;Wayne Coyne&lt;/a&gt;."
