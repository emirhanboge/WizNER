    "text": "USCGC \"Point Clear\" (WPB-82315) was an &lt;a href=\"Point%20class%20cutter\"&gt;Point class cutter&lt;/a&gt; constructed at the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard%20Yard\"&gt;Coast Guard Yard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Curtis%20Bay%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Curtis Bay, Maryland&lt;/a&gt; in 1961 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1960 was not to name &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard%20Cutter\"&gt;cutters&lt;/a&gt; under in length, it was designated as \"WPB-82315\" when commissioned and acquired the name \"Point Clear\" in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .\nConstruction and design details.\n\"Point Clear\" was built to accommodate an 8-man crew. She was powered by two VT600 &lt;a href=\"Cummins\"&gt;Cummins&lt;/a&gt; diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.\nThe design specifications for \"Point Clear\" included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer &lt;a href=\"Watch%20system\"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The &lt;a href=\"Propeller\"&gt;screw&lt;/a&gt;s were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a &lt;a href=\"ship%20floodability\"&gt;watertight door&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"starboard%20side\"&gt;starboard side&lt;/a&gt; aft of the &lt;a href=\"deckhouse\"&gt;deckhouse&lt;/a&gt;. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, &lt;a href=\"scuttlebutt\"&gt;scuttlebutt&lt;/a&gt;, a small desk and &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mess\"&gt;mess&lt;/a&gt; and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess &lt;a href=\"Bulkhead%20%28partition%29\"&gt;bulkhead&lt;/a&gt; led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode. Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.\nHistory.\nAfter delivery in 1961, \"Point Clear\" was assigned a homeport of &lt;a href=\"San%20Pedro%2C%20California\"&gt;San Pedro, California&lt;/a&gt;, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.\nAt the request of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;, in April 1965, she was alerted for service in &lt;a href=\"South%20Vietnam\"&gt;South Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; and assigned to &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Guard%20Squadron%20One\"&gt;Coast Guard Squadron One&lt;/a&gt; in support of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Market%20Time\"&gt;Operation Market Time&lt;/a&gt; along with 16 other Point class cutters. While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Guard%20Island\"&gt;Coast Guard Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parks%20Reserve%20Forces%20Training%20Area\"&gt;Camp Parks, California&lt;/a&gt;, \"Point Clear\" was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to &lt;a href=\"Subic%20Bay\"&gt;Subic Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; in May 1965 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of four &lt;a href=\"M2%20Browning%20machine%20gun\"&gt;M2 machine guns&lt;/a&gt;. The original bow mounted machine gun was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81\u00a0mm trigger fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam. For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.\n\"Point Clear\" was assigned to Division 11 of Squadron One to be based at &lt;a href=\"An%20Thoi%20Naval%20Base\"&gt;An Thoi Naval Base&lt;/a&gt; on the southern tip of &lt;a href=\"Ph%C3%BA%20Qu%E1%BB%91c\"&gt;Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c&lt;/a&gt; island along with , , , , , , and . After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for An Thoi on 17 July 1965 in the company of , their temporary support ship. After almost two weeks at sea, they arrived at their new duty station on 1 August and began patrolling the waters in the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Thailand\"&gt;Gulf of Thailand&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A0%20Mau%20Peninsula\"&gt;C\u00e0 Mau Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and check the identification papers of persons on board. During September 1965, , a repair ship outfitted for the repair of WPB's relieved the USS \"Floyd County\". Also during this time, the WPB's were directed to paint the hulls and superstructures formula 20 deck gray to cover the stateside white paint. This increased the effectiveness of night patrols.\n\"Point Clear\" was credited with helping stop the overrun of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;Army of the Republic of Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; outpost at &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A0%20Ti%C3%AAn\"&gt;H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean&lt;/a&gt; on 20 October 1965 by firing her machine guns and lobbing mortar rounds near the perimeter of the compound. On 14 February 1966, \"Point Clear\" came to the rescue of a U.S. Navy &lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Craft%20Fast\"&gt;Patrol Craft Fast&lt;/a&gt; (PCF) which had been sunk by a command detonated mine in shallow water near &lt;a href=\"R%E1%BA%A1ch%20Gi%C3%A1\"&gt;R\u1ea1ch Gi\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;. She provided covering fire with machine guns and the 81\u00a0mm mortar while Navy personnel from other PCFs evacuated the injured and recovered bodies and equipment from the wreckage.\nOn 15 September 1969, \"Point Clear\" was turned over to the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Navy\"&gt;Republic of Vietnam Navy&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Vietnamization\"&gt;Vietnamization&lt;/a&gt; of the war effort and recommissioned as RVNS \"Hu\u1ef3nh V\u0103n \u0110\u1ee9c\" (HQ-702)."
