    "text": "Lois is a common English &lt;a href=\"Given%20name\"&gt;name&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"New%20Testament\"&gt;New Testament&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Paul%20the%20Apostle\"&gt;Paul the Apostle&lt;/a&gt; mentions &lt;a href=\"Lois%20%28Bible%29\"&gt;Lois&lt;/a&gt;, the pious grandmother of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Timothy\"&gt;Saint Timothy&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Epistle%20to%20Timothy\"&gt;Second Epistle to Timothy&lt;/a&gt; (commending her for her faith in 2 Timothy 1:5). The name was first used by English Christians after the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Protestant Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, and it was popular, particularly in North America, during the first half of the 20th century.\nAs male name.\nIn French, Lo\u00efs is a male name, as in the fictional comic strip adventures of Lo\u00efs Lorcey by &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Martin%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Jacques Martin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name Lo\u00efs is derived from the name &lt;a href=\"Louis%20%28given%20name%29\"&gt;Louis&lt;/a&gt;, itself derived from &lt;a href=\"Clovis%20%28given%20name%29\"&gt;Clovis&lt;/a&gt; which is derived from the Germanic root, Hlodowig, which can be interpreted in the sense of \"glorious\" or \"illustrious fighter\". Lois is thus related to this illustrious royal first name whose prestigious consonance remains intact to this day in France.\nClose names include Louys, Luis, Louis, Lorys, Lucio, Leonus, Louniss, Lyes, Clovis, Ludovic, Ludwig, Lovis, and Luigi."
