    "text": "Sir Charles Montague Lush (7 December 1853 \u2013 22 June 1930) was a British judge.\nThe son of the judge &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Lush\"&gt;Sir Robert Lush&lt;/a&gt;, Lush was educated at &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20School\"&gt;Westminster School&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Hall%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Trinity Hall, Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, where he took a &lt;a href=\"British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; in Classics in 1876. He was &lt;a href=\"Call%20to%20the%20bar\"&gt;called to the bar&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Gray%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Gray's Inn&lt;/a&gt; in 1879, and joined the North Eastern Circuit. He &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Counsel\"&gt;took silk&lt;/a&gt; in 1902.\nIn 1910, Lush was appointed to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20of%20Justice\"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt; and assigned to the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Bench%20Division\"&gt;King's Bench Division&lt;/a&gt;, receiving the customary &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Bachelor\"&gt;knighthood&lt;/a&gt; on 13 October 1910. In 1915 he was appointed as President of the &lt;a href=\"Railway%20and%20Canal%20Commission\"&gt;Railway and Canal Commission&lt;/a&gt;. He retired from the bench in 1925 due to deafness, and was made a Privy Counsellor the same year, although he never sat on the &lt;a href=\"Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council\"&gt;Judicial Committee of the Privy Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough highly regarded as a barrister, he was not a successful judge: he was said to be too diffident and sometimes let personal feelings influence his decisions."
