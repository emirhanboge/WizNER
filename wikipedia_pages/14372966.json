As a goalkeeper of great talent, he played many games for the &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Hungary National Youth Team&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the 13 and &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Senior National Team&lt;/a&gt;. After his playing days were over, he devoted much of his time to coaching and teaching young soccer players on the highest level.\nManagerial career.\nFrom 1977 to 1982, he worked as the coaching director for the &lt;a href=\"MTK%20Budapest\"&gt;MTK Budapest&lt;/a&gt;'s youth programme, and from 1982 to 1986 he was the Youth Coach Director for the &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Hungarian national football team&lt;/a&gt;. As one of his greatest achievements on that level, under his coaching and guidance, the &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Under-18 National Team of Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, captured the European Youth Championship in Moscow, in 1984.\nBefore moving on to the senior level, Bicskei successfully completed the, work, and graduated at the world-renowned soccer academy in &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;, Germany in 1986. He is one of just a few Hungarian-born coaches who was able to earn one of the most respected coaching diplomas in the world. While in Germany, he also studied philosophy, and learned to speak excellent German.\nIn 1987/88 Bicskei become head coach of &lt;a href=\"Honv%C3%A9d%20Budapest\"&gt;Honv\u00e9d Budapest&lt;/a&gt;, (that year, Honv\u00e9d won the National title and the Hungarian cup) and his professional career was off to a flying start. In 1989, he, was selected to coach the &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;senior national team of Hungary&lt;/a&gt;.

During his stay in &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, he started working on his book, \"Preparation of Young Footballs\", a soccer achievement that not only complements, but also challenges everything that was written thus far on teaching young soccer players to achieve the highest level. After returning home, he coached Honv\u00e9d Budapest once again, 1996/97 seasons, and he was technical director at &lt;a href=\"RABA%20ETO%20Gy%C5%91r\"&gt;RABA ETO Gy\u0151r&lt;/a&gt; in the 1998/99 seasons.\nBetween 1998 and 2001 he served his second stint as the national coach of Hungary, later becoming the technical director of the Hungarian Football Federation between 2006 and mid-2008.\nIn the second half of 2004, the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Malaysia\"&gt;Football Association of Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; selected Bertalan Bicskei, to succeed &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Harris\"&gt;Allan Harris&lt;/a&gt;. Bicskei led the national side to third place at the regional &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Cup\"&gt;Tiger Cup&lt;/a&gt; competition, but was demoted to youth development duties by FAM for his actions during a friendly against &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Penang\"&gt;Penang&lt;/a&gt; on 8 June 2005. Bicskei, disgusted by the standard of officiating, threw a bottle onto the pitch before confronting a Singapore player. In September 2005 the contract was terminated after mutual agreement.\nBicskei was given the job of &lt;a href=\"Liberia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Liberia&lt;/a&gt;'s national coach in July 2010 on a four-year contract, but had to take a leave of absence in February 2011 after being poisoned in Liberia.\nDeath.\nOn 16 July 2011, Bicskei died in &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; after a long battle with illness. He was 67 years old. The death of Bicskei was described as a loss to \"a very important part of Hungarian football\"."
