    "text": " is a 2006 &lt;a href=\"racing%20video%20game\"&gt;racing video game&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"GameCube\"&gt;GameCube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; in which the player controls characters from the \"&lt;a href=\"Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog\"&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/a&gt;\" series on &lt;a href=\"hoverboard\"&gt;hoverboard&lt;/a&gt;s. In the game's 16 tracks, the player competes against characters\u2014either controlled by computers or other players\u2014in story and battle modes. It was developed by &lt;a href=\"Sonic%20Team\"&gt;Sonic Team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Now%20Production\"&gt;Now Production&lt;/a&gt;, published by &lt;a href=\"Sega\"&gt;Sega&lt;/a&gt;, and released in February 2006 in Japan and North America. It was released in Europe the following month and for &lt;a href=\"Windows\"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the year. A &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt; version, developed by &lt;a href=\"Backbone%20Entertainment\"&gt;Backbone Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, was canceled.\nThe game was produced in commemoration of the \"Sonic\" series' 15th anniversary and was the first \"Sonic\" racing game since the 1997 &lt;a href=\"Traveller%27s%20Tales\"&gt;Traveller's Tales&lt;/a&gt; game \"&lt;a href=\"Sonic%20R\"&gt;Sonic R&lt;/a&gt;\". Sonic Team wanted to make their own game that was superior to any previous \"Sonic\" racing game. It was designed to appeal to fans of \"Sonic\" and &lt;a href=\"extreme%20sports\"&gt;extreme sports&lt;/a&gt; video games; the development team did not take inspiration from any prior games. \"Sonic Riders\" was also the last \"Sonic\" title produced with the involvement of franchise co-creator &lt;a href=\"Yuji%20Naka\"&gt;Yuji Naka&lt;/a&gt;, who acted as executive producer and left Sega shortly after its release.\n\"Sonic Riders\" was released to mixed reviews but was a commercial success and was later re-released under the GameCube and PlayStation 2 bestseller lines. Reviewers criticized its gameplay, controls, and overall design; praise was directed at the visual style, soundtrack and the sense of speed while racing. Overall, they deemed it a lackluster game\u2014both within the \"Sonic\" franchise and the racing game medium\u2014that had its highlights but ultimately fell to its shortcomings. Despite the mixed reviews, two sequels, \"\" (2008) and \"&lt;a href=\"Sonic%20Free%20Riders\"&gt;Sonic Free Riders&lt;/a&gt;\" (2010), were developed and released.\nGameplay.\n\"Sonic Riders\" is based around characters racing each other using devices known as \"Extreme Gear\", anti-gravity-equipped vehicles consisting of hover boards, hover skates, and hover bikes. Players compete to finish three laps around a racetrack before their opponents and complete the race in first place. Each race features up to eight characters competing. A key component of gameplay is the air tank, displayed in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. Air serves as the fuel for Extreme Gear, and is depleted gradually as the race goes on. Characters can also perform a Boost, which will give them a sudden burst of speed at the cost of a significant amount of air. If a player boosts into an opponent, their character will attack and stun the opponent for a brief period. Air is also more quickly spent using techniques like cornering, which allows the player to round sharp turns with ease, and building tension before a jump, which involves using the air to propel the player higher off of ramps. If a player runs out of air, their character will start running on foot; this prevents them from boosting, attacking, cornering easily or using charged jumps. Players can refill their air by using pit stops on the track, which force them to stay in place while their air meter recharges, or performing tricks when jumping off ramps or off opponents' &lt;a href=\"slipstream\"&gt;slipstream&lt;/a&gt;, with higher-rated tricks sequences restoring more air. Players can also collect rings scattered across the track; collecting a certain number of rings will cause their character to level up for the remainder of the race, increasing the strength of their attacks and extending their maximum air capacity.\n\"Sonic Riders\" features 16 playable characters, including guest characters from \"&lt;a href=\"Nights%20into%20Dreams\"&gt;Nights into Dreams&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Space%20Channel%205\"&gt;Space Channel 5&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Super%20Monkey%20Ball\"&gt;Super Monkey Ball&lt;/a&gt;\". Each individual character has different statistics, altering their performance slightly in races, though some characters are restricted from using certain types of Extreme Gear. Characters are divided into one of three classes, each with different abilities: Speed characters can grind on rails, Power characters can break certain objects, and Fly characters can fly through boost rings. Each race track features multiple shortcuts that can only be accessed by characters of a specific class. Players can spend the rings they acquire at the in-game shop to purchase new Extreme Gear, each of which possesses unique statistics and properties. The game includes eight unique areas, each with two track variants, for a total of 16 tracks. Only five tracks are accessible from the start; the remainder are unlocked through progression in the game's story mode and by winning Gold in both the World Grand Prix tournaments, in which players race through five consecutive tracks and attempt to get the highest overall score.\nThe game's Story Mode is divided into two campaigns, whose events intersect with one another: The \"Heroes\" story, focusing on &lt;a href=\"Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29\"&gt;Sonic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tails%20%28Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%29\"&gt;Tails&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Knuckles%20the%20Echidna\"&gt;Knuckles&lt;/a&gt;; and the \"Babylon\" story, focusing on the &lt;a href=\"Babylon%20Rogues\"&gt;Babylon Rogues&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of new characters Jet the Hawk, Wave the Swallow, and Storm the Albatross. In each campaign, players take part in consecutive races with predetermined characters, and must take first place in each race to continue the story. Completing the Heroes campaign unlocks the Babylon campaign, which includes an epilogue in which the two stories converge. The game also features a Mission Mode with 100 missions to complete, each of which tasks the players with completing a specific objective within a time limit, such as collecting objects on the track or destroying a certain number of obstacles. Completing each mission awards players a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on their performance; by completing missions, players can unlock new characters and special Extreme Gear. Up to four players can also compete in the game's single race and battle modes.\nPlot.\nJet, leader of the thieving Babylon Rogues, observes the Key to Babylon Garden, an artifact and family heirloom said to unlock the secrets of their Babylonian ancestors. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Eggman\"&gt;Doctor Eggman&lt;/a&gt; arrives and claims he can use the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Emeralds\"&gt;Chaos Emeralds&lt;/a&gt; to make Babylon Garden rise, asking for the Rogues' help in retrieving them. The Rogues agree and steal an Emerald, but run into Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, who are also looking for the Emerald. Sonic gives chase, but Jet escapes with the Emerald. The next day, the three heroes see Eggman on a digital billboard advertising an Extreme Gear race known as the EX World Grand Prix, with the Chaos Emeralds offered as the grand prize. When they realize that the Rogues are participating, Sonic and his friends enter as well.\nTeam Sonic, joined by &lt;a href=\"Amy%20Rose\"&gt;Amy Rose&lt;/a&gt;, compete with the Rogues in several races. During the final race, Wave sabotages Sonic's board, allowing Jet to defeat Sonic and win the Grand Prix. Jet uses the Chaos Emeralds to make Babylon Garden appear, hoping to discover the legendary treasure of the Babylonians. Eggman steals the Key from Jet, intent on taking the treasure for himself, and heads for the garden, with Amy grabbing Eggman's ship in an attempt to stop him. Sonic grabs a new board and pursues Eggman, but Jet challenges him to another race, seeking to defeat Eggman first. The two arrive at Babylon Garden and find Eggman, who is holding Amy hostage. Combining their powers, Jet and Sonic manage to retrieve Amy and the Key.\nJet uses the Key to open a secret door, leading the Rogues inside a Babylonian ruin. Team Sonic follow them inside, where they encounter the Babylon Guardian, a giant creature tasked with protecting the treasure. The two teams defeat the Guardian, causing a chest to appear. Eggman returns and demands they give him the treasure, but passes out in confusion upon discovering the treasure is only a carpet. Using the Key, Jet manages to make the carpet fly, revealing the &lt;a href=\"magic%20carpet\"&gt;magic carpet&lt;/a&gt; to be an early form of Extreme Gear. Team Sonic and the Babylon Rogues go their separate ways, with Jet promising to race Sonic again one day.\nDevelopment.\n\"Sonic Riders\" was developed by &lt;a href=\"Sonic%20Team\"&gt;Sonic Team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Now%20Production\"&gt;Now Production&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"GameCube\"&gt;GameCube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Windows\"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; in commemoration of the \"Sonic\" series' 15th anniversary. The game was directed by Kenjiro Morimoto and produced by Takashi Yuda. Series co-creator &lt;a href=\"Yuji%20Naka\"&gt;Yuji Naka&lt;/a&gt; served as executive producer. \"Sonic Riders\" was the last \"Sonic\" game that Naka was involved with; he resigned to form his own company, &lt;a href=\"Prope\"&gt;Prope&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after its release to focus on original games. Yuda said Naka provided input at the beginning of development and additional advice as the game progressed. The game runs at 60 &lt;a href=\"frames%20per%20second\"&gt;frames per second&lt;/a&gt;, and features a 2D animated opening cutscene produced by &lt;a href=\"Production%20I.G\"&gt;Production I.G&lt;/a&gt; and directed by &lt;a href=\"Kazuto%20Nakazawa\"&gt;Kazuto Nakazawa&lt;/a&gt;, as well as CG-animated cutscenes by &lt;a href=\"Blur%20Studio\"&gt;Blur Studio&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe game was the series' first racing game since &lt;a href=\"Travellers%27%20Tales\"&gt;Travellers' Tales&lt;/a&gt; developed \"&lt;a href=\"Sonic%20R\"&gt;Sonic R&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1997. According to Yuda, in the years after \"Sonic R\"s release, Sonic Team received many requests from fans for another \"Sonic\" racer. Though he played and enjoyed \"Sonic R\", Yuda believed Sonic Team, \"who knows Sonic best\", should make another game that was superior to any previous \"Sonic\" racing game. Yuda also did not want to make a conventional racing game, instead desiring a dynamic, unique style of gameplay that would allow the player to perform tricks. Being able to do this in a car was illogical; Sonic Team noted that surfing and snowboarding were more flexible. As the concept had a heavy emphasis on air, hoverboards were chosen since they could work in any environment and still be fun to use.\n\"Sonic Riders\" was primarily designed to appeal to fans of \"Sonic\" and &lt;a href=\"extreme%20sport\"&gt;extreme sport&lt;/a&gt;s games, while the multiplayer modes were included for casual gamers. Yuda has said Sonic Team did not take any influences from prior \"Sonic\" games, reasoning they wanted to create a truly new experience that was unlike anything else from other \"Sonic\" games. The characters were chosen based on how relevant to the game's story they would be. The game's antagonists, the Babylon Rogues, were created because Sonic Team wanted to include \"Air Pirates\" as Sonic's rivals. Yuda considered them best-suited for \"Sonic\" series racing games, and noted \"Sonic \"characters are usually designed with one specific storyline in mind. Levels were designed to be \"crazy\" but still feature classic \"Sonic\" elements.\nThe score was composed by &lt;a href=\"Tomonori%20Sawada\"&gt;Tomonori Sawada&lt;/a&gt;, Fumie Kumatani, and Kenichi Tokoi. Two vocal themes were written for the game and performed by the artist Runblebee, \"Sonic Speed Riders\" (written by Sawada) and \"Catch Me If You Can\" (written by Runblebee). Yuda said the music was written to be \"fast paced and give you that heart pounding feeling you should have during a high-speed race\". A soundtrack album, \"Sonic Riders Original Soundtrack \"Speedbeats Grand Prix\"\", was released in March 2006.\n\"Sonic Riders\" was announced in the September 2005 issue of \"&lt;a href=\"Famitsu\"&gt;Famitsu&lt;/a&gt;\", before being showcased at the &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Game%20Show\"&gt;Tokyo Game Show&lt;/a&gt; later that month. The console versions were released in North America on February 21, 2006, Japan on February 23, 2006, Europe on March 17, 2006, and Australia on March 23, 2006. The Windows version was released in late 2006. A &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt; (GBA) version was developed by &lt;a href=\"Backbone%20Entertainment\"&gt;Backbone Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; but never released. According to artist Keith Erickson, it used an \"&lt;a href=\"Out%20Run\"&gt;Out Run&lt;/a&gt;\"-style &lt;a href=\"game%20engine\"&gt;game engine&lt;/a&gt; and was supposed to launch at the same time as the other versions. Sega of Japan learned of this version and requested that Backbone add more 3D elements but keep it on the same production schedule. This would have required the engine to be completely rewritten, something Backbone considered impossible, so Sega canceled it.\nReception.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"review%20aggregator\"&gt;review aggregator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Metacritic\"&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, \"Sonic Riders\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews. Throughout 2006, the game sold 930,000 copies. The GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions were later branded as part of the &lt;a href=\"Player%27s%20Choice\"&gt;Player's Choice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greatest%20Hits%20%28PlayStation%29\"&gt;Greatest Hits&lt;/a&gt; budget lines, indicating strong sales.\nThe game's presentation received mixed reactions from reviewers. \"&lt;a href=\"GameSpot\"&gt;GameSpot&lt;/a&gt;\" thought the visuals were well-produced and praised the brightly colored levels and character models, but noted frame rate drops and thought the environments looked \"kind of drab and muddy\" when the gameplay slowed down. \"&lt;a href=\"GameSpy\"&gt;GameSpy&lt;/a&gt;\" agreed and cited the graphics as one of the best parts of the game. \"&lt;a href=\"IGN\"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt;\" was more conflicted: they praised the graphical effects and backgrounds, but were critical of the blocky geometry and blurry textures and thought it was not as pretty as competing games. \"Nintendo World Report\" (\"NWR\") also called the graphics inconsistent. Of the game's music, \"IGN\" and \"GameSpot\" agreed it was just generic \"Sonic\" melodies, but \"IGN\" wrote the game had \"a few surprisingly ambient and worldly tracks that ... better fit with the themes of the different locales.\" \"NWR\" called the soundtrack fitting.\nReviewers criticized or had little praise for the core gameplay and controls. \"&lt;a href=\"GamesRadar%2B\"&gt;GamesRadar+&lt;/a&gt;\" derided the loose, floaty &lt;a href=\"physics%20engine\"&gt;physics engine&lt;/a&gt;, writing it caused cheap deaths. \"&lt;a href=\"Eurogamer\"&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/a&gt;\" thought the premise showed promise and worked well as races started, but found it ultimately became messy, complicated, and convoluted. \"IGN\" lamented that the game was \"neither a full-fledged racer or an engaging snowboarder, but a shallow compromise of both.\" They also found the hoverboards were technically pointless when considering that Sonic is fast on his own. \"GameSpy\" described the gameplay design of racing, attacking opponents, and performing tricks as inconsistent: \"Most games quickly prioritize these actions for you based on results,\" they wrote, \"but \"Sonic Riders\" seems to yield similar results no matter what\".\nStill, the game's sense of speed was generally praised. \"IGN\" wrote \"Sonic Team has done a solid job of delivering on speed and anarchy\" and cited the pace as making races unpredictable and fun. \"GameSpot\" agreed and described the turbulence-riding as inventive. \"Eurogamer\" thought the speed was exciting and wrote it reminded them of the original &lt;a href=\"Sega%20Genesis\"&gt;Sega Genesis&lt;/a&gt; \"Sonic\" games. \"&lt;a href=\"GamePro\"&gt;GamePro&lt;/a&gt;\" was more critical, agreeing with \"Eurogamer\" the speed was exciting but feeling that it made the game feel \"more like a surreal rollercoaster ride than a game\". Difficulty maintaining speed was noted by many reviewers. \"GamesRadar+\" called it \"almost impossible... Clipping a corner or bumping into a wall can bring your 200mph screamfest to a complete halt\", and \"Eurogamer\" wrote it was the game's biggest flaw. The pitstop system was especially criticized; \"GameSpy\" wrote it made no sense for a \"Sonic\" game, and \"GameSpot\" said it sucked the fun out of \"Sonic Riders\".\nOverall, reviewers deemed \"Sonic Riders\" an average entry in the \"Sonic\" franchise. \"IGN\" believed it was an improvement from the series' previous game \"&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;Shadow the Hedgehog&lt;/a&gt;\" and would be fun for \"Sonic\" fans, but was nonetheless found its design choices questionable and felt it simply existed to cash in on the popularity of snowboarding game franchises like \"&lt;a href=\"SSX%20%28series%29\"&gt;SSX&lt;/a&gt;\". \"GameSpot\" said the game was occasionally entertaining but suffered from lackluster gameplay, and \"GamesRadar+\" thought it proved that the once iconic \"Sonic\" franchise \"has now become a dumping ground for half-baked games.\"\nSequels.\nA sequel to \"Sonic Riders\", titled \"\", was released in 2008 for the Wii and PlayStation 2. A third title, \"&lt;a href=\"Sonic%20Free%20Riders\"&gt;Sonic Free Riders&lt;/a&gt;\", developed by O-Two, was released as a launch title for the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kinect\"&gt;Kinect&lt;/a&gt; peripheral on November 4, 2010."
