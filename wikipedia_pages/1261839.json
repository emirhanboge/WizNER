    "text": "Sensurround is the brand name for a process developed by &lt;a href=\"Cerwin-Vega\"&gt;Cerwin-Vega&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Studios\"&gt;Universal Studios&lt;/a&gt; to enhance the audio experience during film screenings, specifically for the 1974 film \"&lt;a href=\"Earthquake%20%281974%20film%29\"&gt;Earthquake&lt;/a&gt;\". The process was intended for subsequent use and was adopted for four more films, \"&lt;a href=\"Midway%20%281976%20film%29\"&gt;Midway&lt;/a&gt;\" (1976), \"&lt;a href=\"Rollercoaster%20%281977%20film%29\"&gt;Rollercoaster&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977), the theatrical version of \"&lt;a href=\"Saga%20of%20a%20Star%20World\"&gt;Saga of a Star World&lt;/a&gt;\" (1978), the \"&lt;a href=\"Battlestar%20Galactica\"&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt;\" pilot, as well as the compilation film \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Battlestar%20Galactica%20%281978%2C%201980%29%20episodes%23Feature%20length%20films\"&gt;Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack&lt;/a&gt;\" (1979). Sensurround worked by adding extended-range bass for &lt;a href=\"sound%20effect\"&gt;sound effect&lt;/a&gt;s. The low-frequency sounds were more felt than heard, providing a vivid complement to onscreen depictions of earth tremors, bomber formations, and amusement park rides. The overall trend toward \"&lt;a href=\"Multiplex%20%28movie%20theater%29\"&gt;multiplex&lt;/a&gt;\" cinema structures presented challenges that made Sensurround impractical as a permanent feature of cinema.\nSensurround helped bring wider recognition to established &lt;a href=\"loudspeaker\"&gt;loudspeaker&lt;/a&gt; manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Cerwin-Vega\"&gt;Cerwin-Vega&lt;/a&gt;, and aided in establishing a strong reputation for new &lt;a href=\"audio%20amplifier\"&gt;audio amplifier&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href=\"BGW%20Systems\"&gt;BGW Systems&lt;/a&gt;. The increased awareness of extended low-frequency sound reproduction that Sensurround brought to film audiences was a factor in the increase in &lt;a href=\"subwoofer\"&gt;subwoofer&lt;/a&gt; sales and in the rise in the number of subwoofer designs in the late 1970s and 1980s.\nDevelopment.\nOriginal design.\nSensurround involved the installation of large, low frequency, horn-loaded speakers which contained specially designed 18-inch Cerwin-Vega Model 189 ES drivers in custom black wood cabinets. Three horn configurations were available, Model-C (Corner), Model-W (Folded Bass Bin) and Model-M (Modular). The Model-C and -M horns required stacking in groups of four, increasing effective horn mouth size to achieve the low frequency target. They came with special extenders used to widen the mouths of the horns and take advantage of the theater walls to further increase low frequency extension. The Model-M horn had a dedicated \"Mouth-Extender\" available when it was used in the front of the theater. While installation was customized and varied in each theater, the Sensurround horns were typically placed beneath the screen in front and in the back corners of the theater. Often, rows or sections of seats would have to be removed to make room for the large Sensurround horns. In large theaters, up to 20 individual horns might be used along with custom-built bat wings and mouth extenders.\nThe original Sensurround design used for \"Earthquake\" employed a &lt;a href=\"Pseudorandom%20number%20generator\"&gt;pseudorandom noise generator&lt;/a&gt;, designed by D. Broadus \"Don\" Keele, Jr., to create the low-frequency rumble, using recordings of the 1971 &lt;a href=\"Sylmar%20earthquake\"&gt;Sylmar earthquake&lt;/a&gt; as a reference. Two low frequency control tones were printed on the film's mono optical or magnetic track; from the projector, the tones entered a control box in the projection booth, which fed low frequency pseudorandom noise to 1,600\u00a0watt BGW 750 audio amplifiers driving the speakers. The control box generated a pseudorandom noise signal with energy between 17 and 120\u00a0Hz. The control track method was employed because there was no way to accurately record bass lower than 40\u00a0Hz on an optical or magnetic film soundtrack at the time. When receiving the noise signal, the amplifier and subwoofers responded with sound pressures ranging from 100\u00a0dB to 120\u00a0dB. The resulting rumble could be felt by audience members as well as heard.\nFor the film \"Earthquake\", Sensurround was activated during the quake scenes to augment the conventional soundtrack. In addition, portions of the main soundtrack were redirected to the Sensurround horns to create a partial &lt;a href=\"surround%20sound\"&gt;surround sound&lt;/a&gt; effect. The control tones recorded on the film's optical or magnetic track triggered the rumble or surround sound effects as well as controlling their volume and the overall blend of the main soundtrack and low frequency noise effects. Two tones of 25\u00a0Hz and 35\u00a0Hz were used: these two tones allowed different effects to be activated when desired: the rumble could be turned on or off in the Sensurround horns, the main soundtrack could be sent to the Sensurround horns, the level of both the rumble and the soundtrack coming from the horns could be varied by varying the level of the control tones and the theater's main audio system could be increased in level by up to 8\u00a0dB at select points to create a greater dynamic range (MCA called this the \"Step-Gain\" function.)\nFor the original version of Sensurround, prints were available in the following formats:\nSensurround Mod-II.\nEven before \"Earthquake\" ended its theatrical run, MCA began a program to re-engineer the Sensurround system to enable the recording of the deep bass on a standard 35mm optical soundtrack, with no external rumble generator being required, as well as improve fidelity and the overall effect and to simplify the system. In addition, &lt;a href=\"dbx%20%28noise%20reduction%29\"&gt;dbx Type-II noise reduction&lt;/a&gt; was incorporated to increase the dynamic range and reduce audible noise created by the optical process. MCA also changed the way the control tones were used, allowing the Sensurround horns in the front and back of the theater to be controlled independently. This allowed for more creative effects, such as a sound being panned from front to back of the theater. Re-engineering the system was important to MCA because there were times during dialogue sequences when the sound mixers wanted the Sensurround running but did not want the dialogue to shift to the back of the theater. Having separate control of the front and back groups of Sensurround horns allowed this. The drivers in the Sensurround horns were improved to extend their frequency response higher so they could reproduce the low notes in music, thus allowing sound mixers to incorporate music into the Sensurround system (this was used to good effect in \"Rollercoaster\".) Advancements by RCA in optical soundtrack recording led MCA engineers to the realization that an optical track could reliably record and reproduce bass down to 10\u00a0Hz. As well, removal of the Academy equalization would allow the high frequency response to be extended upward by an additional octave. The addition of dbx Type-II noise reduction and its attendant increase in useful dynamic range created a high-fidelity sound from a conventional optical print. MCA called this re-engineering of the system \"Sensurround Mod-II\" and the market name of the system was changed from just \"Sensurround\" to the \"Sensurround Special Effects System\".\nUnlike the original version of Sensurround, Mod-II (and later, Mod-III) were only for use with mono optical soundtracks. Due to the use of dbx Type-II noise reduction, MCA eliminated the standard Academy Filter traditionally used on optical prints, thus giving Sensurround an increased frequency response of 16\u00a0Hz to 16\u00a0kHz and a dynamic range of 86\u00a0dB, superior to 70mm magnetic prints of the time. It also allowed a mono optical track to have surround sound effects and MCA began to market the system to other studios and producers as a truly high-fidelity sound and special effects system. &lt;a href=\"Dolby%20Stereo\"&gt;Dolby Stereo&lt;/a&gt; optical was just beginning to become known in the industry and MCA felt they had a viable competing format. While Warner Bros. and Paramount seriously considered adopting the system, in the end only Universal Studios ever released films using the process. Both Warner and Paramount later patented their own \"special effects\" systems to create Sensurround-type effects.\nSensurround Mod-III.\nMod-III Sensurround was a further refinement of the system to allow more control over level, timbre and placement of effects. Instead of a simple wide-range rumble that could be felt and heard, Mod-III used more narrow band extended low frequency effects in the 16\u201325\u00a0Hz range, in addition to the higher frequency program sounds and surround-sound effect. Thus, scenes could have dialogue and other audio at standard levels, plus the effect of movement from the infrasonic rumble, creating sensations that had not been possible in earlier Sensurround films. Mod-III Sensurround was used in &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Battlestar%20Galactica%20%281978%2C%201980%29%20episodes%23Feature%20length%20films\"&gt;\"Battlestar Galactica\"&lt;/a&gt; in 1978.\nSensurround was a highly successful theatrical sound system. By 1976, when \"&lt;a href=\"Midway%20%281976%20film%29\"&gt;Midway&lt;/a&gt;\" opened, there were over 800 theaters with Sensurround capability in the US. Worldwide, there were over 2000 Sensurround theaters. During the initial design of the system MCA figured it would be installed in a limited number of theaters across the US\u2014perhaps 30 in all\u2014and that smaller theaters, or theaters in small towns, would not want to bother with the installation or the loss of seating capacity necessitated by the large Sensurround horns. This was quickly disproved: \"Earthquake\" premiered with 17 Sensurround installations and by the end of its run over 400 theaters had shown the film in Sensurround. \"Midway\" opened with 300 Sensurround-equipped theaters. At first, MCA only rented Sensurround to theaters at a cost of $500 per week, but by the opening of \"Midway\", theaters could purchase the systems outright and MCA had begun to ship the Model-M horns to theaters un-assembled. Theater owners also had the option of purchasing only the Cerwin-Vega drivers and horn cabinet blueprints, buying the wood and making the horn cabinets themselves. MCA made these changes due to the success of the system and because the shipping costs of the heavy Sensurround horns were becoming very expensive.\nThroughout the history of the Sensurround program, RCA Technical Services performed the theater installations and maintenance. If repairs or replacements were required, the RCA technicians contacted MCA Systems to order needed parts. Because control tones were used to trigger the Sensurround horns, theaters could not generally use the system with their standard films unless a rewiring was done.\nHistory.\nAwards.\nIn 1974, Waldon O. Watson, Richard J. Stumpf, Robert J. Leonard and the Universal City Studios Sound Department received a special &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%2C%20Scientific%20or%20Technical\"&gt;Scientific and Engineering Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; for \"the development and engineering of the Sensurround System for motion picture presentation\". The film \"Earthquake\" also won an &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award\"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Sound\"&gt;Best Sound&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Pierce%20%28sound%20engineer%29\"&gt;Ronald Pierce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melvin%20M.%20Metcalfe%20Sr.\"&gt;Melvin M. Metcalfe Sr.&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn 1976, MCA was granted for the Sensurround system.\nDrawbacks.\nSensurround speakers involved expense for theater owners. Rental for speakers cost $500 a month in 1974 and their installation involved the removal of some seats. The extra expense was commercially justifiable as long as it appeared to provide an advantage in drawing audiences.\nSensurround made \"Earthquake\" a popular \"event\" film in 1974 and one of the year's highest-grossing films. Sensurround presented practical challenges, though, in &lt;a href=\"Multiplex%20%28movie%20theater%29\"&gt;multiplex cinemas&lt;/a&gt; where separate theater spaces shared walls. Audiences for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Godfather%20Part%20II\"&gt;The Godfather Part II&lt;/a&gt;\", which opened the same month (November 1974) as \"Earthquake\", often complained to theater managers about the Sensurround effect when \"Earthquake\" was shown in an adjoining theater. The low-frequency vibrations rattled tiles and plaster, too, leading to damage in some venues; a safety net was installed at &lt;a href=\"Grauman%27s%20Chinese%20Theatre\"&gt;Mann's Chinese Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; to catch errant pieces of plaster falling from the ceiling. When \"Earthquake\" was screened in Chicago, the head of the Chicago Building and Safety Department demanded that the system be turned down or removed to prevent damage to city theaters. In Germany, Sensurround movies could only be screened in single-screen houses. Subsequent Sensurround films, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Midway%20%281976%20film%29\"&gt;Midway&lt;/a&gt;\", also tended to play in single-screen cinemas.\nThe success of \"&lt;a href=\"Star%20Wars%20%28film%29\"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;\" over &lt;a href=\"Rollercoaster%20%281977%20film%29\"&gt;\"Rollercoaster\"&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of 1977 demonstrated to theater operators the limits of Sensurround as a guarantor of audience draw. \"Battlestar Galactica: &lt;a href=\"Saga%20of%20a%20Star%20World\"&gt;Saga of a Star World&lt;/a&gt;\" (1978) and \"Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack\" (1979) marked the final bows of Sensurround, though \"Alien\", a 20th Century Fox film, would see a limited release in 70mm Sensurround.\nCompeting processes.\nThe success of Sensurround as an effect led rival studios to develop their own audio enhancements. &lt;a href=\"20th%20Century%20Fox\"&gt;20th Century Fox&lt;/a&gt; released \"&lt;a href=\"Damnation%20Alley%20%28film%29\"&gt;Damnation Alley&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977) in (and mixed \"Alien\" in Sensurround following Sound 360's failure), and &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Brothers\"&gt;Warner Brothers&lt;/a&gt; employed their &lt;a href=\"Megasound\"&gt;Megasound&lt;/a&gt; process for \"&lt;a href=\"Altered%20States\"&gt;Altered States&lt;/a&gt;\" (1980), \"&lt;a href=\"Outland%20%28film%29\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;\" (1981), \"&lt;a href=\"Wolfen%20%28film%29\"&gt;Wolfen&lt;/a&gt;\" (1981) and \"&lt;a href=\"Superman%20II\"&gt;Superman II&lt;/a&gt;\" (1981).\nCultural references.\nOn their 1977 album \"&lt;a href=\"Never%20Mind%20The%20Bollocks%20Here%27s%20The%20Sex%20Pistols\"&gt;Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols&lt;/a&gt;\", the punk rock group the &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Pistols\"&gt;Sex Pistols&lt;/a&gt; referenced Sensurround in their song \"&lt;a href=\"Holidays%20in%20the%20Sun%20%28song%29\"&gt;Holidays in the Sun&lt;/a&gt;\" in the opening of the second verse (\"It's in Sensurround sound in a two inch wall, I was waiting for the communist call\").\nThe English &lt;a href=\"gothic%20rock\"&gt;gothic rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%20of%20Mercy\"&gt;The Sisters of Mercy&lt;/a&gt; reference Sensurround in the song \"Body Electric\" from their 1984 EP \"&lt;a href=\"Body%20and%20Soul%20%28EP%29\"&gt;Body and Soul&lt;/a&gt;\". (\"Through the cables and the underground now\nThe faceless breathless calls, This is Babel, Sensurround now, This place is death with walls\").\nThe alternative pop/rock band &lt;a href=\"They%20Might%20Be%20Giants\"&gt;They Might Be Giants&lt;/a&gt; released a song titled \"Sensurround\" that was incorporated in the soundtrack to \"\" and (in a different, faster-paced recording) their &lt;a href=\"Extended%20play\"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"S-E-X-X-Y\"&gt;S-E-X-X-Y&lt;/a&gt;\". The song makes several references to the innovation, especially as used in \"Earthquake\". \nAn early \"&lt;a href=\"FoxTrot\"&gt;FoxTrot&lt;/a&gt;\" comic has Jason presenting his dinosaur movie in Sensurround.\nIn the 1993 film \"&lt;a href=\"Matinee%20%281993%20film%29\"&gt;Matinee&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Mant!\", Matinee's film-within-a-film, was filmed in \"Rumble-Rama\", a not-so-subtle nod to Sensurround.\nThe alternative rock band &lt;a href=\"Manic%20Street%20Preachers\"&gt;Manic Street Preachers&lt;/a&gt; references Sensurround in the chorus of the song \"Small Black Flowers That Grow In The Sky\" (\"Want to get out, won't miss you Sensurround\") from the 1996 album &lt;a href=\"Everything%20Must%20Go%20%28Manic%20Street%20Preachers%20album%29\"&gt;Everything Must Go&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sensurround process is parodied in the 1979 film \"&lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Fried%20Movie\"&gt;Kentucky Fried Movie&lt;/a&gt;\" in a sketch in which the fictional film \"See You Next Wednesday\" is screened in \"Feel-Around\", whereby a uniformed usher touches the viewer in time with the action on the screen, including assaulting and kissing them.\nIn its 1981 anti-materialism song \"Elevator Muzik\", the &lt;a href=\"Resurrection%20Band\"&gt;Resurrection Band&lt;/a&gt; references the process in the lyric \"Elevating sales at the speed of sound, soon you'll be shopping in Sensurround\"."
