    "text": " \nThung Phaya Thai (, ) is a \"&lt;a href=\"khwaeng\"&gt;khwaeng&lt;/a&gt;\" (subdistrict) of &lt;a href=\"Ratchathewi\"&gt;Ratchathewi&lt;/a&gt; District, downtown &lt;a href=\"Bangkok\"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThis area formerly known as \"Thung Phaya Thai\", a vast field in the area of inner capital, it covers the area from the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Dusit%20Palace\"&gt;Dusit Palace&lt;/a&gt; next to the Thung Som Poi (now is the location of &lt;a href=\"Chitralada%20Royal%20Villa\"&gt;Chitralada Royal Villa&lt;/a&gt;) to the &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Monument%2C%20Bangkok\"&gt;Victory Monument&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phaya%20Thai%20Palace\"&gt;Phaya Thai Palace&lt;/a&gt; today. The next area was known as \"Thung Bang Kapi\" of &lt;a href=\"Bang%20Kapi\"&gt;Bang Kapi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Thonglang\"&gt;Wang Thonglang&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Huai%20Khwang\"&gt;Huai Khwang&lt;/a&gt; Districts in present day.\nAlthough it was an inner city area, but the atmosphere in the past, it was a rural &lt;a href=\"countryside\"&gt;countryside&lt;/a&gt; and fresh air. Khlong Phaya Thai, a \"&lt;a href=\"khlong\"&gt;khlong&lt;/a&gt;\" (canal) which was approximately two km (1.24\u00a0mi) long, flows through the area.\nTherefore, King &lt;a href=\"Rama%20V\"&gt;Rama V&lt;/a&gt; bought more than a thousand \"&lt;a href=\"rai%20%28unit%29\"&gt;rai&lt;/a&gt;\" (more than 395 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s) of land here. He ordered the construction of Phaya Thai Palace in 1910 along the banks of Khlong Samsen, as well as having to build a road connecting Hua Lamphong Road (now &lt;a href=\"Rama%20IV%20Road\"&gt;Rama IV Road&lt;/a&gt;), pass Pathum Wan Road (now &lt;a href=\"Rama%20I%20Road\"&gt;Rama I Road&lt;/a&gt;), parallel to Pra Chae Chin Road (now &lt;a href=\"Phetchaburi%20Road\"&gt;Phetchaburi Road&lt;/a&gt;), cuts across &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Line%20%28Thailand%29\"&gt;eastern railway line&lt;/a&gt; and Duang Tawan Road (now &lt;a href=\"Si%20Ayutthaya%20Road\"&gt;Si Ayutthaya Road&lt;/a&gt;), as far as ending at Pao Road (now &lt;a href=\"Phahonyothin%20Road\"&gt;Phahonyothin Road&lt;/a&gt;), called \"&lt;a href=\"Phaya%20Thai%20Road\"&gt;Phaya Thai Road&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe king and his wife, Queen &lt;a href=\"Saovabha%20Phongsri\"&gt;Saovabha Phongsri&lt;/a&gt; used the palace as a royal retreat, and the king used this place to test the cultivation as well.\nIn addition, in those days, this palace was also used as a place to hold up to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Ploughing%20Ceremony\"&gt;Royal Ploughing Ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, which was a ceremony that has existed since ancient times to give the morale to farmers in the beginning of the planting season. After King Rama V passed away in 1910, Queen Saovabha Phongsri used this place as a residence until she died in 1919.\nThis area was also residence to &lt;a href=\"Islam%20in%20Thailand\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;s as well.\nCurrently, although the fields have disappeared, Khlong Phaya Thai was filled in to allow the road to be built, until it became just a small waterway in &lt;a href=\"Phramongkutklao%20Hospital\"&gt;Phramongkutklao Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, but the name \"Thung Phaya Thai\" is still used for this area, and due to the numerous modifications of &lt;a href=\"Bangkok%20Metropolitan%20Administration\"&gt;Bangkok administration&lt;/a&gt; making Thung Phaya Thai become part of Ratchathewi District to the present.\nGeography.\nThe area is bordered by neighbouring subdistricts (from north clockwise): Phaya Thai and, Sam Sen Nai in &lt;a href=\"Phaya%20Thai%20District\"&gt;Phaya Thai&lt;/a&gt; District (Khlong Sam Sen is a borderline), &lt;a href=\"Makkasan\"&gt;Makkasan&lt;/a&gt;, and Thanon Phetchaburi in its district (Phaya Thai Road and Si Ayutthaya Road are the borderlines), &lt;a href=\"Suan%20Chitlada\"&gt;Suan Chitlada&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dusit%20District\"&gt;Dusit&lt;/a&gt; District (&lt;a href=\"Northern%20Line%20%28Thailand%29\"&gt;Northern Railway Line&lt;/a&gt; is a borderline)."
