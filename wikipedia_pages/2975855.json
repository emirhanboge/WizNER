    "text": "SS \"Persia\" was a &lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20and%20Oriental%20Steam%20Navigation%20Company\"&gt;P&amp;O&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"passenger%20liner\"&gt;passenger liner&lt;/a&gt;, built in 1900 by &lt;a href=\"Caird%20%26amp%3B%20Company\"&gt;Caird &amp; Company&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Inverclyde\"&gt;Inverclyde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greenock\"&gt;Greenock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. It was torpedoed and sunk without warning on 30 December 1915, by German &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; .\nHistory.\nIt was long, with a &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of , &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28ship%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of and a size of , \"Persia\" carried &lt;a href=\"Steam%20engine%23Multiple%20expansion%20engines\"&gt;triple expansion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"steam%20engine\"&gt;steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s capable of driving the ship at .\n\"Persia\" was sunk off &lt;a href=\"Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt;, while the passengers were having lunch, on 30 December 1915, by German &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; U-boat ace &lt;a href=\"Max%20Valentiner\"&gt;Max Valentiner&lt;/a&gt; (commanding ). \"Persia\" sank in five to ten minutes, killing 343 of the 519 aboard. One reason for the large number of casualties was that only four of the lifeboats were successfully launched because of the list to port. The sinking was highly controversial, as it was argued that it broke naval international law that stated that merchant ships carrying a neutral flag could be stopped and searched for contraband but not sunk unless the passengers and crew were put in a place of safety (for which lifeboats on the open sea were not sufficient). The \"Persia\" was a British ship presenting itself openly to another belligerent. The U-boat fired a &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; and made no provision for any survivors, under Germany's policy of &lt;a href=\"unrestricted%20submarine%20warfare\"&gt;unrestricted submarine warfare&lt;/a&gt; but against the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20German%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial German Navy&lt;/a&gt;'s own restriction on attacking passenger liners, the &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20pledge\"&gt;\"Arabic\" pledge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of sinking, \"Persia\" was carrying a large quantity of gold and jewels belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Maharaja%20Jagatjit%20Singh\"&gt;Maharaja Jagatjit Singh&lt;/a&gt;, though he himself had disembarked at &lt;a href=\"Marseilles\"&gt;Marseilles&lt;/a&gt;. Among the passengers to survive were &lt;a href=\"Walter%20E.%20Smith%20%28British%20politician%29\"&gt;Walter E. Smith&lt;/a&gt;, a British Member of Parliament, Colonel Charles Clive Bigham, son of &lt;a href=\"John%20Bigham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Mersey\"&gt;Lord Mersey&lt;/a&gt;, 2nd Lieutenant John Lionell Miller-Hallett of the Gurkha Rifles, and &lt;a href=\"John%20Douglas-Scott-Montagu%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Montagu%20of%20Beaulieu\"&gt;John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu&lt;/a&gt;. His secretary and mistress &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20Thornton\"&gt;Eleanor Thornton&lt;/a&gt;, who many believe was the model for the &lt;a href=\"Rolls-Royce%20%28car%29\"&gt;Rolls-Royce&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Ecstasy\"&gt;Spirit of Ecstasy&lt;/a&gt;\" mascot by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Sykes%20%28sculptor%29\"&gt;Charles Sykes&lt;/a&gt;, died. Also among the dead were &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Ney%20McNeely\"&gt;Robert Ney McNeely&lt;/a&gt;, American Consul at &lt;a href=\"Aden\"&gt;Aden&lt;/a&gt; and a former North Carolina state senator from Union County, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Vane%20Russell\"&gt;Robert Vane Russell&lt;/a&gt;, American missionary Rev. &lt;a href=\"Homer%20Russell%20Salisbury\"&gt;Homer Russell Salisbury&lt;/a&gt; and Frank Morris Coleman, the co-owner of &lt;a href=\"Bennett%2C%20Coleman%20%26amp%3B%20Co.%20Ltd.\"&gt;Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;\nThe survivors on the four lifeboats were picked up during the second night after the sinking by the minesweeper . Only 15 of the women on board survived, among them British actress &lt;a href=\"Ann%20Codrington\"&gt;Ann Codrington&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Rossiter%20Case\"&gt;The Rossiter Case&lt;/a&gt;\"), who was pregnant with her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Hilliard%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Patricia Hilliard&lt;/a&gt;. Ann lost her mother, Mrs. Helen Codrington.\nSixty-seven crewmen from the then &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; colony of &lt;a href=\"Goa\"&gt;Goa&lt;/a&gt; perished. Most of them were stewards.\nThe sinking was front-page news on many British newspapers, including the \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Mirror\"&gt;Daily Mirror&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Sketch\"&gt;Daily Sketch&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe wreck of \"Persia\" was located off Crete in 2003 at a depth of , and an attempt was made to salvage the treasure located in the bullion room. The salvage attempt met with limited success, retrieving artifacts and portions of the ship, and some jewels from the bullion room. Some of the gems have since been made into commemorative jewellery."
