    "text": "This is a list of the bird species recorded in Mozambique. The avifauna of &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; include a total of 784 species, of which 4 have been &lt;a href=\"Introduced%20species\"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; by humans.\nThis list's &lt;a href=\"Taxonomy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;taxonomic&lt;/a&gt; treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Clements%20Checklist%20of%20Birds%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World&lt;/a&gt;\", 2021 edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Mozambique.\nThe following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species.\nOstriches.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Struthioniformes\"&gt;Struthioniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Struthionidae\"&gt;Struthionidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds.\nDucks, geese, and waterfowl.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Anseriformes\"&gt;Anseriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Anatidae\"&gt;Anatidae&lt;/a&gt;\nAnatidae includes the &lt;a href=\"duck\"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt;s and most duck-like waterfowl, such as &lt;a href=\"Goose\"&gt;geese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"swan\"&gt;swan&lt;/a&gt;s. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.\nGuineafowl.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Galliformes\"&gt;Galliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Numididae\"&gt;Numididae&lt;/a&gt;\nGuineafowl are a group of African, seed-eating, ground-nesting birds that resemble partridges, but with featherless heads and spangled grey plumage.\nPheasants, grouse, and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Galliformes\"&gt;Galliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phasianidae\"&gt;Phasianidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Phasianidae are a family of terrestrial birds which consists of &lt;a href=\"quail\"&gt;quail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"partridge\"&gt;partridge&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snowcock\"&gt;snowcock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"francolin\"&gt;francolin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Pternistis\"&gt;spurfowl&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tragopan\"&gt;tragopan&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"monal\"&gt;monal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pheasant\"&gt;pheasant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"peafowl\"&gt;peafowl&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"jungle%20fowl\"&gt;jungle fowl&lt;/a&gt;s. In general, they are plump (although they vary in size) and have broad, relatively short wings.\nFlamingos.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Phoenicopteriformes\"&gt;Phoenicopteriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phoenicopteridae\"&gt;Phoenicopteridae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Flamingo\"&gt;Flamingo&lt;/a&gt;s are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down. \nGrebes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Podicipediformes\"&gt;Podicipediformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Podicipedidae\"&gt;Podicipedidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grebe\"&gt;Grebe&lt;/a&gt;s are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.\nPigeons and doves.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Columbiformes\"&gt;Columbiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Columbidae\"&gt;Columbidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pigeon\"&gt;Pigeon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dove\"&gt;dove&lt;/a&gt;s are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy &lt;a href=\"cere\"&gt;cere&lt;/a&gt;.\nSandgrouse.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pterocliformes\"&gt;Pterocliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Pteroclidae\"&gt;Pteroclidae&lt;/a&gt;\nSandgrouse have small, pigeon like heads and necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and sometimes tails and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes at dawn and dusk. Their legs are feathered down to the toes. \nBustards.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Otidiformes\"&gt;Otidiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Otididae\"&gt;Otididae&lt;/a&gt;\nBustards are large terrestrial birds mainly associated with dry open country and steppes in the Old World. They are omnivorous and nest on the ground. They walk steadily on strong legs and big toes, pecking for food as they go. They have long broad wings with \"fingered\" wingtips and striking patterns in flight. Many have interesting mating displays.\nTuracos.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Musophagiformes\"&gt;Musophagiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Musophagidae\"&gt;Musophagidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe turacos, plantain eaters and go-away-birds make up the bird family Musophagidae. They are medium-sized arboreal birds. The turacos and plantain eaters are brightly coloured, usually in blue, green or purple. The go-away birds are mostly grey and white. \nCuckoos.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Cuculiformes\"&gt;Cuculiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Cuculidae\"&gt;Cuculidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Cuculidae includes &lt;a href=\"cuckoo\"&gt;cuckoo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Geococcyx\"&gt;roadrunner&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ani%20%28bird%29\"&gt;anis&lt;/a&gt;. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails and strong legs. The Old World cuckoos are &lt;a href=\"brood%20parasite\"&gt;brood parasite&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNightjars and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgiformes\"&gt;Caprimulgiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgidae\"&gt;Caprimulgidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Nightjar\"&gt;Nightjar&lt;/a&gt;s are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves.\nSwifts.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgiformes\"&gt;Caprimulgiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Apodidae\"&gt;Apodidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Swift%20%28bird%29\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;s are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. \nFlufftails.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Sarothruridae\"&gt;Sarothruridae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe flufftails are a small family of ground-dwelling birds found only in Madagascar and sub-Saharan Africa.\nRails, gallinules, and coots.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Rallidae\"&gt;Rallidae&lt;/a&gt;\nRallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the &lt;a href=\"Rail%20%28bird%29\"&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crake\"&gt;crake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coot\"&gt;coot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Rallidae\"&gt;gallinule&lt;/a&gt;s. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. \nFinfoots.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Heliornithidae\"&gt;Heliornithidae&lt;/a&gt;\nHeliornithidae is a small family of tropical birds with webbed lobes on their feet similar to those of grebes and coots. \nCranes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Gruidae\"&gt;Gruidae&lt;/a&gt;\nCranes are large, long-legged and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or \"dances\".\nThick-knees.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Burhinidae\"&gt;Burhinidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe thick-knees are a group of largely tropical waders in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats. \nStilts and avocets.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Recurvirostridae\"&gt;Recurvirostridae&lt;/a&gt;\nRecurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds, which includes the &lt;a href=\"avocet\"&gt;avocet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stilt\"&gt;stilt&lt;/a&gt;s. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills.\nOystercatchers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Haematopodidae\"&gt;Haematopodidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"oystercatcher\"&gt;oystercatcher&lt;/a&gt;s are large and noisy &lt;a href=\"plover\"&gt;plover&lt;/a&gt;-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prising open &lt;a href=\"mollusc\"&gt;mollusc&lt;/a&gt;s. \nPlovers and lapwings.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Charadriidae\"&gt;Charadriidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Charadriidae includes the &lt;a href=\"plover\"&gt;plover&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dotterel\"&gt;dotterel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"lapwing\"&gt;lapwing&lt;/a&gt;s. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water. \nPainted-snipes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Rostratulidae\"&gt;Rostratulidae&lt;/a&gt;\nPainted-snipes are short-legged, long-billed birds similar in shape to the true snipes, but more brightly coloured.\nJacanas.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Jacanidae\"&gt;Jacanidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe jacanas are a group of tropical waders in the family Jacanidae. They are found throughout the tropics. They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat.\nSandpipers and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Scolopacidae\"&gt;Scolopacidae&lt;/a&gt;\nScolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the &lt;a href=\"sandpiper\"&gt;sandpiper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"curlew\"&gt;curlew&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"godwit\"&gt;godwit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tringa\"&gt;shanks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tattler%20%28bird%29\"&gt;tattler&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"woodcock\"&gt;woodcock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snipe\"&gt;snipe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dowitcher\"&gt;dowitcher&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"phalarope\"&gt;phalarope&lt;/a&gt;s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. \nButtonquails.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Turnicidae\"&gt;Turnicidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe buttonquails are small, drab, running birds which resemble the true quails. The female is the brighter of the sexes and initiates courtship. The male incubates the eggs and tends the young.\nCrab-plover.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Dromadidae\"&gt;Dromadidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe crab-plover is related to the waders. It resembles a plover but with very long grey legs and a strong heavy black bill similar to a tern. It has black-and-white plumage, a long neck, partially webbed feet and a bill designed for eating crabs.\nPratincoles and coursers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Glareolidae\"&gt;Glareolidae&lt;/a&gt;\nGlareolidae is a family of wading birds comprising the &lt;a href=\"pratincole\"&gt;pratincole&lt;/a&gt;s, which have short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails, and the &lt;a href=\"courser\"&gt;courser&lt;/a&gt;s, which have long legs, short wings and long, pointed bills which curve downwards.\nSkuas and jaegers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Stercorariidae\"&gt;Stercorariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Stercorariidae are, in general, medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They nest on the ground in temperate and arctic regions and are long-distance migrants.\nGulls, terns, and skimmers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Laridae\"&gt;Laridae&lt;/a&gt;\nLaridae is a family of medium to large &lt;a href=\"seabird\"&gt;seabird&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"gull\"&gt;gull&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tern\"&gt;tern&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Skimmer%20%28bird%29\"&gt;skimmer&lt;/a&gt;s. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish.\nTropicbirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Phaethontiformes\"&gt;Phaethontiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phaethontidae\"&gt;Phaethontidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tropicbird\"&gt;Tropicbird&lt;/a&gt;s are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.\nPenguins.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Sphenisciformes\"&gt;Sphenisciformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Spheniscidae\"&gt;Spheniscidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe penguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. Most penguins feed on &lt;a href=\"krill\"&gt;krill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater.\nAlbatrosses.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Diomedeidae\"&gt;Diomedeidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses from the genus \"Diomedea\" have the largest wingspans of any extant birds. \nSouthern storm-petrels.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Oceanitidae\"&gt;Oceanitidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe southern storm-petrels are relatives of the &lt;a href=\"petrel\"&gt;petrel&lt;/a&gt;s and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on &lt;a href=\"plankton\"&gt;plankton&lt;/a&gt;ic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;-like.\nNorthern storm-petrels.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Hydrobatidae\"&gt;Hydrobatidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThough the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family.\nShearwaters and petrels.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Procellariidae\"&gt;Procellariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \"true petrels\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.\nStorks.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Ciconiiformes\"&gt;Ciconiiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Ciconiidae\"&gt;Ciconiidae&lt;/a&gt;\nStorks are large, long-legged, long-necked, wading birds with long, stout bills. Storks are mute, but bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory. \nFrigatebirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Fregatidae\"&gt;Fregatidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Frigatebird\"&gt;Frigatebird&lt;/a&gt;s are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.\nBoobies and gannets.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Sulidae\"&gt;Sulidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe sulids comprise the &lt;a href=\"gannet\"&gt;gannet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Booby\"&gt;boobies&lt;/a&gt;. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.\nAnhingas.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Anhingidae\"&gt;Anhingidae&lt;/a&gt;\nAnhingas or darters are often called \"snake-birds\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving.\nCormorants and shags.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phalacrocoracidae\"&gt;Phalacrocoracidae&lt;/a&gt;\nPhalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful.\nPelicans.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pelecaniformes\"&gt;Pelecaniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Pelecanidae\"&gt;Pelecanidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pelican\"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;s are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes.\nHammerkop.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pelecaniformes\"&gt;Pelecaniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Scopidae\"&gt;Scopidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe hammerkop is a medium-sized bird with a long shaggy crest. The shape of its head with a curved bill and crest at the back is reminiscent of a hammer, hence its name. Its plumage is drab-brown all over.\nHerons, egrets, and bitterns.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pelecaniformes\"&gt;Pelecaniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Ardeidae\"&gt;Ardeidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Ardeidae contains the &lt;a href=\"bittern\"&gt;bittern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;heron&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"egret\"&gt;egret&lt;/a&gt;s. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.\nIbises and spoonbills.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pelecaniformes\"&gt;Pelecaniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Threskiornithidae\"&gt;Threskiornithidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThreskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the &lt;a href=\"ibis\"&gt;ibis&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"spoonbill\"&gt;spoonbill&lt;/a&gt;s. They have long, broad wings with 11 primary and about 20 secondary feathers. They are strong fliers and despite their size and weight, very capable soarers.\nSecretarybird.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Accipitriformes\"&gt;Accipitriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Sagittariidae\"&gt;Sagittariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe secretarybird is a bird of prey in the order &lt;a href=\"Accipitriformes\"&gt;Accipitriformes&lt;/a&gt; but is easily distinguished from other raptors by its long crane-like legs.\nOsprey.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Accipitriformes\"&gt;Accipitriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Pandionidae\"&gt;Pandionidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Pandionidae contains only one species, the osprey.

These birds have powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons and keen eyesight.\nBarn-owls.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Strigiformes\"&gt;Strigiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Tytonidae\"&gt;Tytonidae&lt;/a&gt;\nBarn-owls are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart-shaped faces. They have long strong legs with powerful talons.\nOwls.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Strigiformes\"&gt;Strigiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Strigidae\"&gt;Strigidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"typical%20owl\"&gt;typical owl&lt;/a&gt;s are small to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large forward-facing eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak and a conspicuous circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk.\nMousebirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Coliiformes\"&gt;Coliiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Coliidae\"&gt;Coliidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe mousebirds are slender greyish or brown birds with soft, hairlike body feathers and very long thin tails. They are arboreal and scurry through the leaves like rodents in search of berries, fruit and buds. They are acrobatic and can feed upside down. All species have strong claws and reversible outer toes. They also have crests and stubby bills. \nTrogons.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Trogoniformes\"&gt;Trogoniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Trogonidae\"&gt;Trogonidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Trogonidae includes trogons and quetzals. Found in tropical woodlands worldwide, they feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance.
