    "text": "Eugen Levin\u00e9 () (10 May 1883 \u2013 5 June 1919), AKA \"Dr. Eugen Levin\u00e9,\" was a &lt;a href=\"German%20people\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; revolutionary and one of the leaders of the short-lived Second &lt;a href=\"Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic\"&gt;Bavarian Soviet Republic&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nEugen Levin\u00e9 was born on May 10, 1883, in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; into the rich &lt;a href=\"Jewish\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; merchant family Julius and Rozalia (n\u00e9e Goldberg). Julius Levin\u00e9 died when Eugen was three years old, and Rozalia emigrated to &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; with her son, settling in &lt;a href=\"Wiesbaden\"&gt;Wiesbaden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mannheim\"&gt;Mannheim&lt;/a&gt;. Eugen went on to study law at the &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg%20University\"&gt;Heidelberg University&lt;/a&gt;. While a student there, he remained in touch with Russia.\nCareer.\n1905 revolution.\nLevin\u00e9 returned to Russia to participate in the failed &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution%20of%201905\"&gt;revolution of 1905&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Tsar\"&gt;Tsar&lt;/a&gt;. For his actions, he was exiled to &lt;a href=\"Siberia\"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;. He eventually escaped to Germany and began studying at &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg%20University\"&gt;Heidelberg University&lt;/a&gt; and married in 1915. For a short time, he served in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20German%20Army\"&gt;Imperial German Army&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;. \n1919 Bavarian Soviet Republic.\nAfter the war ended, Levin\u00e9 joined the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Communist Party of Germany&lt;/a&gt; (KPD), which, under &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Levi\"&gt;Paul Levi&lt;/a&gt;, who sent first &lt;a href=\"Max%20Levien\"&gt;Max Levien&lt;/a&gt; in December 1918 and then Levin\u00e9, first to &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Silesia\"&gt;Upper Silesia&lt;/a&gt; to quell an uprising and then in March 1918 to Munich to organize the KPD locally and help to create a &lt;a href=\"Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic\"&gt;socialist republic in Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;. Neither Lieven or Levin\u00e9 had much revolutionary experience. The republic lasted only several weeks, replaced quickly by a &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20republic%20%28system%20of%20government%29\"&gt;Soviet-style republic&lt;/a&gt; after the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Eisner\"&gt;Kurt Eisner&lt;/a&gt;, then leader of the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany&lt;/a&gt; (USPD). \nThe ruling government of the new republic lasted only six days, due to poor leadership under the German-Jewish playwright &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Toller\"&gt;Ernst Toller&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoup.\nOn April 13, 1919, a \"Red Army,\" led by Levin\u00e9 and without KPD orders or approval, won clashes with the Toller's soldiers, created a second soviet republic with Levin\u00e9 at its head, who then received approval and support directly from &lt;a href=\"Lenin\"&gt;Lenin&lt;/a&gt;.\nLevin\u00e9 attempted to expropriate luxurious flats to the homeless and seize factories and place them under workers control, He also planned to remove teaching of history from education, and to abolish &lt;a href=\"Banknote\"&gt;paper money&lt;/a&gt;, neither of which he completed. He introduced censorship and a \"military-style\" government, while also revamping education and declaring the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20Frauenkirche\"&gt;Munich Frauenkirche&lt;/a&gt; a revolutionary temple. These actions followed inquiries from Lenin as to whether Levin\u00e9 had assumed control of banks and taken bourgeois hostages.\nUnder orders from Levin\u00e9, Red Guards began rounding up people they considered to be hostile to the new regime as hostages against imminent outside attack.\nOn April 27, 1919, Levin\u00e9 stepped down (\"abdicated\") as leader of the Soviet.\nAs the German president &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Ebert\"&gt;Friedrich Ebert&lt;/a&gt; gave orders to subdue the Bavarian Soviet Republic and reinstate the Bavarian government under &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Hoffmann%20%28SPD%29\"&gt;Johannes Hoffmann&lt;/a&gt;, the Red Guards executed eight hostages on April 29, 1919. \nCountercoup, arrest, trial.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Reichswehr\"&gt;German Army&lt;/a&gt;, assisted by &lt;a href=\"Freikorps\"&gt;Freikorps&lt;/a&gt;, with a force of roughly 39,000 men invaded and quickly conquered Munich on 3 May 1919 in a \"White Terror.\" Levin\u00e9 personally took part in the street fighting against them. In retaliation for the execution of the hostages, the Freikorps captured and killed some 700 men and women. Levin\u00e9 evaded arrest at first, perhaps by hiding in the apartment of Erich Katzenstein. After Levin\u00e9 was caught on May 19, 1919 (or arrested on May 13, 1919).). Public interest in his trial was high. On May 19, 1919, &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Einstein\"&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt; sent a joint telegram asking the courts to delay Levin\u00e9's trial. Levin\u00e9 was tried along with Toller in early June 1919; &lt;a href=\"Max%20Hirschberg\"&gt;Max Hirschberg&lt;/a&gt; refused to serve as his legal counsel, but Anton Graf von Pestalozza accepted. On Jun 3, 1919, the courts, calling him a \"foreign interloper in Bavaria,\" sentenced Levin\u00e9 to death by execution. Soldiers, bureaucrats, and members of the public passed by to see the \"blood-thirsty &lt;a href=\"Robespierre\"&gt;Robespierre&lt;/a&gt;\" while he awaited execution, his wife later reported.\nSpeech.\nLevin\u00e9 gave an inspiring speech during his trial. Its words included: We Communists are all dead men on leave. Of this I am fully aware. I do not know if you will extend my leave or whether I shall have to join &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Liebknecht\"&gt;Karl Liebknecht&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rosa%20Luxemburg\"&gt;Rosa Luxemburg&lt;/a&gt;. In any case I await your verdict with composure and inner serenity. For I know that, whatever your verdict, events cannot be stopped.\nAftermath.\nIn reaction to the two Bavarian socialist republics, whose leaders included many Jews, Bavaria, which was already conservative and anti-Semitic, became even more so. One of the people affected was &lt;a href=\"Reiner%20Maria%20Rilke\"&gt;Reiner Maria Rilke&lt;/a&gt;, who left Munich after soldiers ransacked his apartment.\nPersonal life and death.\nIn 1915, Levin\u00e9 married Rosa Broido (from the Polish town of &lt;a href=\"Gr%C3%B3dek%2C%20Bia%C5%82ystok%20County\"&gt;Gr\u00f3dek&lt;/a&gt;), who married &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Meyer%20%28German%20politician%29\"&gt;Ernst Meyer&lt;/a&gt; (1887-1930) and so became known as Meyer-Levin\u00e9, and then fled Germany when Hitler came to power and live the rest of her life in London (1890-1979). The Levin\u00e9s had at least one child, a son, whom they named Eugen. \nStephen Eric Bronner considers Levin\u00e9 a follower of &lt;a href=\"Rosa%20Luxemburg\"&gt;Rosa Luxemburg&lt;/a&gt; (for seeking \"to provide a legacy for the next generation,\" knowing \"the soviet was doomed\") and characterized him as follows: He incarnated the best of the Bolshevik spirit. He was unyielding and dogmatic, but an honest intellectual and totally committed to the most radical utopian ideals of international revolution... [and] aldo exhibited exceptional bravery.\" Levin\u00e9 was arrested and shot, age 36, on June 5 (or 6), 1919, by firing squad in &lt;a href=\"Stadelheim%20Prison\"&gt;Stadelheim Prison&lt;/a&gt;. Lawyer von Pestalozza arranged a Jewish funeral for the Marxist revolutionary.\nInfluence.\nMax Hirshberg remembered Levin\u00e9 as \"far superior\" to Levien \"in learning and spiritual purpose\" but believed both had committed blindly to the \"correctness of Russian methods.\"\nIn 1948, American ex-Soviet agent and later &lt;a href=\"anti-communist\"&gt;anti-communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Whittaker%20Chambers\"&gt;Whittaker Chambers&lt;/a&gt; cited Levin\u00e9 as one of three men who inspired him to join the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20USA\"&gt;Communist Party USA&lt;/a&gt; during testimony before the &lt;a href=\"House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee\"&gt;House Un-American Activities Committee&lt;/a&gt;, quoted in his 1952 memoir: Then I said: \"When I was a Communist, I had three heroes. One was a Russian. One was a Pole. One was a German Jew.. \"The German Jew was Eugen Levine. He was a Communist. During the Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919, Levine was the organizer of the Workers and Soldiers Soviets. When the Bavarian Soviet Republic was crushed, Levine was captured and courtmartialed. The court-martial told him: 'You are under sentence of death.' Levine answered: 'We Communists are always under sentence of death.'\" In 2017, Michael L\u00f6wy placed Levin\u00e9 in a group of Jewish libertarians including Hans K\u00f6hn, Rudolph Kayser, and &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Unger\"&gt;Erich Unger&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Toller and &lt;a href=\"Manes%20Sperber\"&gt;Manes Sperber&lt;/a&gt;."
