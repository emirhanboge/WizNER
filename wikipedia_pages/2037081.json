    "text": "Sesbania drummondii, known as poisonbean, rattlebox and rattlebush, is a medium-sized &lt;a href=\"Perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; shrub in the &lt;a href=\"legume\"&gt;legume&lt;/a&gt; family &lt;a href=\"Fabaceae\"&gt;Fabaceae&lt;/a&gt;. It is native to the &lt;a href=\"southeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;southeastern United States&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; east to &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese woody-based shrubs grow from tall. It is usually much branched in the upper portion. Branches are thin and widely spreading. The medium green &lt;a href=\"Leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are alternate, deciduous, and pinnately compound. There are typically 12-24 &lt;a href=\"leaflet%20%28botany%29\"&gt;leaflets&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally as many as 60 are found. Each leaflet is oblong shaped and long. The orange-yellow, pea-like &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s occur in a drooping &lt;a href=\"raceme\"&gt;raceme&lt;/a&gt; on a long stem. They are often found with red lining. The seed pods are four-sided, four-winged, and about long. The peas rattle inside, giving this plant its common name of Rattlebush. Inside the pods, the &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s are separated by transverse partitions.\nThese plants flower from May to October, usually retaining many of the seed pods, which remain attached until the plant dies back to ground level for the winter.\nThis plant prefers moist &lt;a href=\"soil\"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt;s of ditches and frequently-inundated meadows, as well as depressions and the open edges of lakes, ponds and streams.\nThe seeds are &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;ous, containing the toxin &lt;a href=\"sesbanimide\"&gt;sesbanimide&lt;/a&gt;. Animals raised with the plant learn to avoid it because of the foul taste of the green and flowering plants. However, naive &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; placed on pastures containing dried plants in late fall and winter are frequently poisoned. Sick animals often die within 24 hours.\nThis species is named in honor of the Scottish-born naturalist &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29\"&gt;Thomas Drummond&lt;/a&gt; (1793-1835). Other common names include sennabean and Drummond sesbania."
