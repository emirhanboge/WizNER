The system entered production in 2013.\nThe Ya Zahra differs from Iran's &lt;a href=\"Raad%20Air%20Defense%20System\"&gt;Raad&lt;/a&gt; in being a short-range air defense system. Iranian sources say it is able to form a missile defense network. This system was successfully tested in \"Defenders of Velayat Skies 4\" air defense drills. Iranian sources claim the Ya Zahra is more advanced than the French Crotale.\nMass production of the Ya Zahra air defense system officially began on January 27, 2013.\nThe 3rd generation of the Ya Zahra system, Ya Zahra-3, has electo-optical equipment that reportedly help to detect and track targets when battlefield is affected by heavy jamming. Also Ya Zahra has a full mobile version named Herz-e-Nohom.\nThe missile used by the system is the &lt;a href=\"Shahab-e-Saqeb%20%28missile%29\"&gt;Shahab Thaqeb&lt;/a&gt;. It has been under development since at least 2011."
