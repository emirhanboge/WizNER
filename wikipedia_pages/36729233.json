    "text": "Asocia\u021bia Club Sportiv Poli Timi\u0219oara (), commonly known as ACS Poli Timi\u0219oara, Poli Timi\u0219oara or simply ACS Poli, was a Romanian professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Club%20%28organization%29\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt; based in the city of &lt;a href=\"Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Timi%C8%99%20County\"&gt;Timi\u0219 County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe team was founded in 2012, the year the old &lt;a href=\"FC%20Politehnica%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; went bankrupt. &lt;a href=\"ACS%20Reca%C8%99\"&gt;ACS Reca\u0219&lt;/a&gt; was moved to Timi\u0219oara and\u2014supported by the City Council of Timi\u0219oara and the Timi\u0219 County Council\u2014was meant to continue the history of the original entity. It promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;top flight&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2013\u201314 season&lt;/a&gt;, however attendances were modest as the majority of the former fans chose to support &lt;a href=\"SSU%20Politehnica%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;ASU Politehnica Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; instead. The &lt;a href=\"Politehnica%20University%20of%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;Polytechnic University of Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; ceased the FC Politehnica brand and records for &lt;a href=\"Free%20content\"&gt;free use&lt;/a&gt; to ACS Poli between 2012 and 2021, but then moved them to ASU Politehnica during the latter year. Also in 2021, ACS Poli was excluded from the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20III\"&gt;Liga III&lt;/a&gt; championship and dissolved.\nACS Poli Timi\u0219oara played in white and purple kits, although it also used variations of black and white during its first years of existence.\nHistory.\nIn the summer of 2012, &lt;a href=\"ACS%20Reca%C8%99\"&gt;ACS Reca\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, a club just promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Liga II&lt;/a&gt;, was moved to &lt;a href=\"Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; and renamed \"ACS Poli Timi\u0219oara\" after the dissolution of &lt;a href=\"FC%20Politehnica%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt;. The new club is co-owned by the City Council and the County Council and has the backing of the Politehnica University of Timi\u0219oara, all three being active members in the legal entity running the club. However, the ultras supporters rejected the move and decided to support an alternative project in the lower leagues, &lt;a href=\"ASU%20Politehnica%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;ASU Politehnica Timi\u015foara&lt;/a&gt;.\nValentin Velcea continued as head coach, while the roster consisted mostly of the core ACS Reca\u0219 players and several players from FC Politehnica. At its conception, the club, established as an &lt;a href=\"Non-governmental%20organization\"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;, was primarily financed by the local authorities, as Timi\u0219oara mayor Nicolae Robu insisted control should not be forfeited to private investors. After initially playing in black/white/yellow kits, in order to avoid legal complications while the court ruled over the rightful owner following the bankruptcy of FC Politehnica, the club returned to its historic white-purple colors starting with the &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2015\u20132016&lt;/a&gt; season. As of February 2016, ACS Poli Timi\u015foara is the sole and full owner of all the rights pertaining to and deriving from the Politehnica Timi\u0219oara brand and records, following a court decision which nullified the original agreement between the founding club and record holders, and Marian Iancu's insolvent club.\nFrom a competitive perspective, the club failed to equal the achievements of the Marian Iancu era. A yo-yo-ing between the first two leagues, reminiscent of the Politehnica's travails in the 1980s, ensued. The situation was amplified by the fact that the financing received from the local authorities was deemed illegal in the summer of 2015, which left the club without its main financial benefactor. The highlight season for the new Poli came about in &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2016\u20132017&lt;/a&gt;, when the club started with a 14 points penalty, as it failed to reach a points minimum the previous year and recorded unpaid debts. In spite of this, Poli, under the management of &lt;a href=\"Ionu%C8%9B%20Popa\"&gt;Ionu\u0163 Popa&lt;/a&gt;, rallied to reach the relegation play-off in the dying minutes of the season and defeated rivals UTA Arad 5\u20132 on aggregate. Moreover, the club reached the first national cup final, finishing runner-up in the &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Cupa%20Ligii\"&gt;Cupa Ligii&lt;/a&gt;, while also reaching the semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Cupa%20Rom%C3%A2niei\"&gt;Romanian Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following season was another struggle and Poli suffered a reversal of fortunes as they were relegated by courtesy of a goal scored late in the last matchday. With financial pressures mounting, the club declared insolvency during the 2018\u20132019 Liga 2 season and struggled to stay competitive, becoming involved in another fight to avoid relegation. In order to mitigate costs, it was also forced to relocate from the Dan P\u0103ltini\u015fanu stadium to the &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Electrica\"&gt;Electrica&lt;/a&gt; stadium.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Romanian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; announced ahead of the start of the &lt;a href=\"2021%E2%80%9322%20Liga%20II\"&gt;2021\u201322 Liga II&lt;/a&gt; championship that the Polytechnic University of Timi\u0219oara, the owner of the logo, history and all of Politehnica Timi\u0219oara's football records, approves the use of these by &lt;a href=\"SSU%20Politehnica%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;SSU Politehnica Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt;. ACS Poli was also excluded from the third division and went bankrupt in September 2021.\nSupporters and Rivalries.\nHistorically, Poli has been the most prominent football club in Timi\u0219oara after 1945, playing consistently in either the first or the second tier of Romanian football. Local rivalries with &lt;a href=\"FC%20CFR%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;CFR Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CSP%20UM%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;UM Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; were relevant until the early 2000s. Afterwards, the former was relegated to a semi-professional status in the lower leagues and the latter was dissolved in 2008.\nNationally, there were strong rivalries with &lt;a href=\"FC%20UTA%20Arad\"&gt;UTA Arad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;. The matches against UTA were labeled as the &lt;a href=\"West%20Derby%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;West Derby&lt;/a&gt;, due to the proximity of Timi\u0219oara and Arad. Matches against &lt;a href=\"CFR%20Cluj\"&gt;CFR Cluj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;FCSB&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"CS%20Universitatea%20Craiova\"&gt;Universitatea Craiova&lt;/a&gt; also drew large crowds.\nAfter the club reincarnated as ACS Poli in 2012, the core factions of the ultras movement decided to support an alternate club in the lower leagues, &lt;a href=\"ASU%20Politehnica%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;ASU Politehnica Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt;. ACS Poli struggled to fill the void created by their departure, with smaller fan factions forming to support the club. Although top-bill matches with historic rivals still attract fans to the stadium, attendances have dropped compared to the averages attained in the 2000s.\nStadia.\nThe club's home ground was &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Electrica\"&gt;Electrica&lt;/a&gt; stadium, although most of its history it played on &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Dan%20P%C4%83ltini%C8%99anu\"&gt;Dan P\u0103ltini\u0219anu Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable former players.\nThe footballers enlisted below have had international cap(s) for their respective countries at junior and/or senior level and/or more than 50 caps for ACS Poli Timi\u0219oara.\nPlayers.\nAppearances.\n\"As of 1 March 2019\"\nGoalscorers.\n\"As of 1 March 2019\""
