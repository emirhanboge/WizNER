    "text": "Michael W. Vranos is an American &lt;a href=\"hedge%20fund\"&gt;hedge fund&lt;/a&gt; manager and philanthropist who in the 1990s was referred to by some as the \"most powerful man on &lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street\"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;.\" In 1993, he reportedly earned &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Dollar\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;15 million from trading &lt;a href=\"mortgage%20bond\"&gt;mortgage bond&lt;/a&gt;s. \"&lt;a href=\"Fortune%20Magazine\"&gt;Fortune Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" once called him \"one of the best bond &lt;a href=\"Trader%20%28finance%29\"&gt;trader&lt;/a&gt;s on Wall Street.\" According to a 2007 \"&lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street%20Journal\"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" article, he has continued to be regarded as \"the best-known mortgage-bond trader on Wall Street.\"\nVranos headed &lt;a href=\"collateralized%20mortgage%20obligation\"&gt;collateralized mortgage obligation&lt;/a&gt; (CMO) trading in the early 1990s at &lt;a href=\"Kidder%20Peabody\"&gt;Kidder Peabody&lt;/a&gt; at a time when that firm dominated the marketplace. Seizing the opportunity created by a &lt;a href=\"Market%20trends%23Bear%20market\"&gt;bear market&lt;/a&gt;, he left to start his own firm, Ellington Management Group, in late 1994. That same year, Kidder Peabody fell on troubled times and was sold to &lt;a href=\"PaineWebber\"&gt;PaineWebber&lt;/a&gt;. In spite of being affected by fall-out from the &lt;a href=\"Long-Term%20Capital%20Management\"&gt;Long-Term Capital Management&lt;/a&gt; debacle in 1998, as of April 2004, Ellington had delivered a composite annualized return of 15.4%, after fees.\nEarly life and education.\nVranos was born in &lt;a href=\"Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Worcester, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; to Alexander and Aglaea Vranos, both of Greek descent. He was then raised in &lt;a href=\"Ellington%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Ellington, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. In his youth, he worked as a bouncer and earned the title of Mr. Teen Connecticut as a bodybuilder. He earned the nickname \"The Arm\". Mr. Vranos earned his &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Bachelor of Arts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Academic%20degree\"&gt;degree&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; in 1983 with both \"&lt;a href=\"magna%20cum%20laude\"&gt;magna cum laude&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Phi%20Beta%20Kappa\"&gt;Phi Beta Kappa&lt;/a&gt; honors. He began pursuing a PhD in Mathematics, before beginning his work on Wall Street.\nKidder Peabody.\nVranos started work at &lt;a href=\"Kidder%20Peabody\"&gt;Kidder Peabody&lt;/a&gt; after graduation from Harvard in 1983. He was the youngest &lt;a href=\"Managing%20Director\"&gt;Managing Director&lt;/a&gt; in the 130-year history of Kidder Peabody. During his reign at Kidder Peabody from 1990\u20131994, Kidder &lt;a href=\"underwriting\"&gt;underwrote&lt;/a&gt; over $200 billion in CMOs, which was about 20% of all CMOs issued during that period and nearly double the next largest Wall Street firm. Vranos was noted for having turned his collateralized mortgage obligation trading role into a money-making machine. In 1991, Vranos was named Kidder Peabody\u2019s Man of the Year. His 1992 compensation was estimated at between $10\u201315 million, according to the \"&lt;a href=\"USA%20Today\"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;\", while \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" reported it in the $5\u20137 million range. By 1993 he was the highest paid employee at Kidder Peabody, and it was said that as Kidder entered financial trouble in the early 1990s that the profitability of the company was largely on Vranos' back.\nKidder Peabody fell on troubled times during the bear market of 1994. Losses in the mortgage-bonds department headed by Vranos for the second quarter of 1994 were $30 million. Michael Carpenter, the &lt;a href=\"CEO\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; of Kidder from 1989 to 1994 was forced to resign in July 1994. Then, when the number two ranking executive at the firm, Edward A. Cerullo, resigned from Kidder Peabody a few weeks later, Vranos was one of the most watched firm members. During this period, Vranos was highly praised by &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Welch\"&gt;Jack Welch&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of Kidder Peabody\u2019s parent company, &lt;a href=\"General%20Electric\"&gt;General Electric&lt;/a&gt;, for his handling of the bear market. However, as market conditions grew more severe, Vranos left to start his own firm in late 1994. Kidder was ultimately sold to &lt;a href=\"Paine%20Webber\"&gt;Paine Webber&lt;/a&gt;.\nEllington Management Group.\nIn late 1994, Vranos founded Ellington Management Group, which grew into a $21 billion company. He founded the firm with Laurence Penn, whom Vranos knew at Harvard and who was in charge of &lt;a href=\"Lehman%20Brothers\"&gt;Lehman Brother's&lt;/a&gt; mortgage securities training before co-founding Ellington with funding from Ziff Brothers Investments. By the end of 1995 the firm had become a three-fund operation with a variety of assets.\nEllington was affected by the &lt;a href=\"Long-Term%20Capital%20Management\"&gt;Long-Term Capital Management&lt;/a&gt; debacle in 1998. For a few days in mid-October, the firm sold mortgage securities to lower its funds' leverage. The firm issued a public statement describing its borrowings to quell public fears, which was considered unusual for hedge funds at the time. It clarified that although it was meeting &lt;a href=\"margin%20call\"&gt;margin call&lt;/a&gt;s by unloading hundreds of millions of dollars in assets over a two-day period, losses were limited. One report suggests some of his hedge funds may have temporarily lost around 25% of their value as he liquidated $2 billion in assets after allegedly missing a margin call from &lt;a href=\"UBS\"&gt;UBS&lt;/a&gt;. However, from its December 1994 inception through April 2004, the firm delivered a composite annualized return of 15.4%, after fees.\nIn 2000, Ellington bid on Laser Mortgage Management Inc., a mortgage real estate investment trust that was considering closing, but ultimately did not purchase it. Various of Ellington's funds have invested in distressed mortgage-backed securities over time. By 2004 his $3 billion in hedge fund assets including mortgage derivatives. In October 2007, as the future credit performance of residential mortgages became increasingly uncertain, one of his funds is reported to have fallen in value by 22% and to have temporarily suspended redemptions pending greater clarity around valuations. As of 2007, Vranos and Ellington Management managed $5.4 billion in hedge funds and private accounts, and an additional $1.2 billion in a managed account, while also managing almost $23 billion in &lt;a href=\"collateralized%20debt%20obligation\"&gt;collateralized debt obligation&lt;/a&gt;s. In 2014 Vranos opened an office for Ellington Management in &lt;a href=\"London%2C%20England\"&gt;London, England&lt;/a&gt; in order to expand into the European market.\nIn June 2007, Vranos launched a &lt;a href=\"private%20placement\"&gt;private placement&lt;/a&gt; of a new entity, Ellington Financial LLC, to &lt;a href=\"institutional%20investors\"&gt;institutional investors&lt;/a&gt;. The offering primarily targeted investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities. The deal was underwritten by &lt;a href=\"Friedman%20Billings%20Ramsey\"&gt;Friedman Billings Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; and although originally slated for a $750 million offering, evolving market conditions only allowed for a $250 million capital raise. Before the private placement, a New York Times columnist noted that a portion of the private placement might be used to purchase risky &lt;a href=\"tranche\"&gt;tranche&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"bankrupt\"&gt;bankrupt&lt;/a&gt; subprime lender &lt;a href=\"New%20Century%20Financial%20Corporation\"&gt;New Century Financial Corporation&lt;/a&gt; and noted the potential difficulty in valuing such instruments. In October 2010, Ellington Financial LLC went public, debuting on the NYSE. , Vranos owned (directly or indirectly) over 2.5 million shares. According to its public filings, Ellington Financial invests primarily in non-agency mortgage-backed securities, but also holds agency pools and other mortgage-related securities, and had a total return of 59% between its August 2007 inception and the end of 2011.\nEllington Residential Mortgage REIT, chaired and founded by Vranos, went public on the NYSE after its IPO in late 2013, trading under the ticker symbol EARN.\nPersonal.\nIn 1981, Vranos was declared Mr. Teen Connecticut in the state's bodybuilding championships, and he became known as \"Captain Iron\" in bodybuilding circles. Vranos is known for breaking up business meetings to issue &lt;a href=\"armwrestling\"&gt;armwrestling&lt;/a&gt; challenges. Vranos currently lives in &lt;a href=\"Greenwich%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Greenwich, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;.
