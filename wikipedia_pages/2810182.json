It is located within the central portion of the &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Range\"&gt;Douglas Range&lt;/a&gt;, standing at the heads of &lt;a href=\"Toynbee%20Glacier\"&gt;Toynbee Glacier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sedgwick%20Glacier\"&gt;Sedgwick Glacier&lt;/a&gt; west of &lt;a href=\"George%20VI%20Sound\"&gt;George VI Sound&lt;/a&gt;, near the east coast of &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Island\"&gt;Alexander Island&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"British%20Antarctic%20Territory\"&gt;British Antarctic Territory&lt;/a&gt;. At an elevation of , Mount Stephenson is the highest mountain in the Douglas Range and the highest point on Alexander Island. &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Egbert\"&gt;Mount Egbert&lt;/a&gt; ranks second, standing at 2,895 m and lies south-southeast of Mount Stephenson.\nThe mountain was probably first seen in 1909 by the &lt;a href=\"French%20Antarctic%20Expedition\"&gt;French Antarctic Expedition&lt;/a&gt; under Charcot, but not recognized as part of the Douglas Range. It was first surveyed in 1936 by Stephenson, Fleming, and Bertram of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Graham%20Land%20Expedition\"&gt;British Graham Land Expedition&lt;/a&gt; (BGLE) under Rymill. The east side of the mountain was resurveyed in 1948 by the &lt;a href=\"Falkland%20Islands%20Dependencies%20Survey\"&gt;Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey&lt;/a&gt; (FIDS) who named the feature for &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Stephenson\"&gt;Alfred Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;, surveyor and leader of the BGLE party to George VI Sound in 1936. Another landform on Alexander Island happens to be named for Alfred Stephenson, &lt;a href=\"Stephenson%20Nunatak\"&gt;Stephenson Nunatak&lt;/a&gt;."
