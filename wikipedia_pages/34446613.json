It is the UK's largest dairy &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt; and the UK's largest producer of &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012 the company merged with &lt;a href=\"Arla%20Foods\"&gt;Arla Foods&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIt was formed in April 2000 as one of three successor co-operatives to &lt;a href=\"Milk%20Marque\"&gt;Milk Marque&lt;/a&gt;. Milk Marque was broken up after the &lt;a href=\"Competition%20Commission%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Competition Commission&lt;/a&gt; queried how it set milk prices.\nIn July 2002, the company bought the &lt;a href=\"Crediton\"&gt;Crediton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kirkcudbright\"&gt;Kirkcudbright&lt;/a&gt; creameries from &lt;a href=\"Express%20Dairies\"&gt;Express Dairies&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a333.1 million, which both make &lt;a href=\"Ultra-high-temperature%20processing\"&gt;UHT milk&lt;/a&gt;. It also bought out the 50% of joint-venture partner Express Dairies in the creamery at &lt;a href=\"Frome\"&gt;Frome&lt;/a&gt;. As noted below, the Crediton operations were later sold in a management buyout.\nIn February 2004 it set up The Cheese Company with &lt;a href=\"Kilkenny\"&gt;Kilkenny&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Glanbia\"&gt;Glanbia&lt;/a&gt;, which had four cheese production sites and a packing facility supplying major retailers in the UK, in which it took a 75% stake. In December 2006 it bought out Glanbia for \u00a347.2 million.\nIn July 2005 it closed a site at &lt;a href=\"Sible%20Hedingham\"&gt;Sible Hedingham&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom October 2007 to February 2008 there were talks to merge with &lt;a href=\"First%20Milk%20%28company%29\"&gt;First Milk&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 2011 it split into two divisions named 'Milk Link, Cheese' and 'Milk Link, Milk'.\nIn September 2011 it announced that it would increase the size of the &lt;a href=\"Lockerbie\"&gt;Lockerbie&lt;/a&gt; creamery by 50% to produce 37,000 tonnes of cheese a year, into a UK market which consumes 600,000 tonnes of cheese a year.\nIn 2012 the company merged with Arla Foods.\nProducts.\nEach year it handles around 1.5 billion litres of milk.\nIt makes the chocolate-flavoured milk under licence for the \"&lt;a href=\"Mars%20%28chocolate%20bar%29\"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20%28chocolate%29\"&gt;Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;\" brand.\nCheeses.\nIt exports cheese to 19 countries."
