    "text": "Ion Luca Caragiale (; commonly referred to as I. L. Caragiale; \u2013 9 June 1912) was a &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n playwright, short story writer, poet, theater manager, political commentator and journalist. Leaving behind an important cultural legacy, he is considered one of the greatest playwrights in &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian language&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Literature%20of%20Romania\"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one of its most important writers and a leading representative of &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20humor\"&gt;local humour&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Eminescu\"&gt;Mihai Eminescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Slavici\"&gt;Ioan Slavici&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Creang%C4%83\"&gt;Ion Creang\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, he is seen as one of the main representatives of \"&lt;a href=\"Junimea\"&gt;Junimea&lt;/a&gt;\", an influential literary society with which he nonetheless parted during the second half of his life. His work, spanning four decades, covers the ground between &lt;a href=\"Neoclassicism\"&gt;Neoclassicism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Realism%20%28arts%29\"&gt;Realism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Naturalism%20%28literature%29\"&gt;Naturalism&lt;/a&gt;, building on an original synthesis of foreign and local influences.\nAlthough few in number, Caragiale's plays constitute the most accomplished expression of &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian theater&lt;/a&gt;, as well as being important venues for criticism of late-19th-century Romanian society. They include the &lt;a href=\"Comedy\"&gt;comedies&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"O%20noapte%20furtunoas%C4%83\"&gt;O noapte furtunoas\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Conu%20Leonida%20fa%C5%A3%C4%83%20cu%20reac%C5%A3iunea\"&gt;Conu Leonida fa\u0163\u0103 cu reac\u0163iunea&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"O%20scrisoare%20pierdut%C4%83\"&gt;O scrisoare pierdut\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", and the &lt;a href=\"tragedy\"&gt;tragedy&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"N%C4%83pasta\"&gt;N\u0103pasta&lt;/a&gt;\". In addition to these, Caragiale authored the &lt;a href=\"melodrama\"&gt;melodrama&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"O%20soacr%C4%83\"&gt;O soacr\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", a large number of essays, articles, short stories, &lt;a href=\"novella\"&gt;novella&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sketch%20story\"&gt;sketch stories&lt;/a&gt;, as well as occasional works of poetry and autobiographical texts such as \"&lt;a href=\"Din%20carnetul%20unui%20vechi%20sufleur\"&gt;Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur&lt;/a&gt;\". In many cases, his creations were first published in one of several magazines he edited\u2014\"&lt;a href=\"Claponul\"&gt;Claponul&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Moftul%20Rom%C3%A2n\"&gt;Moftul Rom\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Vatra%20%28literary%20magazine%29\"&gt;Vatra&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Epoca%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Epoca&lt;/a&gt;\". Most of his prose works have been published under the title \"&lt;a href=\"Momente%20%C5%9Fi%20schi%C5%A3e\"&gt;Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e&lt;/a&gt;\": they include \"&lt;a href=\"C%C4%83ldur%C4%83%20mare\"&gt;C\u0103ldur\u0103 mare&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"C%C4%83nu%C5%A3%C4%83%20om%20sucit\"&gt;C\u0103nu\u0163\u0103 om sucit&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Dou%C4%83%20loturi\"&gt;Dou\u0103 loturi&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hotel%20%26quot%3BVictoria%20rom%C3%A2n%C4%83%26quot%3B\"&gt;Grand Hotel \"Victoria rom\u00e2n\u0103\"&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as several pieces referring to &lt;a href=\"stock%20character\"&gt;stock character&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Lache%20and%20Mache\"&gt;Lache and Mache&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Chico%C5%9F%20Rostogan\"&gt;Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mitic%C4%83\"&gt;Mitic\u0103&lt;/a&gt;. In some of his later fiction writings, including \"&lt;a href=\"La%20hanul%20lui%20M%C3%A2njoal%C4%83\"&gt;La hanul lui M\u00e2njoal\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Kir%20Ianulea\"&gt;Kir Ianulea&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Abu-Hasan\"&gt;Abu-Hasan&lt;/a&gt;,\" \"&lt;a href=\"Pastram%C4%83%20trufanda\"&gt;Pastram\u0103 trufanda&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Calul%20dracului\"&gt;Calul dracului&lt;/a&gt;\", Caragiale adopted the &lt;a href=\"Fantasy%20literature\"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; genre or turned to &lt;a href=\"historical%20fiction\"&gt;historical fiction&lt;/a&gt;.\nIon Luca Caragiale was interested in the politics of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and oscillated between the &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20and%20radicalism%20in%20Romania\"&gt;liberal current&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"conservatism\"&gt;conservatism&lt;/a&gt;. Most of his &lt;a href=\"Satire\"&gt;satirical&lt;/a&gt; works target the liberal &lt;a href=\"Republicanism\"&gt;republicans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201875%29\"&gt;National Liberals&lt;/a&gt;, evidencing both his respect for their rivals at \"Junimea\" and his connections with the literary critic &lt;a href=\"Titu%20Maiorescu\"&gt;Titu Maiorescu&lt;/a&gt;. He came to clash with National Liberal leaders such as &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20Sturdza\"&gt;Dimitrie Sturdza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Petriceicu%20Hasdeu\"&gt;Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu&lt;/a&gt;, and was a lifelong adversary of the &lt;a href=\"Symbolism%20%28arts%29\"&gt;Symbolist&lt;/a&gt; poet &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Macedonski\"&gt;Alexandru Macedonski&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of these conflicts, the most prominent of &lt;a href=\"Criticism%20of%20Ion%20Luca%20Caragiale\"&gt;Caragiale's critics&lt;/a&gt; barred his access to the cultural establishment for several decades. During the 1890s, Caragiale rallied with the &lt;a href=\"Radicalism%20%28historical%29\"&gt;radical&lt;/a&gt; movement of &lt;a href=\"George%20Panu\"&gt;George Panu&lt;/a&gt;, before associating with the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201880%E2%80%931918%29\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;. After having decided to settle in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, he came to voice strong criticism for Romanian politicians of all colours in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"1907%20Romanian%20Peasants%27%20Revolt\"&gt;1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately joined the &lt;a href=\"Conservative-Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Conservative-Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tache%20Ionescu\"&gt;Tache Ionescu&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was both a friend and rival to writers such as Mihai Eminescu, Titu Maiorescu, and &lt;a href=\"Barbu%20%C5%9Etef%C4%83nescu%20Delavrancea\"&gt;Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea&lt;/a&gt;, while maintaining contacts with, among others, the \"Junimist\" essayist &lt;a href=\"Iacob%20Negruzzi\"&gt;Iacob Negruzzi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Socialism\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; philosopher &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Dobrogeanu-Gherea\"&gt;Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&lt;/a&gt;, the literary critic &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Zarifopol\"&gt;Paul Zarifopol&lt;/a&gt;, the poets &lt;a href=\"George%20Co%C5%9Fbuc\"&gt;George Co\u015fbuc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mite%20Kremnitz\"&gt;Mite Kremnitz&lt;/a&gt;, the psychologist &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20R%C4%83dulescu-Motru\"&gt;Constantin R\u0103dulescu-Motru&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;n poet and activist &lt;a href=\"Octavian%20Goga\"&gt;Octavian Goga&lt;/a&gt;. Ion Luca was the nephew of &lt;a href=\"Costache%20Caragiale\"&gt;Costache&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iorgu%20Caragiale\"&gt;Iorgu Caragiale&lt;/a&gt;, who were major figures of the 19th century Romanian theatre. His sons &lt;a href=\"Mateiu%20Caragiale\"&gt;Mateiu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Caragiale\"&gt;Luca&lt;/a&gt; were both &lt;a href=\"Modernism\"&gt;modernist&lt;/a&gt; writers.\nBiography.\nBackground and name.\nIon Luca Caragiale was born into a family of &lt;a href=\"Greeks%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; descent, whose members first arrived in Wallachia soon after 1812, during the rule of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Gheorghe%20Caragea\"&gt;Ioan Gheorghe Caragea&lt;/a&gt;\u2014\u015etefan Caragiali, as his grandfather was known locally, worked as a cook for the court in &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. Ion Luca's father, who reportedly originated from the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, settled in &lt;a href=\"Prahova%20County\"&gt;Prahova County&lt;/a&gt; as the curator of the &lt;a href=\"M%C4%83rgineni%20Monastery\"&gt;M\u0103rgineni Monastery&lt;/a&gt; (which, at the time, belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Greek Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Catherine%27s%20Monastery%2C%20Mount%20Sinai\"&gt;Saint Catherine's Monastery&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Sinai\"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/a&gt;). Known to locals as Luca Caragiali, he later built a reputation as a lawyer and judge in &lt;a href=\"Ploie%C5%9Fti\"&gt;Ploie\u015fti&lt;/a&gt;, and married Ecaterina, the daughter of a merchant from the &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;n town of &lt;a href=\"Bra%C5%9Fov\"&gt;Bra\u015fov&lt;/a&gt;. Her &lt;a href=\"maiden%20name\"&gt;maiden name&lt;/a&gt; was given as \"Alexovici\" (\"Alexevici\") or as \"Karaboa\" (\"Caraboa\"). She is known to have been Greek herself, and, according to historian Lucian Nastas\u0103, some of her relatives were &lt;a href=\"Hungarians\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; members of the Tabay family. The Caragiali couple also had a daughter, named Lenci.\nIon Luca's uncles, &lt;a href=\"Costache%20Caragiale\"&gt;Costache&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iorgu%20Caragiale\"&gt;Iorgu Caragiale&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"Caragiali\", managed theater troupes and were very influential figures in the development of early &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian theater&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in Wallachia and &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt; alike. Luca Caragiali had himself performed with his brothers during his youth, before opting to settle down. All three had stood criticism for not taking part in the &lt;a href=\"Wallachian%20Revolution%20of%201848\"&gt;Wallachian Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, and defended themselves through a &lt;a href=\"brochure\"&gt;brochure&lt;/a&gt; printed in 1848. The brothers Caragiali had two sisters, Ecaterina and Anastasia.\nEspecially in his old age, the writer emphasized his family's humble background and his status as a &lt;a href=\"self-made%20man\"&gt;self-made man&lt;/a&gt;. On one occasion, he defined the landscape of his youth as \"the quagmires of Ploie\u015fti\". Although it prompted his biographer &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Dobrogeanu-Gherea\"&gt;Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&lt;/a&gt; to define him as \"a &lt;a href=\"Proletariat\"&gt;proletarian&lt;/a&gt;\", Caragiale's account was disputed by several other researchers, who noted that the family had a good social standing.\nIon Luca Caragiale was discreet about his ethnic origin for the larger part of his life. In parallel, his foreign roots came to the attention of his adversaries, who used them as arguments in various polemics. As his relations with Caragiale degenerated into hostility, &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Eminescu\"&gt;Mihai Eminescu&lt;/a&gt; is known to have referred to his former friend as \"that Greek swindler\". Aware of such treatment, the writer considered all references to his lineage to be insults. On several occasions, he preferred to indicate that he was \"of obscure birth\".\nNevertheless, as literary critic &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20Vianu\"&gt;Tudor Vianu&lt;/a&gt; noted, Caragiale's outlook on life was explicitly &lt;a href=\"Balkan\"&gt;Balkan&lt;/a&gt;ic and &lt;a href=\"Orient\"&gt;Orient&lt;/a&gt;al, which, in Vianu's view, mirrored a type \"which must have been found in his lineage\". A similar opinion was expressed by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Zarifopol\"&gt;Paul Zarifopol&lt;/a&gt;, who speculated that Caragiale's conservative mindset was possibly owed to the \"lazyness of one true Oriental\" (elsewhere, he referred to the writer as \"a lazy southerner, fitted with definitely supranormal intelligence and imagination\"). In his main work on the history of Romanian literature, &lt;a href=\"George%20C%C4%83linescu\"&gt;George C\u0103linescu&lt;/a&gt; included Caragiale among a group of \"Balkan\" writers, whose &lt;a href=\"middle%20class\"&gt;middle class&lt;/a&gt; status and often foreign origin, he argued, set them apart irrespective of their period\u2014others in this category were, in chronological order, &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Pann\"&gt;Anton Pann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20Arghezi\"&gt;Tudor Arghezi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Minulescu\"&gt;Ion Minulescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Urmuz\"&gt;Urmuz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mateiu%20Caragiale\"&gt;Mateiu Caragiale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Barbu\"&gt;Ion Barbu&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, critic &lt;a href=\"Garabet%20Ibr%C4%83ileanu\"&gt;Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu&lt;/a&gt; proposed that Caragiale's Wallachian origin was of particular importance, serving to explain his political choices and alleged social bias.\nOn one occasion, Caragiale mentioned that his paternal grandfather was \"a Greek cook\". In several contexts, he referred to his roots as being in the island of &lt;a href=\"Hydra%2C%20Saronic%20Islands\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. In one of his photographs, he posed in Oriental costume and sitting cross-legged, which was interpreted by Vianu as an additional reference to his Balkan background. Two of his biographers, Zarifopol and &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Eerban%20Cioculescu\"&gt;\u015eerban Cioculescu&lt;/a&gt;, noted that a section of Caragiale's &lt;a href=\"fairy%20tale\"&gt;fairy tale&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Kir%20Ianulea\"&gt;Kir Ianulea&lt;/a&gt;\" was a likely self-reference: in that fragment of text, the &lt;a href=\"Devil%20in%20Christianity\"&gt;Christian Devil&lt;/a&gt;, disguised as an &lt;a href=\"Arvanites\"&gt;Arvanite&lt;/a&gt; trader, is shown taking pride in his &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian language&lt;/a&gt; skills.\nInvestigations carried out by the Center of Theatric Research in &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and made public in 2002 offered an alternative take on the Caragiales' origin. According to this perspective, \u015etefan Caragiali was a native of &lt;a href=\"Kefalonia\"&gt;Kefalonia&lt;/a&gt;, and his original surname, \"Karaialis\", was changed on Prince Caragea's request. Various authors also believe that Caragiale's ancestors were &lt;a href=\"Albanians%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aromanians\"&gt;Aromanian&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally, Ion Luca was known as \"Ioanne L. Caragiali\". His family and friends knew him as \"Iancu\" or, rarely, \"Iancu\u0163u\"\u2014both being antiquated &lt;a href=\"hypocoristic\"&gt;hypocoristic&lt;/a&gt;s of \"Ion\". The definitive full version of his features the syllable \"ca\" twice in a row, which is generally avoided in Romanian due to its scatological connotations. It has however become one of the few &lt;a href=\"Phonaesthetics\"&gt;cacophonies&lt;/a&gt; accepted by the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Academy\"&gt;Romanian Academy&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly years.\nBorn in the village of &lt;a href=\"I.%20L.%20Caragiale%2C%20D%C3%A2mbovi%C5%A3a\"&gt;Haimanale&lt;/a&gt;, Prahova County (the present-day I. L. Caragiale &lt;a href=\"commune%20in%20Romania\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A2mbovi%C5%A3a%20County\"&gt;D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a County&lt;/a&gt;), Caragiale was educated in Ploie\u015fti. During his early years, as he later indicated, he learned reading and writing with a teacher at the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Romanian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; of Saint George. Soon after, he was taught &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;literary Romanian&lt;/a&gt; by the Transylvanian-born Bazilie Drago\u015fescu (whose influence on his use of the language he was to acknowledge in one of his later works). At the age of seven, he witnessed enthusiastic celebrations of the &lt;a href=\"Danubian%20Principalities\"&gt;Danubian Principalities&lt;/a&gt;' union, with the election of Moldavia's &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Ioan%20Cuza\"&gt;Alexandru Ioan Cuza&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Wallachia; Cuza's subsequent reforms were to be an influence on the political choices Caragiale made in his old age. The new ruler visited his primary school later in 1859, being received with enthusiasm by Drago\u015fescu and all his pupils.\nCaragiale completed &lt;a href=\"Gymnasium%20%28school%29\"&gt;gymnasium&lt;/a&gt; at the Sfin\u0163ii Petru \u015fi Pavel school in the city, and never pursued any form of higher education. He was probably enlisted directly in the second grade, as records do not show him to have attended or graduated the first year. Notably, Caragiale was taught history by Constantin Iennescu, who was later the mayor of Ploie\u015fti. The young Caragiale opted to follow in his uncles' footsteps, and was taught declamation and mimic art by Costache at the latter's theater school in &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, where he was accompanied by his mother and sister. It is also probable that he was a &lt;a href=\"supernumerary%20actor\"&gt;supernumerary actor&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Theatre%20Bucharest\"&gt;National Theater Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. He was not able to find full employment in this field, and, around the age of 18, worked as a &lt;a href=\"copyist\"&gt;copyist&lt;/a&gt; for the Prahova County Tribunal. Throughout his life, Caragiale refused to talk about his training in the theater, and hid it from the people closest to him (including his wife Alexandrina Burelly, who came from an upper middle class environment).\nIn 1866, Caragiale witnessed Cuza's toppling by a coalition of &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201880%E2%80%931918%29\"&gt;conservatives&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20and%20radicalism%20in%20Romania\"&gt;liberals&lt;/a&gt;\u2014as he later acknowledged in his \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hotel%20%26quot%3BVictoria%20Rom%C3%A2n%C4%83%26quot%3B\"&gt;Grand Hotel \"Victoria Rom\u00e2n\u0103\"&lt;/a&gt;\", he and his friends agreed to support the move by voting \"yes\" during a subsequent &lt;a href=\"plebiscite\"&gt;plebiscite&lt;/a&gt;, and, with tacit approval from the new authorities, even did so several times each. By the age of 18, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the liberal current, and sympathized with its &lt;a href=\"Republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; ideals. In 1871, he witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ploie%C5%9Fti\"&gt;Republic of Ploie\u015fti&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a short-lived stated created by the liberal groups, in an attempt to oust \"&lt;a href=\"Domnitor\"&gt;Domnitor&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Carol%20I%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Carol I&lt;/a&gt; (the future &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Romania\"&gt;King of Romania&lt;/a&gt;). Later in life, as his opinions veered towards &lt;a href=\"conservatism\"&gt;conservatism&lt;/a&gt;, Caragiale ridiculed both the attempted \"&lt;a href=\"coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;\" and his participation in it.\nHe returned to Bucharest later that year, after manager &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Pascaly\"&gt;Mihail Pascaly&lt;/a&gt; hired him as one of the &lt;a href=\"Prompter%20%28theatre%29\"&gt;prompts&lt;/a&gt; at the National Theater in the capital, a period about which he reminisced in his \"&lt;a href=\"Din%20carnetul%20unui%20vechi%20sufleur\"&gt;Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur&lt;/a&gt;\". The poet &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Eminescu\"&gt;Mihai Eminescu&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Ion Luca was to have cordial relations as well as rivalries, had previously been employed for the same position by the manager Iorgu Caragiale. In addition to his growing familiarity with the &lt;a href=\"Repertoire%20%28theatre%29\"&gt;repertoire&lt;/a&gt;, the young Caragiale educated himself by reading the philosophical works of &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Enlightenment-era&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"philosophe\"&gt;philosophe&lt;/a&gt;s\". It was also recorded that, at some point between 1870 and 1872, he was employed in the same capacity by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Theatre%20Ia%C5%9Fi\"&gt;Moldavian National Theater&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ia%C5%9Fi\"&gt;Ia\u015fi&lt;/a&gt;. During the period, Caragiale also &lt;a href=\"Proofreading\"&gt;proofread&lt;/a&gt; for various publications and worked as a &lt;a href=\"tutor\"&gt;tutor&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiterary debut.\nIon Luca made his literary debut in 1873, at the age of 21, with poems and humorous chronicles printed in &lt;a href=\"G.%20Dem.%20Teodorescu\"&gt;G. Dem. Teodorescu&lt;/a&gt;'s liberal-inspired satirical magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Ghimpele\"&gt;Ghimpele&lt;/a&gt;\". He published relatively few articles under various &lt;a href=\"pen%20name\"&gt;pen name&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014among them \"Car.\", the contraction of his family name, and the more elaborate \"Palicar\". He mostly performed basic services for the editorial staff and its &lt;a href=\"printing%20press\"&gt;printing press&lt;/a&gt;, given that, after Luca Caragiali died in 1870, he was the sole provider for his mother and sister. Following his return to Bucharest, he became even more involved with the &lt;a href=\"Radicalism%20%28historical%29\"&gt;radical&lt;/a&gt; and republican wing of the liberal trend\u2014a movement commonly referred to as \"the Reds\". As he later confessed, he frequently attended its congresses, witnessing the speeches held by Reds leader &lt;a href=\"C.%20A.%20Rosetti\"&gt;C. A. Rosetti&lt;/a&gt;; he thus became intimately acquainted with a &lt;a href=\"Populism\"&gt;Populist&lt;/a&gt; discourse, which he later &lt;a href=\"Parody\"&gt;parodied&lt;/a&gt; in his works. Working for \"Ghimpele\", he made the acquaintance of republican writer &lt;a href=\"N.%20T.%20Or%C4%83%C5%9Fanu\"&gt;N. T. Or\u0103\u015fanu&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral of his articles for \"Ghimpele\" were sarcastic in tone, and targeted various literary figures of the day. In June 1874, Caragiale amused himself at the expense of &lt;a href=\"N.%20D.%20Popescu-Popnedea\"&gt;N. D. Popescu-Popnedea&lt;/a&gt;, the author of popular &lt;a href=\"almanac\"&gt;almanac&lt;/a&gt;s, whose taste he questioned. Soon after, he ridiculed the rising poet &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Macedonski\"&gt;Alexandru Macedonski&lt;/a&gt;, who had publicized his claim that he was a \"Count Geniadevsky\", and thus of &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; origin. The article contributed by Caragiale, in which he speculated that Macedonski (referred to with the &lt;a href=\"anagram\"&gt;anagram&lt;/a&gt; \"Aamsky\") was using the name solely because it reminded people of the word \"genius\", was the first act in a long polemic between the two literary figures. Caragiale turned Aamsky into a character on his own, envisaging his death as a result of overwork in editing magazines \"for the country's political development\".\nCaragiale also contributed poetry to \"Ghimpele\": two &lt;a href=\"sonnet\"&gt;sonnet&lt;/a&gt;s, and a series of &lt;a href=\"epigram\"&gt;epigram&lt;/a&gt;s (one of which was another attack on Macedonski). The first of these works, an 1873 sonnet dedicated to &lt;a href=\"baritone\"&gt;baritone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Agostino%20Mazzoli\"&gt;Agostino Mazzoli&lt;/a&gt;, is believed to have been his first contribution to the \"&lt;a href=\"belles-lettres\"&gt;belles-lettres&lt;/a&gt;\" (as opposed to journalism).\nIn 1896, Macedonski reflected with irony:\n\"As early as 1872, the clients of some &lt;a href=\"beer%20garden\"&gt;beer garden&lt;/a&gt;s in the capital have had the occasion to welcome among them of a noisy young man, a bizarre spirit who seemed destined, were he to have devoted himself to letters or the arts, to be entirely original. Indeed, this young man's appearance, his hasty gestures, his sarcastic smile [...], his always irritated and mocking voice, as well as his &lt;a href=\"Sophism\"&gt;sophistic&lt;/a&gt; reasoning easily attracted attention.\"\nOver the following years, Caragiale collaborated on various mouthpieces of the newly created &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201875%29\"&gt;National Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;, and, in May 1877, created the satirical magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Claponul\"&gt;Claponul&lt;/a&gt;\". Later in 1877, he also translated a series of &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French-language&lt;/a&gt; plays for the National Theater: &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Parodi%20%28playwright%29\"&gt;Alexandre Parodi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Rome vaincue\" (it was showcased in late 1877-early 1878), &lt;a href=\"Paul%20D%C3%A9roul%C3%A8de\"&gt;Paul D\u00e9roul\u00e8de&lt;/a&gt;'s \"L'Hetman\", and &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20Scribe\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne Scribe&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Une camaraderie\". Together with the &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; republican &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Dam%C3%A9\"&gt;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dam\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, he also headed a short-lived journal, \"Na\u0163iunea Rom\u00e2n\u0103\".\nIt was also then that he contributed a serialized overview of Romanian theater, published by the newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Rom%C3%A2nia%20Liber%C4%83\"&gt;Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", in which Caragiale attacked the inferiority of Romanian &lt;a href=\"dramaturgy\"&gt;dramaturgy&lt;/a&gt; and the widespread recourse to &lt;a href=\"plagiarism\"&gt;plagiarism&lt;/a&gt;. According to literary historian &lt;a href=\"Perpessicius\"&gt;Perpessicius&lt;/a&gt;, the series constituted \"one of the most solid critical contributions to the history of our theater\".\nMacedonski later alleged that, in his contributions to the liberal newspapers, the young writer had &lt;a href=\"libel\"&gt;libel&lt;/a&gt;ed several &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201880%E2%80%931918%29\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; politicians\u2014when researching this period, &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Eerban%20Cioculescu\"&gt;\u015eerban Cioculescu&lt;/a&gt; concluded that the accusation was false, and that only one polemical article on a political topic could be traced back to Caragiale.\n\"Timpul\" and \"Claponul\".\nThe young journalist began drifting away from National Liberal politics soon after 1876, when the group came to power with &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Br%C4%83tianu\"&gt;Ion Br\u0103tianu&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;. According to many versions, Eminescu, who was working on the editorial staff of the main Conservative newspaper, \"&lt;a href=\"Timpul\"&gt;Timpul&lt;/a&gt;\", asked to be joined by Caragiale and the Transylvanian prose writer &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Slavici\"&gt;Ioan Slavici&lt;/a&gt;, who were both employed by the paper. This order of events remains unclear, and depends on sources saying that Eminescu was employed by the paper in March 1876. Other testimonies indicate that it was actually Eminescu who arrived last, beginning work in January 1878.\nSlavici later recalled that three of them engaged in lengthy discussions at \"Timpul\"'s headquarters on &lt;a href=\"Calea%20Victoriei\"&gt;Calea Victoriei&lt;/a&gt; and in Eminescu's house on Sfin\u0163ilor Street, where they planned to co-author a massive work on &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20grammar\"&gt;Romanian grammar&lt;/a&gt;. According to literary historian &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20Vianu\"&gt;Tudor Vianu&lt;/a&gt;, the relationship between Caragiale and Eminescu partly replicated that between the latter and the &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Creang%C4%83\"&gt;Ion Creang\u0103&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver that period, \"Timpul\" and Eminescu were engaged in a harsh polemic with the Reds, and especially their leader Rosetti. It was also then that Romania entered the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%931878%29\"&gt;Russo-Turkish War&lt;/a&gt; as a means to secure her complete independence from the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Caragiale reportedly took little interest in editing \"Timpul\" over that period, but it is assumed that several unsigned chronicles, covering foreign events, are his contributions (as are two short story adaptations of works by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; author &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Allan%20Poe\"&gt;Edgar Allan Poe&lt;/a&gt;, both published by \"Timpul\" in spring-summer 1878). The newspaper was actually issued as a collaborative effort, which makes it hard to identify the authors of many other articles. According to Slavici, Caragiale occasionally completed unfinished contributions by Eminescu whenever the latter had to leave unexpectedly.\nHe concentrated instead on \"Claponul\", which he edited and wrote single-handedly for the duration of the war. Zarifopol believed that, through the series of light satires he contributed for the magazine, Caragiale was trying out his style, and thus \"entertaining the suburbanites, in order to study them\". A piece he authored of the time featured an imaginary barber and amateur artist, N\u0103stase \u015etirbu, who drew a direct parallel between art, literature and cutting hair\u2014both the theme and the character were to be reused in his later works. Similarly, a fragment of prose referring to two inseparable friends, \u015eotrocea and Motrocea, was to serve as the first draft for the &lt;a href=\"Lache%20and%20Mache\"&gt;Lache and Mache&lt;/a&gt; series in \"&lt;a href=\"Momente%20%C5%9Fi%20schi%C5%A3e\"&gt;Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e&lt;/a&gt;\". Another notable work of the time is \"Pohod la \u015fosea\", a rhyming &lt;a href=\"reportage\"&gt;reportage&lt;/a&gt; documenting the &lt;a href=\"Military%20history%20of%20Imperial%20Russia\"&gt;Russian Army&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival to Bucharest, and the street reactions to the event. \"Claponul\" ceased publication in early 1878.\n\"Junimea\" reception.\nIt was probably through Eminescu that Ion Luca Caragiale came into contact with the &lt;a href=\"Ia%C5%9Fi\"&gt;Ia\u015fi&lt;/a&gt;-based \"&lt;a href=\"Junimea\"&gt;Junimea&lt;/a&gt;\", the influential literary society which was also a center for anti-National Liberal politics. Initially, Caragiale met with \"Junimea\" founder, the critic and politician &lt;a href=\"Titu%20Maiorescu\"&gt;Titu Maiorescu&lt;/a&gt;, during a visit to the house of Dr. Kremnitz, physician to the family of \"&lt;a href=\"Domnitor\"&gt;Domnitor&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Carol%20I%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Carol I&lt;/a&gt;. The doctor's wife and Maiorescu's sister-in-law, &lt;a href=\"Mite%20Kremnitz\"&gt;Mite Kremnitz&lt;/a&gt;, was herself a writer, and later became Eminescu's lover. During several meetings, Caragiale was asked by Maiorescu to write down a series of &lt;a href=\"aphorism\"&gt;aphorism&lt;/a&gt;s in an album. His concise musings are contemplative in tone, and some of them constitute evidence of both &lt;a href=\"misanthropy\"&gt;misanthropy&lt;/a&gt; and, to a certain degree, &lt;a href=\"misogyny\"&gt;misogyny&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1878, Caragiale and Maiorescu left for Ia\u015fi, where they attended \"Junimea\" 's 15th anniversary, and where Caragiale read his first draft of the celebrated play \"&lt;a href=\"O%20noapte%20furtunoas%C4%83\"&gt;O noapte furtunoas\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\". The work, ridiculing the \"&lt;a href=\"petite%20bourgeoisie\"&gt;petite bourgeoisie&lt;/a&gt;\" 's mix of liberal values and &lt;a href=\"demagogy\"&gt;demagogy&lt;/a&gt; over a background of superficial culture, immediately struck a chord with the majority-conservative grouping. Its reception was one of the pivotal moments in the second period of \"Junimea\" activities, characterized by the society's expansion to Bucharest and its &lt;a href=\"patronage\"&gt;patronage&lt;/a&gt; of the arts. Other writers who marked this stage were Creang\u0103, Slavici, &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Alecsandri\"&gt;Vasile Alecsandri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Conta\"&gt;Vasile Conta&lt;/a&gt;\u2014together with Caragiale, they soon became the foremost representatives of \"Junimea\" 's direct influence on literature. To varying degrees, they all complimented the main element of \"Junimist\" discourse, Maiorescu criticism of \"forms without a foundation\"\u2014the concept itself referred to the negative impact of &lt;a href=\"modernization\"&gt;modernization&lt;/a&gt;, which, \"Junimea\" argued, had by then only benefited the upper strata of Romanian society, leaving the rest with an incomplete and increasingly falsified culture.\nIon Luca Caragiale also associated with \"Junimea\"'s mouthpiece, \"&lt;a href=\"Convorbiri%20Literare\"&gt;Convorbiri Literare&lt;/a&gt;\", and continued to contribute there even after 1885, when the society began to decline in importance. It was here that all his major comedies were first presented to the public. He did not, however, join &lt;a href=\"Petre%20P.%20Carp\"&gt;Petre P. Carp&lt;/a&gt;'s movement, which aimed to consolidate \"Junimea\" as a third force in Romanian politics, and remained a staunch independent over the following years. Caragiale was nevertheless associated with the \"Junimist\" journal \"&lt;a href=\"Constitu%C5%A3ionalul\"&gt;Constitu\u0163ionalul&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn early January 1879, \"O noapte furtunoas\u0103\" was first staged by the National Theater. Its production brought the first association between Caragiale and comedian &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Mateescu\"&gt;Mihai Mateescu&lt;/a&gt;, who went on to portray some of his most popular characters. The play was a hit, and acclaim reached Caragiale despite the fact that he had refused to have his name printed on the posters. Caragiale was soon outraged to discover that, by the second staging, his text had been toned down by the government-appointed Head of Theaters, the National Liberal &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Ghica\"&gt;Ion Ghica&lt;/a&gt;. When he asked for an official explanation, \"O noapte furtunoas\u0103\" was removed from the season's program. Over the following years, independent troupes staged the play or its &lt;a href=\"Plagiarism\"&gt;plagiarized&lt;/a&gt; versions for their own benefit. It was restored to the National Theater's repertoire in 1883, and was so successful that state theaters in cities such as &lt;a href=\"Craiova\"&gt;Craiova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ia%C5%9Fi\"&gt;Ia\u015fi&lt;/a&gt; made efforts to have it included in their own programs.\nCaragiale subsequently took part in directing his plays at the National Theater, where his main collaborator was actor and manager &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20I.%20Nottara\"&gt;Constantin I. Nottara&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they are credited with having put a stop to the techniques favored by &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Pascaly\"&gt;Mihail Pascaly&lt;/a&gt;, replacing emphatic declamation with a more natural and studied perspective on acting.\nInspector general.\nIn 1880, he printed \"&lt;a href=\"Conu%20Leonida%20fa%C5%A3%C4%83%20cu%20reac%C5%A3iunea\"&gt;Conu Leonida fa\u0163\u0103 cu reac\u0163iunea&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014a play centered on an uncultured \"Red\" pensioner and his naive wife, who overhear a street brawl and believe that a revolution is imminent. It was also then that his first memoirs from the world of theater were published, which coincided with the release of &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Creang%C4%83\"&gt;Ion Creang\u0103&lt;/a&gt;'s own book of memoirs, the well-known volume \"&lt;a href=\"Amintiri%20din%20copil%C4%83rie\"&gt;Amintiri din copil\u0103rie&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAccompanied by Maiorescu, Caragiale left for &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, the two of them attended a staging of &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream\"&gt;A Midsummer Night's Dream&lt;/a&gt;\", hosted by the &lt;a href=\"Burgtheater\"&gt;Burgtheater&lt;/a&gt;. He was practically unemployed after returning, and, in 1881, gave up his position at \"Timpul\". Nevertheless, that autumn, &lt;a href=\"V.%20A.%20Urechia\"&gt;V. A. Urechia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Education%2C%20Research%20and%20Youth%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Minister of Education&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Br%C4%83tianu\"&gt;Ion Br\u0103tianu&lt;/a&gt; National Liberal cabinet, assigned him the office of inspector general for the Moldavian counties of &lt;a href=\"Suceava%20County\"&gt;Suceava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neam%C5%A3%20County\"&gt;Neam\u0163&lt;/a&gt;. Profiting from the proximity between his new residence and Ia\u015fi, Ion Luca Caragiale became a regular participant in \"Junimea\"'s activities, becoming good friends with some of its most important representatives (&lt;a href=\"Iacob%20Negruzzi\"&gt;Iacob Negruzzi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Pogor\"&gt;Vasile Pogor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Petru%20Th.%20Missir\"&gt;Petru Th. Missir&lt;/a&gt;). With Negruzzi, he dramatized \"Hatmanul Baltag\", a short story by &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Gane\"&gt;Nicolae Gane&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe became close to &lt;a href=\"Veronica%20Micle\"&gt;Veronica Micle&lt;/a&gt;, a woman writer who was also Eminescu's mistress. For a while, Caragiale and Micle had a love affair, although she continued to see the poet. This caused the friendship between Eminescu and Caragiale to sour. The former was jealous of Cargiale's relations with Micle, while she resented the poet's affair with Mite Kremnitz.\nJust one year after, Caragiale was moved back to Wallachia, becoming inspector general in &lt;a href=\"Arge%C8%99%20County\"&gt;Arge\u0219&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A2lcea%20County\"&gt;V\u00e2lcea&lt;/a&gt;. He was ultimately stripped of this position in 1884, and found himself on the verge of &lt;a href=\"bankruptcy\"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;; he thus accepted the lowly position of &lt;a href=\"clerk%20%28position%29\"&gt;clerk&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"civil%20registry\"&gt;civil registry&lt;/a&gt; administration. It is probably during this period that his &lt;a href=\"melodrama\"&gt;melodrama&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"O%20soacr%C4%83\"&gt;O soacr\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\" was written and published\u2014Caragiale, who was aware of its faults, indicated that it was a work from his youth, and dated it to 1876. His account is challenged by several details in the text.\nIn June 1883, while visiting Maiorescu's house, he received news that Eminescu had suffered the first in a series of &lt;a href=\"dementia\"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; attacks (owing to a disease that was to kill him in 1889). Caragiale reportedly broke into tears. This succession of events also saw him becoming involved in conflicts among \"Junimea\" members: like Pogor, Caragiale objected to the style of &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Alecsandri\"&gt;Vasile Alecsandri&lt;/a&gt;, an aged \"Junimist\" poet, and was shocked to find out that he was ridiculing the much younger Eminescu. He thus decided to criticize Alecsandri in public, during a March 1884 meeting of the society\u2014Maiorescu recorded in his private notes that \"[...] Caragiale [was] aggressive and rude toward Alecsandri.\"\nCaragiale's wealthy relative, Catinca Momulo Cardini (commonly known Catinca Momuloaia), who was the widow of a famous restaurateur and the cousin of his mother Ecaterina, died in 1885, and the writer had the prospect of inheriting a large fortune. He nonetheless became involved in a trial with Momuloaia's other relatives, which prolonged itself until the early 20th century.\nFirst major successes.\nMonths after this, his new comedy, \"&lt;a href=\"O%20scrisoare%20pierdut%C4%83\"&gt;O scrisoare pierdut\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", was first shown to the public. A fresco of conflicting &lt;a href=\"political%20machine\"&gt;political machine&lt;/a&gt;s, provincial &lt;a href=\"Political%20corruption\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;, petty ambitions, and incoherent demagogy, it was an instant hit with the public. Arguably the high point of Caragiale's career, it became one of the best-known works of its kind in Romanian literature. Maiorescu was pleased by its success, and believed that it was a sign of maturity in Romanian society, which, as he put it, was \"starting to laugh\" at the National Liberal rhetoric.\nIon Luca Caragiale was romantically involved with an unmarried young woman, Maria Constantinescu, who worked for the &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in 1885, she gave birth to &lt;a href=\"Mateiu%20Caragiale\"&gt;Mateiu&lt;/a&gt;, whom Caragiale recognized as his son.\nDuring the same year, Caragiale's \"&lt;a href=\"D-ale%20carnavalului\"&gt;D-ale carnavalului&lt;/a&gt;\", a lighter satire of suburban morals and amorous misadventures, was received with &lt;a href=\"booing\"&gt;booing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"heckler\"&gt;heckling&lt;/a&gt; by members of the public\u2014critics deemed it \"immoral\", due to its frank depiction of &lt;a href=\"adultery\"&gt;adultery&lt;/a&gt; gone unpunished. The controversy saw Maiorescu taking his friend's side and publishing an essay highly critical of National Liberal cultural tenets (titled \"&lt;a href=\"Comediile%20domnului%20Caragiale\"&gt;Comediile domnului Caragiale&lt;/a&gt;\", it was to be reprinted in 1889, as a preface to Caragiale's collected plays). In it, the critic, who was influenced by the ideas of &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Schopenhauer\"&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer&lt;/a&gt;, argued that Caragiale had not failed in uplifting the human spirit, precisely because he had risen above both &lt;a href=\"didacticism\"&gt;didacticism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"egotism\"&gt;egotism&lt;/a&gt; (\"see &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Schopenhauer%27s%20aesthetics\"&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics&lt;/a&gt;\"). In reference to accusations that the play was &lt;a href=\"Patriotism\"&gt;unpatriotic&lt;/a&gt;, Maiorescu answered:\n\"[...] the present-day poems with a political intent, the odes on solemn days, the theatrical compositions for dynastic glorifications are a simulacrum of art, and not the real art. Even patriotism, the most important sense for the citizen of a state in his actions as a citizen, has no place in art as an ad-hoc form of patriotism [...]. Is there a single lyric of French patriotism in &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Corneille\"&gt;Corneille&lt;/a&gt;? Is there any national spouting in &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Racine\"&gt;Racine&lt;/a&gt;? Is there one in &lt;a href=\"Moli%C3%A8re\"&gt;Moli\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;? Is there one in &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;? Is there one in &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe\"&gt;Goethe&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nThe article played an essential part in reconciling the dramatist to the general public, but also led to a polemic between Maiorescu and the philosopher &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Dobrogeanu-Gherea\"&gt;Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Marxism\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; who claimed that Maiorescu was contradicting himself). Dobrogeanu-Gherea argued in favor of Caragiale's work, but considered \"D-ale carnavalului\" to be his weakest play.\nTheater leadership and marriage.\nDespite his earlier conflicts with the National Liberals, Caragiale, who still faced problems in making a living, agreed to contribute pieces for the party press, and thus briefly associated with \"&lt;a href=\"Voin%C5%A3a%20Na%C5%A3ional%C4%83\"&gt;Voin\u0163a Na\u0163ional\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\" (a journal issued by historian and politician &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Dimitrie%20Xenopol\"&gt;Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol&lt;/a&gt;). Under the pen name \"Luca\", he contributed two theater chronicles. In parallel, he taught classes at the privately run Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe High School in Bucharest. This episode of his career ended in 1888, when Maiorescu ascended to the office of Minister of Education in the &lt;a href=\"Teodor%20Rosetti\"&gt;Teodor Rosetti&lt;/a&gt; cabinet (formed by a group of \"Junimist\" Conservatives). Caragiale requested to be appointed Head of Theaters, which also implied leadership of the National Theater. Although Maiorescu was initially opposed, Caragiale eventually received the post. The ultimate decision was attributed to Romania's &lt;a href=\"Elisabeth%20of%20Wied\"&gt;Queen Elisabeth&lt;/a&gt; having asked Maiorescu to reconsider, or, alternatively, to the support offered by the influential \"Junimist\" &lt;a href=\"Petre%20P.%20Carp\"&gt;Petre P. Carp&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe appointment caused some controversy at the time: Ion Luca Caragiale, unlike all his predecessors (the incumbent &lt;a href=\"C.%20I.%20St%C4%83ncescu\"&gt;C. I. St\u0103ncescu&lt;/a&gt; included), was both a professional in the field and a person of modest origins. As the National Liberals intensified their campaign against him, the dramatist drafted an &lt;a href=\"open%20letter\"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; for the Bucharest press, outlining his intentions and explaining the circumstances of his appointment. In it, he attributed his own rise to the interest \"Junimea\" had taken in his work, while defending the literary society, which was, as he put it, \"lost from the public eye at a time of political obscurity\". Reviewing his own merits as a writer and manager, he elaborated and later put into practice a program for state-run theaters\u2014according to Vianu, it signified \"punctuality and rigor\". He nonetheless resigned at the end of the season, and resumed his literary activities.\nIn January 1889, he married Alexandrina, the daughter of architect Gaetano Burelly. She was a member of the Bucharest elite, which served to improve Ion Luca Caragiale's social standing. They had two children of their own: &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Caragiale\"&gt;Luca&lt;/a&gt; (known as Luky; born 1893) and Ecaterina (or Tu\u015fchi; born 1894, later married Logadi). Several years later, the Caragiales brought Mateiu into their home, and Ion Luca enrolled him at &lt;a href=\"Anghel%20Demetrescu\"&gt;Anghel Demetrescu&lt;/a&gt;'s Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe College.\nClash with the Academy.\nEarly in 1890, at the same time as his volume of collected works, Caragiale published and staged his rural-themed &lt;a href=\"tragedy\"&gt;tragedy&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"N%C4%83pasta\"&gt;N\u0103pasta&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014both writings were presented for consideration to the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Academy\"&gt;Romanian Academy&lt;/a&gt;, in view of receiving its annual prize, the &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Heliade%20R%C4%83dulescu\"&gt;Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu&lt;/a&gt; Award. Caragiale's conflict with the National Liberals reached its peak, as two of their representatives inside the forum, historian &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Petriceicu%20Hasdeu\"&gt;Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu&lt;/a&gt; and future &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20Sturdza\"&gt;Dimitrie Sturdza&lt;/a&gt;, reported unfavorably. Additional criticism was voiced by the poet &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Sion\"&gt;Gheorghe Sion&lt;/a&gt;, who also defended the a work by &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Dobrogeanu-Gherea\"&gt;Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&lt;/a&gt; (itself up for review). When the \"Junimist\" &lt;a href=\"Iacob%20Negruzzi\"&gt;Iacob Negruzzi&lt;/a&gt; defended his friend, Sturdza contrasted Caragiale's works with his own version of &lt;a href=\"didacticism\"&gt;didacticism&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it altogether lacked a moral and national quality.\nBoth Hasdeu and Sturdza hinted at the influence exercised over Caragiale by their adversary Maiorescu, and went on to compare the dramatist with foreign writers such as &lt;a href=\"Mite%20Kremnitz\"&gt;Mite Kremnitz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Josef%20B.%20Brociner\"&gt;Josef B. Brociner&lt;/a&gt;. For the two liberal leaders, Kremnitz and Brociner, who had authored works critical of the Romanian establishment, were aiding to construct a negative image of the Romanian nation. Hasdeu insisted that Caragiale was himself creating problems for the country, while Sturza, showing himself more lenient in this respect, insisted that Caragiale's plays had failed to display a love for \"the truth, the beautiful and the good\". He stressed:\n\"Mr. Caragiale should learn how to respect his nation, and not mock it.\"\nSturdza's discourse contributed to the Academy's negative vote (20 votes against and 3 in favor), and rose Caragiale's anger. In parallel, Dobrogeanu-Gherea's candidature for the prize was rejected with 16 votes against and 8 for. In 1897, writing for the Conservative paper \"&lt;a href=\"Epoca%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Epoca&lt;/a&gt;\", the writer lashed out at Sturdza and his partisans, claiming that they viewed all humorous talents as \"unholy\", \"useless to the nation\", and \"downright perilous\". Vianu noted that Caragiale's article directly aimed at Sturdza's reverence for &lt;a href=\"Jacobin%20%28politics%29\"&gt;Jacobinism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"collectivism\"&gt;collectivism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"nationalism\"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt;, which, in Caragiale's own words,\n\"manipulated the baggage of big words with which the phony liberal school has been filling empty heads for fifty years on end\".\nSplit with \"Junimea\".\nDuring the controversy, Caragiale published two memoirs of Eminescu\u2014the poet had died in June 1889. One of them was titled \"\u00cen Nirvana\" (\"Into &lt;a href=\"Nirvana\"&gt;Nirvana&lt;/a&gt;\"), and notably expanded on the early years of their friendship and on one of Eminescu's earliest amorous disappointments. In an essay of the following year, he showed himself critical of a wave of Eminescu imitators, commenting: \"A lot of reasonable people will walk the path and [...] of the people that know them only a few will raise their hats; whereas an insane person [...] will be followed by all the people. That is why the success of the [1890 Eminescu edition] has overcome all the editors' expectations\". He also reprinted his recollections from the world of theater, alongside pieces originally published in \"&lt;a href=\"Claponul\"&gt;Claponul&lt;/a&gt;\" and various new satirical pieces.\nAlthough this attack owed much to \"Junimea\"'s discourse, Caragiale had by then turned against Maiorescu, probably due to his perception that the society had failed to support his cause at the Academy. In May 1892, he used a public conference at the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Athenaeum\"&gt;Romanian Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt; as a venue to make known his claims against the former Minister of Education and his associates, which caused a definitive rift between the two public figures. Caragiale also wrote \"Dou\u0103 note\" (\"Two Notes\"), an article accusing Maiorescu of having modified and censored some of Eminescu's poems, and of having exploited the poet for financial gain. Around that time, he ceased contributing to \"&lt;a href=\"Convorbiri%20Literare\"&gt;Convorbiri Literare&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLate in 1892, Caragiale published two volumes of prose, including his new &lt;a href=\"novella\"&gt;novella&lt;/a&gt;s \"&lt;a href=\"P%C4%83cat\"&gt;P\u0103cat&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"O%20f%C4%83clie%20de%20Pa%C5%9Fte\"&gt;O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Om%20cu%20noroc\"&gt;Om cu noroc&lt;/a&gt;\". The following year, he began frequenting &lt;a href=\"Socialism\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; circles as an outsider to the cause, and soon became good friends with the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial Russian&lt;/a&gt;-born &lt;a href=\"Marxism\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; thinker &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Dobrogeanu-Gherea\"&gt;Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&lt;/a&gt;. Financial constraints forced Caragiale to become an entrepreneur, and, in November of that year, opened a &lt;a href=\"beer%20garden\"&gt;beer garden&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Gabroveni%20Inn\"&gt;Gabroveni Inn&lt;/a&gt;, in Bucharest's &lt;a href=\"Lipscani\"&gt;Lipscani&lt;/a&gt; area. He probably moved on soon after, and purchased a pub on a neighboring street. In a letter he wrote at the time, the writer showed that he was planning to move to &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;, and considered starting a career as a teacher.\nIn November 1893, as a gesture of goodwill towards his adversary, &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Macedonski\"&gt;Alexandru Macedonski&lt;/a&gt; authored an article in \"&lt;a href=\"Literatorul\"&gt;Literatorul&lt;/a&gt;\", in which he asked authorities if it was normal for a former Head of Theaters not to have a stable source of income\u2014the intended recipient did not acknowledge this offer, and the Caragiale-Macedonski conflict escalated after he continued to attack the latter in the press. One year later, Caragiale leased the restaurant catering to the train station in &lt;a href=\"Buz%C4%83u\"&gt;Buz\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; (just like Dobrogeanu-Gherea had done in &lt;a href=\"Ploie%C5%9Fti\"&gt;Ploie\u015fti&lt;/a&gt;). His successive businesses were all struggling, and Caragiale was often on the verge of &lt;a href=\"bankruptcy\"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;. Although he invested time and work in the enterprise, and even affiliated with the International Association of Waiters for a short period, he eventually decided not to renew his contract upon the years' end. His period in Buz\u0103u was noted for its other results: in February 1895, the press reported that Caragiale had given a public lecture on \"the causes of human stupidity\".\n\"Moftul Rom\u00e2n\" and \"Vatra\".\nTogether with the socialist activist &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Bacalba%C5%9Fa\"&gt;Tony Bacalba\u015fa&lt;/a&gt; and the illustrator &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Jiquidi\"&gt;Constantin Jiquidi&lt;/a&gt;, he established the satirical magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Moftul%20Rom%C3%A2n\"&gt;Moftul Rom\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt;\", which ceased print after a few months, before being revived in 1901 and becoming an important venue for &lt;a href=\"social%20criticism\"&gt;social criticism&lt;/a&gt;. The new publication's spirit was indebted to \"Junimist\" discourse. Its title, translatable as \"the Romanian trifle\" or \"the Romanian nonsense\", alluded to the &lt;a href=\"Cynicism%20%28contemporary%29\"&gt;cynicism&lt;/a&gt; and self-importance of the emerging modern Romanian society. According to Vianu, this was a theme first debated by \"Junimea\"'s &lt;a href=\"Theodor%20Rosetti\"&gt;Theodor Rosetti&lt;/a&gt;. \"Moft!\" thus mimicked the common answer to any important or merely exacerbated problem, and Caragiale also used it to illustrate what he saw as a common national feature. In one of his early editorials for the magazine, he claimed that \"moft\" was to Romanians what &lt;a href=\"spleen\"&gt;spleen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Melancholia\"&gt;melancholy&lt;/a&gt;) was to the &lt;a href=\"English%20people\"&gt;English people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nihilism\"&gt;nihilism&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Russians\"&gt;Russians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chauvinism\"&gt;chauvinism&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Hungarians\"&gt;Hungarians&lt;/a&gt;, and \"&lt;a href=\"Feud\"&gt;vendetta&lt;/a&gt;\" to the &lt;a href=\"Italians\"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn parallel, Cargiale resumed his contacts with Transylvanian &lt;a href=\"intellectual\"&gt;intellectual&lt;/a&gt;s: with &lt;a href=\"George%20Co%C5%9Fbuc\"&gt;George Co\u015fbuc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Slavici\"&gt;Ioan Slavici&lt;/a&gt;, he founded the magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Vatra%20%28literary%20magazine%29\"&gt;Vatra&lt;/a&gt;\" (1 January 1894), before withdrawing from its leadership. During his short stay, he printed an unsigned &lt;a href=\"sketch%20story\"&gt;sketch story&lt;/a&gt;, \"Cum se \u00een\u0163eleg \u0163\u0103ranii\" (\"How Peasants Communicate\"), which mockingly recorded a lengthy and redundant dialog between two villagers, as well as a portrait of the deceased politician &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Kog%C4%83lniceanu\"&gt;Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"fairy%20tale\"&gt;fairy tale&lt;/a&gt; inspired by the writings of &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Pann\"&gt;Anton Pann&lt;/a&gt;. He also translated a &lt;a href=\"novella\"&gt;novella&lt;/a&gt; authored by his friend, &lt;a href=\"Elisabeth%20of%20Wied\"&gt;Queen Elisabeth&lt;/a&gt;, under the title \"R\u0103zbunare\" (\"Revenge\")\u2014he is known to have been annoyed by the longueurs of the piece, and struck out large portions of it to improve the flow.\nDuring the same period, Caragiale had the initiative to publish short fragments he had translated from classical pieces, leaving readers to guess who their authors were\u2014Vianu, citing the speculations made by other critics, presumed that these were writers admired by both Caragiale and his friend, the schoolteacher &lt;a href=\"Anghel%20Demetrescu\"&gt;Anghel Demetrescu&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Carlyle\"&gt;Thomas Carlyle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexis%20de%20Tocqueville\"&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Babington%20Macaulay%2C%201st%20Baron%20Macaulay\"&gt;Thomas Babington Macaulay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Guizot\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Guizot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Nicolas%20Augustin%20Thierry\"&gt;Augustin Thierry&lt;/a&gt;). It was also then that he authored a piece on &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20I%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Prince Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"heir%20apparent\"&gt;heir apparent&lt;/a&gt;, who had fallen severely ill\u2014it shows Caragiale to be a passionate defender of the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian monarchy&lt;/a&gt;, praying for Ferdinand's health. In 1898, he wrote a lengthy essay on the state of Romanian theater, in which he notably praised the actor &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Brezeanu\"&gt;Ion Brezeanu&lt;/a&gt;, who made his name through portrayals of Caragiale's characters, for, among others, his \"sober and refined interpretation\". Later that year, he published a new novella, \"&lt;a href=\"%C3%8En%20vreme%20de%20r%C4%83zboi\"&gt;\u00cen vreme de r\u0103zboi&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"fantasy\"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; set to the background of the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%931878%29\"&gt;Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878&lt;/a&gt;.\nRadical Party.\nIn 1895, at the age of 43, Caragiale decided to join the Radical Party, led at the time by former \"Junimist\" &lt;a href=\"George%20Panu\"&gt;George Panu&lt;/a&gt;; one year later, he began contributing to its mouthpiece, the newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Ziua\"&gt;Ziua&lt;/a&gt;\". He was also briefly associated with the newspaper \"Sara\", published in &lt;a href=\"Ia%C5%9Fi\"&gt;Ia\u015fi&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Caragiale was again an associate of the National Liberals later the same year, when the Conservative cabinet of &lt;a href=\"Lasc%C4%83r%20Catargiu\"&gt;Lasc\u0103r Catargiu&lt;/a&gt; was replaced with one led by &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20Sturdza\"&gt;Dimitrie Sturdza&lt;/a&gt;. Articles he contributed to \"Gazeta Poporului\", a National Liberal newspaper, were centered on new attacks against \"Junimea\" and were signed with the pseudonyms \"i\" and \"Ion\". In mid-November 1895, \"Gazeta Poporului\" published an unsigned article which discussed the suicide of writer &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Odobescu\"&gt;Alexandru Odobescu&lt;/a&gt;, investigating the mundane reasons behind it\u2014the piece is generally attributed to Caragiale. The writer placed the blame for Odobescu's death on his much younger lover, Hortensia Racovi\u0163\u0103, and hailed his wife, Sa\u015fa Odobescu, as a model of devoted womanhood.\nThis episode of his life coincided with a period when relations between Romania and &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt; were extremely tense. Three years before, &lt;a href=\"Romanians\"&gt;ethnic Romanian&lt;/a&gt; leaders in Austro-Hungarian-ruled Transylvania had signed the \"&lt;a href=\"Transylvanian%20Memorandum\"&gt;Transylvanian Memorandum&lt;/a&gt;\", which inflamed passions among the Hungarians and led the authors to be indicted. &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201880%E2%80%931918%29\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; politicians in Romania had succeeded in negotiating an &lt;a href=\"amnesty\"&gt;amnesty&lt;/a&gt;, but their policies were overturned by the National Liberals, who appealed to nationalist and &lt;a href=\"Irredentism\"&gt;irredentist&lt;/a&gt; sentiment.\nThus, Sturdza offered a measure of support to &lt;a href=\"Eugen%20Brote\"&gt;Eugen Brote&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Tribuna%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Tribuna&lt;/a&gt;\" editor and &lt;a href=\"National%20Romanian%20Party\"&gt;National Romanian Party&lt;/a&gt; activist. Brote, who fled Transylvania and planned to directly implicate the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; into the conflict, attempted to replace the pro-Conservative leadership of the National Party with a selection of politicians favored by the National Liberals. As Sturdza came to lead the cabinet, both he and Brote retracted their previous statements, but again provoked the National Party by alleging that its leaders were the actual radicals. In harsh terms, Caragiale exposed the understanding Sturdza had with Brote. Soon after, he authored a short story about a con artist who traveled to the imagined Transylvanian town of Opidul-nou, posing as the nationalist Romanian writer &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Vlahu%C5%A3%C4%83\"&gt;Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103&lt;/a&gt; as a means to live off the local &lt;a href=\"intelligentsia\"&gt;intelligentsia&lt;/a&gt;. In October 1897, he was outraged by news that Sturdza had given in to Austro-Hungarian demands, and that he had expelled Transylvanian nationalists from Romania: Caragiale held a speech in which he argued that Romanians living abroad were \"indispensable\" to the Romanian state.\n\"Epoca\".\nIn 1895, the writer followed the Radical group into its unusual merger with the Conservative Party. This came at a time of unified opposition, when the \"Junimists\" themselves returned to their group of origin. Caragiale came to identify with the policies endorsed by a new group of Conservative leaders, &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Filipescu\"&gt;Nicolae Filipescu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Lahovari\"&gt;Alexandru Lahovari&lt;/a&gt; among them. He was upset when Lahovari died not too long after, and authored his &lt;a href=\"obituary\"&gt;obituary&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaragiale also became a collaborator on Filipescu's journal \"&lt;a href=\"Epoca%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Epoca&lt;/a&gt;\" and editor of its literary supplement. A chronicle he contributed at the time discussed the philosophical writings of Dobrogeanu-Gherea: while sympathetic to his conclusions, Caragiale made a clear statement that he was not interested in the socialist doctrine or any other ideology (\"Any idea, opinion or system is absolutely irrelevant to me, in the most absolute sense\"). He also published an article criticizing Dimitrie Sturdza; its title, \"O lichea\" (roughly: \"A Scoundrel\"), was reluctantly accepted by \"Epoca\", and only after Caragiale claimed that it reflected the original meaning of the word \"lichea\" (\"stain\"), explaining that it referred to Sturdza's unusual persistence in politics.\nWhen answering to one of \"Epoca\"'s inquiries, he showed that he had yet again come to reevaluate \"Junimea\", and found it to be an essential institution in Romanian culture. Nevertheless, he was distancing himself from the purest \"Junimist\" tenets, and took a favorable view of &lt;a href=\"Romanticism\"&gt;Romantic&lt;/a&gt; writers whom the society had criticized or ridiculed\u2014among these, he indicated his personal rival &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Petriceicu%20Hasdeu\"&gt;Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu&lt;/a&gt;, whom he acknowledged to be among \"the most remarkable figures of our literature\", and &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Odobescu\"&gt;Alexandru Odobescu&lt;/a&gt;. As editor of \"Epoca\", he published works by Hasdeu alongside those of his other contemporaries and predecessors\u2014&lt;a href=\"Grigore%20Alexandrescu\"&gt;Grigore Alexandrescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Filimon\"&gt;Nicolae Filimon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dinicu%20Golescu\"&gt;Dinicu Golescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Heliade%20R%C4%83dulescu\"&gt;Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cilibi%20Moise\"&gt;Cilibi Moise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Costache%20Negruzzi\"&gt;Costache Negruzzi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Pann\"&gt;Anton Pann&lt;/a&gt;. He also took a more sympathetic but still distant view of Maiorescu. At the time, he befriended the young poet &lt;a href=\"Cincinat%20Pavelescu\"&gt;Cincinat Pavelescu&lt;/a&gt;, and helped to promote his works in the press.\n\"Universul\".\nAround that time, Caragiale began collaborating with the formerly \"Junimist\" figure &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Dragomirescu\"&gt;Mihail Dragomirescu&lt;/a&gt;, who enlisted his anonymous contributions to the magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Convorbiri%20Critice\"&gt;Convorbiri Critice&lt;/a&gt;\". Again pressed by financial problems, he returned to a bureaucratic post\u2014this time with the administration of &lt;a href=\"Government%20monopoly\"&gt;government monopolies&lt;/a&gt;, and appointed by the Conservative cabinet of &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Grigore%20Cantacuzino\"&gt;Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino&lt;/a&gt; in June 1899. In 1901, the position was suppressed due to cutbacks in budget spending. This coincided with Sturdza's third mandate as &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;, and further aggravated the conflict between the two figures.\nAt the same time, Caragiale was contributing to &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Cazzavillan\"&gt;Luigi Cazzavillan&lt;/a&gt;'s newly founded daily, \"&lt;a href=\"Universul\"&gt;Universul&lt;/a&gt;\", where he was assigned the column \"Noti\u0163e critice\" (\"Critical Notes\"). This material formed the bulk of his collected short prose volume, \"&lt;a href=\"Momente%20%C5%9Fi%20schi%C5%A3e\"&gt;Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e&lt;/a&gt;\", and notably comprised satirical pieces ridiculing the Romanian press' reaction to the activities of &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Sarafov\"&gt;Boris Sarafov&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Macedonia%20%28region%29\"&gt;Macedonian&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Bulgarians\"&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt; revolutionary who had attempted to set up a base in Romania.\nHe continued to pursue a business career, and, in 1901, inaugurated his own company, \"Ber\u0103ria cooperativ\u0103\", which took over the \"&lt;a href=\"Gambrinus%20%28Bucharest%29\"&gt;Gambrinus&lt;/a&gt;\" pub in front of the National Theater. It soon became the site of a literary circle, which included, among others, Tony Bacalba\u015fa and Ion Brezeanu, the satirist &lt;a href=\"Dumitru%20Constantinescu-Teleorm%C4%83neanu\"&gt;Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleorm\u0103neanu&lt;/a&gt; (known as \"Teleor\"), and the academic I. Suchianu. At the time, the Caragiales rented a house in Bucharest, near the present-day &lt;a href=\"Bulevardul%20Magheru\"&gt;Bulevardul Magheru&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn early 1901, as Ion Luca Caragiale entered his 25th year in literature, his friends offered him a &lt;a href=\"banquet\"&gt;banquet&lt;/a&gt; at \"Gambrinus\", where speeches were given by &lt;a href=\"Barbu%20%C5%9Etef%C4%83nescu%20Delavrancea\"&gt;Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea&lt;/a&gt; and the Conservative politician &lt;a href=\"Take%20Ionescu\"&gt;Take Ionescu&lt;/a&gt;, and where a special single-issue magazine, \"Caragiale\", was circulated among the guests. Hasdeu put aside his differences in opinion and sent in a congratulatory letter. In it, he deemed the dramatist \"Romania's &lt;a href=\"Moli%C3%A8re\"&gt;Moli\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;\". Nevertheless, on 23 March 1902, the National Liberal majority in the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Academy\"&gt;Romanian Academy&lt;/a&gt;, headed by Sturdza, refused to consider \"Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e\" for the &lt;a href=\"N%C4%83sturel%20Her%C4%83scu\"&gt;N\u0103sturel Her\u0103scu&lt;/a&gt; Award\u2014despite a favorable report from &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20C.%20Oll%C4%83nescu-Ascanio\"&gt;Dimitrie C. Oll\u0103nescu-Ascanio&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaion scandal.\nSoon after, Caragiale became involved in a major literary scandal. &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Al.%20Ionescu-Caion\"&gt;Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion&lt;/a&gt;, a journalist and student whom &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20Vianu\"&gt;Tudor Vianu&lt;/a&gt; described as \"a real pathological character\", issued a claim that, in his \"&lt;a href=\"N%C4%83pasta\"&gt;N\u0103pasta&lt;/a&gt;\", the Romanian dramatist had &lt;a href=\"Plagiarism\"&gt;plagiarized&lt;/a&gt; the work of a &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20language\"&gt;Hungarian-language&lt;/a&gt; author named Istv\u00e1n Kem\u00e9ny. Caion expanded on this in articles published by \"&lt;a href=\"Revista%20Literar%C4%83\"&gt;Revista Literar\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", where he provided direct comparisons between the two texts. This was received with enthusiasm by Caragiale's old rival, &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Macedonski\"&gt;Alexandru Macedonski&lt;/a&gt;, who publicized the controversy through one of his journals, \"&lt;a href=\"For%C5%A3a%20Moral%C4%83\"&gt;For\u0163a Moral\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\". Initially amazed by the similarity between the two texts, Caragiale carried out his own investigations, and, in the end, discovered that neither the writing nor Kem\u00e9ny had ever existed. Employing \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea as his lawyer, he brought Caion to trial: a court sentenced Caion for &lt;a href=\"calumny\"&gt;calumny&lt;/a&gt;, but he was &lt;a href=\"Acquittal\"&gt;acquitted&lt;/a&gt; after an &lt;a href=\"appeal\"&gt;appeal&lt;/a&gt; in June 1902. Several commentators believe that this was owed to a strong National Liberal presence among members of the jury. During the retrial, Caion retracted all his previous claims, and instead argued that \"N\u0103pasta\" plagiarized &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Tolstoy\"&gt;Leo Tolstoy&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Power%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;The Power of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMacedonski supported the lost cause until the very end, and refused to distance himself from Caion even as the latter admitted to the court that he had invented the story. His magazine also accused Caragiale of having copied &lt;a href=\"Victorien%20Sardou\"&gt;Victorien Sardou&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Rabagas\" for his \"&lt;a href=\"O%20scrisoare%20pierdut%C4%83\"&gt;O scrisoare pierdut\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Chivot\"&gt;Henri Chivot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Duru\"&gt;Alfred Duru&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Le Carnaval d'un Merle Blanc\" in \"&lt;a href=\"D-ale%20carnavalului\"&gt;D-ale carnavalului&lt;/a&gt;\". In one memorable incident of 14 February 1902, while he was hosting a literary festivity at the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Athenaeum\"&gt;Bucharest Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt;, Macedonski was heckled and responded by blowing a whistle. \"For\u0163a Moral\u0103\" was shut down soon after this episode. In parallel, the National Theater offered Caragiale a degree of satisfaction, when it decided to showcase \"Rabagas\", leaving the public to see that it was only remotely similar to his play.\nIn the wake of the scandal, Caragiale attempted to resume contacts with Maiorescu, and visited him several times. His former mentor was reticent, and finally rejected the offer for reconciliation \u2013 writing in his diary, he defined Caragiale's attempts as \"apple-polishings\" and \"parad\u0103ri\" (\"affectations\").\nMove to Berlin.\nHaving gained access to the Momulo Cardini inheritance, Caragiale became a rather wealthy man. According to &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Eerban%20Cioculescu\"&gt;\u015eerban Cioculescu&lt;/a&gt;, the writer soon lost most of the funds earned, transferring them to &lt;a href=\"Mateiu%20Caragiale\"&gt;Mateiu Caragiale&lt;/a&gt; and his mother, but was again made rich by the death of his sister Lenci in autumn 1905\u2014she left him the administrator of 160,000 &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20leu\"&gt;lei&lt;/a&gt;. The latter event caused tensions between Mateiu and his father\u2014Caragiale-son believed that he had been cheated out of the inheritance, and was angered by Ion Luca's decision to stop subsidizing him after he failed to complete his studies.\nHe was by then enchanted with the idea of moving into a &lt;a href=\"Western%20Europe\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central Europe&lt;/a&gt;an country, where he hoped to lead a more comfortable life and be closer to the centers of culture. He was especially interested in gaining easier access to the major stages for &lt;a href=\"classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt;, as a means to satisfy his desire for quality in that field (he had by then come to adore the compositions of &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven\"&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;). According to Tudor Vianu, Caragiale was also showing signs that he was about to enter a vaguely &lt;a href=\"misanthropic\"&gt;misanthropic&lt;/a&gt; phase of his life.\nIn 1903\u20131904, the Caragiales traveled through various European countries, while the dramatist again considered establishing his residence in Transylvania. They eventually moved to &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial German&lt;/a&gt; capital, settling down in spring 1905. The choice was considered unusual, since the writer knew only some basic &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; expressions. This has led some commentators to speculate that the move was politically motivated. &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Dragomirescu\"&gt;Mihail Dragomirescu&lt;/a&gt; believed that Caragiale was living at the expense of the German state. Cioculescu rejected this assessment, arguing that it relied on hearsay and pointing out that the chronological order provided by Dragomirescu was inaccurate. In 1992, historian Georgeta Ene proposed that Caragiale was acting as a spy for Romania in Germany.\nThe family lived in an apartment in &lt;a href=\"Wilmersdorf\"&gt;Wilmersdorf&lt;/a&gt; and later at a villa in &lt;a href=\"Sch%C3%B6neberg\"&gt;Sch\u00f6neberg&lt;/a&gt;. Paraphrasing a Romanian proverb which speaks of \"the black bread of exile\", the dramatist jokingly referred to his relocation as \"the white loaf\" (\"franzela alb\u0103 a surghiunului\"). He did not however isolate himself completely, becoming very close to the group of Romanian students attending the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;University of Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and to other young people: among them were poet and essayist &lt;a href=\"Panait%20Cerna\"&gt;Panait Cerna&lt;/a&gt;, sociologist &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20Gusti\"&gt;Dimitrie Gusti&lt;/a&gt;, musician &lt;a href=\"Florica%20Musicescu\"&gt;Florica Musicescu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Dobrogeanu-Gherea\"&gt;Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&lt;/a&gt;'s son-in-law, the literary critic &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Zarifopol\"&gt;Paul Zarifopol&lt;/a&gt;. Caragiale was also close to the linguist &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Weigand\"&gt;Gustav Weigand&lt;/a&gt;. He frequently traveled to &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;, where he would meet with Zarifopol, as well as vacationing in &lt;a href=\"Travem%C3%BCnde\"&gt;Travem\u00fcnde&lt;/a&gt;. In 1906, together with Zarifopol, he visited Beethoven's house in &lt;a href=\"Bonn\"&gt;Bonn&lt;/a&gt;. He was close to the dramatist &lt;a href=\"Ronetti%20Roman\"&gt;Ronetti Roman&lt;/a&gt;, and, in 1908, confessed that he was devastated by news of his death.\nCaragiale was also visited by &lt;a href=\"Barbu%20%C5%9Etef%C4%83nescu%20Delavrancea\"&gt;Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea&lt;/a&gt;, who, as a &lt;a href=\"Francophilia\"&gt;Francophile&lt;/a&gt;, vehemently rejected the aesthetics of Berlin in their conversations. Delavrancea was accompanied by his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Cella%20Delvrancea\"&gt;Cella&lt;/a&gt;, a celebrated pianist.\nHe also traveled back into Romania for intervals\u2014when in &lt;a href=\"Ia%C5%9Fi\"&gt;Ia\u015fi&lt;/a&gt;, he associated with the maverick Conservative &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20B%C4%83d%C4%83r%C4%83u\"&gt;Alexandru B\u0103d\u0103r\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; and his journal \"Opinia\". He had closely followed B\u0103d\u0103r\u0103u's career up to that point, and, in July 1906, authored an &lt;a href=\"epigram\"&gt;epigram&lt;/a&gt; on his ousting from the &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Grigore%20Cantacuzino\"&gt;Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino&lt;/a&gt; Conservative cabinet\u2014comparing B\u0103d\u0103r\u0103u to &lt;a href=\"Jonah\"&gt;Jonah&lt;/a&gt; and the Conservatives to a great fish that spat him out. A poem he published during the same year ridicules &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Romania\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carol%20I%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Carol I&lt;/a&gt; on the occasion of his fortieth year in power, while parodying the style of republican poet &lt;a href=\"N.%20T.%20Or%C4%83%C5%9Fanu\"&gt;N. T. Or\u0103\u015fanu&lt;/a&gt;; without making direct references to the monarch, it features the lyrics \"Ca rol fu mare, mititelul\" (\"Taking in view his role, he was grand, the little one\"), with \"ca\" and \"rol\" spelling out his name (and thus allowing the poem to read \"Carol was grand, the little one\"). He continued to publish various works in several other newspapers and magazines, including various Tranylvanian papers and the Ia\u015fi-based \"&lt;a href=\"Via%C5%A3a%20Rom%C3%A2neasc%C4%83\"&gt;Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHis subsequent work comprised mostly correspondence with other literary figures, such as Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Mihail Dragomirescu, &lt;a href=\"Alceu%20Urechia\"&gt;Alceu Urechia&lt;/a&gt;, and Zarifopol. He was also in touch with psychologist and philosopher &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20R%C4%83dulescu-Motru\"&gt;Constantin R\u0103dulescu-Motru&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Caragiale planned to start work on \"Titirc\u0103, Sotirescu et C-ie\", meaning to combine the characters of his two most successful comedies (\"&lt;a href=\"O%20noapte%20furtunoas%C4%83\"&gt;O noapte furtunoas\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"O%20scrisoare%20pierdut%C4%83\"&gt;O scrisoare pierdut\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\") into one play\u2014this was never accomplished.\n1907.\nIn 1907, Caragiale was shaken by the outbreak and violent repression of the &lt;a href=\"1907%20Romanian%20Peasants%27%20Revolt\"&gt;Romanian Peasants' Revolt&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to write a lengthy essay, in which he condemned the agrarian policies of both National Liberal and Conservative governments from a &lt;a href=\"Patriotism\"&gt;patriotic&lt;/a&gt; perspective. According to Vianu, the resulting \"1907, din prim\u0103var\u0103 p\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een toamn\u0103\" (\"1907, From Spring to Autumn\") was, alongside earlier essays by Eminescu and Maiorescu, the most important works of social analysis to be written by that generation.\nThe essay, written in harsh tones, listed what Caragiale saw as the major social problems tolerated by Romanian administrations: he discussed the landowning class, successor to the &lt;a href=\"boyar\"&gt;boyar&lt;/a&gt;s, having maintained as much possible from the legacy of &lt;a href=\"serfdom\"&gt;serfdom&lt;/a&gt;; he noted that, while the commerce was dominated by foreigners, the administration was gripped by a no longer aristocratic &lt;a href=\"oligarchy\"&gt;oligarchy&lt;/a&gt; and its far-reaching &lt;a href=\"political%20machine\"&gt;political machine&lt;/a&gt;. As several commentators noted, many of the topics brought up by Caragiale built on the critical overview adopted by \"Junimea\". To the social and political problems, the text offered a &lt;a href=\"Monarchism\"&gt;monarchist&lt;/a&gt; solution\u2014Caragiale expected Carol I to carry out a \"&lt;a href=\"coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;\" against the Romanian political establishment, replacing the &lt;a href=\"1866%20Constitution%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Constitution of 1866&lt;/a&gt;, which left some room for &lt;a href=\"Privilege%20%28legal%20ethics%29\"&gt;privilege&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"census%20suffrage\"&gt;census suffrage&lt;/a&gt;, with a more &lt;a href=\"Democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt; one.\n\"1907, din prim\u0103var\u0103 p\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een toamn\u0103\", first published in &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; under the pseudonym \"Ein rum\u00e4nische Patriot\" (\"A Romanian patriot\"), was originally hosted by the &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;-based newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Zeit%20%28Austria%29\"&gt;Die Zeit&lt;/a&gt;\". The translation had been completed by his friend &lt;a href=\"Mite%20Kremnitz\"&gt;Mite Kremnitz&lt;/a&gt;. In its original, the work was later printed under Caragiale's signature by the &lt;a href=\"left-wing\"&gt;left-wing&lt;/a&gt; Romanian journal \"&lt;a href=\"Adev%C4%83rul\"&gt;Adev\u0103rul&lt;/a&gt;\". The author had agreed to make himself known after \"Die Zeit\" reached Romania and had caused the local press to wonder who had condemned the system in such harsh words.\nThe brochure attracted instantaneous attention in his native country, and its success was notable: it sold around 13,000 copies. There were notable differences between the two versions, which were the result of Caragiale's answer to criticism and suggestions from &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Rakovsky\"&gt;Christian Rakovsky&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent &lt;a href=\"Proletarian%20internationalism\"&gt;internationalist&lt;/a&gt; socialist who had been expelled from Romania early in the year. Caragiale elaborated on some of the essay's themes in a series of &lt;a href=\"fable\"&gt;fable&lt;/a&gt;s he published soon after.\nThis chain of events prompted &lt;a href=\"Barbu%20%C5%9Etef%C4%83nescu%20Delavrancea\"&gt;Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea&lt;/a&gt; to offer him a position in the Conservative Party, as a means to reform the system from within. Caragiale rejected the offer: by then, he had grown disillusioned with the traditional political groupings, and had decided to sever all his links with them. Instead, in 1908, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Conservative-Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Conservative-Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, a rising force of the entrepreneurial &lt;a href=\"middle%20class\"&gt;middle class&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Take%20Ionescu\"&gt;Take Ionescu&lt;/a&gt;. He briefly returned to Romania several times after 1908, campaigning in favor of the Ionescu and being himself proposed for a seat in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; (before the Conservative-Democrats decided another person was more suited for the position). His involvement in politics engendered a collateral conflict with his son Mateiu, after the latter expressed a wish to become part of the administration (a project ridiculed by Caragiale-father).\nIn December 1907, after \"Opinia\" became a mouthpiece of Ionescu's party, Caragiale received news that its headquarters had been vandalized by &lt;a href=\"A.%20C.%20Cuza\"&gt;A. C. Cuza&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Nationalism\"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; supporters (who were students at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Ia%C5%9Fi\"&gt;University of Ia\u015fi&lt;/a&gt;). Just days after, when Cuza's group offered to host a Caragiale festival, he refused to participate, citing his respect for the &lt;a href=\"freedom%20of%20the%20press\"&gt;freedom of the press&lt;/a&gt;. It was also during the period that he published his \"&lt;a href=\"Din%20carnetul%20unui%20vechi%20sufleur\"&gt;Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur&lt;/a&gt;\", grouping short pieces about cultural figures such as &lt;a href=\"Iorgu%20Caragiale\"&gt;Iorgu Caragiale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pantazi%20Ghica\"&gt;Pantazi Ghica&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Matei%20Millo\"&gt;Matei Millo&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinal years.\nBeginning in 1909, Caragiale resumed his contributions to \"&lt;a href=\"Universul\"&gt;Universul&lt;/a&gt;\". The same year, his &lt;a href=\"Fantasy%20literature\"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; piece \"&lt;a href=\"Kir%20Ianulea\"&gt;Kir Ianulea&lt;/a&gt;\", which explored the &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20Bucharest\"&gt;history of Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; during the early 19th century and the late stages of the &lt;a href=\"Phanariotes\"&gt;Phanariote&lt;/a&gt; period, was published by \"&lt;a href=\"Via%C5%A3a%20Rom%C3%A2neasc%C4%83\"&gt;Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\". The novella partly built on \"&lt;a href=\"Belfagor%20arcidiavolo\"&gt;Belfagor arcidiavolo&lt;/a&gt;\", by &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20literature\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; author &lt;a href=\"Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli\"&gt;Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli&lt;/a&gt;, and was occasionally classified as an example of &lt;a href=\"historical%20fiction\"&gt;historical fiction&lt;/a&gt;. Similar stories use themes from the \"&lt;a href=\"One%20Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights\"&gt;One Thousand and One Nights&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Abu-Hasan\"&gt;Abu-Hasan&lt;/a&gt;\") and popular anecdotes (\"&lt;a href=\"Pastram%C4%83%20trufanda\"&gt;Pastram\u0103 trufanda&lt;/a&gt;\"). Another work of the time was \"&lt;a href=\"Calul%20dracului\"&gt;Calul dracului&lt;/a&gt;\", a rural-themed account of demonic temptation, which Vianu called \"one of the most perfect short stories to have been written in Romanian language\".\nHis last collection of writings, titled \"Schi\u0163e nou\u0103\" (\"New Sketches\") saw print in 1910. During that period, after giving endorsement to a project outlined by his fellow dramatist &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Davila\"&gt;Alexandru Davila&lt;/a&gt;, he aided in the creation of a new privately run Bucharest theater, and recorded its inauguration in his &lt;a href=\"reportage\"&gt;reportage&lt;/a&gt; \"\u00cencepem\" (\"We Begin\").\nBy that time, Ion Luca Caragiale became remarkably close to a new generation of ethnic Romanian intellectuals in &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. In 1909, he recalled the union of the two &lt;a href=\"Danubian%20Principalities\"&gt;Danubian Principalities&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20John%20Cuza\"&gt;Alexander John Cuza&lt;/a&gt;, and predicted the &lt;a href=\"union%20of%20Transylvania%20with%20Romania\"&gt;union of Transylvania with Romania&lt;/a&gt;. He visited &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Transylvanian students at the &lt;a href=\"E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s%20Lor%C3%A1nd%20University\"&gt;local university&lt;/a&gt;, and was the subject of a &lt;a href=\"PhD\"&gt;PhD&lt;/a&gt; thesis authored by &lt;a href=\"Horia%20Petra-Petrescu\"&gt;Horia Petra-Petrescu&lt;/a&gt; (which was also the first &lt;a href=\"monograph\"&gt;monograph&lt;/a&gt; on his work). He decided to support the poet and activist &lt;a href=\"Octavian%20Goga\"&gt;Octavian Goga&lt;/a&gt;, who, after questioning ethnic policies in &lt;a href=\"Transleithania\"&gt;Transleithania&lt;/a&gt;, had been jailed by &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; authorities\u2014writing for \"Universul\", Caragiale stressed that such persecutions carried the risk of escalating tensions in the region. Later, he visited Goga in &lt;a href=\"Szeged\"&gt;Szeged&lt;/a&gt;, where he was serving time in jail.\nCaragiale also contributed to the &lt;a href=\"Arad%2C%20Romania\"&gt;Arad&lt;/a&gt;-based journal \"Rom\u00e2nul\", becoming friends with other Romanian activists\u2014&lt;a href=\"Aurel%20Popovici\"&gt;Aurel Popovici&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Vaida-Voevod\"&gt;Alexandru Vaida-Voevod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Goldi%C5%9F\"&gt;Vasile Goldi\u015f&lt;/a&gt;. His articles expressed support for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Romanian%20Party\"&gt;National Romanian Party&lt;/a&gt;, calling for its adversaries at \"&lt;a href=\"Tribuna%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Tribuna&lt;/a&gt;\" to abandon their dissident politics. In August 1911, he was present in &lt;a href=\"Blaj\"&gt;Blaj&lt;/a&gt;, where the cultural association &lt;a href=\"Asocia%C5%A3ia%20Transilvan%C4%83%20pentru%20Literatura%20Rom%C3%A2n%C4%83%20%C5%9Fi%20Cultura%20Poporului%20Rom%C3%A2n\"&gt;ASTRA&lt;/a&gt; was celebrating its 50th year. Caragiale also witnessed one of the first aviation flights, that of the Romanian Transylvanian pioneer &lt;a href=\"Aurel%20Vlaicu\"&gt;Aurel Vlaicu&lt;/a&gt;. In January 1912, as he turned 60, Caragiale declined taking part in the formal celebration organized by &lt;a href=\"Emil%20G%C3%A2rleanu\"&gt;Emil G\u00e2rleanu&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Writers%27%20Society\"&gt;Romanian Writers' Society&lt;/a&gt;. Caragiale had previously rejected &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20R%C4%83dulescu-Motru\"&gt;Constantin R\u0103dulescu-Motru&lt;/a&gt;'s offer to carry out a public subscription in his favor, arguing that he could not accept such financial gains.\nHe died suddenly at his home in Berlin, very soon after returning from his trip. The cause of death was indicated as &lt;a href=\"myocardial%20infarction\"&gt;myocardial infarction&lt;/a&gt;. His son &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Caragiale\"&gt;Luca&lt;/a&gt; recounted that, on that very night, Caragiale-father was rereading &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Macbeth\"&gt;Macbeth&lt;/a&gt;\", which he found to be a moving narrative.\nCaragiale's body was transported to Bucharest in a freight train, which lost its way on the tracks and arrived with a major delay. He was eventually buried in &lt;a href=\"Bellu%20cemetery\"&gt;Bellu cemetery&lt;/a&gt; on 22 November 1912. His longtime rival &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Macedonski\"&gt;Alexandru Macedonski&lt;/a&gt; was saddened by the news of his death, and, in a letter to \"&lt;a href=\"Adev%C4%83rul\"&gt;Adev\u0103rul&lt;/a&gt;\", argued that he preferred Caragiale's humor to that of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Twain\"&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/a&gt;, stressing that \"[w]e attacked each other often because we loved each other a lot.\"\nStyle and cultural tenets.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20Vianu\"&gt;Tudor Vianu&lt;/a&gt;, Caragiale's writings signify \"the highest expression\" of &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian theater&lt;/a&gt;, mirroring and complimenting the contribution &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Eminescu\"&gt;Mihai Eminescu&lt;/a&gt; had to Romanian-language poetry. Vianu nonetheless pointed out the immense difference in style and approach between the Eminescu and Caragiale, noting that, to Eminescu's &lt;a href=\"Metaphysics\"&gt;metaphysical&lt;/a&gt; interests and \"&lt;a href=\"Romanticism\"&gt;Romantic&lt;/a&gt; genius\", the dramatist opposed his \"great classical and realist endowment, a social, voluble and &lt;a href=\"Epicureanism\"&gt;epicurean&lt;/a&gt; nature\".\nCritics and historians place Caragiale's style midway between the delayed &lt;a href=\"Classicism\"&gt;Classicism&lt;/a&gt; of 19th century &lt;a href=\"Literature%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian literature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Literary%20realism\"&gt;Realism&lt;/a&gt; (with its \"&lt;a href=\"fin%20de%20si%C3%A8cle\"&gt;fin de si\u00e8cle&lt;/a&gt;\" development, &lt;a href=\"Naturalism%20%28literature%29\"&gt;Naturalism&lt;/a&gt;). The writer, who abided by the &lt;a href=\"classical%20unities\"&gt;classical unities&lt;/a&gt;, rejected Romantic tenets, and, as early as the 1870s, opposed the &lt;a href=\"lyricism\"&gt;lyricism&lt;/a&gt; present in the dramas of &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Hugo\"&gt;Victor Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Schiller\"&gt;Friedrich Schiller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Neoclassicism\"&gt;Neoclassicism&lt;/a&gt; in his works is further enhanced in his drama and comedies by his adherence to &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20Scribe\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne Scribe&lt;/a&gt;'s principles (\"see &lt;a href=\"Well-made%20play\"&gt;Well-made play&lt;/a&gt;\"). &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Zarifopol\"&gt;Paul Zarifopol&lt;/a&gt; argued that, for most of his life, Caragiale, the opponent of &lt;a href=\"didacticism\"&gt;didacticism&lt;/a&gt;, advocated Maiorescu's principles of &lt;a href=\"art%20for%20art%27s%20sake\"&gt;art for art's sake&lt;/a&gt;. He often sketched out alternative endings to his stories, and selected the ones he felt came most natural. Nevertheless, Zarifopol also noted that, late in his life, the writer contemplated adding a didactic message to one of his writings, which was to remain unfinished.\nHis role in the Romanian context was likened to those of &lt;a href=\"Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac\"&gt;Honor\u00e9 de Balzac&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Dickens\"&gt;Charles Dickens&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Gogol\"&gt;Nikolai Gogol&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Literary critic &lt;a href=\"Pompiliu%20Constantinescu\"&gt;Pompiliu Constantinescu&lt;/a&gt; credited Caragiale's sense of irony with having corrected the tendencies of his day, and, through this, with helping create an urban literature. Caragiale's interest in Realism was however denied by some of his \"Junimist\" advocates, who attempted to link his entire work with Maiorescu's guidelines: on the basis of &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Schopenhauer%27s%20aesthetics\"&gt;Schopenhauerian aesthetics&lt;/a&gt;, critic &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Dragomirescu\"&gt;Mihail Dragomirescu&lt;/a&gt; postulated that his humor was pure, and did not draw on any special circumstance or context.\nThrough many of his traits, Caragiale was connected to a &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkan&lt;/a&gt; environment of virtually permanent human contact, with its humor condensed in &lt;a href=\"anecdote\"&gt;anecdote&lt;/a&gt;s, mimicry, and witty comebacks. Zarifopol quoted him saying that he admired the traditional forms of entertainment, and that he admired the \"soitar\u00eci\" (\"&lt;a href=\"buffoon\"&gt;buffoon&lt;/a&gt;s\").\nLargely reflecting his primordial study of &lt;a href=\"dramaturgy\"&gt;dramaturgy&lt;/a&gt;, Caragiale's literature is indebted to dialog, as well as, in rarer cases, to &lt;a href=\"internal%20monologue\"&gt;internal monologue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"free%20indirect%20speech\"&gt;free indirect speech&lt;/a&gt; (the favorite technique of Naturalists). Language takes the central role in his work, often compensating for the lack of detail. To this was added his tendency to reduce texts to their essence\u2014he shortened down not only his own text, but also his occasional translations of stories by &lt;a href=\"Elisabeth%20of%20Wied\"&gt;Queen Elisabeth&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20de%20Cervantes\"&gt;Miguel de Cervantes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Allan%20Poe\"&gt;Edgar Allan Poe&lt;/a&gt;. At times, he added a lyrical, meditative or autobiographical, perspective to his works: this trait was especially obvious in his later &lt;a href=\"fantasy\"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; works (\"&lt;a href=\"Kir%20Ianulea\"&gt;Kir Ianulea&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Calul%20dracului\"&gt;Calul dracului&lt;/a&gt;\" among them), all marked by &lt;a href=\"Neo-romanticism\"&gt;Neoromantic&lt;/a&gt; inspiration. Zarifopol claimed that, although Caragiale often rejected the tendency of other writers to capitalize on &lt;a href=\"picturesque\"&gt;picturesque&lt;/a&gt; images, he often used them in his own writings.\nCaragiale arguably won as much acclaim for his rigorous approach to playwriting as for his accomplished style. With &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Vlahu%C5%A3%C4%83\"&gt;Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Co%C5%9Fbuc\"&gt;George Co\u015fbuc&lt;/a&gt; and others, he belonged to the first generation of Romanian authors to take a noted interest in imposing &lt;a href=\"professionalism\"&gt;professionalism&lt;/a&gt;. He was specific about this requirement\u2014on one occasion, he used sarcasm to overturn a common misconception, saying: \"Literature is an art that needs not be learned; whoever knows how to turn letters into syllables and the latter into words has had sufficient preparation to engage in literature.\" Commenting on this, Vianu stressed: \"[...] even under the appearance of ease, [Caragiale] lets us catch sight of the severe law of his art\" (adding elsewhere that \"[Caragiale] was a scrupulous and tormented artist\").\nCaragiale compared writers who could not dissimulate their intent and generate a good story with \"a &lt;a href=\"Strabismus\"&gt;cross-eyed&lt;/a&gt; who tells you which way to go: one doesn't known if he is to go down the road he points to, or down the road he is looking at\". Speaking in the late 1890s, he also likened writing for the stage with &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"In truth, just as much as the architect's plan is not yet the final accomplishment of his intent\u2014that is to say, the monument\u2014but only its conventional recording [...], so too is the dramaturg's writing not yet the accomplishment of his intent\u2014that is to say, the comedy\u2014but the conventional recording, to which will be added the personal elements, in order to depict a development of human circumstances and deeds. In short: just as an architect's plan bears little resemblance to a painting, so does drama bear little resemblance to a poem.\"\nPolitical and social vision.\nLiberalism and republicanism.\nHis interest in first-hand investigation of the human nature was accompanied, at least after he reached maturity, by a distaste for generous and &lt;a href=\"Universalism\"&gt;universalist&lt;/a&gt; theories. Caragiale viewed their impact on Romanian society with a critical eye. Like \"&lt;a href=\"Junimea\"&gt;Junimea&lt;/a&gt;\", he was amused by the cultural legacy of &lt;a href=\"Wallachian%20Revolution%20of%201848\"&gt;1848 Wallachian revolutionaries&lt;/a&gt;, and by its image in National Liberal discourse. Nevertheless, he claimed that there was a clear difference between the first generation of &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20and%20radicalism%20in%20Romania\"&gt;liberal activists&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Ion%20C%C3%A2mpineanu\"&gt;Ion C\u00e2mpineanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Heliade%20R%C4%83dulescu\"&gt;Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20B%C4%83lcescu\"&gt;Nicolae B\u0103lcescu&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and the new liberal establishment, which, as he believed, had come to cultivate &lt;a href=\"hypocrisy\"&gt;hypocrisy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"demagogy\"&gt;demagogy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"political%20corruption\"&gt;political corruption&lt;/a&gt;. He exemplified the latter group by citing some of its prominent members: &lt;a href=\"Pantazi%20Ghica\"&gt;Pantazi Ghica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Misail\"&gt;Nicolae Misail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20P%C4%83t%C3%A2rl%C4%83geanu\"&gt;Mihail P\u0103t\u00e2rl\u0103geanu&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, he argued that, had they not died young, the leaders of 1848 could have found themselves best represented by the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201880%E2%80%931918%29\"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;. He recorded the way in which National Liberal politicians claimed to take inspiration from the revolt, and pointed out that the 1848 slogans had become rallying calls for the most banal causes.\nHis almost lifelong critique of the liberal current, marked by his conflicts with &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20Sturdza\"&gt;Dimitrie Sturdza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Petriceicu%20Hasdeu\"&gt;Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu&lt;/a&gt;, was partly inspired by \"Junimea\"'s guidelines\u2014in line with the \"Junimists\", Caragiale perceived liberals as agents of &lt;a href=\"Populism\"&gt;Populism&lt;/a&gt;, popular Romanticism, and &lt;a href=\"Idealism\"&gt;Idealism&lt;/a&gt;, as tenets prevalent in the literature of his day. For Caragiale, the resulting liberal-inspired literary works were \"spanac\" (\"&lt;a href=\"spinach\"&gt;spinach&lt;/a&gt;\"). The writer thus identified late 19th-century Romanian liberalism \"empty talk\", and his attacks on demagogy partly mirrored Maiorescu's views about the National Liberals' \"inebriation with words\".\nCaragiale centered some of his first attacks on the \"Reds\" and their leader &lt;a href=\"C.%20A.%20Rosetti\"&gt;C. A. Rosetti&lt;/a&gt;, in whose &lt;a href=\"republicanism\"&gt;republicanism&lt;/a&gt; and inflammatory rhetoric he saw the main threat to Romanian society. The writer believed that, ever since having ousted &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20John%20Cuza\"&gt;Alexander John Cuza&lt;/a&gt; from his throne, both Rosetti and &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Br%C4%83tianu\"&gt;Ion Br\u0103tianu&lt;/a&gt; were using their republican basis as an asset, inciting to rebellion only when their demands were not met. He frequently ridiculed the cult with which Rosetti surrounded figures of international republicanism, such as &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Garibaldi\"&gt;Giuseppe Garibaldi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9on%20Gambetta\"&gt;L\u00e9on Gambetta&lt;/a&gt;, and indicated that the National Liberal public had very vague and impractical notions of what a republican state actually implied.\nThe republican agitation is no longer emphasized in Caragiale's later works, as republicanism slowly faded out of the mainstream liberal discourse. Noting this, several critics believe that, in his \"&lt;a href=\"O%20scrisoare%20pierdut%C4%83\"&gt;O scrisoare pierdut\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", which depicts the battle between two unnamed political camps, the dramatist alluded to the conflict between Br\u0103tianu's moderates and Rosetti's extremists (as indicated by the fact that all the main characters attend the same rallies). This view was disputed by Zarifopol, who argued that the more pragmatic grouping stands for the Conservatives, and the demagogic one for the National Liberals as a whole.\nNationalism.\nIon Luca Caragiale was a vocal critic of &lt;a href=\"antisemitism\"&gt;antisemitism&lt;/a&gt;, which was mostly represented by the National Liberals and &lt;a href=\"A.%20C.%20Cuza\"&gt;A. C. Cuza&lt;/a&gt;'s emerging movement. At a time when the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Jewish community&lt;/a&gt; was denied &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Emancipation\"&gt;emancipation&lt;/a&gt;, he advocated its full integration into Romanian society, calling for &lt;a href=\"civil%20rights\"&gt;civil rights&lt;/a&gt; to be extended to all residents of Romania. Around 1907, he tried his hand at writing a legislative proposal, according to which the Romanian state was to extend citizenship all resident &lt;a href=\"stateless%20person\"&gt;stateless person&lt;/a&gt;s who did not enjoy foreign protection\u2014in its manuscript form, this document was kept by his friend &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20Gusti\"&gt;Dimitrie Gusti&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Garabet%20Ibr%C4%83ileanu\"&gt;Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu&lt;/a&gt;, his rejection of antisemitic views was owed either to his failure to relate with the &lt;a href=\"middle%20class\"&gt;middle class&lt;/a&gt; and its anti-Jewish stances, or to his \"powerful intelligence\", which contrasted with the \"instinctual, almost zoological nature\" of the antisemitic discourse.\nHis criticism of both the nationalist discourse and liberal-inspired education generated subjects for several of his shorter satirical writings. Caragiale thus authored a mock-pamphlet advertising the program of a new cultural society, \"&lt;a href=\"Rom%C3%A2nii%20Verzi\"&gt;Rom\u00e2nii Verzi&lt;/a&gt;\" (the \"Green Romanians\"), who took its &lt;a href=\"Racism\"&gt;racialist&lt;/a&gt; proposals to the point of arguing that \"[...] a nation must always fear other nations\". Like \"Junimea\", he was entirely opposed to the group of &lt;a href=\"August%20Treboniu%20Laurian\"&gt;August Treboniu Laurian&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;n intellectuals, who attempted to reform the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian language&lt;/a&gt; by introducing new forms of speech and writing that aimed to return it closer to its &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; roots. In his stories, Caragiale created the teacher &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Chico%C5%9F%20Rostogan\"&gt;Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan&lt;/a&gt;, a caricature of both the liberal educators and the Transylvanian \"Latinists\". While in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, the writer also persiflaged some of &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Alecsandri\"&gt;Vasile Alecsandri&lt;/a&gt;'s liberal and &lt;a href=\"Patriotism\"&gt;patriotic&lt;/a&gt; writings\u2014he completed Alecsandri's nationalist poem \"Tricolorul\" with sarcastic verses that were meant to enhance its &lt;a href=\"Xenophobia\"&gt;xenophobic&lt;/a&gt; feel (showing the Romanians ready to do battle against all their perceived enemies in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;).\nNevertheless, various authors believe that a young Caragiale did indeed support nationalist liberal policies, and presume that he was behind a series of anti-Jewish columns, published by \"&lt;a href=\"Voin%C5%A3a%20Na%C5%A3ional%C4%83\"&gt;Voin\u0163a Na\u0163ional\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\" during the early 1880s. This was for long disputed: &lt;a href=\"rabbi\"&gt;rabbi&lt;/a&gt; and literary historian &lt;a href=\"Moses%20Gaster\"&gt;Moses Gaster&lt;/a&gt; attributed the pieces to &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Xenopol\"&gt;Nicolae Xenopol&lt;/a&gt;, while researcher &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Eerban%20Cioculescu\"&gt;\u015eerban Cioculescu&lt;/a&gt;, who originally doubted them, eventually agreed that they formed an integral part of Caragiale's work.\nConservatism and traditionalism.\nIn some of his early articles, and again as he distanced himself from \"Junimea\", the writer showed himself to be a vocal critic of the Conservative doctrine and its \"Junimist\" representatives. This is especially evident in his 1907 essay and in some of his stories. Caragiale claimed that both &lt;a href=\"Titu%20Maiorescu\"&gt;Titu Maiorescu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Petre%20P.%20Carp\"&gt;Petre P. Carp&lt;/a&gt; were \"&lt;a href=\"boyar\"&gt;boyar&lt;/a&gt;s\" who prioritized the interest of their &lt;a href=\"social%20class\"&gt;social class&lt;/a&gt; (which was by then nonetheless defunct, as traditional &lt;a href=\"Privilege%20%28legal%20ethics%29\"&gt;privilege&lt;/a&gt; had been formally abolished a generation earlier). Cioculescu attributed this to an \"&lt;a href=\"inferiority%20complex\"&gt;inferiority complex&lt;/a&gt;\" Caragiale felt in respect to his former patrons.\nDespite his brief association with the mainstream Conservatives, Caragiale was probably never their partisan, and only hoped that the party could open the way for the reforms advertised by &lt;a href=\"George%20Panu\"&gt;George Panu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Lahovari\"&gt;Alexandru Lahovari&lt;/a&gt;. When disappointed with their failure to promote change, he moved on to support &lt;a href=\"Take%20Ionescu\"&gt;Take Ionescu&lt;/a&gt; and his dissident grouping. Uniquely among students of Caragiale's work, &lt;a href=\"George%20C%C4%83linescu\"&gt;George C\u0103linescu&lt;/a&gt; argued that the writer's main interest was not in criticizing the liberals, but actually in an overall rejection of the most embedded \"Junimist\" tenets, which, in C\u0103linescu's view, had engendered \"a lack of faith in the country's own powers\". &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Zarifopol\"&gt;Paul Zarifopol&lt;/a&gt; believed that several of his \"&lt;a href=\"Momente%20%C5%9Fi%20schi%C5%A3e\"&gt;Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e&lt;/a&gt;\" characters, including the effeminate high life chronicler Edgar Bostandaki, are caricatures of the Conservatives.\nCaragiale contrasted the other major writers of his generation, including his friends Mihai Eminescu, &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Slavici\"&gt;Ioan Slavici&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbu%20%C5%9Etef%C4%83nescu%20Delavrancea\"&gt;Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea&lt;/a&gt;, and \"&lt;a href=\"S%C4%83m%C4%83n%C4%83torul\"&gt;S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul&lt;/a&gt;\" journal founder &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Vlahu%C5%A3%C4%83\"&gt;Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom were advocating a return to the rural sphere and peasant traditionalism. In \"&lt;a href=\"Moftul%20Rom%C3%A2n\"&gt;Moftul Rom\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt;\", he &lt;a href=\"Parody\"&gt;parodied&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"archaism\"&gt;archaism&lt;/a&gt;s favored by \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea; during his final years, he also questioned the aesthetic value of \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea's medieval-themed play \"&lt;a href=\"Apus%20de%20soare\"&gt;Apus de soare&lt;/a&gt;\". Prominent nationalists and traditionalists tended to be reserved in their assessment of Caragiale's literary contributions\u2014they include his friend Eminescu and historian &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Iorga\"&gt;Nicolae Iorga&lt;/a&gt;.\nNonetheless, Ion Luca Caragiale was, according to Zarifopol, a passionate advocate of tradition in front of innovation, and \"a defender of the well-established truths\". &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20Vianu\"&gt;Tudor Vianu&lt;/a&gt; also evidenced that Caragiale treasured his &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; identity, frequently appealing to God and the saints in both his private life and his writings. According to &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Slavici\"&gt;Ioan Slavici&lt;/a&gt;, Caragiale defined himself as \"a right-believing &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;\", and disagreed with Eminescu on the nature of religion (at a time when the poet was a passionate student of &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;). Cioculescu called this trait \"primitive religiosity\". The writer is also known to have convinced that &lt;a href=\"luck\"&gt;luck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"destiny\"&gt;destiny&lt;/a&gt; manifested themselves in life, and his \"&lt;a href=\"C%C4%83nu%C5%A3%C4%83%20om%20sucit\"&gt;C\u0103nu\u0163\u0103 om sucit&lt;/a&gt;\", a short story about a proverbially unlucky fellow, is thought to have referred to its author. His &lt;a href=\"superstition\"&gt;superstition&lt;/a&gt;s were accompanied by a series of &lt;a href=\"phobia\"&gt;phobia&lt;/a&gt;s, particularly &lt;a href=\"pyrophobia\"&gt;pyrophobia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nosophobia\"&gt;nosophobia&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaragiale and the modernists.\nIon Luca Caragiale was mostly critical of literary experiments and the newer stages of &lt;a href=\"Modernism\"&gt;Modernism&lt;/a&gt;. On this basis, he persistently ridiculed &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Macedonski\"&gt;Alexandru Macedonski&lt;/a&gt;'s style, especially after the latter adopted &lt;a href=\"Symbolism%20%28arts%29\"&gt;Symbolism&lt;/a&gt;. Much of his own poetry, especially pieces published in \"&lt;a href=\"Moftul%20Rom%C3%A2n\"&gt;Moftul Rom\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt;\" after 1901, parodied the &lt;a href=\"Symbolist%20movement%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian Symbolist clubs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Parnassianism\"&gt;Parnassianism&lt;/a&gt; of Macedonski's \"&lt;a href=\"Literatorul\"&gt;Literatorul&lt;/a&gt;\" (among the best-known of these targets was poet &lt;a href=\"Cincinat%20Pavelescu\"&gt;Cincinat Pavelescu&lt;/a&gt;, who was coeditor at \"Literatorul\").\nAs editor of \"&lt;a href=\"Epoca%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Epoca&lt;/a&gt;\"'s literary supplement, Caragiale refused to publish a descriptive poem by the young &lt;a href=\"Gala%20Galaction\"&gt;Gala Galaction&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it was not poetry (when &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Filipescu\"&gt;Nicolae Filipescu&lt;/a&gt; asked him to reconsider, he threatened to quit). Late in his life, he reserved explicit criticism for the new generation of Symbolists, whose work, he argued, belonged to \"the church\" of &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; poet &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Maeterlinck\"&gt;Maurice Maeterlinck&lt;/a&gt;. Zarifopol also noted that, for as long as he lived, the writer derided the innovative works of &lt;a href=\"Henrik%20Ibsen\"&gt;Henrik Ibsen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"August%20Strindberg\"&gt;August Strindberg&lt;/a&gt;, but pointed out that Caragiale had never actually read or seen their plays.\nNevertheless, Caragiale was not entirely opposed to newer trends in poetry and art. Literary critic &lt;a href=\"Matei%20C%C4%83linescu\"&gt;Matei C\u0103linescu&lt;/a&gt; believes that he genuinely admired \"\u00cen ora\u015ful cu trei sute de biserici\" (\"In the City with Three Hundred Churches\"), a &lt;a href=\"free%20verse\"&gt;free verse&lt;/a&gt; poem by the Symbolist &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Minulescu\"&gt;Ion Minulescu&lt;/a&gt;. This work is believed to have inspired a 1908 parody by Caragiale, in which the writer proclaimed his support for Take Ionescu. According to poet and essayist &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20Arghezi\"&gt;Tudor Arghezi&lt;/a&gt;, Caragiale also admired the works of &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Etefan%20Luchian\"&gt;\u015etefan Luchian&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Postimpressionism\"&gt;Postimpressionist&lt;/a&gt; whose paintings were often exhibited in Bucharest galleries.\nCaragiale and the Left.\nMoving toward the &lt;a href=\"Left-wing%20politics\"&gt;Left&lt;/a&gt; during the final decades of his life, the writer maintained connection with the &lt;a href=\"Socialism\"&gt;socialists&lt;/a&gt;, but was nonetheless ambivalent to their goals. As Cioculescu noted, he welcomed the Bucharest celebration of &lt;a href=\"May%20Day\"&gt;May Day&lt;/a&gt; in one of his \"&lt;a href=\"Moftul%20Rom%C3%A2n\"&gt;Moftul Rom\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt;\" pieces, and probably agreed to lecture for the Workers' Club in the capital. Some of his writings were hosted by the socialist journal \"&lt;a href=\"Rom%C3%A2nia%20Muncitoare\"&gt;Rom\u00e2nia Muncitoare&lt;/a&gt;\". According to &lt;a href=\"Garabet%20Ibr%C4%83ileanu\"&gt;Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu&lt;/a&gt;, himself a socialist at the time, \"sometime after 1890, Caragiale briefly flirted with socialism.\"\nHowever, over the same period, Caragiale ridiculed several socialist militants, referring to one of their leaders with the derisive nickname \"Edgard Spanachidi\" (itself a derivative of \"spinach\"). Instead, his loose association with &lt;a href=\"George%20Panu\"&gt;George Panu&lt;/a&gt; signified a return to &lt;a href=\"Radicalism%20%28historical%29\"&gt;radicalism&lt;/a&gt;, and saw him campaigning in favor of &lt;a href=\"universal%20suffrage\"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt; and a complete &lt;a href=\"land%20reform\"&gt;land reform&lt;/a&gt;\u2014this clashed with the views he had expressed earlier in life, and Caragiale was careful not to let it seem that he had returned to the \"Red\" liberalism of his youth.\nIn one of his articles, Ion Luca Caragiale commented with irony on the &lt;a href=\"Marxism\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; views of his friend &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Dobrogeanu-Gherea\"&gt;Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&lt;/a&gt;: he compared the latter's way of dining on a leg of veal, laboriously carving it into sections, to his philosophical approach. Caragiale thus noted that &lt;a href=\"philosophical%20skepticism\"&gt;philosophical skepticism&lt;/a&gt; was equivalent to stripping the bone of its flesh piece by piece, and then throwing it to the dogs\u2014without having been able to fully document the leg of veal or its substance. Nevertheless, as Tudor Vianu indicated, although Caragiale preferred observation and spontaneity to speculation, he was not averse to pure philosophical analysis, and frequently quoted the &lt;a href=\"classics\"&gt;classics&lt;/a&gt; in defense of his aesthetic guidelines. Late in his life, Caragiale also sparked debates after deriding the emerging &lt;a href=\"Poporanism\"&gt;Poporanism&lt;/a&gt;, a school of thought which took its inspiration from socialism, &lt;a href=\"agrarianism\"&gt;agrarianism&lt;/a&gt; and traditionalism. He is also known to have been amused by the &lt;a href=\"1907%20German%20federal%20election\"&gt;German election of 1907&lt;/a&gt; and the resulting defeat registered by the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaragiale maintained a friendship with Dobrogeanu-Gherea for much of his life. He was especially interested in news of Dobrogeanu-Gherea having become involved in the 1905 &lt;a href=\"Russian%20battleship%20Potemkin\"&gt;Russian battleship Potemkin&lt;/a&gt; scandal, after the aging socialist decided to offer his help to the refugee sailors as they arrived in &lt;a href=\"Constan%C5%A3a\"&gt;Constan\u0163a&lt;/a&gt;. During his time in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, he repeatedly tried to convince the Dobrogeanu-Ghereas to leave their home in Romania and join him abroad. Nonetheless, he criticized the philosopher when the latter refused to be decorated by &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Romania\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carol%20I%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Carol I&lt;/a&gt; (1909). Around 1907, the dramatist was also interested in the activities of &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Rakovsky\"&gt;Christian Rakovsky&lt;/a&gt;, who was trying to make his way back into Romania, and closely followed news of street clashes between his supporters and the authorities.\nSettings.\nThe writer had an unprecedented familiarity with the social environments, traits, opinions, manners of speech, means of expression and lifestyle choices of his day\u2014from the rural atmosphere of his early childhood, going through his vast experience as a journalist, to the high spheres of politics (&lt;a href=\"National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201875%29\"&gt;National Liberal&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28Romania%2C%201880%E2%80%931918%29\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;, \"Junimist\" as well as socialist). An incessant traveler, Caragiale carefully investigated everyday life in most areas of the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Old%20Kingdom\"&gt;Romanian Old Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and Transylvania. He was an unusually sociable man: in one of his letters from &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, he asked &lt;a href=\"Alceu%20Urechia\"&gt;Alceu Urechia&lt;/a&gt; to send his regards to over 40 of his acquaintances in &lt;a href=\"Sinaia\"&gt;Sinaia&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; diplomats to street vendors or beggars).\nSeveral of his major works have a rural setting\u2014they include \"&lt;a href=\"N%C4%83pasta\"&gt;N\u0103pasta&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"%C3%8En%20vreme%20de%20r%C4%83zboi\"&gt;\u00cen vreme de r\u0103zboi&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"La%20hanul%20lui%20M%C3%A2njoal%C4%83\"&gt;La hanul lui M\u00e2njoal\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Calul%20dracului\"&gt;Calul dracului&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"P%C4%83cat\"&gt;P\u0103cat&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"O%20f%C4%83clie%20de%20Pa%C5%9Fte\"&gt;O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as fragments of the pseudo-&lt;a href=\"fairy%20tale\"&gt;fairy tale&lt;/a&gt;s he authored late in life. Nevertheless, Caragiale is foremost known and acclaimed for his urban themes, which form the background to the vast majority of his most accomplished writings.\nThe author depicted the city in all stages of its development and in all its atmospheres\u2014from nightlife to \"&lt;a href=\"C%C4%83ldur%C4%83%20mare\"&gt;C\u0103ldur\u0103 mare&lt;/a&gt;\"'s midday torpor, from noisy &lt;a href=\"slum\"&gt;slum&lt;/a&gt;s and the \"T\u00e2rgul Mo\u015filor\" &lt;a href=\"fair\"&gt;fair&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Obor\"&gt;Obor&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;-inspired &lt;a href=\"tea%20party%20%28social%20gathering%29\"&gt;tea parties&lt;/a&gt; of the urban elite. This large fresco drew comparisons with his generation colleague &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Creang%C4%83\"&gt;Ion Creang\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, who was argued to have done the same for the countryside. Caragiale was especially proud of the opening paragraph in his \"Ultima emisiune...\" story, part of \"&lt;a href=\"Momente%20%C5%9Fi%20schi%C5%A3e\"&gt;Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e&lt;/a&gt;\", which, he believed, the \"corner of a slum\" was suggested to perfection.\n&lt;a href=\"Tudor%20Vianu\"&gt;Tudor Vianu&lt;/a&gt; also noted that, among cities and towns, Caragiale preferred Bucharest and those provincial centers most exposed to &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central Europe&lt;/a&gt;an influences (specifically, the summer retreats in the &lt;a href=\"Prahova%20Valley\"&gt;Prahova Valley&lt;/a&gt; and other Wallachian stations on the way to Transylvania). The enclosed world of the &lt;a href=\"C%C4%83ile%20Ferate%20Rom%C3%A2ne\"&gt;Romanian Railways&lt;/a&gt; also appealed to the writer, and an impressive number of his sketches relate to it in various ways.\nCollective characters.\nConfessing at some point that \"the world was my school\", Caragiale dissimulated his background and critical eye as a means to blend into each environment he encountered, and even adopted the manners and speech patterns he later recorded in his literary work. He thus encouraged familiarity, allowing people to reveal their histories, motivations, and culture. Vianu recounted: \"The man was a consummate actor and a \"&lt;a href=\"Deadpan\"&gt;pince-sans-rire&lt;/a&gt;\", an ironist [...] to the point where his partners of dialog were never sure if they were spoken to 'seriously' [...].\" In one of his pieces from 1899, he welcomed the famous actors &lt;a href=\"Eleonora%20Duse\"&gt;Eleonora Duse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Mounet-Sully\"&gt;Jean Mounet-Sully&lt;/a&gt; to Bucharest, imitating the exaggerated style of other theater chroniclers\u2014the article ended with Caragiale confessing that he had not actually seen the two perform. In one other instance, as a means to comment on &lt;a href=\"plagiarism\"&gt;plagiarism&lt;/a&gt;, the author also parodied his own \"O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte\"\u2014which he turned into the sketch, \"Noaptea \u00cenvierii\".\nIn \"1907, din prim\u0103var\u0103 p\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een toamn\u0103\", his late and disillusioned work, Caragiale lashed out at the traditional class of political clients, with an indictment which, Tudor Vianu believed, also served to identify the main focus of his other writings:\n\"plebs incapable of work and lacking employment, impoverished suburban small traders and street vendors, petty dangerous agitators of the villages and of the areas adjacent to towns, bullying election agents; and then the hybrid product of all levels of schooling, semi-cultured intellectuals, lawyers and lawyerlings, professors, teachers and teacherlings, semi-illiterate and unfrocked priests, illiterate schoolteachers\u2014all of them beer garden theorists; next come the great functionaries and the little clerks, most of them removable from office.\"\nDirect criticism was nonetheless rare in Caragiale's fiction: Vianu believed to have found traces of it in \"&lt;a href=\"O%20scrisoare%20pierdut%C4%83\"&gt;O scrisoare pierdut\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"the most cruel [of his satires]\") and in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hotel%20%26quot%3BVictoria%20rom%C3%A2n%C4%83%26quot%3B\"&gt;Grand Hotel \"Victoria rom\u00e2n\u0103\"&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"the most bitter\"). On several occasions, Caragiale showed or even defined himself as a sentimental, and his modesty was acknowledged by several of his friends. Vianu noted that, alongside his Christian &lt;a href=\"ethos\"&gt;ethos&lt;/a&gt;, this contributed to his distant, calm and often sympathetic overall take on society. In his words:\n\"A wave of charm, of reconciliation with life passes above all [his characters], one which, if it only assumes light and superficial shapes, experienced by naive people with harmless manias, is a sign that the collective existence is taking place in shelter from the great trials.\"\nIn contrast with this, &lt;a href=\"Poporanism\"&gt;Poporanist&lt;/a&gt; critic &lt;a href=\"Garabet%20Ibr%C4%83ileanu\"&gt;Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu&lt;/a&gt; argued that Caragiale actually hated the people who inspired his works, and claimed that the writer had made this clear during one of their conversations. His account was considered doubtful by researcher &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Etefan%20Cazimir\"&gt;\u015etefan Cazimir&lt;/a&gt;, who believed that Ibr\u0103ileanu was using it to back a polemic and singular overview of Caragiale's work.\nAccording to Vianu, there is a manifest difference between Ion Luca Caragiale's comedies and his \"&lt;a href=\"Momente%20%C5%9Fi%20schi%C5%A3e\"&gt;Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e&lt;/a&gt;\": the former are, in his view, driven by situations and circumstances, whereas the latter sees Caragiale developing his original perspective to its fullest. This, he argues, was determined by important social changes\u2014a move from a traditional world\u2014awkwardly attempting to digest &lt;a href=\"Westernization\"&gt;Westernization&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"modernization\"&gt;modernization&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Francization\"&gt;Francized&lt;/a&gt; culture\u2014, to a more stable and prosperous environment. A similar division was applied by Ibr\u0103ileanu.\nTypes.\nTheoretical aspects.\nThe form of &lt;a href=\"Literary%20realism\"&gt;Realism&lt;/a&gt; favored by Caragiale placed types of characters at the center of literary creativity, owing to the influence of &lt;a href=\"Classicism\"&gt;Classicism&lt;/a&gt;. Several critics have credited \"Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e\", as well as all his dramas, with providing some of the first truly believable portrayals in local literature. Vianu stressed that Classicist borrowings in Caragiale's writings were limited, indicating that Caragiale parted with the notion of \"generic types\" to look for the \"social\" ones. In parallel, literary critic &lt;a href=\"George%20C%C4%83linescu\"&gt;George C\u0103linescu&lt;/a&gt; argued that \"[t]he typological structure is present in Caragiale's work as a supporting structure, without being essential.\"\nIn Vianu's assessment, the universal human nature was important to Caragiale, but not made instantly obvious (as opposed to the immediate importance his characters were meant to have in the eyes of his public). Vianu illustrated this concept after investigating the manner in which Caragiale completed his \"O scrisoare pierdut\u0103\": the author was for long undecided about which character was to win the electoral battle on which the play centers, but opted for Agami\u0163\u0103 Dandanache, the senile &lt;a href=\"Radicalism%20%28historical%29\"&gt;radical&lt;/a&gt;, because his victory was to give the play more depth. Caragiale was thus quoted saying that Dandanache was \"more stupid\" than the clueless politician Tache Farfuridi, and \"more of a scoundrel\" than the unprincipled and cunning journalist Nae Ca\u0163avencu.\nIn Vianu's view, \"Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e\" was more vague in this respect, giving little insight into morals and states of mind, whereas the other, longer, novellas did depict feelings and occasionally provided additional details such as &lt;a href=\"physiology\"&gt;physiology&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cenesthesia\"&gt;cenesthesia&lt;/a&gt;. Also according to Vianu, Ion Luca Caragiale, unlike the Naturalists, was generally not interested in offering the reader access to his characters' &lt;a href=\"Psychology\"&gt;psychological&lt;/a&gt; background\u2014aside from his \"&lt;a href=\"N%C4%83pasta\"&gt;N\u0103pasta&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"P%C4%83cat\"&gt;P\u0103cat&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"O%20f%C4%83clie%20de%20Pa%C5%9Fte\"&gt;O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte&lt;/a&gt;\", he only adopted the psychological technique in satirical contexts, as a means to parody its use. A similar view was expressed by Vianu's predecessor, &lt;a href=\"Silvian%20Iosifescu\"&gt;Silvian Iosifescu&lt;/a&gt;, who also stressed that Caragiale always avoided applying the Naturalist technique to its fullest, while George C\u0103linescu himself believed that the characters' motivations in \"O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte\" are actually physiological and &lt;a href=\"Ethnology\"&gt;ethnological&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaiorescu was especially fond of the way in which Caragiale balanced his personal perspective and the generic traits he emphasized: speaking of Leiba Zibal, the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; character in \"O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte\" who defends himself out of fear, he drew a comparison with Shakespeare's &lt;a href=\"Shylock\"&gt;Shylock&lt;/a&gt;. He thus noted that, for all the differences in style between the two authors, both their characters stood for the Jewish people as a whole. This assessment was backed by Maiorescu's adversary, &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Dobrogeanu-Gherea\"&gt;Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&lt;/a&gt;. George C\u0103linescu also believed that, aside from his individual nature, Zibal provided readers with an accurate insight into Jewish reactions to systemic persecution and death threats. Such assessments were rejected by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Zarifopol\"&gt;Paul Zarifopol&lt;/a&gt;, who opposed generalizations and commented that the work only referred to \"[t]he ingenious cruelty of a man maddened by fear\".\nAllegories.\nOne of Caragiale's main and earliest types is that of the young man gripped by love, expressing himself through emphatic and Romantic clich\u00e9s\u2014its main representative is \"&lt;a href=\"O%20noapte%20furtunoas%C4%83\"&gt;O noapte furtunoas\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\"'s Ric\u0103 Venturiano. As Vianu commented, Caragiale exploited the theme to so much success that it took another generation for youthful love to be presented in a non-comedic context (with the common signature writings of &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Etefan%20Octavian%20Iosif\"&gt;\u015etefan Octavian Iosif&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20Anghel\"&gt;Dimitrie Anghel&lt;/a&gt;). At the other end are &lt;a href=\"Patriarchy\"&gt;patriarchal&lt;/a&gt; figures, heads of families who seem unable or unwilling to investigate their wives' &lt;a href=\"Adultery\"&gt;adulterous&lt;/a&gt; relations with younger men. This behavior is notably present in \"O noapte furtunoas\u0103\", where the aged Dumitrache fails to note even the most obvious signs that his wife Veta is in love with his good friend Chiriac. A more complex situation is present in \"O scrisoare pierdut\u0103\", where political boss Trahanache cannot tell that his wife Joi\u0163ica is having an affair with Tip\u0103tescu, and, when confronted with the evidence, is more interested in proving that she is not.\nWith Venturiano, Caragiale also introduces criticism of the liberal journalist and lawyers. A law school student, Venturiano contributes long and exaggerated articles to the republican press, which recall those authored by &lt;a href=\"C.%20A.%20Rosetti\"&gt;C. A. Rosetti&lt;/a&gt; and his collaborators. A more elaborate such character is Nae Ca\u0163avencu, who plays a major part in \"O scrisoare pierdut\u0103\", and who, using a \"Red\" discourse, attacks politicians on all sides with turbulent remarks and recourse to &lt;a href=\"blackmail\"&gt;blackmail&lt;/a&gt;. He profits from the more moderate attitudes of his adversaries to proclaim himself a &lt;a href=\"Progressivism\"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; politician, and he is successful in doing so\u2014Ca\u0163avencu rallies around him a group of teachers and other state employees. The only person who is able to stop his rise is Agami\u0163\u0103 Dandanache, an old &lt;a href=\"Wallachian%20Revolution%20of%201848\"&gt;1848 revolutionary&lt;/a&gt;. Danadanche, shown to have been sidelined from politics, makes a comeback at a time when the factions needs his inoffensive presence as a third-party, and, although senile, has a vast experience in blackmailing. &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Etefan%20Cazimir\"&gt;\u015etefan Cazimir&lt;/a&gt; linked Dandanache to a new &lt;a href=\"aristocracy\"&gt;aristocracy&lt;/a&gt;, created around the first generation of Romanian liberals, and likened him to a &lt;a href=\"Hidalgo%20%28Spanish%20nobility%29\"&gt;hidalgo&lt;/a&gt;. Tache Farfuridi, a competitor to both, has been described by Cazimir as a conformist self-seeker, in the manner of &lt;a href=\"M.%20and%20Mme.%20Joseph%20Prudhomme\"&gt;M. Joseph Prudhomme&lt;/a&gt;, a character made famous by &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Monnier\"&gt;Henri Monnier&lt;/a&gt;'s prose.\nWritten between the two other comedies, \"&lt;a href=\"Conu%20Leonida%20fa%C5%A3%C4%83%20cu%20reac%C5%A3iunea\"&gt;Conu Leonida fa\u0163\u0103 cu reac\u0163iunea&lt;/a&gt;\" depicts the long-term effects of republican discourse on its fascinated audience, through the sayings and actions of Leonida. The latter, whose source of income is a state &lt;a href=\"pension\"&gt;pension&lt;/a&gt;, notably supports the notion that the \"Red\" republic will provide each clerk with a salary, a pension, as well as a &lt;a href=\"debt%20moratorium\"&gt;debt moratorium&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"%C5%9Eerban%20Cioculescu\"&gt;\u015eerban Cioculescu&lt;/a&gt; noted that this request had already been voiced in real life, and issued as a political program by an obscure &lt;a href=\"Utopian%20socialism\"&gt;Utopian socialist&lt;/a&gt; named Pi\u0163urc\u0103. Eventually, Leonida is convinced that revolution cannot be on the rise, since the authorities have banned the firing of weapons within city limits. Similar fallacies are uttered by one of the secondary characters in \"&lt;a href=\"D-ale%20carnavalului\"&gt;D-ale carnavalului&lt;/a&gt;\", known to the other protagonists as \"Catindatul\", who has a vague familiarity with both &lt;a href=\"Subjective%20idealism\"&gt;subjective idealist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Materialism\"&gt;materialist&lt;/a&gt; tenets, the sources for his absurd theories about &lt;a href=\"suggestibility\"&gt;suggestibility&lt;/a&gt; and \"magnetism\"\u2014two processes in which he sees the universal source for all discomfort or disease. In parallel, Zarifopol argued, the writer had even allowed ironic reflections on the impact of various theories to seep into a more serious work, \"O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte\", where two students terrify the innkeeper Zibal by casually discussing &lt;a href=\"anthropological%20criminology\"&gt;anthropological criminology&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral other of Caragiale's characters have traditionally been considered &lt;a href=\"Allegory\"&gt;allegories&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"social%20class\"&gt;social class&lt;/a&gt;es and even regional identities. One of the most famous ones is &lt;a href=\"Mitic%C4%83\"&gt;Mitic\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, a recurring character who stands for ordinary &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;ers, &lt;a href=\"Wallachia\"&gt;Wallachia&lt;/a&gt;ns or &lt;a href=\"Muntenia\"&gt;Muntenia&lt;/a&gt;ns in general. A &lt;a href=\"Hypocrisy\"&gt;hypocritical&lt;/a&gt; and seemingly superficial man, Mitic\u0103 expresses himself through either platitudes or clich\u00e9s he believes are clever, and, illustrating a tendency Caragiale first recorded in his \"&lt;a href=\"Moftul%20Rom%C3%A2n\"&gt;Moftul Rom\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt;\", quickly dismisses all important things he is confronted with. Similarly, the teacher &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Chico%C5%9F%20Rostogan\"&gt;Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan&lt;/a&gt;, who is present or named in several sketches, stands for those &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;n expatriates in Romania whose sympathies went to the liberal current. His discourse, through which Caragiale sarcastically illustrates liberal tenets in respect to &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian education&lt;/a&gt;, is centered on a disregard for content and a rigor for memorizing irrelevant details. It has been proposed that Rostogan is at least partly based on Vasile Grigore Borgovan, a Transylvanian-born educator and resident of &lt;a href=\"Drobeta-Turnu%20Severin\"&gt;Turnu Severin&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Cet\u0103\u0163eanul turmentat\", an unnamed inebriated man who makes brief but relevant appearances in \"O scrisoare pierdut\u0103\", is thought to symbolize simple townsfolk, utterly confused by the political battle going on around them, and ignored by all the notabilities. Like his counterpart, the police agent Ghi\u0163\u0103 Pristanda, the inebriated elector has no relevant personal ambition, and stands for the so-called \"government dowry\"\u2014people afraid of losing their offices, and ready to back whoever is in power. According to C\u0103linescu, the inebriated citizen worships authority as a \"supreme god\", despite all its absurdities. He repeatedly claims to have served Trahanache during &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20John%20Cuza\"&gt;Alexander John Cuza&lt;/a&gt;'s ousting, but his supposed patron only acknowledges him once, when asking party members to \"escort this honorable person outside\".\nIn a number of his short stories and sketches, Caragiale makes use of another particularly \"Junimist\" theme, and investigates the glamorous but superficial impact of &lt;a href=\"modernization\"&gt;modernization&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"upper%20class\"&gt;high society&lt;/a&gt;. In one sketch, a couple of ladies dine in an opulent salon, while cursing their maid, gossiping, and showing interest in vulgar subjects. The characters in these writings tend to resemble each other, evidencing the generic traits of the well-to-do.\nOther traits and characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Anxiety\"&gt;Anxieties&lt;/a&gt; take the central stage in several of Caragiale's writings. From early on, Caragiale's minute analysis of mounting terror in \"O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte\" won the praise of &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Dobrogeanu-Gherea\"&gt;Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&lt;/a&gt;. In several of his sketches and stories, characters are driven to despair by their inability to cope with real or presumed changes in their environment. This is shown to have happened to characters such as Leiba Zibal, Stavrache\u2014the pub owner in \"&lt;a href=\"%C3%8En%20vreme%20de%20r%C4%83zboi\"&gt;\u00cen vreme de r\u0103zboi&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014, as well as Anghelache (the suicide victim in \"Inspec\u0163iune...\", part of \"&lt;a href=\"Momente%20%C5%9Fi%20schi%C5%A3e\"&gt;Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e&lt;/a&gt;\"). \u015eerban Cioculescu referred to the latter three as \"great &lt;a href=\"Neurosis\"&gt;neurotics&lt;/a&gt;\", while Iosifescu defined Zibal and Stavrache as \"&lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;demented&lt;/a&gt;\". Among the group of insane characters in Caragiale's work, C\u0103linescu counted those of sketches and stories like \"1 Aprilie\" (\"1st of April\"), where an &lt;a href=\"April%20Fools%27%20Day\"&gt;April Fool&lt;/a&gt; ends with a murder, and \"&lt;a href=\"Dou%C4%83%20loturi\"&gt;Dou\u0103 loturi&lt;/a&gt;\", where the clerk Lefter Popescu goes through the tribulations of having lost his winning ticket.\nAnxiety over imminent events grips the main characters in \"Conu Leonida fa\u0163\u0103 cu reac\u0163iunea\", and plays a part in female behavior as depicted in all his other comedies. A special kind of fear animates the main protagonists of \"D-ale carnavalului\", whose jealousy leads them to act irrationally. Thus, Iancu Pampon, an assistant-barber and former police officer, and his female counterpart, the republican suburbanite Mi\u0163a Baston, are determined to uncover their partners' amorous escapades, and their hectic inquiry combines real clues with figments of imagination, fits of passionate rage with moments of sad meditation, and violent threats with periods of resignation. Glimpses into this type of behavior have been noted in other plays by Caragiale: Cazimir placed emphasis on the fact that Farfuridi is shown to be extremely cautious towards all unplanned changes, and consumes much of his energy in preserving a largely pointless daily routine.\nMany of Caragiale's writings reproduce discussions between clerks on their time off, which usually take the shape of generic and awkward forays into culture or politics. Several of the characters in his sketches spuriously claim to be personal friends of major political figures of the day, or to have access to the back-rooms of politics and journalism. Although often alarmed by political or social developments, they tend to accommodate them quickly, and often encourage each other during very long stays at the &lt;a href=\"beer%20garden\"&gt;beer garden&lt;/a&gt;. Gravitating in this environment are the petty journalists, who boast access to unlikely &lt;a href=\"Scoop%20%28term%29\"&gt;scoops&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; having decided to invade Romania. In one instance, Caragiale invents Caracudi, a newspaperman who writes his &lt;a href=\"Sensationalism\"&gt;sensationalist&lt;/a&gt; articles while relaxing in the park.\nCaragiale's &lt;a href=\"persona\"&gt;persona&lt;/a&gt; is placed in numerous of his works. Aside from deduced self-portraits in \"&lt;a href=\"C%C4%83nu%C5%A3%C4%83%20om%20sucit\"&gt;C\u0103nu\u0163\u0103 om sucit&lt;/a&gt;\" and elsewhere, he created the famous background character Nenea Iancu (\"Uncle Iancu\"), building on his colloquial name and his status as a regular client of the beer gardens. He introduces several of his \"Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e\" characters as personal friends, and garnishes the stories with intimate details. Late in his life, he even confessed that the affair involving Venturiano, Dumitrache, and Dumitrache's wife Veta was partly based on an amorous misadventure he experienced as a young man.\nLiterary influences.\nAside from the many authors whose works he quoted, translated or &lt;a href=\"Parody\"&gt;parodied&lt;/a&gt;, Ion Luca Caragiale built on a vast literary legacy. According to literary historian &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Etefan%20Cazimir\"&gt;\u015etefan Cazimir&lt;/a&gt;: \"No writer ever had as large a number of precursors [as Caragiale], just as no other artistic synthesis was ever more organic and more spontaneous.\"\nA man of the theater first and foremost, Caragiale was well-acquainted with the work of his predecessors, from &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Romanticism\"&gt;Romantics&lt;/a&gt;, and heavily impressed by the French \"&lt;a href=\"com%C3%A9die%20en%20vaudeville\"&gt;com\u00e9die en vaudeville&lt;/a&gt;\". He applied the notion of &lt;a href=\"well-made%20play\"&gt;well-made play&lt;/a&gt;s, as theorized by &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20Scribe\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne Scribe&lt;/a&gt;, and was also influenced by the &lt;a href=\"dramaturgy\"&gt;dramaturgy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20Marin%20Labiche\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne Marin Labiche&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Victorien%20Sardou\"&gt;Victorien Sardou&lt;/a&gt;. Reportedly, Labiche was his favorite author.\nThe writer himself cited &lt;a href=\"Cilibi%20Moise\"&gt;Cilibi Moise&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Wallachian Jewish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"peddler\"&gt;peddler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aphorism\"&gt;aphorist&lt;/a&gt;, as an early influence, recalling how, as a child, he used to read his &lt;a href=\"one-liner%20joke\"&gt;one-liner joke&lt;/a&gt;s, and treasured them as exceptional samples of concise humor. He was similarly impressed by the works of Moise's contemporary, the prolific author &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Pann\"&gt;Anton Pann&lt;/a&gt;, whose accomplishments he praised during talks with his fellow \"&lt;a href=\"Convorbiri%20Critice\"&gt;Convorbiri Critice&lt;/a&gt;\" contributors, and whose work served as a source for at least one of his own stories. &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Filimon\"&gt;Nicolae Filimon&lt;/a&gt;, whom Caragiale praised on several occasions, was the author of short stories which several authors have identified as less accomplished versions of Ric\u0103 Venturiano. A similar connection has been traced between the various sketches authored by &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Heliade%20R%C4%83dulescu\"&gt;Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu&lt;/a&gt;, in which Transylvanian writers are the object of ridicule, and Caragiale's character &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Chico%C5%9F%20Rostogan\"&gt;Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan&lt;/a&gt;. Caragiale's late admiration for &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Petriceicu%20Hasdeu\"&gt;Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu&lt;/a&gt; was also linked to affinities in comedic styles, as was his companionship with &lt;a href=\"Iacob%20Negruzzi\"&gt;Iacob Negruzzi&lt;/a&gt; (himself the author of sarcastic pieces ridiculing the liberal politicians and lawyers).\nCaragiale is also believed to have used and developed several themes already present in &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian theater&lt;/a&gt;. One such precursor is the author of comedies &lt;a href=\"Teodor%20Myller\"&gt;Teodor Myller&lt;/a&gt;, especially through his play \"Fata lui Chir Troanc\u0103\" (\"Kir Troanc\u0103's Daughter\"). The writer was most likely very familiar with the comedies authored by his two uncles, &lt;a href=\"Costache%20Caragiale\"&gt;Costache&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iorgu%20Caragiale\"&gt;Iorgu&lt;/a&gt;, which have been shown to develop themes he later explored in depth. Among the minor 19th century dramatists whose comedic works were familiar to Caragiale, and in many ways similar to his, own was &lt;a href=\"Costache%20Halepliu\"&gt;Costache Halepliu&lt;/a&gt;. Another often-cited influence is his predecessor and adversary &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Alecsandri\"&gt;Vasile Alecsandri&lt;/a&gt;, whose \"&lt;a href=\"Coana%20Chiri%C5%A3a\"&gt;Coana Chiri\u0163a&lt;/a&gt;\" plays are an early critique of &lt;a href=\"Westernization\"&gt;Westernization&lt;/a&gt;. The two authors nonetheless differ in many ways, with Caragiale assuming a more complex role, and observing a more complex society.\nIon Luca Caragiale is known to have been amused by the &lt;a href=\"stock%20character\"&gt;stock character&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Macaire\"&gt;Robert Macaire&lt;/a&gt;, at a time when the latter had been turned into a comedic character by &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9rick%20Lema%C3%AEtre\"&gt;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Lema\u00eetre&lt;/a&gt;. While in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, he purchased the cartoons of French artists &lt;a href=\"Honor%C3%A9%20Daumier\"&gt;Honor\u00e9 Daumier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Gavarni\"&gt;Paul Gavarni&lt;/a&gt; (although it is not known if their separate portrayals of Macaire were familiar to him)\u2014among these drawings was one showing notabilities embracing one another while picking each other's pockets, which shows similarities with Caragiale's own take on society. According to Cazimir, it is possible that he knew Daumier's work from early on, as several other subjects caricatured by the French artist bear a remarkable resemblance to his texts.\nIon Luca Caragiale was also keenly aware and receptive of his contemporaries' works and of \"&lt;a href=\"fin%20de%20si%C3%A8cle\"&gt;fin de si\u00e8cle&lt;/a&gt;\" innovations. The literary creations of &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Zola\"&gt;\u00c9mile Zola&lt;/a&gt; were a noted source of inspiration, and the parallel led &lt;a href=\"George%20C%C4%83linescu\"&gt;George C\u0103linescu&lt;/a&gt; to propose him and &lt;a href=\"Barbu%20%C5%9Etef%C4%83nescu%20Delavrancea\"&gt;Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea&lt;/a&gt; as the main representatives of Zola's style in local literature. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Dobrogeanu-Gherea\"&gt;Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&lt;/a&gt; believed that both \"&lt;a href=\"N%C4%83pasta\"&gt;N\u0103pasta&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"O%20f%C4%83clie%20de%20Pa%C5%9Fte\"&gt;O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte&lt;/a&gt;\" showed the \"obvious enough influence\" of &lt;a href=\"Fyodor%20Dostoevsky\"&gt;Fyodor Dostoevsky&lt;/a&gt;. Late in his life, Caragiale discovered the literature of &lt;a href=\"Anatole%20France\"&gt;Anatole France&lt;/a&gt;\u2014according to &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Zarifopol\"&gt;Paul Zarifopol&lt;/a&gt;, France's &lt;a href=\"Humanism\"&gt;Humanist&lt;/a&gt; themes served as a model for some of Caragiale's &lt;a href=\"Fantasy%20literature\"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; writings.\nDiscussing the latter works, Vianu noted that they reminded one of &lt;a href=\"Shakespeare%27s%20late%20romances\"&gt;Shakespeare's late romances&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Eerban%20Cioculescu\"&gt;\u015eerban Cioculescu&lt;/a&gt; believed them to have been indirectly inspired by the works of &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Allan%20Poe\"&gt;Edgar Allan Poe&lt;/a&gt;. In his report for the Academy, &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20C.%20Oll%C4%83nescu-Ascanio\"&gt;Dimitrie C. Oll\u0103nescu-Ascanio&lt;/a&gt; also drew a parallel between Poe's works and \"&lt;a href=\"La%20hanul%20lui%20M%C3%A2njoal%C4%83\"&gt;La hanul lui M\u00e2njoal\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", but this hypothesis was rejected by Zarifopol. In addition, \"&lt;a href=\"Kir%20Ianulea\"&gt;Kir Ianulea&lt;/a&gt;\", partly using &lt;a href=\"Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli\"&gt;Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli&lt;/a&gt;'s novel as a source, was held as evidence of Caragiale's interest in &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20literature\"&gt;Renaissance literature&lt;/a&gt;.\nCultural legacy.\nThe writer's investigations into &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian culture&lt;/a&gt; also resulted in an accurate record of the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian language&lt;/a&gt; as it was spoken during his day, sampling &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20dialects\"&gt;dialects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jargon\"&gt;jargon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"slang\"&gt;slang&lt;/a&gt;, verbal &lt;a href=\"tic\"&gt;tic&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as illustrating the experiments undertaken by conflicting schools of &lt;a href=\"linguistics\"&gt;linguistics&lt;/a&gt; during the 19th and early 20th century, as well as the traces they left on the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20lexis\"&gt;Romanian lexis&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20Vianu\"&gt;Tudor Vianu&lt;/a&gt;'s opinion, this was partly owed to his keen musical ear.\nCaragiale was an enduring influence on both &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20humor\"&gt;Romanian humor&lt;/a&gt; and the views Romanians take of themselves. His comedies and various stories have produced a series of &lt;a href=\"catchphrase\"&gt;catchphrase&lt;/a&gt;s, many of which are still present in both cultural reference. Nevertheless, his uncomfortable criticism has occasionally seen him assigned a secondary place in the &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian curriculum&lt;/a&gt; and the academic discourse, a tendency notably endorsed by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Guard\"&gt;Iron Guard&lt;/a&gt; (Romania's main &lt;a href=\"Fascism\"&gt;fascist&lt;/a&gt; movement) and the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Romania\"&gt;Communist regime&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn parallel, Caragiale's techniques have influenced 20th century dramatists such as &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Sorbul\"&gt;Mihail Sorbul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Ion%20Popa\"&gt;Victor Ion Popa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Sebastian\"&gt;Mihail Sebastian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"George%20Mihail%20Zamfirescu\"&gt;George Mihail Zamfirescu&lt;/a&gt;, and various directors, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20I.%20Nottara\"&gt;Constantin I. Nottara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Gusti\"&gt;Paul Gusti&lt;/a&gt;. Several of his theatrical writings have been the subject of essays authored by director &lt;a href=\"Sic%C4%83%20Alexandrescu\"&gt;Sic\u0103 Alexandrescu&lt;/a&gt;, whose interpretation of the texts made use of the &lt;a href=\"Stanislavsky%20System\"&gt;Stanislavsky System&lt;/a&gt;. Caragiale's short stories and novellas have inspired authors such as &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20A.%20Bassarabescu\"&gt;Ioan A. Bassarabescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Br%C4%83escu\"&gt;Gheorghe Br\u0103escu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Alexandru%20Br%C4%83tescu-Voine%C5%9Fti\"&gt;Ioan Alexandru Br\u0103tescu-Voine\u015fti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dumitru%20D.%20P%C4%83tr%C4%83%C5%9Fcanu\"&gt;Dumitru D. P\u0103tr\u0103\u015fcanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"I.%20Peltz\"&gt;I. Peltz&lt;/a&gt;, and, in later decades, &lt;a href=\"Radu%20Cosa%C5%9Fu\"&gt;Radu Cosa\u015fu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20L%C4%83cust%C4%83\"&gt;Ioan L\u0103cust\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horia%20G%C3%A2rbea\"&gt;Horia G\u00e2rbea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dumitru%20Radu%20Popa\"&gt;Dumitru Radu Popa&lt;/a&gt;. According to various authors, Caragiale was also a predecessor of &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20the%20Absurd\"&gt;Absurdism&lt;/a&gt;, and he is known to have been cited as an influence by the Absurdist dramatist &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20Ionesco\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco&lt;/a&gt;. Outside Romania, the impact of Ion Luca Caragiale's literature was much reduced\u2014the 1996 \"Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre\" attributed this to the technical problems posed by translations, as well as to the tendency of staging his works as &lt;a href=\"period%20piece\"&gt;period piece&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSeveral authors have left memoirs of Ion Luca Caragiale. They include &lt;a href=\"Octavian%20Goga\"&gt;Octavian Goga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Slavici\"&gt;Ioan Slavici&lt;/a&gt;, I. Suchianu, &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Caragiale\"&gt;Luca Caragiale&lt;/a&gt;, Ecaterina Logadi-Caragiale, and &lt;a href=\"Cincinat%20Pavelescu\"&gt;Cincinat Pavelescu&lt;/a&gt;. Among his later biographers was &lt;a href=\"Octav%20Minar\"&gt;Octav Minar&lt;/a&gt;, who stood accused of having forged certain details for commercial gain. Direct or covert depictions of Caragiale are also present in several fiction works, starting with a &lt;a href=\"revue\"&gt;revue&lt;/a&gt; first shown during his lifetime, and including novels by Goga, Slavici, &lt;a href=\"N.%20Petra%C5%9Fcu\"&gt;N. Petra\u015fcu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emanoil%20Bucu%C5%A3a\"&gt;Emanoil Bucu\u0163a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eugen%20Lovinescu\"&gt;Eugen Lovinescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Stere\"&gt;Constantin Stere&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a play by &lt;a href=\"Camil%20Petrescu\"&gt;Camil Petrescu&lt;/a&gt;. In 1939, &lt;a href=\"B.%20Jordan\"&gt;B. Jordan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20Predescu\"&gt;Lucian Predescu&lt;/a&gt;, published a common signature novel on the writer, which was criticized for its style, tone, and inaccuracies. The short story writer Br\u0103tescu-Voine\u015fti proposed that Ion Luca Caragiale's love affair with &lt;a href=\"Veronica%20Micle\"&gt;Veronica Micle&lt;/a&gt; and Eminescu's anger provide the key to Eminescu's poem \"&lt;a href=\"Luceaf%C4%83rul%20%28poem%29\"&gt;Luceaf\u0103rul&lt;/a&gt;\", but his theory remains controversial. Caragiale is also probably present in his son &lt;a href=\"Mateiu%20Caragiale\"&gt;Mateiu&lt;/a&gt;'s work \"&lt;a href=\"Craii%20de%20Curtea-Veche\"&gt;Craii de Curtea-Veche&lt;/a&gt;\", where his lifestyle and contribution to literature appear to be the subjects of derision.\nThe writer was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Academy\"&gt;Romanian Academy&lt;/a&gt; posthumously, in 1948, upon the proposal of novelist &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Sadoveanu\"&gt;Mihail Sadoveanu&lt;/a&gt;. 2002, the 150th anniversary of Ion Luca Caragiale's birth, was celebrated in Romania as the \"Anul Caragiale\" (the \"Caragiale Year\"). Annual theater festivals in his honor are held in Bucharest and the &lt;a href=\"Moldova\"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt;n capital of &lt;a href=\"Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u\"&gt;Chi\u015fin\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;. Caragiale's work has been the subject of many productions in &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian cinema&lt;/a&gt; and television\u2014films based on his writings include the 1958 \"&lt;a href=\"Dou%C4%83%20lozuri\"&gt;Dou\u0103 lozuri&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20Pintilie\"&gt;Lucian Pintilie&lt;/a&gt;'s 1981 \"&lt;a href=\"De%20ce%20trag%20clopotele%2C%20Mitic%C4%83%3F\"&gt;De ce trag clopotele, Mitic\u0103?&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1982, a &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West German&lt;/a&gt; film, directed by &lt;a href=\"Radu%20Garbea\"&gt;Radu Garbea&lt;/a&gt; and based on \"&lt;a href=\"O%20f%C4%83clie%20de%20Pa%C5%9Fte\"&gt;O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte&lt;/a&gt;\", was released as \"&lt;a href=\"F%C3%BCrchte%20dich%20nicht%2C%20Jakob%21\"&gt;F\u00fcrchte dich nicht, Jakob!&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Theatre%20Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest National Theater&lt;/a&gt; is currently known in full as \"\"Ion Luca Caragiale\" National Theater\". Several educational institutions were named in his, including the &lt;a href=\"Academia%20de%20Art%C4%83%20Teatral%C4%83%20%C5%9Fi%20Cinematografic%C4%83%20Caragiale%20din%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Theater and Film Academy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Luca%20Caragiale%20National%20College%20%28Bucharest%29\"&gt;Ion Luca Caragiale National College&lt;/a&gt; in Bucharest, the national college in Ploie\u015fti, and a high school in &lt;a href=\"Moreni\"&gt;Moreni&lt;/a&gt;. Among the statues raised in his honor are &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Baraschi\"&gt;Constantin Baraschi&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Ion%20Luca%20Caragiale%20%28Bucharest%29\"&gt;Bucharest monument&lt;/a&gt;, and busts in the capital's &lt;a href=\"Ci%C5%9Fmigiu%20Gardens\"&gt;Ci\u015fmigiu Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and in Ploie\u015fti. He was the subject of portraits and caricatures by various artists, and, in 2007, upon the completion of a five-year project involving cartoonists inside and outside Romania, he was designated \"the most portrayed writer\" by the &lt;a href=\"Guinness%20World%20Records\"&gt;Guinness Book of Records&lt;/a&gt; (with over 1,500 individual drawings in a single exhibit).\nIn 1962, a house in &lt;a href=\"Ploie%C5%9Fti\"&gt;Ploie\u015fti&lt;/a&gt; has been turned into a museum honoring Caragiale (the \"&lt;a href=\"Dobrescu%20House%2C%20Ploie%C5%9Fti\"&gt;Dobrescu House&lt;/a&gt;\"). His native home in &lt;a href=\"I.%20L.%20Caragiale%2C%20D%C3%A2mbovi%C5%A3a\"&gt;Haimanale&lt;/a&gt; was opened for the public in 1979. Memorial plaques have also been set up in &lt;a href=\"Buz%C4%83u\"&gt;Buz\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=\"Sch%C3%B6neberg\"&gt;Sch\u00f6neberg&lt;/a&gt;'s Hohenzollerndamm. His name was given to streets, avenues, parks or quarters in many Romanian cities\u2014such landmarks include the Bucharest street he lived on around 1900, a street in Ploie\u015fti, a quarter in &lt;a href=\"Bra%C5%9Fov\"&gt;Bra\u015fov&lt;/a&gt;, and a park in &lt;a href=\"Cluj-Napoca\"&gt;Cluj-Napoca&lt;/a&gt;. A street in Chi\u015fin\u0103u also bears the name Caragiale."
