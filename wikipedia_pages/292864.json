    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, G2 is the name of three simple &lt;a href=\"Lie%20group\"&gt;Lie group&lt;/a&gt;s (a complex form, a compact real form and a split real form), their &lt;a href=\"Lie%20algebra\"&gt;Lie algebra&lt;/a&gt;s formula_1 as well as some &lt;a href=\"algebraic%20group\"&gt;algebraic group&lt;/a&gt;s. They are the smallest of the five exceptional &lt;a href=\"simple%20Lie%20group\"&gt;simple Lie group&lt;/a&gt;s. G2 has rank 2 and dimension 14. It has two &lt;a href=\"fundamental%20representation\"&gt;fundamental representation&lt;/a&gt;s, with dimension 7 and 14.\nThe compact form of G2 can be described as the &lt;a href=\"automorphism%20group\"&gt;automorphism group&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Octonion\"&gt;octonion algebra&lt;/a&gt; or, equivalently, as the subgroup of SO(7) that preserves any chosen particular vector in its 8-dimensional &lt;a href=\"Real%20representation\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spinor\"&gt;spinor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Group%20representation\"&gt;representation&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"spin%20representation\"&gt;spin representation&lt;/a&gt;).\nHistory.\nThe Lie algebra formula_2, being the smallest exceptional simple Lie algebra, was the first of these to be discovered in the attempt to classify simple Lie algebras. On May 23, 1887, &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Killing\"&gt;Wilhelm Killing&lt;/a&gt; wrote a letter to &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Engel%20%28mathematician%29\"&gt;Friedrich Engel&lt;/a&gt; saying that he had found a 14-dimensional simple Lie algebra, which we now call formula_2.\nIn 1893, &lt;a href=\"%C3%89lie%20Cartan\"&gt;\u00c9lie Cartan&lt;/a&gt; published a note describing an open set in formula_4 equipped with a 2-dimensional &lt;a href=\"distribution%20%28differential%20geometry%29\"&gt;distribution&lt;/a&gt;\u2014that is, a smoothly varying field of 2-dimensional subspaces of the tangent space\u2014for which the Lie algebra formula_2 appears as the infinitesimal symmetries. In the same year, in the same journal, Engel noticed the same thing. Later it was discovered that the 2-dimensional distribution is closely related to a ball rolling on another ball. The space of configurations of the rolling ball is 5-dimensional, with a 2-dimensional distribution that describes motions of the ball where it rolls without slipping or twisting.\nIn 1900, Engel discovered that a generic antisymmetric trilinear form (or 3-form) on a 7-dimensional complex vector space is preserved by a group isomorphic to the complex form of G2.\nIn 1908 Cartan mentioned that the automorphism group of the octonions is a 14-dimensional simple Lie group. In 1914 he stated that this is the compact real form of G2.\nIn older books and papers, G2 is sometimes denoted by E2.\nReal forms.\nThere are 3 simple real Lie algebras associated with this root system:\nAlgebra.\nDynkin diagram and Cartan matrix.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dynkin%20diagram\"&gt;Dynkin diagram&lt;/a&gt; for \"G\"2 is given by .\nIts &lt;a href=\"Cartan%20matrix\"&gt;Cartan matrix&lt;/a&gt; is:\nRoots of G2.\nAlthough they &lt;a href=\"Linear%20span\"&gt;span&lt;/a&gt; a 2-dimensional space, as drawn, it is much more symmetric to consider them as &lt;a href=\"Vector%20space\"&gt;vectors&lt;/a&gt; in a 2-dimensional subspace of a three-dimensional space.\nOne set of simple roots, for is:\nWeyl/Coxeter group.\nIts &lt;a href=\"Weyl%20group\"&gt;Weyl&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Coxeter%20group\"&gt;Coxeter&lt;/a&gt; group formula_7 is the &lt;a href=\"dihedral%20group\"&gt;dihedral group&lt;/a&gt; formula_8 of &lt;a href=\"Coxeter%20group%23Properties\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; 12. It has minimal faithful degree formula_9.\nSpecial holonomy.\nG2 is one of the possible special groups that can appear as the &lt;a href=\"holonomy\"&gt;holonomy&lt;/a&gt; group of a &lt;a href=\"Riemannian%20metric\"&gt;Riemannian metric&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"manifold\"&gt;manifold&lt;/a&gt;s of G2 holonomy are also called &lt;a href=\"G2%20manifold\"&gt;G2-manifolds&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolynomial invariant.\nG2 is the automorphism group of the following two polynomials in 7 non-commutative variables.\nwhich comes from the octonion algebra. The variables must be non-commutative otherwise the second polynomial would be identically zero.\nGenerators.\nAdding a representation of the 14 generators with coefficients \"A\",\u00a0...,\u00a0\"N\" gives the matrix:\nIt is exactly the Lie algebra of the group\nRepresentations.\nThe characters of finite-dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the &lt;a href=\"Weyl%20character%20formula\"&gt;Weyl character formula&lt;/a&gt;. The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are :\nThe 14-dimensional representation is the &lt;a href=\"Adjoint%20representation%20of%20a%20Lie%20algebra\"&gt;adjoint representation&lt;/a&gt;, and the 7-dimensional one is action of G2 on the imaginary octonions.\nThere are two non-isomorphic irreducible representations of dimensions 77, 2079, 4928, 30107, etc. The &lt;a href=\"fundamental%20representation\"&gt;fundamental representation&lt;/a&gt;s are those with dimensions 14 and 7 (corresponding to the two nodes in the &lt;a href=\"%23Dynkin%20diagram\"&gt;Dynkin diagram&lt;/a&gt; in the order such that the triple arrow points from the first to the second).\n described the (infinite-dimensional) unitary irreducible representations of the split real form of G2.\nFinite groups.\nThe group G2(\"q\") is the points of the algebraic group G2 over the &lt;a href=\"finite%20field\"&gt;finite field&lt;/a&gt; F\"q\". These finite groups were first introduced by &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Eugene%20Dickson\"&gt;Leonard Eugene Dickson&lt;/a&gt; in for odd \"q\" and for even \"q\". The order of G2(\"q\") is . When , the group is &lt;a href=\"simple%20group\"&gt;simple&lt;/a&gt;, and when , it has a simple subgroup of &lt;a href=\"Index%20of%20a%20subgroup\"&gt;index&lt;/a&gt; 2 isomorphic to 2\"A\"2(32), and is the automorphism group of a maximal order of the octonions. The Janko group &lt;a href=\"Janko%20group%20J1\"&gt;J1&lt;/a&gt; was first constructed as a subgroup of G2(11). introduced twisted &lt;a href=\"Ree%20group\"&gt;Ree group&lt;/a&gt;s 2G2(\"q\") of order for , an odd power of 3."
