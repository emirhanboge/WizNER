    "text": "Johann Dietrich von H\u00fclsen (1 June 1693\u201329 May 1767) was a &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20general\"&gt;lieutenant general&lt;/a&gt; of the infantry. After a lifelong officer's career in various infantry regiments, he acquired the special respect of Frederick II in the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Seven Years' War&lt;/a&gt; as general, and was honored by him with the appointment as governor of Berlin. During the war, he became a &lt;a href=\"canon%20%28priest%29\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Minden\"&gt;Minden&lt;/a&gt; and was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Eagle%20Order\"&gt;Black Eagle Order&lt;/a&gt; and the Order &lt;a href=\"Pour%20le%20M%C3%A9rite\"&gt;Pour le M\u00e9rite&lt;/a&gt;. His name appears on the top tier of the &lt;a href=\"Equestrian%20statue%20of%20Frederick%20the%20Great\"&gt;Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamily.\nH\u00fclsen was a son of Johann Friedrich von H\u00fclsen and Rosine Baroness von K\u00f6nigsegg and grew up in the rural surroundings of &lt;a href=\"Rastenburg\"&gt;Rastenburg&lt;/a&gt;. He was born on 1 June 1693 in &lt;a href=\"Babieniec\"&gt;Babaziens&lt;/a&gt;. In Fall 1739, he married the twice-widowed Sophie Elisabeth von Kunheim. Their marriage was childless.\nMilitary career.\nH\u00fclsen's military career modeled that of other &lt;a href=\"Junker%20%28Prussia%29\"&gt;Junker&lt;/a&gt; sons. Many of the Junkers owned immense &lt;a href=\"Estate%20%28land%29\"&gt;estates&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the north-eastern half of Germany (i.e., the Prussian provinces of &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Brandenburg\"&gt;Brandenburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Pomerania%20%281815%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;Pomerania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silesia%20Province\"&gt;Silesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Prussia\"&gt;West Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20East%20Prussia\"&gt;East Prussia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Posen\"&gt;Posen&lt;/a&gt;). Their younger sons followed careers as soldiers (\"Fahnenjunker\"); consequently, the Junkers controlled the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20Army\"&gt;Prussian Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the age of seventeen, H\u00fclsen entered the Prussian Infantry Regiment No. 2 under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20General\"&gt;Lieutenant General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Magnus%20von%20Doenhoff\"&gt;Otto Magnus von Doenhoff&lt;/a&gt;, became a \"&lt;a href=\"Fahnrich\"&gt;Fahnrich&lt;/a&gt;\" (cadet) on 8 June 1715, and took part in the Pomerania campaign of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Northern%20War\"&gt;Great Northern War&lt;/a&gt; in the same year. In 1721, the regiment was stationed between &lt;a href=\"Insterburg\"&gt;Insterburg&lt;/a&gt; and Rastenburg. H\u00fclsen was promoted to &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; on 1 August 1722, and on 13 July 1728, to &lt;a href=\"first%20lieutenant\"&gt;first lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;. His length of time as a lieutenant, 15 years, were a consequence of his lack of education and polish. Throughout his career, his manners remained rough and his profanity was legendary.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Polish%20Succession\"&gt;War of the Polish Succession&lt;/a&gt;, his regiment, now under the command of &lt;a href=\"Field%20Marshall\"&gt;Field Marshall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Erhard%20Ernst%20von%20R%C3%B6der\"&gt;Erhard Ernst von R\u00f6der&lt;/a&gt;, moved to &lt;a href=\"Magdeburg\"&gt;Magdeburg&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently to &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg\"&gt;Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy\"&gt;Prince Eugene of Savoy&lt;/a&gt;. After the winter camp in the &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCnsterland\"&gt;M\u00fcnsterland&lt;/a&gt;, the campaign was carried out without success in 1735, and finally the regiment retreated. In &lt;a href=\"Halberstadt\"&gt;Halberstadt&lt;/a&gt;, H\u00fclsen was promoted to the staff captain on the occasion of a troop-show before &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20William%20I%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Frederick William I&lt;/a&gt;; in April 1738, back in &lt;a href=\"East%20Prussia\"&gt;East Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"captain\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, and received his own company.\nWars with Austria.\nIn July 1740, H\u00fclsen was placed as a &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; in the newly-formed 36th Infantry Regiment under &lt;a href=\"Major%20General\"&gt;Major General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Bogislav%20von%20M%C3%BCnchow\"&gt;Gustav Bogislaus von M\u00fcnchow&lt;/a&gt;, where he remained for sixteen years. In March 1741, the regiment was deployed in &lt;a href=\"Silesia\"&gt;Silesia&lt;/a&gt;, later under &lt;a href=\"Generalfeldmarschall\"&gt;Reichsgeneralfeldmarschall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20I%20of%20Anhalt-Dessau\"&gt;Leopold I of Anhalt-Dessau&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Cosel\"&gt;siege of Cosel&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, it was stationed in &lt;a href=\"Brandenburg\"&gt;Brandenburg&lt;/a&gt;, where H\u00fclsen was promoted to &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20colonel\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt; on 11 July 1743. In the course of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Silesian%20War\"&gt;Second Silesian War&lt;/a&gt;, the regiment took part in numerous battles and captured the occupied Cosel on 5 September 1745; subsequently H\u00fclsen was promoted to &lt;a href=\"colonel\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt; on 9 November.\nIn the following peace years, H\u00fclsen emerged above all as a good instructor. On 8 September 1754, now as &lt;a href=\"major%20general\"&gt;major general&lt;/a&gt;, he was awarded the order &lt;a href=\"Pour%20le%20M%C3%A9rite\"&gt;Pour le M\u00e9rite&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of his predecessor, Lieutenant General &lt;a href=\"Asmus%20Ehrenreich%20von%20Bredow\"&gt;Asmus Ehrenreich von Bredow&lt;/a&gt;, he was appointed &lt;a href=\"Proprietary%20colonel\"&gt;Proprietary colonel&lt;/a&gt; of the 21st Infantry Regiment on 25 February 1756, which was stationed in Halberstadt and &lt;a href=\"Quedlinburg\"&gt;Quedlinburg&lt;/a&gt;. He also received an annual pension of 500 &lt;a href=\"thalers\"&gt;thalers&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeven Years' War.\nAs an army commander, during the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Seven Years' War&lt;/a&gt;, he emerged as one of Frederick's most capable generals. In the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Lobositz\"&gt;Battle of Lobositz&lt;/a&gt;, his regiment suffered heavy losses, but Frederick II praised H\u00fclsen for his bravery: indeed, at least one &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Showalter\"&gt;historian&lt;/a&gt; attributed H\u00fclsen's success at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kolin\"&gt;Kolin&lt;/a&gt; to his hard-headed fighting. H\u00fclsen, \"not much troubled with either imagination or intelligence, was as brave a battle captain as his [Frederick's] army possessed.\" H\u00fclsen commanded the leading element of Frederick's task force, while his named regiment was fighting under Lieutenant General &lt;a href=\"Joachim%20Christian%20von%20Tresckow\"&gt;Joachim Christian von Tresckow&lt;/a&gt;. His mission at Kolin was to march along a high road paralleling the Austrian front; after he reached the village of &lt;a href=\"K%C5%99e%C4%8Dho%C5%99\"&gt;K\u0159e\u010dho\u0159&lt;/a&gt;, he was to shift right, clear the heights behind the village and take position facing west, against what Frederick presumed would be the exposed Austrian flank. The complexity of the battle orders, and the conditions of terrain made the execution of Frederick's wishes difficult; H\u00fclsen's troops did not actually advance until mid-afternoon. With these troops, and further support, he managed to take a decisive step in the late afternoon and defend the line until the night. In his writings on the history of the war, Frederick II expressly praised H\u00fclsen's zeal in this battle: certainly, H\u00fclsen's deliberate advance in the afternoon and his stubborn defense of his position into the late afternoon made it possible for him to cover the Prussian retreat; this, as much as Frederick's paucity of generals, warranted H\u00fclsen's promotion to lieutenant general on 6 March 1758.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kay\"&gt;Battle of Kay&lt;/a&gt;, H\u00fclsen suffered bloody losses and he himself was later wounded in the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kunersdorf\"&gt;Battle of Kunersdorf&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Maxen\"&gt;Battle of Maxen&lt;/a&gt;, he did not arrive in time to support &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20August%20von%20Finck\"&gt;Friedrich August von Finck&lt;/a&gt;. On 20 August 1760, he was able to defend himself against a hostile uprising with 12,000 men in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Strehla\"&gt;Battle of Strehla&lt;/a&gt;, whereupon the King gave him 1500 thalers, and wrote: \"I congratulate you [...] [Please extend to ] Officers of your subordinate Corps [...] My most gracious Compliments.\"\nWhen, in the same year, Austrians and Russians attempted to take Berlin, H\u00fclsen moved to &lt;a href=\"Beelitz\"&gt;Beelitz&lt;/a&gt; and at the Halleschen Gate, H\u00fclsen was able to defend the city against the cavalry of the Russian general &lt;a href=\"Gottlob%20Heinrich%20von%20Tottleben\"&gt;Gottlob Heinrich von Tottleben&lt;/a&gt;; this defense ultimately prevented the Russian occupation of Berlin. Soon afterwards he returned to Saxony, where H\u00fclsen commanded large parts of the infantry on 3 November 1760 in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Torgau\"&gt;Battle of Torgau&lt;/a&gt;. His command of the second column at Torgau was due, to some extent, on the army's increasing dearth of senior officers more than to his own gifts, but he was the perfect commander for what ensued. After three unsuccessful and costly attacks, H\u00fclsen gathered the survivors for one more attempt. His own horses had all been killed and a foot wound precluded his walking, so he mounted a cannon and commanded the men to pull him up the hill. The drummers beat the charge, and the Prussians followed H\u00fclsen up the slope. Simultaneously, but without coordination, hussars commanded by &lt;a href=\"General%20of%20Cavalry\"&gt;General of Cavalry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Joachim%20von%20Zieten\"&gt;Hans Joachim von Zieten&lt;/a&gt; mounted a parallel attack in the next sector. The attack was successful and secured the Prussian victory.\nIn the following year, under &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281747%E2%80%931767%29\"&gt;Prince Henry of Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, H\u00fclsen was entrusted with the defense of occupied Saxony, and was appointed commander-in-chief on 21 April, when the prince was removed to Silesia. At this point, the memory of the old general evidently diminished, for the king gave him a major general to assist his command. On 29 October 1762 at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Freiberg\"&gt;Battle of Freiberg&lt;/a&gt;, the last great battle of the Seven Years' War, he could not participate as planned, since his replacement had not yet arrived, but he advanced to &lt;a href=\"Pretzschendorf\"&gt;Pretzschendorf&lt;/a&gt; after the battle.\nPost-war assignments and death.\nAfter the war, H\u00fclsen was honored by Frederick II with the post of governor of Berlin on 23 August 1763, and in 1766 was charged with a court investigation against the financial councilor &lt;a href=\"Erhard%20Ursinus\"&gt;Erhard Ursinus&lt;/a&gt;. In October, he fell ill and died on 29 May 1767 in Berlin. He was buried in the garrison church on 1 June.\nIn 1851, H\u00fclsen was included on the &lt;a href=\"Equestrian%20statue%20of%20Frederick%20the%20Great\"&gt;Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great&lt;/a&gt; as one of Frederick's principal generals."
