The park forms part of the &lt;a href=\"Ulladulla%20to%20Merimbula%20Important%20Bird%20Area\"&gt;Ulladulla to Merimbula Important Bird Area&lt;/a&gt; because of its importance for &lt;a href=\"swift%20parrot\"&gt;swift parrot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIts name derives from Yuin elder &lt;a href=\"Biamanga%20%28person%29\"&gt;Biamanga&lt;/a&gt;, aka \"King Jack Mumbulla\", after whom Mumbulla Mountain was also named. It is an important &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australian\"&gt;Aboriginal&lt;/a&gt; site for the &lt;a href=\"Yuin%20people\"&gt;Yuin people&lt;/a&gt; and a prominent landmark that can be seen from across the &lt;a href=\"Bega%20Valley\"&gt;Bega Valley&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Biamanga. Proclaimed in 1994 and extended in 1997, the park covers . It is seen by the &lt;a href=\"traditional%20owners\"&gt;traditional owners&lt;/a&gt; as \"part of a single cultural landscape\" with the &lt;a href=\"Gulaga%20National%20Park\"&gt;Gulaga National Park&lt;/a&gt;, and also has cultural links to &lt;a href=\"Merriman%20Island\"&gt;Umbarra&lt;/a&gt; (Merriman Island), &lt;a href=\"Barunguba\"&gt;Barunguba&lt;/a&gt; (Montague Island), and &lt;a href=\"Dithol\"&gt;Dithol&lt;/a&gt; (Pigeon House Mountain).\nIn November 2021 Mumballa Mountain was ascribed the &lt;a href=\"dual%20name\"&gt;dual name&lt;/a&gt; of Biamanga.\nGeology.\nThe mountain is the remnants an ancient &lt;a href=\"shield%20volcano\"&gt;shield volcano&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt; rock formations and &lt;a href=\"boulder\"&gt;boulder&lt;/a&gt;s are visible along the course of Mumbulla Creek.\nHistory.\nThe park lies in the lands of one of the &lt;a href=\"Yuin\"&gt;Yuin&lt;/a&gt; peoples, who have inhabited the area for thousands of years.\n20th century.\nExtensive &lt;a href=\"logging\"&gt;logging&lt;/a&gt; was taking place in the area up until the 1970s, and in 1967 some of the rock was blasted with dynamite in the interests of improving television reception, and a television transmitter tower for &lt;a href=\"WIN-4\"&gt;WIN-4&lt;/a&gt; was built on the mountain. After concerns had been raised by local people, the NSW Government set up an advisory committee in 1977 to investigate the &lt;a href=\"woodchipping\"&gt;woodchipping&lt;/a&gt; industry and in the same year 1977 &lt;a href=\"Guboo%20Ted%20Thomas\"&gt;Guboo Ted Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, a Yuin &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20elder\"&gt;elder&lt;/a&gt;, led a protest against the destruction of the forest on Mumbulla Mountain. On 15 July 1980, the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Government\"&gt;New South Wales Government&lt;/a&gt; declared an area of around an \"&lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20place\"&gt;Aboriginal place&lt;/a&gt;\" and a \"Protected Archaeological Area\" under the \"&lt;a href=\"National%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20Act%201974\"&gt;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974&lt;/a&gt;\" (NSW).\nThe park was proclaimed in 1994 and extended in 1997.\n21st century.\nFurther protests against logging activities took place in 2010.\nOn 30 November 2021 Mumballa Mountain was ascribed the &lt;a href=\"dual%20name\"&gt;dual name&lt;/a&gt; of Biamanga.\nDescription.\nThe park covers . It is seen by the &lt;a href=\"traditional%20owners\"&gt;traditional owners&lt;/a&gt; as \"part of a single cultural landscape\" with the Gulaga National Park.\nFlora and fauna.\nThere are &lt;a href=\"monkey%20gum\"&gt;monkey gum&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ribbon%20gum\"&gt;ribbon gum&lt;/a&gt; along the creeks, and the park is home to &lt;a href=\"chef%27s%20cap%20correa\"&gt;chef's cap correa&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"endangered%20species\"&gt;endangered species&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe park forms part of the &lt;a href=\"Ulladulla%20to%20Merimbula%20Important%20Bird%20Area\"&gt;Ulladulla to Merimbula Important Bird Area&lt;/a&gt;, identified as such by &lt;a href=\"BirdLife%20International\"&gt;BirdLife International&lt;/a&gt; because of its importance for &lt;a href=\"swift%20parrot\"&gt;swift parrot&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Azure%20kingfisher\"&gt;Azure kingfisher&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"superb%20fairywren\"&gt;superb fairywren&lt;/a&gt;s abound in the park.\nManagement.\nBiamanga has been jointly managed by the traditional owners and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20Service%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29\"&gt;National Parks and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt; NSW since 2006. The traditional custodians are represented by two &lt;a href=\"Local%20Aboriginal%20Land%20Council\"&gt;Local Aboriginal Land Council&lt;/a&gt;s, the Merrimans and Bega LALCs, which own the title to the land and lease it back to the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Government\"&gt;New South Wales Government&lt;/a&gt; for use as a &lt;a href=\"national%20park\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt;.\nAboriginal significance and sites.\nThe mountain and surrounds have important cultural links to &lt;a href=\"Merriman%20Island\"&gt;Umbarra&lt;/a&gt; (Merriman Island), &lt;a href=\"Barunguba\"&gt;Barunguba&lt;/a&gt; (Montague Island), and &lt;a href=\"Dithol\"&gt;Dithol&lt;/a&gt; (Pigeon House Mountain). The mountain is of particular significance to the people of &lt;a href=\"Wallaga%20Lake\"&gt;Wallaga Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe park contains important Aboriginal sites, in particular Biamanga, also known as Mumbulla Mountain, which is part a large &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20ceremony\"&gt;ceremonial&lt;/a&gt; and cultural track on the &lt;a href=\"South%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29\"&gt;South Coast of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; that includes other &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20sacred%20site\"&gt;Aboriginal sacred site&lt;/a&gt;s of particular importance to the &lt;a href=\"Yuin\"&gt;Yuin&lt;/a&gt; peoples. The mountain was named after Yuin leader &lt;a href=\"King%20Jack%20Mumbulla\"&gt;King Jack Mumbulla&lt;/a&gt;, aka Jack Mumbler, whose \"tribal\" name was Biamanga. King Jack would spend time communing with the ancestor spirits on the highest peak of the mountain and send &lt;a href=\"smoke%20signal\"&gt;smoke signal&lt;/a&gt;s for his people to see. &lt;a href=\"Initiation%20ceremonies\"&gt;Initiation ceremonies&lt;/a&gt; were held by Yuin people at various spots on the mountain, with the last recorded one held there in 1918. It has been described as a \"men's law mountain\".\nIndependent evidence of the sacredness of the site was provided in 1964 by linguist &lt;a href=\"Luise%20Hercus\"&gt;Luise Hercus&lt;/a&gt; and by musician and linguist &lt;a href=\"Janet%20Mathews\"&gt;Janet Mathews&lt;/a&gt;, but only made publicly available in the late 1970s; as well as by notes made much earlier by &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20William%20Howitt\"&gt;Alfred William Howitt&lt;/a&gt;, an ethnologist who attended a Yuin initiation ceremony in 1883.\nThe Biamanga protest site is of additional significance both to Yuin and to all other &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;Indigenous Australians&lt;/a&gt;, \"as a representation of embodying the &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20land%20rights%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Australian Aboriginal campaign for land rights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20self-determination\"&gt;Aboriginal self-determination&lt;/a&gt;."
