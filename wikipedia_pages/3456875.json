    "text": "Virupaksha Raya II (1445\u20131485 CE) was a &lt;a href=\"king\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vijayanagara%20Empire\"&gt;Vijayanagara Empire&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sangama%20Dynasty\"&gt;Sangama Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1465, Virupaksha Raya II succeeded his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Mallikarjuna%20Raya\"&gt;Mallikarjuna Raya&lt;/a&gt;, a corrupt and weak ruler who continually lost against the empire's enemies. Even so, Virupaksha Raya II was no more of a better ruler than his predecessor. Throughout his reign, Virupaksha was faced with rebellious nobles and officers as well as multiple enemies who began to invade the weakened kingdom. It was during this time that Virupaksha Raya II lost the &lt;a href=\"Konkan\"&gt;Konkan&lt;/a&gt; coast (including &lt;a href=\"Goa\"&gt;Goa&lt;/a&gt;, Chaul, and Dabul) by 1470 to Prime Minister Mahamud Gawan from the Bahamani kingdom, who was sent to conquer the area by the Sultan Muhammad Shah III. The &lt;a href=\"Bahmani%20Sultan\"&gt;Bahmani Sultan&lt;/a&gt; would also invade &lt;a href=\"Doab\"&gt;Doab&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Krishna\"&gt;Krishna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tungabhadra\"&gt;Tungabhadra&lt;/a&gt;, and the Raja Purushottama Gajapati of &lt;a href=\"Odisha\"&gt;Odisha&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Tiruvannamalai\"&gt;Tiruvannamalai&lt;/a&gt;. Because of these losses, Virupaksha became increasingly unpopular and ignited many of the empire's provinces to rebel, eventually leading up to Virupaksha's death in the hands of his own son, Praudharaya in 1485. Praudharaya himself was not able to salvage the kingdom but an able general Saluva Narasimha took control of the empire in 1485 and helped to prevent its demise, though this change of power marked the end of the &lt;a href=\"Sangama%20Dynasty\"&gt;Sangama Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Saluva%20Dynasty\"&gt;Saluva Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.
