    "text": "The Standard Arabic Technical Transliteration System, commonly referred to by its acronym SATTS, is a system for writing and transmitting Arabic language text using the one-for-one substitution of ASCII-range characters for the letters of the Arabic alphabet. Unlike more common systems for transliterating Arabic, SATTS does not provide the reader with any more phonetic information than standard Arabic orthography does; that is, it provides the bare Arabic alphabetic spelling with no notation of short vowels, doubled consonants, etc. In other words, it is intended as a transliteration tool for Arabic linguists, and is of limited use to those who do not know Arabic.\nSATTS, a legacy of Morse and &lt;a href=\"teleprinter\"&gt;teleprinter&lt;/a&gt; systems (see \"Background,\" below), has historically been employed by military and communications elements of Western countries for handling Arabic text without the need for native fonts or special software. Although its use has decreased in recent years with the demise of &lt;a href=\"Morse%20code\"&gt;Morse code&lt;/a&gt; and the obsolescence of the teleprinter, and with the increased availability of native-font software, it is still used for the quick and handy platform-independent recording and transmission of Arabic terms and text.\nFormat.\nSATTS employs all the Latin alphabetic letters except P, plus four punctuation marks, for a total of 29 symbols (all the letters of the Arabic alphabet, plus the glottal-stop symbol hamzah).\nTable of SATTS equivalents.\nIn some words, &lt;a href=\"l%C4%81m%20%27alif\"&gt;l\u0101m 'alif&lt;/a&gt; was sent as a single character \u2022\u2014\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2014 or LA as a single character. The symbol for the glottal stop hamzah (\u0621) is written following its seat, if it has one. It is omitted when it occurs with an initial 'alif. \nRIEIS \u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 MAEDB? \u0645\u0623\u062f\u0628\u0629\nMSWEWL \u0645\u0633\u0624\u0648\u0644 BDE \u0628\u062f\u0621\nAHMD \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f ASLAM \u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\nSample text.\nThe chief deficiencies of SATTS are that it does not distinguish between h\u0101' (\u0647) and t\u0101' marb\u016b\u0163ah (\u0629), or between final y\u0101' (\u064a) and 'alif maks\u016brah (\u0649), and it cannot depict an 'alif maddah ( \u0622 ). SATTS also cannot distinguish between a final seated hamza and a final independent hamza, if the word ends in \"AE\", \"IE\", or \"WE\".\nBackground.\nThe Latin alphabetic letter employed for each Arabic letter in the SATTS system is its Morse-code equivalent. For example, &lt;a href=\"Morse%20code\"&gt;Morse code&lt;/a&gt; for the Arabic letter \u0163\u0101' (\u0637) is \u2022 \u2022 \u2014 (dit-dit-dah). That same Morse code sequence represents the letter U in the Latin alphabet. Hence the SATTS equivalent for \u0163\u0101' is U.\nIn the Morse-code era, when Arabic language Morse signals were copied down by non-Arab code clerks, the text came out in SATTS. Text in SATTS was also automatically produced when teleprinters reproduced Arabic text, if the technician had failed to replace the printer's Latin-character pallet with an Arabic-character one."
