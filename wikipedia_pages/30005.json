Since its inception, Wayra has backed over 300 companies including Trustev, Venddo, Cloudwear and NFWare.\nAs of 1 December 2014, the &lt;a href=\"Firefox\"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; web browser includes the \"&lt;a href=\"Firefox%20Hello\"&gt;Firefox Hello&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"WebRTC\"&gt;WebRTC&lt;/a&gt; feature, that allows real-time voice and video &lt;a href=\"online%20chat\"&gt;online chat&lt;/a&gt;s. \"Firefox Hello\" is powered by Telef\u00f3nica and was also co-developed by Telef\u00f3nica.\nIn September 2017, Nokia and Telef\u00f3nica signed an agreement in order to evaluate technologies enabling an efficient network evolution to 5G in line with Telef\u00f3nica's business objectives.\nMonopoly.\nTelef\u00f3nica has received several fines due to convictions over &lt;a href=\"unfair%20competition\"&gt;unfair competition&lt;/a&gt;, abuse of its position as dominant provider, and &lt;a href=\"Competition%20law\"&gt;antitrust violations&lt;/a&gt; through the Commission of Telecommunications, &lt;a href=\"European%20Commission\"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;, and Spanish tribunals. These fines include:\nAs of 2008, Telef\u00f3nica had in court two more fines, with a value of 793 million euros.\nOn 5 July 2007, the &lt;a href=\"European%20Commission\"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; ordered Telef\u00f3nica to pay a record antitrust fine of almost \u20ac152 million for activities in the Spanish broadband market which, according to European Union competition commissioner &lt;a href=\"Neelie%20Kroes\"&gt;Neelie Kroes&lt;/a&gt;, \"harmed Spanish &lt;a href=\"consumer\"&gt;consumer&lt;/a&gt;s, Spanish &lt;a href=\"business\"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;es and the Spanish &lt;a href=\"economy\"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt; as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy.\"\nSeveral consumer groups in Spain have reported unnecessary delays in cancelling Telef\u00f3nica's ADSL service. These consumer groups also claim that services continue to be billed after being cancelled and that service cancellation requests are ignored.\nThis has led Spanish people to organize themselves in consumer groups such as the \"Asociaci\u00f3n de Internautas\" and user communities like \"Bandaancha\" in order to defend themselves from Telef\u00f3nica's abuses and to give support and help to each other in their various complaints about Telef\u00f3nica's unfair practices.\nThe practices are claimed to include the complex process involved in cancelling lines.\nThese line cancellation procedures are justified by Telef\u00f3nica as a way of \"defending customers against hoaxes.\" Furthermore, in areas where ADSL lines are scarce, there are also reports of customers who claim to have had their service cancelled or inexplicably transferred to another customer although they have paid their bills.\nThis practice is considered by some to be used by Telef\u00f3nica in certain areas of Spain where there are few broadband connections.\nPositions on network neutrality.\nIn February 2010, Telef\u00f3nica &lt;a href=\"Chief%20executive%20officer\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9sar%20Alierta\"&gt;Cesar Alierta&lt;/a&gt; expressed in a meeting at &lt;a href=\"Bilbao\"&gt;Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; that his company intends to charge &lt;a href=\"Google\"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20search%20engines\"&gt;search engines&lt;/a&gt; for the use of their network. Alierta complained that such search engines were benefiting from the platform without contributing to the company's expenses and that such a trend will change in the near future. Additionally, he said that Telef\u00f3nica will seek to push its own content.\nInnovation.\nIn 2017, Telef\u00f3nica announced the launch of OnLife Networks, intended to infuse innovation into the company."
