He was attached to the same squad during his professional playing career. He was a member of the Munster team that won the &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Celtic%20League\"&gt;2002\u201303 Celtic League&lt;/a&gt; and was the winning captain during their &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Heineken%20Cup\"&gt;2005\u201306 Heineken Cup&lt;/a&gt; success. Foley played for &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; from 1995 until 2005 and captained the squad on three occasions.\nSchools rugby.\nIn March 1989, Foley led &lt;a href=\"St.%20Munchin%27s%20College\"&gt;St. Munchin's College&lt;/a&gt; to victory in the &lt;a href=\"Munster%20Schools%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Munster Schools Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt;. He later represented Munster and Ireland Schools on several occasions over two seasons, notably during the 1992 Irish Schools tour of New Zealand. Winning six games out of eight, Ireland narrowly lost the final game to a New Zealand side featuring &lt;a href=\"Jonah%20Lomu\"&gt;Jonah Lomu&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Number%208%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;number 8&lt;/a&gt;. A controversial &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Wilson%20%28sportsman%29\"&gt;Jeff Wilson&lt;/a&gt; penalty-goal won the game in the final minutes.\nClub career.\nFoley made his professional debut for &lt;a href=\"Munster%20Rugby\"&gt;Munster&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Ospreys%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Swansea&lt;/a&gt; in November 1995, a game that was also Munster's first ever &lt;a href=\"European%20Rugby%20Champions%20Cup\"&gt;Heineken Cup&lt;/a&gt; fixture.\nHe was in the Munster team that lost 8\u20139 to &lt;a href=\"Northampton%20Saints\"&gt;Northampton Saints&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2000 Heineken Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, and was again the runner-up when Munster lost 15\u20139 to &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20Tigers\"&gt;Leicester Tigers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2002 Heineken Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;. Foley was finally on the winning side when Munster won the &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Celtic%20League\"&gt;2002\u201303 Celtic League&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Galwey\"&gt;Mick Galwey&lt;/a&gt; resigned as Munster captain, Foley narrowly lost to &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Williams%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Jim Williams&lt;/a&gt; in a vote to decide the next captain. When Williams left Munster in 2005, Foley became the new captain, and in his first season in the position, he led Munster to victory over &lt;a href=\"Biarritz%20Olympique\"&gt;Biarritz Olympique&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2006 Heineken Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;. Foley had played in all but one of Munster's first 78 Heineken Cup games until a shoulder injury sustained during Munster's 21\u201319 victory over Leicester Tigers at &lt;a href=\"Welford%20Road%20Stadium\"&gt;Welford Road&lt;/a&gt; in their first game of the &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Heineken%20Cup\"&gt;2006\u201307 Heineken Cup&lt;/a&gt; caused him to miss his side's subsequent victory over &lt;a href=\"CS%20Bourgoin-Jallieu\"&gt;Bourgoin&lt;/a&gt;, as well as back-to-back games against &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20Blues\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt; in December 2006.\nHe stood down as captain at the beginning of the 2007\u201308 season, making way for &lt;a href=\"Paul%20O%27Connell\"&gt;Paul O'Connell&lt;/a&gt;. He was dropped for Munster's final fixtures of the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Heineken%20Cup\"&gt;2007\u201308 Heineken Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and announced his retirement for the end of the season.\nInternational career.\nFoley made his debut for &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Five%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;1995 Five Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt; on 21 January 1995.

He missed the &lt;a href=\"1999%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1999 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, but was selected for the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2003 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, featuring in two of the pool games against &lt;a href=\"Romania%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFoley captained Ireland three times: in 2001 against &lt;a href=\"Samoa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2002 against &lt;a href=\"Romania%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.

Foley signed a contract extension with Munster in May 2013. The following year it was announced that Foley would succeed &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Penney\"&gt;Rob Penney&lt;/a&gt; as Munster's head coach, signing a two-year contract that began on 1 July 2014.\nPersonal life and death.\nHe was married to Olive; the couple had two children.
