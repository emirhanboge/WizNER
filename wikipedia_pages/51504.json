    "text": "Dell Hathaway Hymes (June 7, 1927 in &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 November 13, 2009 in &lt;a href=\"Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Charlottesville, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;) was a &lt;a href=\"linguist\"&gt;linguist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sociolinguistics\"&gt;sociolinguist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anthropologist\"&gt;anthropologist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"folkloristics\"&gt;folklorist&lt;/a&gt; who established disciplinary foundations for the comparative, ethnographic study of language use. His research focused upon the languages of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Northwest\"&gt;Pacific Northwest&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the first to call the fourth subfield of anthropology \"&lt;a href=\"linguistic%20anthropology\"&gt;linguistic anthropology&lt;/a&gt;\" instead of \"&lt;a href=\"anthropological%20linguistics\"&gt;anthropological linguistics&lt;/a&gt;\". The terminological shift draws attention to the field's grounding in anthropology rather than in what, by that time, had already become an autonomous discipline (linguistics). In 1972 Hymes founded the &lt;a href=\"academic%20journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Language%20in%20Society\"&gt;Language in Society&lt;/a&gt;\" and served as its editor for 22 years. He was accused of sexual harassment in the later years of his tenure at the University of Pennsylvania.\nEarly life and education.\nHe was educated at &lt;a href=\"Reed%20College\"&gt;Reed College&lt;/a&gt;, studying under &lt;a href=\"David%20H.%20French\"&gt;David H. French&lt;/a&gt;; and, after a stint in prewar Korea, he graduated in 1950 . His work in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; as a decoder is part of what influenced him to become a &lt;a href=\"linguistics\"&gt;linguist&lt;/a&gt;. Hymes earned his &lt;a href=\"Ph.D.\"&gt;Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20University%20%28Bloomington%29\"&gt;Indiana University&lt;/a&gt; in 1955, and took a job at &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven at that young age, Hymes had a reputation as a strong linguist; his dissertation, completed in one year, was a &lt;a href=\"grammar\"&gt;grammar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kathlamet%20language\"&gt;Kathlamet language&lt;/a&gt; spoken near the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20River\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt; and known primarily from &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Boas\"&gt;Franz Boas&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s work at the end of the 19th century.\nHymes remained at Harvard for five years, leaving in 1960 to join the &lt;a href=\"faculty%20%28teaching%20staff%29\"&gt;faculty&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley\"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;. He spent five years at Berkeley as well, and then joined the Department of &lt;a href=\"Anthropology\"&gt;Anthropology&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; in 1965 (where he succeeded &lt;a href=\"A.%20Irving%20Hallowell\"&gt;A. Irving Hallowell&lt;/a&gt;). In 1972 he joined the Department of Folklore and Folklife and became &lt;a href=\"Dean%20%28education%29\"&gt;Dean&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Pennsylvania%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Education\"&gt;University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education&lt;/a&gt; in 1975.\nHe served as president of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Folklore%20Society\"&gt;American Folklore Society&lt;/a&gt; in 1973\u20134, of the &lt;a href=\"Linguistic%20Society%20of%20America\"&gt;Linguistic Society of America&lt;/a&gt; in 1982, of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Anthropological%20Association\"&gt;American Anthropological Association&lt;/a&gt; in 1983 - the last person to have held all three positions. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Guild%20of%20Scholars%20of%20The%20Episcopal%20Church\"&gt;Guild of Scholars of The Episcopal Church&lt;/a&gt;. While at Penn, Hymes was a founder of the &lt;a href=\"academic%20journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Language%20in%20Society\"&gt;Language in Society&lt;/a&gt;\". In 2006, he was awarded the Gold Medal of Philology. Hymes later joined the Departments of Anthropology and English at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, where he became the Commonwealth Professor of Anthropology and English, and from which he retired in 2000, continuing as emeritus professor until his death from complications of &lt;a href=\"Alzheimer%27s%20disease\"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; on November 13, 2009.\nHis spouse, &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Hymes\"&gt;Virginia Hymes&lt;/a&gt;, was also a sociolinguist and folklorist.\nInfluences on his work.\nHymes was influenced by a number of linguists, anthropologists and sociologists, notably &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Boas\"&gt;Franz Boas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Sapir\"&gt;Edward Sapir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Hoijer\"&gt;Harry Hoijer&lt;/a&gt; of the Americanist Tradition; &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Jakobson\"&gt;Roman Jakobson&lt;/a&gt; and others of the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Linguistic%20Circle\"&gt;Prague Linguistic Circle&lt;/a&gt;; sociologist &lt;a href=\"Erving%20Goffman\"&gt;Erving Goffman&lt;/a&gt; and anthropologist &lt;a href=\"Ray%20L.%20Birdwhistell\"&gt;Ray L. Birdwhistell&lt;/a&gt;, both his colleagues at Penn, and ethnomethodologists &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Garfinkel\"&gt;Harold Garfinkel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harvey%20Sacks\"&gt;Harvey Sacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emanuel%20Schegloff\"&gt;Emanuel Schegloff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gail%20Jefferson\"&gt;Gail Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;.\nHymes' career can be divided into at least two phases. In his early career Hymes adapted &lt;a href=\"Prague%20School\"&gt;Prague School&lt;/a&gt; Functionalism to American &lt;a href=\"Linguistic%20Anthropology\"&gt;Linguistic Anthropology&lt;/a&gt;, pioneering the study of the relationship between language and social context. Together with &lt;a href=\"John%20Gumperz\"&gt;John Gumperz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erving%20Goffman\"&gt;Erving Goffman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20Labov\"&gt;William Labov&lt;/a&gt;, Hymes defined a broad multidisciplinary concern with language in society.\nHymes' later work focuses on poetics, particularly the poetic organization of Native American oral narratives. He and &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Tedlock\"&gt;Dennis Tedlock&lt;/a&gt; defined &lt;a href=\"ethnopoetics\"&gt;ethnopoetics&lt;/a&gt; as a field of study within linguistic anthropology and folkloristics. Hymes considers literary critic &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Burke\"&gt;Kenneth Burke&lt;/a&gt; his biggest influence on this latter work, saying, \"My sense of what I do probably owes more to KB than to anyone else\". Hymes studied with Burke in the 1950s. Burke's work was theoretically and topically diverse, but the idea that seems most influential on Hymes is the application of rhetorical criticism to poetry.\nHymes has included many other literary figures and critics among his influences, including &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Alter\"&gt;Robert Alter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"C.%20S.%20Lewis\"&gt;C. S. Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A.%20L.%20Kroeber\"&gt;A. L. Kroeber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claude%20L%C3%A9vi-Strauss\"&gt;Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss&lt;/a&gt;.\nSignificance of his work.\nAs one of the first sociolinguists, Hymes helped to pioneer the connection between &lt;a href=\"Speech%20communication\"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"social%20relations\"&gt;social relations&lt;/a&gt; placing linguistic anthropology at the center of the &lt;a href=\"performative%20turn\"&gt;performative turn&lt;/a&gt; within anthropology and the social sciences more generally.\nHymes formulated a response to &lt;a href=\"Noam%20Chomsky\"&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;'s influential distinction between &lt;a href=\"Linguistic%20competence\"&gt;competence&lt;/a&gt; (knowledge of grammatical rules necessary to decoding and producing language) and &lt;a href=\"linguistic%20performance\"&gt;performance&lt;/a&gt; (actual language use in context). Hymes objected to the marginalization of performance from the center of linguistic inquiry and proposed the notion of &lt;a href=\"communicative%20competence\"&gt;communicative competence&lt;/a&gt;, or knowledge necessary to use language in social context, as an object of linguistic inquiry. Since appropriate language use is conventionally defined, and varies across different communities, much of Hymes early work frames a project for ethnographic investigation into contrasting patterns of language use across &lt;a href=\"speech%20communities\"&gt;speech communities&lt;/a&gt;. Hymes termed this approach \"the ethnography of speaking.\" The SPEAKING acronym, described below, was presented as a lighthearted heuristic to aid fieldworkers in their attempt to document and analyze instances of language in use, which he termed \"speech events.\" Embedded in the acronym is an application and extension of Jakobson's arguments concerning the multifunctionality of language. He articulated other, more technical, often typologically oriented approaches to variation in patterns of language use across speech communities in a series of articles.\nAs a result of discussions primarily with &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Birdwhistell\"&gt;Ray Birdwhistell&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, in his later work, Hymes renamed the \"ethnography of speaking\" the \"&lt;a href=\"ethnography%20of%20communication\"&gt;ethnography of communication&lt;/a&gt;\" to reflect the broadening of focus from instances of language production to the ways in which communication (including oral, written, broadcast, acts of receiving/listening) is conventionalized in a given community of users, and to include nonverbal as well as verbal behavior.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Erving%20Goffman\"&gt;Erving Goffman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Szwed\"&gt;John Szwed&lt;/a&gt;, he established the Center for Urban Ethnography in 1969. The goal was to fund research by both faculty and students at Penn that used urban ethnography as the primary method, and much innovative research resulted. The first major grant came from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Institute%20of%20Mental%20Health\"&gt;National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;, funding much research emphasizing different racial and ethnic groups; the second from the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20National%20Institute%20of%20Education\"&gt;U.S. National Institute of Education&lt;/a&gt;, funding classroom ethnography. With &lt;a href=\"Erving%20Goffman\"&gt;Erving Goffman&lt;/a&gt; he co-edited the series Conduct and Communication for the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Pennsylvania%20Press\"&gt;University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/a&gt; as a way to support research they considered most valuable.\nHymes promoted what he and others call \"&lt;a href=\"ethnopoetics\"&gt;ethnopoetics&lt;/a&gt;\", an anthropological method of transcribing and analyzing folklore and &lt;a href=\"oral%20literature\"&gt;oral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"narrative\"&gt;narrative&lt;/a&gt; that pays attention to poetic structures within speech. In reading the transcriptions of Indian &lt;a href=\"Mythology\"&gt;myths&lt;/a&gt;, for example, which were generally recorded as &lt;a href=\"prose\"&gt;prose&lt;/a&gt; by the anthropologists who came before, Hymes noticed that there are commonly &lt;a href=\"poetry\"&gt;poetic&lt;/a&gt; structures in the wording and structuring of the tale. Patterns of words and word use follow patterned, artistic forms.\nHymes' goal, in his own mind, is to understand the artistry and \"the &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;competence&lt;/a&gt;... that underlies and informs such narratives\" (Hymes 2003:vii). He created the Dell Hymes Model of Speaking and coined the term &lt;a href=\"communicative%20competence\"&gt;communicative competence&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"language%20education\"&gt;language education&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to being entertaining stories or important myths about the nature of the world, narratives also convey the importance of aboriginal environmental management knowledge such as fish spawning cycles in local rivers or the disappearance of &lt;a href=\"grizzly%20bear\"&gt;grizzly bear&lt;/a&gt;s from Oregon. Hymes believes that all narratives in the world are organized around implicit principles of &lt;a href=\"Substantial%20form\"&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; which convey important knowledge and ways of thinking and of viewing the world. He argues that understanding narratives will lead to a fuller understanding of the language itself and those fields informed by storytelling, in which he includes ethnopoetics, sociolinguistics, &lt;a href=\"psycholinguistics\"&gt;psycholinguistics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rhetoric\"&gt;rhetoric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"semiotics\"&gt;semiotics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pragmatics\"&gt;pragmatics&lt;/a&gt;, narrative inquiry and &lt;a href=\"literary%20criticism\"&gt;literary criticism&lt;/a&gt;.\nHymes clearly considers &lt;a href=\"folklore\"&gt;folklore&lt;/a&gt; and narrative a vital part of the fields of &lt;a href=\"linguistics\"&gt;linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, anthropology and &lt;a href=\"literature\"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt;, and has bemoaned the fact that so few scholars in those fields are willing and able to adequately include folklore in its original language in their considerations (Hymes 1981:6\u20137). He feels that the translated versions of the stories are inadequate for understanding their role in the social or mental system in which they existed. He provides an example that in &lt;a href=\"Navajo%20language\"&gt;Navajo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"grammatical%20particle\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; (utterances such as \"uh,\" \"So,\" \"Well,\" etc. that have linguistic if not &lt;a href=\"semantic\"&gt;semantic&lt;/a&gt; meaning), omitted in the English translation, are essential to understanding how the story is shaped and how repetition defines the structure that the text embodies.\nHymes was the founding editor for the journal \"Language in Society\", which he edited for 22 years.\nThe \"S-P-E-A-K-I-N-G\" model.\nHymes developed a valuable model to assist the identification and labeling of components of linguistic interaction that was driven by his view that, in order to speak a language correctly, one needs not only to learn its vocabulary and grammar, but also the context in which words are used.\nThe model had sixteen components that can be applied to many sorts of discourse: message form; message content; setting; scene; speaker/sender; addressor; hearer/receiver/audience; addressee; purposes (outcomes); purposes (goals); key; channels; forms of speech; norms of interaction; norms of interpretation; and genres.\nHymes constructed the &lt;a href=\"acronym\"&gt;acronym&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"SPEAKING\"&gt;SPEAKING&lt;/a&gt;, under which he grouped the sixteen components within eight divisions:\nSetting and scene.\n\"Setting refers to the time and place of a speech act and, in general, to the physical circumstances\" - The living room in the grandparents' home might be a setting for a family story. Scene is the \"psychological setting\" or \"cultural definition\" of a setting, including characteristics such as range of formality and sense of play or seriousness. The family story may be told at a reunion celebrating the grandparents' anniversary. At times, the family would be festive and playful; at other times, serious and commemorative.\nParticipants.\nSpeaker and audience - Linguists will make distinctions within these categories; for example, the audience can be distinguished as addressees and other hearers. At the family reunion, an aunt might tell a story to the young female relatives, but males, although not addressed, might also hear the narrative.\nEnds.\nPurposes, goals, and outcomes - The aunt may tell a story about the grandmother to entertain the audience, teach the young women, and honor the grandmother.\nAct sequence.\nForm and order of the event - The aunt's story might begin as a response to a toast to the grandmother. The story's plot and development would have a sequence structured by the aunt. Possibly there would be a collaborative interruption during the telling. Finally, the group might applaud the tale and move onto another subject or activity.\nKey.\nClues that establish the \"tone, manner, or spirit\" of the speech act - The aunt might imitate the grandmother's voice and gestures in a playful way, or she might address the group in a serious voice emphasizing the sincerity and respect of the praise the story expresses.\nInstrumentalities.\nForms and styles of speech - The aunt might speak in a casual register with many dialect features or might use a more formal register and careful grammatically \"standard\" forms.\nNorms.\nSocial rules governing the event and the participants' actions and reaction - In a playful story by the aunt, the norms might allow many audience interruptions and collaboration, or possibly those interruptions might be limited to participation by older females. A serious, formal story by the aunt might call for attention to her and no interruptions as norms.\nGenre.\nThe kind of speech act or event; for the example used here, the kind of story - The aunt might tell a character anecdote about the grandmother for entertainment, or an &lt;a href=\"exemplum\"&gt;exemplum&lt;/a&gt; as moral instruction. Different disciplines develop terms for kinds of speech acts, and speech communities sometimes have their own terms for types."
