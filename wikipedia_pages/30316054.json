    "text": "Grover David Powell (October 10, 1940 \u2013 May 21, 1985) was an American &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"baseball%20player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; who appeared in 20 &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"games%20pitched\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; in . Born in &lt;a href=\"Sayre%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Sayre, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, he threw and batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nEarly years.\nAs a sophomore at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, Powell went 4\u20130, and led all &lt;a href=\"college%20baseball\"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; pitchers nationwide with 166 &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt;s, still a Penn record. He also hurled a &lt;a href=\"no-hitter\"&gt;no-hitter&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Lafayette%20College\"&gt;Lafayette College&lt;/a&gt;. His behavior, however, led coach &lt;a href=\"Jack%20McCloskey\"&gt;Jack McCloskey&lt;/a&gt; to kick him off the team. The Mets took a chance, signing Powell before &lt;a href=\"1962%20New%20York%20Mets%20season\"&gt;their inaugural season&lt;/a&gt; in regardless of the fact that he hadn't pitched since his sophomore year.\nUsed as both a &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;starter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"relief%20pitcher\"&gt;relief pitcher&lt;/a&gt; in his first &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional&lt;/a&gt; season with the &lt;a href=\"Auburn%20Mets\"&gt;Auburn Mets&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Syracuse%20Chiefs\"&gt;Syracuse Chiefs&lt;/a&gt;, Powell compiled a 4\u201312 record with a 5.45 &lt;a href=\"Earned%20run%20average\"&gt;Earned run average&lt;/a&gt; and 121 strikeouts in 114 &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings pitched&lt;/a&gt;. Used more strictly as a starter in 1963 with the &lt;a href=\"Raleigh%20Mets\"&gt;Raleigh Mets&lt;/a&gt;, Powell improved to 5\u20136 with a far more respectable 3.07 ERA.\nNew York Mets.\nThe Mets called Powell up in July 1963. With the Mets behind 11\u20132 to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;, Powell made his major league debut in the ninth &lt;a href=\"inning\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt; on July 13. Though he gave up two &lt;a href=\"base%20on%20balls\"&gt;walks&lt;/a&gt;, Powell escaped his one inning of work without further damage. Despite this modest success, Powell was used strictly in \"mop up duty\" by Mets &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Casey%20Stengel\"&gt;Casey Stengel&lt;/a&gt; through his first five appearances. In all five cases, the Mets were down a minimum of five &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; when Powell was called upon to close out the game.\nPowell had a 1.88 ERA and sixteen strikeouts over 13 innings pitched when he was given his first opportunity to &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;start&lt;/a&gt; on August 20 against the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt;, who were coming off an eight-game winning streak. Powell and Phillies starter &lt;a href=\"Cal%20McLish\"&gt;Cal McLish&lt;/a&gt; engaged in a pitchers' duel through the first seven innings before the Mets finally broke through for two runs in the eighth and two more in the ninth. Powell allowed four &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; and four walks, while striking out six in a &lt;a href=\"complete-game\"&gt;complete-game&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shutout%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;shutout&lt;/a&gt;. After escaping a bases loaded jam in the sixth, Powell did not allow another base runner. It would turn out to be his only Major League win.\nIn his next start on August 27, Powell was holding onto a 1\u20130 lead over the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Donn%20Clendenon\"&gt;Donn Clendenon&lt;/a&gt; lined a pitch off Powell's cheek. He remained in the game through the end of the inning. Afterwards, he was taken to Presbyterian University Hospital for X-rays. The Pirates would come back to win upon his departure.\nHis five innings of shutout ball against the Pirates lowered his season ERA to 0.95. From there, Powell pitched to a 5.06 ERA over the remainder of the season. He took his only career loss on September 5 against the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;. All told, he went 1\u20131 with a 2.72 ERA. He struck out 39, allowed 37 &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; and 32 &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt; in 49 innings pitched.\nAfter the majors.\nPowell remained in the Mets' &lt;a href=\"farm%20system\"&gt;farm system&lt;/a&gt; through . &lt;a href=\"Tendinitis\"&gt;Tendinitis&lt;/a&gt; limited him to just 42 innings, and cost him the entire season. He joined the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; in , and seemed poised to return to the majors. In , he pitched 188 innings, and went 16\u20136 with a 2.54 ERA for the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20League%20%281964%E2%80%932020%29\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Asheville%20Tourists\"&gt;Asheville Tourists&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was limited to just 45 innings in . Midway during the 1969 season, he was dealt to the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt; for former major league &lt;a href=\"infielder\"&gt;infielder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mike%20de%20la%20Hoz\"&gt;Mike de la Hoz&lt;/a&gt;. As a minor leaguer with the Braves, Powell went 1\u20137 with a 7.60 ERA through the season before retiring.\nHaving left school to pitch for the Mets, he returned to the University of Pennsylvania to complete his degree in economics in 1966. In 1985, while visiting his son in the hospital, Powell was diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"leukemia\"&gt;leukemia&lt;/a&gt;. He died later that year.\nExternal links.\n, or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//ultimatemets.com/profile.php%3FPlayerCode%3D0062\"&gt;The Ultimate Mets Database&lt;/a&gt;"
