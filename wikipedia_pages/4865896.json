It lies approximately south-west of &lt;a href=\"Pszczyna\"&gt;Pszczyna&lt;/a&gt; and south of the regional capital &lt;a href=\"Katowice\"&gt;Katowice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe village has a population of 2,690.\nHistory.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the area was part of the territory of the &lt;a href=\"Vistulans\"&gt;Vistulans&lt;/a&gt; tribe, one of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20tribes\"&gt;Polish tribes&lt;/a&gt;. It became part of the emerging &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Poland%20%28966%E2%80%931025%29\"&gt;Polish state&lt;/a&gt; in the 10th century. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it was part of the Polish &lt;a href=\"Seniorate%20Province\"&gt;Seniorate Province&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Racib%C3%B3rz\"&gt;Duchy of Racib\u00f3rz&lt;/a&gt;. The village was first mentioned in the 14th century.\nAfterwards, the village passed under &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemian (Czech)&lt;/a&gt; suzerainty, and in the 15th century, it became part of the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Pszczyna\"&gt;Duchy of Pszczyna&lt;/a&gt;. During the political upheaval caused by &lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Corvinus\"&gt;Matthias Corvinus&lt;/a&gt; the duchy was overtaken in 1480 by &lt;a href=\"Casimir%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cieszyn\"&gt;Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Piast%20dynasty\"&gt;Piast dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, who sold it in 1517 to the Hungarian &lt;a href=\"magnate\"&gt;magnate&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Thurz%C3%B3\"&gt;Thurz\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; family, forming the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Pless\"&gt;Pless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"state%20country\"&gt;state country&lt;/a&gt;. In the accompanying sales document issued on 21 February 1517 the village was mentioned as \"Luka\". Along with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1526, it became part of the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg Monarchy&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession\"&gt;War of the Austrian Succession&lt;/a&gt; most of Silesia was conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Kingdom of Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, including the village, and in 1871 it became part of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, Poland regained independence, and following the subsequent Polish &lt;a href=\"Silesian%20Uprisings\"&gt;Silesian Uprisings&lt;/a&gt; against Germany, the village was reintegrated with the reborn Polish state.\nTransport.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Voivodeship%20road\"&gt;Voivodeship road&lt;/a&gt; 939 runs through the village and &lt;a href=\"National%20road%2081%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;National road 1&lt;/a&gt; runs nearby, east of the village.\nSports.\nThe local &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team is LKS \u0141\u0105ka.
