    "text": "\"If The Good Lord's Willing and The Creek Don't Rise\" is a 1955 American country song by &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Reed\"&gt;Jerry Reed&lt;/a&gt; which was particularly popularized by the 1958 recording of &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Cash\"&gt;Johnny Cash&lt;/a&gt; and has been covered by multiple artists.\nLyrics.\nThe lyrics play on the expression &lt;a href=\"The%20creek%20don%27t%20rise\"&gt;Lord willing and the creek don't rise&lt;/a&gt;, which is thought to originate from Alabama. The catchphrase itself was associated with &lt;a href=\"Hank%20Williams\"&gt;Hank Williams&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Stuart\"&gt;Marty Stuart&lt;/a&gt; places the words \"If the Good Lord's willin' and the creek don't rise, we'll see you in the mornin'.\" in Williams' mouth in his tribute album \"&lt;a href=\"Hillbilly%20Heaven\"&gt;Hillbilly Heaven&lt;/a&gt;\". In the Reed song and Cash cover the verses vary the rhyme, so the opening line commences:\nBut in following verses the rhyme changes through \"creeks don't rise\", \"creek stay low\", back to \"creeks don't rise\".\nThe expression is incorrectly attributed on modern social media to an Indian agent, &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Hawkins\"&gt;Benjamin Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;, in the late 18th century in a rumored letter not found in any archive to the U.S. President. In response to a request that he return to Washington D.C., he wrote, \"God willing and the Creek don't rise.\" However, the first President to move to Washington was &lt;a href=\"John%20Adams\"&gt;John Adams&lt;/a&gt; on 1 November 1800. The capitalization of the word Creek supposedly referred to the Creek Indian tribe rather than a body of water.\nVersions.\n\"By date order (spelling and titling may vary)\":"
