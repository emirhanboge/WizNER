    "text": "The Enchantress (or The Sorceress, ) is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; in four acts by &lt;a href=\"Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky\"&gt;Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&lt;/a&gt; based on the &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ippolit%20Shpazhinsky\"&gt;Ippolit Shpazhinsky&lt;/a&gt;, using his drama with the same title. The opera was composed between September 1885 and May 1887 in Maidanovo (a village in the &lt;a href=\"Klin%2C%20Klinsky%20District%2C%20Moscow%20Oblast\"&gt;Klin&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;) and was first performed in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; in 1887.\nComposition history.\n&lt;a href=\"Ippolit%20Shpazhinsky\"&gt;Ippolit Shpazhinsky&lt;/a&gt;'s play \"The Enchantress\" was first produced in 1884 at the &lt;a href=\"Maly%20Theatre%20%28Moscow%29\"&gt;Maly Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow, and soon it had seen more performances than any other play being staged in Moscow or &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;. The actresses &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Yermolova\"&gt;Maria Yermolova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Savina\"&gt;Maria Savina&lt;/a&gt; were prominent in the title role of Nastasya (\"Kuma\"). &lt;a href=\"Modest%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky\"&gt;Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky&lt;/a&gt; admired \"The Enchantress\" and one scene in particular. He pointed it out to his brother the composer, who proceeded to write a duet based on that scene. Pyotr saw the play himself in January 1885, after which he wrote to Shpazhinsky, asking him to convert the drama to an opera libretto. Shpazhinsky agreed, and the two men met that month to discuss the project, but the librettist's work was delayed by his divorce proceedings. When the libretto was finally completed in August, it was far too long and Tchaikovsky had to radically cut it. Even so, this opera was still the longest work he wrote.\nPerformance history.\nThe world premiere was given on 1 November 1887 [OS 20 October] at the &lt;a href=\"Mariinsky%20Theatre\"&gt;Mariinsky Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the composer and with stage direction by Osip Palechek (Josef Pale\u010dek), set designs by Mikhail Bocharov; and costume designs by E. Ponomaryov. After one season it was dropped from the repertoire. The sets and costumes were sent to Moscow where the opera received a single performance on 2 February 1890 [OS]. There was a second production at the &lt;a href=\"Bolshoi%20Theatre\"&gt;Bolshoi Theatre&lt;/a&gt; on 25 January 1916 [OS], but this remained in the repertoire only until the end of the year. A third production at the Bolshoi in 1958 received 49 performances and remained in the repertoire until 1965. The British premiere was given by New Sussex Opera in May 1996 as part of the Brighton Festival. The latest production at the Bolshoi was premiered in 2012\n A new production of \"Charodeyka\" directed by &lt;a href=\"Christof%20Loy\"&gt;Christof Loy&lt;/a&gt; opened the 2014/2015 season of &lt;a href=\"Theater%20an%20der%20Wien\"&gt;Theater an der Wien&lt;/a&gt; on 14 September 2014 with &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Tatarnikov\"&gt;Mikhail Tatarnikov&lt;/a&gt; conducting the ORF &lt;a href=\"Radio-Symphonieorchester%20Wien\"&gt;Radio-Symphonieorchester Wien&lt;/a&gt;. The French premiere was given in March 2019 at the &lt;a href=\"Op%C3%A9ra%20de%20Lyon\"&gt;Opera de Lyon&lt;/a&gt; conducted by &lt;a href=\"Daniele%20Rustioni\"&gt;Daniele Rustioni&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Guseva\"&gt;Elena Guseva&lt;/a&gt; in the title role.\nInstrumentation.\nSource: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.tchaikovsky-research.net/pages/The_Enchantress\"&gt;Tchaikovsky Research&lt;/a&gt;\nSynopsis.\n\"Time\": The last quarter of the 15th century\n\"Place\": &lt;a href=\"Nizhny%20Novgorod\"&gt;Nizhny Novgorod&lt;/a&gt; and its vicinity\nThe action takes place at the last quarter of the 15th century at a tavern and brothel near Nizhny Novgorod. Nastasya (Kuma), the charming owner of the inn, has made herself an enemy in rejecting the devious Mam\u00efrov, the right-hand man of the local governor Nikita Danilovich Kurlyatev. He spreads the gossip that Nastasya is an enchantress, and every man whom she meets falls for her. Yuriy, Nikita's son, begins to frequent the inn, as does his father, who falls madly in love with Nastasya (without any success), who threatens her that he will reach his goal by whatever means. Mam\u00efrov confronts Nikita's wife, Yevpraksiya, with the truth, while her son \u2013 not yet personally involved with Nastasya \u2013 swears to avenge his mother. While confronting Nastasya he learns that it is he whom she loves. They both plan to flee during the night not knowing that, by now, Mam\u00efrov has worked out an elaborate plot to wreak his revenge on Nastasya as well as on Nikita and his family with devastating effect.\nVersions by other hands.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, the opera was staged again with a new version of the libretto by &lt;a href=\"Sergey%20Gorodetsky\"&gt;Sergey Gorodetsky&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Ippolit%20Shpazhinsky\"&gt;Ippolit Shpazhinsky&lt;/a&gt; on 22 March 1941 in &lt;a href=\"St%20Petersburg\"&gt;Leningrad&lt;/a&gt; (St Petersburg)."
