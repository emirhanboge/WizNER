    "text": "The Fort Worth Stockyards is a &lt;a href=\"historic%20district%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;historic district&lt;/a&gt; that is located in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Fort Worth, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, north of the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Fort%20Worth\"&gt;central business district&lt;/a&gt;. A portion encompassing much of the district was listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; as Fort Worth Stockyards Historic District in 1976. It holds a former livestock market which operated under various owners from 1866. \nHistory.\nThe arrival of &lt;a href=\"railroad\"&gt;railroad&lt;/a&gt;s in 1876 made the area a very important &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; center. Fort Worth Union Stockyards opened for business on January 19, 1890, covering 206 acres. On February 7, the Fort Worth Dressed Meat and Packing Company was founded. This facility was operated without profit until purchased by G. W. Simpson of &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;. In an effort to produce revenue, they reached out to the Swift and Armour companies to establish &lt;a href=\"packing%20house\"&gt;packing house&lt;/a&gt;s. By 1886, four stockyards had been built near the railroads. Boston capitalist Greenleif W. Simpson, with a half dozen Boston and Chicago associates, incorporated the Fort Worth Stock Yards Company on March 23, 1893, and purchased the Union Stock Yards and the Fort Worth Packing Company. The Stockyards experienced early success. By 1907, the Stockyards sold a million cattle per year. The stockyards was an organized place where cattle, sheep, and hogs could be bought, sold and slaughtered. Fort Worth remained an important part of the &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt; industry until the 1950s. Business suffered due to livestock auctions held closer to where the livestock were originally produced.\nToday.\nThe Fort Worth Stockyards now celebrates Fort Worth's long tradition as a part of the cattle industry and was listed on the National Register as a historical district in 1976. The listing included 46 &lt;a href=\"contributing%20buildings\"&gt;contributing buildings&lt;/a&gt; and one other &lt;a href=\"contributing%20structure\"&gt;contributing structure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Recorded%20Texas%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;Recorded Texas Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt;s within the district include the entrance sign, the Livestock Exchange Building, and the Thannisch Block Building housing the Stockyards Hotel. &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Antiquities%20Landmark\"&gt;State Antiquities Landmarks&lt;/a&gt; also include the entrance sign as well as the Armour &amp; Swift Plaza and the Cowtown Coliseum.\nThe Stockyards consist of mainly entertainment and shopping venues that capitalize on the \"Cowtown\" image of Fort Worth. Home to the famous boot making company M.L. Leddy's which is located in the heart of the Stockyards and The Maverick Fine Western Wear and Saloon where customers \"can 'belly up' to the bar, relax and have a cold beer while in the Stockyards; just like they did in the days of the big cattle drives\", as they shop around the store. The city of Fort Worth is often referred to as \"Where the West Begins.\" Many &lt;a href=\"Bar%20%28establishment%29\"&gt;bars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nightclub\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt;s (including &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Bob%27s\"&gt;Billy Bob's Texas&lt;/a&gt;) are located in the vicinity, and the area has a Western &lt;a href=\"Motif%20%28art%29\"&gt;motif&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an &lt;a href=\"opry\"&gt;opry&lt;/a&gt; and the weekly Stockyards Championship &lt;a href=\"Rodeo\"&gt;Rodeo&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Congress\"&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt; states in their notes ~ \"They are the last standing stockyards in the United States.\" Some volunteers still run the cattle drives through the stockyards, a practice developed in the late 19th century by the frontiersman &lt;a href=\"Charles%20%26quot%3BBuffalo%26quot%3B%20Jones\"&gt;Charles \"Buffalo\" Jones&lt;/a&gt;, who herded &lt;a href=\"American%20bison\"&gt;buffalo&lt;/a&gt; calves through the streets of &lt;a href=\"Garden%20City%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Garden City, Kansas&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn April 1, 2011, the Fort Worth Stockyards Stables were remodeled and reopened. They are located next door to the Hyatt hotel in an original Historic Stockyards building that was built in 1912. Moved to the Armour building after the 2015 remodel. The stables offers horse rentals on the open trails of the Trinity River and carriage rides. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Grapevine%20Vintage%20Railroad\"&gt;Grapevine Vintage Railroad&lt;/a&gt; runs a &lt;a href=\"heritage%20railway\"&gt;heritage railway&lt;/a&gt; service between &lt;a href=\"Grapevine%20station\"&gt;Grapevine station&lt;/a&gt; and The Stockyards."
