    "text": "Cibulka (feminine Cibulkov\u00e1) is a widespread name in the former Czechoslovakia as well as throughout the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, where it was frequently spelt Czibulka according to the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Latin%20digraphs%23C\"&gt;older Hungarian orthography&lt;/a&gt;. It may originate from a diminutive of the Czech word cibule, meaning \"onion.\""
