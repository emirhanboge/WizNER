    "text": "Hans-Joachim Merker (7 October 1929 \u2013 18 August 2014) was a German physician and &lt;a href=\"anatomy\"&gt;anatomist&lt;/a&gt;. He was Professor of Anatomy at the &lt;a href=\"Free%20University%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;Free University of Berlin&lt;/a&gt; from 1972 to 1998, and served as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine from 1980 to 1981. He was noted for his research on the fine structure of &lt;a href=\"connective%20tissue\"&gt;connective tissue&lt;/a&gt;, the morphology of &lt;a href=\"hormone\"&gt;hormone&lt;/a&gt; effects, and &lt;a href=\"Embryology\"&gt;embryological&lt;/a&gt; and embryotoxic problems, and his research was central in the development of medical research utilising &lt;a href=\"electron%20microscopy\"&gt;electron microscopy&lt;/a&gt;. Hans Georg Baumgarten noted on his death that he was \"not only a chair-holder, but a philosopher, humanist, anthropologist, developmental biologist, transdisciplinary scholar and scientist\".\nBackground and education.\nMerker was born in &lt;a href=\"Merseburg\"&gt;Merseburg&lt;/a&gt;, the son of a &lt;a href=\"general%20practitioner\"&gt;general practitioner&lt;/a&gt;. The Russian occupation saw his father thrown in jail by the &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communists&lt;/a&gt;, and as a son of an academic, he was banned from studying at universities in the &lt;a href=\"German%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;Russian occupation zone&lt;/a&gt;. In December 1948, at 19, he enrolled as one of the first students at the newly established Free University of Berlin, which was founded in the same month with American support in &lt;a href=\"West%20Berlin\"&gt;West Berlin&lt;/a&gt; in response to the suppression of academic freedom by the communists at the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20University\"&gt;Humboldt University&lt;/a&gt;. He initially studied &lt;a href=\"art%20history\"&gt;art history&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"archeology\"&gt;archeology&lt;/a&gt;, as the Free University did not yet have a preclinical medical programme. He started his studies of medicine in 1950 and settled permanently in West Berlin before the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Wall\"&gt;Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt;, after which he did not see his parents for many years. He stayed for his entire career with the Free University, which he would later describe as \"an island of &lt;a href=\"Free%20World\"&gt;freedom&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nCareer.\nMerker graduated as a physician at the Free University of Berlin in 1956. In 1957, he was employed at the Research Department of Electron Microscopy, which was headed by &lt;a href=\"Willy%20Schwarz\"&gt;Willy Schwarz&lt;/a&gt;, at the Institute of Anatomy at the Free University of Berlin. He obtained his doctorate (Dr.med.) in 1958 and his &lt;a href=\"Habilitation\"&gt;Habilitation&lt;/a&gt; in 1964, and was appointed as Adjunct Professor (\"&lt;a href=\"au%C3%9Ferplanm%C3%A4%C3%9Figer%20Professor\"&gt;au\u00dferplanm\u00e4\u00dfiger Professor&lt;/a&gt;\") at the Free University of Berlin in 1968. In 1969, he became director of the Research Department of Electron Microscopy. He held the first &lt;a href=\"chair%20%28academic%29\"&gt;chair&lt;/a&gt; in anatomy from 1972 to 1998, in succession to &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20von%20Herrath\"&gt;Ernst von Herrath&lt;/a&gt;. He also served as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine from 1980 to 1981, and was director of the Institute of Anatomy until 1998. He was a visiting scholar for one year at the &lt;a href=\"Weizmann%20Institute%20of%20Science\"&gt;Weizmann Institute of Science&lt;/a&gt; in Israel in 1965, and was subsequently a visiting scholar at universities in England and Sweden. He wrote more than 250 scientific papers. He became Professor Emeritus in 1998, and died in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; in 2014."
