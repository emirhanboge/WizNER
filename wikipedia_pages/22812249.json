Some of the tribe leaders fought &lt;a href=\"French%20Mandate%20for%20Syria%20and%20the%20Lebanon\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and English colonialism, such as the leader &lt;a href=\"Ayyash%20Al-Haj\"&gt;Ayyash Al-Haj&lt;/a&gt;, who was exiled by the &lt;a href=\"French%20Mandate%20for%20Syria%20and%20the%20Lebanon\"&gt;French authorities&lt;/a&gt; with his family to the city of &lt;a href=\"Jableh\"&gt;Jableh&lt;/a&gt; in 1925 and executed some of his sons after being accused of preparing a revolution in &lt;a href=\"Deir%20el-Zour\"&gt;Deir el-Zour&lt;/a&gt; to relieve pressure on the area of &lt;a href=\"Jabal%20al-Arab\"&gt;Jabal al-Arab&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Syrian%20Revolution\"&gt;Great Syrian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in 1925.\nAfter the formation of the Syrian state, Minister Mohamed Al-Ayesh emerged as the first minister in the Eastern Province and continued for many years and was known as a man of ministries.\nIn the modern era, Baggara tribespeople supported the &lt;a href=\"Baath%20Arab%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Baath&lt;/a&gt; and Nasserist parties, One tribesman from the Abdulkarim clan, Yassin Al-Hafiz (1930\u201378), noted for his intellectualism, served as an architect of &lt;a href=\"Baath%20party%20ideology\"&gt;Baath party ideology&lt;/a&gt;. A large number of tribespeople belong to the Baath wings in both &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, and The Baggara tribe also includes members of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party\"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany of Baggara tribespeople joined the &lt;a href=\"Baath%20Party%20%28Syria%29\"&gt;Baath Party&lt;/a&gt; primarily for benefits and government employment, But many quickly turned against the regime and joined the 2011 uprising; during this period of anti-Assad activism, &lt;a href=\"Sheikh\"&gt;Sheikh&lt;/a&gt; Nawaf Ragheb Al-Bashir delivered anti-regime speeches attended by tribespeople who traveled to &lt;a href=\"Deir%20al-Zour\"&gt;Deir al-Zour&lt;/a&gt; from their nearby &lt;a href=\"villages\"&gt;villages&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, Sheikh Nawaf joined the Party of Socialist Unitarians and called for &lt;a href=\"pan-Arabism\"&gt;pan-Arabism&lt;/a&gt;; then he supported &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Shia\"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; ideology and the &lt;a href=\"Shia\"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"coalition\"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt;\nin &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;.\nCelebrities of Tribe.\nFadel Al-Aboud.\nFadel Aboud Al-Hassan or Haj Fadel Al-Aboud, a &lt;a href=\"Syrians\"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; leader and head of the &lt;a href=\"Haj%20Fadel%20Government\"&gt;Haj Fadel Government&lt;/a&gt; in eastern &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottomans&lt;/a&gt; left the region in 1918.\n&lt;a href=\"Fadel%20Al-Aboud\"&gt;Al-Hassan&lt;/a&gt; was born in Deir al-Zour in 1872 for Al-Hassan family from the Abo Obaid &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; from Al-Baggara &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fadel%20Al-Aboud\"&gt;Al-Hassan&lt;/a&gt; was of high social standing in Deir al-Zour, which enabled him to take over the leadership of his father, Aboud Hassan. Al-Hassan worked in trade and had extensive commercial relations with &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20peoples\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; merchants and &lt;a href=\"Aleppo\"&gt;Halbians&lt;/a&gt; and with his cousins Najjar and Tayfur in the city of &lt;a href=\"Hama\"&gt;Hama&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the trouble broke out in the city of Deir al-Zour after the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottomans&lt;/a&gt; left on 6 November 1918, people began looting and stealing from each other across the area, so it was necessary to have a strong authority for protecting the city and its people, and that led Al-Hassan who was the mayor to form his first government in the city and asking all &lt;a href=\"tribal\"&gt;tribal&lt;/a&gt; leaders in the &lt;a href=\"villages\"&gt;villages&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding districts to support him and pledge allegiance to him. One of this government's priorities was maintaining the security and running the affairs of the city. This government knew as the \"government of Haj Fadel.\"\nThe government continued until the arrival of Sharif Nasser, the cousin of Prince &lt;a href=\"Faisal%20bin%20Hussein\"&gt;Faisal Bin Al-Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, on 1 December 1918, and Mari Basha Al-Mallah on 7 December 1918.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Maysalun\"&gt;Battle of Maysalun&lt;/a&gt; on 24 July 1920 and occupation of &lt;a href=\"Damascus\"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"French%20Mandate%20for%20Syria%20and%20the%20Lebanon\"&gt;French forces&lt;/a&gt;, The city of &lt;a href=\"Deir%20Ezzor\"&gt;Deir Ezzor&lt;/a&gt; was in a state of chaos and insecurity, which prompted Al-Hassan to form his second government, Which has done excellent services in protecting the city and maintaining the security of its people despite its limited capabilities.\nThis government continued its work until 23 November 1920, when it was dissolved by the &lt;a href=\"French%20Mandate%20for%20Syria%20and%20the%20Lebanon\"&gt;French occupation&lt;/a&gt; authorities.\nAl-Hassan represented the &lt;a href=\"Euphrates\"&gt;Euphrates&lt;/a&gt; region at the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Syrian National Congress&lt;/a&gt; held in late June 1919, which proclaimed the independence of &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Syria\"&gt;Syrian Arab Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; on 8 March 1920, and appointed &lt;a href=\"Faisal%20bin%20Hussein\"&gt;Faisal bin Sharif Hussein&lt;/a&gt; as a king. Al-Hassan participated in the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Faisal%20bin%20Hussein\"&gt;Faisal&lt;/a&gt; as king of &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on 23 August 1921 and supported his &lt;a href=\"inauguration\"&gt;inauguration&lt;/a&gt;.\nAl-Hassan died in 1936 in Deir al-Zour and was buried there. His sons continued his political work. His son, Dr. Badri Fadel Aboud, became the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Health\"&gt;Minister of Health&lt;/a&gt; in the government of &lt;a href=\"Said%20al-Ghazzi\"&gt;Said Al-Ghazi&lt;/a&gt; in 1955, under the presidency of President &lt;a href=\"Shukri%20al-Quwatli\"&gt;Shukri al-Quwatli&lt;/a&gt;. He was the first &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Health\"&gt;Minister of Health&lt;/a&gt; from Deir al-Zour.\nAyyash Al-Haj.\nAyyash Al-Haj Hussein Al-Jassim, a &lt;a href=\"Syrian\"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; leader from Deir al-Zour city, began the armed struggle against the &lt;a href=\"French%20colonization\"&gt;French colonizer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"governorate\"&gt;governorate&lt;/a&gt; of Deir al-Zour in 1925 coinciding with the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Syrian%20Revolution\"&gt;Great Syrian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jabal%20al-Arab\"&gt;Jabal al-Arab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ghouta\"&gt;Ghouta&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Damascus\"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;.

When the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottomans&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Deir%20ez-Zor\"&gt;Deir ez-Zor&lt;/a&gt;, Ayyash Al-Haj contributed to protecting the people of &lt;a href=\"Deir%20ez-Zor\"&gt;Deir ez-Zor&lt;/a&gt; from the chaos and the absence of security left by the absence of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; authority.
