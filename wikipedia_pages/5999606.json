A crowd of 5,400 attended a &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt; quarter-final tie against &lt;a href=\"Shotts%20Bon%20Accord%20F.C.\"&gt;Shotts Bon Accord&lt;/a&gt; here during Glenrothes' run to the final in 1968. \nThe club moved to the purpose built Warout Stadium in 1971, one of the larger grounds in junior football, with room for around 5,000 spectators, 730 of whom can be seated. The record attendance for this ground is 5,600 against &lt;a href=\"Cambuslang%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Cambuslang Rangers&lt;/a&gt; in another Junior Cup quarter-final tie in 1974. \nGlenrothes' greatest success as a club came in 1975 when they won the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt;, defeating &lt;a href=\"Rutherglen%20Glencairn%20F.C.\"&gt;Rutherglen Glencairn&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130, in front of a crowd of 17,776 at &lt;a href=\"Hampden%20Park\"&gt;Hampden Park&lt;/a&gt;.
