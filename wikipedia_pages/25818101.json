    "text": "Richard Henry Wadge (1864\u20131923) was an English &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; manager who managed &lt;a href=\"Burnley%20F.C.\"&gt;Burnley&lt;/a&gt; for a short spell in 1910. Born in &lt;a href=\"Liskeard\"&gt;Liskeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cornwall\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;, he initially joined Burnley as a &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20directors\"&gt;director&lt;/a&gt; before taking charge of the first team for three matches following the death of former manager &lt;a href=\"Spen%20Whittaker\"&gt;Spen Whittaker&lt;/a&gt;. His first match in charge was the 0\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Glossop%20North%20End%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Glossop&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Turf%20Moor\"&gt;Turf Moor&lt;/a&gt; on 18 April 1910. Five days later, the team drew 1\u20131 with &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20Fosse%20F.C.\"&gt;Leicester Fosse&lt;/a&gt; and his final match in charge was the 3\u20130 victory at home to &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Lincoln City&lt;/a&gt; on 30 April 1910, which was the final match of the 1909\u201310 season. He subsequently returned to his role as a director and was replaced as manager by &lt;a href=\"John%20Haworth\"&gt;John Haworth&lt;/a&gt; prior to the start of the 1910\u201311 campaign. Wadge died in London in 1923, at the age of 59."
