    "text": "Milton Mignot Jordan (May 24, 1927 \u2013 May 13, 1993) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; player, a , right-handed &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; who appeared in eight &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Tigers\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt;. He was born in &lt;a href=\"Clearfield%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Mineral Springs, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, and served in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces\"&gt;United States Army Air Forces&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nJordan's nine-season (1948\u20131956) career was spent entirely in the Tiger organization. His Major League trial came at the outset of the &lt;a href=\"1953%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season\"&gt;1953 campaign&lt;/a&gt;. After two scoreless appearances as a &lt;a href=\"relief%20pitcher\"&gt;relief pitcher&lt;/a&gt;, Jordan was given his only MLB &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; assignment by &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Hutchinson\"&gt;Fred Hutchinson&lt;/a&gt; on April 22 against the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Briggs%20Stadium\"&gt;Briggs Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. In the second inning he surrendered three &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; but went on to last seven full innings, giving up six runs, all &lt;a href=\"earned%20run\"&gt;earned&lt;/a&gt; and 12 &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"home%20runs\"&gt;home runs&lt;/a&gt; by Chicago's &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Mele\"&gt;Sam Mele&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sherm%20Lollar\"&gt;Sherm Lollar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vern%20Stephens\"&gt;Vern Stephens&lt;/a&gt;. He departed with the Tigers trailing 6\u20131, and absorbed the loss in an eventual 9\u20137 defeat. It was his only Major League &lt;a href=\"decision%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt;. In 17 innings, he allowed 26 hits, 11 earned runs and five &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt;, with four &lt;a href=\"strikeouts\"&gt;strikeouts&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1953, Jordan won 12, lost only once, and compiled a 3.11 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; for the Triple-A &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Bisons\"&gt;Buffalo Bisons&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"International%20League\"&gt;International League&lt;/a&gt;, mostly working as a relief pitcher."
