    "text": "Cunda Kamm\u0101raputta was a &lt;a href=\"Metalsmith\"&gt;smith&lt;/a&gt; who gave &lt;a href=\"Gautama%20Buddha\"&gt;Gautama Buddha&lt;/a&gt; his last meal as an offering while he visited his mango grove in &lt;a href=\"Pava\"&gt;P\u0101v\u0101&lt;/a&gt; on his way to &lt;a href=\"Kushinagar\"&gt;Ku\u015b\u012bnagara&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after having Cunda's meal, the Buddha suffered from fatal &lt;a href=\"dysentery\"&gt;dysentery&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore entering the &lt;a href=\"parinirv%C4%81%E1%B9%87a\"&gt;parinirv\u0101\u1e47a&lt;/a&gt;, the Buddha told &lt;a href=\"%C4%80nanda\"&gt;\u0100nanda&lt;/a&gt; to visit Cunda and tell him that his meal had nothing to do with his getting ill, and therefore should feel no blame nor remorse; on the contrary, offering the Tath\u0101gata his last meal before passing away was of equal gain as of offering him his first meal before attaining &lt;a href=\"buddhahood\"&gt;buddhahood&lt;/a&gt;, and thus he should feel rejoice.\nName.\nThe name Kamm\u0101raputta (in &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt;, \"Karm\u0101raputra\") means \"son of the smith\". In Chinese, his name is rendered as \u6e96\u9640 (Zh\u01d4ntu\u00f3).\nCunda as a lay follower of Gautama Buddha.\nIn the \"Cunda Kamm\u0101raputta Sutta\", Gautama Buddha stays at Cunda's mango grove and they talk about rites of purification. Cunda declares that he approves of the rites of the &lt;a href=\"brahmin\"&gt;brahmin&lt;/a&gt;s of the West and the Buddha mentions that the rites of purification of these brahmins and the purification in the discipline of the noble ones is quite different. Cunda asks him to explain how there is purification in his discipline, and so the Buddha teaches him the ten courses of skillful action. Cunda praises him for his teachings and declares himself a lay follower from that day on.\nCunda's Meal.\nIn the \"Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101\u1e47a Sutta\", Gautama Buddha and a group of bhikkus stay at Cunda's mango grove and are offered by him a meal. The meal consists of sweet rice, cakes and \"s\u016bkaramaddava\", which is translated differently depending on the buddhist tradition. Since the word is composed by \"s\u016bkara\", which means \"pig\", and \"maddava\", which means \"soft, tender, delicate\", two alternatives are possible:\nIn the latter meaning, the term has been thought to refer to a mushroom or truffle, or a yam or tuber. The idea that the Buddha's last meal consisted of &lt;a href=\"pork\"&gt;pork&lt;/a&gt; is generally supported by the &lt;a href=\"Theravada\"&gt;Theravada&lt;/a&gt; tradition; while that it was a &lt;a href=\"Vegetarian%20cuisine\"&gt;vegetarian dish&lt;/a&gt;, by the &lt;a href=\"Mahayana\"&gt;Mahayana&lt;/a&gt; tradition. These may reflect the different traditional views on &lt;a href=\"Buddhist%20vegetarianism\"&gt;Buddhist vegetarianism&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vinaya\"&gt;monastic precepts&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the sutta, the Buddha asks Cunda to serve the rice and cakes to the community of bhikkus, and to only serve the \"s\u016bkaramaddava\" to him. Any leftovers should be buried in a pit. Cunda does as he is told."
