    "text": "Senecio cambrensis (Welsh groundsel or Welsh ragwort) is a &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; of the family &lt;a href=\"Asteraceae\"&gt;Asteraceae&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href=\"endemic%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; and currently known only from &lt;a href=\"North%20Wales\"&gt;North Wales&lt;/a&gt;. It is a recently evolved plant that arose suddenly as a result of &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28biology%29\"&gt;hybridization&lt;/a&gt; between two related species.\nOrigin.\nWelsh groundsel is an &lt;a href=\"allopolyploid\"&gt;allopolyploid&lt;/a&gt;, a plant that contains sets of &lt;a href=\"chromosome\"&gt;chromosome&lt;/a&gt;s originating from two different species. Its ancestor was \"&lt;a href=\"Senecio%20%C3%97%20baxteri\"&gt;Senecio \u00d7 baxteri&lt;/a&gt;\", an infertile hybrid that can arise spontaneously when the closely related groundsel (\"&lt;a href=\"Senecio%20vulgaris\"&gt;Senecio vulgaris&lt;/a&gt;\") and Oxford ragwort (\"&lt;a href=\"Senecio%20squalidus\"&gt;Senecio squalidus&lt;/a&gt;\") grow alongside each other. Sometime in the early 20th century, an accidental doubling of the number of chromosomes in an \"S. \u00d7 baxteri\" plant led to the formation of a new fertile species, Welsh groundsel.\nDistribution and habitat.\nIt was first discovered in 1948 by Horace E. Green at &lt;a href=\"Ffrith\"&gt;Ffrith&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Flintshire\"&gt;Flintshire&lt;/a&gt;, north-east &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. The species was described in 1955 by Effie M. Rosser of &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Museum\"&gt;Manchester Museum&lt;/a&gt; using material from the site. It was later found at a number of sites across the north-east of Wales including &lt;a href=\"Chirk\"&gt;Chirk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brymbo\"&gt;Brymbo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queensferry%2C%20Flintshire\"&gt;Queensferry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colwyn%20Bay\"&gt;Colwyn Bay&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"herbarium\"&gt;herbarium&lt;/a&gt; specimen was discovered that had been collected at &lt;a href=\"Brynteg%2C%20Wrexham\"&gt;Brynteg&lt;/a&gt; in 1925.\nIn &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; it was reported from &lt;a href=\"Shropshire\"&gt;Shropshire&lt;/a&gt; and an introduced population appeared in &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton\"&gt;Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt;. The Shropshire record is now thought to be erroneous and the Wolverhampton plants have disappeared. There are no recent records from England.\nIn 1982, Welsh groundsel was discovered at several sites around &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. Another case of dual evolutionary locations is \"&lt;a href=\"Erythranthe%20peregrina\"&gt;Erythranthe peregrina&lt;/a&gt;\", which arose in two separate parts of Scotland. This population arose independently from the Welsh population; it is believed to date from at least 1974 but now appears to have disappeared with no records since 1993.\nTypical habitats of the species include waste ground, roadsides and cracks in walls and pavements.\nDescription.\nThe plant is intermediate in appearance between its parents, groundsel and Oxford ragwort. It is an erect &lt;a href=\"annual%20plant\"&gt;annual plant&lt;/a&gt; that reaches a height of 30 (sometimes 50) centimetres. The stem and leaves have few or no hairs. The leaves are deeply lobed. The lower leaves have stalks, whereas the upper leaves are attached directly to the stem. The &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28botany%29\"&gt;flower heads&lt;/a&gt; are cylindrical and usually have 8 to 15 yellow &lt;a href=\"ray%20floret\"&gt;ray floret&lt;/a&gt;s (\"petals\") although some are rayless. The ray florets vary in length but are most commonly 4 to 7\u00a0mm long. The &lt;a href=\"pollen\"&gt;pollen&lt;/a&gt; grains are 30 to 36 &lt;a href=\"micrometre\"&gt;micrometre&lt;/a&gt;s across and usually have 4 pores."
