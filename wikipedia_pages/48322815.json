    "text": "Chelonoidis donfaustoi, known as the eastern Santa Cruz tortoise, is a &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gal%C3%A1pagos%20tortoise\"&gt;Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise&lt;/a&gt; living on &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Cruz%20Island%20%28Gal%C3%A1pagos%29\"&gt;Santa Cruz Island&lt;/a&gt;, within the &lt;a href=\"Gal%C3%A1pagos\"&gt;Gal\u00e1pagos&lt;/a&gt;. Until 2015, \"C. donfaustoi\" was classified as part of another species, \"&lt;a href=\"Gal%C3%A1pagos%20tortoise%23Evolutionary%20history\"&gt;Chelonoidis porteri&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTortoise populations on Santa Cruz Island.\nEarlier &lt;a href=\"mitochondrial%20DNA\"&gt;mitochondrial DNA&lt;/a&gt; studies of tortoises on Santa Cruz showed up to three genetically distinct lineages found in nonoverlapping population distributions around the regions of Cerro Monturra in the northwest, Cerro Fatal in the east, and La Reserva (or La Caseta) in the southwest. Although traditionally classified together, the lineages were all shown to be more closely related to tortoises on other islands than to each other, and thus are thought to be the result of three separate &lt;a href=\"Colonisation%20%28biology%29\"&gt;colonizations&lt;/a&gt; of the island. Cerro Monturra tortoises are most closely related to \"duncanensis\" tortoises from &lt;a href=\"Pinz%C3%B3n%20Island\"&gt;Pinz\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, Cerro Fatal to \"chathamensis\" from &lt;a href=\"San%20Crist%C3%B3bal%20Island\"&gt;San Crist\u00f3bal&lt;/a&gt;, while Reserva tortoises are closer to the four southern races of &lt;a href=\"Isabela%20Island%20%28Gal%C3%A1pagos%29\"&gt;Isabela&lt;/a&gt;. Tortoises are aided in &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20dispersal\"&gt;oceanic dispersal&lt;/a&gt; by their ability to float with their heads up, and to survive up to six months without food or water.\nClassification.\nIn 2015, \"Chelonoidis donfaustoi\" was reclassified as a new species on the basis of genetic and morphological data. \"C. donfaustoi\" is the &lt;a href=\"sister%20lineage\"&gt;sister lineage&lt;/a&gt; to \"C. chathamensis\" on San Crist\u00f3bal, and is part of a &lt;a href=\"clade\"&gt;clade&lt;/a&gt; that also includes \"C. hoodensis\" of &lt;a href=\"Espa%C3%B1ola%20Island\"&gt;Espa\u00f1ola&lt;/a&gt; and \"C. abingdoni\" of &lt;a href=\"Pinta%20Island\"&gt;Pinta&lt;/a&gt;. Genetically, \"C. donfaustoi\" differs from other tortoises by &lt;a href=\"allele\"&gt;allele&lt;/a&gt; frequency at 12 &lt;a href=\"microsatellite\"&gt;microsatellite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Locus%20%28genetics%29\"&gt;loci&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed assignment to the genetically distinct cluster. \"C. donfaustoi\" also shares a set of &lt;a href=\"nucleotide\"&gt;nucleotide&lt;/a&gt;s distinct from that of \"C. porteri\" on the same Santa Cruz Island and from \"C. chathamensis\".\nThe reclassification reduced the &lt;a href=\"Range%20%28biology%29\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt; of \"C. porteri\" to the western and southwestern parts of Santa Cruz Island. At the same time it confined \"C. donfaustoi\" to the eastern part of Santa Cruz Island, with a population size estimated at 250 individuals. \"C. porteri\" was shown to be part of a clade that includes the &lt;a href=\"Floreana%20Island\"&gt;Floreana&lt;/a&gt; and southern Isabela tortoises, as well as specimens reputedly representing &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A1bida%20Island\"&gt;R\u00e1bida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fernandina%20Island\"&gt;Fernandina&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe species received the &lt;a href=\"Binomial%20nomenclature\"&gt;scientific epithet&lt;/a&gt; \"donfaustoi\" in honor of Fausto Llerena S\u00e1nchez, who devoted 43 years to giant tortoise conservation as a park ranger within the Galapagos National Park Directorate. \u201cDon Fausto\u201d was the primary caretaker of endangered tortoises in captivity.\n\"C. donfaustoi\" is the 15th known tortoise species to be discovered on the islands, with four of those species being extinct. The classification of a new tortoise species was the first in over a century.\nAppearance.\nWhile similar to other Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises, \"C. donfaustoi\" can be distinguished from them by means of &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20shell\"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt; size and shape. Some Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises are larger than \"C. donfaustoi\", with higher anterior opening of the shell."
