    "text": "Knoydart (&lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Gaelic\"&gt;Scottish Gaelic&lt;/a&gt;: \"Cn\u00f2ideart\") is a &lt;a href=\"peninsula\"&gt;peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lochaber\"&gt;Lochaber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Highland%20%28council%20area%29\"&gt;Highland&lt;/a&gt;, on the west coast of &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. Knoydart is sandwiched between Lochs &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Nevis\"&gt;Nevis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Hourn\"&gt;Hourn&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 often translated as \"Loch Heaven\" (from the Gaelic \"Loch N\u00e9imh\") and \"Loch Hell\" (Gaelic: \"Loch Iutharn\") respectively, although the somewhat poetic nature of these derivations is disputed. Forming the northern part of what is traditionally known as \"na Garbh-Chr\u00ecochan\" or \"the &lt;a href=\"The%20Rough%20Bounds\"&gt;Rough Bounds&lt;/a&gt;\", because of its harsh terrain and remoteness, Knoydart is also referred to as \"Britain's last wilderness\". It is only accessible by boat, or by a 16-mile (26\u00a0km) walk through rough country, and the seven miles (11\u00a0km) of tarred road are not connected to the UK road system.\nKnoydart is designated as one of the forty &lt;a href=\"National%20scenic%20area%20%28Scotland%29\"&gt;national scenic areas&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers in total, of which is on land, with a further being marine (i.e. below &lt;a href=\"Mean%20low%20water%20spring\"&gt;low tide level&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe area is popular with hill walkers, mountaineers, sailors and wildlife enthusiasts. It includes the &lt;a href=\"Munro\"&gt;Munro&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Ladhar%20Bheinn\"&gt;Ladhar Bheinn&lt;/a&gt; (1020\u00a0m), &lt;a href=\"Luinne%20Bheinn\"&gt;Luinne Bheinn&lt;/a&gt; (939\u00a0m), &lt;a href=\"Meall%20Buidhe%2C%20Knoydart\"&gt;Meall Buidhe&lt;/a&gt; (946\u00a0m) and &lt;a href=\"Sgurr%20na%20C%C3%ACche\"&gt;Sgurr na C\u00ecche&lt;/a&gt; (1040\u00a0m). The peninsula also contains six &lt;a href=\"Lists%20of%20mountains%20and%20hills%20in%20the%20British%20Isles%23Corbetts\"&gt;Corbetts&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Aden\"&gt;Ben Aden&lt;/a&gt; (887\u00a0m) and &lt;a href=\"Beinn%20na%20Caillich%20%28Knoydart%29\"&gt;Beinn na Caillich&lt;/a&gt; (785\u00a0m).\nHistory.\nKnoydart formed part of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Somerled\"&gt;Somerled&lt;/a&gt; (died 1164), before passing to the &lt;a href=\"Clann%20Ruaidhr%C3%AD\"&gt;Clann Ruaidhr\u00ed&lt;/a&gt; branch of his descendants \u2013 the eventual heiress of whom married &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Islay\"&gt;John of Islay&lt;/a&gt; (died circa 1386). Members of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Donald\"&gt;Clan Donald&lt;/a&gt; held Knoydart from the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century is generally believed to have descended from Allan Macdonald, 2nd of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Macdonald%20of%20Clanranald\"&gt;Clanranald&lt;/a&gt; (died circa 1429). However, in the early 17th century, &lt;a href=\"Clan%20MacDonell%20of%20Glengarry\"&gt;Macdonell of Glengarry&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in wresting control of Knoydart from Clanranald, receiving official confirmation of his ownership from the &lt;a href=\"James%20VI%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; in 1613. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"1745%20Jacobite%20rising\"&gt;1745 Jacobite rising&lt;/a&gt; the population numbered nearly a thousand. There was much emigration, mainly to Canada (&lt;a href=\"Knoydart%2C%20Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Knoydart, Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; is named after the community). Despite this emigration, the population remained at nearly a thousand in 1841.\nIn 1852 four hundred of the inhabitants were given notice of eviction for the following year and offered passages overseas, originally to Australia, but later their destination was changed to Canada. On 9 August 1853 three hundred and thirty inhabitants from the west coast of the peninsula went on board the \"Sillery\" and left for Canada. However, 11 families comprising over 60 people refused to go and the story of their eviction became notorious as part of the &lt;a href=\"Highland%20clearances\"&gt;Highland Clearances&lt;/a&gt;. Knoydart was finally sold by the MacDonell family in 1856, passing into the hands of an Ayrshire ironmaster, &lt;a href=\"James%20Baird%20%28industrialist%29\"&gt;James Baird of Cambusdoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1948, an unsuccessful &lt;a href=\"land%20raid\"&gt;land raid&lt;/a&gt; was undertaken by the \"&lt;a href=\"Seven%20Men%20of%20Knoydart\"&gt;Seven Men of Knoydart&lt;/a&gt;\", who attempted to claim land in the ownership of the estate for their own use. Their claims were contested by the estate owner, the &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Nall-Cain%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Brocket\"&gt;Second Baron Brocket&lt;/a&gt;, who took the case to the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Session\"&gt;Court of Session&lt;/a&gt; which ruled against the land-raiders. An appeal to the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Scotland\"&gt;Secretary of State for Scotland&lt;/a&gt; was rejected and the Seven Men gave up their fight to obtain crofts on Knoydart. A cairn commemorating their land raid was unveiled at Inverie in 1981.\nModern ownership.\nThe Knoydart Foundation was established in 1997 to take ownership of the Knoydart Estate which makes up much of the peninsula, including the village of Inverie. The Foundation, which is a &lt;a href=\"Charitable%20organization\"&gt;registered charity&lt;/a&gt; under Scottish law, bought the estate in 1999. It is a partnership of local residents, the &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Council\"&gt;Highland Council&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Brasher\"&gt;Chris Brasher&lt;/a&gt; Trust, and the &lt;a href=\"John%20Muir%20Trust\"&gt;John Muir Trust&lt;/a&gt;. The foundation aim is to \"manage the Knoydart Estate as an area of employment and settlement on the Knoydart Peninsula without detriment to its natural beauty and character and to seek and encourage the preservation of its landscape, wildlife, natural resources, culture and rural heritage.\"\nThe neighbouring privately owned Kilchoan Estate was part of the foundation when it was set up, but have since resigned their directorship. Kilchoan Estate covers of the peninsula, and lies to the east of the Knoydart Foundation land. Other landholdings on Knoydart include the Camusrory Estate (lying to the east of the Kilchoan Estate), and the Barisdale Estate on the northern side of the peninsula, which extends as far east as &lt;a href=\"Kinloch%20Hourn\"&gt;Kinloch Hourn&lt;/a&gt;. of land on the northern slopes of &lt;a href=\"Ladhar%20Bheinn\"&gt;Ladhar Bheinn&lt;/a&gt; is owned by the &lt;a href=\"John%20Muir%20Trust\"&gt;John Muir Trust&lt;/a&gt;, one of the participants in the Knoydart Foundation.\nInfrastructure.\n&lt;a href=\"Inverie\"&gt;Inverie&lt;/a&gt; is the main settlement on the peninsula, which has a resident population of 98 adults. There is a post office, a primary school, a brewery and a variety of accommodation for visitors, including &lt;a href=\"Bed%20and%20breakfast\"&gt;B&amp;B&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bunkhouse\"&gt;bunkhouse&lt;/a&gt;s and self-catering accommodation. The Old Forge Inn, Knoydart's only &lt;a href=\"pub\"&gt;pub&lt;/a&gt;, is the most remote public house in mainland Britain.\nA vehicle track runs from Inverie to the smaller settlement of Airor, on the west side of the peninsula, a little over . On its way to Airor, the track passes the settlements of Scottas, Sandaig and Doune. The track is a designated public highway and is maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Council\"&gt;Highland Council&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 however in common with the &lt;a href=\"Small%20Isles\"&gt;Small Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a resident or visitors permit is required to drive on the road.\nThe Highland Council-subsidised ferry is operated from Mallaig to Inverie by Western Isles Cruises, previously known as Bruce Watt Cruises. For a period of three years Knoydart Sea Bridge had the council contract; this reverted to Western Isles Cruises on 1 April 2016. Various passenger and equipment services are offered by private boat operators.\nThe Foundation operates a &lt;a href=\"hydro-electric\"&gt;hydro-electric&lt;/a&gt; scheme which provides power to Inverie as the area is entirely off the &lt;a href=\"National%20Grid%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;national grid&lt;/a&gt;. The scheme is almost entirely dependent on unpaid volunteers and the current pipeline will need replacing in the near future. As a result, the Knoydart community's current focus is coming up with a solution to ensure a continued power supply and ultimately that living on Knoydart remains viable.\nIn May 2005 the &lt;a href=\"Highlands%20and%20Islands%20Community%20Energy%20Company\"&gt;Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company&lt;/a&gt; hosted its first conference in Inverie, during which the company was officially launched. A new pier at Inverie was officially opened on 24 August 2006 by &lt;a href=\"Tavish%20Scott\"&gt;Tavish Scott&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Parliament\"&gt;MSP&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019 the Knoydart Foundation are celebrating 20 years of community ownership. They are fundraising for and undertaking extensive renovations to Knoydart Community Hall, which provides an essential meeting space and venue for visiting bands and musicians, sports and activities, community events, school, Foundation and Ranger events, activities and meetings, and parties and weddings.\nNatural environment.\nThe underlying geology of Knoydart consists mainly of &lt;a href=\"mica-schist\"&gt;mica-schist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"quartz\"&gt;quartz&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"feldspar\"&gt;feldspar&lt;/a&gt; of the type associated with the &lt;a href=\"Moine%20thrust\"&gt;Moine thrust&lt;/a&gt;, along with some areas of &lt;a href=\"Lewisian%20gneiss\"&gt;Lewisian gneiss&lt;/a&gt; around Loch Hourn. The landscape shows many signs of &lt;a href=\"glaciation\"&gt;glaciation&lt;/a&gt;, with deep &lt;a href=\"fjord\"&gt;fjord&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"sea%20loch\"&gt;sea loch&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hanging%20valley\"&gt;hanging valley&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cirque\"&gt;corries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ar%C3%AAte\"&gt;ar\u00eate&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"moraines\"&gt;moraines&lt;/a&gt;. The rebound effect that followed the melting of the glaciers at the end of the &lt;a href=\"ice%20age\"&gt;ice age&lt;/a&gt; has led to the formation of &lt;a href=\"raised%20beach\"&gt;raised beach&lt;/a&gt;es.\n&lt;a href=\"Birch\"&gt;Birch&lt;/a&gt;woods grow on the steep slopes of the glens and above the shoreline, and there are some areas of &lt;a href=\"Caledonian%20Forest\"&gt;Caledonian pinewood&lt;/a&gt;s around Barrisdale. In common with much of the highlands, historic overgrazing, first by sheep and latterly by deer (predominantly &lt;a href=\"red%20deer\"&gt;red deer&lt;/a&gt;), has led to a reduction in the amount of forested land. The deer population is therefore managed by culling in order to allow existing native woodland to regenerate over the long term. The estates on the western part of the peninsula cooperate in this aim via the West Knoydart Deer Management Group, whilst the more easterly estates form the Knoydart Deer Management Group, whose area takes in much of &lt;a href=\"The%20Rough%20Bounds\"&gt;The Rough Bounds&lt;/a&gt; of Knoydart. There was controversy in 2015 following culling on the &lt;a href=\"John%20Muir%20Trust\"&gt;John Muir Trust&lt;/a&gt; land in the north of Knoydart, which resulted in some deer carcasses being left on the open hillside rather than being extracted for use as &lt;a href=\"venison\"&gt;venison&lt;/a&gt;.\nWildlife in the area includes &lt;a href=\"badger\"&gt;badger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pine%20marten\"&gt;pine marten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"european%20otter\"&gt;otters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20deer\"&gt;red deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"buzzard\"&gt;buzzard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"golden%20eagle\"&gt;golden eagle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sea%20eagle\"&gt;sea eagle&lt;/a&gt;s; there are also two small herds of &lt;a href=\"feral%20goat\"&gt;feral goat&lt;/a&gt;s. There is a &lt;a href=\"Bird%20hide\"&gt;wildlife hide&lt;/a&gt; on the beach near Inverie. The seas to the west of Knoydart are designated as a &lt;a href=\"Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation\"&gt;Special Area of Conservation&lt;/a&gt; due their importance for &lt;a href=\"harbour%20porpoise\"&gt;harbour porpoise&lt;/a&gt;s."
