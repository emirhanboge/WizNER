Continuing to act in Australia, he rose to prominence with his appearances in the films &lt;a href=\"Proof%20%281991%20film%29\"&gt;\"Proof\"&lt;/a&gt; (1991) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adventures%20of%20Priscilla%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Desert\"&gt;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&lt;/a&gt;\" (1994), winning his first AACTA Award for &lt;a href=\"AACTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role\"&gt;Best Actor in a Leading Role&lt;/a&gt; for the former. By the turn of the millennium, Weaving achieved international recognition through appearances in mainstream American productions. His most notable film roles include &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Smith\"&gt;Agent Smith&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Matrix%20%28franchise%29\"&gt;first three \"The Matrix\" films&lt;/a&gt; (1999\u20132003), &lt;a href=\"Elrond\"&gt;Elrond&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%28film%20series%29\"&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/a&gt;\" (2001\u20132003) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hobbit%20%28film%20series%29\"&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/a&gt;\" (2012\u20132014) trilogies, the &lt;a href=\"V%20%28character%29\"&gt;title character&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"V%20for%20Vendetta%20%28film%29\"&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/a&gt;\" (2005), and &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Schmidt%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29\"&gt;Johann Schmidt / Red Skull&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe\"&gt;Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/a&gt; (MCU) film \"\" (2011).\nIn addition to his live action appearances, Weaving has had several &lt;a href=\"voice%20acting\"&gt;voice over&lt;/a&gt; roles, including in the films \"&lt;a href=\"Babe%20%28film%29\"&gt;Babe&lt;/a&gt;\" (1995), \"&lt;a href=\"Happy%20Feet\"&gt;Happy Feet&lt;/a&gt;\" (2006) and \"&lt;a href=\"Happy%20Feet%20Two\"&gt;Happy Feet Two&lt;/a&gt;\" (2011), and the &lt;a href=\"Transformers%20%28film%20series%29\"&gt;\"Transformers\"&lt;/a&gt; series as &lt;a href=\"Megatron\"&gt;Megatron&lt;/a&gt;. He also reprised his roles of Agent Smith and Elrond in \"Matrix\" and \"Lord of the Rings\" video game adaptations.\nEarly life.\nWeaving was born on 4 April 1960 at the &lt;a href=\"University%20College%20Hospital%2C%20Ibadan\"&gt;University of Ibadan Teaching Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Ibadan\"&gt;Ibadan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; to English parents; he is the son of Anne Lennard (born 1934), a tour guide and former teacher, and Wallace Weaving (born 1929), a &lt;a href=\"seismologist\"&gt;seismologist&lt;/a&gt;, who met as students at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Bristol\"&gt;University of Bristol&lt;/a&gt;. His maternal grandmother was Belgian. A year after his birth, his family returned to the United Kingdom, living in &lt;a href=\"Bedford\"&gt;Bedford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brighton\"&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt; before moving to &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; in Australia; &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg\"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa; and then returning to the United Kingdom again. While in the UK, he attended &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20House%2C%20Wraxall\"&gt;The Downs School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wraxall%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Wraxall&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%27s%20Hospital\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. While at the Downs School, in 1973 Weaving played one of his first theatrical roles, taking the part of Captain Asquith in &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Bolt\"&gt;Robert Bolt&lt;/a&gt;'s \"The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew\". His family moved back to Australia in 1976, where he attended &lt;a href=\"Knox%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;Knox Grammar School&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney. He graduated from Sydney's &lt;a href=\"National%20Institute%20of%20Dramatic%20Art\"&gt;National Institute of Dramatic Art&lt;/a&gt; in 1981.\nCareer.\n1984\u20131998.\nWeaving's first television role was in the 1984 Australian television series \"&lt;a href=\"Bodyline%20%28miniseries%29\"&gt;Bodyline&lt;/a&gt;\", as the &lt;a href=\"England%20cricket%20team\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; cricket captain &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Jardine\"&gt;Douglas Jardine&lt;/a&gt;. Weaving appeared in the Australian miniseries \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dirtwater%20Dynasty\"&gt;The Dirtwater Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1988 and as &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20Chambers\"&gt;Geoffrey Chambers&lt;/a&gt; in the drama \"&lt;a href=\"Dadah%20is%20Death\"&gt;Barlow and Chambers: A Long Way From Home&lt;/a&gt;\". He starred opposite &lt;a href=\"Nicole%20Kidman\"&gt;Nicole Kidman&lt;/a&gt; in the 1989 TV mini-series \"&lt;a href=\"Bangkok%20Hilton\"&gt;Bangkok Hilton&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1991, Weaving received the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Film%20Institute\"&gt;Australian Film Institute&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Best Actor\" award for his performance in the low-budget \"&lt;a href=\"Proof%20%281991%20film%29\"&gt;Proof&lt;/a&gt;\" as the blind photographer. He appeared as Sir John in &lt;a href=\"Yahoo%20Serious\"&gt;Yahoo Serious&lt;/a&gt;'s 1993 comedy \"&lt;a href=\"Reckless%20Kelly\"&gt;Reckless Kelly&lt;/a&gt;\", a lampoon of Australian outlaw &lt;a href=\"Ned%20Kelly\"&gt;Ned Kelly&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the mid-1990s, Weaving portrayed &lt;a href=\"drag%20queen\"&gt;drag queen&lt;/a&gt; Anthony \"Tick\" Belrose/Mitzi Del Bra in the 1994 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adventures%20of%20Priscilla%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Desert\"&gt;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&lt;/a&gt;\", and provided the voice of Rex the sheepdog in the 1995 family film \"&lt;a href=\"Babe%20%28film%29\"&gt;Babe&lt;/a&gt;\" and its 1998 sequel \"\". In 1998, he received the \"Best Actor\" award from the &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Montreal Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; for his performance as a suspected &lt;a href=\"serial%20killer\"&gt;serial killer&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Interview%20%281998%20film%29\"&gt;The Interview&lt;/a&gt;\".\n1999\u20132010.\nWeaving played the enigmatic and evil-minded &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Smith\"&gt;Agent Smith&lt;/a&gt; in the 1999 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Matrix\"&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;\". He later reprised that role in the film's 2003 sequels, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Matrix%20Reloaded\"&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Matrix%20Revolutions\"&gt;The Matrix Revolutions&lt;/a&gt;\". He was a voice actor in the cartoon film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Magic%20Pudding%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Magic Pudding&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe received additional acclaim in the role of half-elven lord &lt;a href=\"Elrond\"&gt;Elrond&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Jackson\"&gt;Peter Jackson&lt;/a&gt;'s three-film adaptation of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings\"&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/a&gt;\", released between 2001 and 2003. Weaving was the main actor in Andrew Kotatko's award-winning film \"&lt;a href=\"Everything%20Goes%20%28film%29\"&gt;Everything Goes&lt;/a&gt;\" (2004). He starred as a heroin-addicted ex-&lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; player in the 2005 Australian &lt;a href=\"indie%20film\"&gt;indie film&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Little%20Fish%20%282005%20film%29\"&gt;Little Fish&lt;/a&gt;\", opposite &lt;a href=\"Cate%20Blanchett\"&gt;Cate Blanchett&lt;/a&gt;. Weaving played the title role as &lt;a href=\"V%20%28comics%29\"&gt;V&lt;/a&gt; in the 2005 film \"&lt;a href=\"V%20for%20Vendetta%20%28film%29\"&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/a&gt;\", in which he was reunited with &lt;a href=\"the%20Wachowskis\"&gt;the Wachowskis&lt;/a&gt;, creators of \"The Matrix\" trilogy, who wrote the adapted screenplay. Actor &lt;a href=\"James%20Purefoy\"&gt;James Purefoy&lt;/a&gt; was originally signed to play the role, but was fired six weeks into filming over creative differences. Weaving reshot most of Purefoy's scenes as V (even though his face is never seen) apart from a couple of minor dialogue-free scenes early in the film while stuntman David Leitch performed all of V's stunts.\nWeaving reprised his role as Elrond for the video game \"\". He regularly appears in productions by the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Theatre%20Company\"&gt;Sydney Theatre Company&lt;/a&gt; (STC). In 2006, he worked with Cate Blanchett on a reprise of the STC production of \"&lt;a href=\"Hedda%20Gabler\"&gt;Hedda Gabler&lt;/a&gt;\" in New York City. In a controversial move by director &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Bay\"&gt;Michael Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Weaving was chosen as the &lt;a href=\"Decepticon\"&gt;Decepticon&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Megatron%20%28Transformers%29%23Transformers\"&gt;Megatron&lt;/a&gt; vocally in the 2007 live-action film \"&lt;a href=\"Transformers%20%28film%29\"&gt;Transformers&lt;/a&gt;\", rather than using the &lt;a href=\"Megatron%20%28Transformers%29\"&gt;original version of the character&lt;/a&gt;'s voice created by the voice actor &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Welker\"&gt;Frank Welker&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaving himself was unaware of the controversy and had accepted the role based on Michael Bay's personal request; in a November 2008 \"Sun Herald\" interview, he said he had never seen \"Transformers\". Though Weaving reprised his role in two sequels, he does not have much personal investment in the \"Transformers\" films. In February 2010, Weaving revealed to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Age\"&gt;The Age&lt;/a&gt;\": \"Director Michael Bay talks to me on the phone. I've never met him. We were doing the voice for the second one and I still hadn't seen the first one. I still didn't really know who the characters were and I didn't know what anything was. It's a voice job, for sure, and people assume I've spent my life working on it, but I really know so little about it.\" In 2012, Weaving said to \"&lt;a href=\"Collider%20%28website%29\"&gt;Collider&lt;/a&gt;\": \"It was one of the only things I've ever done where I had no knowledge of it, I didn't care about it, I didn't think about it. They wanted me to do it. In one way, I regret that bit. I don't regret doing it, but I very rarely do something if it's meaningless. It was meaningless to me, honestly. I don't mean that in any nasty way.\"\nWeaving played a supporting role in &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Johnston\"&gt;Joe Johnston&lt;/a&gt;'s 2010 remake of the 1941 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wolfman%20%282010%20film%29\"&gt;The Wolfman&lt;/a&gt;\", starring &lt;a href=\"Benicio%20del%20Toro\"&gt;Benicio del Toro&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately after \"Wolfman\" wrapped in spring 2008, he returned home to Australia to film a lead role in the film \"&lt;a href=\"Last%20Ride%20%28film%29\"&gt;Last Ride&lt;/a&gt;\", directed by Glendyn Ivin. In early 2009, &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20del%20Toro\"&gt;Guillermo del Toro&lt;/a&gt;, then director of &lt;a href=\"The%20Hobbit%20%28film%20series%29\"&gt;\"The Hobbit\" films&lt;/a&gt;, prequels to \"The Lord of the Rings\", confirmed his intent to again cast Weaving as &lt;a href=\"Elrond\"&gt;Elrond&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rivendell\"&gt;Rivendell&lt;/a&gt; in a BBC interview. When asked about reprising the role, Weaving replied that he was game, but had not officially been approached. Del Toro eventually left the project; Peter Jackson decided to direct the films himself but Weaving was not officially confirmed in the cast until May 2011.\nWeaving spent the summer of 2009 starring in the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Theatre%20Company\"&gt;Melbourne Theatre Company&lt;/a&gt;'s production of \"&lt;a href=\"God%20of%20Carnage\"&gt;God of Carnage&lt;/a&gt;\", portraying the caustic lawyer Alain Reille. He returned to the stage in November 2010 in Sydney Theatre Company's \"&lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vanya\"&gt;Uncle Vanya&lt;/a&gt;\", co-starring Cate Blanchett and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Roxburgh\"&gt;Richard Roxburgh&lt;/a&gt;. Weaving filmed a guest role on Roxburgh's Australian TV series \"&lt;a href=\"Rake%20%282010%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Rake&lt;/a&gt;\" in May 2010.\nIn May 2009, Weaving accepted a co-starring role in the docudrama \"&lt;a href=\"Oranges%20and%20Sunshine\"&gt;Oranges and Sunshine&lt;/a&gt;\", about the forced migration of thousands of British children to Australia in the 1950s. Filming began in autumn 2009 in &lt;a href=\"Nottingham\"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;, England, and &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;, South Australia, and continued through January 2010. The film premiered at the &lt;a href=\"Rome%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Rome International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; on 28 October 2010 and garnered positive reviews. 2010 also saw the release of \"\" (formerly \"The Guardians of Ga'Hoole\"), in which Weaving has another high-profile voice role, portraying two different owls named Noctus and Grimble in &lt;a href=\"Zack%20Snyder\"&gt;Zack Snyder&lt;/a&gt;'s film adaptation of &lt;a href=\"Kathryn%20Lasky\"&gt;Kathryn Lasky&lt;/a&gt;'s popular series of children's books.\nOn 4 May 2010, it was officially confirmed by &lt;a href=\"Marvel%20Studios\"&gt;Marvel Studios&lt;/a&gt; that Weaving would play the fictional &lt;a href=\"Nazi\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Red%20Skull\"&gt;Red Skull&lt;/a&gt; in the superhero film \"\". Weaving completed filming his role on the project in September 2010 and returned to Sydney to prepare for \"Uncle Vanya\". It is unlikely he will sign on for any further installments in the &lt;a href=\"Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe\"&gt;Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/a&gt;; in an August 2011 \"&lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Sun\"&gt;Baltimore Sun&lt;/a&gt;\" interview, the actor confided he is weary of typecasting and of \"blockbuster\" films in general: \"I think I've about had enough... I'm not sure how many more of them I'll make. It doesn't feel to me as though they've been the majority of my work, though that's probably the way it seems to most other people.\"\n2011\u2013present.\nOn 13 March 2011, \"The Key Man\", which Weaving filmed in 2006, finally debuted at the &lt;a href=\"South%20By%20Southwest\"&gt;South By Southwest&lt;/a&gt; Festival in &lt;a href=\"Austin%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The child migrant saga \"&lt;a href=\"Oranges%20and%20Sunshine\"&gt;Oranges and Sunshine&lt;/a&gt;\" opened in the UK on 1 April, the culmination of months of success on the festival circuit in late 2010-early 2011. In March, the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Theatre%20Company\"&gt;Sydney Theatre Company&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts\"&gt;John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts&lt;/a&gt; announced that STC's 2010 production of Chekhov's &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vanya\"&gt;Uncle Vanya&lt;/a&gt; would be reprised in Washington, D.C., during the month of August. In April, months of speculation finally ended when Weaving appeared on &lt;a href=\"The%20Hobbit%20%28film%20series%29\"&gt;\"The Hobbit\"&lt;/a&gt;'s New Zealand set, shortly before a production spokesman officially confirmed the actor's return as Elrond in Peter Jackson's prequel trilogy to \"The Lord of the Rings\". He was part of the cast of the Wachowskis' adaptation of &lt;a href=\"David%20Mitchell%20%28author%29\"&gt;David Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;'s novel \"&lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Atlas%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Cloud Atlas&lt;/a&gt;\". The project, co-starring &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Hanks\"&gt;Tom Hanks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Whishaw\"&gt;Ben Whishaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halle%20Berry\"&gt;Halle Berry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Broadbent\"&gt;Jim Broadbent&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Susan%20Sarandon\"&gt;Susan Sarandon&lt;/a&gt;, began filming in September 2011 and was released in October 2012.\n2012 also found Weaving re-focusing on his theatrical career, with a return to the Sydney Theatre Company to star in a new adaptation of &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Hampton\"&gt;Christopher Hampton&lt;/a&gt;'s play \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20Liaisons%20Dangereuses\"&gt;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&lt;/a&gt;\" in March. He portrayed the notorious Vicomte de Valmont, a character he first played onstage in 1987. His frequent stage foil &lt;a href=\"Pamela%20Rabe\"&gt;Pamela Rabe&lt;/a&gt; costarred. Weaving and &lt;a href=\"Cate%20Blanchett\"&gt;Cate Blanchett&lt;/a&gt; reprised their roles in STC's internationally lauded production of \"Uncle Vanya\" for a ten-day run at &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20Center\"&gt;Lincoln Center&lt;/a&gt; in July.\nThe busy actor also joined the cast of three forthcoming Australian films in summer 2012. The Western-tinged police thriller \"&lt;a href=\"Mystery%20Road%20%28film%29\"&gt;Mystery Road&lt;/a&gt;\", written and directed by &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Sen\"&gt;Ivan Sen&lt;/a&gt;, began filming in June 2012. Weaving appeared in the prison drama \"&lt;a href=\"Healing%20%28film%29\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt;\" for director Craig Monahan, with whom he previously made \"The Interview\" (1998) and \"Peaches\" (2005). He appeared in a segment of the Australian anthology film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Turning%20%282013%20film%29\"&gt;The Turning&lt;/a&gt;\", based on &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Winton\"&gt;Tim Winton&lt;/a&gt;'s collection of linked stories, entitled \"The Commission\", directed by &lt;a href=\"David%20Wenham\"&gt;David Wenham&lt;/a&gt;. He ended 2013 co-starring with &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Roxburgh\"&gt;Richard Roxburgh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Quast\"&gt;Philip Quast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Beckett\"&gt;Samuel Beckett&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Waiting%20For%20Godot\"&gt;Waiting For Godot&lt;/a&gt;\", for the Sydney Theatre Company.\nIn the spring of 2013, Weaving reprised the &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Smith\"&gt;Agent Smith&lt;/a&gt; role for a &lt;a href=\"General%20Electric\"&gt;General Electric&lt;/a&gt; television commercial for their \"Brilliant Machines\" innovations in healthcare management technology, which was slated to air during a break from 13 April's edition of \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20Live\"&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/a&gt;\", and subsequently continued to receive multiple airings on major cable networks.\nFrom 26 July to 27 September 2014, Weaving played the titular role of &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Theatre%20Company\"&gt;Sydney Theatre Company&lt;/a&gt;'s production of \"&lt;a href=\"Macbeth\"&gt;Macbeth&lt;/a&gt;\". In an unusual treatment of the Shakespearian tragedy by young Sydney director &lt;a href=\"Kip%20Williams\"&gt;Kip Williams&lt;/a&gt;, Weaving's performance was described by Peter Gotting of \"The Guardian\" as \"the role of his career\".\nIn October 2015, Weaving joined the cast of the film adaption of &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Silvey\"&gt;Craig Silvey&lt;/a&gt;'s novel \"&lt;a href=\"Jasper%20Jones\"&gt;Jasper Jones&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2018, Weaving starred as Thaddeus Valentine in \"&lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Engines%20%28film%29\"&gt;Mortal Engines&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2020, Weaving starred as Alfred in &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Kushner\"&gt;Tony Kushner&lt;/a&gt;'s adaptation of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Visit%20%28play%29\"&gt;The Visit&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPersonal life.\nWhen he was 13 years old, Weaving was diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"epilepsy\"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;. Although this disability rarely affected him and stopped completely after he turned 18, he still chooses not to drive, given the risk of potential seizures. He has been with his longtime girlfriend Katrina Greenwood since 1984; the two live in Sydney and have two children together, Harry (b. 1989) and Holly (b. 1993). Harry is an actor who uses the stage name Harry Greenwood. Hugo also has a brother, Simon, and a sister, Anna Jane. He is the uncle of actress &lt;a href=\"Samara%20Weaving\"&gt;Samara Weaving&lt;/a&gt;, who also began her career in Australia before transitioning to American roles. Both appeared in the 2013 Australian film \"&lt;a href=\"Mystery%20Road%20%28film%29\"&gt;Mystery Road&lt;/a&gt;\". His younger niece Morgan Weaving appeared on the Australian soap opera \"&lt;a href=\"Home%20and%20Away\"&gt;Home and Away&lt;/a&gt;\" alongside her sister.\nIn 2004, Weaving became an ambassador for Australian &lt;a href=\"animal%20rights\"&gt;animal rights&lt;/a&gt; organisation &lt;a href=\"Voiceless_%28animal_rights_group%29\"&gt;Voiceless&lt;/a&gt;, the animal protection institute.
