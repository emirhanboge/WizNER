    "text": " \nOver 22,500 species of &lt;a href=\"wildlife\"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt; have been recorded in &lt;a href=\"North%20Macedonia\"&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of these are &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s, with &lt;a href=\"invertebrate\"&gt;invertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s making up over half of the total species of recorded wildlife. Of these, the vast majority are &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s, which include over 10,000 identified species. Over 3000 of these insects are &lt;a href=\"beetle\"&gt;beetle&lt;/a&gt;s, with other large clades including &lt;a href=\"Lepidoptera\"&gt;Lepidoptera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fly\"&gt;flies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hymenoptera\"&gt;Hymenoptera&lt;/a&gt;. Other &lt;a href=\"arthropod\"&gt;arthropod&lt;/a&gt;s invertebrate groups include &lt;a href=\"Chelicerata\"&gt;Chelicerata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"crustacean\"&gt;crustacean&lt;/a&gt;s. Among &lt;a href=\"vertebrate\"&gt;vertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s, there have been over 300 species of birds recorded at some point, although not all nest in the area. There are over 80 species of both &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mammal\"&gt;mammal&lt;/a&gt;s, 32 &lt;a href=\"reptile\"&gt;reptile&lt;/a&gt;s, and 14 &lt;a href=\"amphibian\"&gt;amphibian&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOver 4200 &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s have been identified, with over 3700 of these being &lt;a href=\"vascular%20plant\"&gt;vascular plant&lt;/a&gt;s. Forested area has expanded slightly in recent years, although this expansion was not shared evenly by different forest types. More than half of the country's forested area is considered &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt;. Over 2000 species of &lt;a href=\"algae\"&gt;algae&lt;/a&gt; have been found, most of them within lakes. There are also 2000 species &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;, with 90% of these being &lt;a href=\"Basidiomycota\"&gt;Basidiomycota&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to these species, at least 450 &lt;a href=\"lichen\"&gt;lichen&lt;/a&gt;s are present. A number of animal and plant species have become &lt;a href=\"Local%20extinction\"&gt;locally extinct&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe country covers , with much of the terrain being mountainous. Significant variation in topography has contributed to large variation within local climates, which together with the presence of ice age &lt;a href=\"Refugium%20%28population%20biology%29\"&gt;refugia&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in significant diversity and &lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemism&lt;/a&gt;. Although North Macedonia is &lt;a href=\"Landlocked%20country\"&gt;landlocked&lt;/a&gt;, it has &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rivers%20of%20North%20Macedonia\"&gt;numerous rivers&lt;/a&gt; and lakes supporting aquatic wildlife. The forest and caves in the west of the country support a number of unique and endangered animals. The three largest lakes, &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ohrid\"&gt;Lake Ohrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Prespa\"&gt;Lake Prespa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Dojran\"&gt;Lake Dojran&lt;/a&gt;, are further areas of relatively high diversity.\nThere is substantial interaction between people and wildlife, especially in rural areas. Various plant and fungi species are &lt;a href=\"Foraging\"&gt;foraged&lt;/a&gt; for local use and for export, and many animal species are &lt;a href=\"Hunting\"&gt;hunted&lt;/a&gt;. Other threats to wildlife include &lt;a href=\"land%20use\"&gt;land use&lt;/a&gt; change, &lt;a href=\"pollution\"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"climate%20change\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;. A variety of laws protect some species and habitats and regulate their use. A number of action plans have been developed by &lt;a href=\"Politics%20of%20North%20Macedonia%23Executive%20branch\"&gt;the Government&lt;/a&gt;, covering topics including the environment, biodiversity, and water. &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20national%20parks%20in%20North%20Macedonia\"&gt;Three national parks&lt;/a&gt; have been established, and North Macedonia is party to a number of European and International conventions that relate to wildlife and the environment.\nEnvironment.\n&lt;a href=\"North%20Macedonia\"&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; spans in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkan Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"landlocked%20country\"&gt;landlocked country&lt;/a&gt; is centred around the &lt;a href=\"Vardar\"&gt;Vardar&lt;/a&gt; river valley, with the national borders being marked by mountain ranges. Its diverse landscape creates a variety of local climates, which can be divided into 8 &lt;a href=\"Biome%23History%20of%20the%20concept\"&gt;zonobiomes/orobiomes&lt;/a&gt;. The varied habitats of the country, including both natural and man-made environments, can be divided into 28 broad types, which are further subdivided into 120 at the third level of &lt;a href=\"European%20Nature%20Information%20System\"&gt;EUNIS&lt;/a&gt; classification. These are spread across 38 classes of landscapes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Geography%20of%20North%20Macedonia%23Climate\"&gt;overall climate&lt;/a&gt; is temperate, with the area undergoing four seasons throughout the year. However, the varied geography means that there is significant local climatic variety. Precipitation also varies significantly. The mountains can receive up to of snow.\nNorth Macedonia contains of &lt;a href=\"surface%20water\"&gt;surface water&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rivers%20of%20North%20Macedonia\"&gt;35 rivers&lt;/a&gt; fall into 3 river basins, one of each which flow into the &lt;a href=\"Aegean%20Sea\"&gt;Aegean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the country, , falls within the Agean Basin, which contains &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Dojran\"&gt;Lake Dojran&lt;/a&gt;. of this basin is covered by the Vardar and its tributaries. The remaining of the Aegean drainage basin is covered by the &lt;a href=\"Strumica%20%28river%29\"&gt;Strumica&lt;/a&gt; river and its tributaries. The main river of the Adriatic basin is &lt;a href=\"Black%20Drim\"&gt;Black Drim&lt;/a&gt;, which begins at &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ohrid\"&gt;Lake Ohrid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Prespa\"&gt;Lake Prespa&lt;/a&gt; also falls within this basin. Under some accounting there are also three minor drainage basins, which combined cover just over 1% of North Macedonia.\nAltogether, lakes cover 2% of the country, about . The three largest lakes mentioned above are &lt;a href=\"Lake%23Tectonic%20lakes\"&gt;tectonic lakes&lt;/a&gt;. Lake Ohrid is , and has an average depth of . It is thought to be 2-3\u00a0million years old. Lake Prespa is , with an average depth of . Lake Dojran is , with a maximum depth of just . These three lakes are split between North Macedonia and neighbouring countries. Around 43 &lt;a href=\"Lake%23Glacial%20lakes\"&gt;glacial lakes&lt;/a&gt; exist in the mountains. There are also 111 are artificial lakes, including large reservoirs.\nA complex geological history means the country's surface rocks originate from many periods of Earth's history. There are about &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20mountains%20in%20North%20Macedonia\"&gt;13 mountains&lt;/a&gt; whose heights exceed , with &lt;a href=\"Korab%20%28mountain%29\"&gt;the highest&lt;/a&gt; being above sea level. Around 50% of the country is considered mountainous. These mountains are separated by gorges and valleys. Caves, especially in limestone mountains found in the west, support a variety of cave fauna, and contain their own lakes.\n of the country is considered forested, of which 90% is state-owned land. of land is classified as &lt;a href=\"Agriculture\"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it is either currently used to generate nutrients or could in quick measure be used for such purposes. 757,000 of this area is currently &lt;a href=\"pasture\"&gt;pasture&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPlants.\nAt least 3700 species of &lt;a href=\"vascular%20plant\"&gt;vascular plant&lt;/a&gt;s have been found, of which 116 are &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; of near-endemic. 3200 of these species are &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt;s. Additionally, there are 573 non-vascular plant species (none of which are endemic). Eight of these are protected. Over 400 of these species are &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;es, while 100 are &lt;a href=\"Marchantiophyta\"&gt;Marchantiophyta&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe estimated wood mass in the country was 74,343,000 m3 in 2008. &lt;a href=\"Forest\"&gt;Forest&lt;/a&gt;ed land expanded by 3.5% in the decade leading up to 2013, reflecting a decrease in annual &lt;a href=\"logging\"&gt;logging&lt;/a&gt;, efforts to expand forested area, and a reduction in &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt;. This recovery is not shared by all forest types however, with &lt;a href=\"Pinophyta\"&gt;coniferous&lt;/a&gt; and mixed forest coverage reducing in size. As of 2013, 58% of the forest was &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt;, 30% was mixed, 7% was coniferous, and 5% was considered degraded. Some deliberate forestation has been undertaken with the invasive \"&lt;a href=\"Robinia%20pseudoacacia\"&gt;Robinia pseudoacacia&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Ailanthus%20altissima\"&gt;Ailanthus altissima&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBroadleaf tree woodlands, dominated by &lt;a href=\"alder\"&gt;alder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"birch\"&gt;birch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Populus\"&gt;poplar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"willow\"&gt;willow&lt;/a&gt; species, are some of the country's most endangered habitats. Swamp woodlands are dominated by \"&lt;a href=\"Alnus%20glutinosa\"&gt;Alnus glutinosa&lt;/a&gt;\". Beech forests are dominated by &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;s and \"&lt;a href=\"Fagus%20%28plant%29\"&gt;Fagus&lt;/a&gt;\" species. Oaks, \"&lt;a href=\"Carpinus%20orientalis\"&gt;Carpinus orientalis&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"chestnut\"&gt;chestnut&lt;/a&gt;s, and \"&lt;a href=\"Ostrya\"&gt;Ostrya&lt;/a&gt;\" dominate deciduous woodlands. Other habitats contain many conifer species.\n314 species of flowering plants (11% of all flowering plants in the country) are protected. 14 species of vascular plants assessed by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Environment%20Programme\"&gt;United Nations Environment Programme&lt;/a&gt; are considered at a risk of extinction: four are critically endangered, five are endangered, and five are vulnerable. Only 11 Macedonian species appear in the &lt;a href=\"Berne%20Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20European%20Wildlife%20and%20Natural%20Habitats\"&gt;Bern Convention&lt;/a&gt;, whereas five are listed in &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Habitats%20Directive\"&gt;Habitats Directive&lt;/a&gt; appendices.\nPlant species that have become &lt;a href=\"Local%20extinction\"&gt;extinct from the county&lt;/a&gt; include \"&lt;a href=\"Acorus%20calamus\"&gt;Acorus calamus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Sagittaria%20sagittifolia\"&gt;Sagittaria sagittifolia&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Lysimachia%20thyrsiflora\"&gt;Lysimachia thyrsiflora&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Aldrovanda%20vesiculosa\"&gt;Aldrovanda vesiculosa&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Nymphaea%20alba\"&gt;Nymphaea alba&lt;/a&gt;\". Others, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Jacobaea%20paludosa\"&gt;Jacobaea paludosa&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Ranunculus%20lingua\"&gt;Ranunculus lingua&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Gentiana%20pneumonanthe\"&gt;Gentiana pneumonanthe&lt;/a&gt;\", are near locally extinct if not extinct already. \"&lt;a href=\"Carex\"&gt;Carex&lt;/a&gt; elata\" is also on the brink of extinction.\nFungi.\n2000 &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; taxa have been found, although none are them endemic. Around 1800 belong to &lt;a href=\"Basidiomycota\"&gt;Basidiomycota&lt;/a&gt; (including 550 within &lt;a href=\"Agaricales\"&gt;Agaricales&lt;/a&gt; and 450 within &lt;a href=\"Aphyllophorales\"&gt;Aphyllophorales&lt;/a&gt;), while 200 species are &lt;a href=\"Ascomycota\"&gt;Ascomycota&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, at least 450 species of &lt;a href=\"lichen\"&gt;lichen&lt;/a&gt;s have been identified.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Entomophaga%20maimaiga\"&gt;Entomophaga maimaiga&lt;/a&gt;\", an &lt;a href=\"entomopathogenic%20fungus\"&gt;entomopathogenic fungus&lt;/a&gt;, is found on &lt;a href=\"Lymantria%20dispar\"&gt;gypsy moths&lt;/a&gt;, following its introduction in neighbouring Bulgaria as a way to control the moth.\n122 of Fungi species have been identified as threatened within North Macedonia. 213 species from the ascomycetes and basidiomycetes have been preliminarily assessed for &lt;a href=\"IUCN%20Red%20List\"&gt;IUCN Red List&lt;/a&gt; status. From these, 21 were critically endangered, 30 endangered, 71 vulnerable, 40 near threatened, 9 least concern, and 42 data deficient.\nAnimals.\nInvertebrates.\nThere are 13,493 recorded &lt;a href=\"invertebrate\"&gt;invertebrate&lt;/a&gt; species in North Macedonia. The vast majority of these (90%) are &lt;a href=\"arthropod\"&gt;arthropod&lt;/a&gt;s.\n6 of the 10 &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;s found in the three major lakes are endemic. \"&lt;a href=\"Eunapius%20carteri\"&gt;Eunapius carteri&lt;/a&gt; dojranensis\" is endemic to Lake Doyran. \"&lt;a href=\"Ochridaspongia%20rotunda\"&gt;Ochridaspongia rotunda&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Ochridospongia%20interlithonis\"&gt;Ochridospongia interlithonis&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Ochridospongilla%20stankovici\"&gt;Ochridospongilla stankovici&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Spongilla%20stankovici\"&gt;Spongilla stankovici&lt;/a&gt;\" are endemic to Lake Ohrid. \"&lt;a href=\"Spongilla\"&gt;Spongilla&lt;/a&gt; prespensis\" is endemic to Lake Prespa.\n&lt;a href=\"Annelid\"&gt;Annelid&lt;/a&gt;s consist of 140 &lt;a href=\"Oligochaeta\"&gt;Oligochaeta&lt;/a&gt;, 30 &lt;a href=\"leech\"&gt;leech&lt;/a&gt;es, and 5 &lt;a href=\"Branchiobdellida\"&gt;Branchiobdellida&lt;/a&gt;. 53 of the 180 identified annelids species are endemic, all in Lake Ohrid. 38 of these endemic species are oligochaetes, and 11 are &lt;a href=\"Hirudinea\"&gt;Hirudinea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mollusca\"&gt;Mollusca&lt;/a&gt; species represented are mostly &lt;a href=\"Gastropoda\"&gt;Gastropoda&lt;/a&gt;, which have 301 species. At least 195 of these are land snails, and 107 are aquatic snails. The remaining 19 mollusc species are &lt;a href=\"Bivalvia\"&gt;Bivalvia&lt;/a&gt;. Of 92 molluscs considered endemic, 88 of them are gastropods and four of them are bivalves. One gastropod species in Lake Prespa is invasive.\n870 &lt;a href=\"nematode\"&gt;nematode&lt;/a&gt; species have been identified. Aside from nematode species that live in lakes, there are at least 450 forest-dwelling species, and 80 plant &lt;a href=\"parasite\"&gt;parasite&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOf the three &lt;a href=\"Cnidaria\"&gt;Cnidaria&lt;/a&gt; species, one is invasive. The 229 &lt;a href=\"flatworm\"&gt;flatworm&lt;/a&gt;s are made up of 158 &lt;a href=\"Neodermata\"&gt;Neodermata&lt;/a&gt; and 71 &lt;a href=\"Turbellaria\"&gt;Turbellaria&lt;/a&gt;. The two known &lt;a href=\"Nematomorpha\"&gt;Nematomorpha&lt;/a&gt; species known are \"&lt;a href=\"Gordius%20nonmaculatus\"&gt;Gordius nonmaculatus&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Gordius%20aquaticus\"&gt;Gordius aquaticus&lt;/a&gt;\". The only known &lt;a href=\"Nemertea\"&gt;Nemertea&lt;/a&gt; species is \"&lt;a href=\"Prostoma%20graecense\"&gt;Prostoma graecense&lt;/a&gt;\", which was found in Lake Ohrid.\nArthropods.\nAt least 11,800 arthropod species have been identified. Of the 1126 &lt;a href=\"Chelicerata\"&gt;Chelicerata&lt;/a&gt; species present, at least 60 are considered endemic. The most numerous order within Chelicerata is that of &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, of which there are 767 species (nine of which are endemic). The next largest taxa is the &lt;a href=\"Acari\"&gt;Acari&lt;/a&gt;, whose 250 species include 164 &lt;a href=\"Hydrachnidia\"&gt;Hydrachnidia&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"Halacaridae\"&gt;Halacaridae&lt;/a&gt;. Within Halacroidea, the &lt;a href=\"Monotypic%20taxon\"&gt;monotypic&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Stygohalacarus\"&gt;Stygohalacarus&lt;/a&gt;\" genus, represented by \"Stygohalacarus scupiensis\", is endemic to North Macedonia, as is \"&lt;a href=\"Copidognathus%20profundus\"&gt;Copidognathus profundus&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Dolomedes%23Europe\"&gt;fen raft spider&lt;/a&gt;, living in marshes near Mount &lt;a href=\"Belasica\"&gt;Belasica&lt;/a&gt;, is known to eat fish. The remaining identified Cherlicerata species are 54 &lt;a href=\"pseudoscorpion\"&gt;pseudoscorpion&lt;/a&gt;s, 50 &lt;a href=\"opiliones\"&gt;opiliones&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s, and two &lt;a href=\"Solifugae\"&gt;Solifugae&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Galeodes\"&gt;Galeodes&lt;/a&gt; elegans\" and \"Galeodes graceus\"). 19 Opiliones are endemic, along with 16 pseudoscopions.\nInsects.\nWith a total of at least 10,081 species, &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s make up around 85% of the country's arthropods.\nThere are 175 identified &lt;a href=\"orthoptera\"&gt;orthoptera&lt;/a&gt; species. One, \"&lt;a href=\"Bradyporus\"&gt;Bradyporus&lt;/a&gt; macrogaster macrogaste\", is critically endangered. Four are considered endangered, and another 8 are considered vulnerable (and another 10 are data deficient). Some species are known only from a single location, or even a single record.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Hemiptera\"&gt;Hemiptera&lt;/a&gt;, 776 species of &lt;a href=\"Heteroptera\"&gt;Heteroptera&lt;/a&gt; (15 endemic) identified. However, local expertise in this taxon is lacking, and it has been suggested that the discovered number makes up only 62% of the total number, taking into account the rate of new discoveries, the diversity of habitats, and studies from neighbouring countries. Knowledge about &lt;a href=\"Homoptera\"&gt;Homoptera&lt;/a&gt; is very limited, with most studies covering small numbers of species from specific locations. The known Homoptera consist of 134 &lt;a href=\"Sternorrhyncha\"&gt;Sternorrhyncha&lt;/a&gt;, 15 &lt;a href=\"Cicadomorpha\"&gt;Cicadomorpha&lt;/a&gt;, and 13 &lt;a href=\"Fulgoromorpha\"&gt;Fulgoromorpha&lt;/a&gt;.\nA total of 2,638 &lt;a href=\"Lepidoptera\"&gt;Lepidoptera&lt;/a&gt; species have been &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Lepidoptera%20of%20North%20Macedonia\"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt;. These are split between 68 families, with species numbers within these ranging from a single species to 528 species (the &lt;a href=\"Noctuidae\"&gt;Noctuidae&lt;/a&gt;). 67 species have been provisionally assessed for IUCN Red List status within North Macedonia. One has been identified as endangered, with 15 being vulnerable and 24 being near threatened.\nIt is thought there are over 1,500 species of &lt;a href=\"Fly\"&gt;flies&lt;/a&gt;, representing 54 families. The largest family is that of the &lt;a href=\"Hoverfly\"&gt;hoverflies&lt;/a&gt;, which is represented by 262 species. Some flies are considered potential &lt;a href=\"Vector%20%28epidemiology%29\"&gt;disease vectors&lt;/a&gt;, and one, \"&lt;a href=\"Obolodiplosis\"&gt;Obolodiplosis&lt;/a&gt; robiniae\", is invasive.\nThere are perhaps 106 &lt;a href=\"caddisfly\"&gt;caddisfly&lt;/a&gt; species, although estimates vary. The 68 species of identified &lt;a href=\"Neuropterida\"&gt;Neuropterida&lt;/a&gt; consist of 59 &lt;a href=\"Neuroptera\"&gt;Neuroptera&lt;/a&gt; and 9 &lt;a href=\"Snakefly\"&gt;Raphidioptera&lt;/a&gt;. The 13 known &lt;a href=\"flea\"&gt;flea&lt;/a&gt; species include species which are parasites of the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20snow%20vole\"&gt;Balkan snow vole&lt;/a&gt;. The country has 68 identified &lt;a href=\"Mayfly\"&gt;mayflies&lt;/a&gt;, which include seven \"&lt;a href=\"Rhithrogena\"&gt;Rhithrogena&lt;/a&gt;\" species, all found in the &lt;a href=\"Pena%20%28river%29\"&gt;Pena river&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnown &lt;a href=\"Dictyoptera\"&gt;Dictyoptera&lt;/a&gt; include 12 &lt;a href=\"cockroach\"&gt;cockroach&lt;/a&gt;es, four &lt;a href=\"mantis\"&gt;mantis&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"termite\"&gt;termite&lt;/a&gt;s. Of the 14 &lt;a href=\"Louse\"&gt;lice&lt;/a&gt; species known, two, \"&lt;a href=\"Enderleinellus%20ferrisi\"&gt;Enderleinellus ferrisi&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Schizophthirus%20gliris\"&gt;Schizophthirus gliris&lt;/a&gt;\", are parasites (of &lt;a href=\"European%20ground%20squirrel\"&gt;European ground squirrel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Edible%20dormouse\"&gt;edible dormice&lt;/a&gt; respectively). \"&lt;a href=\"Haploembia%20solieri\"&gt;Haploembia solieri&lt;/a&gt;\", which was found in &lt;a href=\"Valandovo\"&gt;Valandovo&lt;/a&gt;, is the only recorded &lt;a href=\"Embioptera\"&gt;Embioptera&lt;/a&gt; species.\nOther insect species include 97 &lt;a href=\"Plecoptera\"&gt;Plecoptera&lt;/a&gt; (10 of which are endemic), 64 &lt;a href=\"Odonata\"&gt;Odonata&lt;/a&gt;, 49 &lt;a href=\"Psocoptera\"&gt;Psocoptera&lt;/a&gt;, 42 &lt;a href=\"Thrips\"&gt;Thysanoptera&lt;/a&gt;, five &lt;a href=\"Earwig\"&gt;Dermaptera&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href=\"Archaeognatha\"&gt;Archaeognatha&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Mecoptera\"&gt;Mecoptera&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"Strepsiptera\"&gt;Strepsiptera&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Hylecthrus%20rubi\"&gt;Hylecthrus rubi&lt;/a&gt;\"), and one &lt;a href=\"Zygentoma\"&gt;Zygentoma&lt;/a&gt;. There is no data for &lt;a href=\"Megaloptera\"&gt;Megaloptera&lt;/a&gt; within the country.\n&lt;a href=\"Hymenoptera\"&gt;Hymenoptera&lt;/a&gt; is another diverse order, represented by about 1077 species. One relatively well-studied group are &lt;a href=\"parasitoid%20wasp\"&gt;parasitoid wasp&lt;/a&gt;s. 150 species of &lt;a href=\"Braconidae\"&gt;Braconidae&lt;/a&gt; have been found. The 129 &lt;a href=\"Ichneumonidae\"&gt;Ichneumonidae&lt;/a&gt; species (21 of which fall within &lt;a href=\"Cryptinae\"&gt;Cryptinae&lt;/a&gt;) present include three endemics: \"&lt;a href=\"Hadrodactylus%20tiphae%20balcanicus\"&gt;Hadrodactylus tiphae balcanicus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Mesochorus\"&gt;Mesochorus&lt;/a&gt; venerandus\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Gelis\"&gt;Gelis&lt;/a&gt; balcanicus\". &lt;a href=\"Eulophidae\"&gt;Eulophidae&lt;/a&gt; has 40 species. Non-parasitic &lt;a href=\"wasp\"&gt;wasp&lt;/a&gt;s include 75 members of the family &lt;a href=\"Vespidae\"&gt;Vespidae&lt;/a&gt; and 37 members of the family &lt;a href=\"Mutillidae\"&gt;Mutillidae&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to wasps, there are at least 113 &lt;a href=\"Apidae\"&gt;Apidae&lt;/a&gt; bee species and 99 &lt;a href=\"ant\"&gt;ant&lt;/a&gt; species.\nBeetles.\nAt least 3,145 &lt;a href=\"beetle\"&gt;beetle&lt;/a&gt; species have been identified, split between 84 families. The &lt;a href=\"ground%20beetle\"&gt;ground beetle&lt;/a&gt;s make up a large number of these, represented by 573 species. Within the &lt;a href=\"Staphylinoidea\"&gt;Staphylinoidea&lt;/a&gt; superfamily there are 516 species. These include representatives of the &lt;a href=\"Rove%20beetle\"&gt;Staphylinidae&lt;/a&gt; (383 species), &lt;a href=\"Cholevinae\"&gt;Cholevinae&lt;/a&gt; (57), &lt;a href=\"Hydraenidae\"&gt;Hydraenidae&lt;/a&gt; (42), &lt;a href=\"Silphidae\"&gt;Silphidae&lt;/a&gt; (14), &lt;a href=\"Ptiliidae\"&gt;Ptiliidae&lt;/a&gt; (4), and &lt;a href=\"Agyrtidae\"&gt;Agyrtidae&lt;/a&gt; (1) families.\n&lt;a href=\"Water%20beetle\"&gt;Water beetle&lt;/a&gt;s have been identified from the &lt;a href=\"Dytiscidae\"&gt;Dytiscidae&lt;/a&gt; (62), &lt;a href=\"Haliplidae\"&gt;Haliplidae&lt;/a&gt; (11), &lt;a href=\"Whirligig%20beetle\"&gt;Gyrinidae&lt;/a&gt; (6), and &lt;a href=\"Noteridae\"&gt;Noteridae&lt;/a&gt; (2) families. Within &lt;a href=\"Hydrophiloidea\"&gt;Hydrophiloidea&lt;/a&gt;, there are 68 &lt;a href=\"Histeridae\"&gt;Histeridae&lt;/a&gt; species and 33 &lt;a href=\"Hydrophilidae\"&gt;Hydrophilidae&lt;/a&gt; species.\nThere are 14 families of &lt;a href=\"Scarabaeoidea\"&gt;Scarabaeoidea&lt;/a&gt; represented, which altogether contain 172 species. Within &lt;a href=\"Cucujoidea\"&gt;Cucujoidea&lt;/a&gt;, there are perhaps over 200 species, of which 116 are &lt;a href=\"Sap%20beetle\"&gt;Nitidulidae&lt;/a&gt; and 33 are &lt;a href=\"Coccinellidae\"&gt;Coccinellidae&lt;/a&gt;. Within &lt;a href=\"Chrysomeloidea\"&gt;Chrysomeloidea&lt;/a&gt;, there are 340 &lt;a href=\"leaf%20beetle\"&gt;leaf beetle&lt;/a&gt;s and 176 &lt;a href=\"longhorn%20beetle\"&gt;longhorn beetle&lt;/a&gt;s. The 88 species of &lt;a href=\"Bostrichiformia\"&gt;Bostrichiformia&lt;/a&gt; are split between four families: &lt;a href=\"Bostrichidae\"&gt;Bostrichidae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dermestidae\"&gt;Dermestidae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ptinidae\"&gt;Ptinidae&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nosodendridae\"&gt;Nosodendridae&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are 44 identified &lt;a href=\"Cleroidea\"&gt;Cleroidea&lt;/a&gt; species. 17 each are from &lt;a href=\"Malachiinae\"&gt;Malachiinae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dasytinae\"&gt;Dasytinae&lt;/a&gt;. One Dasytidae species is endemic to the &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0ar%20Mountains\"&gt;\u0160ar Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining 10 are from the &lt;a href=\"Cleridae\"&gt;Cleridae&lt;/a&gt; family.\nThere are 100 species of &lt;a href=\"Elateroidea\"&gt;Elateroidea&lt;/a&gt;. Most are &lt;a href=\"click%20beetle\"&gt;click beetle&lt;/a&gt;s (74), with the rest being &lt;a href=\"soldier%20beetle\"&gt;soldier beetle&lt;/a&gt;s (15), &lt;a href=\"Firefly\"&gt;fireflies&lt;/a&gt; (7), and &lt;a href=\"Lycidae\"&gt;net-winged beetles&lt;/a&gt; (4).\nOther beetles include 290 &lt;a href=\"Curculionidae\"&gt;Curculionidae&lt;/a&gt; and 45 &lt;a href=\"darkling%20beetle\"&gt;darkling beetle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCrustaceans.\nOf the 490 &lt;a href=\"crustacean\"&gt;crustacean&lt;/a&gt; species found, 133 are considered endemic.\nWithin the class &lt;a href=\"Branchiopoda\"&gt;Branchiopoda&lt;/a&gt;, the most numerous order is &lt;a href=\"Diplostraca\"&gt;Diplostraca&lt;/a&gt;, which has 86 species. \"&lt;a href=\"Alona%20smirnovi\"&gt;Alona smirnovi&lt;/a&gt;\" is endemic to Lake Ohrid. Of the other orders, there are six species of &lt;a href=\"Anostraca\"&gt;Anostraca&lt;/a&gt;, including \"&lt;a href=\"Chirocephalus%20pelagonicus\"&gt;Chirocephalus pelagonicus&lt;/a&gt;\" which is endemic to wetlands in the &lt;a href=\"Pelagonia\"&gt;Pelagonia&lt;/a&gt; plain. The two species of order &lt;a href=\"Notostraca\"&gt;Notostraca&lt;/a&gt; (which contains only the &lt;a href=\"Triopsidae\"&gt;Triopsidae&lt;/a&gt; family) present are \"&lt;a href=\"Lepidurus%20apus\"&gt;Lepidurus apus&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Triops%20cancriformis\"&gt;Triops cancriformis&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAll 172 representatives of the &lt;a href=\"ostracod\"&gt;ostracod&lt;/a&gt;s are from the order &lt;a href=\"Podocopida\"&gt;Podocopida&lt;/a&gt;. Numerous genera within this order have high levels of endemism.\nOf the class &lt;a href=\"Maxillopoda\"&gt;Maxillopoda&lt;/a&gt;, 146 species are &lt;a href=\"copepod\"&gt;copepod&lt;/a&gt;s: 60 &lt;a href=\"Cyclopoida\"&gt;Cyclopoida&lt;/a&gt;, 54 &lt;a href=\"Harpacticoida\"&gt;Harpacticoida&lt;/a&gt;, 30 &lt;a href=\"Calanoida\"&gt;Calanoida&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"Poecilostomatoida\"&gt;Poecilostomatoida&lt;/a&gt;. Both Cyclopoida and Harpacticoida contain several endemic genera. 12 of these copepods are known to be parasitic, found infecting fish in the major lakes. Other Maxillopoda include three &lt;a href=\"Branchiura\"&gt;Branchiura&lt;/a&gt;, all from the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Argulus\"&gt;Argulus&lt;/a&gt;\" within the class &lt;a href=\"Argulidae\"&gt;Argulidae&lt;/a&gt;. One, \"&lt;a href=\"Argulus%20foliaceus\"&gt;Argulus foliaceus&lt;/a&gt;\", is a parasite of at least three fish species. There is one representative of the &lt;a href=\"Pentastomida\"&gt;Pentastomida&lt;/a&gt; known: \"&lt;a href=\"Linguatula%20serrata\"&gt;Linguatula serrata&lt;/a&gt;\", which is a human parasite.\nThere are representatives of four orders of &lt;a href=\"Malacostraca\"&gt;Malacostraca&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Isopoda\"&gt;Isopoda&lt;/a&gt; is represented by 50 species, of which about a third are endemic. &lt;a href=\"Amphipoda\"&gt;Amphipoda&lt;/a&gt; is represented by 47 species, with five genera (\"&lt;a href=\"Bogidiella\"&gt;Bogidiella&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Gammarus\"&gt;Gammarus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Niphargus\"&gt;Niphargus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Hadzia\"&gt;Hadzia&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Ignolfiella\"&gt;Ignolfiella&lt;/a&gt;\") containing many endemic species. &lt;a href=\"Decapoda\"&gt;Decapoda&lt;/a&gt; is represented by five species: two &lt;a href=\"Astacidae\"&gt;Astacidae&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Austropotamobius%20torrentium\"&gt;Austropotamobius torrentium&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Astacus%20astacus\"&gt;Astacus astacus&lt;/a&gt;\"), two &lt;a href=\"Potamidae\"&gt;Potamidae&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Potamon%20fluviatile\"&gt;Potamon fluviatile&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Potamon%20ibericum\"&gt;Potamon ibericum&lt;/a&gt;\"), and one &lt;a href=\"Atyidae\"&gt;Atyidae&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Atyaephyra%20stankoi\"&gt;Atyaephyra stankoi&lt;/a&gt;\", which was found in Lake Dojran). &lt;a href=\"Bathynellacea\"&gt;Bathynellacea&lt;/a&gt; is represented by three species: \"&lt;a href=\"Bathynella%20natans\"&gt;Bathynella natans&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Parabathynella%20stygia\"&gt;Parabathynella stygia&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Bathynella%20chappuisi\"&gt;Bathynella chappuisi&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThere are around 100 species of &lt;a href=\"Myriapoda\"&gt;Myriapoda&lt;/a&gt;, including 18 endemic &lt;a href=\"millipede\"&gt;millipede&lt;/a&gt;s. There are 21 identified species of &lt;a href=\"Entognatha\"&gt;Entognatha&lt;/a&gt;, including 11 &lt;a href=\"Springtail\"&gt;Collembola&lt;/a&gt;, eight &lt;a href=\"Protura\"&gt;Protura&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Diplura\"&gt;Diplura&lt;/a&gt;.\nFish.\nThe number of &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; species is disputed due to taxonomic uncertainty. One calculation identifies 85 &lt;a href=\"Actinopterygii\"&gt;Actinopterygii&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"lamprey\"&gt;lamprey&lt;/a&gt;s. Of these, 27 are endemic, and 19 are invasive. Some fish are endemic to certain lakes or rivers. Lake Ohrid has 21 native species, of which eight are endemic, and seven are introduced species. Lake Prespa has 11 native species, of which eight are endemic, and 12 are introduced species. Lake Dojran has 12 native species, one of which is endemic, and two of which are introduced species.\nOf the Actinopterygii, the &lt;a href=\"European%20sea%20sturgeon\"&gt;European sea sturgeon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"European%20eel\"&gt;European eel&lt;/a&gt;, and \"&lt;a href=\"Alburnus%20macedonicus\"&gt;Alburnus macedonicus&lt;/a&gt;\" are considered critically endangered, and the &lt;a href=\"Prespa%20minnow\"&gt;Prespa minnow&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Salmo%20peristericus\"&gt;Salmo peristericus&lt;/a&gt;\" are considered endangered. A further 10 species are vulnerable, one near threatened, and 10 data deficient. &lt;a href=\"Salmonidae\"&gt;Salmonidae&lt;/a&gt; species in Orhid Lake are endangered, while the &lt;a href=\"common%20carp\"&gt;common carp&lt;/a&gt; is endangered in Lake Prespa.\nThe two lamprey species are the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20brook%20lamprey\"&gt;Ukrainian brook lamprey&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Eudontomyzon%20stankokaramani\"&gt;Eudontomyzon stankokaramani&lt;/a&gt;\". The first lives in the Vardar's drainage basin, while the second lives in the Adriatic Sea basin. Both are protected by law.\nAmphibians.\nThe &lt;a href=\"amphibian\"&gt;amphibian&lt;/a&gt; species found comprise nine &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;s, and five &lt;a href=\"salamander\"&gt;salamander&lt;/a&gt;s. Three of these have been categorized as endangered, three as vulnerable, three as near threatened, and five as least concern. Considering the effects of disease and habitat loss, that proportion of threatened amphibian species is roughly in line with the state of amphibians worldwide. None of these species are endemic to the country, although two are endemic to the Balkans.\nReptiles.\nThe 32 species of &lt;a href=\"reptile\"&gt;reptile&lt;/a&gt;s present are made up of 16 &lt;a href=\"snake\"&gt;snake&lt;/a&gt;s, 12 &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, and four &lt;a href=\"tortoise\"&gt;tortoise&lt;/a&gt;s. Within North Macedonia, 11 of these species are widespread, 10 are restricted to certain habitats, and 11 have very limited range. While none of these are endemic to the country, two are endemic to the Balkans.\nOf those with IUCN Red List assessments, seven of them are endangered, six are vulnerable, eight are near threatened, and ten are of least concern. The globally vulnerable \"&lt;a href=\"Vipera%20ursinii\"&gt;Vipera ursinii&lt;/a&gt;\", one of three &lt;a href=\"Viperidae\"&gt;Viperidae&lt;/a&gt; in North Macedonia, has strict protection, while another 22 species have some level of protection. &lt;a href=\"Hermann%27s%20tortoise\"&gt;Hermann's tortoise&lt;/a&gt;, found in forest and meadows, are expected to lost at least one third of their population over the next 75 years.\nAnother snake species present is the &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20whipsnake\"&gt;Caspian whipsnake&lt;/a&gt;, Europe's largest snake.\nBirds.\nThere are 318 &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; species whose presence has been confirmed, and an additional 16 for which there are less reliable claims. None of these birds are endemic. 215 of these species &lt;a href=\"nest\"&gt;nest&lt;/a&gt; in the country.\n106 bird species have some level of protection under law. At least eight nesting species have become locally extinct, while another 7-15 no longer nest in the area. Many species have fewer than 100 nesting couples present.\nMammals.\nAt least 85 mammal species inhabit the area, of which four are endemic to the Balkans: the &lt;a href=\"western%20broad-toothed%20field%20mouse\"&gt;western broad-toothed field mouse&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20snow%20vole\"&gt;Balkan snow vole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felten%27s%20vole\"&gt;Felten's vole&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20mole\"&gt;Balkan mole&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"chamois\"&gt;chamois&lt;/a&gt; sub-species \"Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica\" and lynx sub-species the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20lynx\"&gt;Balkan lynx&lt;/a&gt; are endemic to the Balkans, and have core populations within North Macedonia. It has also been suggested that the country's &lt;a href=\"European%20ground%20squirrel\"&gt;European ground squirrel&lt;/a&gt; population be considered its own sub-species. Eight mammal species are considered invasive.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20lynx\"&gt;Balkan lynx&lt;/a&gt; persists around the Albanian-Macedonian border, and is the subject of recovery efforts. Its low population leads it to being rarely seen, and it has a reputation for killing livestock despite very few recorded incidents. There are perhaps fewer than 100 spread across North Macedonia and Albania. &lt;a href=\"Brown%20bear\"&gt;Brown bear&lt;/a&gt;s live in mountainous forests in the west of the country. The population numbers about 160-200 individuals, and are part of the &lt;a href=\"Dinaric%20Alps\"&gt;Dinaric&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Pindus\"&gt;Pindos&lt;/a&gt; population. About 70 are found in &lt;a href=\"Mavrovo%20National%20Park\"&gt;Mavrovo National Park&lt;/a&gt;. The population of &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; numbered around 800-1000 as of 2013.\n&lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20otter\"&gt;Eurasian otter&lt;/a&gt;s can be found throughout most waterways, although they are absent from a couple of areas with particularly high levels of pollution. &lt;a href=\"Golden%20jackal\"&gt;Golden jackal&lt;/a&gt;s were considered extinct in the area by the 1960s, but became re-established in forested mountainous areas, especially in the west, during the 21st century. An individual &lt;a href=\"raccoon%20dog\"&gt;raccoon dog&lt;/a&gt;, a species which was introduced to European Russia in the 20th century, was found dead in the north of the country, indicating the species is spreading southwards.\nHerbivores include &lt;a href=\"roe%20deer\"&gt;roe deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chamois\"&gt;chamois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wild%20boar\"&gt;wild boar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"European%20hare\"&gt;European hare&lt;/a&gt;s. European ground squirrels are found on &lt;a href=\"Mokra%20Gora%20%28mountain%29\"&gt;Mount Mokra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"European%20wildcat\"&gt;European wildcat&lt;/a&gt;, Balkan lynx, Eurasian otter, brown bear, European ground squirrel, and Balkan snow vole have strict protection under national legislation, and another 10 mammal species have lesser levels of protection. Three bats, two rodents, and one mustelid are considered threatened under the IUCN Red List.\nAlgae.\nKnowledge of &lt;a href=\"Algae\"&gt;algal&lt;/a&gt; species remains patchy, with inconsistent research and several taxa that remain not fully identified. There are 2095 identified forms of algae, with the vast majority being diatoms. It is thought at least 10% of these are endemic, with at least 194 having been so far identified as such. Most research on algae has taken place in Ohrid and Lake Prespas. Lake Ohrid by itself holds 798 identified taxa, with 158 being endemic to just that lake.\nDiversity and endemism hotspots.\nWithin North Macedonia, there are multiple areas that are likely high in endemism. Lake Ohrid is an extensively studied area, and its diversity is reflected in a high number of endemic species. Lake Prespa lies quite close to Lake Ohrid, and the two lakes are connected hydrologically. While Lake Prespa has fewer species than Lake Ohrid and while the two lakes share similar species compositions, Lake Prespa has its own endemic species and species more closely related to more western water bodies than to Lake Ohrid.\nWithin Lake Ohrid alone there are over 100 insects, 75 flatworms (35 endemic to the lake and nearby waterbodies), 72 gastropods (56 endemic), 52 ostracods (33 endemic), 49 &lt;a href=\"rotifer\"&gt;rotifer&lt;/a&gt;s, 43 Acari, 36 oligochaetes (17 endemic), 36 copepods (six endemic), 31 &lt;a href=\"Cladocera\"&gt;Cladocera&lt;/a&gt; (one endemic), 30 endemic &lt;a href=\"ciliate\"&gt;ciliate&lt;/a&gt;s, 24 leeches (12 endemic), 24 nematodes (three endemic), 14 &lt;a href=\"amoeba\"&gt;amoeba&lt;/a&gt;s, 13 bivalves (two endemic), 10-11 Amphipoda (9 endemic), four isopods (3 endemic), four sponges, and two decapods. The \"&lt;a href=\"Ancylus\"&gt;Ancylus&lt;/a&gt;\" genus species in this lake are monophyletic, likely &lt;a href=\"Speciation\"&gt;evolving&lt;/a&gt; within the lake itself. The same situation is true for leeches from the genus \"Dina\".\nLake Prespa is less well studied, but is known to have at over 100 insects, 90 crustaceans, 60 rotifers, 50 flatworms, 36 molluscs (27 of which are snails), 35 annelids, and three sponges. Seven of these snails are endemic, as well as \"&lt;a href=\"Pisidium\"&gt;Pisidium&lt;/a&gt; maasseni\". \"&lt;a href=\"Radix%20%28gastropod%29\"&gt;Radix&lt;/a&gt;\" snail species in both Ohrid and Lake Prespas are related, and there are endemic species within springs near the &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20of%20Saint%20Naum\"&gt;Monastery of Saint Naum&lt;/a&gt; that are unrelated to the species in the lakes. Lake Dojran has 17 rotifers.\nIt is expected that mountainous areas will also contain a number of endemic species. North Macedonia contains many areas of ice age &lt;a href=\"Refugium%20%28population%20biology%29\"&gt;refugia&lt;/a&gt;, which retain significant plant diversity. Plant endemism and sub-endemism is high around mountainous areas. Mammal diversity is highest in the mountainous west of the country. Caves in the west, especially within the drainage basins of the &lt;a href=\"Radika\"&gt;Radika&lt;/a&gt;, Galichica, Jakupica, and Poreche rivers, are thought to have rates of invertebrate endemism at around 90%. 57 species of &lt;a href=\"stygofauna\"&gt;stygofauna&lt;/a&gt;s are known, including 14 pseudoscorpions, 12 beetles, and 10 isopods have been identified in caves.\nRelationship with people.\nThere is significant interaction between people and wildlife, especially in rural areas. This continues despite rural depopulation, with rural areas decreasing in population by 2.2% from 2005 to 2010. &lt;a href=\"Foraging\"&gt;Foraging&lt;/a&gt; for wild plants is a common activity for people in rural areas. Around 700 plant species are considered medicinal or aromatic, with 220 being considered frequently used. Some fungi and lichens are collected for use and export.\nCarnivores, such as bears, wolves, and lynx, are viewed negatively in some areas. Bears and wolves are known to attack livestock such as sheep, cattle, and goats. In some instances wolves have been reported to hunt up to 38% of sheep flocks, and an even higher percentage of goats. Foxes and wild cats are reported to kill poultry. There are reports of bear, wolf, and even lynx and jackal attacks on humans, although none of these attacks resulted in deaths. Such conflict may decrease given the number of sheep in the country halved following a 1996 &lt;a href=\"foot-and-mouth%20disease\"&gt;foot-and-mouth disease&lt;/a&gt; outbreak and a resultant drop in the value of sheep products. Additionally, bears and wild boars are known to damage agricultural produce.\n&lt;a href=\"Poaching\"&gt;Poaching&lt;/a&gt; is an issue in some areas, with traps and poison used to catch animals such as wild boar. Poaching increased after &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20%28North%20Macedonia%29\"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt;, due to perceived high fees for hunting within one of the 249 hunting grounds, and a lack of punishment, despite poaching a lynx theoretically being punishable by eight years in jail. Wolf hunting is legal. As they are considered pests, the government pays a bounty of 700 &lt;a href=\"Macedonian%20denar\"&gt;denar&lt;/a&gt; per wolf killed. Between 100 and 200 wolves are killed per year, mostly through chance encounters during the hunting of other animals. Brown bears are still sometimes poached, and while hunting them was banned in 1996, their population has not increased significantly since then. Poaching has also caused a decline in the chamois population.\nSome species have cultural relevance. The lynx is was included on a denar coin. Storks are considered to bring luck in local folklore, especially with regard to child-bearing.\nThreats.\nData deficiency is a significant issue for assessing environmental threats. For example, knowledge about &lt;a href=\"invasive%20species\"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt; in lacking. The invasive species that are relatively well studied are often those that directly affect commercial resources, such as the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20potato%20beetle\"&gt;Colorado potato beetle&lt;/a&gt; affecting crops and the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20carp\"&gt;Prussian carp&lt;/a&gt; reducing native fish populations in Lake Dojran.\nMarsh draining, agricultural &lt;a href=\"land%20use\"&gt;land use&lt;/a&gt; change, and mining have significantly altered the landscape. Hydropower dams have been placed in gorges that host rare and endemic plants. \"&lt;a href=\"Lysimachia%20thyrsiflora\"&gt;Lysimachia thyrsiflora&lt;/a&gt;\" became locally extinct due to the creation of &lt;a href=\"Mavrovo%20Lake\"&gt;Mavrovo Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Dams in the Black Drim have blocked eel migration to the &lt;a href=\"Sargasso%20Sea\"&gt;Sargasso Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Smaller watercourses are at risk of diversion and depletion due to demand for irrigation.\n&lt;a href=\"Water%20pollution\"&gt;Water pollution&lt;/a&gt; remains an issue. The most polluted river, the Vardar, is polluted by around 120\u00a0million cubic metres of waste annually, including 75000 tons of solid particles, 5000 tons of &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt;, and 1000 tons of &lt;a href=\"phosphorus\"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Marsh\"&gt;Marsh&lt;/a&gt;es are a habitat under considerable threat, not just from land use changes but from climate change, and lowland marshes may disappear completely from the country. This wetland conversion is threatening local plant species. In addition to water pollution and water flow modification, fish are threatened by illegal fishing and the invasive species. On land, many plant species are threatened by over-harvesting. \"&lt;a href=\"Gentiana%20lutea\"&gt;Gentiana lutea&lt;/a&gt;\" is low in number due to over-collection for medical purposes. &lt;a href=\"Illegal%20logging\"&gt;Illegal logging&lt;/a&gt; is also a threat, reducing the habitat of animals such as lynx.\nConservation.\nOf the 22,500 species that occur in the country, over 800 are considered to be endemic. Assessing endemism can be tricky, and often species are considered endemic even if a small amount of the population lies outside North Macedonia's borders. For examples, species found only in the three major lakes are considered endemic, despite the lakes being shared with neighbouring countries.\nNorth Macedonia contains 33 pan-European habitat types regarded as endangered under the &lt;a href=\"Berne%20Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20European%20Wildlife%20and%20Natural%20Habitats\"&gt;Bern Convention&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20network\"&gt;Emerald network&lt;/a&gt;. The network covers 35 areas encompassing 29% of the country. The same network includes 167 species that require specific conservation measures: 7 invertebrates, 13 fish, 3 amphibians, 7 reptiles, 115 birds, 17 mammals, and 5 plants.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Politics%20of%20North%20Macedonia%23Executive%20branch\"&gt;Government of North Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; has classified threats to biological diversity into 249 items, 17 of which were considered to have a very high priority. The root causes behind these 17 priority threats include poor policymaking, inconsistent enforcement of laws and regulations, poverty, low public awareness, and &lt;a href=\"climate%20change\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;. An assessment of the threat of climate change identified 18 vulnerable habitats, along with 58 vulnerable plant species and 224 vulnerable animal species.\n65 bird species are listed under the European Union's &lt;a href=\"Birds%20Directive\"&gt;Birds Directive&lt;/a&gt; Annex I, while 15 migratory bird species are listed under Annex I of the &lt;a href=\"Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Migratory%20Species%20of%20Wild%20Animals\"&gt;Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals&lt;/a&gt;. 24 reptiles are listed in the Bern Convention and 25 in the European Union Habitats directive appendices. Eight amphibian species are protected by law, while also falling under the Bern Convention and European Union Habitats directive. 34 fish species have protection under Macedonian law.\nThe &lt;a href=\"BirdLife%20International\"&gt;BirdLife International&lt;/a&gt; has identified 24 Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, while &lt;a href=\"Plantlife%20International\"&gt;Plantlife International&lt;/a&gt; has identified 42 Important Plant Areas.\nThe Vulture Conservation Project has been operated by the Macedonian Ecological Society since 2003. The &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20Lynx%20Recovery%20Programme\"&gt;Balkan Lynx Recovery Programme&lt;/a&gt; (or Programme for Balkan Lynx Recovery) began in 2006.\nSpecies that have increased in number from low bases of local extirpation include \"&lt;a href=\"Gentiana%20pneumonanthe\"&gt;Gentiana pneumonanthe&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Ranunculus%20lingua\"&gt;Ranunculus lingua&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Salvinia%20natans\"&gt;Salvinia natans&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Nuphar%20lutea\"&gt;Nuphar lutea&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Menyanthes\"&gt;Menyanthes trifoliata&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFrom 2007 to 2014, the Government allocated between 4 and 9\u00a0million denar each year for environmental protection. However, most funding comes from external bodies, such as the &lt;a href=\"Global%20Environment%20Facility\"&gt;Global Environment Facility&lt;/a&gt;, the European Union (including pre-accession assistance), and bilateral contributions. Cross-border projects exist with Albania, Bulgaria, and Greece.\nLegal framework.\nEnvironmental protection became part of national law for the first time in 1963, under Article 32 of the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia\"&gt;Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;. This was maintained in the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20North%20Macedonia\"&gt;1991 Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; under Article 56. The constitution even obliges citizens to promote and protect the environment under Article 43 paragraph 2.\nMost environmental laws are set at a national level, with &lt;a href=\"Assembly%20of%20North%20Macedonia\"&gt;Assembly of North Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; having a commission for transport, communications, and environment, which plays a significant role in environmental legislation. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Environment%20and%20Physical%20Planning\"&gt;Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning&lt;/a&gt; (MoEPP) handles government implementation of laws and regulations. In 2007, the Administration of Environment was established within the MoEPP. In 2014 the State Inspectorate of Environment and Nature became a separate legal entity within the MoEPP. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Agriculture%2C%20Forestry%2C%20and%20Water%20Economy\"&gt;Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Economy&lt;/a&gt; also plays a role in ensuring the environment is utilised sustainably.\nThe country is working to integrate &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; environmental legislation into its national laws, and to meet the Aichi targets. IUCN Red List classification and methodology is specifically referenced by the Law on Nature Protection of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette\" no. 67/04, as amended).\nWhile the MoEPP is responsible for nature protecting and monitoring, natural resources, such as forests, waters, and &lt;a href=\"Game%20%28hunting%29\"&gt;game animals&lt;/a&gt; remain under the jurisdiction of other ministries. This overlap in jurisdiction has complicated ecosystem management, and the implementation of the European Union &lt;a href=\"Acquis%20communautaire\"&gt;Acquis communautaire&lt;/a&gt; into North Macedonian Law. Different aspects of environmental monitoring is carried out by a number of different ministries. However, the development of a biodiversity strategy was an early example of effective cooperation between ministries.\nThe Law on Protection of Ohrid, Prespa and Lake Dojrans has provided specific protection for the three large lakes since 1977. The Law on Environment and Nature Protection and Promotion was instituted in 1996.\nThe Law on Nature Protection was established in 2004 to consolidate previous laws, such as the Law on Natural Rarities (1973) and the Law on Protection of Ohrid, Prespa and Lake Dojrans (1977), and the Law on Protection of National Parks (1980). It also transposes parts of the Acquis communautaire, namely the &lt;a href=\"Habitats%20Directive\"&gt;Habitats Directive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Birds%20Directive\"&gt;Birds Directive&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Regulation%20on%20the%20Protection%20of%20Species%20of%20Wild%20Fauna%20and%20Flora%20by%20Regulating%20Trade%20Therein\"&gt;Regulation on the Protection of Species of Wild Fauna and Flora by Regulating Trade Therein&lt;/a&gt;. Use of natural resources such as wild plants and animal parts is regulated under the Law on Nature Protection. National parks issue permits for the collection of wild resources from their forests. This law also legislates to protect the environment from invasive species.\nForests are regulated under the Spatial Plan of the Republic of Macedonia (2004), the Strategy for Sustainable Forestry Development in the Republic of Macedonia (2006), the Law on Reproductive Material of Forest Tree Species (2007), and the Law on Forests (2009). Species important for agriculture have their own protection under Article 78 of the Law on Agriculture and Rural Development. 2666 samples from 89 species were stored in a dedicated Gene Bank at the &lt;a href=\"Faculty%20of%20Agricultural%20Science%20and%20Food%20in%20Skopje\"&gt;Institute of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; as of 2013. This seed bank is regulated under the Law on Seeds and Seedlings. The government is considering establishing a gene bank for native flora, after a previous attempt at Botanical Garden of the Institute of Biology at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, &lt;a href=\"Ss.%20Cyril%20and%20Methodius%20University%20of%20Skopje\"&gt;Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje&lt;/a&gt;, ended after one year.\nThe Law on Waters transfers the European Union &lt;a href=\"Water%20Framework%20Directive\"&gt;Water Framework Directive&lt;/a&gt; into national law, and directs management of waters, shorelands, and wetlands. Other laws relevant to water management include the Law on Water Management Companies and the Law on Water Communities. The Government has published a National Strategy for Waters to guide its actions, and is preparing specific action plans for various lakes and river systems. &lt;a href=\"Commercial%20fishing\"&gt;Commercial fishing&lt;/a&gt; is regulated under the Law on Fishery and Aquaculture. A transbounary plan for fisheries management in Lake Prespa is under development. A joint management plan is being put in place for Lake Ohrid.\nThe first National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan was adopted in 2004, alongside the Law on Nature Protection. Only 56% of its proposed actions were implemented. The 2018-2023 National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan was adopted on 13 March 2020 during the Government's 58th session, and contains 19 specific targets. It is working to develop a Biodiversity Action Plan. Another current plan is the National Strategy for Nature Protection for 2017\u20132027. The first National Environment Action Plan was put in place in 2006. It and the subsequent Second National Environmental Action Plans direct the Government's anti-&lt;a href=\"pollution\"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; efforts.\n&lt;a href=\"Pelister%20National%20Park\"&gt;Pelister National Park&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1948, was the first &lt;a href=\"national%20park\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mavrovo%20National%20Park\"&gt;Mavrovo National Park&lt;/a&gt; followed in 1949, and Mount &lt;a href=\"Gali%C4%8Dica\"&gt;Gali\u010dica&lt;/a&gt; became the third national park in 1958. The Law on Protection of National Parks was implemented in 1980. Other protected areas include \"National Monuments\" (&lt;a href=\"Smolare%20Falls\"&gt;Smolare Falls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Markovi%20Kuli\"&gt;Markovi Kuli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kuklica\"&gt;Kuklica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lovki-Golemo\"&gt;Lovki-Golemo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slatinski%20Izvor\"&gt;Slatinski Izvor&lt;/a&gt; cave, Lake Prespa, Lake Dojran, and the &lt;a href=\"Vevchani%20Springs\"&gt;Vevchani Springs&lt;/a&gt;), \"Strict Nature Reserves\" (only &lt;a href=\"Ploche%20Litotelmi\"&gt;Ploche Litotelmi&lt;/a&gt;), \"Nature Parks\" (&lt;a href=\"Ezerani\"&gt;Ezerani&lt;/a&gt; at Lake Prespa), and \"Natural Rarities\" (&lt;a href=\"Dona%20Duka\"&gt;Dona Duka&lt;/a&gt; Cave). Individual species can also be declared natural rarities, and this status has been granted to the &lt;a href=\"Platanus%20orientalis\"&gt;Sycamore tree&lt;/a&gt;. Protected areas have been established in an ad hoc manner, and for a variety of purposes, resulting in no coherent network or strategy. The Law on Nature Protection divided them into six categories. Altogether, the 86 protected sites cover 230,083 ha, or 8.9% of the country (4.5% national parks, 3.0% monuments, 1.4% other protected areas). The &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20national%20parks%20in%20North%20Macedonia\"&gt;three national parks&lt;/a&gt; have established management systems, but other protected areas lack plans and scientific studies.\nThere are two classes of protected species under North Macedonian law, \"Strictly Protected\" and \"Protected\". National protection measures exist for \"Strictly Protected\" species, but not yet for species identified as \"Protected\". Legislation has been enacted to control the trade of wildlife and wildlife parts.\nThe Constitution treats game animals as &lt;a href=\"Common%20good%20%28economics%29\"&gt;common goods&lt;/a&gt;, and are given special protection. Current regulation is established under the 2012 Law on Hunting. 133 wild species are classified as game, consisting of 110 birds and 23 mammals. There are 112 hunting grounds for large game, and 144 for small game. These are all divided between 11 hunting management areas under the General Hunting Management Master Plan. The most hunted species include hares, &lt;a href=\"partridge\"&gt;partridge&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pheasant\"&gt;pheasant&lt;/a&gt;s, wild boar, and chamois. Previously unprotected, bears were classified as a game species in 1988, gaining hunting law protections in 1996. 762 wolves, 76 deer, 521 chamois, over 6000 wild boar, over 32,000 rabbits, 252 birds of prey, and 1500 waterfowl were recorded as having been shot between 2003 and 2012. A few hunted species have seen steep reductions in their population. Some deer populations have been reduced by up to 93%. The legal list of protected and strictly protected species has not kept up to date with taxonomy, for example by double-counting species which had previously been assigned multiple names.\nInternational conventions.\nNorth Macedonia ratified the &lt;a href=\"Convention%20on%20Biological%20Diversity\"&gt;Convention on Biological Diversity&lt;/a&gt; in 1997, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change\"&gt;United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; in 1997, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Convention%20to%20Combat%20Desertification\"&gt;United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, and the &lt;a href=\"Kyoto%20Protocol\"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. North Macedonia is also a party to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, along with the specific &lt;a href=\"Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Populations%20of%20European%20Bats\"&gt;Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20African-Eurasian%20Migratory%20Waterbirds\"&gt;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo areas totalling have been designated wetlands of international importance under the &lt;a href=\"Ramsar%20Convention\"&gt;Ramsar Convention&lt;/a&gt;: Lake Prespa in 1995 and Dorjan Lake in 2007. However, there is currently no national programme for wetlands conservation, despite obligations under the convention. Lake Ohrid was designated a UNESCO &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site%23Natural\"&gt;criteria for nature&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. Slatinski Izvor cave and the Markovi Kuli landscape were &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20North%20Macedonia%23Tentative%20list\"&gt;tentatively enrolled&lt;/a&gt; in 2004."
