One of the images got stuck on the location where it was placed after which a temple was built at that location, by Ramnath Bhaduri, the Diwan of &lt;a href=\"Murshidabad%20district\"&gt;Murshidabad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nawabs%20of%20Bengal%20and%20Murshidabad\"&gt;Nawab&lt;/a&gt; Muhhammad-Ul- Zaman Khan in the year 1754.
