    "text": "Albert Vaguet (15 June 1865 \u2013 22 February 1943) was a French &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; singer (tenor).\nYouth.\nVaguet was born in &lt;a href=\"Elbeuf\"&gt;Elbeuf&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Seine-Maritime\"&gt;Seine-Maritime&lt;/a&gt;). Very young, he started singing in concerts of his hometown (church and municipal band). He was ten years old when his mother died and to help his father feed his brothers and sisters he worked as a day labourer on the quays of the Seine. He was noticed in 1885 by a journalist from the \"Journal d'Elbeuf\". \nHe entered the &lt;a href=\"Conservatoire%20de%20Paris\"&gt;Conservatoire de Paris&lt;/a&gt; in 1886. The following year, while serving in the 119th infantry regiment of &lt;a href=\"%C3%89vreux\"&gt;\u00c9vreux&lt;/a&gt;, he performed in an exhibition at &lt;a href=\"Le%20Havre\"&gt;Le Havre&lt;/a&gt; where he was nicknamed \"the Military Tenor\" by the local press.\nThe Conservatoire de musique.\nIn 1889 he obtained the first singing and &lt;a href=\"op%C3%A9ra%20comique\"&gt;op\u00e9ra comique&lt;/a&gt; runner-up, and the second opera runner-up in 1889. The following year, he left the Conservatory after winning second prizes in singing, opera and op\u00e9ra comique.\nDespite these second prizes - and against the advice of the critic who reproached him not being able to \"get over an air without giving the flock a nest of ducks\" - Pierre Gailhart, the director of the &lt;a href=\"Op%C3%A9ra%20Garnier\"&gt;Op\u00e9ra Garnier&lt;/a&gt; decided to trust him and engaged him as &lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt;. He then joined the tenors &lt;a href=\"Valentin%20Duc\"&gt;Duc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9on%20Escala%C3%AFs\"&gt;Escala\u00efs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edmond%20Vergnet\"&gt;Vergnet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agustarello%20Affre\"&gt;Affre&lt;/a&gt;, G\u00e9r\u00f4me, T\u00e9qui, Piroia, Voulet, &lt;a href=\"David%20Devri%C3%A8s\"&gt;Devri\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt; and Idrac.\nOp\u00e9ra Garnier.\nAlbert Vaguet performed for the first time on 29 October 1890 at the &lt;a href=\"Palais%20Garnier\"&gt;Palais Garnier&lt;/a&gt; in the role of \"&lt;a href=\"Faust%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Faust&lt;/a&gt;\" by Charles Gounod, a part he held more than 300 times. He played many roles among the works \"&lt;a href=\"Das%20Rheingold\"&gt;Das Rheingold&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Meistersinger%20von%20N%C3%BCrnberg\"&gt;Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg&lt;/a&gt;\" by Wagner, \"&lt;a href=\"Gwendoline%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Gwendoline&lt;/a&gt;\" by Emmanuel Chabrier, \"&lt;a href=\"Tha%C3%AFs%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Tha\u00efs&lt;/a&gt;\" by Jules Massenet, \"&lt;a href=\"Otello\"&gt;Otello&lt;/a&gt;\" by Verdi etc.\nIt was on the occasion of \"D\u00e9idamie\" in 1893 that he met Albertine Marie Chr\u00e9tien, better known by her stage name \"&lt;a href=\"Alba%20Chr%C3%A9tien-Vaguet\"&gt;Alba Chr\u00e9tien&lt;/a&gt;\", born in Paris on 8 March 1872. They married on 30 June 1894 in Paris and had two daughters.\nThey sang at the &lt;a href=\"Orchestre%20de%20la%20Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20des%20Concerts%20du%20Conservatoire\"&gt;Orchestre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts du Conservatoire&lt;/a&gt; and the Opera until 1903 for Albert and 1904 for Alba.\nAfter the Op\u00e9ra.\nThey settled in &lt;a href=\"Nay%2C%20Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques\"&gt;Nay&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Pau%2C%20Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques\"&gt;Pau&lt;/a&gt;, in 1906. Albert, however, continued to record &lt;a href=\"Phonograph%20cylinder\"&gt;cylinders&lt;/a&gt; then &lt;a href=\"78%20rpm\"&gt;78 rpm&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Path%C3%A9%20Records\"&gt;Path\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, and Alba to give singing lessons.\nAlbert and his wife died in Pau on 22 February 1943 and 28 February 1963 respectively.\nEpilogue.\nAlbert Vaguet has recorded many cylinders and records for Path\u00e9. It is not very difficult to obtain them in specialized stores. On the other hand, it is much more complicated to listen to them without damaging the support. Unfortunately, there is no compilation of his performances recorded on a modern medium, with Path\u00e9 still asserting his rights (\"they will expire around 2020\").\nThe master cylinders and discs (the originals held by Path\u00e9) have suffered from inadequate storage conditions and are in fact irreparably altered."
