    "text": "The \"Royal Air Force March Past\" is the official &lt;a href=\"march%20%28music%29\"&gt;march&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (RAF) and is used in some other &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; air forces.\nThe original score was completed by &lt;a href=\"Walford%20Davies\"&gt;Walford Davies&lt;/a&gt; in 1918 for the new RAF. It combined the rhythm of the &lt;a href=\"bugle%20call\"&gt;bugle call&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Flying%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Flying Corps&lt;/a&gt; with that of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service\"&gt;Royal Naval Air Service&lt;/a&gt;. The call appears in both the introduction and the &lt;a href=\"coda%20%28music%29\"&gt;coda&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally known as the Adastral I (in reference to the &lt;a href=\"Per%20ardua%20ad%20astra\"&gt;RAF's motto&lt;/a&gt;). The second part of the march past, the &lt;a href=\"march%20%28music%29%23The%20March%20Music%20Form\"&gt;trio&lt;/a&gt;, was composed by &lt;a href=\"George%20Dyson%20%28composer%29\"&gt;Sir George Dyson&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe march can be played both as a slow march and a quick march, and has been used as both when the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Colour%20Squadron\"&gt;Queen's Colour Squadron&lt;/a&gt; and RAF bands perform public duties such as mounting the guard at &lt;a href=\"Buckingham%20Palace\"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nCanadian version.\nAuthority was granted in February 1943 by &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Public%20Sector%20Information\"&gt;His Majesty's Stationery Office&lt;/a&gt; to publish the \"RAF March Past\" piece in Canada under the title \"RCAF March Past\". It was the official march of the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Canadian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; until the unification of the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Forces\"&gt;Canadian Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; in 1968. It continued to be the authorized march of &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Forces%20Air%20Command\"&gt;Air Command&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Operations%20Branch\"&gt;Air Operations Branch&lt;/a&gt; of the Canadian Forces from 1968-2011. In 2011 Air Command reverted its name to &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Canadian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and the RCAF March Past continues as the official march of the RCAF. It is also the official march of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Cadets\"&gt;Royal Canadian Air Cadets&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Force%20Association%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Air Force Association of Canada&lt;/a&gt;.\nA pipe band arrangement was composed in the 1950s by &lt;a href=\"Pipe%20Major\"&gt;Pipe Major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Howie\"&gt;Alex Howie&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"CFB%20Trenton\"&gt;CFB Trenton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pipe%20Band\"&gt;Pipe Band&lt;/a&gt;, and a trio for pipes was composed in 1970 by Pipe Major &lt;a href=\"Archie%20Cairns\"&gt;Archie Cairns&lt;/a&gt;.\nLyrics.\nThe following are the lyrics to be sung to the Trio section of the march (composed by George Dyson). It references the &lt;a href=\"motto\"&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt; of the RAF, \"\"&lt;a href=\"Per%20Ardua%20Ad%20Astra\"&gt;Per Ardua Ad Astra&lt;/a&gt;\"\" (&lt;a href=\"Latin%20language\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;, \"Through adversity to the stars\")."
