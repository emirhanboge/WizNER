    "text": "Scadoxus cyrtanthiflorus is a herbaceous plant &lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Rwenzori%20Mountains\"&gt;Rwenzori Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of east tropical Africa. Unusually for the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Scadoxus\"&gt;Scadoxus&lt;/a&gt;\" its tubular blooms are pendant. It is sometimes grown as an &lt;a href=\"ornamental%20plant\"&gt;ornamental plant&lt;/a&gt; in heated greenhouses.\nDescription.\n\"Scadoxus cyrtanthiflorus\" is a &lt;a href=\"herbaceous%20plant\"&gt;herbaceous plant&lt;/a&gt; growing from a relatively long &lt;a href=\"rhizome\"&gt;rhizome&lt;/a&gt;. The bases of the leaves (&lt;a href=\"Petiole%20%28botany%29\"&gt;petiole&lt;/a&gt;s) are tightly wrapped to form a pseudostem or false stem up to long. The blade of the leaf is elongated, lanceolate in shape. The flowers and leaves appear together. The flowers are borne in an &lt;a href=\"umbel\"&gt;umbel&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Scape%20%28botany%29\"&gt;scape&lt;/a&gt; (leafless stem) long; the whole plant is up to tall. The flower bud begins growth inside the pseudostem but soon breaks through it to appear at the side. The &lt;a href=\"bract\"&gt;bract&lt;/a&gt;s underneath the umbel soon wither.\nThe umbel is made up of 10\u201325 individual flowers, each on a long &lt;a href=\"Pedicel%20%28botany%29\"&gt;pedicel&lt;/a&gt; (flower stalk). The flowers are directed downwards, unusually for the genus (only \"&lt;a href=\"Scadoxus%20nutans\"&gt;Scadoxus nutans&lt;/a&gt;\" shares this characteristic, but in this case the scape bends over). The colour of the flowers varies from a greenish tube, long, formed by the fused bases of the &lt;a href=\"tepal\"&gt;tepal&lt;/a&gt;s, through white to salmon pink or scarlet at their long free tips. The filaments of the &lt;a href=\"stamen\"&gt;stamen&lt;/a&gt;s are flattened and do not protrude from the flowers (another difference from most other species of \"Scadoxus\"). The fruit is a &lt;a href=\"Berry%20%28botany%29\"&gt;berry&lt;/a&gt;, across.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Scadoxus cyrtanthiflorus\" was first collected in 1895 by the South African botanist &lt;a href=\"George%20F.%20Scott-Elliott\"&gt;George F. Scott-Elliott&lt;/a&gt;. However, his specimen was poorly preserved and it was based on a later collection that &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Henry%20Wright\"&gt;Charles Henry Wright&lt;/a&gt; described and named the species as \"Haemanthus cyrtanthiflorus\" in 1906. The specific epithet \"cyrtanthiflorus\" means \"flowers like \"&lt;a href=\"Cyrtanthus\"&gt;Cyrtanthus&lt;/a&gt;\"\".\n\"Scadoxus\" was originally separated from \"Haemanthus\" by &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20Samuel%20Rafinesque\"&gt;Constantine Samuel Rafinesque&lt;/a&gt; in 1838, when he moved \"Haemanthus multiflorus\" to \"Scadoxus multiflorus\". This separation was ignored by most workers until 1976, when \"Scadoxus\" was again segregated from \"Haemanthus\" by Friis and Nordal. \"Haemanthus\" species are southern in distribution, form true &lt;a href=\"bulb\"&gt;bulb&lt;/a&gt;s and have 2\"n\" = 16 &lt;a href=\"chromosome\"&gt;chromosome&lt;/a&gt;s, whereas \"Scadoxus\" species, such as \"S.\u00a0cyrtanthiflorus\", are found throughout tropical Africa, do not all form bulbs and have 2\"n\" = 18 chromosomes.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Scadoxus cyrtanthiflorus\" is endemic to the &lt;a href=\"Rwenzori%20Mountains\"&gt;Rwenzori Mountains&lt;/a&gt; on the border between &lt;a href=\"Uganda\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;. It grows at altitudes of between , but is mostly found at around . Plants normally grow in constantly moist, shady habitats in forest undergrowth, either in the ground in highly organic soils, as &lt;a href=\"epiphyte\"&gt;epiphyte&lt;/a&gt;s on tree trunks or on rocks and boulders.\nCultivation.\nIn 2004, \"S. cyrtanthiflorus\" was said to be unknown in cultivation, although in 1928 it had received an &lt;a href=\"Award%20of%20Garden%20Merit\"&gt;RHS Award of Merit&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014, it was among those described as \"becoming more widely grown.\" In cultivation, \"S. cyrtanthiflorus\" is said to grow \"well, if quite slowly, with most growth being in spring and autumn.\" The recommended potting medium is a very open organic mix, as would be used for orchids. Pests are those of &lt;a href=\"Scadoxus%23Cultivation\"&gt;\"Scadoxus\" generally&lt;/a&gt;.\nToxicity.\nThe genus \"Scadoxus\" is known to have some strongly toxic species, containing poisonous &lt;a href=\"alkaloid\"&gt;alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;s. These are lethal to animals, such as sheep and goats, that graze on the plants. Other species of \"Scadoxus\" have been used in parts of tropical Africa as components of &lt;a href=\"arrow%20poison\"&gt;arrow poison&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Fish%20toxins\"&gt;fishing poison&lt;/a&gt;s."
