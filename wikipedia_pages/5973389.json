    "text": "McHale's Navy is a 1997 American military &lt;a href=\"comedy%20film\"&gt;comedy film&lt;/a&gt; starring &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Arnold%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Tom Arnold&lt;/a&gt;. It is based on the 1962-1966 &lt;a href=\"McHale%27s%20Navy\"&gt;television series&lt;/a&gt; of the same title. &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Borgnine\"&gt;Ernest Borgnine&lt;/a&gt; was the only member of the original television show's cast to appear in the film.\nPlot.\nOn the Island of San Moreno, a trio of important-looking men (a Chinese militant, a Russian General, and a European businessman) are meeting with the island's governor. After paying him a suitcase full of money for a special operation, the three men are joined, via helicopter, by Major Jake McPherson Vladakov (&lt;a href=\"Tim%20Curry\"&gt;Tim Curry&lt;/a&gt;), the second best &lt;a href=\"terrorist\"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; in the world, who will oversee the operation. This entire event is witnessed by a young boy named Roberto who takes pictures of the governor, the Major, and his men.\nThe next morning finds retired &lt;a href=\"Lt.%20Commander\"&gt;Lt. Commander&lt;/a&gt; Quinton McHale (&lt;a href=\"Tom%20Arnold%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Tom Arnold&lt;/a&gt;) making his way to the Naval base of San Ysidro, where he does some trading with the officers. Such goods and services include selling home-brewed beer, ice cream, and swimsuit calendars to the men of the San Ysidro &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Base\"&gt;Naval Base&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for things like medicine and satellite photos to help the people of San Moreno. The satellite photos are his way of spying on the opposing children's baseball team. Stationed at the base are his old crew: Virgil (&lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Campbell\"&gt;Bruce Campbell&lt;/a&gt;), a cigar-chomping ladies' man and gunner; Happy (&lt;a href=\"French%20Stewart\"&gt;French Stewart&lt;/a&gt;), the team lookout who lives in a treehouse; Willie (&lt;a href=\"Henry%20Cho\"&gt;Henry Cho&lt;/a&gt;), the team techie and moonshine maker; Gruber (&lt;a href=\"Danton%20Stone\"&gt;Danton Stone&lt;/a&gt;), a slightly portly card-player and cigar hoarder; and Christy (&lt;a href=\"Brian%20Haley\"&gt;Brian Haley&lt;/a&gt;), the group's musclehead who can unscrew a bottle cap with his eye.\nHowever, Captain Wallace B. Binghamton (&lt;a href=\"Dean%20Stockwell\"&gt;Dean Stockwell&lt;/a&gt;) and Lieutenant Penelope Carpenter (&lt;a href=\"Debra%20Messing\"&gt;Debra Messing&lt;/a&gt;) command the base now. Capt. Binghamton believes his men have &lt;a href=\"wikt%3ASpecial%3ASearch/go%20native\"&gt;gone native&lt;/a&gt; and confiscates all the products McHale has sold them. He wants to resurrect his career after having mistakenly sunk a luxury cruise liner, for which he is famously known.\nVladakov takes control of the baseball field and beach on San Moreno to set up his base of operations. After Roberto inadvertently alerts Vladakov to McHale's presence, (mostly thanks to the jersey that McHale gave him and the team), Vladakov uses his new &lt;a href=\"stealth%20ship\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; boat to blow up McHale's home and nearly destroys his PT-73, a decommissioned &lt;a href=\"PT%20Boat\"&gt;PT Boat&lt;/a&gt;, which reveals that they have a bad history with each other. When the governor tells Vladakov that his operations are disrupting the lives of the villagers, Vladakov and his men invade the village during their fiesta, blowing it up, and displacing everyone that lived there.\nAt the Pentagon, Cobra (&lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Borgnine\"&gt;Ernest Borgnine&lt;/a&gt;), an admiral, finds out about Vladakov's presence on San Moreno and instructs Binghamton to stand down in favor of McHale, revealing that he was once a highly decorated, top covert operative. This shocks Binghamton, but he relays the message to McHale. McHale rejects the mission, saying he wants nothing to do with it, or with Binghamton. Upon learning that the village was destroyed, McHale accepts the assignment with the stipulations that he be given his old crew, men stationed at San Ysidro, and complete autonomy from Binghamton. Binghamton appears to agree but enlists &lt;a href=\"Ensign%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Ensign&lt;/a&gt; Charles Parker (&lt;a href=\"David%20Alan%20Grier\"&gt;David Alan Grier&lt;/a&gt;) to spy on McHale. Slowly both Parker and Carpenter realize that Binghamton is an incompetent officer.\nMcHale sets up a camp site for the villagers and, after invading Vladakov's base to find out what's going on, heads to &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; for supplies to fix the re-commissioned PT-73 and to combat Vladakov. McHale and his crew use a &lt;a href=\"pirated\"&gt;pirated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"variety%20show\"&gt;variety show&lt;/a&gt; broadcast to prevent Vladakov from stealing missile launch codes and entertain the villagers. Binghamton, tired of sitting on the side lines, attempts an attack on Vladakov's base but upon arrival, it is vacated and shown to be a front. Vladakov has killed the men that hired him to blow up The Pentagon as his motives are finally revealed. He was monitoring communications between McHale and Cobra and is aware that Cobra is en route to San Moreno to help take out Vladakov.\nVladakov attempts to kill Cobra using his stealth boat. Roberto is aboard and he tries to short out the boat to no avail. He is captured by Vladakov, but manages to jump ship. After Ensign Parker saves Roberto, McHale successfully kills Vladakov using a torpedo he bought in Cuba, as revenge for Vladakov killing Roberto's father in Panama. Cobra lands safely and reveals that he is McHale's father, none other than now &lt;a href=\"Admiral\"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt; Quinton McHale, Sr. and former WWII era commander of the PT-73.\nFinally, the film ends with the commendations of McHale's crew, and the promotions of Lt. Carpenter and Ensign Parker, the US Navy rebuilding the baseball field, McHale re-retiring so that he may pursue a relationship with Carpenter, and Binghamton's apparent demotion to umpire for a kids' baseball game.\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe film earned $2,128,565, ranking 7th place at the box office in its opening weekend. Its final total came to $4,529,843, against a production budget of $42 million.\n&lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Sheinberg\"&gt;Sidney Sheinberg&lt;/a&gt;, whose production company &lt;a href=\"The%20Bubble%20Factory\"&gt;The Bubble Factory&lt;/a&gt; produced the film for Universal, said: \"\"McHale\u2019s Navy\" was a disaster. I'm not pretending it wasn\u2019t a disaster\".\nCritical response.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Tomatoes\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, the film holds an approval rating of 3% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 2.01/10 and the consensus: \"About as funny as a keelhauling, \"McHale's Navy\" will leave most viewers feeling they've been the victim of a particularly dishonorable discharge.\" &lt;a href=\"Metacritic\"&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt; reports a weighted average score of 18 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". Audiences surveyed by &lt;a href=\"CinemaScore\"&gt;CinemaScore&lt;/a&gt; gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on scale of A to F.\n&lt;a href=\"Mick%20LaSalle\"&gt;Mick LaSalle&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Chronicle\"&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote in a very negative review: \"By the end, this soporific comedy makes 105 minutes feel more like a two-year hitch.\"\nLeonard Klady of &lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt; wrote: \"Time and adapters have not been kind to the fun-loving series.\"\nAwards.\n\"McHale's Navy\" was nominated for a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Raspberry%20Awards\"&gt;Razzie Award&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Raspberry%20Award%20for%20Worst%20Prequel%2C%20Remake%2C%20Rip-off%20or%20Sequel\"&gt;Worst Remake or Sequel&lt;/a&gt;, losing to \"\". It won the awards for Worst Actor (Arnold) and Worst Resurrection of a TV Show at the &lt;a href=\"1997%20Stinkers%20Bad%20Movie%20Awards\"&gt;1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards&lt;/a&gt;."
