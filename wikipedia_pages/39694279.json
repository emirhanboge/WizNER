    "text": "The Yumiko-chan incident was the &lt;a href=\"rape\"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"murder\"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; of six-year-old &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese girl Yumiko Nagayama (sometimes reported as Yumiko Arakaki) by &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; soldier Sergeant Isaac J. Hurt in &lt;a href=\"Kadena%2C%20Okinawa\"&gt;Kadena, Okinawa&lt;/a&gt; on 3 September 1955. Nagayama's body was found near &lt;a href=\"Kadena%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Kadena Air Base&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Civil%20Administration%20of%20the%20Ryukyu%20Islands\"&gt;U.S. occupation of Okinawa&lt;/a&gt;, and an investigation led to the conviction of 31-year-old Sergeant Hurt on charges of murder, rape, and kidnapping. The Yumiko-chan Incident caused &lt;a href=\"anti-American\"&gt;anti-American&lt;/a&gt; outrage in Okinawa and contributed to the first major Okinawan protests against the U.S. occupation and military presence.\nIncident.\nOn 4 September 1955, the &lt;a href=\"mutilated\"&gt;mutilated&lt;/a&gt; body of a young girl was discovered in a &lt;a href=\"landfill\"&gt;landfill&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Kadena%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Kadena Air Base&lt;/a&gt;, an installation of the &lt;a href=\"Far%20East%20Command%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Far East Command&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kadena%2C%20Okinawa\"&gt;Kadena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Okinawa\"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt;, at the time governed by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Civil%20Administration%20of%20the%20Ryukyu%20Islands\"&gt;United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands&lt;/a&gt;. The girl was found to have been &lt;a href=\"rape\"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt;d and her body was described as if it had \"been cut up with a sharp knife from the &lt;a href=\"abdominal\"&gt;abdominal&lt;/a&gt; region to the &lt;a href=\"bowel\"&gt;bowel&lt;/a&gt;\". The girl was identified as Yumiko Nagayama (sometimes reported as Yumiko Arakaki), a six year-old &lt;a href=\"kindergarten\"&gt;kindergarten&lt;/a&gt; student from &lt;a href=\"Ishikawa%2C%20Okinawa\"&gt;Ishikawa&lt;/a&gt; (now part of the city of &lt;a href=\"Uruma\"&gt;Uruma&lt;/a&gt;) who had been reported missing at about 8 p.m when she did not come home from playing outdoors. When a brown hair was discovered on Nagayama's body, investigators suspected that the perpetrator was foreign, prompting a joint investigation by the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20military\"&gt;U.S. military&lt;/a&gt; and the Ryukyu Police, the civilian police agency in Okinawa at the time. The investigation suggested that Nagayama was abducted at an &lt;a href=\"Eisa%20%28dance%29\"&gt;Eisa&lt;/a&gt; performance where eyewitnesses claimed to have seen her leave with a &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; man, indicating that the perpetrator was a U.S. serviceman. An indictment was submitted against Sergeant Isaac J. Hurt (sometimes incorrectly reported as Isaac J. Hart) of B Battalion, 32nd Artillery Division, on charges of murder, rape and kidnapping. \nReaction.\nNews of Nagayama's violent rape and murder by a U.S. serviceman provoked outrage among Okinawans, who were further angered by the fact that due to &lt;a href=\"extraterritoriality\"&gt;extraterritoriality&lt;/a&gt; laws, Nagayama's alleged rapist and murderer would not undergo an Okinawan trial, but rather a U.S. military &lt;a href=\"courts-martial\"&gt;court-martial&lt;/a&gt;. A Rally for Protection of Children was held in Okinawa and the Association for Protection of Children was formed with this incident, and many Okinawans rallied in support of the cause. Okinawans demanded that the U.S. military \"Punish offenders of this kind of case with the death penalty without leniency regardless of nationality or ethnicity.\" Okinawans demanded that he be tried in a civilian court and that the trial be broadcast, but these requests were declined.\nTrial.\nSergeant Isaac J. Hurt was brought up on charges of rape and murder by a U.S. court-martial in Okinawa. Hurt insisted upon his innocence, but his court martial lasted 13 days and he was convicted after a deliberation of less than an hour, and &lt;a href=\"sentenced%20to%20death\"&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Hurt was the second conviction of a U.S. serviceman on Okinawa for rape in less than a month. Though he was initially sentenced to death by a US court martial, Hurt was returned to the US without the Okinawan public being informed, and his sentence was reduced to 45 years - without the possibility of parole - by &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower\"&gt;President Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt; in 1960.\nRelease from prison.\nFollowing the commutation of his death sentence, Hurt was transferred to &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Penitentiary%2C%20Leavenworth\"&gt;USP Leavenworth&lt;/a&gt; where he suffered a stroke in 1969. He wrote letters to Senators and members of the US government requesting to be granted parole or his case to be dismissed. In one letter, he alleged, \u201cI was sacrificed to appease the dissident political elements who were demanding an end to American mil. [military] Occupation.\u201d\nIn January 1977, &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Ford\"&gt;President Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt; granted Hurt\u2019s requests to be made eligible for parole and, that year, he was released from prison. Following his release, Hurt found work as a night watchman and, in 1981, he got married. On 6 August 1984, he died at the age of 60 at a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs\"&gt;Department of Veterans Affairs&lt;/a&gt; hospital in Ohio State; his grave in Reading Cemetery, &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Hamilton County&lt;/a&gt;, Ohio State, is marked with a headstone, provided by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, noting his service in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;WW2&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nThe Yumiko-chan Incident caused an increase in Okinawan opposition against the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Civil%20Administration%20of%20the%20Ryukyu%20Islands\"&gt;United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands&lt;/a&gt; and ten years of U.S. military occupation in Okinawa, and led to further debate over the continued presence of &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Forces%20Japan\"&gt;U.S. forces in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. It was the springboard for the first serious, coordinated anti-U.S. military protests in Okinawa following the beginning of the occupation in 1945.\nOn September 23, 2021, &lt;a href=\"Okinawa%20Times\"&gt;Okinawa Times&lt;/a&gt; reported about the release of Hurt and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs\"&gt;Department of Veterans' Affairs&lt;/a&gt;' provision of his grave marker, despite his conviction for rape and murder of a minor. Okinawan peace activists, including &lt;a href=\"Suzuyo%20Takazato\"&gt;Suzuyo Takazato&lt;/a&gt;, expressed anger at the release and the US government's decision to supply such a headstone."
