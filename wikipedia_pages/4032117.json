    "text": "The Christa McAuliffe Space Center (known as the McAuliffe Space Center or CMSC), in &lt;a href=\"Pleasant%20Grove%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Pleasant Grove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Utah\"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, teaches school children about &lt;a href=\"Outer%20space\"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; and is visited by students from around the world. It has a number of space &lt;a href=\"flight%20simulators\"&gt;flight simulators&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe center, named for educator &lt;a href=\"Christa%20McAuliffe\"&gt;Christa McAuliffe&lt;/a&gt;, killed in &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger%20disaster\"&gt;\"Challenger\" disaster&lt;/a&gt;, was started in 1990 by Victor Williamson, an educator at &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20School%20District\"&gt;Central Elementary School&lt;/a&gt;. It is a building added onto Central Elementary. It aims to teach &lt;a href=\"astronomy\"&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"social%20studies\"&gt;social studies&lt;/a&gt; through the use of simulators; the first, \"Voyager\", proved itself popular, and a new planetarium built in 2020. As the years passed, the demand for flights expanded and new ships were commissioned. In October 2012, the space center was temporarily closed at Central Elementary, but re-opened following several district-mandated upgrades, closures, and maintenance procedures in Spring 2013. The original simulators, along with the school that housed them, was demolished on May 5, 2020 to make way for a new space center built behind the original property. The new Space Center was built housing the 2nd largest planetarium in the State of Utah that started running shows in November of 2020. The Christa McAuliffe Space Education Center switched its name and took out the word Education from the title in 2018. In 2018, they also updated their logo to a new stylized version of the original. (New version not shown)\nThe simulators employed by the center have included the following (in order of original construction):\nEach simulator has its own plaque. The plaque displays the ship's names and other things about that specific simulator. Some are inside the simulator, and some of them are hidden out of plain sight.\nMost missions are based on, or at least contain aspects similar to the &lt;a href=\"Star%20Trek\"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt; universe. The Simulators themselves are replicas of Star Trek ships and various races (like the Romulans) are often involved in missions.\nThe center, and its founder were honored in a ceremony in its 15th year by many individuals, including &lt;a href=\"Gary%20R.%20Herbert\"&gt;Gary Herbert&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Utah\"&gt;Lieutenant Governor of Utah&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, with its five spaceship simulators, it was educating 16,000 students a year.\nThe center's mission statement is \"A Utah Arts, Sciences, Technology Education Initiative. We Practice the Discipline of Wonder.\"\nTeaching method.\nThe Space Center uses it simulators in order to create interactive stories, usually applicable to historical events, in which the students are involved. Since November of 2020, they also use the planetarium that was built during their 2020 rebuild. \nStudents also learn and apply different aspects of astronomy and science in missions. They get the chance to learn about &lt;a href=\"black%20hole\"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nebula\"&gt;nebula&lt;/a&gt;e, &lt;a href=\"asteroid\"&gt;asteroid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"planetary%20system\"&gt;planetary system&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Natural%20satellite\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;s, and a variety of other phenomena.\nStudents who attended the Space Center 15 years ago are now pursuing fields in &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;, technology, &lt;a href=\"space%20exploration\"&gt;space exploration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Computer%20programming\"&gt;programming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"electrical%20engineering\"&gt;electrical engineering&lt;/a&gt;. Students at the local &lt;a href=\"Brigham%20Young%20University\"&gt;Brigham Young University&lt;/a&gt; have the opportunity to develop consoles and equipment for the Space Center; gadgets such as &lt;a href=\"Tricorder\"&gt;Tricorder&lt;/a&gt;s, touch panel equipment, &lt;a href=\"fiber%20optics\"&gt;fiber optics&lt;/a&gt; systems, ships, and &lt;a href=\"Digital%20data\"&gt;digital&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"analog%20signal\"&gt;analog&lt;/a&gt; control interfaces all help to give a more realistic effect to the experience.\nThe center's staff hopes that its visitors are tomorrow's scientists.\nSimulator Technology.\nThe Space Center employs technologies and equipment to achieve its simulations. In each ship, there is a powerful &lt;a href=\"high%20fidelity\"&gt;sound system&lt;/a&gt; (including a powerful &lt;a href=\"Bass%20%28sound%29\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt; response to simulate the feeling of the &lt;a href=\"reactor%20core\"&gt;reactor core&lt;/a&gt;) hooked up to an industry standard &lt;a href=\"mixing%20board\"&gt;mixing board&lt;/a&gt; which combines input from a combination of sound sources heard through the main speakers, such as, &lt;a href=\"sound%20effect\"&gt;sound effect&lt;/a&gt;s, music, DVD players, &lt;a href=\"CD%20player\"&gt;CD player&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"microphone\"&gt;microphone&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"voice\"&gt;voice&lt;/a&gt; distorters.\nThe &lt;a href=\"video\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; system is just as complex. Each mission available has a story &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; with clips compiled for scenes in a story and other visual effects. These video sources are all controlled by a video switcher so that it appears to be a seamless video. In addition to movie clips, the Space Center also makes its own tactical screens. Tactical screens are in essence complex power points that can be networked to display real time information about the ship. This information may include information about things related to the current story such as ship systems while others may be maps or other mission information. Various programs have been used to create these screens including HyperCard, Runtime Revolution, and Thorium.\nEach simulator is also equipped with a &lt;a href=\"lighting\"&gt;lighting&lt;/a&gt; system allowing both red and white lights to be displayed; red during alerts and white during normal alert levels. Each set of lights is attached to a &lt;a href=\"dimmer\"&gt;dimmer&lt;/a&gt; in the control room allowing the lights to manually &lt;a href=\"fluctuate\"&gt;fluctuate&lt;/a&gt; in different events during a mission, such as a &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; impact or power failure. The most advanced set of lights at the Space Center is installed in the \"Galileo\". The lighting system in the Galileo is capable of being controlled via computer making effects seem more realistic.\nIn order to ensure that campers are safe, a network of &lt;a href=\"closed-circuit%20television\"&gt;closed circuit&lt;/a&gt; cameras is also installed at key points on the set to monitor their positions. Each simulator has part of the bridge and connected areas of the set monitored at all times.\nThe most complex part of each simulator is the &lt;a href=\"computer\"&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt; systems. Each ship has several computers installed. The smallest set, the \"Galileo\", has five, while the largest set, the \"Magellan\", has 13. Each one of these computers (excluding sound effect computers and tactical [main viewer] computers) is connected to a &lt;a href=\"computer%20network\"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; allowing communication between computers. In this way, the programs on each of the computers are also able to communicate with each other, allowing the control room to monitor the simulation and for computers on the bridge to update each other with information sent from the control room. The programming on each of the computers used to be programmed in &lt;a href=\"HyperCard\"&gt;HyperCard&lt;/a&gt;, which was in use on the USS \"Voyager\" until the simulator was decommissioned. Later however, the Space Center switched to Revolution by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.runrev.com\"&gt;Runtime Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. The next generation of programs at the Space Center were programmed in &lt;a href=\"Cocoa%20%28API%29\"&gt;Cocoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Inc.\"&gt;Apple Inc's&lt;/a&gt; own programming language for their &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Macintosh\"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt; computer platform. Since 2018, the space center has used the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//thoriumsim.com\"&gt;Thorium&lt;/a&gt; open-source starship simulator platform, developed by a former volunteer.\nPrivate donations paid for the simulators, while the school district pays the salary of the center's director. 181 volunteers and part-timers help to operate the simulators.\nStaff.\nThe Space Center's full-time employee is the Director. Flight Directors, Set Directors, and Bridge Supervisors are part-time employees. The volunteering organization is divided into guilds and classes of volunteers as follows:\nThe Guilds.\n(Note: All of the classes of Volunteers above except for the regular Volunteers have their own guild.\nPrograms and Camps.\nThe Space Center offers a variety of programs that provide varying mission lengths and experiences. Continuing the educational aim of the Space Center, there are field trip programs for school classes that provide education about science, space and teamwork/leadership. These programs also offer educational experience missions on the simulators. For the general public, there are also private missions, and summer camps. Private missions are available to be reserved in 2 lengths: 2.5 hour and 5 hour missions. These time blocks include time for briefing and training in preparation for the actual mission on the simulator. In Space Center history, they used to have Overnight Camps. Overnight camps used to start on Friday nights and end on the following morning: all missions were 'paused' for the night, campers sleep at the Space Center overnight, and then missions are resumed in the morning. These missions however, are no longer available. They also had Super Saturday camps that provided the same missions as overnight camps, but occurred during the day on Saturdays. The Leadership Camp is made for an older audience of ages 15\u201317. It differs from the other summer camps in the way that the whole camp is a campaign and every mission is part of a bigger picture. This camp may not be flown every summer due to the amount of planning that goes into it since it runs through multiple days. Summer camps usually happen in 1 day with a variety of activities from missions to classroom activities and planetarium shows.
