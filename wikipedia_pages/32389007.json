    "text": "&lt;a href=\"NK%20Maribor\"&gt;Nogometni klub Maribor&lt;/a&gt;, also simply known as NK Maribor, is a Slovenian professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football club&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Maribor\"&gt;Maribor&lt;/a&gt;. The club have participated in 36 editions of the club competitions governed by the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20European%20Football%20Associations\"&gt;Union of European Football Associations&lt;/a&gt; (UEFA), the chief authority for football across Europe. These include 15 seasons in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, 15 seasons in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cup and Europa League&lt;/a&gt;, one season in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa Conference League&lt;/a&gt;, two seasons in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and three seasons in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Counting all of the 171 games the side have played in European competitions since their first entry into the &lt;a href=\"Mitropa%20Cup\"&gt;Mitropa Cup&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1970%E2%80%9371%20Mitropa%20Cup\"&gt;1970\u201371&lt;/a&gt; season, the team's record stands at 63 wins, 41 draws, and 67 defeats as of match played 29 July 2021. The club's most recent participation in a continental competition was in the 2021\u201322 season, when they played in the qualifying rounds of the &lt;a href=\"2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League\"&gt;2021\u201322 UEFA Europa Conference League&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaribor's 10\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"FC%20Norma%20Tallinn\"&gt;Norma Tallinn&lt;/a&gt; of Estonia in the &lt;a href=\"1994%E2%80%9395%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;1994\u201395 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; is the club's most decisive win in European competitions, while the team's heaviest defeat is 9\u20131, against the Dutch club &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1997%E2%80%9398%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1997\u201398 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. With 94 caps, &lt;a href=\"Marcos%20Tavares\"&gt;Marcos Tavares&lt;/a&gt; has appeared in the most UEFA matches for Maribor; Tavares has also scored the most goals with 31.\nAs of the 2021\u201322 season, Maribor is the only Slovenian club that has managed to qualify for the group stages of the UEFA Champions League, and one of five clubs from the former &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; who have participated in the group stages of the competition since the breakup of the country in 1992. Maribor won their only European honour in 2006, when they defeated &lt;a href=\"Villarreal%20CF\"&gt;Villarreal&lt;/a&gt; in the third round of the &lt;a href=\"2006%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;, becoming one of the eleven co-winners of the competition.\nBackground.\nClub competitions between teams from European countries can trace their origins as far back as 1897, when the &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Cup%20%28Austro-Hungarian%20Empire%29\"&gt;Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; was created for clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The &lt;a href=\"Mitropa%20Cup\"&gt;Mitropa Cup&lt;/a&gt;, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927 and played between Central European clubs. The first continental competition organised by &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1955. Established as a competition for winners of the European national football leagues, it is considered the most prestigious European football competition. The European Cup was re-branded in 1992 as the UEFA Champions League. In the 1950s, two further competitions were created: the &lt;a href=\"Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup\"&gt;Inter-Cities Fairs Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Established in 1955, the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was later re-branded as the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; when it came under the auspices of UEFA in 1971. Since the 2009\u201310 season, the competition has been known as the UEFA Europa League. The UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was inaugurated in 1960 for the winners of domestic cup competitions.\nHistory.\nYugoslav period: 1960\u20131991.\nBefore Slovenia's independence in 1991, Maribor competed in the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Yugoslav football league system&lt;/a&gt;. When playing in the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav First League&lt;/a&gt;, Maribor never finished in positions which assured competing in UEFA competitions; the closest they came was in the &lt;a href=\"1969%E2%80%9370%20Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;1969\u201370&lt;/a&gt; season, when they finished tenth. Maribor made its debut in European competitions in the &lt;a href=\"1970%E2%80%9371%20Mitropa%20Cup\"&gt;1970\u201371&lt;/a&gt; season, when it competed in the &lt;a href=\"Mitropa%20Cup\"&gt;Mitropa Cup&lt;/a&gt;, a non-UEFA competition for Central European teams. Maribor were eliminated in the first round by the Austrian side &lt;a href=\"Grazer%20AK\"&gt;Grazer AK&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"away%20goals%20rule\"&gt;away goals rule&lt;/a&gt;, having won 3\u20131 at home and lost 2\u20130 away.\nNew country and UEFA debut: 1992\u20131996.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"breakup%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;breakup of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Football Association of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; established their own competitions. Maribor were the inaugural winners of the &lt;a href=\"Slovenian%20Football%20Cup\"&gt;Slovenian Cup&lt;/a&gt;, where they defeated their &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20derby%20of%20Slovenian%20football%20%281962%E2%80%932004%29\"&gt;biggest rivals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"NK%20Olimpija%20Ljubljana%20%281945%29\"&gt;Olimpija&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1991%E2%80%9392%20Slovenian%20Football%20Cup%23Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;. As the national cup winners, they qualified for the &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;1992\u201393 European Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In the qualifying round, they played against &lt;a href=\"%C4%A6amrun%20Spartans%20F.C.\"&gt;\u0126amrun Spartans&lt;/a&gt; from Malta. The first match was played on 19 August 1992 at &lt;a href=\"Ljudski%20vrt\"&gt;Ljudski vrt&lt;/a&gt;, where Maribor won 4\u20130. This was the first ever match for Maribor in the official UEFA competitions. Fourteen days later they lost the second leg 2\u20131, but still managed to qualify for the first round with an &lt;a href=\"Two-legged%20tie\"&gt;aggregate&lt;/a&gt; score of 5\u20132. In the first round, they were drawn against the Spanish side &lt;a href=\"Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid\"&gt;Atl\u00e9tico Madrid&lt;/a&gt;. Maribor lost the first leg 3\u20130 at the home turf in front of 8,000 spectators, and later suffered a heavy defeat in the second leg in &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, where Atl\u00e9tico won 6\u20131. In the next season, Maribor played in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. They reached the second round, where they were eliminated by &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20Dortmund\"&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt;, 2\u20131 on aggregate. On 25 August 1994, Maribor played a historic game against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Norma%20Tallinn\"&gt;Norma Tallinn&lt;/a&gt; from Estonia in the Cup Winners' Cup. This was the first match at Ljudski vrt under the floodlights, and also the biggest ever victory for Maribor in European competitions (10\u20130). In 1996, Maribor competed in the group stage of the &lt;a href=\"1996%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;1996 UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;. They defeated &lt;a href=\"FK%20Austria%20Wien\"&gt;Austria Wien&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 at home in the first round, but in the next three games, they only managed to get one point, against &lt;a href=\"Keflav%C3%ADk%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Keflav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;. Maribor lost the remaining two matches against two Scandinavian teams, &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Copenhagen\"&gt;K\u00f8benhavn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%96rebro%20SK\"&gt;\u00d6rebro&lt;/a&gt;, and finished in third place with four points.\nChampions League: 1997\u20131999.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20Slovenian%20PrvaLiga\"&gt;1996\u201397&lt;/a&gt; season, Maribor won the national league for the first time. As the Slovenian champions, they started in the second qualifying round of the &lt;a href=\"1997%E2%80%9398%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;1997\u201398 Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, where they eliminated &lt;a href=\"Derry%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Derry City&lt;/a&gt; from Ireland. In the last qualifying round before the group stages, they were drawn against the Turkish side &lt;a href=\"Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F%20J.K.\"&gt;Be\u015fikta\u015f&lt;/a&gt;. Be\u015fikta\u015f did not manage to win the first game at their own ground, as the game ended 0\u20130. However, Maribor lost the home leg 3\u20131 and were eliminated. They continued their European journey in the UEFA Cup, where they were eliminated by &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt;. The first game in Maribor ended with 1\u20131. In the return leg in &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam\"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;, Maribor suffered their heaviest defeat in the European football, as Ajax won the match 9\u20131. In the next season, Maribor came very close to the group stages. After eliminating &lt;a href=\"FK%20Kareda%20Kaunas\"&gt;Kareda \u0160iauliai&lt;/a&gt; in the second qualifying round, they again reached the last qualifying round before the group stages. This time, they were drawn against another Dutch side, &lt;a href=\"PSV%20Eindhoven\"&gt;PSV Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt;. At Ljudski vrt, Peter Breznik scored in the 83rd minute for 2\u20131, and gave Maribor one goal advantage before visiting the &lt;a href=\"Philips%20Stadion\"&gt;Philips Stadion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eindhoven\"&gt;Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt;. In the second leg, &lt;a href=\"Dalibor%20Filipovi%C4%87\"&gt;Dalibor Filipovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; scored in the fifth minute to give Maribor a 1\u20130 lead, but PSV responded immediately and equalised in the ninth minute. PSV scored another goal half an hour before the end, and the match went to &lt;a href=\"Overtime%20%28sports%29\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt;. Maribor eventually lost the game 4\u20132 and were eliminated. Again, they continued in the UEFA Cup, and as in the previous season were eliminated in the first round, this time by &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, losing both games.\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, Maribor finally reached the group stages of the elite UEFA Champions League. They started their European triumph with a 5\u20131 home win against &lt;a href=\"K.R.C.%20Genk\"&gt;Racing Genk&lt;/a&gt; in the second qualifying round. In the second leg in Belgium, Genk were leading 3\u20130 and Maribor were down to ten players as &lt;a href=\"Amir%20Kari%C4%87\"&gt;Amir Kari\u0107&lt;/a&gt; was sent off, but the team managed to hold on and advanced 5\u20134 on aggregate. In the third qualifying round, Maribor faced &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20Lyonnais\"&gt;Olympique Lyonnais&lt;/a&gt;. In the first leg in France, Filipovi\u0107 scored the only goal of the match two minutes before full-time. The demand for tickets for the second leg was so high that dozens of fans waited in line all night in front of the stadium to secure their tickets, as the capacity of the stadium at the time was only 7,500. In the second leg, Maribor defeated the French side 2\u20130, with goals from &lt;a href=\"Ante%20%C5%A0imund%C5%BEa\"&gt;Ante \u0160imund\u017ea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stipe%20Balaji%C4%87\"&gt;Stipe Balaji\u0107&lt;/a&gt; in the first half, and the club reached the group stages for the first time.\nMaribor played in Group A with &lt;a href=\"Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen\"&gt;Bayer Leverkusen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv\"&gt;Dynamo Kyiv&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"S.S.%20Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt;. In the first round, Maribor defeated Dynamo 1\u20130 in &lt;a href=\"Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; and topped the table; \u0160imund\u017ea became the first goal scorer for Maribor in the Champions League group stage after scoring in the 72nd minute. In the second round, Maribor lost 2\u20130 at home to Bayer Leverkusen; both goals were scored in the last eight minutes. Lazio then defeated Maribor twice, in the third and the fourth round. Both matches ended 4\u20130 for the Italian team. In the fifth round, Maribor lost 2\u20131 to Dynamo at home. In the final round, Maribor prevented Bayer from qualifying to the further stages; the match ended in a goalless draw, while Bayer needed a win to secure the second place in the group. Maribor were eliminated from the competition, finishing in the fourth and last place with four points.\nDecline and Intertoto success: 2000\u20132008.\nIn each of the next four seasons, Maribor were eliminated in the second qualifying round of the Champions League. The decline of the club in European competitions started in the &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2000\u201301&lt;/a&gt; season, when Maribor were surprisingly knocked out of the Champions League in the second qualifying round by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Zimbru%20Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u\"&gt;Zimbru Chi\u015fin\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; from Moldova. Maribor lost the first leg 2\u20130. In the return leg, &lt;a href=\"Nastja%20%C4%8Ceh\"&gt;Nastja \u010ceh&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal of the game in the third minute, and Zimbru eliminated Maribor 2\u20131 on aggregate. In the &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2001\u201302&lt;/a&gt; season, Maribor were drawn against the Scottish side &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;. The tie was already decided after the first match in Maribor, where Rangers won 3\u20130. In the second leg, Maribor took the lead at &lt;a href=\"Ibrox%20Stadium\"&gt;Ibrox Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, but Rangers then scored three times for 3\u20131, eliminating Maribor 6\u20131 on aggregate. In the &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2002\u201303&lt;/a&gt; season, Maribor were eliminated by &lt;a href=\"APOEL%20F.C.\"&gt;APOEL&lt;/a&gt;. The first match in Maribor ended 2\u20131 for the home side, but APOEL won the return leg 4\u20132 in Cyprus, and Maribor were again eliminated in the second qualifying round. In the next year, they were eliminated by &lt;a href=\"GNK%20Dinamo%20Zagreb\"&gt;Dinamo Zagreb&lt;/a&gt;, 3\u20132 on aggregate. The match in Maribor ended 1\u20131, while in the second leg in &lt;a href=\"Zagreb\"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt;, the Croatian champions won 2\u20131 and advanced to the third qualifying round.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20Slovenian%20PrvaLiga\"&gt;2003\u201304&lt;/a&gt; season, Maribor failed to win the national title for the first time since 1996, and therefore competed in the UEFA Cup for the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;2004\u201305&lt;/a&gt; season. They reached the first round, but were stopped by &lt;a href=\"Parma%20F.C.\"&gt;Parma&lt;/a&gt;. To reach the first round, Maribor eliminated &lt;a href=\"FK%20Sileks\"&gt;Sileks&lt;/a&gt; from Macedonia and &lt;a href=\"FK%20Budu%C4%87nost%20Banatski%20Dvor\"&gt;Budu\u0107nost Banatski Dvor&lt;/a&gt; from Serbia and Montenegro in the qualifying stages. Maribor did not qualify for European competitions for the 2005\u201306 season, having previously appeared in Europe in every season since the independence of Slovenia in 1991.\nMaribor have returned to European football in the 2006\u201307 season, when the team won its first European honour, becoming one of the eleven co-winners of the &lt;a href=\"2006%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In the first round, Maribor defeated &lt;a href=\"UE%20Sant%20Juli%C3%A0\"&gt;Sant Juli\u00e0&lt;/a&gt; from Andorra, before eliminating &lt;a href=\"FK%20Zeta\"&gt;Zeta&lt;/a&gt; who competed under the flag of newly established Montenegro. In the last round, Maribor played against &lt;a href=\"Villarreal%20CF\"&gt;Villarreal&lt;/a&gt;. The Spanish side played in the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;semi-finals&lt;/a&gt; of the Champions League just four months before the match between the two sides took place. In the first match in Spain, &lt;a href=\"Rene%20Miheli%C4%8D\"&gt;Rene Miheli\u010d&lt;/a&gt; scored in the 83rd minute for a 2\u20131 win. Ljudski vrt was filled with fans in the second leg, as 9,500 people gathered to see the match. Villarreal, who had three players sent off during the game, took the lead in the 85th minute, but &lt;a href=\"Gorazd%20Zajc\"&gt;Gorazd Zajc&lt;/a&gt; equalized just four minutes later to make it 3\u20132 on aggregate. On their official website, UEFA states that Maribor were one of the winners of the competition. However, the trophy itself was awarded to &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt;, the team that advanced the farthest in the UEFA Cup in that season. As one of the winners of the Intertoto Cup, Maribor continued their European campaign in the UEFA Cup, where they were eliminated by &lt;a href=\"FK%20Partizan\"&gt;Partizan&lt;/a&gt; in the second qualifying round.\nIn the next season, Maribor again competed in the &lt;a href=\"2007%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In the second round of the competition, the team lost 5\u20130 in the second leg against &lt;a href=\"FK%20Hajduk%20Kula\"&gt;Hajduk Kula&lt;/a&gt; after winning the first match 2\u20130, being eliminated 5\u20132 on aggregate. After losing the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Slovenian%20Cup\"&gt;2007\u201308 Slovenian Cup&lt;/a&gt; final to &lt;a href=\"NK%20Interblock\"&gt;Interblock&lt;/a&gt;, Maribor lost their place in European competitions for the 2008\u201309 season.\nZlatko Zahovi\u010d era: 2008\u20132020.\nMaribor's Director of Football, &lt;a href=\"Zlatko%20Zahovi%C4%8D\"&gt;Zlatko Zahovi\u010d&lt;/a&gt;, appointed &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Milani%C4%8D\"&gt;Darko Milani\u010d&lt;/a&gt; as the new manager in May 2008. In his first season, Maribor won the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Slovenian%20PrvaLiga\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; title for the first time since 2003. In the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, Maribor started in the second qualifying round against &lt;a href=\"FC%20WIT%20Georgia\"&gt;WIT&lt;/a&gt; from Georgia. The first match away from home ended scoreless. Maribor confirmed their spot in the third qualifying round at Ljudski vrt, where they won 3\u20131. They next played &lt;a href=\"FC%20Z%C3%BCrich\"&gt;Z\u00fcrich&lt;/a&gt;, and unexpectedly won the first match 3\u20132 at &lt;a href=\"Letzigrund\"&gt;Letzigrund&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Zoran%20Pavlovi%C4%87\"&gt;Zoran Pavlovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; scored the third goal directly from a &lt;a href=\"corner%20kick\"&gt;corner kick&lt;/a&gt; and later missed a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt;. 12,000 fans gathered for the second leg, where Maribor lost 3\u20130 and were eliminated. Maribor continued in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt; play-offs, but were eliminated by &lt;a href=\"AC%20Sparta%20Prague\"&gt;Sparta Prague&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 on aggregate. In the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20NK%20Maribor%20season\"&gt;2010\u201311&lt;/a&gt; season, Maribor reached the play-offs of the UEFA &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt;. After eliminating Hungarian team &lt;a href=\"Videoton%20FC\"&gt;Videoton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt; from Scotland. In the play-off round, Maribor played against &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt;.
