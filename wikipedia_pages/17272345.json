His good form continued in the &lt;a href=\"NSWRFL%20season%201944\"&gt;1944 season&lt;/a&gt;, as he helped &lt;a href=\"Newtown%20Jets\"&gt;Newtown&lt;/a&gt; become &lt;a href=\"minor%20premiers\"&gt;minor premiers&lt;/a&gt; and runners-up.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"NSWRFL%20season%201945\"&gt;1945 season&lt;/a&gt; Cahill was the competition's top try-scorer. He also represented &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; in the 1940s and was probably denied international representative honours due to the war.\nCoaching and Administrative career.\nHe took up coaching with the &lt;a href=\"Thirlmere\"&gt;Thirlmere&lt;/a&gt; club in the Wollongong competition from 1948 to 1950.
