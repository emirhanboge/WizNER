    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Brigadier%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Brigadier&lt;/a&gt; Edwin William Conquest Flavell &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Service%20Order\"&gt;DSO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;MC&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Medal%20bar\"&gt;Two Bars&lt;/a&gt; (22 February 1898 \u2013 29 November 1993) was a &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;officer&lt;/a&gt; who served in both &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. He served with great distinction during the latter, where he commanded the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Parachute%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;1st Parachute Brigade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"British%20airborne%20operations%20in%20North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"6th%20Airlanding%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;6th Airlanding Brigade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Overlord\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt;, before becoming Deputy Chief of Staff HQ &lt;a href=\"First%20Allied%20Airborne%20Army\"&gt;First Allied Airborne Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamily background.\nFlavell was born on 22 February 1898 at 15 Stansfield Road, Stockwell, London. He was educated at &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20College%20School\"&gt;King's College School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%2C%20London\"&gt;Wimbledon, London&lt;/a&gt;. Flavell died on 29 November 1993 aged 95. Some sources give 8 November or 1 December 1993 as the date of death.\nHe was the son of Edwin George Flavell and Emily Eliza Flavell (n\u00e9e Conquest) born 1870 and 1874 respectively.\nThe 1911 Census, dated 2 February, shows his father was a commercial clerk and that he had an older sister named Constance Lillian Flavell (1896\u20131978). Constance was a cashier in a drapery store or manufacturing outlet at the time. Edwin's younger brother, George Channell Flavell, was born in July 1911.\nEdwin Flavell married Nora Alice Cooper in 1920, they had two sons and one daughter. Both of Edwin's sons served during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Flavell%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%20officer%29\"&gt;Edwin James George \"Ted\" Flavell&lt;/a&gt; (1922\u20132014) was a Squadron Leader in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and James Sydney Channel \"Jim\" Flavell (1924\u20132008) served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment\"&gt;2nd Parachute Battalion&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Middlesex Regiment. Both brothers were at the ill-fated &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Arnhem\"&gt;Battle of Arnhem&lt;/a&gt; in 1944 where unfortunately, Jim was captured by Germans and remained a prisoner of war until 1945. In 1956, &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Flavell%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%20officer%29\"&gt;Ted&lt;/a&gt; carried out the first British air drop of an atomic bomb during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Buffalo%20%281956%29\"&gt;Operation Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"British%20nuclear%20tests%20at%20Maralinga\"&gt;Maralinga, South Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSadly, Edwin's father passed away at a young age of 49 in 1920. Six years later his mother, Emily Eliza Flavell, and his younger brother George, emigrated from England to New Zealand. They departed from Southampton, aboard the ship 'Hororata' on 10 April 1926, when George Channell Flavell was just 14 years old. Now grown, the elder children Constance Lillian and Edwin William Conquest Flavell, remained in England. Edwin's mother passed away at age 66 in 1940 and she is buried in Auckland, New Zealand.\nEdwin Flavell married a second time in 1971 to Kathleen Emily Fenton an accomplished concert pianist.\nIn the Ickenham Lodge No. 5770 (Middlesex) Members' Record Book, at the Consecration of the Lodge on 27 February 1939, it is noted that his occupation was \"company director\", then living at his Hampstead address.\nMilitary career.\nFirst World War.\nIn 1914, during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 17, Edwin William Conquest Flavell enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"East%20Surrey%20Regiment\"&gt;East Surrey Regiment&lt;/a&gt; and was &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; five months later. In 1916 he transferred to the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Machine%20Gun%20Corps\"&gt;Machine Gun Corps&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1917 he was believed to be the youngest &lt;a href=\"Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; serving in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Flanders area&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 20. He was wounded during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29\"&gt;Battle of Cambrai&lt;/a&gt; in the same year, and by the end of the conflict had been awarded the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;Military Cross&lt;/a&gt; a total of three times (referred to as the Military Cross and two Bars). The first was awarded for taking command of an infantry company that had lost all of its officers; by his leadership the unit was able to continue advancing. The second (his first bar) was for conducting several personal reconnaissances of enemy positions. In mid-March 1918, Flavell was transferred from the &lt;a href=\"19th%20%28Western%29%20Division\"&gt;19th (Western) Division&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"42nd%20%28East%20Lancashire%29%20Infantry%20Division\"&gt;42nd (East Lancashire) Division&lt;/a&gt;, where he took command of the 126th Machine Gun Company; one of the officers in the company was his future commanding officer, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29\"&gt;Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; (later &lt;a href=\"General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Gale%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29\"&gt;Richard Nelson Gale&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 21 March the Germans launched &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Michael\"&gt;Operation Michael&lt;/a&gt;, a major offensive against the British Army, and the 42nd Division moved into the frontline near Bapaume, replacing the &lt;a href=\"46th%20%28North%20Midland%29%20Division\"&gt;46th (North Midland) Division&lt;/a&gt; who had taken heavy casualties. The offensive was repulsed, and by the end of August the division had advanced towards the &lt;a href=\"Hindenburg%20Line\"&gt;Hindenburg Line&lt;/a&gt;. Forming a part of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;British Third Army&lt;/a&gt;, the division then made rapid advances towards Bapaume and by the end of September had reached the Hindenburg Line; on 27 September Flavell's brigade, the &lt;a href=\"126th%20%28East%20Lancashire%29%20Brigade\"&gt;126th (East Lancashire)&lt;/a&gt;, was tasked with capturing Highland Ridge, near Havrincourt Wood. The next day, after the brigade had reached the top of the ridge, Gale's machine gun section sighted in on two German field guns moving parallel to their position; they sighted in on the horses leading the guns, but just before they could open fire, Flavell arrived. According to Gale, \"Flavell could not resist and, firing one of the guns himself, he brought down the leading horses;\" the crews fled and the section was able to capture the two guns. This action resulted in Flavell being awarded his third Military Cross (second bar).\nSecond World War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"interwar%20period\"&gt;interwar period&lt;/a&gt; Flavell remained on the active list of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Surrey%20Regiment\"&gt;East Surrey Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, but became involved in the shipping industry with a business partner from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; broke out in September 1939, Flavell was recalled to the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently given command of the 2/7th Middlesex Regiment. He saw service during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20France\"&gt;Battle of France&lt;/a&gt; in 1940, and was then given the task of raising the 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion. On 22 June 1940, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Churchill\"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt;, created the British airborne establishment when he directed the &lt;a href=\"War%20Office\"&gt;War Office&lt;/a&gt; in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a &lt;a href=\"corps\"&gt;corps&lt;/a&gt; of 5,000 parachute troops. In 1941 the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Parachute%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;1st Parachute Brigade&lt;/a&gt; was formed, with &lt;a href=\"Brigadier%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Brigadier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Gale%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29\"&gt;Richard N. Gale&lt;/a&gt;, Flavell's former commanding officer, as its commander. Gale selected Flavell, now a &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;, to raise and then command the &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment\"&gt;2nd Parachute Battalion&lt;/a&gt; which would form part of the brigade. His adjutant was &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Frost%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29\"&gt;John D. Frost&lt;/a&gt;, who would later become famous for commanding the battalion during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Arnhem\"&gt;Battle of Arnhem&lt;/a&gt;; both men qualified as parachutists in October 1941. In January 1942 Flavell gave Frost command over &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Biting\"&gt;Operation Biting&lt;/a&gt;, a raid on a radar station on the French coast near &lt;a href=\"Bruneval\"&gt;Bruneval&lt;/a&gt;; the raid, which took place in February, was successful and brought back vital technology.\nIn the spring of 1942 Gale was promoted to Deputy Director of Staff Duties at the War Office, and he passed command of the brigade over to Flavell. Flavell, promoted to brigadier, transferred command of 2nd Parachute Battalion to &lt;a href=\"Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gofton-Salmond\"&gt;Gofton-Salmond&lt;/a&gt;, and in the beginning of November the brigade was sent to North Africa as part of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Torch\"&gt;Operation Torch&lt;/a&gt;. Because of a shortage of aircraft, the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment\"&gt;3rd Parachute Battalion&lt;/a&gt; was forced to travel separately from the brigade, arriving on 11 November; the rest of the brigade, including Flavell, arrived the next day. He commanded the brigade for the whole of the &lt;a href=\"British%20airborne%20operations%20in%20North%20Africa\"&gt;period that it fought in North Africa&lt;/a&gt;, and was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Service%20Order\"&gt;Distinguished Service Order&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the brigade's service in the theatre; the citation stated that Flavell and the brigade had \"fought magnificently and set a standard to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;1st Army&lt;/a&gt; difficult to emulate.\" Under his command the brigade had sustained 1,700 casualties and taken more than 3,500 &lt;a href=\"Axis%20powers\"&gt;Axis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prisoner%20of%20war\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as winning eight Distinguished Service Orders, fifteen &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;Military Cross&lt;/a&gt;es, nine &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Conduct%20Medal\"&gt;Distinguished Conduct Medal&lt;/a&gt;s and twenty-two &lt;a href=\"Military%20Medal\"&gt;Military Medal&lt;/a&gt;s. Flavell had a difficult time commanding the brigade while it was in North Africa. He was hampered by the fact that there were no senior officers who knew how to use &lt;a href=\"airborne%20forces\"&gt;airborne forces&lt;/a&gt; properly and efficiently, meaning that the airborne missions that were given to the brigade were often unsuitable to its abilities. The same problems occurred when it was used in a ground role, for which it was considered to be unsuited, and Flavell found it difficult to prevent this occurring.\nThe brigade ended its operations in North Africa in mid-April 1943, and Flavell left for England in June to take up a new command. He was replaced as commander of 1st Parachute Brigade by Brigadier &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Lathbury\"&gt;Gerald W. Lathbury&lt;/a&gt;. He became commander, Airborne Establishments, which was tasked with promoting closer cooperation with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; as well as providing reinforcements for the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;1st Airborne Division&lt;/a&gt; and aiding in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Independent%20Parachute%20Brigade%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade&lt;/a&gt;. Then on 12 June 1944, he was given command of the &lt;a href=\"6th%20Airlanding%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;6th Airlanding Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"6th%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;6th Airborne Division&lt;/a&gt;, commanded by Major-General Richard N. Gale. On the night of 5 June the division conducted &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Tonga\"&gt;Operation Tonga&lt;/a&gt;, the British airborne portion of the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Normandy\"&gt;invasion of Normandy&lt;/a&gt;. As an airlanding brigade equipped with &lt;a href=\"Military%20glider\"&gt;glider&lt;/a&gt;s, the brigade was the last unit belonging to the division to arrive, landing at 21:00 on 6 June in landing zone 'W' after it had been secured by the rest of the division. Flavell continued to command the 6th Airlanding Brigade throughout the period that 6th Airborne Division fought in Normandy, as well as when the division fought in the &lt;a href=\"Ardennes\"&gt;Ardennes forest&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge\"&gt;German offensive&lt;/a&gt; there in December 1944. He was involved with \"&lt;a href=\"Operation%20Market%20Garden\"&gt;Operation Market Garden&lt;/a&gt;\" at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Arnhem\"&gt;Arnhem&lt;/a&gt; where his son, James, also fought and another son was involved towing the gliders for troop landings. He was then appointed as Deputy &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20staff\"&gt;Chief of Staff&lt;/a&gt; HQ in &lt;a href=\"First%20Allied%20Airborne%20Army\"&gt;First Allied Airborne Army&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently made an Officer of the American &lt;a href=\"Legion%20of%20Merit\"&gt;Legion of Merit&lt;/a&gt;.\nPostwar activities.\nFlavell retired from the British Army in 1945. In the 1945 general election, Flavell stood as the Conservative candidate for North-West Hendon in London, but was defeated by a slim margin. After this, he became involved in property development and also managing his own company. In 1948 he was appointed as Deputy Lieutenant for Middlesex, and some time later became the chairman of the County of Middlesex &lt;a href=\"Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Territorial Army&lt;/a&gt; Association.\nFreemasonry.\nMemberships and offices.\nAppendant bodies.\nAll the lodges and Chapters which he founded or with which he was associated are extant (2013).\nWhilst serving as Provincial Grand Master of Berkshire, he was responsible for the sale of part of the Sindlesham Masonic Centre land to the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution (homes for the elderly). The home was named Lord Harris Court, and he had a flat there (which, allegedly, he never used). Rooms in the Sindlesham Centre are named \"The Edwin Flavell Suite\".\nCricket references.\nPlaying member, Honorary Life Member and President for 25 years, (between 1949 \u2013 1973), of Ickenham Cricket Club."
