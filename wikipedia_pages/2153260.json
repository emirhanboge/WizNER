The station is owned by &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Television\"&gt;Gray Television&lt;/a&gt;. KAIT's studios are located on New Haven Church Road (&lt;a href=\"Craighead%20County%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;County Road&lt;/a&gt; 766) north of Jonesboro, and its transmitter is located in &lt;a href=\"Egypt%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Egypt, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nKAIT first signed on July 15, 1963, as an &lt;a href=\"Independent%20station%20%28North%20America%29\"&gt;independent station&lt;/a&gt;, a venture of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Smith%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Fort Smith&lt;/a&gt; businessman George Hernreich. It has been affiliated with ABC since 1965.\nMost television markets in the country received at least two VHF commercial channels. However, the Jonesboro market could only receive \"one\" VHF license because it was sandwiched between &lt;a href=\"Springfield%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Springfield&lt;/a&gt; (channels &lt;a href=\"KYTV%20%28TV%29\"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"KOLR\"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;) to the west, &lt;a href=\"Memphis%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Memphis&lt;/a&gt; (channels &lt;a href=\"WREG-TV\"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WMC-TV\"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WKNO%20%28TV%29\"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"WHBQ-TV\"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;) to the east, &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Girardeau%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Cape Girardeau&lt;/a&gt; (channels &lt;a href=\"WSIL-TV\"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WPSD-TV\"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WSIU-TV\"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"KFVS-TV\"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;) to the north, and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Little Rock&lt;/a&gt; (channels &lt;a href=\"Arkansas%20Educational%20Television%20Network\"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KARK-TV\"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KATV\"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"KTHV\"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;) to the south. KAIT was fortunate to receive this license, and as a result became the only television station to serve Jonesboro until KTEJ signed on the air in May 1976.\nThe Hernreich family sold the station to Channel Communications in 1984. That company, in turn, sold KAIT to Cosmos Broadcasting, the broadcasting arm of &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina\"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;-based insurer &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Corporation\"&gt;Liberty Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, in 1986. Liberty exited the insurance business in 2000, bringing the Cosmos stations directly under the Liberty banner. Previous owner &lt;a href=\"Raycom%20Media\"&gt;Raycom Media&lt;/a&gt; obtained the station in 2005 through its purchase of Liberty.\nFor many years, KAIT also operated a &lt;a href=\"low-power%20broadcasting%23Television\"&gt;low-power&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"broadcast%20relay%20station%23Broadcast%20translators\"&gt;translator station&lt;/a&gt;, K11JW, operating on Channel 11 in nearby &lt;a href=\"Blytheville%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Blytheville&lt;/a&gt;. It is not to be confused with present-day K11JW-D in &lt;a href=\"Russellville%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Russellville&lt;/a&gt;, currently serving as a translator for &lt;a href=\"Arkansas%20PBS\"&gt;Arkansas PBS&lt;/a&gt; member KAFT.\nBefore the digital transition, the Little Rock-area VHF stations, including KATV (channel 7) and KARK (channel 4), adequately covered parts of the KAIT viewing area. Several &lt;a href=\"cable%20television\"&gt;cable&lt;/a&gt; systems in the KAIT viewing area, including Jonesboro and Blytheville, have carried KATV for decades. In compliance with &lt;a href=\"Syndication%20exclusivity\"&gt;syndex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"must-carry\"&gt;must-carry&lt;/a&gt; regulations, some systems may &lt;a href=\"Blackout%20%28broadcasting%29\"&gt;black out&lt;/a&gt; KATV and KARK when either station airs the same program as KAIT, usually during the daytime and prime time hours, except for breaking news, weather bulletins, and regularly-scheduled newscasts. Other cable systems in parts of the KAIT viewing area that are within in the Little Rock television market that also carry KATV, such as in &lt;a href=\"Searcy%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Searcy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heber%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Heber Springs&lt;/a&gt;, carry both stations without restrictions.\nKAIT has been digital-only since June 12, 2009. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 9 to channel 8 for post-transition operations.\nSale to Gray Television.\nOn June 25, 2018, &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Television\"&gt;Gray Television&lt;/a&gt; announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom's 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including KAIT, and Gray's 93 television stations) under the former's corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion \u2013 in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom \u2013 will result in Gray's entry into Arkansas with KAIT. The sale was approved on December 20, and was completed on January 2, 2019.\nTransmitter upgrades.\nOn October 4, 2021, KAIT announced it would upgrade its main transmitter to improve its broadcast signal, forcing many antenna viewers to rescan their channels before November 9 so that they would not lose access to the three subchannels, and causing KAIT to broadcast over the K24NY-D transmitter for one week.\nSubchannel history.\nKAIT-DT2.\nKAIT-DT2 is the &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;-affiliated second digital subchannel of KAIT. &lt;a href=\"terrestrial%20television\"&gt;Over the air&lt;/a&gt;, KAIT-DT2 broadcasts a &lt;a href=\"720p\"&gt;720p&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"high-definition%20television\"&gt;high definition&lt;/a&gt; signal (downconverted from the native &lt;a href=\"1080i\"&gt;1080i&lt;/a&gt; resolution of the NBC network, to preserve bandwidth so that KAIT-DT3 can transmit in 720p HD over-the-air) on virtual and VHF channel 8.2; however, a direct-to-cable full 1080i high definition feed of this subchannel is available on select cable providers.\nKAIT began carrying NBC programming on its second digital subchannel on January 26, 2015. The subchannel used to broadcast 24/7 weather coverage, and occasionally local sports coverage, starting in 2006. In addition to the NBC network schedule, syndicated programming on KAIT-DT2 includes \"&lt;a href=\"Jeopardy%21\"&gt;Jeopardy!&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Phil%20%28talk%20show%29\"&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Inside%20Edition\"&gt;Inside Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Tonight\"&gt;Entertainment Tonight&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Right%20This%20Minute\"&gt;Right This Minute&lt;/a&gt;\", among others.\nKAIT-DT3.\nKAIT-DT3 is the &lt;a href=\"The%20CW\"&gt;CW&lt;/a&gt;-affiliated third digital subchannel of KAIT, broadcasting in 720p high definition on virtual and VHF channel 8.3 (hence the on-air branding KAIT CW 8.3). All programming on KAIT-DT3 is received through The CW's programming feed for smaller media markets, &lt;a href=\"The%20CW%20Plus\"&gt;The CW Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a set schedule of syndicated programming acquired by The CW for broadcast during time periods outside of the network's regular programming hours; however, Gray Television handles local advertising and promotional services for the subchannel. Upon its inception, KAIT-DT3 had been broadcast in the &lt;a href=\"widescreen\"&gt;widescreen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Standard-definition%20television\"&gt;standard definition&lt;/a&gt; picture format as, meanwhile, a direct-to-cable 720p high definition feed of this subchannel had been made available on select cable providers; however, ever since an upgrade to KAIT's &lt;a href=\"Multiplex%20%28television%29\"&gt;multiplexer&lt;/a&gt; equipment sometime in October 2019, KAIT-DT3 has been broadcasting in HD over-the-air as well.\nThe subchannel used to broadcast &lt;a href=\"Raycom%20Media\"&gt;Raycom Media&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"The%20Tube%20Music%20Network\"&gt;The Tube&lt;/a&gt; beginning in 2006, until the network\u2019s shutdown on October 1, 2007. The subchannel would not rebroadcast until 11 years later.\nOn July 25, 2018, KAIT announced it would be bringing The CW programming (via their national CW+ service) into the Jonesboro market through a third subchannel, starting on September 1, 2018; CW programming had previously been seen on cable systems under the false call sign \"KJOS\" (which stood for K-JOneSboro's WB 21). \"KJOS\" seamlessly became associated with the new CW network (branded as \"Jonesboro's CW 21\") on September 18, 2006, after the merger of The WB and &lt;a href=\"UPN\"&gt;UPN&lt;/a&gt; into that one network.\nOn September 11, 2020, KAIT-DT3 started broadcasting &lt;a href=\"Tegna%20Inc.\"&gt;Tegna&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Blast%20Live\"&gt;Daily Blast Live&lt;/a&gt;\" at noon.\nProgramming.\nSyndicated programming.\nIn addition to the ABC network schedule, &lt;a href=\"Broadcast%20syndication\"&gt;syndicated programming&lt;/a&gt; on KAIT includes \"&lt;a href=\"Wheel%20of%20Fortune%20%28American%20game%20show%29\"&gt;Wheel of Fortune&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20Show\"&gt;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Live%20with%20Kelly%20and%20Ryan\"&gt;Live with Kelly and Ryan&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Judge%20Judy\"&gt;Judge Judy&lt;/a&gt;\", among others.\nNews operation.\nKAIT presently broadcasts 24\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4\u00bd hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays).\nIn addition to reporting on local news stories, members of KAIT's reporting staff are also employed as photojournalists for the station. On October 15, 2007, beginning with the 5 p.m. newscast, KAIT's local newscasts were rebranded, replacing the former \"K8 News\" branding with \"Region 8 News\", a branding the station had used during much of the 1980s. The station's longtime slogan \"Good Neighbors You Can Turn To\" (also \"Your Good Neighbor Station\") was also replaced with a new slogan (\"Always Tracking. Always Watching. Always On.\")\nOn September 16, 2011, KAIT announced that upgrade its newscasts to &lt;a href=\"high-definition%20television\"&gt;high definition&lt;/a&gt;, and broadcast from a new set; the following night, fellow ABC affiliate KATV in Little Rock started broadcasting its local newscasts in HD. On October 17, 2011, beginning with its 11 a.m. newscast, KAIT became the fourth station in Arkansas (the first in Jonesboro) to broadcast its local newscast in high definition.\nAlthough not owned by the same company, KAIT frequently forms a partnership with the Jonesboro Radio Group for community projects and promotions. The three Jonesboro Radio Group stations involved in the partnership are &lt;a href=\"KEGI\"&gt;KEGI&lt;/a&gt; (100.5 FM), &lt;a href=\"KDXY\"&gt;KDXY&lt;/a&gt; (104.9 FM) and &lt;a href=\"KJBX\"&gt;KJBX&lt;/a&gt; (106.3 FM). An audio simulcast of KAIT's 6 p.m. newscast airs weekday evenings on KJBX.\nSubchannels.\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOut-of-market coverage.\nKAIT's home market only comprises &lt;a href=\"Craighead%20County%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Craighead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clay%20County%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greene%20County%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Greene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jackson%20County%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20County%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Randolph%20County%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Randolph&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20County%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt; counties in Arkansas. With KAIT's 28,200 &lt;a href=\"watt\"&gt;watt&lt;/a&gt;s worth of effective radiated power, KAIT's signal can extend into nearby portions of all neighboring markets (e.g. the Memphis, Little Rock, &lt;a href=\"Springfield%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Springfield, MO&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Girardeau%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Cape Girardeau, MO&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Paducah%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Paducah, KY&lt;/a&gt; markets). Even after the digital transition of 2009, KAIT's over-the-air signal can still be picked up as far south as &lt;a href=\"Forrest%20City%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Forrest City&lt;/a&gt;, as far north as &lt;a href=\"Hendrickson%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Hendrickson, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, as far west as &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20View%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Mountain View&lt;/a&gt; and as far east as &lt;a href=\"Tiptonville%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Tiptonville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caruthersville%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Caruthersville, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the northern suburbs of Memphis can also pick up at least a grade B signal.\nKAIT was dropped from New Wave Communications in Southeast Missouri, in favor of in-market ABC affiliate &lt;a href=\"WSIL-TV\"&gt;WSIL&lt;/a&gt; and NBC affiliate &lt;a href=\"WPSD-TV\"&gt;WPSD&lt;/a&gt; on December 31, 2017."
