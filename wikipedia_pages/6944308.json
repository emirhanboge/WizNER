    "text": "The Museum of Arts and Design (MAD), based in &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, collects, displays, and interprets objects that document contemporary and historic innovation in craft, art, and design. In its exhibitions and educational programs, the Museum celebrates the creative process through which materials are crafted into works that enhance contemporary life.\nHistory.\nThe Museum first opened its doors in 1956 as the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, with an original mission of recognizing the craftsmanship of contemporary American artists. Nurtured by the vision of philanthropist and craft patron &lt;a href=\"Aileen%20Osborn%20Webb\"&gt;Aileen Osborn Webb&lt;/a&gt;, the Museum mounted exhibitions that focused on the materials and techniques associated with craft disciplines. From its earliest years, the Museum celebrated the changing roles of craftsmanship in society, served as an important advocate for emerging artists, and linked art to industry.\nFrom 1963 to 1987, under the directorship of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20J.%20Smith%20%28arts%20administrator%29\"&gt;Paul J. Smith&lt;/a&gt;, the Museum presented dynamic and often participatory exhibitions that reflected the social currents of the era and broke down hierarchies in the arts with the celebration of popular culture and mundane materials. In 1979, the Museum reopened as the American Craft Museum in an expanded location at 44 West &lt;a href=\"53rd%20Street\"&gt;53rd Street&lt;/a&gt;. To accommodate its ever-growing programming, the Museum relocated again in 1986 to its 18,000-square-foot home at 40 West 53rd Street, where it would remain until 2008.\nThe next ten years were a period of rapid growth and change, as the &lt;a href=\"American%20Craft%20Council\"&gt;American Craft Council&lt;/a&gt; was restructured and the Museum and the Council were established as independent organizations. &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Hotchner\"&gt;Holly Hotchner&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as director of the Museum in 1996, and served as director for 16 years until 2013. Hotchner initiated a comprehensive strategic planning process that expanded the Board of Trustees, curatorial staff, and exhibition and educational program. This process led to the Museum's name change, in 2002, to the Museum of Arts and Design to reflect the institution's increasingly interdisciplinary collections and programming. The continued growth of MAD's collections, public programs, and attendance resulted in its successful 2002 bid to the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Economic%20Development%20Corporation\"&gt;New York City Economic Development Corporation&lt;/a&gt; to acquire the building at 2 Columbus Circle.\nThe Museum opened in its new home at &lt;a href=\"2%20Columbus%20Circle\"&gt;2 Columbus Circle&lt;/a&gt; to great controversy. The proposed changes to the building originally designed by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Durell%20Stone\"&gt;Edward Durell Stone&lt;/a&gt; sparked a preservation debate joined by &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Wolfe\"&gt;Tom Wolfe&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\"; October 12, 2003 and October 13, 2003), &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Close\"&gt;Chuck Close&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Stella\"&gt;Frank Stella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20A.%20M.%20Stern\"&gt;Robert A. M. Stern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20University\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt; art history department chairman &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Bergdoll\"&gt;Barry Bergdoll&lt;/a&gt;, \"New York Times\" architecture critics &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Muschamp\"&gt;Herbert Muschamp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nicolai%20Ouroussoff\"&gt;Nicolai Ouroussoff&lt;/a&gt;, urbanist scholar &lt;a href=\"Witold%20Rybczynski\"&gt;Witold Rybczynski&lt;/a&gt;, among others. Congresswoman &lt;a href=\"Carolyn%20B.%20Maloney\"&gt;Carolyn B. Maloney&lt;/a&gt; (D-NY) referred to it as \"one of New York's most photographed and readily recognizable buildings.\"\nThe new building was designed by &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Cloepfil\"&gt;Brad Cloepfil&lt;/a&gt; of Allied Works Architecture, in September 2008. With its textured fa\u00e7ade of glazed terra-cotta tile and fritted glass, the Jerome and Simona Chazen Building reflects MAD's craft heritage and permanent collections.\nIn September 2013, Dr. &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Adamson\"&gt;Glenn Adamson&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as the museum's new &lt;a href=\"Nanette%20L.%20Laitman\"&gt;Nanette L. Laitman&lt;/a&gt; Director. Previously a vocal critic of the museum, Adamson was characterized as a \"bold choice\" by the trustees. After a tenure of just over two years, Adamson stepped down from the post. Chris Scoates was appointed Director of the Museum in March 2018. Scoates stepped down from his post in August 2020, making him the fourth leader at the venerable New York institution to leave the institution's job top in the past decade.\n2 Columbus Circle location.\nThe new location at 2 Columbus Circle, with more than , more than tripled the size of the Museum's former space. It includes: four floors of exhibition galleries for works by established and emerging artists; a 150-seat auditorium in which the museum plans to feature lectures, films, and performances; and a restaurant. It also includes a Center for the Study of &lt;a href=\"Jewelry\"&gt;Jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, and an Education Center that offers multi-media access to primary source material, hands-on classrooms for students, and three artists-in-residence studios."
