    "text": "Ecotone (formerly Royal Wessanen) is a &lt;a href=\"Multinational%20corporation\"&gt;multinational&lt;/a&gt; food company with a focus on organic, founded in &lt;a href=\"the%20Netherlands\"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and headquartered in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; since November 2020. It has operations in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;. Worldwide it had approx 2,000 employees at the end of 2011, a year in which it reported a revenue of \u20ac706 million. The company is owned by &lt;a href=\"PAI%20Partners\"&gt;PAI Partners&lt;/a&gt; (62 %) and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Jobson\"&gt;Charles Jobson&lt;/a&gt; (38 %), shares for the company were delisted.\nHistory.\n'Wessanen en Laan' was founded in 1765 in &lt;a href=\"Wormerveer\"&gt;Wormerveer&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Adriaan%20Wessanen\"&gt;Adriaan Wessanen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dirk%20Laan\"&gt;Dirk Laan&lt;/a&gt; to trade in \u2018Mustard, Canary and other seeds\u2019. The company flourished as new uses were found for all sorts of seeds. It was helped by the contemporary popularity for keeping caged birds, particularly canaries.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the landscape around the &lt;a href=\"Zaan\"&gt;Zaan&lt;/a&gt; river was dominated by merchants\u2019 houses, their warehouses and, most distinctively, their &lt;a href=\"windmills\"&gt;windmills&lt;/a&gt;. In the pre-industrial age, the windmills functioned as sophisticated processing plants, using wind power to crush, grind and mix all manner of ingredients.\nWessanen was by the start of the 20th century a large company, and following the award of royal warrants it was now known as NV Wessanen Koninklijke Fabrieken (royal factories). With a diversified global sales market, it was able to survive war, tariff barriers and the demise of colonialism. But it was still a typically Dutch company, with production facilities on the Zaan River.\nActivities.\nWessanen works with organic or natural food\nIn Europe Wessanen is, next to the Netherlands (Wessanen Benelux, Natudis, Foodprints, Kroon Biologische Verswaren), active in &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; (Hagor-Bioservice), &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; (Allos Hof-Manufaktur GmbH, Allos GmbH, Allos Schwarzwald GmbH), &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (Bjorg Bonneterre et Compagnie), the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (Kallo Foods, &lt;a href=\"Clipper%20tea\"&gt;Clipper tea&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; (Bio Slym, Abafoods).\nWessanen decided to leave the North American market. Its Tree of Life unit, part of the firm since 1985, was sold to Chicago-based &lt;a href=\"Kehe%20Food%20Distributors\"&gt;Kehe Food Distributors&lt;/a&gt; for $190 million in early 2010.
