    "text": "Guadix Cathedral, Cathedral of Guadix, or Cathedral of the Incarnation () is a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"church%20architecture\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Guadix\"&gt;Guadix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20Granada\"&gt;province of Granada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. Construction of the building began in the 16th century and was completed in the mid-18th century. It is in the &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20architecture\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; style.\nLocation and historical context.\nGuadix is believed to be one of the oldest &lt;a href=\"diocese\"&gt;diocesan&lt;/a&gt; seats in Spain; tradition has it that the diocese was founded by Saint &lt;a href=\"Torquatus%20of%20Acci\"&gt;Torquatus of Acci&lt;/a&gt; in the first century A.D. The cathedral sits on the site of an earlier Hispano-&lt;a href=\"Visigoth\"&gt;Visigoth&lt;/a&gt;ic church extant in the 10th century, and which functioned during the Islamic period as a &lt;a href=\"mosque\"&gt;mosque&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the \"&lt;a href=\"Reconquista\"&gt;Reconquista&lt;/a&gt;\", Guadix was captured by the Christian forces in 1489, and the Hispano-Visigothic church was reestablished as the seat of a &lt;a href=\"Episcopal%20see\"&gt;bishopric&lt;/a&gt;. It was given the name of the Church of Saint Mary of the Incarnation (\"Iglesia de Santa Mar\u00eda de la Encarnaci\u00f3n\"), was made a cathedral by a &lt;a href=\"papal%20bull\"&gt;bull&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Innocent%20VIII\"&gt;Pope Innocent VIII&lt;/a&gt;, and was somewhat expanded under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20de%20Morales\"&gt;Pedro de Morales&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlans were made to replace the old church with a &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt; cathedral as a symbol of the \"Reconquista\", but by the time construction began, that style was already considered antiquated. Cardinal \u00c1valos and others wanted a cathedral more in accord with the style of the times. &lt;a href=\"Diego%20de%20Silo%C3%A9\"&gt;Diego de Silo\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; was commissioned in 1549 to develop a design reflecting the influence of the cathedrals of &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A1laga\"&gt;M\u00e1laga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Granada\"&gt;Granada&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"apse\"&gt;apse&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"crossing%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;crossing&lt;/a&gt;, the chapel of Don Tadeo and parte part of the &lt;a href=\"sacristy\"&gt;sacristy&lt;/a&gt; were completed according to Silo\u00e9's plan.\nConstruction.\nBesides Silo\u00e9, &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Rold%C3%A1n\"&gt;Francisco Rold\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Antero\"&gt;Francisco Antero&lt;/a&gt;, and others were involved in designing the new cathedral. Silo\u00e9 planned the main chapel in a &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20architecture\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; style, with an alternation of straight lines and curves, with profuse decoration in the classical style and highly developed &lt;a href=\"entablature\"&gt;entablature&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Freyla brothers, Pedro and Miguel, worked many years on a tower intended as an emblem of identity for the city.\nIn 1574, work stopped for lack of money, and was not resumed until 1594, when Bishop &lt;a href=\"Juan%20de%20Fonseca%20y%20Guzm%C3%A1n\"&gt;Juan de Fonseca y Guzm\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; resumed the project.\nThe work received a new impulse at the end of the 17th century and beginning of the 18th with economic assistance from the king. &lt;a href=\"Blas%20Antonio%20Delgado\"&gt;Blas Antonio Delgado&lt;/a&gt; was placed in charge of the new plans, with changes in the design giving more emphasis to horizontal lines. Delgado laid out the general design of the cathedral, the &lt;a href=\"elevation%20%28view%29\"&gt;elevations&lt;/a&gt;, the doors and the &lt;a href=\"cupola\"&gt;cupola&lt;/a&gt;, but in 1714 had to move to &lt;a href=\"Ja%C3%A9n%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Ja\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vicente%20Acero%20%2818th%20century%29\"&gt;Vicente Acero&lt;/a&gt; took over, reworking the plan extensively, before also having to move on. The city government approached &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20de%20Hurtado%20Izquierdo\"&gt;Francisco de Hurtado Izquierdo&lt;/a&gt;; rather than take on the project himself, he recommended &lt;a href=\"Gaspar%20Cay%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Vega\"&gt;Gaspar Cay\u00f3n de la Vega&lt;/a&gt;. The strong imprint of Cay\u00f3n de la Vega can be seen in the latter stages of construction of the building, in the vaulting, the dome, and in the \"portada de las Azucenas\"\u2014the front portion of the building, utilizing a motif of lilies\u2014which Acero had begun.\nWhen Cay\u00f3n de la Vega left for &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A1diz\"&gt;C\u00e1diz&lt;/a&gt; in 1731, the fa\u00e7ade was under construction according to his plans, but others such as Vicente Acero, Pachote, and Thomas added pieces that were not in Cay\u00f3n's plan.\nCharacteristics.\nThe chapel of Don Tadeo shows strong Italian structural influences in its solution to the problem of vaulting arches within a cylindrical structure. Another notable element is the front of the sacristy, with its &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20architecture\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; pediment, its entablature, and the arch between &lt;a href=\"Corinthian%20column\"&gt;Corinthian column&lt;/a&gt;s with the coats of arms of the bishops of the city.\nThe fa\u00e7ade is a splendid example of the &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20architecture\"&gt;Baroque architecture&lt;/a&gt;, with two massed bodies and a pinnacle, with alternating concave and convex lines; the large central span, flanked by two lintels composed of groups of broad-based columns. The upper part was realized by &lt;a href=\"Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Pachote\"&gt;Fern\u00e1ndez Pachote&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Domingo%20Thomas\"&gt;Domingo Thomas&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Valeriano%20Moyano\"&gt;Antonio Valeriano Moyano&lt;/a&gt; sculpted the marble Incarnation."
