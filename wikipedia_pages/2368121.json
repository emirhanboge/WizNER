    "text": "Yelets, or Elets (), is a &lt;a href=\"types%20of%20inhabited%20localities%20in%20Russia\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lipetsk%20Oblast\"&gt;Lipetsk Oblast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, situated on the &lt;a href=\"Bystraya%20Sosna%20River\"&gt;Bystraya Sosna River&lt;/a&gt;, which is a tributary of the &lt;a href=\"Don%20River%2C%20Russia\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt;. Population: \nHistory.\nYelets is the oldest center of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Black%20Earth%20Region\"&gt;Central Black Earth Region&lt;/a&gt;. It was mentioned in historical documents as early as 1146 or 1147, when it was a fort belonging to the Princes of &lt;a href=\"Ryazan\"&gt;Ryazan&lt;/a&gt;. The town's position at the very south of Russian lands made it an easy prey for Turkic conquerors. The &lt;a href=\"Mongols\"&gt;Mongols&lt;/a&gt; burned it in 1239, &lt;a href=\"Uzbeg%20Khan\"&gt;Uzbeg Khan&lt;/a&gt; ravaged it in 1316, &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; sacked it in 1395, and the &lt;a href=\"Tatars\"&gt;Tatars&lt;/a&gt; devastated it in 1414.\nIn 1483, the Principality of Yelets was absorbed by the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, while the local &lt;a href=\"Rurik%20Dynasty\"&gt;Rurikid&lt;/a&gt; rulers (last heard of in the 19th century) entered the service of &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20III%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Ivan\u00a0III&lt;/a&gt;. In 1591, &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Godunov\"&gt;Boris Godunov&lt;/a&gt; revived the largely deserted town by establishing a fortress there. In 1618, the fortress was captured \"by subterfuge\" by 20,000\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cossacks\"&gt;Cossacks&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Petro%20Konashevych-Sahaidachny\"&gt;Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny&lt;/a&gt;, allied with &lt;a href=\"W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20IV%20Vasa\"&gt;W\u0142adys\u0142aw\u00a0IV&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. They dismantled a large part of town fortifications.\nIn the 19th century, Yelets became the largest trade center of the region. Handmade &lt;a href=\"lace\"&gt;lace&lt;/a&gt; has been a notable product of the city since then; other important industries are grain milling and the manufacture of machinery. The town's chief landmark is the vast Ascension Cathedral, built over the years 1845\u20131889 to a Neo-Muscovite design by &lt;a href=\"Konstantin%20Thon\"&gt;Konstantin Thon&lt;/a&gt;. The town was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;German Army&lt;/a&gt; from December 4 to 9, 1941 and damaged during the brief occupation and Soviet offensive in the region.\nAdministrative and municipal status.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Administrative%20divisions\"&gt;framework of administrative divisions&lt;/a&gt;, Yelets serves as the &lt;a href=\"administrative%20center\"&gt;administrative center&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yeletsky%20District\"&gt;Yeletsky District&lt;/a&gt;, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated as Yelets &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20federal%20subject%20significance\"&gt;City Under Oblast Jurisdiction&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the &lt;a href=\"administrative%20divisions%20of%20Lipetsk%20Oblast\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt;. As a &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Municipal%20divisions\"&gt;municipal division&lt;/a&gt;, Yelets City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Yelets Urban Okrug.\nEconomy and transportation.\nThe city is connected to &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lipetsk\"&gt;Lipetsk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oryol\"&gt;Oryol&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rostov\"&gt;Rostov&lt;/a&gt; by rail and the &lt;a href=\"M4%20highway%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;M4 highway&lt;/a&gt; runs past it.\nThe main industries are limestone quarrying, engineering, food processing, textiles and clothing (Yelets Lace), tobacco processing, and vodka distilling.\nCulture and education.\nThe city has a theatre, cinemas, and several sports venues.\nThe Yelets State University was upgraded from an institute in 2000 and the city has eight secondary schools."
