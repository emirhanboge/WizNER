    "text": "The Capture, published in 1997 and written by &lt;a href=\"K.%20A.%20Applegate\"&gt;K. A. Applegate&lt;/a&gt;, is the sixth book in the \"&lt;a href=\"Animorphs\"&gt;Animorphs&lt;/a&gt;\" series. It is narrated by &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Berenson\"&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt;. \"The Capture\" was re-released by Scholastic in March 2012.\nPlot summary.\nThe Animorphs morph cockroaches in order to infiltrate a meeting of The Sharing. They discover that the Yeerks have infested an entire hospital staff and are using them to turn patients into Controllers. Not only that, but next week their state's governor \u2013 who is a potential Presidential candidate \u2013 will be checking in for surgery.\nThe Animorphs morph &lt;a href=\"houseflies\"&gt;houseflies&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate the hospital, and discover a Jacuzzi that has been converted into a miniature Yeerk Pool. Jake demorphs to human and turns the Jacuzzi on to kill the Yeerks, but the Animorphs are discovered by the Controllers. In the subsequent fight Jake is hit by a bullet ricochet and his head falls in the boiling pool. He is infested by a Yeerk named Temrash 114.\nThe Animorphs escape from the hospital into the woods, and Jake panics as he realizes that none of his friends have noticed anything different about him. Ax notices something amiss in Temrash's initial reaction to him and accuses Jake of being a Controller. Temrash loses his cool and insults Ax, calling him \"Andalite filth\" and the others realize he is indeed a Controller.\nThe others decide to hold Jake/Temrash for three days until Temrash dies of Kandrona starvation. In the meantime, Ax morphs Jake and takes his place at home and school. The others tie Jake to a chair in an abandoned shack out in the forest, but Temrash still has access to all of Jake's morphs. He morphs to tiger in the night and escapes. He becomes lost in the forest and morphs to &lt;a href=\"peregrine%20falcon\"&gt;falcon&lt;/a&gt; and tries to fly away, but Cassie stops him as a &lt;a href=\"great%20horned%20owl\"&gt;great horned owl&lt;/a&gt;.\nTemrash morphs to &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; and again tries to escape, but is stopped by the rival wolf pack from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Encounter%20%28novel%29\"&gt;The Encounter&lt;/a&gt;\". Rachel escorts him back to the shack in elephant morph.\nTemrash begins to taunt Jake, revealing that he was once the Yeerk controlling Jake's brother Tom. Jake tells him that he will never give up.\nThe next morning Temrash again tries to escape, this time as an &lt;a href=\"black%20garden%20ant\"&gt;ant&lt;/a&gt;, but is forced back by an enemy ant colony. Temrash begins to die of Kandrona starvation. As he does, Jake witnesses his pain, and in the final hours catches his first terrifying glimpse of &lt;a href=\"Crayak\"&gt;Crayak&lt;/a&gt;, though Jake does not know what this strange creature is. \nJake returns to his family to find that he has apparently been acting strangely lately, because Ax is not used to being in human morph. A few days later he morphs partway to wolf (to disguise his voice) and telephones Tom to give him a message of hope.\nTV series.\nThis book formed the basis for the episodes \"The Capture: Part 1\" and \"The Capture: Part 2\". While this followed the storyline fairly faithfully, there were still a number of changes made.\nRe-release.\nScholastic has re-released this book with a lenticular cover in March 2012."
