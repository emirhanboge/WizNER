    "text": "Henry Ossian Flipper (March 21, 1856\u00a0\u2013 April 26, 1940) was an &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20military%20history\"&gt;American soldier&lt;/a&gt;, engineer, former &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; and in 1877, the first African American to graduate from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;United States Military Academy&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"West%20Point%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;West Point&lt;/a&gt;, earning a &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;. He was also an author who wrote about scientific topics and his life experiences.\nAfter his commissioning, he was assigned to one of the all-black regiments in the U.S. Army, which were historically led by white officers. Assigned to 'A' Troop under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20M.%20Nolan\"&gt;Nicholas M. Nolan&lt;/a&gt;, he became the first nonwhite officer to lead &lt;a href=\"buffalo%20soldier\"&gt;buffalo soldier&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"10th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;10th Cavalry&lt;/a&gt;. Flipper served with competency and distinction during the &lt;a href=\"Apache%20Wars\"&gt;Apache Wars&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Victorio%27s%20War\"&gt;Victorio Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, but was haunted by rumors alleging improprieties. Eventually, he was &lt;a href=\"court-martial\"&gt;court-martial&lt;/a&gt;ed and &lt;a href=\"Military%20discharge%23Commissioned%20officers\"&gt;dismissed&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Army.\nAfter losing his commission in the Army, Flipper worked throughout Mexico and Latin America as an assistant to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior\"&gt;Secretary of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;. He retired to Atlanta in 1931 and died of natural causes in 1940.\nIn 1994, his descendants applied to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;U.S. military&lt;/a&gt; for a review of Flipper's court-martial and dismissal. A review found the conviction and punishment were \"unduly harsh and unjust\" and recommended Flipper's dismissal be changed to a &lt;a href=\"Military%20discharge%23Honorable\"&gt;good conduct discharge&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly afterwards, an application for &lt;a href=\"pardon\"&gt;pardon&lt;/a&gt; was filed with the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20the%20Army\"&gt;Secretary of the Army&lt;/a&gt;, which was forwarded to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;. President &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; posthumously &lt;a href=\"Pardoned%23United%20States\"&gt;pardoned&lt;/a&gt; Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper on February 19, 1999, 118 years after his conviction.\nEarly life and education.\nFlipper was born into &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thomasville%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Thomasville, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest of five brothers including &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Simeon%20Flipper\"&gt;Joseph Simeon&lt;/a&gt;. His mother, Isabelle Flipper, and his father, Festus Flipper, a &lt;a href=\"shoemaker\"&gt;shoemaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carriage\"&gt;carriage&lt;/a&gt;-trimmer, were owned by Ephraim G. Ponder, a wealthy &lt;a href=\"Slave%20trade\"&gt;slave dealer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlipper attended &lt;a href=\"Clark%20Atlanta%20University\"&gt;Atlanta University&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Reconstruction&lt;/a&gt;. There, as a freshman, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Representative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"James%20C.%20Freeman\"&gt;James C. Freeman&lt;/a&gt; appointed him to attend West Point, where four other black cadets were already attending. The small group had a difficult time at the academy, where they were rejected by white students. Nevertheless, Flipper persevered, and in 1877, became the first of the group to graduate, earning a commission as a &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cavalry\"&gt;cavalry&lt;/a&gt;. He was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"10th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;10th Cavalry Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, one of the four all-black \"&lt;a href=\"buffalo%20soldier\"&gt;buffalo soldier&lt;/a&gt;\" regiments in the Army, and became the first black officer to command regular troops in the U.S. Army (all-black regiments had been commanded by white officers).\n10th Cavalry Regiment.\nIn July 1877, Flipper reported to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sill\"&gt;Fort Sill&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Territory\"&gt;Indian Territory&lt;/a&gt;, for assignment with the 10th Cavalry. But the 10th was not at Fort Sill, they were at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Concho\"&gt;Fort Concho&lt;/a&gt;. He was not assigned to a cavalry troop, but given work assignments including engineering a ditch to drain a swamp that was &lt;a href=\"malaria\"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;-infested. He supervised the construction of roads and &lt;a href=\"Electrical%20telegraph\"&gt;telegraph lines&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, Flipper received orders to report to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Concho\"&gt;Fort Concho&lt;/a&gt; in West Texas in October 1877 and was assigned to 'A' Troop. He was the first nonwhite officer to lead buffalo soldiers of the 10th Cavalry.\nCaptain &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20M.%20Nolan\"&gt;Nicholas M. Nolan&lt;/a&gt;, the commander of 'A' troop, was the officer assigned to teach him about being a cavalry officer. Nolan was censured by several white officers for allowing Flipper into his quarters for dinner, where his daughter Kate was present. Nolan defended his action by stating that Flipper was an \"officer and a gentleman\" just like any other officer present.\nIn August 1878, Captain Nolan married his second wife, Anne Eleanor Dwyer, in San Antonio, Texas. They had one child, a girl. Anne's sister, Miss Mollie Dwyer, arrived shortly after Troop A moved to Fort Elliott in Texas in early 1879. Mollie Dwyer and Flipper became friends and often went riding together. Nolan was the \"&lt;a href=\"de%20facto\"&gt;de facto&lt;/a&gt;\" commander of Fort Elliott and he made Flipper his adjutant. Flipper received high marks from his commander. However, rumors and letters hinted at improprieties against Flipper, an African American and Dwyer, a Caucasian. It was the beginning of a smear campaign. During the next many months, he sent and received letters from Mollie.\nIn the fall of 1879, a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marshals%20Service\"&gt;Federal Marshal&lt;/a&gt; named Norton, armed with blank warrants, began a quarrel with a county judge. Other county officials stepped in to defend the judge and Norton arrested all of them with his armed men. Norton took the county men to Fort Elliott to be placed in the guardhouse. Nolan was required by law to accept the prisoners, and Nolan apparently talked with the &lt;a href=\"Wheeler%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Wheeler County&lt;/a&gt; Judge. The &lt;a href=\"telegraph\"&gt;telegraph&lt;/a&gt; lines then were suddenly cut and Nolan decided to act. Flipper gathered the prisoners in the middle of the night, and with two soldiers, set off for another fort in Indian Territory.\nNorton captured the entire party and arrested Flipper and one of his soldiers. The other soldier ran back to the fort to report what had happened. Norton then set off for Dallas, Texas. Nolan mounted a detail of men and took off in pursuit. He caught up to the party and made it clearly known that no prisoners would be shot while trying to escape because the federal marshal and his prisoners were now under military escort. A federal judge dismissed the warrants and Norton filed federal charges of \"interfering with the process of the law\" against the two officers. The two officers were quickly tried and found guilty. Both were fined $1,000, which was an enormous fine for its time (). Norton was satisfied, then left. The federal judge then suspended payment and dismissed the two military officers. Army relations in Wheeler County improved tremendously. Nolan had Flipper under his wing for the first part of the &lt;a href=\"Apache%20Wars\"&gt;Apache Wars&lt;/a&gt; in early 1879 until he was reassigned to G Troop. Until November 1879, during his captain's four-month leave, Flipper commanded this unit by himself and received a well done.\nIn May 1880, Flipper and Nolan reunited during the &lt;a href=\"Victorio%27s%20War\"&gt;Victorio Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. It was the last time the two met. Throughout this period, his military career was encumbered by &lt;a href=\"racism\"&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt; in the military, though he did have the support of some officers, such as Nolan, and many of the white civilians he encountered who were impressed by his competency. In the later part of 1880, Flipper was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Davis%20National%20Historic%20Site\"&gt;Fort Davis&lt;/a&gt; in West Texas and assigned as the post &lt;a href=\"quartermaster\"&gt;quartermaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commissary%23Metonymic%20use\"&gt;commissary&lt;/a&gt; officer.\nEnd of military career.\nColonel &lt;a href=\"William%20Rufus%20Shafter\"&gt;William Rufus Shafter&lt;/a&gt; assumed command at Fort Davis in March 1881. He had been the commander of the First Infantry Regiment at Fort Davis. Shafter had a reputation as harassing officers he disliked. Flipper was dismissed without cause as quartermaster within days. Then Shafter \"asked\" Flipper to keep the quartermaster's safe in his quarters. Being \"asked\" by a superior officer was a \"de facto\" order and Flipper complied. In July 1881, Flipper found a shortage of over $2,000.00 (). Realizing this could be used against him by officers intent on forcing him out of the army, he attempted to hide the discrepancy, which was later discovered, and then lied about it when confronted. In August, he was arrested by Shafter for embezzling government funds. Word quickly spread about the missing money. Many felt it was a setup and soldiers and the community came up with the money to replace what was missing within four days. Shafter accepted the money, then convened a court-martial on September 17, 1881.\nIn December 1881, the court-martial found Flipper innocent of the main charge, but another charge was added during the trial, and he was found guilty \"of conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman\", and sentenced to be \"dismissed from the service of the United States\". It was more than a harsh sentence. In two prior situations involving white officers who had been found guilty of &lt;a href=\"embezzlement\"&gt;embezzlement&lt;/a&gt;, neither officer was dismissed nor dishonored. The letters exchanged between Mollie Dwyer (Nolan's sister-in-law) and Flipper were used against Flipper. Relationships between whites and blacks were strictly forbidden in the viewpoint of the white officers on the board. Despite appeals, and with the denial of a lighter sentence from President &lt;a href=\"Chester%20A.%20Arthur\"&gt;Chester A. Arthur&lt;/a&gt;, Flipper was drummed out of the army with a &lt;a href=\"Military%20discharge%23Commissioned%20officers\"&gt;dismissal&lt;/a&gt;, the officer equivalent of a &lt;a href=\"dishonorable%20discharge\"&gt;dishonorable discharge&lt;/a&gt;, on June 30, 1882. For the rest of his life, Flipper contested the charges and fought to regain his commission.\nAfter the military.\nAfter his dismissal, Flipper remained in Texas, working as a &lt;a href=\"civil%20engineering\"&gt;civil engineer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"El%20Paso\"&gt;El Paso&lt;/a&gt;. In 1898, he volunteered to serve in the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Spanish\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt;, but requests to restore his commission were ignored by &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;. Flipper spent time in Mexico where, according to folklorist &lt;a href=\"J.%20Frank%20Dobie\"&gt;J. Frank Dobie&lt;/a&gt;, he attempted to discover the location of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Lost%20mines\"&gt;lost silver mine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tayopa\"&gt;Tayopa&lt;/a&gt;. Upon returning to the United States, he served as an adviser to Senator &lt;a href=\"Albert%20B.%20Fall\"&gt;Albert Fall&lt;/a&gt; on Mexican politics. When Senator Fall became &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior\"&gt;Secretary of the Interior&lt;/a&gt; in 1921, he brought Flipper with him to Washington, D.C., to serve as his assistant.\nIn 1923, Flipper went to work in &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"petroleum%20engineering\"&gt;engineer in the petroleum industry&lt;/a&gt;. He retired to &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; in 1931, and died in 1940. He was buried in the family plot at &lt;a href=\"South-View%20Cemetery\"&gt;South-View Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, but in February 1978 he was exhumed and reburied in his home town of Thomasville.\nLegacy.\nIn 1976, descendants and supporters applied to the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records on behalf of Flipper. The board, after stating it did not have the authority to overturn his &lt;a href=\"court-martial\"&gt;court-martial&lt;/a&gt; conviction, concluded the conviction and punishment were \"unduly harsh and unjust\" and recommended that Flipper's dismissal be changed to a good conduct discharge. The &lt;a href=\"Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Army%20%28Manpower%20and%20Reserve%20Affairs%29\"&gt;Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adjutant%20General\"&gt;Adjutant General&lt;/a&gt; approved the board's findings, conclusions, and recommendations, and directed the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20the%20Army\"&gt;Department of the Army&lt;/a&gt; to issue Flipper a Certificate of &lt;a href=\"Honorable%20Discharge\"&gt;Honorable Discharge&lt;/a&gt;, dated June 30, 1882, in lieu of his dismissal on the same date. On October 21, 1997, a private law firm, &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20%26amp%3B%20Porter\"&gt;Arnold &amp; Porter&lt;/a&gt;, filed an application of pardon with the Secretary of the Army on Flipper's behalf. Seven months later, the application was forwarded by the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) to the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20the%20Pardon%20Attorney\"&gt;Office of the Pardon Attorney&lt;/a&gt; at the Department of Justice with a recommendation that the pardon be approved. Many pardon applications had been rejected in the past \u2013 as a matter of policy \u2013 because the intended recipients were deceased. However, President &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; pardoned Flipper on February 19, 1999.\nAfter his discharge was changed, a bust of Flipper was unveiled at West Point. Since then, an annual Henry O. Flipper Award has been granted to graduating cadets at the academy who exhibit \"leadership, self-discipline, and perseverance in the face of unusual difficulties.\"\nThroughout his life, Flipper was a prolific author, writing about scientific topics, the history of the Southwest, and his own experiences. In \"The Colored Cadet at West Point\" (1878) he describes his experiences at the military academy. In the posthumous \"Negro Frontiersman: The Western Memoirs of Henry O. Flipper\" (1963), he describes his life in Texas and Arizona after his discharge from the Army.\nExternal links.\n "
