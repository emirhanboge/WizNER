    "text": "A postbus is a public &lt;a href=\"bus%20service\"&gt;bus service&lt;/a&gt; that is operated as part of local &lt;a href=\"mail%20delivery\"&gt;mail delivery&lt;/a&gt; as a means of providing &lt;a href=\"public%20transport\"&gt;public transport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"rural%20areas\"&gt;rural areas&lt;/a&gt; with lower levels of patronage, where a normal bus service would be uneconomic or inefficient. Postbus services are generally run by a &lt;a href=\"State-owned%20enterprise\"&gt;public&lt;/a&gt; postal delivery company and combine the functions of public transport and mail delivery and collection. A standard passenger fare is payable to the driver or &lt;a href=\"mail%20carrier\"&gt;mail carrier&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nHorse-driven &lt;a href=\"mail%20coach\"&gt;mail coach&lt;/a&gt; and public transport services were frequently combined prior to the advent of motorized transport. The travel writer Anthony Lambert describes the concept in Switzerland, \"the Swiss postbus system ... evolved from the 19th century mail coach service...\" and further that \"the Swiss believe ... that the only sensible way to organise public transport services is to achieve the maximum integration between modes.\" The service became used widely in Europe by the 1960s, though in recent years there has been a progressive separation of services in some countries.\nBy country.\nAustria.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, the postbus system is known as . From 1907 onwards power-driven vehicles were operated by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial-Royal\"&gt;Imperial-Royal&lt;/a&gt; \"Post- und Telegraphenverwaltung\", gradually replacing the former &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; service. In the course of the privatisation of the &lt;a href=\"%C3%96sterreichische%20Post\"&gt;\u00d6sterreichische Post&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"%C3%96sterreichische%20Industrieholding\"&gt;\u00d6sterreichische Industrieholding&lt;/a&gt; sold the postbus branch to the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Federal%20Railways\"&gt;Austrian Federal Railways&lt;/a&gt; (\u00d6BB) group in 2003.\nToday the \u00d6BB-Postbus GmbH is the country's largest bus company serving regional and interurban traffic with about 4000 employees and 2100 buses. The corporation also comprises the \u00d6BB's former railway bus service (K\u00d6B) as well as the Czech \u010cSAD Autobusy company in &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cesk%C3%A9%20Bud%C4%9Bjovice\"&gt;\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice&lt;/a&gt; acquired in 2004.\nCzechoslovakia.\nThe first postbus lines in &lt;a href=\"Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; started in the days of &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, in 1908. The first lines were &lt;a href=\"Pardubice\"&gt;Pardubice&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Bohdane%C4%8D\"&gt;Bohdane\u010d&lt;/a&gt; (11\u00a0km, 64 minutes) and &lt;a href=\"Pardubice\"&gt;Pardubice&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Holice%20%28Pardubice%20District%29\"&gt;Holice&lt;/a&gt;, other lines came later. In 1914, bus transport in Bohemia, &lt;a href=\"Moravia\"&gt;Moravia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; consisted of 23 lines in all, at which operated 33 postbuses and 13 private buses. During the World War I, bus transport was interrupted, vehicles were requisitioned by the army and rebuild to trucks.\nSince 1918, postbus transport continued in &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;. The post transport had its main base place at Citadela, a former army depot in &lt;a href=\"Vy%C5%A1ehrad\"&gt;Vy\u0161ehrad&lt;/a&gt;, Prague, and in 1926 it had 216 buses in the whole Czechoslovakia. In 1927, the Citadela base with many equipment and material was burned by fire. The second main base place was built in &lt;a href=\"Vr%C5%A1ovice\"&gt;Vr\u0161ovice&lt;/a&gt;, Prague (currently &lt;a href=\"Veolia%20Transport\"&gt;Veolia Transport&lt;/a&gt; resides there). In 1927 the Czechoslovak state railway company &lt;a href=\"%C4%8CSD\"&gt;\u010cSD&lt;/a&gt; began its state bus lines but the post lines continued. In 1933\u20131934 state postbus lines were transferred and merged with railway bus lines into \u010cSD railway company.\nFinland.\nIn 1921, The Finnish Post and Telegraph Authority (Posti- ja lenn\u00e4tinlaitos, now &lt;a href=\"Itella\"&gt;Itella&lt;/a&gt; Corporation) started a bus service carrying both mail and passengers in &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Lapland\"&gt;Finnish Lapland&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Rovaniemi\"&gt;Rovaniemi&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sodankyl%C3%A4\"&gt;Sodankyl\u00e4&lt;/a&gt; and soon all the way to &lt;a href=\"Ivalo\"&gt;Ivalo&lt;/a&gt; in the very northern part of the country. The same year, another postbus route was started in southwestern Finland between &lt;a href=\"Turku\"&gt;Turku&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Myn%C3%A4m%C3%A4ki\"&gt;Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki&lt;/a&gt; and in 1922 a third service began between the northern city &lt;a href=\"Oulu\"&gt;Oulu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taivalkoski\"&gt;Taivalkoski&lt;/a&gt;. By 1939 there were over 60 postbus routes around Finland. In addition to that, many private bus companies also carried mail on their buses.\nThe busiest year for the Finnish Postbus network was 1971, with 222 bus lines around the country run by more than 420 buses famous for their bright orange colour. Then the posts authority decided to concentrate postal transports on trucks, and the postbus services started to decline. In 1999, the remaining postbus lines and vehicles, now organised under a separate company Gold Line Oy, were sold to a private bus company, Koiviston Auto Oy. Gold Line remains Koivisto's subsidiary operating from Rovaniemi.\nGermany.\nIn Germany, a postbus system for passenger and freight operation, run by the &lt;a href=\"Reichspost\"&gt;Reichspost&lt;/a&gt; authority and its post-war &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Bundespost\"&gt;Bundespost&lt;/a&gt; successor, existed until May 1985. It was formerly known as \"\", from 1965 as \"Postreisedienst\".\nA first postbus route was set up on 1 June 1905 connecting &lt;a href=\"Bad%20T%C3%B6lz\"&gt;Bad T\u00f6lz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lenggries\"&gt;Lenggries&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;. The first Reichspost line ran from 16 June 1906 between &lt;a href=\"Friedberg%2C%20Hesse\"&gt;Friedberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ranstadt\"&gt;Ranstadt&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Hesse\"&gt;Hesse&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after it operated numerous bus routes. With mailboxes on board, the buses contributed greatly to open up rural areas in the 1920s and 30s in addition to the &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Reichsbahn\"&gt;Reichsbahn&lt;/a&gt; railway lines. While rail was quicker and more convenient, the buses were a low-cost alternative.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, post bus service was resumed by the Bundespost authority in &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt;, running more than 4,000 vehicles in the mid-1950s. Later years saw a significant decline in demand, with the increasing prosperity of society in the \"&lt;a href=\"Wirtschaftswunder\"&gt;Wirtschaftswunder&lt;/a&gt;\" period and the growing use of the automobile for &lt;a href=\"private%20transport\"&gt;private transport&lt;/a&gt;. Many lines were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.\nIn 1971, the Bundespost agreed to build up a &lt;a href=\"joint%20venture\"&gt;joint venture&lt;/a&gt; cooperation with the &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Bundesbahn\"&gt;Bundesbahn&lt;/a&gt; rail bus network and from 1981, the service was split into regional transport companies under the umbrella of the Bundesbahn authority, running bus lines in major cities and metropolitan areas associated with each other. By 1995, the newly established Bundespost successor, the privatized &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Post\"&gt;Deutsche Post&lt;/a&gt; stock company, had retired completely from bus service and the yellow vehicles disappeared from public roads. However, there are foreign postbuses in Germany with international scheduled services (e.g. from Austria in the &lt;a href=\"Berchtesgadener%20Land\"&gt;Berchtesgadener Land&lt;/a&gt; area and in &lt;a href=\"Oberstdorf\"&gt;Oberstdorf&lt;/a&gt;; from Switzerland in southern &lt;a href=\"Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg\"&gt;Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn 2013, after a substantial &lt;a href=\"liberalization\"&gt;liberalization&lt;/a&gt; of the German &lt;a href=\"intercity%20bus%20service\"&gt;intercity bus&lt;/a&gt; market, Deutsche Post created a \"Deutsche Post Mobility\" subsidiary. Initially run in cooperation with the &lt;a href=\"ADAC\"&gt;ADAC&lt;/a&gt; automobile club it was first branded \"ADAC Postbus\". It connected several large cities nationally and internationally. Deutsche Post DHL Group sold its long-distance bus unit, Postbus, to the German market leader &lt;a href=\"Flixbus\"&gt;Flixbus&lt;/a&gt; on 3 August 2016.\nIreland.\nIn July 1982, the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20for%20Posts%20and%20Telegraphs\"&gt;Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Wilson%20%28Irish%20politician%29\"&gt;John Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, initiated a postbus service in &lt;a href=\"County%20Clare\"&gt;County Clare&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most scenic areas of &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ennis\"&gt;Ennis&lt;/a&gt; post office was the start of the 68-mile route around the county. It ran twice on weekdays at 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. carrying mail and passengers to towns like &lt;a href=\"Kilfenora\"&gt;Kilfenora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lisdoonvarna\"&gt;Lisdoonvarna&lt;/a&gt; with the postman-cum-driver. The bus was originally in an orange and black livery but in 1984 changed to a green livery when &lt;a href=\"An%20Post\"&gt;An Post&lt;/a&gt; became a state-owned postal service provider instead of being an &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Irish government&lt;/a&gt; department.\nPassengers were accommodated on a first come first served basis in the small bus and paid an average fee of \u00a35. Soon after its introduction tourists discovered the postbus that took them through the breath-taking County Clare scenery to visit &lt;a href=\"The%20Burren\"&gt;The Burren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cliffs%20of%20Moher\"&gt;Cliffs of Moher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe postbus service was terminated in September 2004 and was never extended to other parts of the country. An Post axed the service for economic reason and claimed the bus was too old and beyond repair. Clare council member, Martin Lafferty, accused An Post of allowing the service to deteriorate so they could axe it.\nSweden.\nIn some parts of rural Sweden, especially the sparsely populated northern inland, mail is delivered by bus. Formerly this service was handled by the &lt;a href=\"Posten%20%28Sweden%29\"&gt;postal service&lt;/a&gt; themselves in their own buses and &lt;a href=\"livery\"&gt;livery&lt;/a&gt;. As Postens Diligenstrafik (lit. the Post's &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; traffic) between the years 1923\u20131991. In 1991 this became a part of the &lt;a href=\"Swebus%20AB\"&gt;Swebus&lt;/a&gt; company. Nowadays it is handled by the &lt;a href=\"County%20Councils%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;local councils\u2019&lt;/a&gt; own &lt;a href=\"public%20transportation\"&gt;public transportation&lt;/a&gt; buses by appointment of the postal service. Due to &lt;a href=\"deregulation\"&gt;deregulation&lt;/a&gt; since the early 1990s, some lines are run as &lt;a href=\"public%20service%20obligation\"&gt;public service obligation&lt;/a&gt;s by private contractors. In addition to that there is an association of local bus companies called \"Bussgods\" which works as a &lt;a href=\"courier\"&gt;courier&lt;/a&gt; for bulkier goods between &lt;a href=\"bus%20stop\"&gt;bus stop&lt;/a&gt;s and/or &lt;a href=\"Bus%20terminus\"&gt;terminals&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the British postbuses these vehicles are built on full-size &lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;coaches&lt;/a&gt; chassis with a &lt;a href=\"Box%20truck\"&gt;box body&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"tail%20lift\"&gt;tail lift&lt;/a&gt; in the rear end to accommodate heavier goods and even &lt;a href=\"pallet\"&gt;pallet&lt;/a&gt;s sent along with the mail. This unusual truck/bus combination is nicknamed \"&lt;a href=\"Skvader\"&gt;Skvader&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSwitzerland.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the postbus system is known as \"Postauto\" in German, \"Car postal\" in French and \"Autopostale\" in Italian. Although the combination of mail and passenger transportation had been self-evident in the past, the needs of each diverged towards the end of the twentieth century, when the conveyance of parcels was progressively separated from public transportation. This was also so on private bus and rail lines. This division became official with the conversion of Swiss PostBus Ltd into an independent subsidiary of the &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Post\"&gt;Swiss Post&lt;/a&gt;. The company operates 869 bus lines with 2,193 buses in Switzerland, transporting over 140 million passengers annually on its 11,869\u00a0km long network.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom postbus services by &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Mail\"&gt;Royal Mail&lt;/a&gt; began in 1967 to replace rapidly declining local bus and rail services in rural areas and provide a community service. In 2006 more than 200 services were operated by Royal Mail, often only once or twice a day but in some areas the only form of public transport available. Key areas included the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Dales\"&gt;Yorkshire Dales&lt;/a&gt; and South West Scotland.\nIn April 2009 the Royal Mail ended its postbus services in much of the &lt;a href=\"Highlands%20and%20Islands\"&gt;Scottish Highlands and Islands&lt;/a&gt; region. Five \"unprofitable\" routes were cancelled. The move proved very unpopular with campaigners. Discussions between the Highland Council and Royal Mail broke down after the Royal Mail refused to respond to the Highland Council's emails. The services were subsequently replaced by a service operated by the &lt;a href=\"Stagecoach%20Group\"&gt;Stagecoach Group&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter March 2016 only one postbus remained in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, route 134 from &lt;a href=\"Tongue%2C%20Highland\"&gt;Tongue&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lairg\"&gt;Lairg&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Highlands\"&gt;Scottish Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and this last ran on 19 August 2017.\nIreland.\nBetween 1982 and 2004 &lt;a href=\"An%20Post\"&gt;An Post&lt;/a&gt; operated a 70-mile postbus route linking &lt;a href=\"Ennis\"&gt;Ennis&lt;/a&gt; with parts of &lt;a href=\"County%20Clare\"&gt;County Clare&lt;/a&gt;. It was introduced as an experimental service that was to be extended to other parts of the country though other routes were never opened. Tourists were the main users of the service. Upon termination the company were accused of letting the bus become run down so they could abolish the service."
