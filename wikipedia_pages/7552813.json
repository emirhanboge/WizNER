Once land was sighted, the high-seat pillars were thrown overboard, and a permanent farm was established where the pillars washed ashore. The first farm established in Iceland, located where the capital, &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;, stands today, was allegedly founded using this method.\nOne saga refers to a high-seat pillar having been carved with an image of the god &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sagas%20of%20Icelanders\"&gt;Icelandic saga&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Eyrbyggja%20saga\"&gt;Eyrbyggja saga&lt;/a&gt;\" relates that when \u00de\u00f3r\u00f3lfur Mostrarskegg (Thorolf Most-Beard) constructed a temple after reaching Iceland, the high seat pillars had &lt;a href=\"reginnaglar\"&gt;reginnaglar&lt;/a&gt; (Old Icelandic \"god-nails\" or \"power-nails\") in them. Otherwise very little is known about what they might have looked like."
