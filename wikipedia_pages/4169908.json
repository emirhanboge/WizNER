    "text": "The Choegowi (; literally \"Top Position\") was a &lt;a href=\"Go%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; competition that ran from 1959 to 1997. The preliminary stages were 8-player knockout rounds, with the players who won the preliminary split into two sections. The winners of those sections played a best-of-three match to decide who would challenge the holder of the title. The final was played in a best-of-five format. The thinking time was 5 hours, and &lt;a href=\"Komidashi\"&gt;komi&lt;/a&gt; was 5.5 points."
