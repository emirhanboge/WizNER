Prior to coming to Kew in 1964, he was associated with the East African Herbarium for 15 years. Although his best-known work probably consists of his many studies of the East African &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt;, he has also made extensive contributions relating to African terrestrial &lt;a href=\"Mollusca\"&gt;mollusks&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=\"entomology\"&gt;entomology&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Verdcourt received the Linnean Medal for botany from the &lt;a href=\"Linnean%20Society%20of%20London\"&gt;Linnean Society of London&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. His list of publications includes more than 1,000 &lt;a href=\"Scientific%20literature\"&gt;scientific works&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 2012, botanists H.Ohashi &amp; K.Ohashi published \"&lt;a href=\"Verdesmum\"&gt;Verdesmum&lt;/a&gt;\" is a &lt;a href=\"monotypic%20genus\"&gt;monotypic genus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt;s from Malasia belonging to the family &lt;a href=\"Fabaceae\"&gt;Fabaceae&lt;/a&gt;, it was named in Bernard Verdcourt's honour."
