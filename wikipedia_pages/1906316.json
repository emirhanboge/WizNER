    "text": "Leo Slezak (; 18 August 1873 \u2013 1 June 1946) was a world-famous &lt;a href=\"Moravia\"&gt;Moravia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt;. He was associated in particular with &lt;a href=\"Music%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; as well as the title role in &lt;a href=\"Verdi\"&gt;Verdi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Otello\"&gt;Otello&lt;/a&gt;\". He is the father of actors &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Slezak\"&gt;Walter Slezak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Margarete%20Slezak\"&gt;Margarete Slezak&lt;/a&gt; and grandfather of the actress &lt;a href=\"Erika%20Slezak\"&gt;Erika Slezak&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife and work.\nEarly years.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0umperk\"&gt;\u0160umperk&lt;/a&gt; (M\u00e4hrisch-Sch\u00f6nberg), the son of a miller, Slezak worked briefly as a blacksmith, an engineer's fitter and served in the army before taking singing lessons with the first-class baritone and pedagogue &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Robinson\"&gt;Adolf Robinson&lt;/a&gt;. He made his debut in 1896 in &lt;a href=\"Brno\"&gt;Brno&lt;/a&gt; (Br\u00fcnn) and proceeded to sing leading roles in &lt;a href=\"Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; and Germany, appearing at &lt;a href=\"Breslau\"&gt;Breslau&lt;/a&gt; and, in 1898\u201399, at &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. From 1901 onwards he was a permanent member of the &lt;a href=\"Vienna%20State%20Opera\"&gt;Vienna State Opera&lt;/a&gt;'s roster of artists, achieving star status. While in Vienna he was initiated into &lt;a href=\"Freemasonry\"&gt;Freemasonry&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nSlezak's international career commenced in London at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Royal Opera House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Covent%20Garden\"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt;, where he sang &lt;a href=\"Siegfried%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Siegfried&lt;/a&gt; (a punishing role that he would soon drop from his repertoire) and &lt;a href=\"Lohengrin%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Lohengrin&lt;/a&gt; in 1900. (He would return to Covent Garden in 1909 after undertaking further vocal studies in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; the previous year with a great tenor of a previous era, &lt;a href=\"Jean%20de%20Reszke\"&gt;Jean de Reszke&lt;/a&gt;.)\nSlezak secured a three-year contract with the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt; in 1909. Met audiences acclaimed him in performances of works by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Wagner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Verdi\"&gt;Verdi&lt;/a&gt;. Along with Italy's &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Zenatello\"&gt;Giovanni Zenatello&lt;/a&gt;, he became the most famous Otello of his generation, famously performing the role at the Met with &lt;a href=\"Arturo%20Toscanini\"&gt;Arturo Toscanini&lt;/a&gt; conducting.\nHe was a convivial person, and many anecdotes reveal his amiable sense of humour. The best-known example is as follows: during a performance of Wagner's \"&lt;a href=\"Lohengrin%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Lohengrin&lt;/a&gt;\", a stage hand pulled the swan off the stage too early, before the tenor could hop aboard. Seeing his feathered transportation disappear into the wings, Slezak ad-libbed to the audience: \"Wann f\u00e4hrt der n\u00e4chste Schwan?\" (\"When does the next swan leave?\").\nSlezak had a versatile repertory which embraced 66 roles. They included notably &lt;a href=\"Rossini\"&gt;Rossini&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"William%20Tell%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Guillaume Tell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Il%20trovatore\"&gt;Manrico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aida\"&gt;Radames&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Die%20Meistersinger%20von%20N%C3%BCrnberg\"&gt;Walter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tannh%C3%A4user%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Tannh\u00e4user&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Queen%20of%20Spades%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Hermann&lt;/a&gt; and, as we have seen, Otello and Lohengrin. He sang 44 roles in Vienna alone, where he chalked up 936 appearances in 1901\u201312 and 1917\u201327 and became an idol of audiences.\nVocal characteristics.\nA tall barrel-chested man, Slezak possessed a large and attractive lyric-dramatic voice which enabled him to undertake all but the very heaviest Wagnerian parts such as Tristan or Parsifal. He had a distinctive tonal quality, too, which became markedly darker after his studies with de Reszke in 1908. Slezak was a master of \"mezza-voce\" singing and he could also deliver haunting head notes. Unfortunately, with time and hard use, his top register developed a strained and unsteady quality when used at full volume, as can be heard on some of his recordings.\nHe made hundreds of disc and cylinder recordings, beginning in the early 1900s and ending in the 1930s. They were produced by several different record companies and include arias, duets and songs by a wide selection of composers, ranging from &lt;a href=\"Mozart\"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt; to Wagner. Most of his best records have been released on CD compilations. Some of his film work as an actor survives, too.\nBooks.\nSlezak's autobiography, published in 1938 in English as \"Song of Motley: Being the Reminiscences of a Hungry Tenor\", contains pen-portraits of many of the musicians and artists with whom he worked, including &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Mahler\"&gt;Gustav Mahler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arturo%20Toscanini\"&gt;Arturo Toscanini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cosima%20Wagner\"&gt;Cosima Wagner&lt;/a&gt;. It describes his tours of America, Russia and the Balkans and recalls his doomed audition for Frau Wagner at &lt;a href=\"Bayreuth\"&gt;Bayreuth&lt;/a&gt;, when he foolishly chose to sing music from \"&lt;a href=\"Pagliacci\"&gt;Pagliacci&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLater in life, he published several very humorous, semi-autobiographical books, notably:\nFilms.\nIn 1932, Slezak began appearing in German cinema. As an actor/&lt;a href=\"comedian\"&gt;comedian&lt;/a&gt;, he played humorous characters, but mostly he sang. His movies included \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Paloma\"&gt;La Paloma&lt;/a&gt;\" (1934) and \"&lt;a href=\"Gasparone\"&gt;Gasparone&lt;/a&gt;\" (1937). Slezak's final film role was as a portly sultan in the 1943 &lt;a href=\"Universum%20Film%20AG\"&gt;UFA&lt;/a&gt; prestige production \"&lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCnchhausen%20%281943%20film%29\"&gt;M\u00fcnchhausen&lt;/a&gt;\". His son, &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Slezak\"&gt;Walter Slezak&lt;/a&gt;, who started off in &lt;a href=\"musical%20theater\"&gt;musical theater&lt;/a&gt;, became a successful character actor in &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; during the 1940s. His granddaughter (Walter's daughter) is the actress &lt;a href=\"Erika%20Slezak\"&gt;Erika Slezak&lt;/a&gt;, noted for her role on the &lt;a href=\"soap%20opera\"&gt;soap opera&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"One%20Life%20to%20Live\"&gt;One Life to Live&lt;/a&gt;\"."
