    "text": "Florence Rock () is a rock long with a smaller rock off its northeast end, lying southwest of &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Anderson\"&gt;Cape Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, off the south coast of &lt;a href=\"Laurie%20Island\"&gt;Laurie Island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Orkney%20Islands\"&gt;South Orkney Islands&lt;/a&gt;. It was charted and named by the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20National%20Antarctic%20Expedition\"&gt;Scottish National Antarctic Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, 1902\u201304, led by &lt;a href=\"W.S.%20Bruce\"&gt;W.S. Bruce&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is probable that Bruce named Florence Rock after &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Florence\"&gt;Edwin Florence&lt;/a&gt;, chief cook on the expedition ship the \"Scotia\", who was promoted to first steward in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; in January 1904."
