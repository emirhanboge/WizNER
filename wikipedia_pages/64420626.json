    "text": "This is the &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20Finland\"&gt;history of Finland&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"1917\"&gt;1917&lt;/a&gt; onwards.\nIndependence.\nFinnish nationalism started growing in the 19th century alongside European &lt;a href=\"Nationalism\"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; movements. &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Ludvig%20Runeberg\"&gt;Runeberg's&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tales%20of%20Ensign%20St%C3%A5l\"&gt;The Tales of Ensign St\u00e5l&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Elias%20L%C3%B6nnrot\"&gt;L\u00f6nnrot's&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Kalevala\"&gt;Kalevala&lt;/a&gt;\" formed a basis for the nation's cultural identity.\n&lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and internal problems caused a &lt;a href=\"February%20Revolution\"&gt;revolution in Russia&lt;/a&gt; in 1917. Finland took advantage of the situation and began to explore the possibilities for greater autonomy or even independence. The &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Provisional%20Government\"&gt;Russian Provisional Government&lt;/a&gt; responded negatively to the independence project, and suggested that a decision could only be made once the constitutional convention would convene.\nFollowing the defeat of the Provisional Government in the &lt;a href=\"Bolsheviks\"&gt;Bolshevik&lt;/a&gt; led &lt;a href=\"October%20Revolution\"&gt;October Revolution&lt;/a&gt; of November 1917, Finland's political class was divided on how to approach independence. The right wanted to seek recognition for independence from the West, while the left wanted to first be recognized by the new Bolshevik government.\n&lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Finland\"&gt;The Parliament&lt;/a&gt; convened on December 6 &lt;a href=\"1917\"&gt;1917&lt;/a&gt; and approved of right-led &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Finland\"&gt;senate&lt;/a&gt;'s (the functional government at the time) &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Declaration%20of%20Independence\"&gt;declaration of independence&lt;/a&gt;. Russia officially recognized Finland on January 4, 1918 as did &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; ja &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; gave recognition on 6 January, 1918.\nCivil War.\nAs part of the &lt;a href=\"aftermath%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;aftermath of World War I&lt;/a&gt;, Finland had a &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;. The war took place between the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Finland\"&gt;Finnish Senate&lt;/a&gt; (the government) and the forces led by the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20People%27s%20Delegation\"&gt;Finnish People's Delegation&lt;/a&gt;, on 27 January to 16 May 1918. The Senate troops were called &lt;a href=\"Whites%20%28Finland%29\"&gt;whites&lt;/a&gt;, while the people's delegation's forces were named reds. World War I had caused the fragmentation of the Russian Empire through the internal disintegration, leading to a struggle for power in Finland whose political system was in transition from to the &lt;a href=\"Parliamentary%20system\"&gt;parliamentarian system&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, society was socially and economically divided. The main consequence of this division was the formation of two armed centers of power in the country. The crisis then culminated in a war between them in January 1918. The Whites won the war with the support of &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The Reds backed by &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Soviet Russia&lt;/a&gt; lost the war. As a result, Finland moved from the Russian domain to the German &lt;a href=\"sphere%20of%20influence\"&gt;sphere of influence&lt;/a&gt;. After Germany's defeat in WWI, the independence of the Finnish nation was confirmed and the country's government was to become a republican democracy. While the civil war was characterized by political terror, it was only after the war that the greatest loss of life was experienced in prison camps, where about 13,000 reds died. The Civil War claimed a total of about 37,000 victims, of which about 75% were Finnish reds. The other victims were Finnish whites, Germans and Russians. From a psychological and material point of view, the Civil War was the most destructive event in the history of the Finnish nation, traumatizing the population and splitting it in two. However, as a result of the outcome of the First World War, the moderate left and the right were able to establish, shortly after the Civil War, the cooperation that united the Finns over time.\nThe early life of independent Finland.\nAfter the Civil War, Finland's form of government was to be a monarchy. Friedrich Karl had already been elected king of Finland, but the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Finland%20%281918%29\"&gt;kingdom project&lt;/a&gt; was over when Germany lost in The First World War. Finland then became a republic whose government was confirmed on 17 July, 1919. Shortly thereafter, &lt;a href=\"Kaarlo%20Juho%20St%C3%A5hlberg\"&gt;K.J. St\u00e5hlberg&lt;/a&gt; was elected &lt;a href=\"president%20of%20Finland\"&gt;president of Finland&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1920 Finland signed a &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Tartu%20%28Russian%E2%80%93Finnish%29\"&gt;peace and border agreement with Soviet Russia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tartu\"&gt;Tartu&lt;/a&gt;, Estonia. For the first time, the treaty defined the boundaries of an independent Finland, which were based on the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Finland\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Finland&lt;/a&gt;. The inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Repola\"&gt;Repola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porosozero\"&gt;Poraj\u00e4rvi&lt;/a&gt; had demanded that the municipalities be annexed to Finland and in practice they had already been controlled by Finland, but the peace agreement restored them to Russia. However, Finland received the &lt;a href=\"Pechenga%20%28river%29\"&gt;Pechenga&lt;/a&gt; region from Russia.\nRelations with Soviet Russia since 1922 onwards were also burdened by the question of &lt;a href=\"East%20Karelia\"&gt;East Karelia&lt;/a&gt;. Finland wanted greater autonomy, citing the relevant provisions of the Tartu Peace Agreement, but the Soviet Union considered that nominal autonomy was sufficient. The &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Nations\"&gt;League of Nations&lt;/a&gt; said it was an internal matter of the Soviet Union and did not intervene despite Finland's requests.\nAnother problem was the status of &lt;a href=\"%C3%85land\"&gt;\u00c5land&lt;/a&gt;, which Sweden had occupied during the Finnish Civil War. The \u00c5land people wanted to join Sweden, but this claim was strictly rejected. In 1921, the League of Nations finally resolved the question according to Finland's wishes.\nIn 1932, Finland's security problem was tried to be resolved with a defense union with Estonia, Latvia and Poland, but the Parliament did not ratify the treaty, and in 1932 a non-aggression pact was concluded between Finland and the Soviet Union. In the second half of the 1930s, a defense alliance was also planned between Finland and Sweden, which also failed in the resistance of the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, efforts were made to resolve the structural conflicts that had long plagued Finland. Language disputes between the Swedish and Finnish-speaking sections of the population were successfully put to an end by language legislation.\nIn 1918, 70% of the population made a living from agriculture and forestry. The land reforms of 1919 and 1922 improved the situation of rural &lt;a href=\"Sharecropping\"&gt;sharecroppers&lt;/a&gt; and farm workers. A total of 126,000 holdings were redeemed as independents.\nDuring St\u00e5hlberg's presidency in 1919\u20131925, the right wing and centrist groups were in power. The longest prison sentences following the Civil War were pardoned. The Finnish Social Democratic Party reorganized under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4in%C3%B6%20Tanner\"&gt;V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner&lt;/a&gt;, and after forming a minority government in 1926, gave general amnesty.\nSt\u00e5hlberg deliberately pursued a strong unification policy to reduce the gap caused by the Civil War. During his time, the country underwent numerous social reforms in legislation and taxation, which increased equality and improved living standards.\nIn August 1918, the most radical Social Democrats fled to Russia at the end of the Civil War and founded the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Finland\"&gt;Finnish Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; (SKP), which was not allowed to operate legally in Finland. Thus, the SKP and its allies established the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20of%20Finland\"&gt;Socialist Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; as their legal form, which received 27 seats in the 1922 elections. However, the police arrested all its of MPs on charges of treason and banned the party in 1923. With the growth of communism, the fascist &lt;a href=\"Lapua%20Movement\"&gt;Lapua movement&lt;/a&gt;, which from 1929 to 1932 acted against communist newspapers, organized mass demonstrations and terrorized individual citizens. The communists were prevented from taking part in the 1930 elections and their activities in all forms were banned. The anti-communist laws restricted freedom of printing, association and assembly.\nSvinhufvud was elected as president in 1931 with the support of the Lapua. Soon the movement turned against the Social Democrats, and after an attempted coup in 1932 known as the &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A4nts%C3%A4l%C3%A4%20rebellion\"&gt;M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the president intervened and, with his radio speech, brought the rebellion to an end. There was also an economic shortage in the same years.\nA major failure was the Prohibition Act of 1919-1932, which led to an increase in the number and severity of crime and significantly increased alcohol consumption. Prohibition was abolished only after the referendum in 1932.\nWorld War II.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, Finland fought three wars: the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20War\"&gt;Winter War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Continuation%20War\"&gt;Continuation War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lapland%20War\"&gt;Lapland War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe secret protocol to the &lt;a href=\"Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact\"&gt;Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact&lt;/a&gt; between the Soviet Union and Germany of August 1939 defined Finland as part of the Soviet Union's sphere of interest. In the autumn of 1939, the Soviet Union called for negotiations to secure Leningrad and demanded Finland's territory from the &lt;a href=\"Karelian%20Isthmus\"&gt;Karelian Isthmus&lt;/a&gt;, a base in Hanko and the outer islands of the Gulf of Finland. According to official Soviet propaganda, these areal losses would have been replaced by exchanging them for regions of Eastern Karelia (&lt;a href=\"Porosozero\"&gt;Poraj\u00e4rvi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Repola\"&gt;Repola&lt;/a&gt;).\nFollowing the interrupted negotiations, the Soviet Union invaded Finland on 30 November 1939 after the &lt;a href=\"Shelling%20of%20Mainila\"&gt;Shelling of Mainila&lt;/a&gt;, and the Winter War began. Despite the many victories, the defense of the Karelian Isthmus was about to break, forcing the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Peace%20Treaty\"&gt;Peace of Moscow&lt;/a&gt; on 13 May 1940, in which Finland had to hand over the Parts of &lt;a href=\"Karelia\"&gt;Karelia&lt;/a&gt;, the outer islands of the Gulf of Finland and the eastern parts of &lt;a href=\"Kuusamo\"&gt;Kuusamo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salla\"&gt;Salla&lt;/a&gt;, as well as parts of Pechenga, and finally rent a military base at &lt;a href=\"Hanko%2C%20Finland\"&gt;Hanko&lt;/a&gt; to the Soviet Union for 30 years.\nThe planning of the Nordic Defence Union continued after the end of the Winter War. However, the project failed again.\nAfter the attack on the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany, Finland joined it in June 1941 with the aim of at least recovering the released territories. While this was the case at first, in addition a large part of &lt;a href=\"East%20Karelia\"&gt;East Karelia&lt;/a&gt; was occupied in an effort to create a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Finland\"&gt;Greater Finland&lt;/a&gt;. The Continuation War ended in the summer of 1944 with new territorial losses. According to the truce of 19 September 1944, the Germans had to be driven from the country. Following this, the Lapland War was waged against the former ally Germany in Lapland, ending on 27 April, 1945. German troops destroyed large areas of Lapland as they retreated.\nAccording to the Truce Treaty, Finland had to hand over &lt;a href=\"Petsamo%20Province\"&gt;Petsamo&lt;/a&gt; and rent &lt;a href=\"Porkkala%20Naval%20Base\"&gt;Porkkala&lt;/a&gt; as a base for 50 years, in addition to the territorial losses that had followed the Winter War. The war reparations were set at $300 million. The terms of the Truce Agreement were definitively laid down in the Treaty of Paris in 1947.\nNeutral Finland.\nAfter World War II, Finland was in the grey zone between the West and the Soviet Union. The 1948 agreement between Finland and the Soviet Union on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance, 'the YYA Agreement', attached Finland militarily to the same camp as the Soviet Union, although Finland officially declared that it was an impartial state. The agreement was extended in 1955, 1970 and 1983. Many politicians used Soviet relations to settle party political disputes, which naturally led to an increase in Soviet influence. Others worked resolutely to resist the influence of the Soviet Union.\nAfter the war reparations were paid, trade with the Soviet Union continued and was as high as 25% of foreign trade in the 1980s. In 1956, the Soviet Union gave up Porkkala's base prematurely. The 50-year contract was not originally due to end until 1994. In 1956, Urho Kekkonen was elected president.\nThe Soviet Union is considered to have tried on several occasions to intervene indirectly or otherwise by exerting pressure on Finland's domestic political situation and government decisions, such as during the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Frost%20Crisis\"&gt;night frost crisis&lt;/a&gt; of 1958 and the October 1961 &lt;a href=\"Note%20Crisis\"&gt;note crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;, Finland also developed into one of the centers of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War%20espionage\"&gt;East-West espionage&lt;/a&gt;, in which both the &lt;a href=\"KGB\"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"CIA\"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; played their parts.\nFrom the late 1960s to the early 1980s, the so-called &lt;a href=\"Taistoism\"&gt;Taistoism&lt;/a&gt; movement, the pro-Soviet minority of the SKP and the extreme left, admired the Soviet Union visibly in the fields of culture and media.\nAt the beginning of 1973, Kekkonen was made president without elections and opponents by the Parliament, which some now regard as the trough of a &lt;a href=\"democratic%20deficit\"&gt;democratic deficit&lt;/a&gt;. Contrary to today, at that time the President had a great deal of power in Finland and could, if he so wished, dissolve parliament and the government almost arbitrarily.\nIn 1973, Finland concluded the &lt;a href=\"European%20Economic%20Community\"&gt;EEC&lt;/a&gt; free trade agreement with Western European countries. The EEC agreement was opposed by a full-page announcement published in &lt;a href=\"Helsingin%20Sanomat\"&gt;Helsingin Sanomat&lt;/a&gt;, signed by many well-known politicians.\nIn 1975, the &lt;a href=\"Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe\"&gt;OSCE&lt;/a&gt; conference was held in Helsinki, which not only strengthened Kekkonen's and Finland's neutrality in the eyes of the West, but also sowed the seeds of the disintegration of the communist governments of Eastern Europe when the so-called &lt;a href=\"International%20Helsinki%20Federation%20for%20Human%20Rights\"&gt;Helsinki groups&lt;/a&gt; were founded by local opposition forces, inspired by the human rights section of the convention.\nUrho Kekkonen resigned from his office as president at the end of 1981 due to illness. He served as president for more than 25 years, much longer than any other president. In 1982, &lt;a href=\"Mauno%20Koivisto\"&gt;Mauno Koivisto&lt;/a&gt; was elected president, who wanted to reduce the president's power and increase the prime minister's rights.\nIt was not until 1989 when Mikhail Gorbachev visited Finland that the Soviet Union explicitly recognized Finland as an neutral country.\nFinland in an integrated Europe.\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 came as a complete surprise to Finland, but was immediately taken advantage of. Finland unilaterally rejected the military aspects of the Paris peace agreement, except for border agreements. In 1992, Finland and Russia replaced the so-called \"YYA\" agreement.\nIn 1991, as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20banking%20crisis%20of%201990s\"&gt;banking crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the collapse of Soviet export trade, the Finnish economy began its dive into its deepest recession since the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; of the 1930s (see &lt;a href=\"Early%201990s%20recession%20in%20Finland\"&gt;depression in Finland in the early 1990s&lt;/a&gt;). In a few years, 450 000 jobs disappeared, and unemployment rose to 16%. It was not until 1994 that GDP growth re-emerged.\nIn autumn 1989, the convergence of Finland and the &lt;a href=\"European%20Economic%20Community\"&gt;European Community&lt;/a&gt; began with the decision to join the &lt;a href=\"European%20Economic%20Area\"&gt;European Economic Area&lt;/a&gt; (EEA). However, it did not enter into force until 1 January 1994, by which time the negotiations on actual membership were already well advanced.\nThe first in favour of EC membership were the Finnish economic interest groups in the early 1990s. Politicians had long held reservations in public, avoiding annoying the Soviet Union in midst of its transformation. Even in the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation's election debate in March 1991, only &lt;a href=\"Ole%20Norrback\"&gt;Ole Norrback&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20People%27s%20Party%20of%20Finland\"&gt;RKP&lt;/a&gt; was openly in favor of membership and the application for EC membership was not recorded directly in &lt;a href=\"Aho%20Cabinet\"&gt;Esko Aho's&lt;/a&gt; (Centre Party) government programme. President Mauno Koivisto was cautious and said later in the spring of 1991,\"I haven't bothered to resist it recently.\". During the spring and summer of 1991, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Coalition%20Party\"&gt;National Coalition&lt;/a&gt; and the opposition party SDP turned their positions EC-friendly, and after Prime Minister Aho came behind membership in the autumn, the government in January 1992 issued a report to Parliament, which decided to propose a candidate for membership.\nFollowing a positive vote in Parliament, Finland's application for EC membership was submitted on 18 March 1992. The accession negotiations began on 1 February 1993 simultaneously with Sweden and Austria. One of the most painful issues in the accession negotiations was the taking into account of Finland's northern climate in the agricultural aid policy. As a concession, Finland was eventually authorized to support agriculture with its own resources, in addition to EC subsidies. The accession negotiations were concluded at the same time as &lt;a href=\"Martti%20Ahtisaari\"&gt;Martti Ahtisaari&lt;/a&gt; became Finland's 10th president, and the first to be elected by direct a &lt;a href=\"Two-round%20system\"&gt;two-round&lt;/a&gt; popular vote.\nThe importance of EC membership was justified to the public particularly for economic reasons and with access to decision-making, but the security policy aspect was also at least equally important for many. On 16 October 1994, Esko Aho's previous promise was held with a referendum. It was Finland's second-ever consultative referendum, the earlier being for the repeal of the Prohibition Act at the end of 1931. In the EU referendum, 57% voted in favour of membership. A separate referendum was held in &lt;a href=\"%C3%85land\"&gt;\u00c5land&lt;/a&gt;, which was also in favor of membership.\nOn 1 January 1995, Finland joined the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, as the EC was now called with the entry into force of the &lt;a href=\"Maastricht%20Treaty\"&gt;Maastricht Treaty&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999, the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20markka\"&gt;Finnish markka&lt;/a&gt; was permanently fixed to the euro with FIM 5.94573 at EUR 1. In 2002, the euro became a cash currency and the markka, which had been in use for more than 140 years, was abolished after a two-month transitional period on 1 May, 2002.\nIn 2000, Finland's first female president, &lt;a href=\"Tarja%20Halonen\"&gt;Tarja Halonen&lt;/a&gt;, took office. The former President of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, received the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Peace%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; in 2008. The current president, &lt;a href=\"Sauli%20Niinist%C3%B6\"&gt;Sauli Niinist\u00f6&lt;/a&gt;, took office in 2012."
