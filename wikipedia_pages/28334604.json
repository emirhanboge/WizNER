    "text": "Kipling Taquana Anderson (January 24, 1938 \u2013 August 29, 2007), known professionally as Kip Anderson, was an American &lt;a href=\"soul%20blues\"&gt;soul blues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhythm%20and%20blues\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"singing\"&gt;singer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"songwriter\"&gt;songwriter&lt;/a&gt;. He is best known for his 1967 &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt;, \"A Knife and a Fork\". He recorded for many &lt;a href=\"record%20label\"&gt;record label&lt;/a&gt;s, worked as a &lt;a href=\"radio%20station\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Disc%20jockey\"&gt;DJ&lt;/a&gt;, and maintained a career lasting from the late 1950s to the 1990s, despite serving a decade-long custodial sentence. At various times Anderson worked with &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Cooke\"&gt;Sam Cooke&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Drifters\"&gt;Drifters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Butler%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Jerry Butler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Wilson\"&gt;Jackie Wilson&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nHe was born Kipling Taquana Anderson in &lt;a href=\"Starr%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Starr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anderson%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Anderson County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina\"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnderson had his first musical exposure in church, where he sang and played the &lt;a href=\"piano\"&gt;piano&lt;/a&gt;. After featuring in his high school band, Anderson met his future business partner, Charles Derrick, at radio station &lt;a href=\"WISW\"&gt;WOIC&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1959, Anderson's debut single, \"I Wanna Be the Only One\", was released by &lt;a href=\"Vee-Jay%20Records\"&gt;Vee-Jay Records&lt;/a&gt;. For his follow-up release, \"Oh My Linda\", he was accompanied by the guitarist &lt;a href=\"Mickey%20Baker\"&gt;Mickey Baker&lt;/a&gt;. Lack of commercial gains from recording led Anderson to find work as a disc jockey.\nEverlast Records released Anderson's third single, \"I Will Cry\" (1962), and \"Here I Am, Try Me\", and \"That's When the Crying Begins\" (1964) followed; the latter reached number 79 on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;. His stock rose further with \"I'll Get Along\", \"Woman How Do You Make Me Love You Like I Do\", and \"Without a Woman\" (1966).\nIn 1967, Anderson released \"A Knife and a Fork\" for &lt;a href=\"Checker%20Records\"&gt;Checker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction\"&gt;recorded&lt;/a&gt; at FAME Studios in &lt;a href=\"Alabama\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. \"A Knife and a Fork\" was a midtempo warning to his girlfriend about her consumption of food: \"girl, you gonna let a knife and a fork dig your grave\". The single entered the \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"record%20chart\"&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt;. A follow-up release, \"You'll Lose a Good Thing\", issued by &lt;a href=\"Excello%20Records\"&gt;Excello Records&lt;/a&gt;, also made the &lt;a href=\"Top%2040\"&gt;Top 40&lt;/a&gt; on the R&amp;B chart. \"I Went Off and Cried\" (1968) may be his best-remembered recording, next to \"A Knife and a Fork\". A &lt;a href=\"cover%20version\"&gt;cover version&lt;/a&gt; of \"A Knife and a Fork\" was recorded by &lt;a href=\"Rockpile\"&gt;Rockpile&lt;/a&gt; for the 1980 album \"&lt;a href=\"Seconds%20of%20Pleasure\"&gt;Seconds of Pleasure&lt;/a&gt;\".\nA dependency on heroin started to affect his work by 1970, and Excello cancelled his &lt;a href=\"recording%20contract\"&gt;recording contract&lt;/a&gt;. he continued to record and perform in the 1970s, but a ten-year prison sentence in 1974 for possession of heroin halted his activities. He later stated, \"It probably saved my life.\" While in prison he formed a gospel group with other inmates, who performed under surveillance at local churches and community events.\nUpon his release from prison, Anderson recorded a &lt;a href=\"gospel%20music\"&gt;gospel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"album\"&gt;album&lt;/a&gt;, before issuing more soul-based music for &lt;a href=\"Ichiban%20Records\"&gt;Ichiban Records&lt;/a&gt;. He also revived his career as a DJ when he moved back to Anderson County. He also hosted a gospel show on &lt;a href=\"WHQA\"&gt;WRIX-FM&lt;/a&gt; and served as vice president of Electric City Record's gospel division. In 1996, Anderson duetted with &lt;a href=\"Nappy%20Brown\"&gt;Nappy Brown&lt;/a&gt; on the \"Best of Both Worlds\" joint album.\nAnderson died in &lt;a href=\"Anderson%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Anderson, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, in August 2007, at the age of 69."
