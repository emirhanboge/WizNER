    "text": "Huh Jung-moo (&lt;a href=\"Korean%20language\"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt;: \ud5c8\uc815\ubb34, &lt;a href=\"Hanja\"&gt;Hanja&lt;/a&gt;: \u8a31\u4e01\u8302; born 13 January 1955) is a former &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and manager.\nPlaying career.\nHuh was one of the best South Korean college footballers before starting his semi-professional career. He was often compared with &lt;a href=\"Korea%20University\"&gt;Korea University&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cha%20Bum-kun\"&gt;Cha Bum-kun&lt;/a&gt; while playing for &lt;a href=\"Yonsei%20University\"&gt;Yonsei University&lt;/a&gt;. After his graduation, he joined &lt;a href=\"Gyeongju%20Korea%20Hydro%20%26amp%3B%20Nuclear%20Power%20FC\"&gt;Korea Electric Power FC&lt;/a&gt;, and simultaneously enlisted in &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Korea%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt; and Navy FC to do mandatory military service.\nWhen Huh was discharged from the military service, European clubs were interested in Asian players due to Cha Bum-kun's performance in the &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt;. Motivated by Cha, Huh also wanted to play for a European club, joining &lt;a href=\"Eredivisie\"&gt;Eredivisie&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"PSV%20Eindhoven\"&gt;PSV Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt; in August 1980. He mainly played as a defensive midfielder and showed impressive form for three years. &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Cruyff\"&gt;Johan Cruyff&lt;/a&gt;, who was tired from Huh's active marking, broke Huh's nose with his arm, and &lt;a href=\"Willem%20van%20Hanegem\"&gt;Willem van Hanegem&lt;/a&gt; showed a hysteria to Huh with the racist gesture \"Slant-eye\".\nHuh went back to South Korea after the &lt;a href=\"1982%E2%80%9383%20Eredivisie\"&gt;1982\u201383 season&lt;/a&gt;. His wife felt homesick, and he also didn't feel the need to continue his life abroad after hearing the news that a &lt;a href=\"K%20League\"&gt;professional league&lt;/a&gt; was founded in his country. Huh joined &lt;a href=\"Ulsan%20Hyundai%20FC\"&gt;Hyundai Horang-i&lt;/a&gt; as a founding member in 1984, and played for it for three years.\nHuh was on the &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;South Korea national team&lt;/a&gt; from 1974 to 1986, and won two gold medals in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;Asian Games&lt;/a&gt;. He was also a member of Korean squad in the &lt;a href=\"1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1986 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In a group match against &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, he left a famous photo that he appeared to be kicking &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Maradona\"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt; whose face twisted with pain. Afterwards, he scored a goal against &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nStyle of play.\nHuh was a versatile player, and could play in multiple positions. He was capable of playing as a &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Striker\"&gt;striker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Midfielder%23Winger\"&gt;winger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Midfielder%23Attacking%20midfielder\"&gt;attacking midfielder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Midfielder%23Defensive%20midfielder\"&gt;defensive midfielder&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Full-back\"&gt;full-back&lt;/a&gt;. He covered great distance by utilising his competitive spirit and stamina. Because of his tough and energetic playing style, he was nicknamed \"&lt;a href=\"Korean%20Jindo%20Dog\"&gt;Jindogae&lt;/a&gt;\", the hunter dog breed originated from his hometown &lt;a href=\"Jindo%20Island\"&gt;Jindo Island&lt;/a&gt;. He was also adept at &lt;a href=\"Marking%20%28association%20football%29%23Man-to-man%20marking\"&gt;man marking&lt;/a&gt; and often duelled with &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Cruyff\"&gt;Johan Cruyff&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax%E2%80%93PSV%20Eindhoven%20rivalry\"&gt;De Topper&lt;/a&gt;. He didn't have rapid pace, but he could dribble the ball with intelligent movement.\nManagerial career.\nHuh has previously coached the &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;South Korea national football team&lt;/a&gt; twice before, as well as running the &lt;a href=\"Pohang%20Steelers\"&gt;POSCO Atoms&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jeonnam%20Dragons\"&gt;Jeonnam Dragons&lt;/a&gt;. His team won the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;Korean FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; three times.\nHis first term as the coach of the national team was temporary. In 1998, he was appointed for the second time. Then he picked up some nameless young players and give them important positions instead of established stars, inviting harsh criticism against him. After failures in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2000 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1998%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;1998 Asian Games&lt;/a&gt;, he was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Guus%20Hiddink\"&gt;Guus Hiddink&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince Hiddink's incredible success in the &lt;a href=\"2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2002 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korea%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Korea Football Association&lt;/a&gt; began hiring foreign managers, including &lt;a href=\"Humberto%20Coelho\"&gt;Humberto Coelho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jo%20Bonfrere\"&gt;Jo Bonfrere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Advocaat\"&gt;Dick Advocaat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pim%20Verbeek\"&gt;Pim Verbeek&lt;/a&gt;. They failed to match Hiddink's success, however. Meanwhile, the criticized \"nameless players\" picked by Huh became stars. &lt;a href=\"Park%20Ji-sung\"&gt;Park Ji-sung&lt;/a&gt;, once the most unpopular player while Huh was coach, turned into the most successful player in Asia. &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Young-pyo\"&gt;Lee Young-pyo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seol%20Ki-hyeon\"&gt;Seol Ki-hyeon&lt;/a&gt; also rose in prominence. The success of Huh's former apprentices and that of himself in Jeonnam Dragons made him revalued as a candidate for head coach. Huh was re-appointed in December 2007 after leading candidates &lt;a href=\"Mick%20McCarthy\"&gt;Mick McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A9rard%20Houllier\"&gt;G\u00e9rard Houllier&lt;/a&gt; both rejected the job.\nHuh got the team qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; without a loss in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28AFC%29\"&gt;qualification&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 2009, Huh won the AFC Coach of the Year Award after leading the national team to 27 consecutive games without a loss. Huh's national team successed to advance to the round of 16 in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nCareer statistics.\nClub.\nSource:\nInternational.\nSource:\nHonours.\nPlayer.\nYonsei University\nROK Navy\nHyundai Horang-i\nSouth Korea\nIndividual\nManager.\nPOSCO Atoms\nJeonnam Dragons\nSouth Korea\nIndividual"
