    "text": "Condition of Farm Labour in Eastern Germany (in German: Die Verh\u00e4ltnisse der Landarbeiter im ostelbischen Deutschland) is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=\"Maximilian%20Weber\"&gt;Maximilian Weber&lt;/a&gt;, a German &lt;a href=\"economist\"&gt;economist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sociologist\"&gt;sociologist&lt;/a&gt;, in 1892. Note that the original edition was in German and the title can be translated as \"Condition of Farm Labour in Eastern Germany\".\nIn 1890 an &lt;a href=\"Voluntary%20association\"&gt;association&lt;/a&gt; (known as &lt;a href=\"Verein%20f%C3%BCr%20Socialpolitik\"&gt;Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik&lt;/a&gt;) of scholars, government officials and other specialists decided to study the situation of &lt;a href=\"landowner\"&gt;landowner&lt;/a&gt;s in Germany. Weber assumed responsibility for reviewing data from German provinces east of the &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt; River.\nThe situation in that part of Germany was influenced by the influx of &lt;a href=\"migratory%20worker\"&gt;migratory worker&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, with special regards to &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poles&lt;/a&gt; and Russians, while the German labourers wanted to increase their upward &lt;a href=\"social%20mobility\"&gt;social mobility&lt;/a&gt;, especially by changing the traditional &lt;a href=\"labour%20relation\"&gt;labour relation&lt;/a&gt;s of that region (workers could only become labourers on annual &lt;a href=\"contract\"&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt;).\nHowever, their demands and expectations were actually putting them in a weaker position regarding the economic struggle for survival, as they were less &lt;a href=\"competitive\"&gt;competitive&lt;/a&gt; than migratory workers.\nWeber analyzed those changing labour relations as a symptom of widespread changes in the entire German society."
