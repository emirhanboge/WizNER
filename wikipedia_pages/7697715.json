    "text": "An anti-submarine missile is a &lt;a href=\"standoff%20missile\"&gt;standoff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"anti-submarine%20weapon\"&gt;anti-submarine weapon&lt;/a&gt;. Often a variant of &lt;a href=\"anti-ship%20missile\"&gt;anti-ship missile&lt;/a&gt; designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a &lt;a href=\"jet%20engine\"&gt;jet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"rocket%20engine\"&gt;rocket&lt;/a&gt; engine, to deliver: an &lt;a href=\"explosive%20material\"&gt;explosive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warhead\"&gt;warhead&lt;/a&gt; aimed directly at a &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href=\"depth%20charge\"&gt;depth charge&lt;/a&gt;, or; a homing &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; that is carried from a launch ship, or other platform, to the vicinity of a target.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Depth%20charge\"&gt;Depth charge&lt;/a&gt;s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt; was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range.\nVarious &lt;a href=\"mortar%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt;-type projectors, including &lt;a href=\"hedgehog%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;Hedgehog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"squid%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;Squid&lt;/a&gt;, were devised during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"missile\"&gt;missile&lt;/a&gt;s were developed to provide greater range with reduced &lt;a href=\"recoil\"&gt;recoil&lt;/a&gt;. Some missiles and rockets, such as &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Sang%20Eo\"&gt;Hong Sang Eo&lt;/a&gt; carry &lt;a href=\"homing%20torpedo\"&gt;homing torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.\nThe advantage of an anti-submarine missile is the attack stand-off range. The Swedish Bofors 375mm m/50 &lt;a href=\"Anti-Submarine%20Warfare\"&gt;Anti-Submarine Warfare&lt;/a&gt; (ASW) rockets, in the past commonly used by Sweden, France, Japan and Germany for instance, can travel as far as 3600m depending on the rocket used. The USSR developed its own anti-submarine rockets in the &lt;a href=\"RBU-6000\"&gt;RBU series&lt;/a&gt; and these are still in use in Russia and in countries using Russian designed ships. Today anti-submarine rockets have been phased out in most western navies, replaced by the Homing ASW Torpedo."
