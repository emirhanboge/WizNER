For this to happen, it will be a responsibility of the organizing committee to choose which of twenty-nine sports included within the status of indoor sports or martial arts sports and not part in latest editions of the Asian Games. The organizing committee can choose any sports part in latest editions of the Asian Games or not within the status of indoor sports or martial arts sports, if there are demands from the host country.\nFollowing the signing contract after successful negotiations with Thailand, the Olympic Council of Asia initially announced that the Games would feature twenty-six disciplines in twenty-four sports, including the seventeen indoor sports and seven martial sports and two demonstration sports established in the Games charter. On 21 May 2020, the Olympic Council of Asia and the organizing committee announced the final number of sports on this edition's program with finals being held in twenty eight sports, seven more than those played in the previous edition in 2017. The number of sports programme increased to twenty-nine sports after successful negotiations to add shooting.\nDue to a ban imposed by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Weightlifting%20Federation\"&gt;International Weightlifting Federation&lt;/a&gt; on Thailand, weightlifting events have to be excluded.\nA total of thirty-one disciplines in twenty-nine sports and two demonstration sports are scheduled to include.\nSports program.\nCheerleading, Floorball, Indoor rowing and Netball are sports that have recently been approved by &lt;a href=\"International%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; and are on the &lt;a href=\"World%20Games\"&gt;World Games&lt;/a&gt; program and have low popularity and visibity in certain regions of Asia.However, in another countries or regions of the continent they are extremely popular.Going according to the original proposal of the event, this is their chance to be part of the sports program of a multisport event, which certainly increases their visibility on the continent and increase the chances that they will be included in the Olympic Games program in the future.\nOlympic Sports played in other formats.\nTwelve sports that are part of the current Olympic program (&lt;a href=\"sport%20of%20athletics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"badminton\"&gt;badminton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3x3%20basketball\"&gt;3x3 basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"field%20hockey\"&gt;hockey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"karate\"&gt;karate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"roller%20sports\"&gt;roller sports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rowing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;rowing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shooting%20sports\"&gt;shooting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"swimming%20%28sport%29\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"taekwondo\"&gt;taekwondo&lt;/a&gt;) are in this edition's program, however, some of them will be played in formats that are not part of the Olympic Games. Among these, three are new sports (badminton, shooting, and volleyball). Although they are part of the Asian Games programme too, the organizing committee will revamp the events to differ from current &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Games\"&gt;Asian Games&lt;/a&gt; programme. Badminton events will be reduced from 7 to 3. The number of events in the shooting will also drop from 20 to just 5,only the pistol events (10 and 25 meters) are scheduled to be held. Changes will also happen in volleyball tournaments. Each participating team will be able to register 12 athletes, however, up to 3 athletes may be over 23 years old.\nThis measure was taken due to the congestion of the sport calendar in 2021, as the event coincides with the &lt;a href=\"FIVB\"&gt;FIVB&lt;/a&gt; Volleyball Nations League first three weeks.\nAnother specific case is that of &lt;a href=\"sepak%20takraw\"&gt;sepak takraw&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"2009%20Asian%20Indoor%20Games\"&gt;12 years hiatus&lt;/a&gt; the sport will be back on the program.As the national sport of Thailand, the format of the competitions and the number of events at the &lt;a href=\"Sepak%20takraw%20at%20the%202018%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;last Asian Games will be maintained&lt;/a&gt;. In addition,the four events that were excluded from Jakarta will be back, along the hoop, it is expected that five new mixed events will be added to the program.\nParticipating National Olympic Committees.\nOn July 16, 2020, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Olympic%20Committee%20of%20Thailand\"&gt;National Olympic Committee of Thailand&lt;/a&gt; announced that it proposed to the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Council%20of%20Asia\"&gt;Olympic Council of Asia&lt;/a&gt; (OCA) to open the event for athletes from the 24 National Olympic Committees from the &lt;a href=\"Oceania%20National%20Olympic%20Committees\"&gt;Oceania National Olympic Committees&lt;/a&gt; (ONOC). The proposal was accepted without any reservations by the OCA and the ONOC,as they proved the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Asian%20Indoor%20and%20Martial%20Arts%20Games\"&gt;success on the 2017 Games held in Ashgabat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2017%20Asian%20Winter%20Games\"&gt;2017 Sapporo Winter Games&lt;/a&gt;. The three stakeholders are planning to authorize the registration of athletes in 16 individual sports as integral part of the games.\n\"The numbers in parenthesis represents the number of participants entered.\"\nMarketing.\nEmblem.\nThe emblem of the 2021 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games is inspired by the flower garland called &lt;a href=\"Phuang%20malai\"&gt;Phuang malai&lt;/a&gt;, symbolizing the interconnectedness of all participants from all parts of Asia.
