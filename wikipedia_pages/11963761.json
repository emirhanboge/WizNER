    "text": "Hellwege is a municipality in the &lt;a href=\"Rotenburg%20%28district%29\"&gt;district of Rotenburg&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Saxony\"&gt;Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nHellwege belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Bishopric%20of%20Verden\"&gt;Prince-Bishopric of Verden&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1180. In 1648 the Prince-Bishopric was transformed into the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Verden\"&gt;Principality of Verden&lt;/a&gt;, which was first ruled in &lt;a href=\"personal%20union\"&gt;personal union&lt;/a&gt; by the Swedish Crown - interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712-1715) - and from 1715 on by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hanover\"&gt;Hanoverian&lt;/a&gt; Crown. In 1807 the ephemeral&lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Westphalia\"&gt;Kingdom of Westphalia&lt;/a&gt; annexed the Principality, before &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the Principality was restored to the &lt;a href=\"Electorate%20of%20Hanover\"&gt;Electorate of Hanover&lt;/a&gt;, which - after its upgrade to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hanover\"&gt;Kingdom of Hanover&lt;/a&gt; in 1814 - incorporated the Principality in a &lt;a href=\"real%20union\"&gt;real union&lt;/a&gt; and the Princely territory, including Hellwege, became part of the new &lt;a href=\"Stade%20%28region%29\"&gt;Stade Region&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1823. The name hellwege can also be used as a last name, and it is popular in Germany."
