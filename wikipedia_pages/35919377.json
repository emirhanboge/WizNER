    "text": "Geet (song or lyrical poetry) (&lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt;:\u0917\u0940\u0924) (&lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt;:\u06af\u06cc\u062a) in &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt; may refer to any &lt;a href=\"poem\"&gt;poem&lt;/a&gt; set to &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; that can be sung alone or as a &lt;a href=\"duet\"&gt;duet&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=\"Choir\"&gt;chorus&lt;/a&gt;. It has remained popular in all parts of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20sub-continent\"&gt;Indian sub-continent&lt;/a&gt; particularly in the &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt; speaking areas. \nIn its classical form a Geet conforms to Prabandha, a composition bound by Dhatu that comprises &lt;a href=\"Sthayi\"&gt;Sthayi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antara%20%28music%29\"&gt;Antara&lt;/a&gt;, Dhrupad etc.; and Anga that comprises etc. Therefore, it has a beginning part known as Prabandha which is followed by an Udgraah or Dhruv which is its part that is repeatedly sung and cannot be left out, the ending part is known as &lt;a href=\"Aabhog\"&gt;Aabhog&lt;/a&gt; and that part of the geet which is between Dhruv and &lt;a href=\"Aabhog\"&gt;Aabhog&lt;/a&gt; is called Pada or Antara. &lt;a href=\"Dhrupad\"&gt;Dhrupad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khyal\"&gt;Khyal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thumri\"&gt;Thumri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ghazals\"&gt;Ghazals&lt;/a&gt; are the accepted forms of &lt;a href=\"Hindustani%20classical%20music\"&gt;Hindustani classical music&lt;/a&gt;. The legendary singers Mian &lt;a href=\"Tansen\"&gt;Tansen&lt;/a&gt; and Raja &lt;a href=\"Man%20Singh%20Tomar\"&gt;Man Singh Tomar&lt;/a&gt; were Dhrupad singers.\nGeets are a significant part of Indian folk-literature meant for all memorable occasions, then they are known as \"lok-geets\" sung by different communities and sections of society. These \"lok-geets\" include &lt;a href=\"Chaiti\"&gt;Chaiti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kajari\"&gt;Kajari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hori%20%28music%29\"&gt;Hori&lt;/a&gt; and Sawani. However, the boundary-line separating folk songs from classical songs cannot be easily traced and re-drawn.\nGeets are also central to many cultures and communities across the globe and are used in a variety of contexts and purposes. Frequently, religious communities employ geets to not only express devotion but also to transmit knowledge of their faiths. For instance, in the Satpanthi Ismaili communities of South Asia (also known as &lt;a href=\"Khoja\"&gt;Khojas&lt;/a&gt;), geets of devotion are composed and sung by community artistes. The Geets Portall at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Saskatchewan\"&gt;University of Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt; Library is a digital curation of the Ismaili community's devotional tradition of geets.\nContext.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Urdu%20poetry\"&gt;Urdu poetry&lt;/a&gt; its roots are found in &lt;a href=\"Dakhani\"&gt;Dakhani&lt;/a&gt; Shairi whose most important feature is its Indian ethos with the strain being feminine, and the tone, delicate and elegant; Urdu Geets mainly speak about feminine anguish. &lt;a href=\"Dakhini\"&gt;Dakhini&lt;/a&gt; or Hindavi forms part of what is known as proto-Hindi Literature whose origin can be traced to a far earlier period that produced the great historical lyric &lt;a href=\"Prithviraj%20Raso\"&gt;Prithviraj Raso&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=\"Chand%20Bardai\"&gt;Chand Bardai&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Hindi%20literature\"&gt;Hindi poetry&lt;/a&gt; that has its roots in the &lt;a href=\"Avadhi\"&gt;Avadhi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brij%20Bhasha\"&gt;Brij Bhasha&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Bhakti\"&gt;Bhakti&lt;/a&gt; movement amalgamating the more ancient forms of Sanskrit and Persian poetry brought to the fore the wide range of &lt;a href=\"rasa%20%28theology%29\"&gt;rasa&lt;/a&gt;s from love to heroism that later on in the Ritikal introduced erotism in a big way. Urdu geets are basically found written in the &lt;a href=\"Hindustani%20language\"&gt;Hindustani&lt;/a&gt; language that took shape after the colonization of India by the British and had subsequently become the court language in &lt;a href=\"Delhi\"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avadh\"&gt;Avadh&lt;/a&gt; whereas Hindi geets have retained the flavour drawn from earlier compositions in Rajasthani dialect, &lt;a href=\"Brij%20Bhasha\"&gt;Brij Bhasha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maithali\"&gt;Maithali&lt;/a&gt;."
