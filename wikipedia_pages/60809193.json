    "text": "Giovanni Gualberto Bottarelli wrote the &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; for several &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;s to which &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Christian%20Bach\"&gt;Johann Christian Bach&lt;/a&gt; wrote the music, and adapted many other operas. The first collaboration with Bach was \"Orione\", performed at the &lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre\"&gt;King's Theatre&lt;/a&gt; (now Her Majesty's Theatre) in &lt;a href=\"Haymarket%2C%20London\"&gt;Haymarket&lt;/a&gt; to great acclaim in February 1763. \"&lt;a href=\"Zanaida\"&gt;Zanaida&lt;/a&gt;\", a three-act opera debuted in London in May 1763, but was less well received. Other works were \"\"Addio di Londra\", \"Carattaco\", \"Cesare e Cleopatra\", \"Il Cid\" \", \"\"L'Endimione\", and \"Rodelinda regina de' Longobardi\"\".\n\"Il r\u00e9 pastore\" (The royal shepherd), adapted by Bottarelli, was printed in London in 1765.\nBottarelli was a witness in a court case against &lt;a href=\"Giacomo%20Casanova\"&gt;Casanova&lt;/a&gt;, who reported of him \"Botarelli publishes in a pamphlet all the ceremonies of the Freemasons, and the only sentence passed on him is: 'He is a scoundrel. We knew that before!'\" Casanova also calls Bottarelli a rascal, after meeting him and his family in penury, and reports that Bottarelli had been a monk in his native city, Pisa, and had fled to England with his wife, who had been a nun."
