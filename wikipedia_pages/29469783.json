    "text": "The Oatlands Railway was a short &lt;a href=\"Spur%20line\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Line%2C%20Tasmania\"&gt;Main Line&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Launceston%2C%20Tasmania\"&gt;Launceston&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hobart\"&gt;Hobart&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tasmania\"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, which was built to give rail access to the town of &lt;a href=\"Oatlands%2C%20Tasmania\"&gt;Oatlands&lt;/a&gt;. The railway opened on 13 May 1885 and it closed on 10 June 1949.\nThe line branched off of the Main Line in &lt;a href=\"Parattah%2C%20Tasmania\"&gt;Parattah&lt;/a&gt; outside the Tudor style Parattah Hotel and followed parallel to the Main Line for approximately before branching off in a north west direction towards &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Dulverton\"&gt;Lake Dulverton&lt;/a&gt;. From there, the railway followed the lake's shoreline before turning in on Wellington Street and ending where it intersects with High Street. The original station building is now used as a child care centre. Much of the former route is now used as a bike trail, a section of it is clearly visible as a terrace like formation at Mahers Point and part of an embankment and small bridge runs alongside the road to Parattah, where it crosses Parattah Creek. The locomotive \"&lt;a href=\"Big%20Ben%20%28locomotive%29\"&gt;Big Ben&lt;/a&gt;\" used to operate the line from 1948 until the line closed a year later in 1949."
