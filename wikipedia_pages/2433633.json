    "text": "Acer circinatum, the vine maple, is a species of &lt;a href=\"maple\"&gt;maple&lt;/a&gt; native to western &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, from southwest &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; to northern &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, usually within of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; coast, found along the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Gorge\"&gt;Columbia Gorge&lt;/a&gt; and Coastal Forest. It belongs to the \"Palmatum\" group of maple trees native to &lt;a href=\"East%20Asia\"&gt;East Asia&lt;/a&gt; with its closest relatives being the \"&lt;a href=\"Acer%20japonicum\"&gt;Acer japonicum&lt;/a&gt;\" (Fullmoon Maple) and \"&lt;a href=\"Acer%20pseudosieboldianum\"&gt;Acer pseudosieboldianum&lt;/a&gt;\" (Korean Maple). It can be difficult to distinguish from these species in cultivation. It is the only member of the \"Palmatum\" group that resides outside of &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt most commonly grows as a large &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt; growing to around tall, but it will occasionally form a small to medium-sized &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;, exceptionally to tall. The shoots are slender and hairless. It typically grows in the under story below much taller &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; trees, but can sometimes be found in open ground, and occurs at altitudes from sea level up to .\nThe &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are opposite, and palmately lobed with 7 to 11 lobes, almost circular in outline, long and broad, and thinly hairy on the underside; the lobes are pointed and with coarsely toothed margins. The leaves turn bright yellow to orange-red in fall. The &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are small, in diameter, with a dark red calyx and five short greenish-yellow petals; they are produced in open corymbs of 4 to 20 together in spring. The &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; is a two-seeded &lt;a href=\"Samara%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;samara&lt;/a&gt;, each &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt; in diameter, with a lateral wing long.\nVine maple trees can bend over easily. Sometimes, this can cause the top of the tree to grow into the ground and send out a new root system, creating a natural arch. This characteristic makes it the only maple capable of &lt;a href=\"layering\"&gt;layering&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is occasionally cultivated outside its native range as an &lt;a href=\"ornamental%20tree\"&gt;ornamental tree&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Juneau%2C%20Alaska\"&gt;Juneau, Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ottawa\"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Huntsville%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Huntsville, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, and also in northwestern &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nUses.\nVarious birds and mammals eat the seeds of this species."
