The station served both the former &lt;a href=\"Stafford%20to%20Shrewsbury%20Line\"&gt;Stafford to Shrewsbury Line&lt;/a&gt; and was the start of the &lt;a href=\"Coalport%20Branch%20Line\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt; to Coalport. The station was opened in 1849 and closed in 1964.\nThe line through Hadley was closed from 1964, with the last remaining stretches of track being taken up in 1991.
