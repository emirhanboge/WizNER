The competition supplanted the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Super%20Rugby%20season\"&gt;2020 Super Rugby season&lt;/a&gt;, which was suspended in March due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnnounced on 6 May, the competition ran from 13 June to 14 August, making it the first professional rugby union competition to occur since the beginning of the pandemic. On 8 June, with most non-travel restrictions relating to the pandemic having been lifted in New Zealand (Alert Level 1), it was announced that the matches would be played with spectators admitted, making it among the first professional sporting events not played &lt;a href=\"Behind%20closed%20doors%20%28sport%29\"&gt;behind closed doors&lt;/a&gt; since the beginning of the pandemic's global spread.\nDue to the reinstatement of restrictions nationally on 11 August after new cases of community transmission, one match in the final round was played behind closed doors, and the other was cancelled due to Alert Level 3 in Auckland and declared a 0-0 draw \u2014 resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; clinching the tournament championship.\nWith New Zealand border restrictions and managed isolation requirements not easing despite the country back in level 1 alert level as of October 11, 2020, Super Rugby Aotearoa and Australia will return in 2021, and Super Rugby Aotearoa will by sponsored by &lt;a href=\"Sky%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;Sky New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.

It was also stated that referees would be stricter in applying laws for &lt;a href=\"Breakdown%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;breakdowns&lt;/a&gt; to increase the pace of play.\nMatches.\nRound 10.\nOn 14 August, due to restrictions being reintroduced nationwide after new cases of community transmission (with Alert Level 3 in effect in Auckland and thus prohibiting all events, and all other regions under Alert Level 2), the penultimate match between the Highlanders and Hurricanes was played behind closed doors, and the final match between the Blues and Crusaders was cancelled and declared a draw (with both teams awarded two points on the final standings).\nPlayers.\nSquads.\n "
