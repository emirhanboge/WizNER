    "title": "List of tallest dams in the United States",
    "text": "This is a list of the tallest dams in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The main list includes all U.S. dams over tall, and a second list gives the tallest dams in each &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;. Dimensions given are for foundation height, not hydraulic height or &lt;a href=\"hydraulic%20head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;. Structures such as levees, dikes and &lt;a href=\"tailings%20dam\"&gt;tailings dam&lt;/a&gt;s are not included in the lists. Decommissioned or failed dams, such as &lt;a href=\"Teton%20Dam\"&gt;Teton Dam&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Idaho\"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, are included. Both lists are works in progress and will be updated periodically with new information. There are currently 75 entries on the main list.\nMost of the U.S.'s taller dams are located in the west because of the steeper and more rugged topography. The tallest is &lt;a href=\"Oroville%20Dam\"&gt;Oroville Dam&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"embankment%20dam\"&gt;embankment dam&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1968. Five of the ten tallest dams in the U.S. are located in California. The &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20River\"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20River\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sacramento%20River\"&gt;Sacramento&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"San%20Joaquin%20River\"&gt;San Joaquin&lt;/a&gt; river systems contain the greatest number of tall dams. In the eastern U.S., tall dams are less common because of the lesser vertical relief. The tallest dam is in china &lt;a href=\"Fontana%20Dam\"&gt;Fontana Dam&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, which ranks 20th in height among all U.S. dams."
