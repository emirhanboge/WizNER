    "text": "The Tumwater Falls are a series of cascades on the &lt;a href=\"Deschutes%20River%20%28Washington%29\"&gt;Deschutes River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tumwater%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Tumwater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, United States. They are located near where the river empties into &lt;a href=\"Budd%20Inlet\"&gt;Budd Inlet&lt;/a&gt;, a southerly arm of &lt;a href=\"Puget%20Sound\"&gt;Puget Sound&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Olympia%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Olympia&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeology.\nThe Deschutes River carved a course through glacial debris left after the &lt;a href=\"Pleistocene%20ice%20age\"&gt;Pleistocene ice age&lt;/a&gt; until it reached volcanic bedrock, forming the falls as it coursed down to Puget Sound.\nHistory.\nTumwater Falls was the site of &lt;a href=\"New%20Market%2C%20Washington\"&gt;New Market&lt;/a&gt;, the first European settlement in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Washington\"&gt;Western Washington&lt;/a&gt;. It was also the site of the now-defunct &lt;a href=\"Olympia%20Brewing%20Company\"&gt;Olympia Brewing Company&lt;/a&gt;.\nOlympia Light and Power Company constructed a dam and a &lt;a href=\"hydroelectric%20power%20plant\"&gt;hydroelectric power plant&lt;/a&gt; at the falls in 1890, a decade before the &lt;a href=\"Snoqualmie%20Falls\"&gt;Snoqualmie Falls&lt;/a&gt; powerplant outside &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;. The plant powered an Olympia\u2013Tumwater streetcar, among other things. A dam at above sea level created a &lt;a href=\"Hydraulic%20head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; for the powerhouse and still stands on the Deschutes River.\nThe Tumwater Falls created an impassable barrier to salmon until 1952, when a &lt;a href=\"fish%20ladder\"&gt;fish ladder&lt;/a&gt; was built by the Washington Department of Fisheries (now the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20Department%20of%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife\"&gt;Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;), to provide salmon access to the newly constructed fish hatchery located immediately above the falls. Prior to the 1952 hatchery operations, the Deschutes river above the Tumwater Falls was a river system free of the influence of migrating and spawning salmon, an unusual ecological occurrence in the riparian systems of Puget Sound.\nIn 1962, Olympia Brewing Company donated of land surrounding the falls to the Olympia-Tumwater Foundation, and Tumwater Falls Park was created. The park receives 200,000 visitors annually."
