    "text": "A cashless society describes an economic state whereby &lt;a href=\"financial%20transaction\"&gt;financial transaction&lt;/a&gt;s are not conducted with money in the form of physical &lt;a href=\"banknote\"&gt;banknote&lt;/a&gt;s or coins, but rather through the transfer of digital information (usually an electronic representation of money) between the transacting parties. Cashless societies have existed from the time when human society came into existence, based on &lt;a href=\"barter\"&gt;barter&lt;/a&gt; and other methods of exchange, and cashless transactions have also become possible in modern times using &lt;a href=\"Credit%20card\"&gt;credit cards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Debit%20card\"&gt;debit cards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20payment\"&gt;mobile payments&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Digital%20currency\"&gt;digital currencies&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"bitcoin\"&gt;bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. However this article discusses and focuses on the term \"cashless society\" in the sense of a move towards, and implications of, a society where cash is replaced by its &lt;a href=\"digital%20currency\"&gt;digital equivalent&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in other words, &lt;a href=\"legal%20tender\"&gt;legal tender&lt;/a&gt; (money) exists, is recorded, and is exchanged only in electronic digital form.\nSuch a concept has been discussed widely, particularly because the world is experiencing a rapid and increasing use of digital methods of recording, managing, and exchanging money in &lt;a href=\"commerce\"&gt;commerce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"investment%20banking\"&gt;investment&lt;/a&gt; and daily life in many parts of the world, and transactions which would historically have been undertaken with cash are often now undertaken electronically. Some countries now set limits on transactions and transaction values for which non-electronic payment may be legally used.\nHistory.\nThe trend towards the use of non-cash transactions and settlement in daily life began during the 1990s when electronic banking became common. By the 2010s digital payment methods were widespread in many countries, with examples including intermediaries such as &lt;a href=\"PayPal\"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"digital%20wallet\"&gt;digital wallet&lt;/a&gt; systems such as &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Pay\"&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt;, contactless and &lt;a href=\"Near-field%20communication\"&gt;NFC&lt;/a&gt; payments by electronic card or &lt;a href=\"smartphone\"&gt;smartphone&lt;/a&gt;, and electronic bills and banking, all in widespread use. At this point cash had become actively disfavored in some kinds of transaction which would historically have been very ordinary to pay with physical tender, and larger cash amounts were in some situations treated with suspicion, due to its versatility and ease of use in &lt;a href=\"money%20laundering\"&gt;money laundering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"financing%20of%20terrorism\"&gt;financing of terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, payment with a large amount of cash has been actively prohibited by some suppliers and retailers, to the point of coining the expression of a \"war on cash\".\nThe 2016 United States User Consumer Survey Study claims that 75% of respondents preferred a credit or debit card as their payment method while only 11% of respondents preferred cash.\nSince the founding of both companies in 2009, digital payments can now be made by methods such as &lt;a href=\"Venmo\"&gt;Venmo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Square%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt;. Venmo allows individuals to make direct payments to other individuals without having cash accessible. Square is an innovation that allows primarily small businesses to receive payments from their clients.\nBy 2016, only about 2% of the value transacted in Sweden was by cash, and only about 20% of retail transactions were in cash. Fewer than half of bank branches in the country conducted cash transactions. The move away from cash is attributed to banks convincing employers to use direct deposit in the 1960s, banks charging for checks starting in the 1990s, banks launching the convenient &lt;a href=\"Swish%20%28payment%29\"&gt;Swish&lt;/a&gt; smartphone-to-phone payment system in 2012, and the launch of &lt;a href=\"iZettle\"&gt;iZettle&lt;/a&gt; for small merchants to accept credit cards in 2011.\nResearch.\nAmong the first sociological studies about cashless societies, see Aldo Haesler, Sociologie de l'argent et postmodernit\u00e9, Geneva &amp; Paris 1995.\nMeasurement.\nShare of payments.\nA common measure of how close to a \"cashless society\" a country is becoming is some measure of the number of cashless payments or person to person transactions are done in that country. For instance, the Nordic countries conduct more cashless transactions than most Europeans. Levels of cash in circulation can widely differ among two countries with a similar measure of cashless transactions.\nAmount of cash in circulation.\nEven though a cashless society is widely discussed, most countries are increasing their currency supply. Exceptions are South Africa whose supply of banknotes fluctuates wildly compared to most nations, and Sweden which has significantly reduced its currency supply since 2007. China's currency has decreased from 2017 to 2018\nAmount of cash in circulation (historical).\nThe amount of cash in circulation was much lower in past decades in all countries except Sweden. The oldest comparative figures at &lt;a href=\"Bank%20for%20International%20Settlements\"&gt;Bank for International Settlements&lt;/a&gt; were from 1978 and only including the USD and 10 other currencies.\nLegal status.\nUnited States.\nUnder a &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; law dating back to 1978, no retailer may \"discriminate against a cash buyer by requiring the use of credit\". It was the only U.S. state to have such a law until March 2019, when &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; passed similar legislation; car rentals, &lt;a href=\"parking%20garage\"&gt;parking garage&lt;/a&gt;s, and airport stores have carve-outs under the legislation. The bill came shortly after the city of &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; passed a similar law. &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; has also banned cashless stores. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; became the third U.S. state to outlaw cashless businesses when its ban took effect on July 1, 2019. A requirement in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; that businesses accept cash took effect on November 19, 2020. A similar law was enacted in the &lt;a href=\"District%20of%20Columbia\"&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020.\nAdvantages of a cashless society.\nReduced business risks and costs.\nCashless payments eliminate several risks, including &lt;a href=\"counterfeit\"&gt;counterfeit&lt;/a&gt; money (though stolen cards are still a risk), theft of cash by employees, and burglary or robbery of cash. The costs of physical security, physically processing cash (withdrawing from the bank, transporting, counting) are also reduced once a business goes completely cashless, as is the risk that the business will not have enough cash on hand to make the change.\nReducing transmittal of disease via cash.\nCash provides a good home for disease-causing organisms (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus. Salmonella species, Escherichia coli, &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;...). However, cash has been found to be less likely to transmit disease than commonly touched items such as credit card terminals and pinpads. Such concerns prompted the German central bank, Deutsche Bundesbank, to state that \u201cCash poses no particular risk of infection for public\u201d.\nTransaction speed.\nRestaurant chain &lt;a href=\"Sweetgreen\"&gt;Sweetgreen&lt;/a&gt; found cashless locations (with customers using payment cards or the chain's mobile app) could process transactions 15% faster.\nElimination of high-denomination notes for purposes of reducing criminal activity.\nOne significant societal advantage cited by proponents is the difficulty of &lt;a href=\"money%20laundering\"&gt;money laundering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tax%20evasion\"&gt;tax evasion&lt;/a&gt;, performing illegal transactions, and funding illegal activity in a cashless society. Many countries have regulated, restricted, or banned private digital currencies such as &lt;a href=\"Legality%20of%20bitcoin%20by%20country%20or%20territory\"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, partly to prevent illegal transactions. Large amounts of value can also be stored in real estate, antiques, or commodities like diamonds, gold, silver, and platinum.\nSome have proposed a \"reduced cash\" system, where small bills and coins are available for anonymous, everyday transactions, but high-denomination notes are eliminated. This would make the amount of cash needed to move large amounts of value physically awkward and easier to detect. Large notes are also the most valuable to counterfeit. The United Kingdom declared only banknotes of \u00a35 or less were legal tender near the end of World War II on 16 April 1945 due to fear of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Bernhard\"&gt;Nazi counterfeiting&lt;/a&gt;, although a \u00a35 note then had the purchasing power of \u00a3217.22 in 2020, over four times larger than the current largest note of \u00a350. On 14 July 1969, the federal government of the United States declared that banknotes of over $100 in value would remain legal tender, but any notes in government hands would be destroyed and that no new notes of those denominations would be printed in the future, although such notes were last printed in 1945, 24 years earlier. Canada did the same thing with the CAD$1000 banknote beginning on 12 May 2000. Sweden printed 10,000kr banknotes in 1939 and 1958, but declared them invalid after 31 December 1991. Singapore announced on 2 July 2014, that they would no longer produce the SGD$10,000 banknote, and it was no longer issued as of 1 October 2014. The &lt;a href=\"European%20Central%20Bank\"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt; no longer issues the \u20ac500 denomination &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; banknotes as of 27 April 2019.\nBetter collection of economic data.\nRather than conducting \"costly and periodic\" surveys and sampling of real-world transactions, \"real data\" collected on citizens' spending can assist in devising and implementing policies that are deduced from actual data. With recorded financial transactions, the government can better track the movement of the money through financial records which enables them to track the black money and illegal transactions taking place in the country.\nEasier consumer budgeting.\nAs digital payments are made, transactions are kept in records. Cashless payments facilitate the tracking of spending expenditure and record the movement of money. Having recorded transactions, it can help citizens to refine their budget more efficiently because people can see there recorded transactions in their bank account and know where their ingoings and outgoings are occurring.\nConcerns.\nLack of privacy.\nIn a digitized economy, payment made will be traceable. With traceable transactions, institutions would have potential access to this information. With these digital traces left behind, digital transactions become vulnerable. Such transactions allow businesses a way to build a consumer's personal profiles based on their spending patterns. The issue of &lt;a href=\"data%20mining\"&gt;data mining&lt;/a&gt; also comes into place as countries head towards a cashless society. Cashless transactions leave a record in the database of the company as one makes a payment, and this information becomes a way for the prediction of future events. Through a large number of records, data mining then allows the organization to compile a profile of an individual through its records in the database.\nGoing all-digital, these data retrieved from transactions lead to widespread surveillance where individuals can be tracked by both corporations and the government. These records might also be available to hackers and could be made public after a &lt;a href=\"data%20breach\"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;.\nProblems for the unbanked.\nCashless systems can be problematic for people who currently rely on cash, who are concentrated in certain populations such as the poor, disabled, elderly, &lt;a href=\"undocumented%20immigrants\"&gt;undocumented immigrants&lt;/a&gt;, and youth. Electronic transactions require a deposit account (in a bank or other deposit-taking financial institution) and some familiarity with the payment system. Many people in impoverished areas are &lt;a href=\"underbanked\"&gt;underbanked&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"unbanked\"&gt;unbanked&lt;/a&gt;. In the United States, almost one-third of the population lacked the full range of basic financial services in 2012. In 2011, an FDIC survey found that approximately one-quarter of households whose annual income was less than $15,000 had no bank account. Nationwide, 7.7% of people in United States did not have bank accounts, with levels over 20% in some cities and rural counties, and over 40% in some &lt;a href=\"census%20tract\"&gt;census tract&lt;/a&gt;s, as of 2016.\nAs part of its &lt;a href=\"Smart%20Nation\"&gt;Smart Nation&lt;/a&gt; initiative, Singapore has been moving towards a cashless economy. In 2017, 14.4% of the country's population was over 65 years old, and the majority of seniors still used cash as their only method of payment. Not used to digital payment methods, troubleshooting issues such as managing lost cards or passwords and managing their expenses can create potential trouble for anyone transitioning from cash.\nDigital fraud.\nWhen payment transactions are stored in servers, it increases the risks of unauthorized breaches by hackers. Financial cyber attacks and digital crime also form a greater risks when going cashless. Many companies already suffer &lt;a href=\"data%20breach\"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;es, including of payment systems. Electronic accounts are vulnerable to unauthorized access and transfer of funds to another account or unauthorized purchases.\nAttacks on or accidental outages of telecommunication infrastructure also prevent electronic payments from working, unlike cash transactions which can continue with minimal infrastructure.\nCentralized control.\nOpponents point out that an entirely cashless system, in addition to tracking all transactions, would enable a central government to:\nCriticism in Sweden.\n&lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best examples of the results of efforts to create a cashless society. Sweden is exceptional in that the amount of cash in circulation has reduced substantially. Swedish society changed profoundly from 2000 to 2017 due to attempts to replace all cash with digital payment methods. The concept of cash-free bank branches began in Sweden between 2000 and 2005, with a cashless branch being a step towards an upcoming closure of that branch. From around 2008, Swedish banks began giving special hardware to their customers that could be used to process financial transactions (like digital payments of invoices) from home. People still had the choice to use cash, however, and those who so wished could still do business in cash at the bank offices that remained.\nThis trend began around 2008, and peaked in connection with the 2015-17 exchange of all Swedish coins and banknotes (except for the 10 kronor coin). According to the banks' head offices, cash was no longer required as withdrawals and deposits were possible (in limited amounts) through machines. But for \"safety regulations\", the maximum amount a bank customer could withdraw was about 5,000 to 10,000 &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20krona\"&gt;SEK&lt;/a&gt; per week, and similar \"security rules\" for deposits were established as well. Later, all the major regular banks with branches began an enforced process of either closing down branches or making them \"cash-free\". Today very few cash handling bank branches still exist.\nThe limited availability of cash in Sweden has caused difficulties for smaller boutiques, shops, and convenience stores, which depend on cash, as they can no longer deposit their daily takings or obtain any change. Non-profit organisations, which are very common in Sweden, have also experienced an outsized impact. In response, Swedish banks have introduced a mobile telephone payment system known as &lt;a href=\"Swish%20%28payment%29\"&gt;Swish&lt;/a&gt;. But this system has suffered from many problems.\nThe banks (and initially media as well) have dismissed complaints about the change as \"a problem for elderly people\" only, essentially claiming that some were only struggling to learn new technology, rather than being unhappy with a totally new transaction method. Opponents of the change, however, contend that the technological excitement has changed too much too fast, saying that many dangers lurk in the reeds. Concerns have been expressed about a rising number of fraudulent transactions, and the fast development of &lt;a href=\"quantum%20computer\"&gt;quantum computer&lt;/a&gt;s contributes to fears of hacking within the system. The debate about a cashless Sweden became more complicated when the Swedish authority \"Myndigheten f\u00f6r Samh\u00e4llsskydd och Beredskap\u2014MSB\" or \"the Authority for Community Protection and Preparedness\" in their writing \"Om Kriget Eller Krisen Kommer\" (\"If war or crisis comes\") contained a list of items to store permanently at home to be prepared, which includes \"cash in small denominations\". A wave of negative criticism followed in Sweden from experts outside the banking sphere expressing their concerns.\nThe former head of police, &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rn%20Eriksson%20%28civil%20servant%29\"&gt;Bj\u00f6rn Eriksson&lt;/a&gt;, started a movement in the spring of 2016 known as \"Kontantupproret\" or \"The Cash Petition\". This movement has quickly grown to a considerable size, with many contributors describing troubles caused by the increasingly hostile attitude expressed by banks against cash. The range of complaints covers a wide variety of issues. For instance, the well-known TV3 figure &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Aschberg\"&gt;Robert Aschberg&lt;/a&gt; got mad after having paid at a chemist with the Swish system via his mobile phone, because he almost immediately received an advertisement from the same pharmacy, raising privacy concerns. Svante Linusson, professor of mathematics, claims that \"the liquidation of cash is slowly destroying our democracy\". A billiard club in &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6\"&gt;Malm\u00f6&lt;/a&gt; was almost forced to close after their bank of 20 years refused to acknowledge them as a customer after the billiard club refused any other payments but cash (the bank claimed that the cash is not traceable in their crime investigation activities). A traditional summer market in northern &lt;a href=\"Lycksele\"&gt;Lycksele&lt;/a&gt; went into bankruptcy after a computer error. Because people had been required to pay with phones (Swish) and cards, there was not enough money available for them to conduct business in their market.\nIn general new &lt;a href=\"money%20laundry\"&gt;money laundry&lt;/a&gt; laws require evidence of sources for higher amounts of cash. The banks in Sweden blame EU laws, but the EU laws allow transactions of below \u20ac15,000, while Swedish banks require evidence and can refuse to accept or confiscate cash without lower limit and have high requirements of documentation."
