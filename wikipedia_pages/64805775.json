    "text": "Estrella Navarro-Holm is a &lt;a href=\"Marine%20biology\"&gt;marine biologist&lt;/a&gt;, model, and national record-holding &lt;a href=\"Freediving\"&gt;free diver&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. She is the first Latin American woman to win a free diving medal for holding a single breath for more than six minutes.\nEarly life and education.\nNavarro is from &lt;a href=\"La%20Paz%2C%20Baja%20California%20Sur\"&gt;La Paz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baja%20California%20Sur\"&gt;Baja California Sur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Her father, a swim-coach, taught her to swim at an early age. Navarro began modeling when she was 15 years old and placed sixth in &lt;a href=\"Mexicana%20Universal\"&gt;Nuestra Belleza M\u00e9xico&lt;/a&gt; in 2008.\nShe earned a degree in &lt;a href=\"marine%20biology\"&gt;marine biology&lt;/a&gt;, specializing in &lt;a href=\"shark\"&gt;shark&lt;/a&gt; biology and &lt;a href=\"ecology\"&gt;ecology&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20University%20of%20Baja%20California%20Sur\"&gt;Autonomous University of Baja California Sur&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nNavarro was scouted and initially trained by freediving instructor &lt;a href=\"Aharon%20Solomons\"&gt;Aharon Solomons&lt;/a&gt;. Three months after beginning to learn the breathing and ear-equalizing techniques necessary for freediving, she broke a national Mexican record. In 2010, Navarro began training with Italian coach Andrea Zuccari. She can hold her breath for many minutes and regularly dives deeper than 55 meters. She also participates in conservation efforts by appearing in documentaries and other media. And she works as an underwater and fashion model.\nIn 2015, Navarro founded and organized the Big Blue freediving competition in her home state. It is the first international freediving competition in Baja Sur and promotes &lt;a href=\"marine%20conservation\"&gt;marine conservation&lt;/a&gt;. The event takes place in the waters off of &lt;a href=\"Isla%20Esp%C3%ADritu%20Santo\"&gt;Isla Esp\u00edritu Santo&lt;/a&gt;, Baja, Mexico. She organized it in cooperation with &lt;a href=\"AIDA%20International\"&gt;AIDA Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and diving equipment manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Cressi-Sub\"&gt;Cressi&lt;/a&gt;. Inaugural attendees were to include &lt;a href=\"Alexey%20Molchanov\"&gt;Alexey Molchanov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Natalia%20Molchanova\"&gt;Natalia Molchanova&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Coste\"&gt;Carlos Coste&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecords.\nNavarro has won two international freediving medals. She is the first woman from Mexico to win a medal at the &lt;a href=\"AIDA%20International\"&gt;AIDA&lt;/a&gt; Individual Depth World Championships, the world championships of free diving. She won the bronze medal in the Constant Weight No Fins (CNF) category against 150 other divers.\nNavarro has broken national free diving records for Mexico 26 times. In the 2015 Caribbean Cup in &lt;a href=\"Roat%C3%A1n\"&gt;Roatan, Honduras&lt;/a&gt;, she broke three diving records for Mexico.\nIn 2017, Navarro dove to a depth of 75 meters in &lt;a href=\"Sharm%20El%20Sheikh\"&gt;Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt&lt;/a&gt; in the Free Immersion (FIM) and Constant Weight Fins (CWT) categories. The record dive was validated by AIDA International at the Freediving World Apnea Center. She made the dive with a single large fin called a &lt;a href=\"monofin\"&gt;monofin&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2019, Navarro broke another record for Mexico, diving 60 meters with &lt;a href=\"Swimfin\"&gt;bi-fins&lt;/a&gt; as part of the M\u00e9xico en Buceo Libre competition in waters off of &lt;a href=\"Bacalar\"&gt;Bacalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quintana%20Roo\"&gt;Quintaana Roo&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos of her diving are available."
