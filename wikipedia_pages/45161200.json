    "text": "Martha Hatfield (or \"Hatfeild\") (also known as The Wise Virgin) (born 27 September 1640) was an English &lt;a href=\"Puritan\"&gt;Puritan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"prophet\"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt;.\nHatfield was born in &lt;a href=\"Leighton%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Leighton, North Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, England in the 17th century, daughter of Anthony Hatfield (1598-1655/6; the family name is more commonly encountered as \"Hatfeild\"), of &lt;a href=\"Laughton-en-le-Morthen\"&gt;Laughton-en-le-Morthen&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Rotherham\"&gt;Rotherham&lt;/a&gt;, and Faith (d. 1659), daughter of George Westby, of Gilthwaite, Rotherham. The Hatfield family were Yorkshire gentry, originally of &lt;a href=\"Ecclesfield\"&gt;Ecclesfield&lt;/a&gt;, coming to own the manor of &lt;a href=\"Thorp%20Arch\"&gt;Thorp Arch&lt;/a&gt; in the eighteenth century through marriage with the Gossip family of that place.\nIn April 1652, Hatfield became ill with a type of &lt;a href=\"catalepsy\"&gt;catalepsy&lt;/a&gt;. She became &lt;a href=\"paralyzed\"&gt;paralyzed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blindness\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"deaf\"&gt;deaf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"muteness\"&gt;mute&lt;/a&gt;. This lasted for seventeen days. When she recovered she began \"rambling\" about religious subjects and started quoting &lt;a href=\"scriptures\"&gt;scriptures&lt;/a&gt;. What she said was documented by John and Peter, the songs of &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Rodes\"&gt;Edward Rodes&lt;/a&gt;, and another man named John Cromwell. On 8 September 1652 she became mute again. She remained mute until 7 December 1652. However, her second recovery did not have any prophetic moments.\nIn 1653, her uncle, James Fisher, who founded the first &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian\"&gt;Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt; church in &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%2C%20England\"&gt;Sheffield, England&lt;/a&gt;, wrote a book about Hatfield and her prophetic dialogue called \"The Wise Virgin\". The book was a best seller and was reprinted multiple times."
