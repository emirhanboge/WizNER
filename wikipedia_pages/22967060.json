    "text": "Mount Clague is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Kitimat%20Ranges\"&gt;Kitimat Ranges&lt;/a&gt; of western &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, located west of the junction of &lt;a href=\"Wedeene%20River\"&gt;Wedeene River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kitimat%20River\"&gt;Kitimat River&lt;/a&gt;, just northwest of &lt;a href=\"Kitimat%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Kitimat&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mountain was originally named Mount Claque in 1951 in association with the misspelled name of the triangulation station which had been occupied and named in 1949. The mountain's name was corrected in 1968. Herbert Naden Clague was a BC land surveyor who laid out the subdivision schema of Kitimat in 1910."
