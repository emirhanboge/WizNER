    "text": "Adenanthos ellipticus, commonly known as the oval-leaf adenanthos, is a &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; from the family &lt;a href=\"Proteaceae\"&gt;Proteaceae&lt;/a&gt; that is &lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; where it is considered to be Declared Rare Flora.\nDescription.\n\"Adenanthos ellipticus\" grows as an open spreading shrub to 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) high and 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) wide. The leaves are long by wide, while the orange or reddish-pink coloured &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are long.\nTaxonomy.\n&lt;a href=\"Alex%20George\"&gt;Alex George&lt;/a&gt; described \"Adenanthos ellipticus\" in 1974, the species name derived from the &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; adjective \"ellipticus\" and referring to the shape of the leaves. It had been collected much earlier, in 1931 by &lt;a href=\"William%20Blackall\"&gt;W.E.Blackall&lt;/a&gt;. He published the name \"A. cuneata\" var. \"integra\" in 1954 but did not write a description so the name is invalid. It is classified in the &lt;a href=\"Section%20%28botany%29\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; \"Adenanthos\" within the genus of the same name.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Adenanthos ellipticus\" is found only in &lt;a href=\"Fitzgerald%20River%20National%20Park\"&gt;Fitzgerald River National Park&lt;/a&gt;, where it occurs in three populations occupying an area of less than 0.31 square kilometres (77 acres). It grows in &lt;a href=\"quartzite\"&gt;quartzite&lt;/a&gt;-derived siliceous &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; on rocky hillsides. It is found in association with coastal jugflower (\"&lt;a href=\"Adenanthos%20cuneatus\"&gt;Adenanthos cuneatus&lt;/a&gt;\") and veined adenanthos (\"&lt;a href=\"Adenanthos%20venosus\"&gt;A. venosus&lt;/a&gt;\"), but generally grows higher up slopes than those species.\nEcology.\n\"Adenanthos ellipticus\" is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed afterwards. Fires at short intervals threaten to eradicate it. It is also highly sensitive to dieback (\"&lt;a href=\"Phytophthora%20cinnamomi\"&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/a&gt;\").\nStatus.\nThe Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments have classified \"Adenanthos ellipticus\" as \"vulnerable\" under the &lt;a href=\"Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999\"&gt;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 and &lt;a href=\"Wildlife%20Conservation%20Act%201950\"&gt;Wildlife Conservation Act 1950&lt;/a&gt; (Western Australia) in November 2012 respectively.\nCultivation.\n\"Adenanthos ellipticus\" is unknown in cultivation, and has little horticultural potential, especially compared with the smaller, more compact \"A. cuneatus\". It would likely need frequent pruning to maintain an attractive appearance."
