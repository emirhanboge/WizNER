    "text": "The Welsh National Water Development Authority (WNWDA) (\"Awdurdod Cenedlaethol Datblygu Dwr Cymru\" in &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt;) and later the Welsh Water Authority was one of ten &lt;a href=\"regional%20water%20authority\"&gt;regional water authorities&lt;/a&gt; set up in the &lt;a href=\"UK\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and came into existence on 6 August 1973 with its headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Brecon\"&gt;Brecon&lt;/a&gt;. by virtue of the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Act%201973\"&gt;Water Act 1973&lt;/a&gt;\nIt took over the sewerage and sewage disposal responsibilities of the local authorities within its area, the roles and responsibilities of the six existing River Authorities in Wales and most of the water supply undertakings. The authority was dissolved in 1989 as part of the &lt;a href=\"Water%20privatisation%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;privatisation of the water industry&lt;/a&gt;.\nRemit.\nIt brought together all the &lt;a href=\"sewage%20disposal\"&gt;sewage disposal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sewerage\"&gt;sewerage&lt;/a&gt; functions from the following local authorities:\nIt took over the &lt;a href=\"water%20supply\"&gt;water supply&lt;/a&gt; functions previously held by &lt;a href=\"Local%20authority\"&gt;local authorities&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; which were:\nPrivate water companies such as &lt;a href=\"Chester%20Water\"&gt;Chester Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrexham%20Water%20Company\"&gt;Wrexham Water Company&lt;/a&gt; were excluded and continued in operation.\nIt also subsumed all the functions of the six &lt;a href=\"river%20authority\"&gt;river authorities&lt;/a&gt; in Wales \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Wye%20River%20Authority\"&gt;Wye River Authority&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Usk%20River%20Authority\"&gt;Usk River Authority&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Glamorgan%20River%20Authority\"&gt;Glamorgan River Authority&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"South%20West%20Wales%20River%20Authority\"&gt;South West Wales River Authority&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gwynedd%20River%20Authority\"&gt;Gwynedd River Authority&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dee%20and%20Clwyd%20River%20Authority\"&gt;Dee and Clwyd River Authority&lt;/a&gt;. The boundary of WNWDA was identical to that of the constituent river authorities and included parts of England in both the &lt;a href=\"River%20Wye\"&gt;River Wye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Dee%20%28Wales%29\"&gt;River Dee&lt;/a&gt; catchments. \nOrganisation.\nAt inception, WNWDA was organised in units that broadly reflected the originating business. Thus sewerage and sewage disposal was organised into a number of sewage divisions, water supply was similarly formed into a number of water divisions and river divisions exactly matching the roles and boundaries of the previous river authorities were created.\nIn 1984 a major re-structuring brought all the functions together in three multidisciplinary divisions, with a headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Brecon\"&gt;Brecon&lt;/a&gt;. These were the South Eastern Division based in &lt;a href=\"Nelson%2C%20Caerphilly\"&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, South Western Division based in &lt;a href=\"Haverfordwest\"&gt;Haverfordwest&lt;/a&gt;, the Northern Division based in &lt;a href=\"Bangor%2C%20Gwynedd\"&gt;Bangor&lt;/a&gt;. There were sub-offices located in Hereford, Monmouth, Swansea, Lampeter, Caernarfon and Mold. At the time of this re-organisation the name of the authority changed to Welsh Water Authority.\nGovernance.\nThe authority was governed by a board which included representatives from local authorities, central government and the major industries in Wales including agriculture. The chairman appointed by the government of the day was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Brecon\"&gt;Lord Brecon&lt;/a&gt; but he was replaced by T. M. Haydn Rees in 1976 and then by &lt;a href=\"John%20Elfed%20Jones\"&gt;John Elfed Jones&lt;/a&gt; in 1982.\nPrivatisation.\nIn 1989 the water supply, sewerage, and sewage disposal functions of the authority were privatised to form &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Water\"&gt;Welsh Water&lt;/a&gt; with the regulatory and control functions passing to the newly created &lt;a href=\"National%20Rivers%20Authority\"&gt;National Rivers Authority&lt;/a&gt;."
