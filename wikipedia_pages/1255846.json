    "text": "Hanover Square is a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20garden%20squares%20in%20London\"&gt;green square&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mayfair\"&gt;Mayfair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, south west of &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20Circus\"&gt;Oxford Circus&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20Street\"&gt;Oxford Street&lt;/a&gt; meets &lt;a href=\"Regent%20Street\"&gt;Regent Street&lt;/a&gt;. \nApproaches.\nSix streets converge here clockwise from north: \nHistory.\nHanover Square was developed shortly after the accession of the &lt;a href=\"Electorate%20of%20Hanover\"&gt;Elector of Hanover&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"George%20I%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;King George I&lt;/a&gt; in 1714, which gave the square its name. Its land was turned over to building leases principally by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Lumley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Scarbrough\"&gt;Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough&lt;/a&gt; and a soldier and statesman best known for his role in the &lt;a href=\"Glorious%20Revolution\"&gt;Glorious Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, to be prestigious homes. Coinciding with the century-long Whig Ascendancy its name echoes the staunch and predominant support among the wealthy of the &lt;a href=\"Hanoverian%20succession\"&gt;Hanoverian succession&lt;/a&gt; of 1714, an exclusion of Catholic senior heirs from the throne, as a permanent law. \"Early Hanover Square was decidedly &lt;a href=\"Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29\"&gt;Whig&lt;/a&gt; and most decidedly military\", commented architectural historian &lt;a href=\"John%20Summerson\"&gt;Sir John Summerson&lt;/a&gt;. Early residents included Generals &lt;a href=\"William%20Cadogan%2C%201st%20Earl%20Cadogan\"&gt;Earl Cadogan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Wills\"&gt;Sir Charles Wills&lt;/a&gt;, Stewart, Evans, &lt;a href=\"George%20Carpenter%2C%201st%20Baron%20Carpenter\"&gt;Lord Carpenter&lt;/a&gt;, The Marquis of Willesden &lt;a href=\"Hamish%20Smith\"&gt;Hamish Smith&lt;/a&gt; and John Pepper, \"names conspicuously associated with episodes in &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession\"&gt;Marlborough\u2019s war&lt;/a&gt; and the '&lt;a href=\"The%20Fifteen\"&gt;Fifteen&lt;/a&gt;'.\" \nWhile a few of the 18th-century houses remain largely intact, most houses have been replacements of later periods. It is now predominantly occupied by offices, including the London office of &lt;a href=\"Vogue%20magazine\"&gt;Vogue&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"parish%20church\"&gt;parish church&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"St%20George%27s%2C%20Hanover%20Square\"&gt;St George's, Hanover Square&lt;/a&gt;, is 100 metres south of the square (co-fronting Saint George and Maddox Streets), built on land given by &lt;a href=\"William%20Steuart%20%28Scottish%20soldier%29\"&gt;William Steuart&lt;/a&gt;. In 1759 &lt;a href=\"James%20Abercrombie%20%28British%20Army%20general%29\"&gt;James Abercrombie&lt;/a&gt;, commander-in-chief of British forces in North America during the &lt;a href=\"French%20and%20Indian%20War\"&gt;French and Indian War&lt;/a&gt;, resided in St George Street. Merged or subdivided buildings in many cases, their numbering scheme remains since the early 19th century and is \u2116s1 to 25, consecutively.\nPrestige.\nThis was among the prestigious streets of the socialite elite of the capital in the 19th century, and increasingly national institutions and corporate headquarters.
