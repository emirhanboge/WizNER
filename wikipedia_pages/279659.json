    "text": "Lemuel \"Francis\" Abbott (1760/61 \u2013 5 December 1803) was an English &lt;a href=\"Portrait%20painting\"&gt;portrait painter&lt;/a&gt;, famous for his painting of &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson\"&gt;Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson&lt;/a&gt; (currently hanging in the Terracotta Room of number &lt;a href=\"10%20Downing%20Street\"&gt;10 Downing Street&lt;/a&gt;) and for those of other &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;naval officers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"British%20literature\"&gt;literary figures&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"18th%20century%20in%20literature\"&gt;18th century&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nHe was born Lemuel Abbott in &lt;a href=\"Leicestershire\"&gt;Leicestershire&lt;/a&gt; in 1760 or 1761, the son of clergyman &lt;a href=\"Lemuel%20Abbott\"&gt;Lemuel Abbott&lt;/a&gt;, curate of &lt;a href=\"Anstey%2C%20Leicestershire\"&gt;Anstey&lt;/a&gt; (and later vicar of &lt;a href=\"Thornton%2C%20Leicestershire\"&gt;Thornton&lt;/a&gt;) and his wife Mary. In 1775, at the age of 14, he became a pupil of &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Hayman\"&gt;Francis Hayman&lt;/a&gt; and lived in London, but returned to his parents after his teacher's death in 1776. There he continued to develop his artistic talents independently, but some authorities have suggested that he may also have studied with &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Wright%20of%20Derby\"&gt;Joseph Wright of Derby&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1780, Abbott married Anna Maria, and again settled in London, residing for many years in Caroline Street in &lt;a href=\"Bloomsbury\"&gt;Bloomsbury&lt;/a&gt;. Although he exhibited at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Academy\"&gt;Royal Academy&lt;/a&gt;, he never became an Academician. It is said that overwork, due to the commissions he took on, and domestic unhappiness led to his becoming insane. He was declared insane in 1798, and was treated by Dr &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Munro\"&gt;Thomas Munro&lt;/a&gt; (1759\u20131833), the chief physician to &lt;a href=\"Bethlem%20Hospital\"&gt;Bethlem Hospital&lt;/a&gt; and a specialist in mental disorders \u2013 Munro also treated King &lt;a href=\"George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;George III&lt;/a&gt; (1738\u20131820).\nAbbott died in London on 5 December 1803.\nWorks.\nAbbott painted portraits of many figures of the day. His 1797 portrait of Horatio Nelson was commenced during a period where both men were living in the same lodgings in London's Bond Street. The finished work won the approval of both Nelson and his wife, with lady Nelson writing that \"[T]he likeliness is great; I am well pleased with Abbott.\" While the Nelson portrait was Abbott's most famous work, other subjects of the period included Admiral Sir &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Calder\"&gt;Robert Calder&lt;/a&gt;, Rear-Admiral Sir &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Pasley\"&gt;Thomas Pasley&lt;/a&gt; and Captain &lt;a href=\"William%20Locker%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;William Locker&lt;/a&gt;, astronomer Sir &lt;a href=\"William%20Herschel\"&gt;William Herschel&lt;/a&gt;, poet &lt;a href=\"William%20Cowper\"&gt;William Cowper&lt;/a&gt;, artists &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Bartolozzi\"&gt;Francesco Bartolozzi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Nollekens\"&gt;Joseph Nollekens&lt;/a&gt;, entrepreneur &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Boulton\"&gt;Matthew Boulton&lt;/a&gt; and industrialist &lt;a href=\"John%20Wilkinson%20%28industrialist%29\"&gt;John Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis portrait of Henry Callender, Captain General of the Royal Blackheath Golf Club, is one of the earliest portrayals of the game of &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;. Reproductions hang in golf clubs the world over. It was sold at &lt;a href=\"Bonhams\"&gt;Bonhams&lt;/a&gt; in London on 9 December 2015.\nSome of his paintings were signed \"Francis Lemuel Abbott\", but it is not known why he assumed the additional Christian name, as it was not one with which he was baptised.\nOther famous paintings include, that off one addressed as follows:\nTo the society of goffers at Blackheath this plate is with just respect Dedicated by their most humble servant, Lemuel Francis Abbott\nIt is signed painted by L.F.Abbott 1790.\nIt is reported to be that of a Captain William Innes and a pensioner.\nCaptain Innes was as the story goes, an avid fan of the society of goffers."
