    "text": "The shy heathwren (\"Hylacola cauta\") is a species of small &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; in the family &lt;a href=\"Acanthizidae\"&gt;Acanthizidae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. They inhabit mostly &lt;a href=\"Mallee%20%28habit%29\"&gt;mallee&lt;/a&gt; woodland that has relatively dense shrub and &lt;a href=\"Heath%20%28habitat%29\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt; understorey. Shy heathwrens feed mostly on ground dwelling insects, and rarely on seeds. Their ground level nests are dome-shaped and usually concealed within grass &lt;a href=\"Bunch%20grass\"&gt;tussocks&lt;/a&gt; or shrubs. Within the nest they typically lay 2\u20133 freckled and pinkish eggs.\nThe birds are cock-tailed with a chestnut rump that darkens towards the tip. Their feathers are white with brown streaking underneath and greyish-brown on the back and crown. They have a white eyebrow, tail tip and patch on the &lt;a href=\"flight%20feather\"&gt;flight feather&lt;/a&gt;s, and a black &lt;a href=\"Beak\"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt;. Their eyes are brown to yellowish-brown and legs are slate-brown. Females have slightly duller colouring, and immature birds are duller again with some of these being fawn-coloured underneath. They have a total length when adults of .\nThey are uncommon residents across a wide part of southern Australia. Ranging from near &lt;a href=\"West%20Wyalong%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;West Wyalong&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Murchison%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Murchison River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. In New South Wales, they are found in two isolated populations: one between &lt;a href=\"Leeton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Leeton&lt;/a&gt;, Willandra, &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nymagee%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Nymagee&lt;/a&gt; and West Wyalong; and the other from &lt;a href=\"Balranald%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Balranald&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Trentham%20Cliffs%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Trentham Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;. Within the state they are seen as a &lt;a href=\"threatened\"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vulnerable%20species\"&gt;vulnerable&lt;/a&gt;, largely due to human-wrought &lt;a href=\"Habitat%20destruction\"&gt;habitat loss&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"predation\"&gt;predation&lt;/a&gt; by foxes and cats.\nTheir &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20taxonomy\"&gt;taxonomic&lt;/a&gt; name was formerly \"Calamanthus cautus\"\u2014classing them as fieldwrens\u2014until they were renamed in 2008. The generic name \"Hylacola\" derives from the Greek \"hyl\u0113\" 'woodland' and the Latin \"-cola\" 'dweller'. The specific epithet derives from the Latin \"cautus\" 'shy, wary'. Common names for the species include shy hylacola and mallee heathwren. Four subspecies have been recognised: the nominate subspecies \"Hylacola cauta cauta\" in South Australia and Victoria; \"H. c. macrorhynchus\" in New South Wales; \"H. c. halmaturina\" on &lt;a href=\"Kangaroo%20Island\"&gt;Kangaroo Island&lt;/a&gt;; and \"H. c. whitlocki\" in Western Australia. \nReferences.\n "
