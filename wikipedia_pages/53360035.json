    "text": "Antiguraleus infandus is a species of &lt;a href=\"sea%20snail\"&gt;sea snail&lt;/a&gt;, a marine &lt;a href=\"gastropod\"&gt;gastropod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mollusk\"&gt;mollusk&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mangeliidae\"&gt;Mangeliidae&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe length of the shell attains 6\u00a0mm, its diameter 3\u00a0mm.\n(Original description) The shell is white and chalky. It contains 5 rounded &lt;a href=\"Whorl%20%28mollusc%29\"&gt;whorl&lt;/a&gt;s, including a smooth &lt;a href=\"protoconch\"&gt;protoconch&lt;/a&gt; of about 1\u00bd whorl. The shell is longitudinally vertically ribbed, the ribs strong right up to the\nsuture and persisting faintly down the base. The &lt;a href=\"body%20whorl\"&gt;body whorl&lt;/a&gt; shows about nine ribs. Strong spirals cross the ribs, two on the second whorl, three above the &lt;a href=\"Aperture%20%28mollusc%29\"&gt;aperture&lt;/a&gt;, a fourth and faint fifth on the body-whorl. The sutures of the early whorls are sharp. of those succeeding concavely rounded. The base is spirally striated. The type is worn\u2014the protoconch damaged, and the outer &lt;a href=\"Lip%20%28gastropod%29\"&gt;lip&lt;/a&gt; broken away for a quarter of a whorl. There are spiral striations between the main spirals, and these are strongest on the somewhat hollow infrasutural tabulation. There is no anal fasciole.\nDistribution.\nThis marine species occurs off &lt;a href=\"Great%20Barrier%20Island\"&gt;Great Barrier Island&lt;/a&gt;, New Zealand."
