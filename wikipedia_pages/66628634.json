It was decided to create a new single-elimination competition reserved for the teams from the lower categories.\nThe first season of the cup started in October 2020 and it was interrupted and later declared cancelled on 9 April 2021 due to the decision of the MFA to stop all the competitions because of &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Malta\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic in Malta&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Munxar%20Falcons%20F.C.\"&gt;Munxar Falcons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C5%BBebbu%C4%A1%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;\u017bebbu\u0121 Rovers&lt;/a&gt; were the first two &lt;a href=\"Gozo\"&gt;Gozitan&lt;/a&gt; teams that played in the competition."
