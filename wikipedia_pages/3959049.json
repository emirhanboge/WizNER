    "text": "Aku Ankka (&lt;a href=\"Finnish%20language\"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Duck\"&gt;Donald Duck&lt;/a&gt;) is a &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; weekly &lt;a href=\"Disney%20comics\"&gt;Disney comic book&lt;/a&gt; published by Sanoma Magazines since 1951.\nHistory and profile.\nThe first issue of \"Aku Ankka\" was published on 5 December 1951 and sold 34,017 copies. The first issue, with a special &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; theme, and the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20White\"&gt;Snow White&lt;/a&gt; story published later in the 1950s are very prized collectors' items and can fetch a price of several thousand &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s on the collector market. The magazine was published monthly until 1956, twice a month between 1956 and 1960, and every Wednesday since 1961.\n\"Aku Ankka\" is published by Sanoma Media (formerly Sanoma Magazines), which is part of &lt;a href=\"Sanoma\"&gt;Sanoma&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite being part of a multinational franchise and despite most stories being translations into Finnish of stories first published abroad, \"Aku Ankka\" has become a cultural icon in Finland. This is largely due to the magazine's colourful and innovative use of the Finnish language. Many characters' names are Finnish language spoofs of the names of celebrities. In 2001, in recognition of its work for the Finnish language, the editorial team was given the \"Kielihelmi\" award by the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20language\"&gt;Finnish language&lt;/a&gt; department of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Helsinki\"&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe \"Aku Ankka\" comic is now more popular in Finland than in the country of its origin, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; (where Disney is better known for its cartoons and films than comics). The US Donald Duck cartoonist &lt;a href=\"Don%20Rosa\"&gt;Don Rosa&lt;/a&gt; is exceptionally popular in Finland, and he has acknowledged this by creating \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Quest%20for%20Kalevala\"&gt;The Quest for Kalevala&lt;/a&gt;\", a Donald Duck story specifically set in Finland.\nThere is a popular &lt;a href=\"urban%20legend\"&gt;urban legend&lt;/a&gt; that Donald Duck was once banned in Finland for not wearing pants. This myth was sparked by an incident in 1977, when &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; councilman Matti Holopainen proposed discontinuing the use of city funds to subscribe to \"Aku Ankka\" comics for &lt;a href=\"youth%20center\"&gt;youth center&lt;/a&gt;s, due to the city's financial difficulties. The following year, when Holopainen was running for a &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Finland\"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt; seat, his opponent, called him \"the man who banned Donald Duck from Helsinki\" and Holopainen lost the election. &lt;a href=\"National%20Coalition%20Party\"&gt;National Coalition Party&lt;/a&gt; politician &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Zyskowicz\"&gt;Ben Zyskowicz&lt;/a&gt; called Holopainen's decision \"an accident at work\".\nA similar incident had taken place a few years earlier in &lt;a href=\"Kemi\"&gt;Kemi&lt;/a&gt;, and international reports exaggerated the situation in claims that the character's attire and his extramarital relationship with &lt;a href=\"Daisy%20Duck\"&gt;Daisy Duck&lt;/a&gt; were the causes of the local ban.\nCirculation.\n\"Aku Ankka\" is one of the most popular weekly publications in Finland as well as the world's largest edition per capita of a Donald Duck magazine.\nIt had a circulation of 320,500 in 2006, 324,000 in 2007, and 306,555 in 2010. Its circulation of 282,794 in 2012 made it the third most popular magazine in Finland. When 260,455 copies were sold in 2013, it became the best-selling Finnish magazine."
