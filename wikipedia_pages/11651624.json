    "text": "The Shah-Armens (lit. 'Kings of Armenia', ), also known as Ahlatshahs (lit. 'Rulers of Ahlat', ), was a 11th- and 12th-century Turcoman &lt;a href=\"Anatolian%20beylik\"&gt;beylik&lt;/a&gt; founded after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Manzikert\"&gt;Battle of Manzikert&lt;/a&gt; (1071) and centred in &lt;a href=\"Ahlat\"&gt;Ahlat&lt;/a&gt; on the northwestern shore of the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Van\"&gt;Lake Van&lt;/a&gt;. This region comprised most of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Bitlis%20Province\"&gt;Bitlis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Van%20Province\"&gt;Van&lt;/a&gt;, and parts of &lt;a href=\"Mu%C5%9F%20Province\"&gt;Mu\u015f&lt;/a&gt; provinces.\nThe dynasty is sometimes also called \"S\u00f6kmenli\" in reference to the founder of the principality, &lt;a href=\"S%C3%B6kmen%20el-Kutb%C3%AE\"&gt;S\u00f6kmen el-Kutb\u00ee&lt;/a&gt;, literally \"S\u00f6kmen the Slave\", one of the commanders of the &lt;a href=\"Seljuq%20dynasty\"&gt;Great Seljuq&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alp%20Arslan\"&gt;Alp Arslan&lt;/a&gt;. The Ahlatshah S\u00f6kmenli should not be confused with the &lt;a href=\"Artuqid\"&gt;Artuqid&lt;/a&gt; branch of S\u00f6kmenli, which ruled in &lt;a href=\"Hasankeyf\"&gt;Hasankeyf&lt;/a&gt; during approximately the same period.\nAnother title S\u00f6kmen and his descendants assumed, as heirs to the local &lt;a href=\"Armenians\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; princes according to &lt;a href=\"Clifford%20Edmund%20Bosworth\"&gt;Clifford Edmund Bosworth&lt;/a&gt;, was the Persian title \"Shah-i Arman\" (\"Shah of Armenia\"), often rendered as \"Ermenshahs\". This dynastic name, which the Turkmen rulers adopted, was established through the \"ethnic make-up and political history\" of the region they ruled, which was primarily Armenian.\nThe Beylik was founded by the Turkmen &lt;a href=\"ghilman\"&gt;slave commander&lt;/a&gt; S\u00f6kmen who took over Ahlat (\"Khliat\" or \"Khilat\") in 1100. Ahlatshahs were closely tied to Great Seljuq institutions, although they also followed independent policies like the wars against &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; in alliance with their neighbours to the north, the &lt;a href=\"Saltukids\"&gt;Saltukids&lt;/a&gt;. They also acquired links with the branch of the &lt;a href=\"Artuqid%20dynasty\"&gt;Artuqid dynasty&lt;/a&gt; based in Meyyafarikin (now &lt;a href=\"Silvan%2C%20Turkey\"&gt;Silvan&lt;/a&gt;), becoming part of a nexus of Turkmen principalities in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mesopotamia\"&gt;Upper Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt; and Eastern Anatolia.\nThe Ahlatshahs reached their brightest period under the fifty-seven-year reign of S\u00f6kmen II (1128\u20131185). He was married to a female relative (daughter or sister) of the Saltukid ruler &lt;a href=\"Saltuk%20II\"&gt;Saltuk II&lt;/a&gt;. Since S\u00f6kmen II was childless, the \"beylik\" was seized by a series of slave commanders after his death. In 1207, the \"beylik\" was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Ayyubids\"&gt;Ayyubids&lt;/a&gt;, who had long coveted Ahlat. The Ayyubids had come to the city at the invitation of people of Ahlat after the last S\u00f6kmenli ruler was killed by Tu\u011frulshah, the ruler (\"melik\") of &lt;a href=\"Erzurum\"&gt;Erzurum&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20R%C3%BBm\"&gt;Sultanate of R\u00fbm&lt;/a&gt; and brother of Sultan &lt;a href=\"Kayqubad%20I\"&gt;Kayqubad I&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ahlatshahs left a large number of historic &lt;a href=\"Headstone\"&gt;tombstones&lt;/a&gt; in and around the city of &lt;a href=\"Ahlat\"&gt;Ahlat&lt;/a&gt;. Local administrators are currently trying to have the tombstones included in &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20List\"&gt;World Heritage List&lt;/a&gt;, where they are currently listed tentatively."
