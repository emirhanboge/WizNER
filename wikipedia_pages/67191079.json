    "text": "The Cathedral Parish of Saint Gregory the Great (), also known as Legazpi Cathedral and locally as Albay Cathedral, is a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Gregory%20the%20Great\"&gt;Saint Gregory the Great&lt;/a&gt; in the Old Albay District of the city of &lt;a href=\"Legazpi%2C%20Albay\"&gt;Legazpi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albay\"&gt;Albay&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Bicol%20region\"&gt;Bicol region&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. It is the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Legazpi\"&gt;Diocese of Legazpi&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, a &lt;a href=\"Historical%20markers%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;historical marker&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Historical%20Commission%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;National Historical Commission of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; was unveiled at the cathedral.\nHistory.\n The &lt;a href=\"Cities%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of Legazpi today was initially a &lt;a href=\"barangay\"&gt;barangay&lt;/a&gt; called \"Sawangan\", which at present corresponds to the location of the Legazpi Port. The mission in the area, the \"Mission de San Gregorio Magno de Sawangan\", was founded by the &lt;a href=\"Franciscan\"&gt;Franciscan&lt;/a&gt;s in 1587 as a \"visita\" of Cagsaua. Its first church of &lt;a href=\"Nypa%20fruticans\"&gt;nipa&lt;/a&gt; and lumber was constructed which was placed under the &lt;a href=\"patronage\"&gt;patronage&lt;/a&gt; of Saint Gregory the Great, the &lt;a href=\"pope\"&gt;pope&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; from 590 to 604 &lt;a href=\"Common%20Era\"&gt;CE&lt;/a&gt;. In 1616, it became a full pledged &lt;a href=\"parish\"&gt;parish&lt;/a&gt; and was called \"Albay\". It was reconstructed with &lt;a href=\"wood%20plank\"&gt;wood plank&lt;/a&gt;s in 1635 which was razed by fire in 1754. The first stone church was built under Fr. Pedro Romero in 1834 which was charred again during the &lt;a href=\"Philippine-American%20War\"&gt;Philippine-American War&lt;/a&gt; in 1900. In 1945, parts of the church were damaged during the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, and was subsequently repaired under Fr. Nicanor Belleza. In 1951, it became the seat and cathedral of the Legazpi Diocese upon its foundation from the territories of &lt;a href=\"Archdiocese%20of%20Caceres\"&gt;Diocese of Nueva Caceres&lt;/a&gt;.."
