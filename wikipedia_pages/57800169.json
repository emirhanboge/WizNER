    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20FA%20WSL\"&gt;2018\u201319 season&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.%20Women\"&gt;Liverpool Football Club Women&lt;/a&gt;'s 30th season of competitive &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and its ninth season in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Women%27s%20Super%20League\"&gt;FA Women's Super League&lt;/a&gt; and at the top level of English women's football, being one of the league's foundation clubs. It is also its first season following a re-brand from its former name \"Liverpool Ladies Football Club\". &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Redfearn\"&gt;Neil Redfearn&lt;/a&gt; replaced Scott Rogers as manager before the preseason. Redfearn joins the club after guiding &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20Rovers%20Belles\"&gt;Doncaster Rovers Belles&lt;/a&gt; to the crown of &lt;a href=\"FA%20WSL%202\"&gt;FA WSL 2&lt;/a&gt; in the previous season. Redfearn resigned after three months and only two matches in charge, ending his tenure with a 5\u20130 loss to &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20W.F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; in the league's opening weekend."
