    "text": "The Copyright and Related Rights Regulations 2003 transpose the &lt;a href=\"Information%20Society%20Directive\"&gt;Information Society Directive&lt;/a&gt; \"(Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society)\", (known popularly at the time as the \"EU copyright directive\"), into &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; law. As such, its main effects are to modify the\n&lt;a href=\"Copyright%2C%20Designs%20and%20Patents%20Act%201988\"&gt;Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988&lt;/a&gt; c.\u00a048 (\"the 1988 Act\") with minor consequential modifications to other\n&lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Acts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"statutory%20Instrument\"&gt;secondary legislation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe regulations modify the concept of broadcast and broadcasting to take account of development in the &lt;a href=\"internet\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;; restrict\nthe acts which are permitted without infringing copyright (in particular acts which could be performed commercially); and\nprovide new measures for the protection and enforcement of copyright and performers' rights.\nOnly two EU Member States met the 22 December 2002 deadline for implement, the UK implemented the directive in 2003 but in November 2004 was convicted for non-implementation of the directive in the territory of &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBroadcasts.\nRegulation\u00a04 provides a new definition of \"broadcast\" in section\u00a06 of the 1988 Act as\nInternet transmissions are excepted from the definition of a broadcast unless they are transmitted simultaneously with a broadcast by other means, simultaneously with a live event or form part of a service in which programmes are transmitted at specific times determined solely by the person providing the service.\nThe new definition covers the old definitions of broadcast and of \"cable programme\" (s.\u00a07 of the 1988 Act). However the\nseparate definition of cable programme is kept as there is a distinction in the dates at which copyright becomes available:\n1995-01-01 for cable programmes as opposed to 1956-06-01 for broadcasts under the previous definition.\nCommunication to the public.\nThe previous \"infringement by broadcasting or inclusion in a cable programme\" (s.\u00a020 of the 1988 Act) is replaced by a\nnew \"infringement by communication to the public\" (reg.\u00a06). This includes both broadcasting (under the new definition)\nand making a work available to the public by electronic transmission. A performer's rights are also infringed if his\nperformance is made available to the public without his consent (reg;\u00a07; new s.\u00a0182CA of the 1988 Act).\nPermitted acts and copyright exceptions.\nNeither copyright (except in a computer program or a database) nor performer's rights are infringed by the\nsimple act of transmitting the work between third parties over a network, even if the process of transmission involves\nmaking temporary copies (reg.\u00a08)\nThe existing &lt;a href=\"fair%20dealing\"&gt;fair dealing&lt;/a&gt; for the purposes of research or private study (s.\u00a029 of the 1988 Act) was limited so that it is only permitted for a non-commercial purpose (reg.\u00a09). A similar restriction was imposed on permitted copying by librarians (ss.\u00a038, 39, 43 of the 1988 Act; reg.\u00a014) or archivists of folksongs (s.\u00a061 of the 1988 Act; reg.\u00a016) for third parties. The observation or study of the functioning of a computer program was removed from the remit of fair dealing (reg.\u00a09) and replaced by a statutory permission to study the functioning of the program while legally performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program (reg.\u00a015; new s.\u00a050BA of the 1988 Act). It was clarified that fair dealing for the purposes of criticism, review or news reporting is only allowed for published works (reg.\u00a010).\nThe permitted use without a licence of copyright material for educational use (ss.\u00a032, 35, 36 of the 1988 Act) was restricted to non-commercial purposes (regs.\u00a011\u201313). Regulation\u00a018 removes the permission to use third parties (e.g. outside DJs) to play sound recordings for the purposes of a non-commercial club or society (s.\u00a067 of the 1988 Act). The exception for public showing or playing of broadcasts of music (s.\u00a072 of the 1988 Act) was also permitted, and the Secretary of State was enabled to propose a licensing scheme covering such public showing or playing, which may be compulsory (reg.\u00a021).\nTechnical measures.\nNew s.\u00a0296 of the 1988 Act created new rights in respect of copyright works to which &lt;a href=\"copy%20protection\"&gt;copy protection&lt;/a&gt; measures have been applied. This right is held concurrently by:\nThe right is infringed:\nThe new section\u00a0296ZB established the criminal offenses of:\nThe new section\u00a0296ZC allows the use of &lt;a href=\"search%20warrant\"&gt;search warrant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Asset%20forfeiture\"&gt;forfeiture&lt;/a&gt; with respect to these offenses. The new section\u00a0296ZE created a remedy via complaint to the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; if a technical device or measure prevents a person or group of people from carrying out a permitted act with relation to the work. The Secretary of State may issue a direction to the owner of the copyright to take such measures as are necessary to enable the permitted act to be carried out. The breach of such a direction is actionable as a &lt;a href=\"breach%20of%20statutory%20duty\"&gt;breach of statutory duty&lt;/a&gt;.\nRights management information.\nNew s.\u00a0296ZG of the 1988 Act created new rights in respect of electronic rights management information &lt;a href=\"metadata\"&gt;metadata&lt;/a&gt;. The right is infringed by:\nEnforcement of copyright and performer's rights.\nThe infringement of copyright or performer's rights by making a work available to the public in the course of a business or to an extent which prejudicially affects the copyright owner becomes a criminal offense (reg.\u00a026; new s.\u00a0107(2A) of the 1988 Act).\nA copyright holder may obtain an &lt;a href=\"injunction\"&gt;injunction&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Scots%20law\"&gt;Scots law&lt;/a&gt;: interdict) against an &lt;a href=\"Internet%20service%20provider\"&gt;Internet service provider&lt;/a&gt; (ISP) who has \"actual knowledge\" of another person using their service to infringe copyright or a performer's right. In determining whether the ISP has actual knowledge of the infringing use, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20of%20Justice\"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Session\"&gt;Court of Session&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland) shall take into account all matters which appear to be relevant, in particular whether the ISP has received notification under regulation\u00a06(1)(c) of the &lt;a href=\"Electronic%20Commerce%20Regulations%202002\"&gt;Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002&lt;/a&gt; No.\u00a02013 (reg.\u00a027; new ss.\u00a097A, 191JA of the 1988 Act).\nRegulation\u00a028 extended the right to bring action for infringement of copyright to non-exclusive licensees (it was previously limited to copyright owners and exclusive licensees) when the infringement is directly connected to a prior licensed act by the licensee and the licence expressly grants a right of action (new s.\u00a0101A of the 1998 Act).\nThe non-exclusive licensee shall have the same rights and remedies as the copyright owner would have in any action.\nThe right of the non-exclusive licensee to bring action is concomitant with that of the copyright owner.\nDuration of protection.\nRegulation\u00a029 amends section\u00a013A of the 1988 Act to take account of the new definition of \"communication to the public\" so that the copyright in sound recordings expires:"
