    "text": "Waldfriedhof Zehlendorf (Zehlendorf forest cemetery) is a cemetery located in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Nikolassee\"&gt;Nikolassee&lt;/a&gt; district. The cemetery occupies an area of 376,975 m2. An additional Italian war cemetery was created there in 1953. A number of notable people of Berlin are buried at the cemetery; some have a \"grave of honor\" (). In particular, all of Berlin's deceased post-war mayors are buried here.\nLandscape and buildings.\nThe northern part of the cemetery was built between 1945 and 1947 by &lt;a href=\"Herta%20Hammerbacher\"&gt;Herta Hammerbacher&lt;/a&gt;, and expanded from 1948 to 1954 by &lt;a href=\"Max%20Dietrich\"&gt;Max Dietrich&lt;/a&gt;. About a third of the area was forest, which was already 50 years old and was intentionally kept. The trees are mostly firs, with a few oaks, mountain-ashes and birches. Two straight paths in north\u2013south direction structure the cemetery, connected by curved paths. The funeral halls are situated on a natural hill. Between the entrance and the halls is a large U-shaped meadow which was originally designed as &lt;a href=\"heath\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt;. The graves are arranged in rows, both in the meadow part as in the forest part.\nA war cemetery was created in 1953 for 1,183 Italian &lt;a href=\"Prisoner%20of%20war\"&gt;POW&lt;/a&gt;s, many of them unidentified, who died or were killed near Berlin. It is lined by trees and bushes and thus separated from the rest of the cemetery. The grave plates are arranged in a regular pattern.\nTwo halls, called \"Feierhallen\" (celebration halls) or \"Kapelle\" (chapel), on a hill were built from 1956 to 1958 by and . A larger and a smaller hall are connected by smaller administrative buildings. In front of the halls, two high walls covered with &lt;a href=\"travertine\"&gt;travertine&lt;/a&gt; symbolize the transition from life to death. The halls are reinforced concrete structures, with fronts of glass open to nature. Architect Ruegenberg, a student of &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Scharoun\"&gt;Hans Scharoun&lt;/a&gt;, built simple rectangular elements on the walls and ceiling, based on a square module, and achieved \"zur\u00fcckhaltende Feierlichkeit\" (reticent solemnity). An entrance gate at the Potsdamer Chaussee was built in 1950 by Friedrich D\u00fcckerstieg, and a gate at Wasgensteig in 1959 by Hans-Joachim Sachse and Bernhard Busen. A bell tower on the meadow was created in 1973 by Ruegenberg and M\u00f6llendorff.\nNotable people.\nMany Berlin celebrities are buried on the Waldfriedhof Zehlendorf. 43 (as of 2002) have an &lt;a href=\"Ehrengrab\"&gt;Ehrengrab&lt;/a&gt;, cared for by the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Senate\"&gt;Berlin Senate&lt;/a&gt; (marked by * in the following list), including &lt;a href=\"Willy%20Brandt\"&gt;Willy Brandt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Governing%20Mayor%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;Mayor of Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Chancellor%20of%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany\"&gt;\"Bundeskanzler\"&lt;/a&gt;, and ballet dancer and choreographer &lt;a href=\"Tatjana%20Gsovsky\"&gt;Tatjana Gsovsky&lt;/a&gt;."
