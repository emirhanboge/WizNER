    "text": "21-87 is a 1963 Canadian &lt;a href=\"abstract%20film\"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"montage%20%28filmmaking%29\"&gt;montage&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"collage%20film\"&gt;collage film&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Lipsett\"&gt;Arthur Lipsett&lt;/a&gt; that lasts 9 minutes and 33 seconds. The &lt;a href=\"short%20film\"&gt;short&lt;/a&gt;, produced by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Film%20Board%20of%20Canada\"&gt;National Film Board of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, is a collage of snippets from discarded footage found by Lipsett in the editing room of the National Film Board (where he was employed as an &lt;a href=\"Animation\"&gt;animator&lt;/a&gt;), combined with his own black and white 16\u00a0mm footage which he shot on the streets of Montreal and New York City, among other locations.\nRelease and reception.\n\"21-87\" premiered on the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt; program \"Explorations\" in 1964.\nJournalist &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Junker\"&gt;Howard Junker&lt;/a&gt; dismisses \"21-87\" and Lipsett's other film, \"Free Fall\", as repetitious: \"the whole idea of wildly flashing stills and phrases wears quickly\". Critic N. Roy Clifton is frustrated by the seeming randomness of the images. Critic John Fell suggests the film is evocative of &lt;a href=\"parataxis\"&gt;parataxis&lt;/a&gt;, like a sentence without a &lt;a href=\"Conjunction%20%28grammar%29\"&gt;conjunctive&lt;/a&gt; word.\nInfluence on George Lucas.\n\"21-87\" would have a profound influence on director &lt;a href=\"George%20Lucas\"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Murch\"&gt;Walter Murch&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Sound%20editor%20%28filmmaking%29\"&gt;editor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sound%20designer\"&gt;designer&lt;/a&gt; with whom Lucas worked. Lucas described it as \"the kind of movie I wanted to make \u2014 a very off the wall, abstract kind of film\".\nIn response, Lucas created the &lt;a href=\"pure%20cinema\"&gt;pure cinema&lt;/a&gt;, short, 16mm movies: \"&lt;a href=\"6-18-67\"&gt;6-18-67&lt;/a&gt;\", \"\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Look%20at%20Life%20%28film%29\"&gt;Look at Life&lt;/a&gt;\". The later \"\", an experimental &lt;a href=\"science%20fiction\"&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt; short, takes place in a &lt;a href=\"dystopia\"&gt;dystopia&lt;/a&gt;n future on May 14, 2187. Lucas expanded the latter into \"&lt;a href=\"THX%201138\"&gt;THX 1138&lt;/a&gt;\". His later works \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Graffiti\"&gt;American Graffiti&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Star%20Wars%20%28film%29\"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;\" has shown \"21-87\"'s influence. Lucas and Lipsett would never meet.\nThe concept of &lt;a href=\"the%20Force\"&gt;the Force&lt;/a&gt;, so prominent in \"Star Wars\" and its sequels and prequels, is said to have been inspired by a statement made by &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Kroitor\"&gt;Roman Kroitor&lt;/a&gt; in the short film."
