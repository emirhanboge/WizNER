    "text": "Lake Iznik () is a &lt;a href=\"lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bursa%20Province\"&gt;Province of Bursa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. It is around 32\u00a0km in length and 10\u00a0km in width with a maximum depth of about 80\u00a0m. The town of &lt;a href=\"Iznik\"&gt;Iznik&lt;/a&gt; (historically known as &lt;a href=\"Nicaea\"&gt;Nicaea&lt;/a&gt;) lies at its eastern end. The lake's &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; name was (); the &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; name was Ascania.\nHistory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Greek%20mythology\"&gt;Greek mythology&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Trojan%20War\"&gt;Trojan War&lt;/a&gt; the region by the Lake \u0130znik was held by the &lt;a href=\"Phrygians\"&gt;Phrygians&lt;/a&gt;, who sent troops to the aid of King &lt;a href=\"Priam\"&gt;Priam&lt;/a&gt;, led by the brothers &lt;a href=\"Phorcys%20%28Trojan%20War%29\"&gt;Phorcys&lt;/a&gt; and Ascanius, sons of &lt;a href=\"Aretaon\"&gt;Aretaon&lt;/a&gt; as related in the \"&lt;a href=\"Iliad\"&gt;Iliad&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAscanius, son of Aretaon, should not be confused with &lt;a href=\"Ascanius\"&gt;Ascanius&lt;/a&gt; (son of &lt;a href=\"Aeneas\"&gt;Aeneas&lt;/a&gt;) or Ascanius (son of Priam), who also feature in legends of the Trojan War.\nIn the 1920s, the region was known for &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt; production.\nIn 2014, during &lt;a href=\"aerial%20photography\"&gt;aerial photography&lt;/a&gt; to survey the local monuments, &lt;a href=\"Basilica%20of%20Saint%20Neophytos\"&gt;the remains&lt;/a&gt; of an underwater &lt;a href=\"Byzantine\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"basilica\"&gt;basilica&lt;/a&gt; -possibly erected in the 4th century- were identified, a discovery which was named one of the top 10 discoveries by the &lt;a href=\"Archeological%20Institute%20of%20America\"&gt;Archeological Institute of America&lt;/a&gt;. The basilica was dedicated to &lt;a href=\"St.%20Neophytos%20of%20Nicaea\"&gt;St. Neophytos of Nicaea&lt;/a&gt; and it is thought that the effects of an earthquake which took place in A.D. 740 provoked its collapse. Plans are on the way to establish an underwater museum.\nImportant Bird Area.\nThe lake, which is in unprotected status, was declared by &lt;a href=\"BirdLife%20International\"&gt;BirdLife International&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"Important%20Bird%20Area\"&gt;Important Bird Area&lt;/a&gt; in 1989 for its &lt;a href=\"waterfowl\"&gt;waterfowl&lt;/a&gt; species, which are threatened through pollution and development of \u0130znik as a recreational center."
