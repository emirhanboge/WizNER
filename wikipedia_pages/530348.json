    "text": "East Azerbaijan Province ( \"\u0100zarb\u0101ij\u0101n-e Sharqi\"; ) is one of the 31 &lt;a href=\"provinces%20of%20Iran\"&gt;provinces of Iran&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan%20%28Iran%29\"&gt;Iranian Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, bordering with &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Republic of Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ardabil%20Province\"&gt;Ardabil Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Azerbaijan%20Province\"&gt;West Azerbaijan Province&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zanjan%20Province\"&gt;Zanjan Province&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of East Azerbaijan is &lt;a href=\"Tabriz\"&gt;Tabriz&lt;/a&gt;. East Azerbaijan Province is in &lt;a href=\"Regions%20of%20Iran\"&gt;Regions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Region%203%2C%20Iran\"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; of Iran, with its secretariat located in its capital city, &lt;a href=\"Tabriz\"&gt;Tabriz&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe province covers an area of approximately 47,830\u00a0km\u00b2, it has a population of around four million people. The province has common borders with the Republic of Azerbaijan, Armenia and &lt;a href=\"Nakhchivan%20Autonomous%20Republic\"&gt;Autonomous Nakhchivan&lt;/a&gt; in the north, &lt;a href=\"West%20Azerbaijan\"&gt;West Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; in the west, &lt;a href=\"Zanjan%20Province\"&gt;Zanjan&lt;/a&gt; in the south, and &lt;a href=\"Ardabil%20Province\"&gt;Ardabil&lt;/a&gt; in the east. A fine network of roads and railways connects East Azerbaijan to other parts of &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and neighboring countries.\nThe highest point in East Azerbaijan is the volcanic peak of Sahand Mountain at of elevation, lying south of &lt;a href=\"Tabriz\"&gt;Tabriz&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the lower-lying areas are around Garmadooz (Ahar). The hills and mountains of the province are divided into three ranges: the &lt;a href=\"Qara%20Daq%2C%20East%20Azarbaijan\"&gt;Qara Daq Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the Sahand and Bozqoosh Mountains, and the Qaflan Kooh Mountains.\nThe climate of East Azerbaijan is affected by Mediterranean Continental as well as the cold semi-arid climate. Gentle breezes off the &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20Sea\"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt; have some influence on the climate of the low-lying areas. Temperatures run up to 8.9\u00a0\u00b0C in Tabriz, and 20\u00a0\u00b0C in Maraqeh, in the winter dropping to \u221210\u2013\u221215\u00a0\u00b0C at least (depending on how cold the overall year is). The ideal seasons to visit this province are in the spring and summer months.\nHistory.\nEast Azerbaijan is one of the most archaic territories in &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. During the reign of &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20III%20of%20Macedon\"&gt;Alexander of Macedon&lt;/a&gt; in Iran (331 BCE), a warrior known as Attorpat led a revolt in this area, then a territory of the &lt;a href=\"Medes\"&gt;Medes&lt;/a&gt;, and thereafter it was called \"Attorpatkan\". Since then this vicinity has been known as \"Azarabadegan\", \"Azarbadgan\" and \"Azarbayjan\".\nIslamic researchers proclaim that the birth of the prophet &lt;a href=\"Zoroaster\"&gt;Zoroaster&lt;/a&gt; was in this area, in the vicinity of Lake Orumieh (\"Chichesht\"), Konzak City. Needless to say, this province was subject to numerous political and economical upheavals, attracting the interest of foreigners. The Russians in particular have tried to exert a lasting influence in the region over the past 300 years, occupying the area on numerous occasions. The &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20Revolution%20of%20Iran\"&gt;constitutionalist&lt;/a&gt; movement of Iran began here in the late 19th century.\nEthnic tensions in Azerbaijan can &lt;a href=\"Nagorno-Karabakh%20conflict\"&gt;legally&lt;/a&gt; trace their origins back to the colonialist policies of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russia\"&gt;Imperial Russia&lt;/a&gt; and later the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. In a cable sent on 6 July 1945 by the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, the local Soviet commander in Russian (northern) held Azerbaijan was instructed as such:\nIn 1945, the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; helped set up the &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan%20People%27s%20Government\"&gt;Azerbaijan People's Government&lt;/a&gt; in what is now East Azerbaijan.\nAdministrative divisions.\nAt the 1986 census there were twelve counties in East Azerbaijan Province. By the 1996 census two additional counties had been formed, &lt;a href=\"Jolfa%20County\"&gt;Jolfa&lt;/a&gt; from part of &lt;a href=\"Marand%20County\"&gt;Marand&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malekan%20County\"&gt;Malekan&lt;/a&gt; from part of &lt;a href=\"Bonab%20County\"&gt;Bonab&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1996 and 2002, five new counties were formed: &lt;a href=\"Ajab%20Shir%20County\"&gt;Ajabshir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azarshahr%20County\"&gt;Azarshahr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charuymaq%20County\"&gt;Charoimaq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osku%20County\"&gt;Osku&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varzaqan%20County\"&gt;Varzaqan&lt;/a&gt;. In 2010 &lt;a href=\"Kalibar%20County\"&gt;Kalibar&lt;/a&gt; was split in half with the northern part becoming &lt;a href=\"Khoda%20Afarin%20County\"&gt;Khoda Afarin&lt;/a&gt;, while the southern part kept the name Kalibar.\nCounties as of 2012.\n&lt;a href=\"Osku%20County\"&gt;Osku County&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Malekan%20County\"&gt;Malekan County&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Azarshahr%20County\"&gt;Azarshahr County&lt;/a&gt;\nCulture.\nFrom a cultural point of view, the most outstanding features are the language, &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijani%20language\"&gt;Azari/Azerice&lt;/a&gt;, and folklore of this region. According to &lt;a href=\"Dehkhoda%20Dictionary\"&gt;Dehkhoda Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, the language of Azerbaijan is originally \"a branch of the Iranian languages known as Azari\" (\"see &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Azari%20language\"&gt;Ancient Azari language&lt;/a&gt;\"). However, the modern Azeri language is a Turkic language very closely related to the language of &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Republic of Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; and Turkey. Apart from this, the province also boasts numerous learned scholars, gnostics, several national poets such as \"Mowlana Baba Mazeed\", \"Khajeh Abdol Raheem Aj Abadi\", \"Sheikh Hassan Bolqari\", and \"Abdolqader Nakhjavani\", to name a few, and the contemporary poet \"Ostad Mohammad Hossein Shahriyar\". The current &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Leader\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; of Iran, &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Khamenei\"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;, also originally comes from this region.\n&lt;a href=\"Iran%27s%20Cultural%20Heritage%20Organization\"&gt;Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization&lt;/a&gt; has registered 936 sites of historical significance in the province. Some are contemporary, and some are from the antiquity of ancient Persia. \"&lt;a href=\"Zahak\"&gt;Zahak&lt;/a&gt; Citadel\", for example, is the name of an ancient ruin in East Azerbaijan, which according to various experts, was inhabited from the second millennium BC until the Timurid era. First excavated in the 1800s by British archeologists, &lt;a href=\"Iran%27s%20Cultural%20Heritage%20Organization\"&gt;Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization&lt;/a&gt; has been studying the structure in 6 phases.&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20061001142816/http%3A//www.chn.ir/news/%3Fsection%3D2%26amp%3Bid%3D31507\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nEast Azerbaijan enjoys a rich compendium of Azeri traditions. Many local dances and folk songs continue to survive among the various peoples of the province. As a longstanding province of &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, Azerbaijan is mentioned favorably on many occasions in &lt;a href=\"Persian%20literature\"&gt;Persian literature&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Persian%20poets%20and%20authors\"&gt;Iran's greatest authors and poets&lt;/a&gt;.\nEast Azerbaijan today.\nEast Azerbaijan province is an industrial centre of &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. East Azerbaijan province has over 5000 manufacturing units (6% percent of national total). The value of product from these units in 1997 was US$374 million (373 billion rials = 4.07% of the national total). Total investments were valued at US$2.7 billion (2.4513 trillion rials) in 1997.\nSome of the major industries in East Azerbaijan are glass industries, paper manufacturing, steel, copper and nepheline syenite, oil refinery, petrochemical processing facilities, chemical products, pharmaceutical processing, foundries, vehicle and auto-parts industries, industrial machines, agricultural machines, food industries, leather, and shoe industries.\nEast Azerbaijan has an excellent position in the handicraft industry of Iran, which has a large share in the exports of the province. Tabriz carpets are widely known around the world and in international markets for their vibrant designs and colors. At present there are about 66,000 carpet production units in the province, employing some 200,000 people. The annual production of these carpets is roughly 792,000 m\u00b2, which comprises more than 70% of Iran's carpet exports. 35% of all Iranian carpets are produced in East Azerbaijan. East Azerbaijan province is also one of the richest regions of Iran in natural minerals, with 180 mines in 1997, of which 121 units are currently in operation, and the rest are being planned.\n&lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; has two Biosphere reserves in East Azerbaijan province. One in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Urmia\"&gt;Lake Urmia&lt;/a&gt; and the other at &lt;a href=\"Arasbaran\"&gt;Arasbaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nColleges and universities.\nEast Azerbaijan also has some of Iran's prestigious universities including:"
