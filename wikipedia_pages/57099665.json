    "text": "Christopher (Chris) Ferris (born c. 1957) is a &lt;a href=\"computer%20scientist\"&gt;computer scientist&lt;/a&gt;, best known for co-leading the &lt;a href=\"Hyperledger\"&gt;Hyperledger&lt;/a&gt; Fabric project where he chaired the Technical Steering Committee from 2016 to 2018 and was a member of the Governing Board of the foremost &lt;a href=\"blockchain\"&gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt; project of the &lt;a href=\"Linux%20Foundation\"&gt;Linux Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hyperledger\"&gt;Hyperledger&lt;/a&gt; has been one of the fastest growing open community projects, with over 200 corporate and associate members. Ferris has a history of &lt;a href=\"open-source%20software\"&gt;open-source software&lt;/a&gt; contributions to other technologies, including &lt;a href=\"web%20services\"&gt;web services&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cloud\"&gt;cloud&lt;/a&gt;. Ferris is currently an IBM Fellow, and CTO Open Technologies.\nHistory.\nIn 1999, Ferris was invited to work with &lt;a href=\"OASIS%20%28organization%29\"&gt;OASIS (organization)&lt;/a&gt; on the problem of B2B transactions, launching his open source career development. In the early days of the &lt;a href=\"internet\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;, vendor-specific and proprietary &lt;a href=\"Electronic%20Data%20Interchange\"&gt;Electronic Data Interchange&lt;/a&gt; or EDI systems were proving \u201cclunky\u201d (slow to deploy and hard to maintain), and needed to be revised and opened up to encourage much faster adoption rates. As a Chief Architect of &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Microsystems\"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt; IT, he was invited to the first and second meetings of the &lt;a href=\"OASIS%20%28organization%29\"&gt;OASIS (organization)&lt;/a&gt; working group looking into &lt;a href=\"ebXML\"&gt;ebXML&lt;/a&gt; (Electronic Business Markup Language) for &lt;a href=\"Enterprise%20resource%20planning\"&gt;ERP&lt;/a&gt; (Enterprise Resource Management) and &lt;a href=\"Business-to-business\"&gt;B2B&lt;/a&gt; (Business to Business) transactions, such as invoices, purchasing, payment transactions. The &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; adopted this work as the foundational international standard around global commerce, see &lt;a href=\"UN/CEFACT\"&gt;UN/CEFACT&lt;/a&gt;.\nFerris became vice chair of the OASIS working group on &lt;a href=\"messaging\"&gt;messaging&lt;/a&gt;. This work lead to &lt;a href=\"SOAP\"&gt;SOAP&lt;/a&gt; replacing or underlying vendor-specific proprietary messaging systems, and led to the development of &lt;a href=\"XML\"&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; (eXtensible Markup Language) developed by a working group at the &lt;a href=\"W3C\"&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt; (World Wide Web Consortium). Ferris then became chair of &lt;a href=\"web%20service\"&gt;web service&lt;/a&gt; architecture working group at the W3C. In fall 2002, Ferris joined IBM, and later became an IBM Distinguished Engineer.\nFerris has also provided technical oversight and leadership in OpenStack, Cloud Foundry, Cloud Native Compute Foundation, Open Container Initiative, Mesos, Docker.,\nLinux Foundation Hyperledger.\nFerris was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Hyperledger\"&gt;Hyperledger&lt;/a&gt; Technical Steering Committee. He is an advocate for open source code communities with commercially-friendly licenses, and open governance, such as &lt;a href=\"Linux%20Foundation\"&gt;Linux Foundation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hyperledger\"&gt;Hyperledger&lt;/a&gt;.\nFerris was the keynote speaker on the \"State of Blockchain\", at the 2017 Open Source Leadership Summit for the &lt;a href=\"Linux%20Foundation\"&gt;Linux Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatents.\nPatents that are cited more than one hundred times:"
