    "text": "Sam Hoare (born 1985), is the Australian for &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Halifax%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;. Sam paid his air fare over to the UK in hope that he would get a contract with a club. After being turned away by rivals &lt;a href=\"Castleford%20Tigers\"&gt;Castleford Tigers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halifax%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Hall%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Martin Hall&lt;/a&gt; gave Hoare a trial originally till the end of March 2007. But after two impressive appearances including two tries in his d\u00e9but against &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20Thunder\"&gt;Gateshead Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, Hall was quick to obtain Sam's signature, in which Sam signed a one-year deal. Sam was formerly with &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;NSWRL&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Western%20Suburbs%20Magpies\"&gt;Western Suburbs Magpies&lt;/a&gt;."
