    "text": "Hatam\u2013Mansim is a small language family of New Guinea, consisting of two languages:\nRoss (2005) tentatively classified Hatam as a branch of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Papuan%20languages\"&gt;West Papuan&lt;/a&gt; family, based on similarities in pronouns (he did not consider Mansim), but \"Glottolog\" continues to list Hatam\u2013Mansim as an independent family. Following Reesink (2002), \"Glottolog\" lists Mansim as a language distinct from Hattam: \"comparisons of old wordlists (e.g. von der Gabelentz &amp; Meyer 1882) readily confirm this difference.\""
