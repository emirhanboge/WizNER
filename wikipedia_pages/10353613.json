    "text": "Sherald Fergus Brownrigg (September 30, 1937 \u2013 September 20, 1996) was an American film director and producer.\nBiography.\nSherald Fergus Brownrigg was born September 30, 1937 in &lt;a href=\"El%20Dorado%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;El Dorado, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 1970s he directed several low budget &lt;a href=\"horror%20film\"&gt;horror film&lt;/a&gt;s, such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20%281973%20film%29\"&gt;Don't Look in the Basement&lt;/a&gt;\" (1973), \"&lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Open%20the%20Door%21\"&gt;Don't Open the Door!&lt;/a&gt;\" (1974), and \"&lt;a href=\"Scum%20of%20the%20Earth%20%281974%20film%29\"&gt;Poor White Trash Part II&lt;/a&gt;\" (1974). \nIn 2001, a reviewer for the \"&lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Daily\"&gt;Michigan Daily&lt;/a&gt;\" called \"Poor White Trash Part II\" \"the worst movie of all time.\" Other commentators value Brownrigg's work for his ability to create thrills with a minuscule budget."
