    "text": "Cho Man-sik (, pen-name Kodang; 1 February 1883 \u2013 October? 1950) was a &lt;a href=\"Korean%20nationalism\"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; activist in &lt;a href=\"Korean%20independence%20movement\"&gt;Korea's independence movement&lt;/a&gt;. He became involved in the power struggle that enveloped &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; in the months following the &lt;a href=\"Surrender%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese surrender&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, Cho was supported by the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; for the eventual rule of North Korea. However, due to his opposition to &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Trusteeship%20Council\"&gt;trusteeship&lt;/a&gt;, Cho lost Soviet support and was forced from power by the &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20Party%20of%20North%20Korea\"&gt;Soviet-backed and pro Soviet communists in the north&lt;/a&gt; (a predecessor of &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;WPK&lt;/a&gt; ). Placed under &lt;a href=\"house%20arrest\"&gt;house arrest&lt;/a&gt; in January 1946, he later &lt;a href=\"Forced%20disappearance\"&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt;, and is generally believed to have been executed in the &lt;a href=\"Prisons%20in%20North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korean prison system&lt;/a&gt; soon after the start of the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;. \nCho Man-sik, &lt;a href=\"Gye-Jun%20Ryu\"&gt;Gye-Jun Ryu&lt;/a&gt;, Kim Dong-won, and Oh Yun-seon are cited as the pillars of the Sanjunghyun Church in &lt;a href=\"Pyongyang\"&gt;Pyongyang&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nCho was born in &lt;a href=\"Kangs%C5%8F-gun\"&gt;Kangs\u014f-gun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Pyongan\"&gt;South P'y\u014fngan&lt;/a&gt; Province, now in &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; on 1 February 1883. He was raised and educated in a traditional &lt;a href=\"Confucianism\"&gt;Confucian&lt;/a&gt; style but later converted to &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestantism&lt;/a&gt; and became an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;elder&lt;/a&gt;. From June 1908 to 1913 Cho moved to Japan to study &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; in Tokyo at &lt;a href=\"Meiji%20University\"&gt;Meiji University&lt;/a&gt;. It was during his stay in Tokyo that Cho came into contact with &lt;a href=\"Mohandas%20Karamchand%20Gandhi\"&gt;Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s ideas of non-violence and self-sufficiency. Cho later used these ideas of &lt;a href=\"Nonviolence\"&gt;non-violent&lt;/a&gt; opposition to resist &lt;a href=\"Korea%20under%20Japanese%20rule\"&gt;Japanese rule&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndependence movement.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Korea%20under%20Japanese%20rule\"&gt;Japan's annexation of Korea&lt;/a&gt; in 1910 Cho became increasingly involved with his country's &lt;a href=\"Korean%20independence%20movement\"&gt;independence movement&lt;/a&gt;. His participation in the &lt;a href=\"March%201st%20Movement\"&gt;March 1st Movement&lt;/a&gt; led to his arrest and detention, along with tens of thousands of other Koreans. He is also famous for publicly rejecting the Japanese Imperial government's policy of pressuring Koreans to &lt;a href=\"S%C5%8Dshi-kaimei\"&gt;legally change their surnames&lt;/a&gt; into Japanese. In 1922 Cho established the Korean Products Promotion Society with the objective of achieving economic self-sufficiency and that Koreans could obtain solely home-produced products. Cho intended the Society to be a national movement supported by all religious organizations and social groups, particularly ordinary Koreans.\nDue to the Korean Products Promotion Society, his strong non-violent resistance, and leading by example rather than political or social authority, Cho gained respect even from critics, and earned him the title \u201cGandhi of Korea\u201d. Despite this record, his encouragement of Korean student enlistment in the Japanese army earned him a mixed reputation with some of his fellow nationalists.\nPost World War II activism.\nIn August 1945, with Japanese surrender imminent, Cho was approached by the Japanese governor of &lt;a href=\"Pyongyang\"&gt;Pyongyang&lt;/a&gt; and asked to organise a committee to assume control and maintain stability in the power vacuum that would inevitably follow. He agreed to co-operate, and on 17 August 1945 formed the Provisional People's Committee for the Five &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Provinces&lt;/a&gt;. The committee functioned to standardize the number of members, duties, and electoral processes for the formation of People\u2019s Committees at the provincial, city, country, township, and village levels. Cho also affiliated this committee to the &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20Korea%23North%20Korea\"&gt;Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence&lt;/a&gt; (CPKI). The Provisional People\u2019s Committee for the Five Provinces generally composed of &lt;a href=\"Right-wing%20politics\"&gt;right-wing&lt;/a&gt; nationalists opposed to &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communism&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20forces\"&gt;Soviet forces&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Pyongyang following the &lt;a href=\"surrender%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese surrender&lt;/a&gt; they hoped they could influence Cho Man-sik. Cho was at this time the most popular leader in Pyongyang due mainly to his constant resistance to the Japanese and his formation of the Korean Products Promotions Society. Soviet officers regularly met with Cho and tried to convince him to head the emerging North Korea administration. Cho however disliked communism and did not trust foreign powers. Cho Man-sik would have agreed to co-operate with the Soviet authorities only on his own terms, such as extensive autonomy. Cho's conditions were not accepted by the Soviet leaders and supervisors. Despite his rejection of Soviet requests he was able to remain as chairman of the South P\u2019y\u014fngan People\u2019s Committee.\nOn 3 November 1945, Cho also established his own political party: &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Social%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;The Democratic Party of Korea&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning it was intended to turn into an authentic political organization of the nationalist right with the aim to bring about a democratic society after &lt;a href=\"Korea%20under%20Japanese%20rule\"&gt;Japanese occupation&lt;/a&gt;. The Soviets, however, did not approve of the Democratic Party of Korea and thus under socialist pressure, &lt;a href=\"Choe%20Yong-gon%20%28army%20commander%29\"&gt;Choi Yong-kun&lt;/a&gt; was elected the first deputy chairman of the party. Choi Yong-kun was a &lt;a href=\"Guerrilla%20warfare\"&gt;guerrilla soldier&lt;/a&gt; who served in the &lt;a href=\"88th%20Separate%20Rifle%20Brigade\"&gt;88th brigade&lt;/a&gt; of the Soviet Union, and was a friend of &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung\"&gt;Kim Il-sung&lt;/a&gt;. The party was therefore influenced by Soviet ideals from the beginning.\nSoviet faith that Cho Man-sik could become a North Korean leader with Soviet ideals diminished and new hope was placed on the Korean communist and pre-Soviet officer &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung\"&gt;Kim Il-sung&lt;/a&gt;. Kim Il-sung had trained in the Soviet and Chinese Communist Army (latter is &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Anti-Japanese%20United%20Army\"&gt;Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army&lt;/a&gt;, a predecessor of today &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Liberation%20Army\"&gt;PLA&lt;/a&gt;) for ten years, rising to the rank of major. Under Soviet pressure, Cho was obliged to reorganize the Provisional People's Committee for the Five Provinces, and accept more communists onto the councils. The opposing ideologies of Kim and Cho led to a clash between the two men, and the forced power-sharing failed to sit well with either of them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Conference%20%281945%29\"&gt;1945 Moscow Conference&lt;/a&gt; between the victorious &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allies&lt;/a&gt; discussed the statehood of Korea, proposing a four-power &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Trusteeship%20Council\"&gt;trusteeship&lt;/a&gt; for a period of five years, after which Korea would become an independent state. For Cho, this would result in excessive foreign, and particularly communist, influence over his country, and he refused to co-operate. On 1 January 1946, &lt;a href=\"Andrey%20Alekseyevich%20Romanenko\"&gt;Andrey Alekseyevich Romanenko&lt;/a&gt;, a Soviet leader, met with Cho and tried to persuade him to sign support of the trusteeship. Cho however, refused to sign support. After Soviet leaders realized that they could not persuade Cho to endorse Soviet trusteeship, they lost all remaining hope of Cho becoming a prominent North Korean leader reflecting Soviet ideals. On 5 January, Cho was arrested by Soviet soldiers and detained in &lt;a href=\"Pyongyang\"&gt;Pyongyang&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Koryo%20Hotel\"&gt;Koryo Hotel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor some time he was kept under comfortable conditions at the Koryo Hotel, from which position he continued to vocally oppose the communists. He stood in the 1948 vice-presidency election, but by then the Communist influence in the country's affairs was too strong, and he was unsuccessful, receiving only 10 votes from the National Assembly. Cho was later transferred to a prison in Pyongyang, where confirmed reports of him end. In June 1950, days before the start of the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;, the Northern and Southern governments reached a tentative agreement to exchange Cho and his son for jailed South Korean Worker's Party leaders Kim Sam-yong and Yu Ju-ha. However, by June 24th the two sides could not agree on a modality of exchange. After the start of the war the next day, Kim and Yu were executed at &lt;a href=\"Namsan%20%28Seoul%29\"&gt;Namsan&lt;/a&gt; in Seoul. Cho is generally believed to have been executed along with other political prisoners during the early days of the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;, possibly in October 1950. Cho's removal opened the way for &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung\"&gt;Kim Il-sung&lt;/a&gt; to consolidate his power in the north, a position he was able to hold for 48 years until his death in 1994.\nLegacy.\nIn 1970, Cho's deeds gained posthumous recognition when &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n government awarded him the Order of the Republic of Korea in the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Merit%20for%20National%20Foundation\"&gt;Order of Merit for National Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"taekwondo\"&gt;taekwondo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hyeong\"&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hyeong%23Official%20ITF%20Syllabus\"&gt;\"Ko-Dang\"&lt;/a&gt; was named in honour of Cho Man-sik."
