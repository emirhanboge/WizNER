    "text": "The 2010 &lt;a href=\"Lethbridge\"&gt;Lethbridge&lt;/a&gt; municipal election was held Monday, October 18, &lt;a href=\"2010%20in%20Canada\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; to elect a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Lethbridge\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; and eight &lt;a href=\"aldermen\"&gt;aldermen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"at-large\"&gt;at-large&lt;/a&gt;), and five of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Spirit%20Roman%20Catholic%20Separate%20Regional%20Division%20No.%204\"&gt;Holy Spirit Roman Catholic Separate Regional Division No. 4&lt;/a&gt;'s nine &lt;a href=\"trustee\"&gt;trustee&lt;/a&gt;s (as Ward 2). The seven &lt;a href=\"Lethbridge%20School%20District%20No.%2051\"&gt;Lethbridge School District No. 51&lt;/a&gt; trustees were &lt;a href=\"Acclamation\"&gt;acclaimed&lt;/a&gt;, five being &lt;a href=\"incumbent\"&gt;incumbent&lt;/a&gt;s. Since 1968, provincial legislation has required &lt;a href=\"2010%20Alberta%20municipal%20elections\"&gt;every municipality&lt;/a&gt; to hold triennial elections. Of the 69,863 eligible voters, only 24,522 turned in a ballot, a &lt;a href=\"voter%20turnout\"&gt;voter turnout&lt;/a&gt; of 35.1%, and an average of 5.9 aldermen per ballot. One seat was not filled at the swearing-in ceremony, as a result of Alderman-elect Bob Babki's death. The seat was filled following a &lt;a href=\"by-election\"&gt;by-election&lt;/a&gt; over three months later.\nResults.\nBold indicates elected, \"incumbents\" are \"italicized\", and an asterisk indicates not sworn in.\nBy-election.\nThe 2011 Lethbridge municipal by-election was held Tuesday, February 1, &lt;a href=\"2011%20in%20Canada\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; to elect one aldermen &lt;a href=\"at-large\"&gt;at-large&lt;/a&gt;. On October 18, 2010, Bob Babki was elected to the eight alderman &lt;a href=\"Lethbridge%20City%20Council\"&gt;council&lt;/a&gt;, in the regular scheduled municipal election. He died on October 30, from a suspected heart failure, two days before he would have been &lt;a href=\"Oath\"&gt;sworn into&lt;/a&gt; office. Minister of &lt;a href=\"Alberta%20Municipal%20Affairs\"&gt;Municipal Affairs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hector%20Goudreau\"&gt;Hector Goudreau&lt;/a&gt; wrote Mayor &lt;a href=\"Rajko%20Dodic\"&gt;Rajko Dodic&lt;/a&gt;, and by extension all citizens of &lt;a href=\"Lethbridge\"&gt;Lethbridge&lt;/a&gt;, on November 18, that because Alderman-elect Babki was declared elected, a &lt;a href=\"by-election\"&gt;by-election&lt;/a&gt; would be required. The Municipal Government Act requires the City to hold a by-election within 90 days of a vacancy, since the vacancy did not occur until the new council was sworn in on November 1, 2010, it would have been January 30, 2011 at the latest, the two day discrepancy was not explained on the City election website. Of the 68,294 eligible voters, only 8,843 turned in a ballot, a &lt;a href=\"voter%20turnout\"&gt;voter turnout&lt;/a&gt; of 12.9%."
