Leaving the 2/2nd on coastal defence, it then fought at &lt;a href=\"Gallipoli%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt; from April to December 1915, under the command of &lt;a href=\"William%20Peyton\"&gt;Major General William Peyton&lt;/a&gt;, before being disbanded in January 1916.\nA different 2nd Mounted Division, was formed in Egypt in 1918 from the Indian elements of the 5th Cavalry Division in France, but then renumbered as the &lt;a href=\"5th%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28British%20Indian%20Army%29\"&gt;5th Cavalry Division&lt;/a&gt;, served in &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; and was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20Occupation%20Force\"&gt;Palestine Occupation Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nA decision was made to form a new mounted division from the mounted brigades in and around the &lt;a href=\"Churn%20railway%20station\"&gt;Churn&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Berkshire\"&gt;Berkshire&lt;/a&gt;. On 2 September 1914, 2nd Mounted Division, with &lt;a href=\"Headquarters%23Military\"&gt;Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Goring-on-Thames\"&gt;Goring&lt;/a&gt;, came into being with three mounted brigades transferred from &lt;a href=\"1st%20Mounted%20Division\"&gt;1st Mounted Division&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"1st%20South%20Midland%20Mounted%20Brigade\"&gt;1st South Midland Mounted Brigade&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Newbury%2C%20Berkshire\"&gt;Newbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2nd%20South%20Midland%20Mounted%20Brigade\"&gt;2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade&lt;/a&gt; at Churn and the &lt;a href=\"Nottinghamshire%20and%20Derbyshire%20Mounted%20Brigade\"&gt;Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"South%20Stoke%2C%20Oxfordshire\"&gt;South Stoke&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"London%20Mounted%20Brigade\"&gt;London Mounted Brigade&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Streatley%2C%20Berkshire\"&gt;Streatley&lt;/a&gt;. The brigades were relatively widely dispersed to allow an adequate water supply for the horses and to provide sufficient training areas.\nIn November 1914, the division moved to &lt;a href=\"Norfolk\"&gt;Norfolk&lt;/a&gt; on coastal defence duties. Headquarters was established at &lt;a href=\"Hanworth%2C%20Norfolk\"&gt;Hanworth&lt;/a&gt; and the mounted brigades were at &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Lynn\"&gt;King's Lynn&lt;/a&gt; (1st South Midland), &lt;a href=\"Fakenham\"&gt;Fakenham&lt;/a&gt; (2nd South Midland), &lt;a href=\"Holt%2C%20Norfolk\"&gt;Holt&lt;/a&gt; (Notts. and Derby.) and Hanworth (London).\nEgypt.\nIn March 1915, the division was put on warning for overseas service.

The mounted brigades were numbered at this time.\nOn 10 August 1915, the division was reorganized as a dismounted formation in preparation for service at &lt;a href=\"Gallipoli%20Campaign\"&gt;Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt;. Each &lt;a href=\"Yeomanry\"&gt;Yeomanry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Regiment\"&gt;Regiment&lt;/a&gt; left a &lt;a href=\"Squadron%20%28army%29\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; headquarters and two &lt;a href=\"troop\"&gt;troop&lt;/a&gt;s (about 100 officers and men) in Egypt to look after the horses. The artillery batteries and ammunition columns, signal troops, mobile veterinary sections, Mounted Brigade Transport and Supply Columns and two of the Field Ambulances were also left behind in Egypt. The &lt;a href=\"Yeomanry%20Mounted%20Brigade\"&gt;Yeomanry Mounted Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, which was formed in Egypt in January 1915, was likewise dismounted and joined the division on 13 August as a fifth brigade. The division entrained for Alexandria on 13 August, sailed the next day and reached &lt;a href=\"Mudros\"&gt;Mudros&lt;/a&gt; on 17 August.

On 21 August it advanced to Chocolate Hill under heavy fire and took part in the attack on Hill 112.\nDue to losses during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Scimitar%20Hill\"&gt;Battle of Scimitar Hill&lt;/a&gt; and wastage during August 1915, the division had to be reorganised. On 4 September 1915, the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Composite%20Mounted%20Brigade\"&gt;1st Composite Mounted Brigade&lt;/a&gt; was formed from the 1st, 2nd and 5th Mounted Brigades, and the &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Composite%20Mounted%20Brigade\"&gt;2nd Composite Mounted Brigade&lt;/a&gt; from the 3rd and 4th Mounted Brigades. Each dismounted brigade formed a battalion sized unit, for example, 1st South Midland Regiment (&lt;a href=\"Warwickshire%20Yeomanry\"&gt;Warkwickshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Gloucestershire%20Hussars\"&gt;Gloucestershire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Own%20Worcestershire%20Hussars\"&gt;Worcestershire Yeomanry&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Horse%20Mounted%20Brigade\"&gt;Scottish Horse Mounted Brigade&lt;/a&gt; landed as Suvla on 2 September and joined the division. Likewise, the &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Mounted%20Brigade\"&gt;Highland Mounted Brigade&lt;/a&gt; joined the division after landing on 26 September. Both brigades were dismounted in the UK before sailing directly for Gallipoli.\nReturn to Egypt.\nThe division returned to Egypt from Gallipoli in December 1915 and was reformed and remounted. The artillery batteries and other units left in Egypt rejoined the division between 10 and 20 December 1915. However, the dismemberment of the division began almost immediately as units were posted to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Frontier%20Force\"&gt;Western Frontier Force&lt;/a&gt; or to various other commands.\nOn 21 January 1916, 2nd Mounted Division was disbanded.\nCommanders.\nThe 2nd Mounted Division had the following commanders:"
