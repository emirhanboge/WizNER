    "text": "This list of compositions by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Schumann\"&gt;Robert Schumann&lt;/a&gt; is classified into &lt;a href=\"piano\"&gt;piano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vocal%20music\"&gt;vocal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orchestra\"&gt;orchestra&lt;/a&gt;l and &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20music\"&gt;chamber&lt;/a&gt; works. All works are also listed separately, by &lt;a href=\"opus%20number\"&gt;opus number&lt;/a&gt;. Schumann wrote almost exclusively for the piano until 1840, when he burst into song composition around the time of his marriage to &lt;a href=\"Clara%20Schumann\"&gt;Clara Wieck&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy opus number.\nNote that Opus 1-23 are all written for piano solo."
