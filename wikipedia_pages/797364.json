    "text": "A fleet or naval fleet is a large &lt;a href=\"formation%20%28military%29\"&gt;formation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"warships\"&gt;warships&lt;/a&gt; - the largest formation in any &lt;a href=\"navy\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; - controlled by one leader. A fleet at &lt;a href=\"sea\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt; is the direct equivalent of an &lt;a href=\"Field%20army\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; on land.\nPurpose.\nIn the modern sense, fleets are usually, but not necessarily, permanent formations and are generally assigned to a particular &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sea\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt;. Most fleets are named after that ocean or sea, but the convention in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; is to use numbers.\nA fleet is normally commaded by an &lt;a href=\"fleet%20admiral\"&gt;admiral&lt;/a&gt;, who is often also a &lt;a href=\"commander%20in%20chief\"&gt;commander in chief&lt;/a&gt;, but many fleets have been or are commanded by &lt;a href=\"vice%20admiral\"&gt;vice admiral&lt;/a&gt;s or even &lt;a href=\"rear%20admiral\"&gt;rear admiral&lt;/a&gt;s. Most fleets are divided into several &lt;a href=\"Squadron%20%28naval%29\"&gt;squadrons&lt;/a&gt;, each under a subordinate admiral. Those squadrons in turn are often divided into divisions. In the &lt;a href=\"age%20of%20sail\"&gt;age of sail&lt;/a&gt;, fleets were divided into van, centre and rear squadrons, named after each squadron\u2019s place in the &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20battle\"&gt;line of battle&lt;/a&gt;. In more modern times, the squadrons are typically composed of homogeneous groups of the same class of &lt;a href=\"warship\"&gt;warship&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"battleships\"&gt;battleships&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cruisers\"&gt;cruisers&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince many smaller &lt;a href=\"navy\"&gt;navies&lt;/a&gt; contain a single fleet, the term \"the fleet\" is often synonymous with \"the navy\".\nMultinational fleets are not uncommon in naval history. For example, several nations made up the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20League%20%28Mediterranean%29\"&gt;Holy League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Lepanto%20order%20of%20battle\"&gt;fleet&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Lepanto%20%281571%29\"&gt;Battle of Lepanto&lt;/a&gt; in 1571, and a Franco-Spanish fleet faced the British Royal Navy at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Trafalgar\"&gt;Battle of Trafalgar&lt;/a&gt; in 1805. In modern times, &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; has formed standing combined fleets and operations from several national navies such as &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Active%20Endeavour\"&gt;Operation Active Endeavour&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe modern fleet.\nModern fleets combine &lt;a href=\"Surface%20combatant\"&gt;surface warships&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"submarines\"&gt;submarines&lt;/a&gt;, support ships and ship-based aircraft to conduct naval operations at sea. Generally understood to be the &lt;a href=\"Blue-water%20navy\"&gt;blue water&lt;/a&gt;, or oceanic, &lt;a href=\"Green-water%20navy\"&gt;green water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"littoral\"&gt;littoral&lt;/a&gt; versus the &lt;a href=\"Brown-water%20navy\"&gt;brown water&lt;/a&gt; or coastal/riverine forces. The fleets of larger navies are usually divided into smaller numbered or named fleets based on geographic operating areas or on administrative groupings of same type ships.\nModern fleets are usually administrative units. Typically, individual &lt;a href=\"task%20force\"&gt;task force&lt;/a&gt;s are formed to conduct specific operations."
