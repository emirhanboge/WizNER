Altogether, in 987 innings, Cain allowed 1,119 &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; and 569 bases on balls, with 279 &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHis pitching career ended in the &lt;a href=\"minor%20leagues\"&gt;minor leagues&lt;/a&gt; in 1943, although he returned to the game to manage the &lt;a href=\"Vidalia-Lyons%20Twins\"&gt;Vidalia-Lyons Twins&lt;/a&gt; in the Class D &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20League\"&gt;Georgia State League&lt;/a&gt; for part of the 1948 campaign. He died in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; on April 3, 1975, only two days before his 68th birthday."
