    "text": "Tindouf (&lt;a href=\"Berber%20languages\"&gt;Berber&lt;/a&gt;: Tinduf, ) is the main town, and a &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20Algeria\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tindouf%20Province\"&gt;Tindouf Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algeria\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, close to the &lt;a href=\"Algeria%E2%80%93Mauritania%20border\"&gt;Mauritanian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algeria%E2%80%93Western%20Sahara%20border\"&gt;Western Saharan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Algeria%E2%80%93Morocco%20border\"&gt;Moroccan&lt;/a&gt; borders. The commune has population of around 160,000 but the census and population estimates do not count the &lt;a href=\"Sahrawi%20people\"&gt;Sahrawi&lt;/a&gt; refugees making the population as of the 2008 census 45,966, up from 25,266 in 1998, and an annual population growth rate of 6.3%.\nThe region is considered of strategic significance. It houses &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Algeria\"&gt;Algerian military&lt;/a&gt; bases and an &lt;a href=\"Tindouf%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; with regular flights to &lt;a href=\"Algiers\"&gt;Algiers&lt;/a&gt; as well as to other domestic destinations. The settlement of &lt;a href=\"Garet%20Djebilet\"&gt;Garet Djebilet&lt;/a&gt; lies within the &lt;a href=\"municipalities%20of%20Algeria\"&gt;municipal territory&lt;/a&gt; of Tindouf near the border with &lt;a href=\"Mauritania\"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt;; the settlement has an &lt;a href=\"iron%20mine\"&gt;iron mine&lt;/a&gt; and a defunct airport, and is approximately northwest of &lt;a href=\"%C3%82ouinet%20Bel%20Egr%C3%A2\"&gt;\u00c2ouinet Bel Egr\u00e2&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1975, it also contains several &lt;a href=\"Sahrawi%20refugee%20camps\"&gt;Sahrawi refugee camps&lt;/a&gt; , a national &lt;a href=\"liberation%20movement\"&gt;liberation movement&lt;/a&gt; seeking the &lt;a href=\"self-determination\"&gt;self-determination&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Sahara\"&gt;Western Sahara&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nThe town of Tindouf was built near an isolated &lt;a href=\"Sahara%20desert\"&gt;Saharan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"oasis\"&gt;oasis&lt;/a&gt; in 1852 by members of the &lt;a href=\"Tajakant\"&gt;Tajakant&lt;/a&gt; tribe, but sacked and destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Reguibat\"&gt;Reguibat&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;a href=\"Sahrawi%20people\"&gt;Sahrawi&lt;/a&gt; tribe in 1895, and the Tajakant tribe were expelled from the region. It remained deserted until &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; troops arrived in the area in 1934. Since Algerian &lt;a href=\"independence\"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt; in 1962, the town has been deliberately built up, partly because of its importance as a last outpost before the Moroccan, Sahrawi and Mauritanian borders.\nIn 1963, the area was the scene of fighting between Algerian and Moroccan forces laying claim to western Algeria, in the &lt;a href=\"Sand%20War\"&gt;Sand War&lt;/a&gt;. , a Sahrawi nationalist organization fighting for &lt;a href=\"Western%20Sahara\"&gt;Western Sahara&lt;/a&gt;'s independence. , which filled up as Moroccan and Mauritanian forces conquered Western Sahara in 1975. During the war years of 1975\u20131990, Polisario forces struck in Western Sahara, Mauritania (until 1979) and southern &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; (including the region of &lt;a href=\"Tata%2C%20Morocco\"&gt;Tata&lt;/a&gt;), , with Algerian protection and support. Since 1990 the area has been quiet, although the refugee community remains in Algeria, pending a UN-sponsored peace process and a referendum on independence. (See &lt;a href=\"Minurso\"&gt;Minurso&lt;/a&gt;.)\nDemographics.\nTindouf has a population of 47,965 (2010 estimates), though this figure is of questionable authenticity, given the fact that the exact number is a sensitive issue due to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Sahara\"&gt;Sahrawi&lt;/a&gt; refugees, who are excluded from the estimate.\nClimate.\nTindouf has a &lt;a href=\"hot%20desert%20climate\"&gt;hot desert climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; \"BWh\"), with extremely hot summers and very warm winters. There is very little rain for most of the year, generally concentrated in February and \u2014associated with the &lt;a href=\"West%20African%20Monsoon\"&gt;West African Monsoon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 by September\u2013October. The region can be hit by rare events of heavy rain, such as in February 2006 or October 2015. Summer daytime temperatures commonly approach 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F) with blazing sunshine, while winter nighttime temperatures can sometimes drop to 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) or less.\nEducation.\n6.1% of the population has a tertiary education, and another 18.8% has completed secondary education.
