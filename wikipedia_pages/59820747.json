It is a &lt;a href=\"fractured%20granite\"&gt;fractured granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"twin%20summited\"&gt;twin summited&lt;/a&gt; peak, and is close to geographic center of the park. Tuolumne Peak is located approximately northeast of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hoffmann\"&gt;Mount Hoffmann&lt;/a&gt; via a granite &lt;a href=\"ridge-line\"&gt;ridge-line&lt;/a&gt;. It is climbed less often than Hoffman, probably due to a more difficult approach.\nThe mountain is in &lt;a href=\"Mariposa%20County\"&gt;Mariposa County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is &lt;a href=\"rock%20climbing\"&gt;rock climbing&lt;/a&gt;, on Tuolumne Peak.\n&lt;a href=\"Tenaya%20Glacier\"&gt;Tenaya Glacier&lt;/a&gt; had effects, at least near Tuolumne Peak, during the &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20Glacial%20Stage\"&gt;Wisconsin Glacial Stage&lt;/a&gt;, over-topping the ridge that connects Tuolumne Peak to Mount Hoffman, isolating both tops."
