    "text": "Diana Golbi (; born January 16, 1992) is an Israeli singer and actress, the eighth winner of \"&lt;a href=\"Kokhav%20Nolad\"&gt;Kokhav Nolad&lt;/a&gt;\", the Israeli version of \"&lt;a href=\"Pop%20Idol\"&gt;Pop Idol&lt;/a&gt;\". Golbi is the third female participant to win the show (following &lt;a href=\"Ninet%20Tayeb\"&gt;Ninet Tayeb&lt;/a&gt; on the first season and &lt;a href=\"Roni%20Dalumi\"&gt;Roni Dalumi&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Kokhav%20Nolad%207\"&gt;seventh season&lt;/a&gt;).\nPersonal life.\nGolbi was born as Diana Igorevna Golovanova () in Moscow, Russia. When she turned four, her parents decided to immigrate to Israel, and resided in the city of &lt;a href=\"Holon\"&gt;Holon&lt;/a&gt;. During her childhood, Golbi \"fell in love\" with the stage. She studied theatre in an American studio, and when she was 12, she went to perform in a big theatre in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;. She served as an instructor in the &lt;a href=\"C4I%20Corps\"&gt;Teleprocessing Corps&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Defense%20Forces\"&gt;Israel Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nGolbi also loves &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;. She played on a girl team in &lt;a href=\"Petah%20Tikva\"&gt;Petah Tikva&lt;/a&gt;, coached by her father, even though she did prefer performing on stage. During 2008 Golbi and her friends formed a rock band, called HaRusim (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd). HaRusim is a double meaning: it means both \"The Ruined Ones\" and \"The Russian Ones\" in Hebrew, since the members of the band are all &lt;a href=\"1990s%20Post-Soviet%20aliyah\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; originally.\nStudied acting in the &lt;a href=\"Nissan%20Nativ%20Acting%20Studio\"&gt;Nissan Nativ Acting Studio&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aviv\"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; 2015-2018\n\"Kokhav Nolad 8\".\nDuring 2010, Golbi went to audition for the &lt;a href=\"Kokhav%20Nolad%208\"&gt;eighth season of \"Kokhav Nolad\"&lt;/a&gt; and was accepted. In the night of September 4, 2010, she won 53% of the votes and beat &lt;a href=\"Idan%20Amedi\"&gt;Idan Amedi&lt;/a&gt;, and was therefore crowned as the winner of \"Kokhav Nolad 8\". She won a production contract from the music producer &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Lahav\"&gt;Louis Lahav&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"HaKokhav HaBa\".\nIn 2017, Golbi entered the 4th season of &lt;a href=\"HaKokhav%20HaBa\"&gt;HaKokhav HaBa&lt;/a&gt;. In her first performance she sang \"&lt;a href=\"Alive%20%28Sia%20song%29\"&gt;Alive&lt;/a&gt;\", a song which was originally sung by &lt;a href=\"Sia%20Furler\"&gt;Sia&lt;/a&gt;. She got a score of 95% for that performance, which was broadcast on Israeli TV on January 2, 2017. She became the runner-up of the show, after &lt;a href=\"Imri%20Ziv\"&gt;Imri Ziv&lt;/a&gt;."
