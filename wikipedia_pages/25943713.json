It is assigned to the &lt;a href=\"49th%20Wing\"&gt;49th Wing&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Holloman%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Holloman Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, New Mexico and operates &lt;a href=\"General%20Atomics%20MQ-9%20Reaper\"&gt;General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper&lt;/a&gt; unmanned aerial vehicles.\nThe first predecessor of the &lt;a href=\"squadron%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; was activated during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; as the 79th Aero Squadron. It deployed to France in 1917 and was redesignated the 491st Aero Squadron. It served as a construction unit before returning to the United States, where it was demobilized in 1919.\nThe second predecessor of the unit is the 491st Bombardment Squadron, which was constituted as an &lt;a href=\"Organized%20Reserve\"&gt;Organized Reserve&lt;/a&gt; unit in 1924. It was activated in 1925 at &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Point%20Airport\"&gt;Sand Point Airport&lt;/a&gt;, Washington, but was only nominally manned. The two squadrons were consolidated in 1936, but the consolidated unit was inactivated the following year. it was disbanded in May 1942, as were all the other &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps\"&gt;United States Army Air Corps&lt;/a&gt; Organized Reserve units.\nThe third predecessor of the unit is the 491st Bombardment Squadron (Medium), which was constituted and activated in India during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. It participated in combat in the &lt;a href=\"China-Burma-India%20Theater\"&gt;China-Burma-India Theater&lt;/a&gt; until the end of the war, where it earned a &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Unit%20Citation\"&gt;Distinguished Unit Citation&lt;/a&gt;. Following &lt;a href=\"V-J%20Day\"&gt;V-J Day&lt;/a&gt;, it returned to the United States and was inactivated.\nThe squadron was activated in the &lt;a href=\"military%20reserve%20force\"&gt;reserve&lt;/a&gt; in 1947, but was discontinued when &lt;a href=\"Continental%20Air%20Command\"&gt;Continental Air Command&lt;/a&gt; reorganized its reserve units under the &lt;a href=\"Hobson%20Plan\"&gt;wing base organization plan&lt;/a&gt; and reduced their number due to budget constraints. In 1958, it was consolidated with the first two squadrons and activated at &lt;a href=\"Dyess%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Dyess Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, Texas when &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20Air%20Command\"&gt;Strategic Air Command&lt;/a&gt; expanded its &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20B-47%20Stratojet\"&gt;Boeing B-47 Stratojet&lt;/a&gt; wings to four squadrons. The squadron was inactivated at Dyess in 1961.\nHistory.\nWorld War I.\nThe first predecessor of the squadron was organized as the 79th Aero Squadron at &lt;a href=\"Kelly%20Field\"&gt;Kelly Field&lt;/a&gt;, Texas in August 1917. It deployed to the &lt;a href=\"Aviation%20Concentration%20Center\"&gt;Aviation Concentration Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Garden%20City%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Garden City, New York&lt;/a&gt; in November for shipment to France. It arrived in France the following month and moved to &lt;a href=\"Saint-Nazaire\"&gt;Saint-Nazaire&lt;/a&gt;, where it was redesignated the 491st Aero Squadron (Construction) and constructed and maintained facilities from February until December 1918. It returned to the United States in January 1919 and was demobilized. It was reconstituted c. 16 October 1936 and consolidated with the 491st Bombardment Squadron.\nOrganized Reserves between World War I and World War II.\nThe 492d Bombardment Squadron was authorized in the &lt;a href=\"Organized%20Reserves\"&gt;Organized Reserves&lt;/a&gt; in March 1924. It was activated at &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Point%20Airport\"&gt;Sand Point Airport&lt;/a&gt;, Washington in the &lt;a href=\"Ninth%20Corps%20Area\"&gt;Ninth Corps Area&lt;/a&gt; the following January and assigned to the 349th Bombardment Group. The squadron was only nominally manned before it was inactivated in the spring of 1937. Along with all other &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps\"&gt;United States Army Air Corps&lt;/a&gt; Organized Reserve units, it was disbanded in May 1942. In August 1958 it was reconstituted and consolidated with the 492d Bombardment Squadron, Medium.\nWorld War II.\nThe 491st Bombardment Squadron (Medium) was activated in September 1942 as a &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20B-25%20Mitchell\"&gt;North American B-25 Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; bomber squadron at Karachi, India. It was assigned to the newly activated &lt;a href=\"341st%20Bombardment%20Group\"&gt;341st Bombardment Group&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Tenth Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. The squadron did not receive a full complement of aircraft and personnel until the end of the year. After moving to &lt;a href=\"Chakulia%20Airfield\"&gt;Chakulia Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, the squadron began combat operations, flying its first mission on 10 January 1943. For the remainder of the year the squadron was primarily tasked with &lt;a href=\"air%20interdiction\"&gt;interdicting&lt;/a&gt; Japanese &lt;a href=\"lines%20of%20communication\"&gt;lines of communication&lt;/a&gt; in Burma.\nThe squadron was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Fourteenth%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Fourteenth Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and moved to China in January 1944. Again the squadron's primary tasking was interdiction of Japanese lines of communication in China and eastern French Indochina (now Vietnam). In addition to strikes against airfields, bivouac and storage areas and bridges, the unit performed &lt;a href=\"target%20of%20opportunity\"&gt;target of opportunity&lt;/a&gt; sweeps along roads, rivers and over the Gulf of Tonkin and the South China Sea.\nWhen Japan surrendered, sixteen squadron aircrews and several aircraft maintenance personnel were in India undergoing transition training to &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20A-26%20Invader\"&gt;Douglas A-26 Invader&lt;/a&gt;. About 31 August 1945 the remaining 491st personnel joined those in India. Those determined to meet rotation requirements embarked on a transport ship and returned to the United States, arriving on 1 November. The squadron was inactivated at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Kilmer\"&gt;Camp Kilmer&lt;/a&gt;, New Jersey on 2 November 1945.\nCold War.\nThe unit was redesignated 491st Bombardment Squadron, Light on 26 May 1947 and activated in the &lt;a href=\"military%20reserve%20force\"&gt;reserve&lt;/a&gt; on 5 June. The squadron was inactivated on 27 June 1949 when &lt;a href=\"Continental%20Air%20Command\"&gt;Continental Air Command&lt;/a&gt; reorganized its operational reserve units under the &lt;a href=\"Hobson%20Plan\"&gt;wing base organizational model&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe squadron was redesignated 491st Bombardment Squadron, Medium on 20 August 1958 and consolidated with the 491st Bombardment Squadron. It was activated on 1 November and assigned to the &lt;a href=\"341st%20Bombardment%20Wing\"&gt;341st Bombardment Wing&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dyess%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Dyess Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; operating the &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20B-47%20Stratojet\"&gt;Boeing B-47 Stratojet&lt;/a&gt;. In March 1961, President &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; directed that the phaseout of the B-47 be accelerated. The squadron was inactivated on 25 June 1961 as part of that draw down, and its aircraft were sent to storage at &lt;a href=\"Davis%E2%80%93Monthan%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, Arizona.\nLineage.\n491st Aero Squadron\n491st Bombardment Squadron\n491st Attack Squadron\nExternal links.\n&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20B-47%20units%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;List of B-47 units of the United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt;"
