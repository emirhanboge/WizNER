    "text": "Many sports are played by the people of &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; including both traditional sports and &lt;a href=\"sport\"&gt;sport&lt;/a&gt;s from other countries.\nTraditional Sports.\nSilambattam.\nSilambam is a weapon-based Indian martial art originating in South India in the Indian subcontinent which is being played as a traditional sport even in this modern days. This style is mentioned in Tamil Sangam literature [1] The World Silambam Association is the official international body of Silambam. It is the most important traditional sport of Tamil nadu which is involved with the lives of people since sangam age. It is a sport as well as self defencing and attacking techniques. It is the most oldest form of martial art originated from South India\nKabaddi.\n&lt;a href=\"Kabaddi\"&gt;Kabaddi&lt;/a&gt; is the state sport of Tamil Nadu. The word \"kabadi\" is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20language\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt; word \"kai-pudi\"(\u0b95\u0bc8\u0baa\u0bbf\u0b9f\u0bbf) meaning \"to hold hands\". It is also known as \"sadu-gudu\".\nKabaddi \u2013 the State Sport of Tamil Nadu\nOf the many sports played in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, both traditional as well as foreign sports, kabaddi takes the honor for being the state sport. It\u2019s derived from the Tamil word \u2018kai-pudi\u2019, meaning \u2018to hold hands\u2019. Kabaddi is an ancient contact sport which\u2019s origins can be traced back to about 4000 years ago in Indian mythology during the Mahabharata period. Buddhist literatures also have citing of Lord Buddha playing kabaddi as a recreational sport. Kabadi is played as a mock up practise prior to the traditional sport Jallikattu later it is spread over as a commercial sport.\nIt\u2019s known by different names in different places such as \u2018bhavatik\u2019 in Maldives, \u2018kauddi\u2019 in Punjab and \u2018hadudu\u2019 in Bengal. At this point it\u2019s important to note that some other states like Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana also recognize kabaddi as their state sport.\nThe essence of this game is for the defending team to hold onto the raiding team in their pitch. Though there are slight variations in the game played in different places, the basic rules are the same. India introduced this sport on a world platform during the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. It was popularized in Japan in 1979, Bangladesh in 1973 and Iran in 1996. It is the National Sport of Bangladesh and one of the national sports of Nepal.\nThis game is often called the \u2018game of the masses\u2019 as it holds a lot of public appeal due to its simplicity and games are watched with a great deal of gusto and raucous cheering. So far, India has been indomitable at all the international kabaddi tournaments and with seven World Cup titles and numerous Asian Games gold medals, the Indian men\u2019s team is at the pinnacle of success.\nIn Tamil Nadu, kabaddi is more than just a game; it\u2019s a sport that\u2019s ingrained into the minds right from childhood when all that\u2019s required is an open ground, a few friends and the enthusiasm for the game, muttering \u2018kabaddi, kabaddi\u2019 as they maneuver through the opponents team. Stamina and agility are two key strengths that are needed for this game and Tamil Nadu has done the country proud by producing many players who have been part of the winning national team.\nThere are two main formats of kabaddi being played today with the main essence of the sport remaining the same, only the size and shape of the pitch and some of the rules being at variance. In the \u2018International Rules\u2019 kabaddi, a rectangular court of 13 x 10m dimension is required while in the \u2018Circle- style\u2019 kabaddi, a circular pitch with a radius of 11m is needed; both formats have their own separate World Cup tournaments.\nWith India being a cricket-crazy nation, kabaddi is holding up its own as enthusiasm for this sport never wanes.\nSeval Sandai.\nSeval Sandai or Seval Porr (cockfighting) is a popular rural sport in Tamil Nadu. Three or four-inch blades are attached to the cocks' feet and the winner is decided after three or four rounds of no holds barred fighting. The sport involves major gambling in recent times. Cockfighting in Tamil Nadu is mentioned in ancient literature like Manu Needhi Sastiram, Kattu Seval Sastiram and other Sangam literature. It is referred to as the favorite pastime for the warriors of Tamil country and is acknowledged as one amongst the 64 great arts.\nIt involves basically fighting skills for your chicken.\nNow it is widely played in the places of North America and Asia\nJallikattu.\n&lt;a href=\"Jallikattu\"&gt;Jallikattu&lt;/a&gt; is a popular bull taming sport practiced particularly during &lt;a href=\"Pongal%20%28festival%29\"&gt;Pongal&lt;/a&gt; festival. Jallikattu was a popular sport since the Sangam period and Tamil classical period. Jallikattu (or sallikkattu), also known as eru thazhuvuthal and manju virattu, is a traditional spectacle in which a bull, such as the Pulikulam or Kangayam breeds, is released into a crowd of people, and multiple human participants attempt to grab the large hump on the bull's back with both arms and hang on to it while the bull attempts to escape. Participants hold the hump for as long as possible, attempting to bring the bull to a stop. In some cases, participants must ride long enough to remove flags on the bull's horns].\nRekla.\nRekla is a sport which is a form of bullock cart racing.\nSathurangam.\nChess is believed to have originated in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, c. 280 \u2013 550 CE, where its early form in Tamil Nadu was known as \"&lt;a href=\"chaturanga\"&gt;Sathurangam&lt;/a&gt;\" literally \"four divisions\" [of the military]\u00a0\u2013 &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cavalry\"&gt;cavalry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"war%20elephant\"&gt;elephants&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"chariot\"&gt;chariot&lt;/a&gt;ry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.\nModern day chess is a widely popular game in the state and &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu%20State%20Chess%20Association\"&gt;Tamil Nadu State Chess Association&lt;/a&gt; is the apex body for the game of chess in Tamil Nadu.
