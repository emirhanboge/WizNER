    "text": "Far from the Maddening Crowds is the debut studio album by British &lt;a href=\"electronic%20music\"&gt;electronic music&lt;/a&gt; artist &lt;a href=\"Chicane%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Chicane&lt;/a&gt;, released on 20 October 1997 through Xtravaganza Recordings. It is highly regarded as a seminal release in the &lt;a href=\"trance%20music\"&gt;trance music&lt;/a&gt; community, and was highly sought after, having been shelved for licensing issues, until its re-release on 18 October 2007. The album includes Chicane's debut single, \"&lt;a href=\"Offshore%20%28song%29\"&gt;Offshore&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as other singles \"&lt;a href=\"Sunstroke%20%28song%29\"&gt;Sunstroke&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Lost You Somewhere\" and \"Red Skies\". The album charted in the UK on release, peaking at number 49.\nBackground.\nChicane was originally formed as an electronic music duo under the name Disco Citizens, comprising Nick Bracegirdle and Leo Elstob. The duo released their debut single, \"Right Here, Right Now\", in 1995 through &lt;a href=\"Deconstruction%20Records\"&gt;Deconstruction Records&lt;/a&gt; to success, with the song reaching number 40 in the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. Chicane was intended as a side project of the act, however they only saw one release as a duo, the \"&lt;a href=\"Offshore%20%28song%29\"&gt;Offshore&lt;/a&gt;\" EP through Cyanide Records. After \"Offshore\"'s release as a single in 1996, the song quickly garnered success, debuting at number 1 on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Dance%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Dance Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. After this Elstob left the duo, and Chicane (and Disco Citizens) became the solo moniker of Nick Bracegirdle. He soon signed to Alex Gold's record label, Xtravaganza Recordings, who showed interest in releasing a full album by Chicane.\nRelease.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Offshore%20%28song%29\"&gt;Offshore&lt;/a&gt;\", the earliest song produced and released, is also among the best-known of Chicane's tracks; aside from single sales and being a major &lt;a href=\"nightclub\"&gt;dance club&lt;/a&gt; hit, resulting on its inclusion on what has been said to be over 130 &lt;a href=\"compilation%20album\"&gt;compilation album&lt;/a&gt;s. It has also been featured in the UK on TV programs ranging from travel reviews to the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Gardener%27s%20World\"&gt;Gardener's World&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grandstand%20%28BBC%29\"&gt;Grandstand&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe album was released on 20 October 1997 through Xtravaganza recordings, with singles \"Offshore\", \"&lt;a href=\"Sunstroke%20%28song%29\"&gt;Sunstroke&lt;/a&gt;\" on 2 June 1997, and \"Lost You Somewhere\" on 8 December 1997. A vocal edit of \"Offshore\", titled \"&lt;a href=\"Offshore%20%2797\"&gt;Offshore '97&lt;/a&gt;\", was mixed by &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Pappa\"&gt;Anthony Pappa&lt;/a&gt; and credited as a collaboration with Power Circle. It was released as a single on 1 September 1997 and was featured on the album. A &lt;a href=\"Benelux\"&gt;Benelux&lt;/a&gt; single release of \"Red Skies\" was also issued in 1998. After its release, the album appeared on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Albums%20Chart\"&gt;UK Albums Chart&lt;/a&gt; for one week, reaching number 49. In 2007, after its re-release, the album appeared on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Dance%20Albums%20Chart\"&gt;UK Dance Albums Chart&lt;/a&gt; for one week, peaking at number 36.\nCritical reception.\n\"Far from the Maddening Crowds\" received positive reviews from critics upon and after its release. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from &lt;a href=\"Allmusic\"&gt;Allmusic&lt;/a&gt; reviewed the album in 1997, and praised its variety, writing that \"[Chicane] has mastered not only house-styled thumpers, but also spacious, near-ambient soundscapes\". He summarised the review describing the album as \"cinematic\" and \"a successful debut\", rating it four stars out of five. Will Alexander from Trance Critic reviewed the album in 2007, summarising it with \"[\"Far from the Maddening Crowds\" is] still as relevant and inspiring as the day it was created\", and rated it five stars out of five.\nPersonnel.\nAdapted from liner notes"
