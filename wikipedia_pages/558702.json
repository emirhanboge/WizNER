    "text": "Ireland (and predecessor states).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Executive%20%28government%29\"&gt;executive&lt;/a&gt; branch of the modern state of &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; is titled the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Government of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. It has had this title since the &lt;a href=\"adoption%20of%20the%20Constitution%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;adoption of the Constitution of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in 1937. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20D%C3%A1il%20%C3%89ireann\"&gt;Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Republic\"&gt;Irish Republic&lt;/a&gt;, from operated from 1919 to 1922. This overlapped with the &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20Government%20of%20Ireland%20%281922%29\"&gt;Provisional Government&lt;/a&gt; which was put in place after the approval of the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Irish%20Treaty\"&gt;Anglo-Irish Treaty&lt;/a&gt; in January 1922. Both these cabinets ceased to operate from December 1922, on the coming into being of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt;. From 1922 to 1937, the cabinet was known as the &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Council%20of%20the%20Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Executive Council of the Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthern Ireland.\nThe most recently devolved branch of Northern Ireland is known as the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20Executive\"&gt;Northern Ireland Executive&lt;/a&gt;, established under the &lt;a href=\"Good%20Friday%20Agreement\"&gt;Good Friday Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. The Executive has been in operation, intermittently, since 1999, and is current operational. Since 1921, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; has been governed by two other &lt;a href=\"Devolution\"&gt;devolved cabinets&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council%20of%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Executive Committee of the Privy Council&lt;/a&gt; from 1921\u201372 and the &lt;a href=\"Executive%20of%20the%201974%20Northern%20Ireland%20Assembly\"&gt;Northern Ireland Executive&lt;/a&gt; of 1974. Northern Ireland has also been governed by &lt;a href=\"Direct%20rule%20over%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;direct rule&lt;/a&gt; from 1972\u201374, 1974\u201398 and 2002\u201307."
