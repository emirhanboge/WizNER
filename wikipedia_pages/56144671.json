    "text": "Sixtus ( or \"Sike\"; died 1285 or 1286) was a Hungarian clergyman in the 13th century, who served as a skilled diplomat of King &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9la%20IV%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;B\u00e9la IV of Hungary&lt;/a&gt; for decades.\nEarly life.\nSixtus was presumably born around 1220 into a lower noble family, which possessed lands and fields in &lt;a href=\"Chot%C3%ADn\"&gt;Het\u00e9ny&lt;/a&gt; (today Chot\u00edn in &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;). His permanent honorary title of \"magister\" demonstrates his university degree (possibly he studied in &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Paris\"&gt;Sorbonne&lt;/a&gt; or other Paris-type cathedral schools, gaining rhetorical and legal erudition). In contemporary records, he is first referred to as a cleric by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Innocent%20IV\"&gt;Pope Innocent IV&lt;/a&gt; on 20 February 1245, when he authorized papal legate &lt;a href=\"Giacomo%20da%20Pecorara\"&gt;Giacomo da Pecorara&lt;/a&gt; to permit Sixtus' consecration and to grant him the right of possession of &lt;a href=\"Benefice\"&gt;church benefices&lt;/a&gt; despite his \"lack of origin\". The document says Sixtus was the son of a lowborn priest. Sixtus had a sister Joanna, who married Lawrence, a landowner in Sz\u0151ll\u0151s (today &lt;a href=\"Vinodol%2C%20Nitra\"&gt;Vinodol, Nitra&lt;/a&gt;). Their marriage produced several children. His other brother-in-law Ampud of Macsala was also a landowner in Het\u00e9ny. Through the paternal branch, he was related to &lt;a href=\"Mik%C3%B3%20Sz%C3%A9cs\"&gt;Mik\u00f3 Sz\u00e9cs&lt;/a&gt;, a courtier in Esztergom.\nEcclesiastical career.\nHistorian P\u00e9ter Kis assumes Sixtus was identical with a namesake cleric who is mentioned as a \"cantor\" of the Gy\u0151r Chapter by four charters in the period between 1241 and 1248. He also argues Sixtus functioned as dean of &lt;a href=\"St%20Martin%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Bratislava\"&gt;Pressburg Chapter&lt;/a&gt; in 1253. Sixtus is first referred to as \"lector\" of the Esztergom Chapter in 1255. Through his extensive kinship in &lt;a href=\"Esztergom%20County\"&gt;Esztergom County&lt;/a&gt;, he could compensate his nuclear family's relatively low origin. Besides his duty to proclaim the Scripture readings used in the Liturgy of the Word, Sixtus was responsible for management of the cathedral school of Esztergom and teaching the clerics and the poor scholars, in accordance with Canon 18 of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran\"&gt;Third Council of the Lateran&lt;/a&gt; (1179). Thus he was also styled as \"scholasticus\" in contemporary documents. Additionally, Sixtus led the local &lt;a href=\"place%20of%20authentication\"&gt;place of authentication&lt;/a&gt; in this capacity. Approximately thirty charters remain from Sixtus' term. For this role, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Charles I of Sicily&lt;/a&gt; referred to him as \"chancellor of Esztergom\" () in 1270. Sixtus occasionally also used this title thereafter.\nSixtus resigned as \"lector\", when he was sent as head of the Hungarian diplomatic mission to Rome, from 1258 to 1264. Then he became archdeacon of &lt;a href=\"Kom%C3%A1rno\"&gt;Kom\u00e1rom&lt;/a&gt; (present-day Kom\u00e1rno, Slovakia). On 15 July 1264, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Urban%20IV\"&gt;Pope Urban IV&lt;/a&gt; ordered &lt;a href=\"Vincent%2C%20Bishop%20of%20Nyitra\"&gt;Vincent, Bishop of Nyitra&lt;/a&gt; (or Nitra) to provide a dignity and benefice for Sixtus either in &lt;a href=\"Zagreb%20Cathedral\"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; or other cathedrals, or perhaps in a church of the Archdiocese of Esztergom, because he \"wants to leave\" his position of archdeacon in Kom\u00e1rom (probably due to its extensive administrative obligations). After 1266, Sixtus returned to his office of \"lector\" in Esztergom. In August 1271, after &lt;a href=\"Ottokar%20II%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Ottokar II of Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; invaded the lands north of the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed the archives of the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Nitra\"&gt;Diocese of Nyitra&lt;/a&gt; (Nitra), vice-\"isp\u00e1n\" Michael, &lt;a href=\"Benedict%20III%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20Esztergom\"&gt;Benedict&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arad%20Chapter\"&gt;provost of Arad&lt;/a&gt; and Sixtus were mandated by King &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20V%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Stephen V&lt;/a&gt; to determine the borders of the diocese, cataloging its estates and churches upon the request of Bishop Vincent. In early 1272, Sixtus appeared as an \"&lt;a href=\"ad%20litem\"&gt;ad litem&lt;/a&gt;\" judge to investigate the credibility of the \"&lt;a href=\"Udvornici\"&gt;udvarnik&lt;/a&gt;\" lands countrywide. In this capacity, he traveled the counties of &lt;a href=\"Veszpr%C3%A9m%20County%20%28former%29\"&gt;Veszpr\u00e9m&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zala%20County%20%28former%29\"&gt;Zala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Somogy%20County%20%28former%29\"&gt;Somogy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vas%20County%20%28former%29\"&gt;Vas&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe last appears in contemporary sources on 17 April 1285. A certain Cyprian succeeded him as \"lector\" of Esztergom by 15 August 1286, suggesting Sixtus was deceased by then. In 1287, he is referred to as of \"good memory\" (\"bone memorie\"). Sixtus made his &lt;a href=\"Will%20and%20testament\"&gt;last will and testament&lt;/a&gt; in 1272, along with \"cantor\" Valentine. Accordingly, his gifted lands in Het\u00e9ny was inherited by the Archdiocese of Esztergom. Sixtus stipulated that the archbishop had to finish the construction of the St. Anne monastery in the area. The monastery later belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Monte%20Vergine\"&gt;Williamites&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiplomatic missions.\nBoth Urban IV in 1264 and Charles of Sicily in 1270 referred to Sixtus as a \"royal cleric\", which connected his diplomatic activity. At first, he was sent to Italy in 1258 to represent King B\u00e9la's interests at the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Curia\"&gt;Roman Curia&lt;/a&gt;, as some of his policies gave rise to many conflicts between the Hungarian royal court and the Holy See after the Mongol invasion. Sixtus sold some part of his inherited land in Het\u00e9ny to his relative and neighbour Mik\u00f3 Sz\u00e9cs, in order to finance his diplomatic mission to Rome. He stayed there as the permanent ambassador of the Kingdom of Hungary to the &lt;a href=\"Papal%20States\"&gt;Papal States&lt;/a&gt; until 1264. For instance, Sixtus protested in the name of his king when Pope Urban IV appointed &lt;a href=\"Timothy%2C%20Bishop%20of%20Zagreb\"&gt;Timothy&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Zagreb\"&gt;Bishop of Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; without B\u00e9la's consultation in late 1263. At the same time, the king was angered by the fact too that Pope Urban allowed his opponent &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20I%20B%C3%A1ncsa\"&gt;Cardinal B\u00e1ncsa&lt;/a&gt; to be free to distribute Timothy's benefices in Hungary among his relatives. When the reconciliation of B\u00e9la and his rebellious son Duke Stephen proved to be only temporary in 1263, the king commissioned Sixtus to convince the pope to support B\u00e9la's interests and withdraw support from some pro-Stephen Hungarian prelates. For his loyal service, Sixtus was granted royal land donations from his monarch and spouse Queen &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Laskarina\"&gt;Maria Laskarina&lt;/a&gt; in Het\u00e9ny and &lt;a href=\"Radva%C5%88%20nad%20Dunajom\"&gt;Radv\u00e1ny&lt;/a&gt; (present-day Radva\u0148 nad Dunajom, Slovakia) after returning home, when the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Civil%20War%20%281264%E2%80%931265%29\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; broke out. According to the s of three of B\u00e9la's donation letters, \"[Sixtus] protected us and the right of our crown for many years\". For his merits, Sixtus was also appointed as titular papal chaplain by Pope Urban after 1264. During the years spent in Rome, his envoy companion was a certain Egyed from the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Gy%C5%91r\"&gt;Diocese of Gy\u0151r&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1270, Sixtus was among the members of the Hungarian delegation presumably led by \"magister\" &lt;a href=\"%C3%81kos%20%28chronicler%29\"&gt;\u00c1kos&lt;/a&gt; sent to &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt; which escorted the then twelve-year-old princess &lt;a href=\"Mary%20of%20Hungary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Naples\"&gt;Mary&lt;/a&gt; to marry &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%20of%20Naples\"&gt;Charles the Lame&lt;/a&gt;. Before that he sold another part of Het\u00e9ny for 70 silver coins to Mik\u00f3 Sz\u00e9cs. For Charles of Anjou, Hungary was an important ally, when he forged alliances in the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20Peninsula\"&gt;Balkan Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; to counteract the surrounding great powers, the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Venice\"&gt;Republic of Venice&lt;/a&gt;. Charles' three documents mention Sixtus' stay in the Sicilian royal court at the end of 1270. Charles sent his notary Reginald of Florence as Sixtus' accompaniment. The diplomat returned to Hungary by June 1271. Historian &lt;a href=\"Jen%C5%91%20Sz%C5%B1cs\"&gt;Jen\u0151 Sz\u0171cs&lt;/a&gt; argued chronicler &lt;a href=\"Simon%20of%20K%C3%A9za\"&gt;Simon of K\u00e9za&lt;/a&gt; belonged to Sixtus' \"familia\" and also took part in the diplomatic mission, along with &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20of%20Hungary%20%28historian%29\"&gt;Master Andrew&lt;/a&gt;."
