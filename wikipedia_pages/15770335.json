    "text": "The Singapore Community Shield (also known as the AIA Community Shield due to sponsorship reasons; formerly the Charity Shield) is the curtain-raiser to the &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; season in Singapore. The match is contested between the champions of the previous &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Singapore Premier League&lt;/a&gt; season and the &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Cup\"&gt;Singapore Cup&lt;/a&gt; winners. In a situation when the same team wins both competition, then it is contested between the Singapore Premier League's champions and runners-up.\nThe Community Shield (known then as the Charity Shield) was first contested in 2008. In the inaugural match, the &lt;a href=\"Warriors%20FC\"&gt;Singapore Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Home%20United%20FC\"&gt;Home United&lt;/a&gt; 5\u20134 on penalties following a 1\u20131 draw. The Shield first doubled up as the season\u2019s opening fixture in 2014 and remained so for all subsequent editions, except 2019 and 2020.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20Eastern%20Life\"&gt;Great Eastern&lt;/a&gt; is the co-sponsor for the Community Shield since 2008 and becomes the main sponsor in 2017. &lt;a href=\"Yeo%20Hiap%20Seng\"&gt;Yeo's&lt;/a&gt; is the other co-sponsor for the Community Shield from 2008 till 2016.\nOn 23 February 2019, &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;Football Association of Singapore&lt;/a&gt; (FAS) announced that &lt;a href=\"AIA%20Group\"&gt;AIA Singapore&lt;/a&gt; as the new title sponsor of the Singapore Premier League and Community Shield as part of a two-year agreement."
