    "text": "Otto Peter Leck Fischer (March 26, 1904 \u2013 June 17, 1956) was a &lt;a href=\"Danes\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; writer and playwright. He was the brother of the politician &lt;a href=\"Viggo%20Kampmann\"&gt;Viggo Kampmann&lt;/a&gt;. Fischer was a socially conscious writer that portrayed the modern urban man with a sad, gray everyday life. His literary style was cool and matter-of-fact. Fischer was read and appreciated in his day, but he has since been forgotten (except in literary-history circles), perhaps because he was so closely associated with the time in which he lived and which he portrayed. Fischer made a name for himself in many genres: novels, films, and radio drama. He is buried at &lt;a href=\"Mariebjerg%20Cemetery\"&gt;Mariebjerg Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gentofte\"&gt;Gentofte&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeck Fischer's plays are held in the theater collection at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Library%2C%20Denmark\"&gt;Royal Library&lt;/a&gt;."
