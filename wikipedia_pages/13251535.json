    "text": "The Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of North America (ELDoNA) is a &lt;a href=\"confessional%20Lutheran\"&gt;confessional Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; church body in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. There are twenty-eight pastors in the diocese, serving congregations in Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin plus &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ELDoNA was founded June 6, 2006 at a meeting held at Salem Lutheran Church, &lt;a href=\"Malone%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Malone, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. A second diocesan synod was held August 28 and 29, 2007. The third diocesan synod was held at Christ Lutheran Church in &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Richmond, Missouri&lt;/a&gt; on May 22, 2008, and the fourth in the same location, May 14\u201315, 2009. For the fifth Colloquium and Synod, the diocese returned to Malone, Texas, May 12\u201315, 2010, and met there again for the sixth Colloquium and Synod May 11\u201313, 2011. The sixth Colloquium and Synod was the first in which all but one of the pastors of the diocese and the entire clergy of the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Confessional%20Lutheran%20Churches\"&gt;Association of Confessional Lutheran Churches&lt;/a&gt; (ACLC) were in attendance. Among the significant decisions of the 2011 synod was the resolution to open a diocesan seminary in September 2012; the 2012 synod chose to delay that planned opening to 2014. The 2012 synod took place at Salem Lutheran Church in Malone, Texas the week of April 23\u201327, 2012, and the 2013 synod took place April 29\u2013May 3, 2013.\nIn August 2013 the ACLC broke fellowship with the ELDoNA due to the latter's stand on the doctrine of Objective Justification.\nIn 2006, James Heiser was called to serve as the diocesan bishop. Heiser has published a volume of essays on the doctrine of the holy ministry entitled \"Stewards of the Mysteries of God\". He is also the author of a study of the neo-Platonic revival which took place during the Italian Renaissance, entitled \"Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century\".\nIn 2013, Repristination Press published a volume of essays by Pastor John Rutowicz which sets forth the diocesan understanding of the episcopal office: \"Holding Fast the Faithful Word: Episcopacy and the Office of the Holy Ministry in the Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of North America\".\nThe diocese produces \"The Lutheran Herald\", a monthly devotional journal that also includes diocesan news."
