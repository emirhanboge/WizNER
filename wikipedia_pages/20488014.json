    "text": "Jean Mallot (born 20 August 1952 in &lt;a href=\"Nizerolles\"&gt;Nizerolles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Allier\"&gt;Allier&lt;/a&gt;) was a member of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20of%20France\"&gt;National Assembly of France&lt;/a&gt;. From the &lt;a href=\"2007%20French%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"2012%20French%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2012 legislative elections&lt;/a&gt;, he represented the &lt;a href=\"Allier%27s%203rd%20constituency\"&gt;3rd constituency&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Allier\"&gt;Allier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt;, as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Party%20%28France%29\"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;. Major boundary changes in 2011 reduced Allier's parliamentary entitlement from 4 constituencies down to 3, and the old 3rd constituency was in effect abolished, its name and substantially its place being taken over by the pre-2012 &lt;a href=\"Allier%27s%204th%20constituency\"&gt;4th constituency&lt;/a&gt;. Mallot chose to retire from the National Assembly at the &lt;a href=\"2012%20French%20legislative%20election\"&gt;June 2012 election&lt;/a&gt;."
