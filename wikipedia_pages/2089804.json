It is 58 kilometres west of the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20central%20business%20district\"&gt;Sydney central business district&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Local%20government%20in%20Australia\"&gt;local government area&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Penrith\"&gt;City of Penrith&lt;/a&gt; and is part of the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Western%20Sydney\"&gt;Greater Western Sydney&lt;/a&gt; region.\nEmu Plains is on the western side of the &lt;a href=\"Nepean%20River\"&gt;Nepean River&lt;/a&gt;, located at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Mountains%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Blue Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAboriginal culture.\nPrior to European settlement, what is now Emu Plains was on the border of the Western Sydney-based &lt;a href=\"Darug%20people\"&gt;Darug people&lt;/a&gt; and the Southern Highlands-based &lt;a href=\"Gandangara%20people\"&gt;Gandangara people&lt;/a&gt;, whose land extended into the Blue Mountains. The local Darug people were known as the Mulgoa who lived a &lt;a href=\"hunter-gatherer\"&gt;hunter-gatherer&lt;/a&gt; lifestyle governed by traditional laws, which had their origins in the &lt;a href=\"Dreamtime\"&gt;Dreamtime&lt;/a&gt;. They lived in huts made of bark called 'gunyahs', hunted &lt;a href=\"kangaroo\"&gt;kangaroo&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"emu\"&gt;emu&lt;/a&gt;s for meat, and gathered &lt;a href=\"Yam%20%28vegetable%29\"&gt;yam&lt;/a&gt;s, berries and other native plants.\nEuropean settlement.\nThe first British explorers to visit the area surveyed Emu Plains in August 1790 led by &lt;a href=\"Watkin%20Tench\"&gt;Watkin Tench&lt;/a&gt;, and named it Emu Island after emus they sighted on the land and in the mistaken belief that the land was actually on an island in the &lt;a href=\"Nepean%20River\"&gt;Nepean River&lt;/a&gt;. It was first referred to by its current name by Governor &lt;a href=\"Lachlan%20Macquarie\"&gt;Lachlan Macquarie&lt;/a&gt; on 15 April 1814, when he toured the island also realising that it was not an island but a plain that occasionally flooded giving the appearance of an island. When &lt;a href=\"William%20Cox%20%28pioneer%29\"&gt;William Cox&lt;/a&gt; started building his road over the Blue Mountains from there, The Cox's Road started work at Emu plains on 18 July 1814. A government farm with convict labour was established in 1813 with 1326 convicts working on growing local agriculture. It closed down in 1833 and the land was Gazetted and sold to establishment the village of Emu Plains.\n\"Emu Ferry\" Post Office opened on 1 April 1863 and was renamed \"Emu Plains\" in 1882.\nThe removal of river-stones from the Nepean River for concrete and road-base was begun by the Emu and Prospect Gravel and Road Metal Company in the 1880s. A railway siding, which was to be ultimately expanded into a short branch, was first laid in from the Main Western Line at Emu Plains in 1884. Railway operations, which included their own locomotives, continued until 1967, after when only a siding, shunted by Government trains, remained. All railway operations ceased in 1993.\nEmu Plains has a number of landmark buildings:\nCommercial area.\nThe main commercial centre is Lennox Village (formerly Centro Lennox), named after &lt;a href=\"David%20Lennox\"&gt;David Lennox.&lt;/a&gt;The shopping centre features &lt;a href=\"Aldi\"&gt;Aldi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Woolworths%20Supermarkets\"&gt;Woolworths&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a concrete plant located in town in the industrial area, this plant is owned and operated by &lt;a href=\"Holcim\"&gt;Holcim&lt;/a&gt; Australia, the plant was formerly owned by PF Concrete and currently services the western suburbs region including Penrith six days a week.\nTransport.\n&lt;a href=\"Emu%20Plains%20railway%20station\"&gt;Emu Plains railway station&lt;/a&gt; is situated on the T1 (&lt;a href=\"North%20Shore%20%26amp%3B%20Western%20Line\"&gt;North Shore &amp; Western Line&lt;/a&gt;) of the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Trains\"&gt;Sydney Trains&lt;/a&gt; network.
