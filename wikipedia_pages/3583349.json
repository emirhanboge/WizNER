It has about 35,000 inhabitants and is the least populated &lt;a href=\"Statutory%20city%20%28Czech%20Republic%29\"&gt;statutory city&lt;/a&gt; in the country.\nThe city is an important cultural centre of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20minority%20in%20the%20Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Polish minority in Zaolzie&lt;/a&gt;, which makes up 13.9% of the population (as of 2011).\nT\u0159inec is notable for the &lt;a href=\"T%C5%99inec%20Iron%20and%20Steel%20Works\"&gt;T\u0159inec Iron and Steel Works&lt;/a&gt; steel plant, the largest in the country, which still has a major impact on the city, on its character, demographics, and &lt;a href=\"air%20quality\"&gt;air quality&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdministrative parts.\nT\u0159inec is made up of thirteen town parts and villages:\nEtymology.\nThe name T\u0159inec is of topographic origin, derived from the Slavic word for &lt;a href=\"Reed%20%28plant%29\"&gt;reed&lt;/a&gt; (Polish: \"trzcina\", Czech: \"t\u0159tina\").\nGeography.\nT\u0159inec is located in the historical region of &lt;a href=\"Cieszyn%20Silesia\"&gt;Cieszyn Silesia&lt;/a&gt;. It lies on the &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; border and also near the &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt; border, which is about of the city centre. It is situated approximately away from the city of &lt;a href=\"Ostrava\"&gt;Ostrava&lt;/a&gt; and about from &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;.\nT\u0159inec lies on the &lt;a href=\"Olza%20%28river%29\"&gt;Olza&lt;/a&gt; River. The elevation of the built-up area is approximately above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;. The southern, sparsely populated part of the municipal territory is located in the &lt;a href=\"Moravian-Silesian%20Beskids\"&gt;Moravian-Silesian Beskids&lt;/a&gt; mountain range and the eponymous protected landscape area. The municipal border runs along the peaks of several mountains, including Ostr\u00fd (which is, with an elevation of , the highest point in T\u0159inec), Smr\u010dina, at , \u0160indeln\u00e1, at , and Javorov\u00fd, at .\nClimate.\nT\u0159inec has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20continental%20climate\"&gt;humid continental climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Cfb\" in the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt;).\nHistory.\nThe first written mention of T\u0159inec is from 1444, but the village was probably founded already in the second half of the 14th century. Politically, the village then belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Teschen\"&gt;Duchy of Teschen&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Fee%20%28feudal%20tenure%29\"&gt;fee&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Kingdom of Bohemia&lt;/a&gt;, which after 1526 became part of the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg Monarchy&lt;/a&gt;. In 1770, the village had about 200 inhabitants and was completely agricultural.\nThe area was rich in &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; deposits and had sufficient water energy and a high supply of wood, which were the main reasons to establish an &lt;a href=\"iron%20works\"&gt;iron works&lt;/a&gt; there. The iron mill began operation in 1839, becoming the largest in the entire &lt;a href=\"Cieszyn%20Silesia\"&gt;Cieszyn Silesia&lt;/a&gt;, and became a major milestone in the history of the village, which reoriented itself to industry. After the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Ko%C5%A1ice%E2%80%93Bohum%C3%ADn%20Railway\"&gt;Ko\u0161ice\u2013Bohum\u00edn Railway&lt;/a&gt; line in 1871, rapid development of the town took place.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, a modern &lt;a href=\"municipality\"&gt;municipal division&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in the re-established &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Silesia\"&gt;Austrian Silesia&lt;/a&gt;. The village as a municipality was added to the &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Austria\"&gt;political&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"legal%20district\"&gt;legal district&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cieszyn\"&gt;Cieszyn&lt;/a&gt;. According to censuses conducted in 1880\u20131910, the population of the municipality grew from 1,792 in 1880 to 3,849 in 1910, with a majority being native Polish speakers (growing from 51.4% in 1880 to 96.6% in 1900 and 96% in 1910), accompanied by a German-speaking minority (at most 32.5% in 1880, then dropping to 12.2% in 1900, and up to 24.3% in 1910) and Czech speakers (peaking in 1890 at 17.4%, then dropping to 6.7% in 1910). In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholics\"&gt;Roman Catholics&lt;/a&gt; (63.2%), followed by &lt;a href=\"Protestants\"&gt;Protestants&lt;/a&gt; (34.5%), and &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; (1.9%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Cieszyn%20Vlachs\"&gt;Cieszyn Vlachs&lt;/a&gt;, speaking the &lt;a href=\"Cieszyn%20Silesian%20dialect\"&gt;Cieszyn Silesian dialect&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, the fall of &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Czechoslovak%20War\"&gt;Polish\u2013Czechoslovak War&lt;/a&gt;, and the division of &lt;a href=\"Cieszyn%20Silesia\"&gt;Cieszyn Silesia&lt;/a&gt; in 1920, it became a part of &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovak%20Republic%20%281918-1938%29\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1931, T\u0159inec was promoted to a town.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20Agreement\"&gt;Munich Agreement&lt;/a&gt; in October 1938, together with the &lt;a href=\"Zaolzie\"&gt;Zaolzie&lt;/a&gt; region, it was annexed by &lt;a href=\"Second%20Polish%20Republic\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, administratively adjoined to &lt;a href=\"Cieszyn%20County\"&gt;Cieszyn County&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Silesian%20Voivodeship%20%281920%E2%80%9339%29\"&gt;Silesian Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt;. It was then annexed by &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, it was restored to &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1946, the villages of &lt;a href=\"Ly%C5%BEbice\"&gt;Ly\u017ebice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doln%C3%AD%20L%C3%AD%C5%A1tn%C3%A1\"&gt;Doln\u00ed L\u00ed\u0161tn\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Konsk%C3%A1%20%28T%C5%99inec%29\"&gt;Konsk\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; were joined to T\u0159inec. In 1956\u20131977, a large housing estate was built in Ly\u017ebice, and it became the most populated town part of T\u0159inec. Afterwards, Ly\u017ebice became a new &lt;a href=\"downtown\"&gt;downtown&lt;/a&gt;, taking the place of &lt;a href=\"Star%C3%A9%20M%C4%9Bsto%20%28T%C5%99inec%29\"&gt;Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto&lt;/a&gt; (lit. \"old town\").\nThe municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Guty%20%28T%C5%99inec%29\"&gt;Guty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karpentn%C3%A1\"&gt;Karpentn\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nebory\"&gt;Nebory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%C5%99ichovice%20%28T%C5%99inec%29\"&gt;Old\u0159ichovice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ropice\"&gt;Ropice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyra%20%28T%C5%99inec%29\"&gt;Tyra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vendryn%C4%9B\"&gt;Vendryn\u011b&lt;/a&gt; were joined to T\u0159inec in 1980.
