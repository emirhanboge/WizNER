    "text": "Europe is a &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt; which is also recognised as part of &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt;, located entirely in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Hemisphere\"&gt;Northern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt; and mostly in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Hemisphere\"&gt;Eastern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;. Comprising the westernmost peninsulas of the &lt;a href=\"Continent\"&gt;continental landmass&lt;/a&gt; of Eurasia, it shares the continental landmass of &lt;a href=\"Afro-Eurasia\"&gt;Afro-Eurasia&lt;/a&gt; with both &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It is bordered by the &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Ocean\"&gt;Arctic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; to the north, the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; to the west, the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the south and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be &lt;a href=\"Borders%20of%20the%20continents%23Europe%20and%20Asia\"&gt;separated from Asia&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"drainage%20divide\"&gt;watershed&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20Mountains\"&gt;Ural Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20%28river%29\"&gt;Ural River&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20Sea\"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Caucasus\"&gt;Greater Caucasus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the waterways of the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Straits\"&gt;Turkish Straits&lt;/a&gt;. Although much of this border is over land, Europe is almost always recognised as its own continent because of its great physical size and the weight of its history and traditions.\nEurope covers about , or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it the second-smallest continent (using the &lt;a href=\"Continent%23Number\"&gt;seven-continent model&lt;/a&gt;). Politically, Europe is divided into about &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20sovereign%20states%20and%20dependent%20territories%20in%20Europe\"&gt;fifty sovereign states&lt;/a&gt;, of which &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20European%20countries%20by%20area\"&gt;largest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20countries%20by%20population\"&gt;most populous&lt;/a&gt;, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a &lt;a href=\"Demographics%20of%20Europe\"&gt;total population&lt;/a&gt; of about million (about 10% of the &lt;a href=\"world%20population\"&gt;world population&lt;/a&gt;) in . The &lt;a href=\"European%20climate\"&gt;European climate&lt;/a&gt; is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at &lt;a href=\"latitudes\"&gt;latitudes&lt;/a&gt; along which the climate in Asia and &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.\nEuropean culture is the root of &lt;a href=\"Western%20civilisation\"&gt;Western civilisation&lt;/a&gt;, which traces its lineage back to &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Greece\"&gt;ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Rome\"&gt;ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"fall%20of%20the%20Western%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;fall of the Western Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 476 AD and the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Migration%20Period\"&gt;Migration Period&lt;/a&gt; marked the end of Europe's &lt;a href=\"ancient%20history\"&gt;ancient history&lt;/a&gt;, and the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20humanism\"&gt;Renaissance humanism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20exploration\"&gt;exploration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20art\"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; led to the &lt;a href=\"modern%20era\"&gt;modern era&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Discovery\"&gt;Age of Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, started by Portugal and Spain, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20former%20European%20colonies\"&gt;European powers colonised&lt;/a&gt; at various times the &lt;a href=\"Americas\"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;, almost all of Africa and &lt;a href=\"Oceania\"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt;, and the majority of Asia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Age of Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;, the subsequent &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt; shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, which began in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Europe\"&gt;Western Europe&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the wider world. Both &lt;a href=\"world%20war\"&gt;world war&lt;/a&gt;s took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and the United States took prominence. During the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;, Europe was divided along the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Curtain\"&gt;Iron Curtain&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; in the West and the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt; in the East, until the &lt;a href=\"revolutions%20of%201989\"&gt;revolutions of 1989&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fall%20of%20the%20Berlin%20Wall\"&gt;fall of the Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;dissolution of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1949, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; was founded with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals and prevent future wars. Further &lt;a href=\"European%20integration\"&gt;European integration&lt;/a&gt; by some states led to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU), a separate political entity that lies between a &lt;a href=\"confederation\"&gt;confederation&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"federation\"&gt;federation&lt;/a&gt;. The EU originated in Western Europe but has been &lt;a href=\"Enlargement%20of%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;expanding eastward&lt;/a&gt; since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;, is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's &lt;a href=\"Schengen%20Area\"&gt;Schengen Area&lt;/a&gt; abolishes border, and immigration controls between most of its member states and some non-member states. There exists a political movement favouring the evolution of the European Union into a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20Europe\"&gt;single federation encompassing much of the continent&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nIn classical &lt;a href=\"Greek%20mythology\"&gt;Greek mythology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Europa%20%28consort%20of%20Zeus%29\"&gt;Europa&lt;/a&gt; (, ) was a &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia\"&gt;Phoenicia&lt;/a&gt;n princess. One view is that her name derives from the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; elements () 'wide, broad', and (, &lt;a href=\"Genitive%20case\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , ) 'eye, face, countenance', hence their composite would mean 'wide-gazing' or 'broad of aspect'. \"Broad\" has been an &lt;a href=\"epithet\"&gt;epithet&lt;/a&gt; of Earth herself in the reconstructed &lt;a href=\"Proto-Indo-European%20religion\"&gt;Proto-Indo-European religion&lt;/a&gt; and the poetry devoted to it. An alternative view is that of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20S.%20P.%20Beekes\"&gt;Robert Beekes&lt;/a&gt;, who has argued in favour of a Pre-Indo-European origin for the name, explaining that a derivation from would yield a different toponym than Europa. Beekes has located toponyms related to that of Europa in the territory of ancient Greece, and localities such as that of &lt;a href=\"Europus%20%28Almopia%29\"&gt;Europos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29\"&gt;ancient Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere have been attempts to connect to a Semitic term for \"west\", this being either &lt;a href=\"Akkadian%20language\"&gt;Akkadian&lt;/a&gt; meaning 'to go down, set' (said of the sun) or &lt;a href=\"Phoenician%20language\"&gt;Phoenician&lt;/a&gt; 'evening, west', which is at the origin of &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20language\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Litchfield%20West\"&gt;Martin Litchfield West&lt;/a&gt; stated that \"phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor\", while Beekes considers a connection to Semitic languages improbable.\nMost major world languages use words derived from or \"Europa\" to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word , which is an abbreviation of the transliterated name (\"zh\u014du\" means \"continent\"); a similar Chinese-derived term is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, , despite the &lt;a href=\"katakana\"&gt;katakana&lt;/a&gt; being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages, the originally Persian name ('land of the &lt;a href=\"Franks\"&gt;Franks&lt;/a&gt;') is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as or .\nDefinition.\nContemporary definition.\nThe prevalent definition of Europe as a geographical term has been in use since the mid-19th century.\nEurope is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the east and north-east are usually taken to be the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20Mountains\"&gt;Ural Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20River\"&gt;Ural River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20Sea\"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt;; to the south-east, the &lt;a href=\"Caucasus%20Mountains\"&gt;Caucasus Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.\nIslands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of Greenland is usually assigned to &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, although politically belonging to Denmark. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolia (or Asia Minor)&lt;/a&gt;, but is considered part of Europe politically and it is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Africa\"&gt;Northwest Africa&lt;/a&gt; for centuries, but now it is considered to be part of Europe as well.\n\"Europe\", as used specifically in &lt;a href=\"British%20English\"&gt;British English&lt;/a&gt;, may also refer to &lt;a href=\"Continental%20Europe\"&gt;Continental Europe&lt;/a&gt; exclusively.\nThe term \"continent\" usually implies the &lt;a href=\"physical%20geography\"&gt;physical geography&lt;/a&gt; of a large land mass completely or almost completely surrounded by water at its borders. However, the Europe-Asia part of the border is somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent with this definition because of its partial adherence to the Ural and Caucasus Mountains rather than a series of partly joined waterways suggested by cartographer &lt;a href=\"Herman%20Moll\"&gt;Herman Moll&lt;/a&gt; in 1715. These water divides extend with a few relatively small interruptions (compared to the aforementioned mountain ranges) from the Turkish straits running into the Mediterranean Sea to the upper part of the &lt;a href=\"Ob%20River\"&gt;Ob River&lt;/a&gt; that drains into the &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Ocean\"&gt;Arctic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the adoption of the current convention that includes mountain divides, the border between Europe and Asia had been redefined several times since its first conception in &lt;a href=\"classical%20antiquity\"&gt;classical antiquity&lt;/a&gt;, but always as a series of rivers, seas and straits that were believed to extend an unknown distance east and north from the Mediterranean Sea without the inclusion of any mountain ranges.\nThe current division of Eurasia into two continents now reflects &lt;a href=\"East%E2%80%93West%20dichotomy\"&gt;East-West&lt;/a&gt; cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The geographic border between Europe and Asia does not follow any state boundaries and now only follows a few bodies of water. Turkey is generally considered a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20transcontinental%20countries\"&gt;transcontinental country&lt;/a&gt; divided entirely by water, while &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; are only partly divided by waterways. France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom are also transcontinental (or more properly, intercontinental, when oceans or large seas are involved) in that their main land areas are in Europe while pockets of their territories are located on other &lt;a href=\"continents\"&gt;continents&lt;/a&gt; separated from Europe by large bodies of water. Spain, for example, has territories south of the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt; namely &lt;a href=\"Ceuta\"&gt;Ceuta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melilla\"&gt;Melilla&lt;/a&gt; which are parts of &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, and share a border with Morocco. According to the current convention, Georgia and Azerbaijan are transcontinental countries where waterways have been completely replaced by mountains as the divide between continents.\nHistory of the concept.\nEarly history.\nThe first recorded usage of \"Eur\u1e53p\u0113\" as a geographic term is in the &lt;a href=\"Homeric%20Hymn\"&gt;Homeric Hymn&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Delian%20Apollo\"&gt;Delian Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, in reference to the western shore of the &lt;a href=\"Aegean%20Sea\"&gt;Aegean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BCE by &lt;a href=\"Anaximander\"&gt;Anaximander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hecataeus%20of%20Miletus\"&gt;Hecataeus&lt;/a&gt;. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern &lt;a href=\"Rioni%20River\"&gt;Rioni River&lt;/a&gt; on the territory of &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by &lt;a href=\"Herodotus\"&gt;Herodotus&lt;/a&gt; in the 5th century BCE. Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia and Libya (Africa), with the &lt;a href=\"Nile\"&gt;Nile&lt;/a&gt; and the Phasis forming their boundaries\u2014though he also states that some considered the &lt;a href=\"Don%20River%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;River Don&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia. Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt; at the River Don. The \"&lt;a href=\"Jubilees\"&gt;Book of Jubilees&lt;/a&gt;\" described the continents as the lands given by &lt;a href=\"Noah\"&gt;Noah&lt;/a&gt; to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Hercules\"&gt;Pillars of Hercules&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Gibraltar\"&gt;Strait of Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;, separating it from &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Africa\"&gt;Northwest Africa&lt;/a&gt;, to the Don, separating it from Asia.\nThe convention received by the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; and surviving into modern usage is that of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20era\"&gt;Roman era&lt;/a&gt; used by Roman-era authors such as &lt;a href=\"Posidonius\"&gt;Posidonius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy\"&gt;Ptolemy&lt;/a&gt;, who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.\nThe term \"Europe\" is first used for a cultural sphere in the &lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20Renaissance\"&gt;Carolingian Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Church\"&gt;Western Church&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to both the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; churches and to the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20world\"&gt;Islamic world&lt;/a&gt;.\nA cultural definition of Europe as the lands of &lt;a href=\"Christendom\"&gt;Latin Christendom&lt;/a&gt; coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with &lt;a href=\"Byzantium\"&gt;Byzantium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, and limited to northern &lt;a href=\"Iberia\"&gt;Iberia&lt;/a&gt;, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy. The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the &lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20Renaissance\"&gt;Carolingian Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;: \"Europa\" often figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, &lt;a href=\"Alcuin\"&gt;Alcuin&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern definitions.\nThe question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of &lt;a href=\"Tsardom%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Muscovy&lt;/a&gt; began to include &lt;a href=\"North%20Asia\"&gt;North Asia&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt; into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Straits\"&gt;Turkish Straits&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kerch%20Strait\"&gt;Kerch Strait&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Azov\"&gt;Sea of Azov&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Don%20River%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; (ancient &lt;a href=\"Tanais\"&gt;Tanais&lt;/a&gt;). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at &lt;a href=\"Kalach-na-Donu\"&gt;Kalach-na-Donu&lt;/a&gt; (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the &lt;a href=\"Volga%E2%80%93Don%20Canal\"&gt;Volga\u2013Don Canal&lt;/a&gt;), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers. Around 1715, &lt;a href=\"Herman%20Moll\"&gt;Herman Moll&lt;/a&gt; produced a map showing the northern part of the &lt;a href=\"Ob%20River\"&gt;Ob River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Irtysh%20River\"&gt;Irtysh River&lt;/a&gt;, a major tributary of the former, as components of a series of partly-joined waterways taking the boundary between Europe and Asia from the Turkish Straits, and the Don River all the way to the Arctic Ocean. In 1721, he produced a more up to date map that was easier to read. However, his idea to use major rivers almost exclusively as the line of demarcation was never taken up by other geographers.\nFour years later, in 1725, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Johan%20von%20Strahlenberg\"&gt;Philip Johan von Strahlenberg&lt;/a&gt; was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by proposing that mountain ranges could be included as boundaries between continents whenever there were deemed to be no suitable waterways, the Ob and Irtysh rivers notwithstanding. He drew a new line along the &lt;a href=\"Volga%20River\"&gt;Volga&lt;/a&gt;, following the Volga north until the &lt;a href=\"Samara%20Bend\"&gt;Samara Bend&lt;/a&gt;, along &lt;a href=\"Obshchy%20Syrt\"&gt;Obshchy Syrt&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"drainage%20divide\"&gt;drainage divide&lt;/a&gt; between Volga and &lt;a href=\"Ural%20River\"&gt;Ural&lt;/a&gt;), and then north along &lt;a href=\"Ural%20Mountains\"&gt;Ural Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. This was endorsed by the Russian Empire and introduced the convention that would eventually become commonly accepted, but not without criticism by many modern analytical geographers like &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Mackinder\"&gt;Halford Mackinder&lt;/a&gt; who saw little validity in the Ural Mountains as a boundary between continents.\nThe mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The published by the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;Russian Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as &lt;a href=\"Serafimovich%20%28town%29\"&gt;Serafimovich&lt;/a&gt; before cutting north towards &lt;a href=\"Arkhangelsk\"&gt;Arkhangelsk&lt;/a&gt;, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as &lt;a href=\"John%20Cary\"&gt;John Cary&lt;/a&gt; followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the &lt;a href=\"Kuma%E2%80%93Manych%20Depression\"&gt;Kuma\u2013Manych Depression&lt;/a&gt; was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Simon%20Pallas\"&gt;Peter Simon Pallas&lt;/a&gt;, as a valley that once connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.\nBy the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the &lt;a href=\"Volga%E2%80%93Don%20Canal\"&gt;Volga\u2013Don Canal&lt;/a&gt; and the Volga, the other following the Kuma\u2013Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Caucasus%20watershed\"&gt;Greater Caucasus watershed&lt;/a&gt; to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a \"controversy\" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Freshfield\"&gt;Douglas Freshfield&lt;/a&gt; advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the \"best possible\", citing support from various \"modern geographers\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, the boundary along the Kuma\u2013Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906. In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from &lt;a href=\"Baydaratskaya%20Bay\"&gt;Baydaratskaya Bay&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Kara%20Sea\"&gt;Kara Sea&lt;/a&gt;, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20River\"&gt;Ural River&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Mugodzhar%20Hills\"&gt;Mugodzhar Hills&lt;/a&gt;, and then the &lt;a href=\"Emba%20River\"&gt;Emba River&lt;/a&gt;; and Kuma\u2013Manych Depression, thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe. However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest, and this became the common convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma\u2013Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.\nSome view separation of &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt; into Asia and Europe as a residue of &lt;a href=\"Eurocentrism\"&gt;Eurocentrism&lt;/a&gt;: \"In physical, cultural and historical diversity, &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].\"\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Homo%20erectus%20georgicus\"&gt;Homo erectus georgicus&lt;/a&gt;\", which lived roughly 1.8 million years ago in &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, is the earliest &lt;a href=\"Hominini\"&gt;hominin&lt;/a&gt; to have been discovered in Europe. &lt;a href=\"Homo%20antecessor\"&gt;Other&lt;/a&gt; hominin remains, dating back roughly 1 million years, have been discovered in &lt;a href=\"Archaeological%20Site%20of%20Atapuerca\"&gt;Atapuerca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Neanderthal%20man\"&gt;Neanderthal man&lt;/a&gt; (named after the &lt;a href=\"Neandertal%20%28valley%29\"&gt;Neandertal valley&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago (115,000 years ago it is found already in the territory of present-day &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;) and disappeared from the fossil record about 28,000 years ago, with their final refuge being present-day &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. The Neanderthals were supplanted by modern humans (&lt;a href=\"Cro-Magnons\"&gt;Cro-Magnons&lt;/a&gt;), who appeared in Europe around 43,000 to 40,000 years ago. The earliest sites in Europe dated 48,000 years ago are &lt;a href=\"Riparo%20Mochi\"&gt;Riparo Mochi&lt;/a&gt; (Italy), &lt;a href=\"Geissenkl%C3%B6sterle\"&gt;Geissenkl\u00f6sterle&lt;/a&gt; (Germany) and &lt;a href=\"Isturitz\"&gt;Isturitz&lt;/a&gt; (France).\nThe &lt;a href=\"European%20Neolithic\"&gt;European Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; period\u2014marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery\u2014began around 7000 BCE in &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt;, probably influenced by earlier farming practices in &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Near%20East\"&gt;Near East&lt;/a&gt;. It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rhine\"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Linear%20Pottery%20culture\"&gt;Linear Pottery culture&lt;/a&gt;), and along the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20coast\"&gt;Mediterranean coast&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Cardial%20Ware\"&gt;Cardial culture&lt;/a&gt;). Between 4500 and 3000 BCE, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artifacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as &lt;a href=\"causewayed%20enclosure\"&gt;causewayed enclosure&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"burial%20mound\"&gt;burial mound&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"megalithic%20tomb\"&gt;megalithic tomb&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Corded%20Ware\"&gt;Corded Ware&lt;/a&gt; cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the &lt;a href=\"Chalcolithic\"&gt;Chalcolithic&lt;/a&gt;. During this period giant &lt;a href=\"megalithic\"&gt;megalithic&lt;/a&gt; monuments, such as the &lt;a href=\"Megalithic%20Temples%20of%20Malta\"&gt;Megalithic Temples of Malta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stonehenge\"&gt;Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt;, were constructed throughout Western and Southern Europe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"European%20Bronze%20Age\"&gt;European Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt; began c. 3200 BCE in Greece with the &lt;a href=\"Minoan%20civilization\"&gt;Minoan civilisation&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt;, the first advanced civilisation in Europe. The Minoans were followed by the &lt;a href=\"Mycenean%20Greece\"&gt;Myceneans&lt;/a&gt;, who collapsed suddenly around 1200 BCE, ushering the &lt;a href=\"European%20Iron%20Age\"&gt;European Iron Age&lt;/a&gt;. Iron Age colonisation by the &lt;a href=\"Greeks\"&gt;Greeks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phoenicians\"&gt;Phoenicians&lt;/a&gt; gave rise to early &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20basin\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; cities. Early &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Age%20Italy\"&gt;Iron Age Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archaic%20Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; from around the 8th century BCE gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity, whose beginning is sometimes dated to 776 BCE, the year of the first &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nClassical antiquity.\nAncient Greece was the founding culture of Western civilisation. Western &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rationalism\"&gt;rationalist culture&lt;/a&gt; are often attributed to Ancient Greece. The Greek city-state, the &lt;a href=\"polis\"&gt;polis&lt;/a&gt;, was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece. In 508 BCE, &lt;a href=\"Cleisthenes\"&gt;Cleisthenes&lt;/a&gt; instituted the world's first &lt;a href=\"Athenian%20democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt; system of government in &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;. The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"humanism\"&gt;humanism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rationalism\"&gt;rationalism&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Aristotle\"&gt;Aristotle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Socrates\"&gt;Socrates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plato\"&gt;Plato&lt;/a&gt;; in &lt;a href=\"historiography\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Herodotus\"&gt;Herodotus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thucydides\"&gt;Thucydides&lt;/a&gt;; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of &lt;a href=\"Homer\"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt;; in drama with &lt;a href=\"Sophocles\"&gt;Sophocles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Euripides\"&gt;Euripides&lt;/a&gt;, in medicine with &lt;a href=\"Hippocrates\"&gt;Hippocrates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Galen\"&gt;Galen&lt;/a&gt;; and in science with &lt;a href=\"Pythagoras\"&gt;Pythagoras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Euclid\"&gt;Euclid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archimedes\"&gt;Archimedes&lt;/a&gt;. In the course of the 5th century BCE, several of the Greek &lt;a href=\"city%20states\"&gt;city states&lt;/a&gt; would ultimately check the &lt;a href=\"Achaemenid%20Empire\"&gt;Achaemenid Persian&lt;/a&gt; advance in Europe through the &lt;a href=\"Greco-Persian%20Wars\"&gt;Greco-Persian Wars&lt;/a&gt;, considered a pivotal moment in world history, as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as &lt;a href=\"Fifth-century%20Athens\"&gt;Golden Age of Athens&lt;/a&gt;, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilisation. \nGreece was followed by &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, which left its mark on &lt;a href=\"Roman%20law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"politics\"&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Centralized%20government\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; and many more key aspects in western civilisation. By 200 BCE, Rome had conquered &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and over the following two centuries it conquered &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hispania\"&gt;Hispania&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt;n coast, much of the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gaul\"&gt;Gaul&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Britannia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;).\nExpanding from their base in central Italy beginning in the third century BCE, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean Basin and Western Europe by the turn of the millennium. The &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Roman Republic&lt;/a&gt; ended in 27 BCE, when &lt;a href=\"Augustus\"&gt;Augustus&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The two centuries that followed are known as the \"&lt;a href=\"pax%20romana\"&gt;pax romana&lt;/a&gt;\", a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity and political stability in most of Europe. The empire continued to expand under emperors such as &lt;a href=\"Antoninus%20Pius\"&gt;Antoninus Pius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Aurelius\"&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt;, who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20peoples\"&gt;Germanic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Picts\"&gt;Pictish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20people\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; tribes. &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20the%20Great%20and%20Christianity\"&gt;legalised&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20I\"&gt;Constantine I&lt;/a&gt; in 313 CE after three centuries of &lt;a href=\"Persecution%20of%20early%20Christians%20in%20the%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;imperial persecution&lt;/a&gt;. Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of &lt;a href=\"Byzantium\"&gt;Byzantium&lt;/a&gt; (modern-day &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;) which was renamed &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; in his honour in 330 CE. Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 CE and in 391\u2013392 CE, the emperor &lt;a href=\"Theodosius%20I\"&gt;Theodosius&lt;/a&gt; outlawed pagan religions. This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the &lt;a href=\"fall%20of%20the%20Western%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;fall of the Western Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 476 CE; the closure of the pagan &lt;a href=\"Platonic%20Academy\"&gt;Platonic Academy of Athens&lt;/a&gt; in 529 CE; or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century CE.\nEarly Middle Ages.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"decline%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;decline of the Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the \"&lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Migrations\"&gt;Age of Migrations&lt;/a&gt;\". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the &lt;a href=\"Ostrogoths\"&gt;Ostrogoths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Visigoths\"&gt;Visigoths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goths\"&gt;Goths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vandals\"&gt;Vandals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huns\"&gt;Huns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franks\"&gt;Franks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angles\"&gt;Angles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saxons\"&gt;Saxons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slavs\"&gt;Slavs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pannonian%20Avars\"&gt;Avars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bulgars\"&gt;Bulgars&lt;/a&gt; and, later on, the &lt;a href=\"Vikings\"&gt;Vikings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pechenegs\"&gt;Pechenegs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cumans\"&gt;Cumans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magyars\"&gt;Magyars&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; thinkers such as &lt;a href=\"Petrarch\"&gt;Petrarch&lt;/a&gt; would later refer to this as the \"Dark Ages\".\nIsolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe, though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.\nWhile the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Eastern Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt;. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural and military force in Europe. Emperor &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20I\"&gt;Justinian I&lt;/a&gt; presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a &lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Justinian\"&gt;legal code&lt;/a&gt; that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Hagia%20Sophia\"&gt;Hagia Sophia&lt;/a&gt; and brought the Christian church under state control.\nFrom the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Sasanids\"&gt;Sasanid Persians&lt;/a&gt; were severely weakened due to the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian%20wars\"&gt;Byzantine\u2013Sasanian wars&lt;/a&gt;, the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into &lt;a href=\"Asia%20Minor\"&gt;Asia Minor&lt;/a&gt;. In the mid-7th century, following the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Persia\"&gt;Muslim conquest of Persia&lt;/a&gt;, Islam penetrated into the &lt;a href=\"Caucasus\"&gt;Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; region. Over the next centuries Muslim forces took &lt;a href=\"Cyprus%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emirate%20of%20Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emirate%20of%20Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20Islam%20in%20southern%20Italy\"&gt;parts of southern Italy&lt;/a&gt;. Between 711 and 720, most of the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Visigothic%20Kingdom\"&gt;Visigothic Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberia&lt;/a&gt; was brought under &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; rule\u2014save for small areas in the north-west (&lt;a href=\"Asturias\"&gt;Asturias&lt;/a&gt;) and largely &lt;a href=\"Basque%20people\"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; regions in the &lt;a href=\"Pyrenees\"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt;. This territory, under the Arabic name &lt;a href=\"Al-Andalus\"&gt;Al-Andalus&lt;/a&gt;, became part of the expanding &lt;a href=\"Umayyad%20Caliphate\"&gt;Umayyad Caliphate&lt;/a&gt;. The unsuccessful &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%28717%E2%80%93718%29\"&gt;second siege of Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; (717) weakened the &lt;a href=\"Umayyad\"&gt;Umayyad dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Francia\"&gt;Frankish&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Martel\"&gt;Charles Martel&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Tours\"&gt;Battle of Poitiers&lt;/a&gt; in 732, which ended their northward advance. In the remote regions of north-western Iberia and the middle &lt;a href=\"Pyrenees\"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt; the power of the Muslims in the south was scarcely felt. It was here that the foundations of the Christian kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Asturias\"&gt;Asturias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Leon\"&gt;Leon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Galicia\"&gt;Galicia&lt;/a&gt; were laid and from where the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula would start. However, no coordinated attempt would be made to drive the &lt;a href=\"Moors\"&gt;Moors&lt;/a&gt; out. The Christian kingdoms were mainly focussed on their own internal power struggles. As a result, the &lt;a href=\"Reconquista\"&gt;Reconquista&lt;/a&gt; took the greater part of eight hundred years, in which period a long list of Alfonsos, Sanchos, Ordo\u00f1os, Ramiros, Fernandos and Bermudos would be fighting their Christian rivals as much as the Muslim invaders.\nDuring the Dark Ages, the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Western Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe, respectively. Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under &lt;a href=\"Clovis%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI\"&gt;Clovis\u00a0I&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Charlemagne\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/a&gt;, a Frankish king of the &lt;a href=\"Carolingian\"&gt;Carolingian&lt;/a&gt; dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed \"&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;\" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.\n&lt;a href=\"East%20Central%20Europe\"&gt;East Central Europe&lt;/a&gt; saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; (. The powerful &lt;a href=\"West%20Slavs\"&gt;West Slavic&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moravia\"&gt;Great Moravia&lt;/a&gt; spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under &lt;a href=\"Svatopluk%20I%20of%20Moravia\"&gt;Svatopluk I&lt;/a&gt; and causing a series of armed conflicts with &lt;a href=\"East%20Francia\"&gt;East Francia&lt;/a&gt;. Further south, the first &lt;a href=\"South%20Slavs\"&gt;South Slavic states&lt;/a&gt; emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"First%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;First Bulgarian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Serbia%20%28early%20medieval%29\"&gt;Serbian Principality&lt;/a&gt; (later &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Serbia%20%28medieval%29\"&gt;Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Croatia\"&gt;Duchy of Croatia&lt;/a&gt; (later &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Croatia%20%28925%E2%80%931102%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Croatia&lt;/a&gt;). To the East, the &lt;a href=\"Kievan%20Rus\"&gt;Kievan Rus&lt;/a&gt; expanded from its capital in &lt;a href=\"Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20the%20Great\"&gt;Vladimir the Great&lt;/a&gt; adopted &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox Christianity&lt;/a&gt; as the religion of state. Further East, &lt;a href=\"Volga%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Volga Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.\nHigh and Late Middle Ages.\nThe period between the year 1000 and 1250 is known as the &lt;a href=\"High%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;High Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Late Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; until c. 1500.\nDuring the High Middle Ages the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20of%20the%2012th%20century\"&gt;Renaissance of the 12th century&lt;/a&gt;. Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;s. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the &lt;a href=\"Maritime%20Republics\"&gt;Maritime Republics&lt;/a&gt; a leading role in the European scene.\nThe Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. &lt;a href=\"Feudalism\"&gt;Feudalism&lt;/a&gt; developed in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; in the Early Middle Ages, and soon spread throughout Europe. A struggle for influence between the &lt;a href=\"nobility\"&gt;nobility&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"monarchy\"&gt;monarchy&lt;/a&gt; in England led to the writing of the \"&lt;a href=\"Magna%20Carta\"&gt;Magna Carta&lt;/a&gt;\" and the establishment of a &lt;a href=\"parliament\"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt;. The primary source of culture in this period came from the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Papacy\"&gt;Papacy&lt;/a&gt; reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An &lt;a href=\"East-West%20Schism\"&gt;East-West Schism&lt;/a&gt; in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Urban%20II\"&gt;Pope Urban II&lt;/a&gt; called for a &lt;a href=\"Crusades\"&gt;crusade&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Muslims\"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; occupying &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Land\"&gt;Holy Land&lt;/a&gt;. In Europe itself, the Church organised the &lt;a href=\"Inquisition\"&gt;Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; against heretics. In the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reconquista\"&gt;Reconquista&lt;/a&gt; concluded with the &lt;a href=\"Granada%20War%23Last%20stand%20at%20Granada\"&gt;fall of Granada in 1492&lt;/a&gt;, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the south-western peninsula.\nIn the east, a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims, and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000. The Empire was weakened following the defeat at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Manzikert\"&gt;Manzikert&lt;/a&gt;, and was weakened considerably by the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%281204%29\"&gt;sack of Constantinople in 1204&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Crusade\"&gt;Fourth Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Although it would recover Constantinople in 1261, &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;fell in 1453&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople was taken&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20peoples\"&gt;Turkic&lt;/a&gt; tribes, such as the &lt;a href=\"Pechenegs\"&gt;Pechenegs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cuman-Kipchak%20Confederation\"&gt;Cuman-Kipchaks&lt;/a&gt;, caused a massive migration of &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20peoples\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt; populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east. Like many other parts of &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt;, these territories were &lt;a href=\"Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Rus\"&gt;overrun by the Mongols&lt;/a&gt;. The invaders, who became known as &lt;a href=\"Tatars\"&gt;Tatars&lt;/a&gt;, were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Horde\"&gt;Golden Horde&lt;/a&gt; with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion, and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries. After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walachia\"&gt;Walachia&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans. From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Moscow&lt;/a&gt; grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480, and eventually becoming the &lt;a href=\"Tsardom%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Tsardom of Russia&lt;/a&gt;. The state was consolidated under &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20III%20the%20Great\"&gt;Ivan III the Great&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20the%20Terrible\"&gt;Ivan the Terrible&lt;/a&gt;, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Famine%20of%201315%E2%80%931317\"&gt;Great Famine of 1315\u20131317&lt;/a&gt; was the first &lt;a href=\"Crisis%20of%20the%20Late%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;crisis&lt;/a&gt; that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages. The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of &lt;a href=\"France%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; was reduced by half. Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines, and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period. Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Death\"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most deadly &lt;a href=\"pandemic\"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;s in human history which killed an estimated 25\u00a0million people in Europe alone\u2014a third of the &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20demography\"&gt;European population&lt;/a&gt; at the time.\nThe plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Boccaccio\"&gt;Giovanni Boccaccio&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Decameron\"&gt;The Decameron&lt;/a&gt;\" (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased &lt;a href=\"persecution%20of%20Jews\"&gt;persecution of Jews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beggars\"&gt;beggars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"leper\"&gt;leper&lt;/a&gt;s. The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying &lt;a href=\"virulence\"&gt;virulence&lt;/a&gt; and mortalities until the 18th century. During this period, more than 100 plague &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20epidemics\"&gt;epidemics&lt;/a&gt; swept across Europe.\nEarly modern period.\nThe Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20humanism\"&gt;new humanism&lt;/a&gt; was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Greece\"&gt;classical Greek&lt;/a&gt; and Arabic knowledge from &lt;a href=\"Monasticism\"&gt;monastic&lt;/a&gt; libraries, often translated from Arabic into &lt;a href=\"Latin%20language\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;. The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20art\"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20science%20in%20the%20Renaissance\"&gt;sciences&lt;/a&gt;, under the joint patronage of &lt;a href=\"Royal%20family\"&gt;royalty&lt;/a&gt;, the nobility, the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; and an emerging merchant class. Patrons in Italy, including the &lt;a href=\"Medici\"&gt;Medici&lt;/a&gt; family of Florentine bankers and the &lt;a href=\"Pope\"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, funded prolific &lt;a href=\"quattrocento\"&gt;quattrocento&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cinquecento\"&gt;cinquecento&lt;/a&gt; artists such as &lt;a href=\"Raphael\"&gt;Raphael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michelangelo\"&gt;Michelangelo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leonardo%20da%20Vinci\"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Schism\"&gt;Western Schism&lt;/a&gt;. During this forty-year period, two popes\u2014one in &lt;a href=\"Avignon\"&gt;Avignon&lt;/a&gt; and one in Rome\u2014claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly. In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Spain and Portugal, the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world. Exploration reached the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Hemisphere\"&gt;Southern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt; in the Atlantic and the Southern tip of Africa. &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Columbus\"&gt;Christopher Columbus&lt;/a&gt; reached the &lt;a href=\"New%20World\"&gt;New World&lt;/a&gt; in 1492, and &lt;a href=\"Vasco%20da%20Gama\"&gt;Vasco da Gama&lt;/a&gt; opened the ocean route to the &lt;a href=\"Orient\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt; linking the Atlantic and &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;s in 1498. The Portuguese-born explorer &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Magellan\"&gt;Ferdinand Magellan&lt;/a&gt; reached Asia westward across the Atlantic and the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;s in a Spanish expedition, resulting in the first &lt;a href=\"Timeline%20of%20Magellan%27s%20circumnavigation\"&gt;circumnavigation of the globe&lt;/a&gt;, completed by the Spaniard &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Elcano\"&gt;Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano&lt;/a&gt; (1519\u20131522). Soon after, the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing large global empires in the &lt;a href=\"Americas\"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;, Asia, Africa and Oceania. France, the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas and Asia. In 1588, a &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20armada\"&gt;Spanish armada&lt;/a&gt; failed to invade England. A year later &lt;a href=\"English%20Armada\"&gt;England tried unsuccessfully to invade Spain&lt;/a&gt;, allowing &lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Philip II of Spain&lt;/a&gt; to maintain his dominant war capacity in Europe. This English disaster also allowed the Spanish fleet to retain its capability to wage war for the next decades. However, two more Spanish armadas failed to invade England (&lt;a href=\"2nd%20Spanish%20Armada\"&gt;2nd Spanish Armada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Spanish%20Armada\"&gt;3rd Spanish Armada&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Church's power was further weakened by the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20reformation\"&gt;Protestant Reformation&lt;/a&gt; in 1517 when German theologian &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther\"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt; nailed his \"&lt;a href=\"Ninety-five%20Theses\"&gt;Ninety-five Theses&lt;/a&gt;\" criticising the selling of indulgences to the church door. He was subsequently excommunicated in the papal bull \"&lt;a href=\"Exsurge%20Domine\"&gt;Exsurge Domine&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1520 and his followers were condemned in the 1521 &lt;a href=\"Diet%20of%20Worms\"&gt;Diet of Worms&lt;/a&gt;, which divided German princes between &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; and Roman Catholic faiths. &lt;a href=\"European%20wars%20of%20religion\"&gt;Religious fighting and warfare&lt;/a&gt; spread with Protestantism. The plunder of the empires of the Americas allowed Spain to finance &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Inquisition\"&gt;religious persecution&lt;/a&gt; in Europe for over a century. The &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years War&lt;/a&gt; (1618\u20131648) crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of &lt;a href=\"Early%20Modern%20history%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population. In the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20of%20Westphalia\"&gt;Peace of Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;, France rose to predominance within Europe.\nThe 17th century in central and parts of eastern Europe was a period of general &lt;a href=\"The%20General%20Crisis\"&gt;decline&lt;/a&gt;; the region experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700. From the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Krewo\"&gt;Union of Krewo&lt;/a&gt; (1385) east-central Europe was dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Poland%20%281385%E2%80%931569%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Poland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"hegemony\"&gt;hegemony&lt;/a&gt; of the vast &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; had ended with the devastation brought by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Northern%20War\"&gt;Second Northern War&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Deluge\"&gt;Deluge&lt;/a&gt;) and subsequent conflicts; the state itself was &lt;a href=\"Partitions%20of%20Poland\"&gt;partitioned&lt;/a&gt; and ceased to exist at the end of the 18th century.\nFrom the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Horde\"&gt;Golden Horde&lt;/a&gt; were conquered by Russia, &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20Tatars\"&gt;Tatars&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20Khanate\"&gt;Crimean Khanate&lt;/a&gt; frequently &lt;a href=\"Crimean-Nogai%20raids%20into%20East%20Slavic%20lands\"&gt;raided&lt;/a&gt; Eastern Slavic lands to &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;capture slaves&lt;/a&gt;. Further east, the &lt;a href=\"Nogai%20Horde\"&gt;Nogai Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kazakh%20Khanate\"&gt;Kazakh Khanate&lt;/a&gt; frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of contemporary Russia and Ukraine for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia).\nThe Renaissance and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Monarchs\"&gt;New Monarchs&lt;/a&gt; marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention and scientific development. Among the great figures of the Western &lt;a href=\"scientific%20revolution\"&gt;scientific revolution&lt;/a&gt; of the 16th and 17th centuries were &lt;a href=\"Copernicus\"&gt;Copernicus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kepler\"&gt;Kepler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galileo\"&gt;Galileo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton\"&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/a&gt;. According to Peter Barrett, \"It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world.\"\n18th and 19th centuries.\nThe Age of Enlightenment was a powerful intellectual movement during the 18th century promoting scientific and reason-based thoughts. Discontent with the aristocracy and clergy's monopoly on political power in France resulted in the French Revolution, and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"French%20First%20Republic\"&gt;First Republic&lt;/a&gt; as a result of which the monarchy and many of the nobility perished during the initial &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Terror\"&gt;reign of terror&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt; rose to power in the aftermath of the French Revolution, and established the &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;First French Empire&lt;/a&gt; that, during the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt;, grew to encompass large parts of Europe before collapsing in 1815 with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Waterloo\"&gt;Battle of Waterloo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Empire\"&gt;Napoleonic rule&lt;/a&gt; resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the French Revolution, including that of the &lt;a href=\"nation%20state\"&gt;nation state&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the widespread adoption of the French models of &lt;a href=\"centralised%20government\"&gt;administration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20code\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20France\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, convened after Napoleon's downfall, established a new &lt;a href=\"balance%20of%20power%20%28international%20relations%29\"&gt;balance of power&lt;/a&gt; in Europe centred on the five \"&lt;a href=\"Great%20Power\"&gt;Great Power&lt;/a&gt;s\": the UK, France, &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and Russia. This balance would remain in place until the &lt;a href=\"Revolutions%20of%201848\"&gt;Revolutions of 1848&lt;/a&gt;, during which liberal uprisings affected all of Europe except for Russia and the UK. These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted. The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20empire\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian empire&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Ausgleich\"&gt;formed&lt;/a&gt;; 1871 saw the unifications of both &lt;a href=\"Italian%20unification\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unification%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; as nation-states from smaller principalities.\nIn parallel, the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Question\"&gt;Eastern Question&lt;/a&gt; grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281768%E2%80%931774%29\"&gt;Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)&lt;/a&gt;. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Power\"&gt;Great Power&lt;/a&gt;s struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg Empire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20revolution\"&gt;Serbian revolution&lt;/a&gt; (1804) and &lt;a href=\"Greek%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Greek War of Independence&lt;/a&gt; (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt;, which ended with the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20Wars\"&gt;Balkan Wars&lt;/a&gt; in 1912\u20131913. Formal recognition of the \"de facto\" independent principalities of &lt;a href=\"Montenegro\"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; ensued at the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;Congress of Berlin&lt;/a&gt; in 1878.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt; started in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout Europe. The invention and implementation of new technologies resulted in rapid urban growth, mass employment and the rise of a new working class. Reforms in social and economic spheres followed, including the &lt;a href=\"Factory%20Acts\"&gt;first laws&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"child%20labour\"&gt;child labour&lt;/a&gt;, the legalisation of &lt;a href=\"trade%20union\"&gt;trade union&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;abolition of slavery&lt;/a&gt;. In Britain, the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Health%20Act%20of%201875\"&gt;Public Health Act of 1875&lt;/a&gt; was passed, which significantly improved living conditions in many British cities. Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900. The last major famine recorded in Western Europe, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Great Famine of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, caused death and mass emigration of millions of Irish people. In the 19th century, 70\u00a0million people left Europe in migrations to various European colonies abroad and to the United States. Demographic growth meant that, by 1900, Europe's share of the world's population was 25%.\n20th century to the present.\nTwo world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. World War I was fought between 1914 and 1918. It started when &lt;a href=\"Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20nationalism\"&gt;Yugoslav nationalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gavrilo%20Princip\"&gt;Gavrilo Princip&lt;/a&gt;. Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the &lt;a href=\"Entente%20Powers\"&gt;Entente Powers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"French%20Third%20Republic\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, Portugal, &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, the United Kingdom, and later &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and the United States) and the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Powers\"&gt;Central Powers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;). The war left more than 16\u00a0million civilians and military dead. Over 60\u00a0million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918.\nRussia was plunged into the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;Russian Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, which threw down the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Tsarist monarchy&lt;/a&gt; and replaced it with the &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, leading also to the independence of many former &lt;a href=\"Governorate%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Russian governorates&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;, as new European countries. &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt;, which officially ended World War I in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions. Excess deaths in Russia over the course of World War I and the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Russian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; (including the postwar &lt;a href=\"Russian%20famine%20of%201921\"&gt;famine&lt;/a&gt;) amounted to a combined total of 18 million. In 1932\u20131933, under &lt;a href=\"Stalin\"&gt;Stalin&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20famine%20of%201932-1933\"&gt;second Soviet famine&lt;/a&gt; which caused millions of deaths; surviving &lt;a href=\"kulak\"&gt;kulak&lt;/a&gt;s were persecuted and many sent to &lt;a href=\"Gulag\"&gt;Gulag&lt;/a&gt;s to do &lt;a href=\"Unfree%20labour\"&gt;forced labour&lt;/a&gt;. Stalin was also responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Purge\"&gt;Great Purge&lt;/a&gt; of 1937\u201338 in which the &lt;a href=\"NKVD\"&gt;NKVD&lt;/a&gt; executed 681,692 people; millions of people were &lt;a href=\"population%20transfer%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;deported and exiled&lt;/a&gt; to remote areas of the Soviet Union.\nThe &lt;a href=\"social%20revolution\"&gt;social revolution&lt;/a&gt;s sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20War\"&gt;The Great War&lt;/a&gt;: in 1919, with the &lt;a href=\"Weimar%20Republic\"&gt;Weimar Republic&lt;/a&gt; in Germany and the &lt;a href=\"First%20Austrian%20Republic\"&gt;First Austrian Republic&lt;/a&gt;; in 1922, with &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Mussolini\"&gt;Mussolini&lt;/a&gt;'s one-party &lt;a href=\"Fascism\"&gt;fascist&lt;/a&gt; government in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Kingdom of Italy&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Atat%C3%BCrk\"&gt;Atat\u00fcrk&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkish Republic&lt;/a&gt;, adopting the Western alphabet and state &lt;a href=\"secularism\"&gt;secularism&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This, and the &lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929\"&gt;Wall Street Crash of 1929&lt;/a&gt;, brought about the worldwide &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, &lt;a href=\"Fascism\"&gt;fascist movements&lt;/a&gt; developed throughout Europe placing &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt; in power of what became &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the &lt;a href=\"Saarland\"&gt;Saarland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhineland\"&gt;Rhineland&lt;/a&gt; in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; became a part of Germany following the &lt;a href=\"Anschluss\"&gt;Anschluss&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year, following the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20Agreement\"&gt;Munich Agreement&lt;/a&gt; signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the &lt;a href=\"Sudetenland\"&gt;Sudetenland&lt;/a&gt;, which was a part of &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate%20of%20Bohemia%20and%20Moravia\"&gt;Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia&lt;/a&gt;, controlled by Germany and the &lt;a href=\"Slovak%20Republic%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;Slovak Republic&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of &lt;a href=\"appeasement\"&gt;appeasement&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith tensions mounting between Germany and &lt;a href=\"Second%20Polish%20Republic\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; over the future of &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Danzig&lt;/a&gt;, the Germans turned to the Soviets and signed the &lt;a href=\"Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact\"&gt;Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Poland\"&gt;invaded Poland&lt;/a&gt; on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the &lt;a href=\"European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;European Theatre of World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Soviet invasion of Poland&lt;/a&gt; started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20occupation%20of%20the%20Baltic%20states%20%281940%29\"&gt;Baltic countries&lt;/a&gt; and, on November 30, Finland, the latter of which was followed by the devastating &lt;a href=\"Winter%20War\"&gt;Winter War&lt;/a&gt; for the Red Army. The British hoped to land at &lt;a href=\"Battles%20of%20Narvik\"&gt;Narvik&lt;/a&gt; and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The &lt;a href=\"Phoney%20War\"&gt;Phoney War&lt;/a&gt; continued.\nIn May 1940, Germany &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20France\"&gt;attacked France&lt;/a&gt; through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August, Germany began a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Britain\"&gt;bombing offensive on Britain&lt;/a&gt;, but failed to convince the Britons to give up. In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Barbarossa\"&gt;Operation Barbarossa&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 December 1941 &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;attack on Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;allied&lt;/a&gt; forces. \nAfter the staggering &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stalingrad\"&gt;Battle of Stalingrad&lt;/a&gt; in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kursk\"&gt;Battle of Kursk&lt;/a&gt;, which involved the largest &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Prokhorovka\"&gt;tank battle&lt;/a&gt; in history, was the last major German offensive on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt;. In June 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the &lt;a href=\"Normandy%20landings\"&gt;D-Day landings&lt;/a&gt;, opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;fell in 1945&lt;/a&gt;, ending World War II in Europe. The war was the largest and most destructive in human history, with &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II%20casualties\"&gt;60\u00a0million dead across the world&lt;/a&gt;. More than 40\u00a0million people in Europe had died as a result of World War II, including between 11 and 17\u00a0million people who perished during &lt;a href=\"the%20Holocaust\"&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;. The Soviet Union &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II%20casualties%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;lost around 27\u00a0million people&lt;/a&gt; (mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all World War II casualties. By the end of World War II, Europe had more than 40\u00a0million &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s. Several &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II%20evacuation%20and%20expulsion\"&gt;post-war expulsions&lt;/a&gt; in Central and Eastern Europe displaced a total of about 20\u00a0million people, in particular, &lt;a href=\"Flight%20and%20expulsion%20of%20Germans%20%281944%E2%80%931950%29\"&gt;German-speakers from all over Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld War I, and especially World War II, diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the &lt;a href=\"Yalta%20Conference\"&gt;Yalta Conference&lt;/a&gt; and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Churchill\"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt; an \"&lt;a href=\"Iron%20Curtain\"&gt;Iron Curtain&lt;/a&gt;\". The United States and Western Europe established the &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; alliance and, later, the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt;. Particular hot spots after the Second World War were &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt;, whereby the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Territory%20of%20Trieste\"&gt;Free Territory of Trieste&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1947 with the UN, was dissolved in 1954 and 1975, respectively. The &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20blockade\"&gt;Berlin blockade&lt;/a&gt; in 1948 and 1949 and the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Wall\"&gt;Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt; in 1961 were one of the great international crises of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe two new &lt;a href=\"superpower\"&gt;superpower&lt;/a&gt;s, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20proliferation\"&gt;nuclear proliferation&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time &lt;a href=\"decolonisation\"&gt;decolonisation&lt;/a&gt;, which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.\nIn the 1980s the &lt;a href=\"glasnost\"&gt;reforms&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Gorbachev\"&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29\"&gt;Solidarity&lt;/a&gt; movement in Poland weakened the previously rigid communist system. The opening of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Curtain\"&gt;Iron Curtain&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Pan-European%20Picnic\"&gt;Pan-European Picnic&lt;/a&gt; then set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20bloc\"&gt;Eastern bloc&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communism&lt;/a&gt; collapsed, and the Cold War ended. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Wall%23Fall%20of%20the%20Wall\"&gt;fall of the Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt; in 1989 and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more. This made old previously interrupted cultural and economic relationships possible, and previously isolated cities such as &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; were now again in the centre of Europe.\n&lt;a href=\"European%20integration\"&gt;European integration&lt;/a&gt; also grew after World War II. In 1949 the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; was founded, following a speech by Sir &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Churchill\"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt;, with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. It includes all European states except for &lt;a href=\"Belarus\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20City\"&gt;Vatican City&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Rome\"&gt;Treaty of Rome&lt;/a&gt; in 1957 established the &lt;a href=\"European%20Economic%20Community\"&gt;European Economic Community&lt;/a&gt; between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market. In 1967 the EEC, &lt;a href=\"European%20Coal%20and%20Steel%20Community\"&gt;European Coal and Steel Community&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Euratom\"&gt;Euratom&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"European%20Community\"&gt;European Community&lt;/a&gt;, which in 1993 became the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. The EU established a &lt;a href=\"European%20Parliament\"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"European%20Court%20of%20Justice\"&gt;court&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20Central%20Bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt;, and introduced the &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; as a unified currency. Between 2004 and 2013, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, &lt;a href=\"Enlargement%20of%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;expanding the EU&lt;/a&gt; to 28 European countries and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power. However, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020, as a result of a &lt;a href=\"2016%20United%20Kingdom%20European%20Union%20membership%20referendum\"&gt;June 2016 referendum on EU membership&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nEurope makes up the western fifth of the &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt;n landmass. It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent. Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas to the south.\nLand relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high &lt;a href=\"Alps\"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyrenees\"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carpathians\"&gt;Carpathians&lt;/a&gt;, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20European%20Plain\"&gt;Great European Plain&lt;/a&gt; and at its heart lies the &lt;a href=\"North%20German%20Plain\"&gt;North German Plain&lt;/a&gt;. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, &lt;a href=\"fjord\"&gt;fjord&lt;/a&gt;-cut spine of Norway.\nThis description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Italian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, Britain and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until &lt;a href=\"sea%20level%20rise\"&gt;rising sea levels&lt;/a&gt; cut them off.\nClimate.\nEurope lies mainly in the &lt;a href=\"temperate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; climate zones, being subjected to &lt;a href=\"prevailing%20westerlies\"&gt;prevailing westerlies&lt;/a&gt;. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Stream\"&gt;Gulf Stream&lt;/a&gt;. The Gulf Stream is nicknamed \"Europe's central heating\", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.\nTherefore, the average temperature throughout the year of &lt;a href=\"Aveiro%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Aveiro&lt;/a&gt; is , while it is only in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; which is almost on the same latitude, bordering the same ocean. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in far south-eastern Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around higher than those in Calgary and they are almost higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.\nThe large water masses of the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, which equalise the temperatures on an annual and daily average, are also of particular importance. The water of the Mediterranean extends from the &lt;a href=\"Sahara%20desert\"&gt;Sahara desert&lt;/a&gt; to the Alpine arc in its northernmost part of the &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn general, Europe is not just colder towards the north compared to the south, but it also gets colder from the west towards the east. The climate is more oceanic in the west and less so in the east. This can be illustrated by the following table of average temperatures at locations roughly following the 64th, 60th, 55th, 50th, 45th and 40th &lt;a href=\"latitudes\"&gt;latitudes&lt;/a&gt;. None of them is located at high altitude; most of them are close to the sea. (location, approximate latitude and longitude, coldest month average, hottest month average and annual average temperatures in degrees C)\nIt is notable how the average temperatures for the coldest month, as well as the annual average temperatures, drop from the west to the east. For instance, Edinburgh is warmer than Belgrade during the coldest month of the year, although Belgrade is around 10\u00b0 of latitude farther south.\nGeology.\nThe geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Shield\"&gt;Baltic Shield&lt;/a&gt; (Fennoscandia) and the &lt;a href=\"Sarmatian%20craton\"&gt;Sarmatian craton&lt;/a&gt;, both around 2.25\u00a0billion years ago, followed by the &lt;a href=\"Volgo%E2%80%93Uralia\"&gt;Volgo\u2013Uralia&lt;/a&gt; shield, the three together leading to the &lt;a href=\"East%20European%20craton\"&gt;East European craton&lt;/a&gt; (\u2248 &lt;a href=\"Baltica\"&gt;Baltica&lt;/a&gt;) which became a part of the &lt;a href=\"supercontinent\"&gt;supercontinent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20%28supercontinent%29\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. Around 1.1\u00a0billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the &lt;a href=\"Laurentia\"&gt;Laurentia&lt;/a&gt; block) became joined to &lt;a href=\"Rodinia\"&gt;Rodinia&lt;/a&gt;, later resplitting around 550\u00a0million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440\u00a0million years ago &lt;a href=\"Euramerica\"&gt;Euramerica&lt;/a&gt; was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with &lt;a href=\"Gondwana\"&gt;Gondwana&lt;/a&gt; then leading to the formation of &lt;a href=\"Pangea\"&gt;Pangea&lt;/a&gt;. Around 190\u00a0million years ago, Gondwana and &lt;a href=\"Laurasia\"&gt;Laurasia&lt;/a&gt; split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50\u00a0million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the &lt;a href=\"late%20Tertiary\"&gt;late Tertiary&lt;/a&gt; period about five million years ago.\nThe geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Highlands\"&gt;Scottish Highlands&lt;/a&gt; to the rolling &lt;a href=\"plain\"&gt;plain&lt;/a&gt;s of Hungary. Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Europe\"&gt;Southern Europe&lt;/a&gt; and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20Mountains\"&gt;Ural Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the &lt;a href=\"Pyrenees\"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alps\"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Carpathian%20Mountains\"&gt;Carpathians&lt;/a&gt;. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the &lt;a href=\"Scandinavian%20Mountains\"&gt;Scandinavian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Sea\"&gt;Celtic Sea&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; complex and &lt;a href=\"Barents%20Sea\"&gt;Barents Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe northern plain contains the old geological continent of &lt;a href=\"Baltica\"&gt;Baltica&lt;/a&gt; and so may be regarded geologically as the \"main continent\", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient &lt;a href=\"microcontinent\"&gt;microcontinent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Avalonia\"&gt;Avalonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlora.\nHaving lived side by side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of &lt;a href=\"Fennoscandia\"&gt;Fennoscandia&lt;/a&gt; and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various &lt;a href=\"national%20park\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Stream\"&gt;Gulf Stream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Atlantic%20Current\"&gt;North Atlantic Drift&lt;/a&gt; warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these (&lt;a href=\"Alps\"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyrenees\"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt;) are oriented east\u2013west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south\u2013north (&lt;a href=\"Scandinavian%20Mountains\"&gt;Scandinavian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dinaric%20Alps\"&gt;Dinarides&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carpathian%20Mountains\"&gt;Carpathians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apennine%20Mountains\"&gt;Apennines&lt;/a&gt;) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; at some point in time and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.\nPossibly 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest. It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of &lt;a href=\"deforestation\"&gt;deforestation&lt;/a&gt;, Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the &lt;a href=\"Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forest\"&gt;broadleaf and mixed&lt;/a&gt; forests, &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt; of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed &lt;a href=\"rainforest\"&gt;rainforest&lt;/a&gt;s of the Caucasus and the &lt;a href=\"Cork%20oak\"&gt;Cork oak&lt;/a&gt; forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture &lt;a href=\"plantation\"&gt;plantation&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Pinophyta\"&gt;conifers&lt;/a&gt; have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2\u20133% or less, while in its Western Russia its 5\u201310%. The &lt;a href=\"European%20countries%20by%20forest%20area\"&gt;European country with the smallest percentage of forested area&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).\nIn temperate Europe, mixed forest with both &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;broadleaf&lt;/a&gt; and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are &lt;a href=\"beech\"&gt;beech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;. In the north, the taiga is a mixed &lt;a href=\"spruce\"&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"pine\"&gt;pine&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"birch\"&gt;birch&lt;/a&gt; forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to &lt;a href=\"tundra\"&gt;tundra&lt;/a&gt; as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many &lt;a href=\"olive\"&gt;olive&lt;/a&gt; trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; &lt;a href=\"Cupressus%20sempervirens\"&gt;Mediterranean Cypress&lt;/a&gt; is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east\u2013west tongue of Eurasian &lt;a href=\"grassland\"&gt;grassland&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"steppe\"&gt;steppe&lt;/a&gt;) extends westwards from &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.\nFauna.\nGlaciation during the &lt;a href=\"Quaternary%20glaciation\"&gt;most recent ice age&lt;/a&gt; and the presence of man affected the distribution of &lt;a href=\"Fauna%20of%20Europe\"&gt;European fauna&lt;/a&gt;. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top &lt;a href=\"predator\"&gt;predator&lt;/a&gt; species have been hunted to extinction. The &lt;a href=\"woolly%20mammoth\"&gt;woolly mammoth&lt;/a&gt; was extinct before the end of the &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; period. Today &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"carnivore\"&gt;carnivore&lt;/a&gt;s) and &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"omnivore\"&gt;omnivore&lt;/a&gt;s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the &lt;a href=\"European%20brown%20bear\"&gt;brown bear&lt;/a&gt; lives primarily in the &lt;a href=\"Balkan\"&gt;Balkan peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, Scandinavia and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s may be found on &lt;a href=\"Svalbard\"&gt;Svalbard&lt;/a&gt;, a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in &lt;a href=\"Central%20and%20Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Central and Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Europe\"&gt;Western Europe&lt;/a&gt; (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).\nEuropean wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).\nImportant European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the &lt;a href=\"small%20tortoiseshell\"&gt;small tortoiseshell&lt;/a&gt; butterfly, add to the biodiversity.\nThe extinction of the &lt;a href=\"Cretan%20Dwarf%20Hippopotamus\"&gt;dwarf hippos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dwarf%20elephant\"&gt;dwarf elephant&lt;/a&gt;s has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;.\nSea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly &lt;a href=\"phytoplankton\"&gt;phytoplankton&lt;/a&gt;. Important animals that live in European seas are &lt;a href=\"zooplankton\"&gt;zooplankton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mollusc\"&gt;mollusc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"echinoderm\"&gt;echinoderm&lt;/a&gt;s, different &lt;a href=\"crustacean\"&gt;crustacean&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"octopuses\"&gt;octopuses&lt;/a&gt;, fish, &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"whales\"&gt;whales&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's &lt;a href=\"Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20European%20Wildlife%20and%20Natural%20Habitats\"&gt;Bern Convention&lt;/a&gt;, which has also been signed by the &lt;a href=\"European%20Community\"&gt;European Community&lt;/a&gt; as well as non-European states.\nPolitics.\nThe political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt; in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20democracy\"&gt;parliamentary democracy&lt;/a&gt;, in most cases in the form of &lt;a href=\"Republic\"&gt;Republic&lt;/a&gt;; in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the &lt;a href=\"Monarchies%20in%20Europe\"&gt;Monarchy&lt;/a&gt;. Europe's remaining eleven monarchies are &lt;a href=\"constitutional%20monarchy\"&gt;constitutional&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"European%20integration\"&gt;European integration&lt;/a&gt; is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; since the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20Economic%20Union\"&gt;Eurasian Economic Union&lt;/a&gt; has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.\n27 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free &lt;a href=\"Schengen%20Area\"&gt;Schengen Area&lt;/a&gt; and 19 of the monetary union &lt;a href=\"Eurozone\"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt;. Among the smaller European organisations are the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Council\"&gt;Nordic Council&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benelux\"&gt;Benelux&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Assembly\"&gt;Baltic Assembly&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Visegr%C3%A1d%20Group\"&gt;Visegr\u00e1d Group&lt;/a&gt;.\nList of states and territories.\nThe list below includes all entities falling even partially under any of the &lt;a href=\"Geopolitical%20divisions%20of%20Europe\"&gt;various common definitions of Europe&lt;/a&gt;, geographic or political.\nWithin the above-mentioned states are several &lt;a href=\"de%20facto\"&gt;de facto&lt;/a&gt; independent countries with &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20states%20with%20limited%20recognition\"&gt;limited to no international recognition&lt;/a&gt;. None of them are members of the UN:\nSeveral dependencies and similar territories with broad autonomy are also found within or in close proximity to Europe. This includes \u00c5land (a &lt;a href=\"region%20of%20Finland\"&gt;region of Finland&lt;/a&gt;), two constituent countries of the Kingdom of Denmark (other than Denmark itself), three &lt;a href=\"Crown%20dependencies\"&gt;Crown dependencies&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"British%20Overseas%20Territories\"&gt;British Overseas Territories&lt;/a&gt;. Svalbard is also included due to its unique status within Norway, although it is not autonomous. Not included are the three &lt;a href=\"countries%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;countries of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; with devolved powers and the two &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20Regions%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Autonomous Regions of Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, which despite having a unique degree of autonomy, are not largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. Areas with little more than a unique tax status, such as &lt;a href=\"Heligoland\"&gt;Heligoland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Canary%20Islands\"&gt;Canary Islands&lt;/a&gt;, are also not included for this reason.\nEconomy.\nAs a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7\u00a0trillion compared to North America's $27.1\u00a0trillion in 2008. In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak. As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Europe\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central Europe&lt;/a&gt;ans, while some of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; economies are still emerging from the &lt;a href=\"collapse%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;collapse of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"breakup%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;breakup of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe model of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Banana\"&gt;Blue Banana&lt;/a&gt; was designed as an economic geographic representation of the respective economic power of the regions, which was further developed into the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Banana\"&gt;Golden Banana&lt;/a&gt; or Blue Star. The trade between East and West, as well as towards Asia, which had been disrupted for a long time by the two world wars, new borders and the Cold War, increased sharply after 1989. In addition, there is new impetus from the Chinese &lt;a href=\"Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative\"&gt;Belt and Road Initiative&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Suez%20Canal\"&gt;Suez Canal&lt;/a&gt; towards Africa and Asia.\nThe European Union, a political entity composed of 27 European states, comprises the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28nominal%29\"&gt;largest single economic area&lt;/a&gt; in the world. Nineteen EU &lt;a href=\"Eurozone\"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt; share the &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; as a common currency.\nFive European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28PPP%29\"&gt;national economies in GDP (PPP)&lt;/a&gt;. This includes (ranks according to the &lt;a href=\"The%20World%20Factbook\"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;): Germany (6), Russia (7), the United Kingdom (10), France (11) and Italy (13).\nThere is huge disparity between many European countries in terms of their income. The richest in terms of nominal GDP is &lt;a href=\"Monaco\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt; with its US$185,829 per capita (2018) and the poorest is &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; with its US$3,659 per capita (2019). Monaco is the richest country in terms of GDP per capita in the world according to the World Bank report.\nAs a whole, Europe's GDP per capita is US$21,767 according to a 2016 International Monetary Fund assessment.\nEconomic history.\nCapitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism. From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe. The &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt; started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century, and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by World War I but by the beginning of World War II they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. World War II, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.\nAfter World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin, and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades. Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany &lt;a href=\"Wirtschaftswunder\"&gt;recovered quickly&lt;/a&gt; and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s. France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Franco\"&gt;Franco&lt;/a&gt;, also recovered and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20miracle\"&gt;Spanish miracle&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of &lt;a href=\"Central%20and%20Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Central and Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;an states came under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and thus were members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20for%20Mutual%20Economic%20Assistance\"&gt;Council for Mutual Economic Assistance&lt;/a&gt; (COMECON).\nThe states which retained a &lt;a href=\"free-market\"&gt;free-market&lt;/a&gt; system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Plan\"&gt;Marshall Plan&lt;/a&gt;. The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;. Until 1990, the &lt;a href=\"European%20Community\"&gt;European Community&lt;/a&gt; was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.\nWith the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states began free market reforms.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt; and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.\nBy the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the &lt;a href=\"Eurozone\"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt; replacing their former national currencies by the common euro. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden. The European Union is now the largest economy in the world.\nFigures released by &lt;a href=\"Eurostat\"&gt;Eurostat&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 confirmed that the Eurozone had gone into &lt;a href=\"Late%202000s%20recession%20in%20Europe\"&gt;recession&lt;/a&gt; in 2008. It impacted much of the region. In 2010, fears of a &lt;a href=\"European%20sovereign-debt%20crisis\"&gt;sovereign debt crisis&lt;/a&gt; developed concerning some countries in Europe, especially Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. As a result, measures were taken, especially for Greece, by the leading countries of the Eurozone. The &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;EU-27&lt;/a&gt; unemployment rate was 10.3% in 2012. For those aged 15\u201324 it was 22.4%.\nDemographics.\nIn 2017, the population of Europe was estimated to be 742 million according to , which is slightly more than one-ninth of the world's population.\nA century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the &lt;a href=\"world%20population\"&gt;world's population&lt;/a&gt;. The population of Europe has grown in the past century, but in other areas of the world (in particular Africa and Asia) the population has grown far more quickly. Among the continents, Europe has a relatively high &lt;a href=\"population%20density\"&gt;population density&lt;/a&gt;, second only to Asia. Most of Europe is in a mode of &lt;a href=\"Sub-replacement%20fertility\"&gt;Sub-replacement fertility&lt;/a&gt;, which means that each new(-born) generation is being less populous than the older.\nThe most densely populated country in Europe (and in the world) is the &lt;a href=\"microstate\"&gt;microstate&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Monaco\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;.\nEthnic groups.\nPan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct \"peoples of Europe\", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute &lt;a href=\"ethnic%20minority\"&gt;ethnic minorities&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to UN population projection, Europe's population may fall to about 7% of world population by 2050, or 653\u00a0million people (medium variant, 556 to 777\u00a0million in low and high variants, respectively). Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to &lt;a href=\"fertility%20rates\"&gt;fertility rates&lt;/a&gt;. The average number of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20and%20territories%20by%20fertility%20rate\"&gt;children per female&lt;/a&gt; of child-bearing age is 1.52. According to some sources, this rate is higher among &lt;a href=\"Islam%20in%20Europe\"&gt;Muslims in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The UN predicts a steady &lt;a href=\"population%20decline\"&gt;population decline&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Central%20and%20Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Central and Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; as a result of emigration and low birth rates.\nMigration.\nEurope is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at 70.6 million people, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Organisation%20for%20Migration\"&gt;IOM&lt;/a&gt;'s report said. In 2005, the EU had an overall net gain from &lt;a href=\"immigration\"&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt; of 1.8\u00a0million people. This accounted for almost 85% of Europe's total &lt;a href=\"population%20growth\"&gt;population growth&lt;/a&gt;. In 2008, 696,000 persons were given citizenship of an EU27 member state, a decrease from 707,000 the previous year. In 2017, approximately 825,000 persons acquired &lt;a href=\"Citizenship%20of%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;citizenship&lt;/a&gt; of an EU28 member state. 2.4 million immigrants from non-EU countries entered the EU in 2017.\nEarly modern &lt;a href=\"emigration%20from%20Europe\"&gt;emigration from Europe&lt;/a&gt; began with Spanish and Portuguese settlers in the 16th century, and French and English settlers in the 17th century. But numbers remained relatively small until waves of mass emigration in the 19th century, when millions of poor families left Europe.\nToday, &lt;a href=\"European%20diaspora\"&gt;large populations of European descent&lt;/a&gt; are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in &lt;a href=\"Uruguay\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, while most of the other &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;n countries also have a considerable &lt;a href=\"White%20Latin%20American\"&gt;population of European origins&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have large European-derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Verde\"&gt;Cape Verde&lt;/a&gt; and probably &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Tom%C3%A9%20and%20Pr%C3%ADncipe\"&gt;S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe&lt;/a&gt;, depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the &lt;a href=\"White%20South%20Africans\"&gt;White South Africans&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. In Asia, European-derived populations, (specifically &lt;a href=\"Russians\"&gt;Russians&lt;/a&gt;), predominate in &lt;a href=\"North%20Asia\"&gt;North Asia&lt;/a&gt; and some parts of Northern &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;.\nLanguages.\nEurope has about 225 indigenous languages, mostly falling within three &lt;a href=\"Indo-European%20languages\"&gt;Indo-European&lt;/a&gt; language groups: the &lt;a href=\"Romance%20languages\"&gt;Romance languages&lt;/a&gt;, derived from the &lt;a href=\"Latin%20language\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20languages\"&gt;Germanic languages&lt;/a&gt;, whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20languages\"&gt;Slavic languages&lt;/a&gt;. Slavic languages are mostly spoken in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in Western and Southern Europe, as well as in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; in Central Europe and &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moldova\"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt; in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Western, Northern and Central Europe as well as in &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; in Southern Europe. Languages in adjacent areas show significant overlaps (such as in &lt;a href=\"English%20%28language%29\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, for example). Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20languages\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt; group (&lt;a href=\"Latvian%20language\"&gt;Latvian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20language\"&gt;Lithuanian&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20languages\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; group (&lt;a href=\"Irish%20language\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scots%20Gaelic%20language\"&gt;Scottish Gaelic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manx%20language\"&gt;Manx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cornish%20language\"&gt;Cornish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breton%20language\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20language\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20language\"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt;.\nA distinct non-Indo-European family of &lt;a href=\"Uralic%20languages\"&gt;Uralic languages&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Estonian%20language\"&gt;Estonian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20language\"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20language\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erzya%20language\"&gt;Erzya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Komi%20language\"&gt;Komi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mari%20language\"&gt;Mari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moksha%20language\"&gt;Moksha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Udmurt%20language\"&gt;Udmurt&lt;/a&gt;) is spoken mainly in &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and parts of Russia. &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20languages\"&gt;Turkic languages&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijani%20language\"&gt;Azerbaijani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kazakh%20language\"&gt;Kazakh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe (&lt;a href=\"Balkan%20Gagauz%20Turkish\"&gt;Balkan Gagauz Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bashkir%20language\"&gt;Bashkir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chuvash%20language\"&gt;Chuvash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20Tatar%20language\"&gt;Crimean Tatar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karachay-Balkar%20language\"&gt;Karachay-Balkar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kumyk%20language\"&gt;Kumyk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nogai%20language\"&gt;Nogai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tatar%20language\"&gt;Tatar&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Kartvelian%20languages\"&gt;Kartvelian languages&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Georgian%20language\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mingrelian%20language\"&gt;Mingrelian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Svan%20language\"&gt;Svan&lt;/a&gt;) are spoken primarily in &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. Two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Caucasian%20languages\"&gt;Northeast Caucasian&lt;/a&gt;, most notably including &lt;a href=\"Chechen%20language\"&gt;Chechen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avar%20language\"&gt;Avar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lezgian%20language\"&gt;Lezgin&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Caucasian%20languages\"&gt;Northwest Caucasian&lt;/a&gt;, most notably including &lt;a href=\"Adyghe%20language\"&gt;Adyghe&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Maltese%20language\"&gt;Maltese&lt;/a&gt; is the only &lt;a href=\"Semitic%20language\"&gt;Semitic language&lt;/a&gt; that is official within the EU, while &lt;a href=\"Basque%20language\"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; is the only European &lt;a href=\"language%20isolate\"&gt;language isolate&lt;/a&gt;.\nMultilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Framework%20Convention%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20National%20Minorities\"&gt;Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities&lt;/a&gt; and the Council of Europe's &lt;a href=\"European%20Charter%20for%20Regional%20or%20Minority%20Languages\"&gt;European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages&lt;/a&gt; set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.\nMajor cities and urban areas.\nThe four largest &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20urban%20areas%20in%20Europe\"&gt;urban areas of Europe&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. All have over 10 million residents, and as such have been described as &lt;a href=\"megacity\"&gt;megacities&lt;/a&gt;. While Istanbul has the highest total city population, it lies partly in Asia, making Moscow the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20European%20cities%20by%20population%20within%20city%20limits\"&gt;largest city entirely in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next largest cities in order of population are &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, each having over 3 million residents.\nWhen considering the commuter belts or &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20metropolitan%20areas%20in%20Europe\"&gt;metropolitan areas&lt;/a&gt;, within the EU (for which comparable data is available) Moscow covers the largest population, followed in order by Istanbul, London, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Ruhr Area, Saint Petersburg, Rhein-S\u00fcd, Barcelona and Berlin.\nCulture.\n\"Europe\" as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Greece\"&gt;ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and its cultures. The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of &lt;a href=\"Christendom\"&gt;Christendom&lt;/a&gt; (or more specifically &lt;a href=\"Latin%20Christendom\"&gt;Latin Christendom&lt;/a&gt;), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20conquests\"&gt;against Islam&lt;/a&gt;, as in the &lt;a href=\"Reconquista\"&gt;Reconquista&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20wars%20in%20Europe\"&gt;Ottoman wars in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20Europe\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romance-speaking%20Europe\"&gt;Latin (Romance)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20Europe\"&gt;Germanic&lt;/a&gt;, but with several components not part of either of these group (notably &lt;a href=\"Greek%20culture\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Basque%20culture\"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Europe\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt;). Historically, special examples with overlapping cultures are &lt;a href=\"Strasbourg\"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt; with Latin (Romance) and Germanic or &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; with Latin, Slavic and Germanic roots.\nCultural contacts and mixtures shape a large part of the regional cultures of Europe. It is often described as \"maximum cultural diversity with minimal geographical distances\".\nDifferent cultural events are organised in Europe, with the aim of bringing different cultures closer together and raising awareness of their importance, such as the &lt;a href=\"European%20Capital%20of%20Culture\"&gt;European Capital of Culture&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"European%20Region%20of%20Gastronomy\"&gt;European Region of Gastronomy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"European%20Youth%20Capital\"&gt;European Youth Capital&lt;/a&gt; and the European Capital of Sport.\nReligion.\n&lt;a href=\"history%20of%20religion\"&gt;Historically&lt;/a&gt;, religion in Europe has been a major influence on &lt;a href=\"Western%20art%20history\"&gt;European art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"culture%20of%20Europe\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Western%20philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20Union%20law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;. There are six patron saints of Europe venerated in Roman Catholicism, five of them so declared by Pope John Paul II between 1980 and 1999: Saints Cyril and Methodius, Saint Bridget of Sweden, Catherine of Siena and Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross (Edith Stein). The exception is Benedict of Nursia, who had already been declared \"Patron Saint of all Europe\" by Pope Paul VI in 1964.The largest religion in Europe is &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; denominations. Among Protestants, the most popular are historically state-supported European denominations such as &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutheranism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anglicanism\"&gt;Anglicanism&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Reformed%20faith\"&gt;Reformed faith&lt;/a&gt;. Other Protestant denominations such as historically significant ones like &lt;a href=\"Anabaptists\"&gt;Anabaptists&lt;/a&gt; were never supported by any state and thus are not so widespread, as well as these newly arriving from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Pentecostalism\"&gt;Pentecostalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adventism\"&gt;Adventism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Methodism\"&gt;Methodism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baptists\"&gt;Baptists&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Protestants\"&gt;Evangelical Protestants&lt;/a&gt;; although Methodism and Baptists both have European origins. The notion of \"Europe\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Western%20World\"&gt;Western World&lt;/a&gt;\" has been intimately connected with the concept of \"&lt;a href=\"Christendom\"&gt;Christianity and Christendom&lt;/a&gt;\"; many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified &lt;a href=\"European%20identity\"&gt;European identity&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistorically, Europe has been the centre and \"cradle of &lt;a href=\"Christian%20civilization\"&gt;Christian civilisation&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, including the Roman &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, has played a prominent role in the shaping of &lt;a href=\"Western%20civilisation\"&gt;Western civilisation&lt;/a&gt; since at least the 4th century, and for at least a millennium and a half, Europe has been nearly equivalent to &lt;a href=\"Christian%20culture\"&gt;Christian culture&lt;/a&gt;, even though the religion was inherited from the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Christian%20culture\"&gt;Christian culture&lt;/a&gt; was the predominant force in &lt;a href=\"western%20civilisation\"&gt;western civilisation&lt;/a&gt;, guiding the course of &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"art\"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012 Europe had the &lt;a href=\"Christianity%20by%20country\"&gt;world's largest Christian population&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second most popular religion is &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; (6%) concentrated mainly in the Balkans and Eastern Europe (&lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TRNC\"&gt;North Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Caucasus\"&gt;North Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Idel-Ural\"&gt;Volga-Ural region&lt;/a&gt;). Other religions, including Judaism, &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Kalmykia\"&gt;Republic of Kalmykia&lt;/a&gt;). The 20th century saw the revival of &lt;a href=\"Neopaganism\"&gt;Neopaganism&lt;/a&gt; through movements such as &lt;a href=\"Wicca\"&gt;Wicca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Druidry\"&gt;Druidry&lt;/a&gt;.\nEurope has become a relatively &lt;a href=\"secular\"&gt;secular&lt;/a&gt; continent, with an increasing number and proportion of &lt;a href=\"irreligion\"&gt;irreligious&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"atheism\"&gt;atheist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"agnosticism\"&gt;agnostic&lt;/a&gt; people, who make up about 18.2% of Europe's population, currently the largest secular population in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20religion\"&gt;Western world&lt;/a&gt;. There are a particularly high number of self-described non-religious people in the Czech Republic, &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden, former East Germany and France.\nExternal links.\nHistorical Maps"
