    "text": "The Battle of Fort Dearborn (sometimes called the Fort Dearborn Massacre) was an engagement between &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; troops and &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt; Native Americans that occurred on August 15, 1812, near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dearborn\"&gt;Fort Dearborn&lt;/a&gt; in what is now &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, Illinois (at that time, wilderness in the &lt;a href=\"Illinois%20Territory\"&gt;Illinois Territory&lt;/a&gt;). The battle, which occurred during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt;, followed the evacuation of the fort as ordered by the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Northwest%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;United States Army of the Northwest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Hull\"&gt;William Hull&lt;/a&gt;. The battle lasted about 15 minutes and resulted in a complete victory for the Native Americans. After the battle, Fort Dearborn was burned down. Some of the soldiers and settlers who had been taken captive were later ransomed.\nFollowing the battle, the federal government became convinced that all Indians had to be removed from the territory and the vicinity of any settlements, as settlers continued to migrate to the area. The fort was rebuilt in 1816.\nBackground.\nFort Dearborn was constructed by United States troops under the command of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28U.S.%20Army%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Whistler\"&gt;John Whistler&lt;/a&gt; in 1803. It was located on the south bank of the main stem of the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20River\"&gt;Chicago River&lt;/a&gt; in what is now the &lt;a href=\"Loop%2C%20Chicago\"&gt;Loop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Community%20areas%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;community area&lt;/a&gt; of downtown &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the area was seen as wilderness; in the view of later commander, Heald, \"so remote from the civilized part of the world.\" The fort was named in honor of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Dearborn\"&gt;Henry Dearborn&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War\"&gt;United States Secretary of War&lt;/a&gt;. It had been commissioned following the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Indian%20War\"&gt;Northwest Indian War&lt;/a&gt; of 1785\u20131795, and the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Greenville\"&gt;Treaty of Greenville&lt;/a&gt; at Fort Greenville (now &lt;a href=\"Greenville%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Greenville, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;), on August 3, 1795. As part of the terms of this treaty, a coalition of &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"frontier\"&gt;frontier&lt;/a&gt;smen, known as the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Confederacy\"&gt;Western Confederacy&lt;/a&gt;, turned over to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; large parts of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, and various other parcels of land including centered at the mouth of the Chicago River.\nThe British Empire had ceded the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Territory\"&gt;Northwest Territory&lt;/a&gt;\u2014comprising the modern day states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and parts of Minnesota\u2014to the United States in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29\"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt; in 1783. The area had been the subject of dispute between the Native American nations and the United States, however, since the passage of the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Ordinance\"&gt;Northwest Ordinance&lt;/a&gt; in 1787. The Indian Nations followed &lt;a href=\"Tenskwatawa\"&gt;Tenskwatawa&lt;/a&gt;, the Shawnee prophet and the brother of &lt;a href=\"Tecumseh\"&gt;Tecumseh&lt;/a&gt;. Tenskwatawa had a vision of purifying his society by expelling the \"children of the Evil Spirit\", the American settlers. Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh formed a confederation of numerous tribes to block American expansion. The British saw the Native American nations as valuable allies and a buffer to its Canadian colonies and provided them arms. Attacks on American settlers in the Northwest further aggravated tensions between Britain and the United States. The Confederation's raids hindered American access to potentially valuable farmlands, mineral deposits and fur trade areas.\nIn 1810, as a result of a long running feud, Captain Whistler and other senior officers at Fort Dearborn were removed. Whistler was replaced by Captain &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Heald\"&gt;Nathan Heald&lt;/a&gt;, who had been stationed at &lt;a href=\"Forts%20of%20Fort%20Wayne%2C%20Indiana%23Fort%20Wayne\"&gt;Fort Wayne, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. Heald was dissatisfied with his new posting and immediately applied for and received a leave of absence to spend the winter in &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. On his return journey to Fort Dearborn, he visited &lt;a href=\"Kentucky\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, where he married Rebekah Wells, the daughter of Samuel Wells, and they traveled together to the fort in June 1811.\nAs the United States and Britain moved towards war, antipathy between the settlers and Native Americans in the Fort Dearborn area increased. In the summer of 1811, British emissaries tried to enlist the support of Native Americans in the region, telling them that the British would help them to resist the encroaching American settlement. On April 6, 1812, a band of &lt;a href=\"Ho-Chunk\"&gt;Winnebago Indians&lt;/a&gt; murdered Liberty White, an American, and John B. Cardin, a French Canadian, at a farm called Hardscrabble that was located on the south branch of the Chicago River, in the area now called &lt;a href=\"Bridgeport%2C%20Chicago\"&gt;Bridgeport&lt;/a&gt;. News of the murder was carried to Fort Dearborn by a soldier of the garrison named John Kelso and a small boy who had managed to escape from the farm. Following the murder, some nearby settlers moved into the fort while the rest fortified themselves in a house that had belonged to Charles Jouett, a Native American agent. Fifteen men from the civilian population were organized into a militia by Captain Heald, and armed with guns and ammunition from the fort.\nBattle.\nOn June 18, 1812, the United States declared &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;war on the British Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and on July 17, British forces &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Fort%20Mackinac\"&gt;captured Fort Mackinac&lt;/a&gt;. On July 29, General &lt;a href=\"William%20Hull\"&gt;William Hull&lt;/a&gt; received news of the fall of Fort Mackinac and immediately sent orders to Heald to evacuate Fort Dearborn, fearing that it could no longer be adequately supplied with provisions. In his letter to Heald, which arrived at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dearborn\"&gt;Fort Dearborn&lt;/a&gt; on August 9, Hull ordered Heald to destroy all the arms and ammunition and give the remaining goods to friendly Indians in the hope of attaining an escort to Fort Wayne. Hull also sent a copy of these orders to Fort Wayne with additional instructions to provide Heald with all the information, advice and assistance within their power. In the following days, the sub-Native American agent at Fort Wayne, Captain &lt;a href=\"William%20Wells%20%28soldier%29\"&gt;William Wells&lt;/a&gt;, who was the uncle of Heald's wife, Rebekah, assembled a group of about 30 &lt;a href=\"Miami%20people\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; Native Americans. Wells, Corporal Walter K. Jordan, and the Miamis traveled to Fort Dearborn to provide an escort for the evacuees.\nWells arrived at Fort Dearborn on August 12 or 13 (sources differ), and on August 14, Heald held a council with the Potawatomi leaders to inform them of his intention to evacuate the fort. The Native Americans believed that Heald told them that he would distribute the firearms, ammunition, provisions and whiskey among them, and that, if they would send a band of Potawatomis to escort them safely to Fort Wayne, he would pay them a large sum of money. However, Heald ordered all the surplus arms, ammunition and liquor destroyed \"fearing that [the Native Americans] would make bad use of it if put in their possession.\" On August 14, a Potawatomi chief called &lt;a href=\"Black%20Partridge%20%28chief%29\"&gt;Black Partridge&lt;/a&gt; warned Heald that the young men of the tribe intended to attack, and that he could no longer restrain them.\nAt 9:00 am on August 15, the garrison\u2014comprising, according to Heald's report, 54 U.S. regulars, 12 militia, nine women and 18 children\u2014left Fort Dearborn with the intention of marching to Fort Wayne. Wells led the group with some of the Miami escorts, while the rest of the Miamis were positioned at the rear. About south of Fort Dearborn, a band of &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt; warriors ambushed the garrison. Heald reported that, upon discovering that the Indians were preparing to ambush from behind a dune, the company marched to the top of the dune, fired off a round and charged at the Native Americans.\nThis maneuver separated the cavalry from the wagons, allowing the overwhelming Native American force to charge into the gap, divide, and surround both groups. During the ensuing battle, some of the Native Americans charged at the wagon train that contained the women and children and the provisions. The wagons were defended by the militia, as well as Ensign Ronan and the fort physician Van Voorhis. The officers and militia were killed, along with two of the women and most of the children. Wells disengaged from the main battle and attempted to ride to the aid of those at the wagons. In doing so, he was brought down; according to eyewitness accounts he fought off many Native Americans before being killed, and a group of Indians immediately cut out his heart and ate it to absorb his courage. The battle lasted about 15 minutes, after which Heald and the surviving soldiers withdrew to an area of elevated ground on the prairie. They surrendered to the Native Americans who took them as prisoners to their camp near Fort Dearborn. In his report, Heald detailed the American loss at 26 regulars, all 12 of the militia, two women and twelve children killed, with the other 28 regulars, seven women, and six children taken prisoner. Survivors of the massacre filed different accounts regarding the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20warriors\"&gt;Miami warriors&lt;/a&gt;. Some said they fought for the Americans, while others said they did not fight at all.\nAccounts of the battle.\nThe recollections of a number of the survivors of the battle have been published. Heald's story was recorded on September 22, 1812, by Charles Askin in his diary, Heald also wrote brief accounts of events in his journal and in an official report of the battle. Walter Jordan recorded his version of events in a letter to his wife dated October 12, 1812. Helm wrote a detailed narrative of events; but, because of his fear of being court martialed due to his criticism of Heald, delayed publication until 1814. &lt;a href=\"John%20Kinzie\"&gt;John Kinzie&lt;/a&gt;'s recollections of the battle were recorded by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Schoolcraft\"&gt;Henry Schoolcraft&lt;/a&gt; in August 1820.\nThese accounts of details of the conflict are discrepant, particularly in their attribution of blame for the battle. &lt;a href=\"Juliette%20Augusta%20Magill%20Kinzie\"&gt;Juliette Magill Kinzie's&lt;/a&gt; \"Wau-Bun: The Early Day in the Northwest\", which was first published in 1856, provides the traditional account of the conflict. However it is based on family stories and is regarded as historically inaccurate. Nonetheless, its popular acceptance was surprisingly strong.\nThe Battle of Fort Dearborn has also been referred to as \"The Fort Dearborn Massacre\" by the defending Americans. The battle has been claimed a massacre due to the large number of Americans killed including women and children, as opposed to the relatively smaller Potawatami losses incurred. The conflict has also been argued to have been a measure of self-defense on the part of the Potawatami.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the battle, the Native Americans took their prisoners to their camp near Fort Dearborn and the fort was burned to the ground. The region remained empty of U.S. citizens until after the war ended. Some of the prisoners died in captivity, while others were later ransomed. The fort, however, was rebuilt in 1816.\nGeneral &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Harrison\"&gt;William Henry Harrison&lt;/a&gt;, who was not present at the battle, later claimed the Miami had fought against the Americans, and used the Battle of Fort Dearborn as a pretext to attack Miami villages. Miami Chief, &lt;a href=\"Pacanne\"&gt;Pacanne&lt;/a&gt;, and his nephew, &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Baptiste%20Richardville\"&gt;Jean Baptiste Richardville&lt;/a&gt;, accordingly ended their neutrality in the War of 1812, and allied with the British.\nHistorical perspective.\nSeen from the perspective of the War of 1812, and the larger conflict between Britain and France which precipitated it, this was a very small and brief battle, but it ultimately had larger consequences in the territory. Arguably, for the Native Americans, it was an example of \"winning the battle but losing the war\": the U.S. later pursued a policy of removing the tribes from the region, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;Treaty of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, which was marked at its culmination in 1835 by the last great Native American &lt;a href=\"war%20dance\"&gt;war dance&lt;/a&gt; in the then nascent city. Thereafter, the Potowatomie and other tribes were moved further west.\nLocation of the battle.\nEye-witness accounts place the battle on the lake shore somewhere between south of Fort Dearborn. Heald's official report said the battle occurred south of the fort, placing the battle at what is now the intersection of &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt%20Road\"&gt;Roosevelt Road&lt;/a&gt; (12th Street) and &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29\"&gt;Michigan Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. Juliette Kinzie, shortly before her death in 1870, stated that the battle had started by a large cottonwood tree, which at that time still stood on 18th Street between &lt;a href=\"Prairie%20Avenue\"&gt;Prairie Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and the lake. The tree was supposed to have been the last remaining of a grove of trees that had been saplings at the time of the battle.\nThe tree was blown down in a storm on May 16, 1894 and a portion of its trunk was preserved at the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20History%20Museum\"&gt;Chicago Historical Society&lt;/a&gt;. Historian Harry A. Musham points out that the testimony relating to this tree is all second hand and came from people who settled in Chicago more than 20 years after the battle. Moreover, based on the diameter of the preserved section of trunk (about ) he estimated the age of the tree at the time that it was blown over at no more than 80 years, and therefore asserts that it could not have been growing at the time of the battle. Nevertheless, the site at 18th Street and Prairie Avenue has become the location traditionally associated with the battle, and on the battle's 197th anniversary in 2009, the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Park%20District\"&gt;Chicago Park District&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Prairie%20District%20Neighborhood%20Alliance\"&gt;Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and other community partners dedicated \"Battle of Fort Dearborn Park\" near the site at 18th Street and Calumet Avenue.\nMonuments.\nIn 1893, George Pullman had a sculpture he had commissioned from &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Rohl-Smith\"&gt;Carl Rohl-Smith&lt;/a&gt; erected near his house. It portrays the rescue of Margaret Helm, the stepdaughter of Chicago resident &lt;a href=\"John%20Kinzie\"&gt;John Kinzie&lt;/a&gt; and wife of Lt. Linai Taliaferro Helm, by Potawatomi chief &lt;a href=\"Black%20Partridge%20%28chief%29\"&gt;Black Partridge&lt;/a&gt;, who led her and some others to Lake Michigan and helped her escape by boat. The monument was moved to the lobby of the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20History%20Museum\"&gt;Chicago Historical Society&lt;/a&gt; in 1931. In the 1970s, however, Native American groups protested the display of the monument, and it was removed. In the 1990s, the statue was reinstalled near 18th Street and Prairie Avenue, close to its original site, at the time of the revival of the &lt;a href=\"Prairie%20Avenue%20District\"&gt;Prairie Avenue Historic District&lt;/a&gt;. It was later removed for conservation reasons by the Office of Public Art of the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs. There are some efforts to reinstall the monument, but it is meeting resistance from the Chicago &lt;a href=\"American%20Indian%20Center\"&gt;American Indian Center&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe battle is also memorialized with a sculpture by Henry Hering called \"Defense\" that is located on the south western tender's house of the &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Avenue%20Bridge\"&gt;Michigan Avenue Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (which partially covers the site of Fort Dearborn). There are also memorials in Chicago to individuals who fought in the battle. William Wells is commemorated in the naming of Wells Street, a north-south street and part of the original 1830 58-block &lt;a href=\"plat\"&gt;plat&lt;/a&gt; of Chicago, while Nathan Heald is commemorated in the naming of &lt;a href=\"Heald%20Square%20Monument\"&gt;Heald Square&lt;/a&gt;. Ronan Park on the city's Far North Side honors Ensign &lt;a href=\"George%20Ronan\"&gt;George Ronan&lt;/a&gt;, who was the first &lt;a href=\"West%20Point\"&gt;West Point&lt;/a&gt; graduate to die in battle."
