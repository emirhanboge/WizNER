    "text": "Terry Michael Brunk (born December 12, 1964) is an American retired &lt;a href=\"professional%20wrestler\"&gt;professional wrestler&lt;/a&gt;, better known by his &lt;a href=\"ring%20name\"&gt;ring name&lt;/a&gt; Sabu. He is known for his trademark style of &lt;a href=\"hardcore%20wrestling\"&gt;hardcore wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, which he pioneered in his time with &lt;a href=\"Extreme%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;Extreme Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (ECW) from 1995 to 2000. He is a three-time World Heavyweight Champion having held the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;ECW World Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt; twice and the &lt;a href=\"NWA%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;NWA World Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt; once.\nUnder the tutelage of his uncle &lt;a href=\"Ed%20%26quot%3BThe%20Sheik%26quot%3B%20Farhat\"&gt;Ed \"The Sheik\" Farhat&lt;/a&gt;, Brunk began his career wrestling in the North American independent scene in 1985 under the name of Sabu, before traveling to Japan, competing in &lt;a href=\"Frontier%20Martial-Arts%20Wrestling\"&gt;Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (FMW) and &lt;a href=\"New%20Japan%20Pro-Wrestling\"&gt;New Japan Pro-Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (NJPW), winning several &lt;a href=\"Championship%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;championships&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"IWGP%20Junior%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to the United States in 1995, briefly working for &lt;a href=\"World%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;World Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (WCW), before beginning his most well-known stint in ECW, where he quickly became a fixture of the promotion. During his time in ECW, he became a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20ECW%20Champions\"&gt;two-time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ECW%20World%20Heavyweight%20Champion\"&gt;ECW World Heavyweight Champion&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20ECW%20Television%20Champions\"&gt;one-time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ECW%20World%20Television%20Champion\"&gt;ECW World Television Champion&lt;/a&gt;. He would have both a feud and an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Tazz\"&gt;The Tazmaniac&lt;/a&gt;, defeated him for the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20FTW%20Championship\"&gt;ECW FTW Championship&lt;/a&gt; and winning the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship\"&gt;ECW World Tag Team Championship&lt;/a&gt; with him. In 1997, Sabu began &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Van%20Dam%20and%20Sabu\"&gt;a tag team&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Van%20Dam\"&gt;Rob Van Dam&lt;/a&gt;, winning the ECW Tag Team Championship twice.\nAfter leaving ECW, Sabu wrestled in several national promotions, winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in 2000. In 2006, he was hired by WWE as part of their new third brand, a rebooted version of &lt;a href=\"ECW%20%28WWE%20brand%29\"&gt;ECW&lt;/a&gt;. Sabu would wrestle for WWE until he was fired in 2007. He also became a wrestler in &lt;a href=\"Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling\"&gt;Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (TNA, now Impact Wrestling) since the creation of the promotion in 2002.\nProfessional wrestling career.\nEarly career (1985\u20131991).\nBrunk was trained by his uncle, &lt;a href=\"The%20Sheik%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Ed Farhat&lt;/a&gt; (The Sheik), and was initially trained to be a technical wrestler. He began his wrestling career in 1985 in Farhat's promotion, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Time%20Wrestling%20%28Detroit%29\"&gt;Big Time Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, and was billed as being from &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; under the ring names \"Sabu the Elephant Boy\" (use of \"The Elephant Boy\" was later dropped) and \"Terry S.R.\" (the \"S.R.\" standing for \"Sheik's Revenge\"). During the 1980s, Brunk wrestled for various independent promotions in &lt;a href=\"Memphis%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Memphis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;. He was rarely billed under his real name, in order to avoid confusion with the similarly-named &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Funk\"&gt;Terry Funk&lt;/a&gt;, but has wrestled under his real name of Terry Brunk in Hawai'i.\nUnited States Wrestling Association (1991).\nIn 1991, Sabu made a few appearances for &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Wrestling%20Association\"&gt;United States Wrestling Association&lt;/a&gt; as Samu. He feuded with &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Jarrett\"&gt;Jeff Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Fuller\"&gt;Robert Fuller&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld Wrestling Federation (1993).\nSabu made three appearances for the &lt;a href=\"World%20Wrestling%20Federation\"&gt;World Wrestling Federation&lt;/a&gt;. He defeated &lt;a href=\"Scotty%202%20Hotty\"&gt;Scott Taylor&lt;/a&gt; in a dark match before \"&lt;a href=\"WWE%20Raw\"&gt;Monday Night Raw&lt;/a&gt;\" on October 18, 1993. He lost to &lt;a href=\"Owen%20Hart\"&gt;Owen Hart&lt;/a&gt; the next night for a dark match at a \"&lt;a href=\"Wrestling%20Challenge\"&gt;Wrestling Challenge&lt;/a&gt;\" taping and on the October 20 defeated Scott Taylor again in a dark match at a \"&lt;a href=\"WWF%20Superstars%20of%20Wrestling\"&gt;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;\" taping.\nFrontier Martial\u2013Arts Wrestling (1991\u20131994).\nIn 1991, Sabu made his first tour of Japan with &lt;a href=\"Frontier%20Martial-Arts%20Wrestling\"&gt;Frontier Martial\u2013Arts Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (FMW). While wrestling for FMW, Sabu received many of the scars on his arms and torso for which he became famous. Brunk cleared rumors that the scars were self-induced in a shoot interview with RF Video, confirming that they were a result of numerous hardcore matches he was involved in, including participating in over two dozen no-rope &lt;a href=\"barbed%20wire\"&gt;barbed wire&lt;/a&gt; death matches. In May 1992, Sabu teamed with his uncle, the Sheik, in a \"Ring of Fire Deathmatch\" against &lt;a href=\"Atsushi%20Onita\"&gt;Atsushi Onita&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tarzan%20Goto\"&gt;Tarzan Goto&lt;/a&gt;. The match was set in a ring where the ropes were replaced with barbed wire with sheets soaked in gas wrapped around it. As the match started, the ring crew lit the sheets on fire using torches. They were in the ring for about a minute before all men got out of the ring due to the intense heat. The match ended with no winner. Sabu said in an interview that the ring burned for 19 hours.\nSabu often competed in &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese hardcore matches, where he teamed with the &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Farhat\"&gt;Sheik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Jeet%20Singh\"&gt;Tiger Jeet Singh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horace%20Hogan\"&gt;Horace Boulder&lt;/a&gt;. Sabu &lt;a href=\"Feud%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;feuded&lt;/a&gt; with the likes of &lt;a href=\"Tarzan%20Goto\"&gt;Tarzan Goto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atsushi%20Onita\"&gt;Atsushi Onita&lt;/a&gt; in FMW. His final match in FMW was a loss to the debuting &lt;a href=\"Hayabusa%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Hayabusa&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Spectacular%20%281994%29\"&gt;1994 Summer Spectacular&lt;/a&gt;.\nEastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993\u20131995).\nSabu debuted in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;Eastern Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; in October 1993 at &lt;a href=\"NWA%20Bloodfest\"&gt;NWA Bloodfest&lt;/a&gt;. In his second match with the promotion, he defeated &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Douglas\"&gt;Shane Douglas&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;ECW Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrunk revealed in a shoot promo and in the documentary film \"&lt;a href=\"Forever%20Hardcore\"&gt;Forever Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;\" that in fact it was not &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Heyman\"&gt;Paul Heyman&lt;/a&gt; that brought him into &lt;a href=\"Extreme%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;Extreme Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (ECW) but that he was at the right place at the right time. He was referred by a friend to &lt;a href=\"Tod%20Gordon\"&gt;Tod Gordon&lt;/a&gt;. According to the storyline, Sabu, who at that time often arrived to the ring by his handler &lt;a href=\"911%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt;, was an uncontrollable madman strapped to a gurney and with a &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Lecter\"&gt;Hannibal Lecter&lt;/a&gt;-style face mask while trying to break free (he claimed to hate this part of his gimmick as he was normally tired before he started his match). Sabu could only be released from his bonds to wrestle his matches. Sabu also quickly became synonymous with table-breaking at this time; if a table was not broken during the match, Sabu would break a table with his own body after the bell had sounded, sometimes leading to 911 having to restrain Sabu during backstage interviews if a table was present.\nOne of the most notable aspects of Sabu's early career was his refusal to speak, a gimmick that he inherited from The Sheik (who never spoke English in public to protect &lt;a href=\"kayfabe\"&gt;kayfabe&lt;/a&gt;). In his early career, Sabu was billed as being from &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Mumbai\"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; (in real life he is a second generation &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20American\"&gt;Lebanese American&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;). In ECW, however, he was clearly heard speaking in the ring on several occasions and it was fairly common knowledge that Brunk was an American citizen from birth. This led to a joke at kayfabe's expense when Sabu began to be billed as hailing from \"Bombay, Michigan\".\nThe most significant matches during the early part of Sabu's career in ECW by defeating &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Funk\"&gt;Terry Funk&lt;/a&gt; to win the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;ECW World Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20World%20Television%20Championship\"&gt;ECW World Television Championship&lt;/a&gt; in a title versus title dream partner tag team match. Also, he was a part in the three way dance for the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;ECW World Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Night%20the%20Line%20Was%20Crossed\"&gt;The Night the Line Was Crossed&lt;/a&gt;, against Terry Funk and &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Douglas\"&gt;Shane Douglas&lt;/a&gt;, which went to a one-hour time limit draw and his tag team feud with &lt;a href=\"The%20Public%20Enemy%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;The Public Enemy&lt;/a&gt; in which Sabu and his partner &lt;a href=\"Tazz\"&gt;The Tazmaniac&lt;/a&gt; captured the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship\"&gt;ECW World Tag Team Championship&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Tables%20match\"&gt;double tables match&lt;/a&gt;. Another notable event occurred in April 1995 when, after being scheduled to compete in the main event of &lt;a href=\"ECW%20Three%20Way%20Dance\"&gt;Three Way Dance&lt;/a&gt; for the ECW World Tag Team title, Sabu no\u2013showed the event to accept a booking in Japan for &lt;a href=\"New%20Japan%20Pro-Wrestling\"&gt;New Japan Pro-Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (NJPW), which led Paul Heyman to publicly and &lt;a href=\"Legit%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;legitimately&lt;/a&gt; fire Sabu at the event. Sabu stated in the \"Forever Hardcore\" documentary that he by then had a career wrestling in Japan and now only wrestled once every so often for ECW; thus, he chose Japan over ECW.\nNew Japan Pro-Wrestling (1995).\nSabu wrestled for New Japan Pro-Wrestling throughout 1995, making a total of 64 appearances. He made his debut on January 4 in the &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Dome\"&gt;Tokyo Dome&lt;/a&gt;, teaming with &lt;a href=\"Masahiro%20Chono\"&gt;Masahiro Chono&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Junji%20Hirata\"&gt;Junji Hirata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tatsumi%20Fujinami\"&gt;Tatsumi Fujinami&lt;/a&gt;. Sabu and Chono teamed together on several more occasions to face &lt;a href=\"Heisei%20Ishingun\"&gt;Heisei Ishingun&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn May 3, 1995, Sabu defeated &lt;a href=\"Koji%20Kanemoto\"&gt;Koji Kanemoto&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fukuoka%20Yahuoku%21%20Dome\"&gt;Fukuoka Dome&lt;/a&gt; to win the &lt;a href=\"IWGP%20Junior%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He lost the title to Kanemoto on June 14, 1995 in Tokyo's &lt;a href=\"Nippon%20Budokan\"&gt;Nippon Budokan&lt;/a&gt; in a bout where Kanemoto's &lt;a href=\"UWA%20World%20Welterweight%20Championship\"&gt;UWA World Welterweight Championship&lt;/a&gt; was also on the line. He went on to face &lt;a href=\"Gran%20Hamada\"&gt;Gran Hamada&lt;/a&gt; in a series of matches, culminating in Sabu defeating Gran Hamada to win the &lt;a href=\"UWA%20World%20Junior%20Light%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt; on November 23, 1995 in the &lt;a href=\"Todoroki%20Arena\"&gt;Todoroki Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kawasaki%2C%20Kanagawa\"&gt;Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt;. He held the championship for just over a week, losing to &lt;a href=\"El%20Samurai\"&gt;El Samurai&lt;/a&gt; on December 1, 1995 in &lt;a href=\"Niigata%2C%20Niigata\"&gt;Niigata&lt;/a&gt;.\nSabu made his final appearance with NJPW on December 11, 1995 in Osaka, teaming with &lt;a href=\"Hiro%20Saito\"&gt;Hiro Saito&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Dean%20Malenko\"&gt;Dean Malenko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Benoit\"&gt;Wild Pegasus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld Championship Wrestling (1995).\nSabu made his WCW debut on the September 11, 1995 episode of \"&lt;a href=\"WCW%20Monday%20Nitro\"&gt;WCW Monday Nitro&lt;/a&gt;\" against &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Wright\"&gt;Alex Wright&lt;/a&gt;. Sabu won the match, but the decision was reversed when, after the match, he put Wright through a table. Sabu continued to wrestle some of the cruiserweights in WCW in the early days of the division, including a match against &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Lynn\"&gt;Mr. J.L.&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Havoc%20%281995%29\"&gt;Halloween Havoc&lt;/a&gt;. Sabu came out victorious against Mr. J.L. and following the match Sabu's uncle Sheik shot J.L. in the face with his trademark &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28wrestling%20move%29\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;. His last match in WCW was against &lt;a href=\"Disco%20Inferno%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Disco Inferno&lt;/a&gt;, which Sabu won.\nBig Japan and All Japan Pro Wrestling (1996-1997).\nSabu returned to Japan to work for &lt;a href=\"Big%20Japan%20Pro%20Wrestling\"&gt;Big Japan Pro Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; in March 1996. He had an 18 match winning streak first defeating &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Knight\"&gt;Jason Knight&lt;/a&gt; on March 13 to June 4 losing to &lt;a href=\"Kazuo%20Sakurada\"&gt;Kendo Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe made his debut for &lt;a href=\"All%20Japan%20Pro%20Wrestling\"&gt;All Japan Pro Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; in November 1996 teaming with &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Albright\"&gt;Gary Albright&lt;/a&gt;. In 1997, he teamed with &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Van%20Dam\"&gt;Rob Van Dam&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to ECW (1995\u20132000).\nSabu returned to ECW on November 18, 1995 at &lt;a href=\"November%20to%20Remember%201995\"&gt;November to Remember&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually engaged in matches and feuds with the likes of Rob Van Dam, with whom he later teamed up with and won the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship\"&gt;ECW World Tag Team Championship&lt;/a&gt; twice. In the meantime, former tag team partner Tazmaniac (who had shortened his name to \"Taz\") began to publicly challenge Sabu at every given opportunity, but got no response. After a year of call-outs and insults from Taz, Heyman revealed that he had asked Sabu, as a friend, to ignore Taz's challenge. This standoff culminated in a grudge match at ECW's first &lt;a href=\"pay-per-view\"&gt;pay-per-view&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ECW%20Barely%20Legal\"&gt;Barely Legal&lt;/a&gt;, which Taz won. Following the match, Taz's manager &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Alfonso\"&gt;Bill Alfonso&lt;/a&gt; turned on him and sided with Sabu and Rob Van Dam, who then formed a tag team. Sabu and Taz continued to feud on and off for the remainder of Taz's ECW career.\nSabu was later included in the WWF invasion &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Angle\"&gt;angle&lt;/a&gt;, in which ECW wrestlers invaded WWF's \"&lt;a href=\"WWE%20Raw\"&gt;Monday Night Raw&lt;/a&gt;\" program and held ECW-style matches and angles on the show. One memorable moment occurred at this show when Sabu appeared during a match and prepared for an aerial move off the \"R\" in the \"RAW\" lettered entryway onto Team Taz members, but accidentally fell off the \"R\". This was not planned which led to Sabu landing on top of Team Taz members and becoming an inside joke between him and Taz backstage. This invasion angle also led to a heel turn for Sabu in ECW, along with Van Dam and Alfonso, who began promoting the virtues of the WWF product over ECW's. Sabu feuded with ECW loyalists &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Dreamer\"&gt;Tommy Dreamer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Sandman%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;The Sandman&lt;/a&gt; during this period.\nOne of Sabu's most infamous matches was the No-Rope &lt;a href=\"barbed%20wire%20match\"&gt;barbed wire match&lt;/a&gt; with Terry Funk at &lt;a href=\"Born%20to%20be%20Wired\"&gt;Born to be Wired&lt;/a&gt;, a match which was promoted as being \"too extreme even for ECW\". In one of the most memorable moments in ECW history, Sabu attempted the \"Air Sabu\" corner splash on Funk, Terry moved and Sabu ended up colliding violently into the wire which tore open his biceps. He then asked his manager Bill Alfonso for some tape and after Alfonso went to get some Sabu began to tape the approximately 10 inch gash up. Funk has stated that, to this day, he has never seen anything like what Sabu did that night. The match ended with both men so badly tangled up together in the barbed wire that it took several ring technicians armed with wire cutters to free them from the predicament (on the DVD \"Bloodsport \u2013 ECW's Most Violent Matches\" released by &lt;a href=\"World%20Wrestling%20Entertainment\"&gt;World Wrestling Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, Paul Heyman said that the match was \"so gruesome, I never ever dared to schedule another one like it\", and that they never had another Barbed-Wire match in ECW because \"no one could top that one \u2013 and in good conscience, I never wanted anyone to try\").\nBrunk racked up an astounding catalog of injuries during his ECW tenure, including broken ribs, a broken jaw, and breaking his neck twice. The first time he broke his neck was during his match with &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Benoit\"&gt;Chris Benoit&lt;/a&gt; at the 1994 &lt;a href=\"November%20to%20Remember%201994\"&gt;November to Remember&lt;/a&gt;. Benoit threw Sabu with the intention that he would take a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20throws%23Flapjack\"&gt;flapjack&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bump%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;bump&lt;/a&gt;, but Brunk attempted to turn mid-air and take a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20throws%23Back%20body%20drop\"&gt;back body drop&lt;/a&gt; bump instead, which he was not able to do and landed on his head causing the injury. The other was during a match against Taz in December 1998, when Brunk took a &lt;a href=\"Suplex%23Head-and-arm%20suplex\"&gt;Taz\u2013Plex&lt;/a&gt; through a table and landed incorrectly. Brunk was able to recover from the neck injuries and return to wrestling, and he even wore a neck brace in his return match in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; a month following the injury at Taz's hands; by Brunk's account, however, he started actively wrestling in &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; with his partner on a short tour a little over two weeks after that injury. Brunk departed from ECW for the final time in early 2000.\nIndependent circuit (2000-2002).\nAfter leaving ECW, Sabu went to compete in the &lt;a href=\"independent%20circuit\"&gt;independent circuit&lt;/a&gt;. Worked for many promotions &lt;a href=\"Xtreme%20Pro%20Wrestling\"&gt;Xtreme Pro Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"IWA%20Mid-South\"&gt;IWA Mid-South&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stampede%20Wrestling\"&gt;Stampede Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Border%20City%20Wrestling\"&gt;Border City Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, and others. On April 29, 2000, he won a tournament for the vacated &lt;a href=\"XPW%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;XPW World Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt; defeating &lt;a href=\"John%20Kronus\"&gt;John Kronus&lt;/a&gt; in the first round, &lt;a href=\"Damien%20Steele\"&gt;Damien Steele&lt;/a&gt; in the second and &lt;a href=\"The%20Messiah%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;The Messiah&lt;/a&gt; in the finals. He was the only champion to defend the title outside of the States. He would hold the title for a year until it was taken away in May 2001 by Josh Lazie when Sabu was not present for an event. He would to return to &lt;a href=\"All%20Japan%20Pro%20Wrestling\"&gt;All Japan Pro Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 as a singles competitor. In 2001, he competed against &lt;a href=\"Abdullah%20the%20Butcher\"&gt;Abdullah the Butcher&lt;/a&gt; and Giant Kimala.\nOn July 8, 2001, he defeated &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Medina%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt; at ECW Reunion Show in Buffalo, New York. In 2002, he worked for &lt;a href=\"Pro-Pain%20Pro%20Wrestling\"&gt;Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;. He won the 3PW World Heavyweight Championship defeating &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Wolfe%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Gary Wolfe&lt;/a&gt; on October 19. He would drop the title to Wolfe on December 28.\nReturn to Frontier Martial\u2013Arts Wrestling (1997-2002).\nSabu returned to Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling on December 22, 1997 when he defeated ECW rival &lt;a href=\"The%20Sandman%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;The Sandman&lt;/a&gt; at Super Extreme Wrestling War 1997 at Tokyo's &lt;a href=\"Korakuen%20Hall\"&gt;Korakuen Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Then on December 13, 1998 he and &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Van%20Dam\"&gt;Rob Van Dam&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href=\"Dudley%20Boyz\"&gt;Dudley Boyz&lt;/a&gt; to retain the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship\"&gt;ECW World Tag Team Titles&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"ECW/FMW%20Supershow\"&gt;ECW/FMW Supershow&lt;/a&gt;. He would team up with &lt;a href=\"Corporal%20Kirchner\"&gt;Super Leather&lt;/a&gt; in a few tag team matches during 1999. \nOn February 3, 2002, Sabu defeated former ECW wrestlers The Sandman and &lt;a href=\"Vic%20Grimes\"&gt;Vic Grimes&lt;/a&gt; in a three way dance. The next day was his last match with FMW was when he teamed with &lt;a href=\"Tetsuhiro%20Kuroda\"&gt;Tetsuhiro Kuroda&lt;/a&gt; and lost to The Sandman and &lt;a href=\"Kodo%20Fuyuki\"&gt;Kodo Fuyuki&lt;/a&gt; for the vacated WEW Tag Team titles. This would be the promotion last event as it went bankrupt on the 15th.\nWorld Wrestling All-Stars (2002, 2003).\nSabu competed for the &lt;a href=\"World%20Wrestling%20All-Stars\"&gt;World Wrestling All-Stars&lt;/a&gt; (WWA) in a number of events during 2002 and 2003. This included four appearances on PPV and a number of memorable matches. His first appearance was at Revolution PPV in Las Vegas in February 2002. He faced &lt;a href=\"Crowbar%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Devon Storm&lt;/a&gt; in a hardcore match. He was defeated in this match after his manager &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Alfonso\"&gt;Bill Alfonso&lt;/a&gt; accidentally hit him with a chair after Storm moved out the way. After the match Sabu and Storm continued to fight onto the ring entrance way. Sabu placed Storm on a table and leaped from the entrance way through Storm and the table. This feud continued on the next PPV, the Eruption, in Australia in April. Sabu fought Storm in a steel cage match. The action spilled out of the ring and the cage with Sabu gaining the victory after leaping from the top of the cage through Storm, who was placed on top of two tables on top of each other.\nNext up Sabu took part in WWA European tour of November\u2013December 2002. This included the Retribution PPV in Glasgow, which was broadcast two months later in February 2003. On this tour and PPV he fought former fellow ECW stars &lt;a href=\"Perry%20Saturn\"&gt;Perry Saturn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Diamond\"&gt;Simon Diamond&lt;/a&gt; in a three-way hardcore match. Sabu took the victory in each of these matches, usually gaining the pinfall over Diamond after Saturn left the match to defend his companion. His final appearance for the WWA came in their last PPV, The Reckoning, in New Zealand. During this tour he first fought &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Douglas\"&gt;Shane Douglas&lt;/a&gt; but due to injury he did not face him at the PPV. Instead Douglas came to the ring and eventually allowed &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Hitchen\"&gt;Joe E Legend&lt;/a&gt; to face Sabu instead. Sabu won this match, his second and last WWA match ever. When the All World Wrestling League began in April 2003 (a spin-off of Big Time Wrestling), which was run by Eddie &amp; Tom Farhat, Sabu joined them for a while, before he left for another territory.\nTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling.\nEarly appearances and injury (2002\u20132004).\nSabu debuted in &lt;a href=\"Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling\"&gt;Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (TNA) on July 17, 2002, defeating &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Tuite\"&gt;Malice&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"ladder%20match\"&gt;ladder match&lt;/a&gt;. The next week he faced &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Shamrock\"&gt;Ken Shamrock&lt;/a&gt; in a ladder match which was declared a No Contest when Malice interfered.\nIn 2004, Sabu teamed with &lt;a href=\"Raven%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Raven&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Raven's former \"&lt;a href=\"Raven%27s%20Nest%23The%20Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;\" prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, &lt;a href=\"CM%20Punk\"&gt;CM Punk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Dinero\"&gt;Julio Dinero&lt;/a&gt;. In March, he began &lt;a href=\"Feud%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;feuding&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Monty%20Brown\"&gt;Monty Brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, who outnumbered him on several occasions after Raven failed to \"watch his back\". Eventually Raven challenged Sabu to an empty arena match to be held on June 9, but Sabu refused to wrestle him, claiming that he had promised his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Farhat\"&gt;The Sheik&lt;/a&gt;, that he would never fight Raven. Raven then waged a campaign against Sabu, disrespecting the memory of his uncle and assaulting Sabu's friend &lt;a href=\"Sonjay%20Dutt\"&gt;Sonjay Dutt&lt;/a&gt;, until Sabu finally broke and attacked him on July 23. Raven defeated Sabu on August 4, and a scheduled return match on August 18 was canceled after Sabu legitimately suffered a serious back injury.\nWhile injured, Brunk contracted a virus and was hospitalized, sidelining him for ten months. On December 12, a benefit show, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Night%20of%20Appreciation%20for%20Sabu\"&gt;A Night of Appreciation for Sabu&lt;/a&gt;\", was held by the AWWL to raise funds for him. The show was considered a success, raising enough money for Brunk to cover the costs of his medical care and he was able to make a full recovery. In his first match back from the injury in the AWWL/BTW, he defeated N8 Mattson. Sabu then appeared at \"&lt;a href=\"Hardcore%20Homecoming\"&gt;Hardcore Homecoming&lt;/a&gt;\", where he defeated &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Funk\"&gt;Terry Funk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Douglas\"&gt;Shane Douglas&lt;/a&gt; in a three-way no-ropes &lt;a href=\"barbed%20wire\"&gt;barbed wire&lt;/a&gt; match, and at &lt;a href=\"ECW%20One%20Night%20Stand%20%282005%29\"&gt;ECW One Night Stand&lt;/a&gt; two days later, where he defeated &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Rhyno&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecovery and departure (2005\u20132006).\nSabu returned to TNA on July 29, 2005. At &lt;a href=\"Sacrifice%20%282005%29\"&gt;Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; Sabu teamed with his old enemy, and then &lt;a href=\"NWA%20World%20Heavyweight%20Champion\"&gt;NWA World Heavyweight Champion&lt;/a&gt;, Raven to face &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Jarrett\"&gt;Jeff Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; and Rhino. Rhino and Jarrett won the match after Rhino &lt;a href=\"Spear%20%28wrestling%29\"&gt;gored&lt;/a&gt; Raven through a table and pinned him. The match saw Abyss interfering and attacking Sabu, starting a feud between the two of them. They went on to have a match at &lt;a href=\"Unbreakable%20%282005%29\"&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/a&gt; in September which Abyss won after performing his \"&lt;a href=\"Powerslam%23Spinning%20side%20slam\"&gt;Black Hole Slam&lt;/a&gt;\" finisher on to a pile of tacks in the ring. Sabu once again found himself squaring off against Rhino and Abyss, as well as &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Hardy\"&gt;Jeff Hardy&lt;/a&gt;, during &lt;a href=\"Bound%20for%20Glory%20%282005%29\"&gt;Bound for Glory&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Monster%27s%20Ball%20match\"&gt;Monster's Ball 2&lt;/a&gt; match. Rhino won the match. On the same night, Sabu competed in a ten-man &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20for%20the%20Gold\"&gt;Gauntlet Match&lt;/a&gt; to decide a number one contender, which he also lost, once again to Rhino.\nSabu continued his feud with Abyss, once again losing to him at &lt;a href=\"Genesis%20%282005%29\"&gt;Genesis&lt;/a&gt; after taking a Black Hole Slam onto a barbed wire steel chair. They met up again, in the promotion's first ever &lt;a href=\"Hardcore%20wrestling\"&gt;Barbed Wire Massacre&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Turning%20Point%20%282005%29\"&gt;Turning Point&lt;/a&gt;. Sabu finally beat Abyss, but following the match was not seen on TNA television for several months. He made his return at &lt;a href=\"Lockdown%20%282006%29\"&gt;Lockdown&lt;/a&gt; on April 23, 2006 in a match against &lt;a href=\"Samoa%20Joe\"&gt;Samoa Joe&lt;/a&gt; for Joe's &lt;a href=\"TNA%20X%20Division%20Championship\"&gt;TNA X Division Championship&lt;/a&gt;, despite Sabu having a broken forearm, a match he lost. Sabu was released soon afterwards from TNA.\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (2006\u20132007).\nShortly after his TNA release, on April 24, 2006, Sabu's official website reported that he had signed a one-year contract with &lt;a href=\"World%20Wrestling%20Entertainment\"&gt;World Wrestling Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20One%20Night%20Stand%20%282006%29\"&gt;ECW One Night Stand&lt;/a&gt; pay-per-view, Sabu faced &lt;a href=\"Rey%20Mysterio%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Rey Mysterio&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28WWE%29\"&gt;World Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the match, Mysterio found himself standing on a ringside table with Sabu flying at him. Sabu caught the champ in a front facelock and nailed him with a &lt;a href=\"DDT%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;DDT&lt;/a&gt; which caused both men to crash through the table. At this point, the WWE medical staff rushed to the injured men and declared neither man could continue and ordered the match stopped, resulting in a No Contest in which Mysterio kept his title.\nOn the June 13 premiere of \"&lt;a href=\"ECW%20on%20Sci%20Fi\"&gt;ECW on Sci Fi&lt;/a&gt;\", Sabu won a 10-man Extreme &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Battle%20royal\"&gt;Battle Royal&lt;/a&gt; with the stipulation that the winner face &lt;a href=\"John%20Cena\"&gt;John Cena&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20%282006%29\"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;. Sabu further fueled the feud during the next week's \"&lt;a href=\"WWE%20Raw\"&gt;Raw&lt;/a&gt;\", when he interfered in a Cena match and performed a \"Triple Jump Leg Drop\" on him, diving onto Cena and putting him through the announcers' table. Cena defeated Sabu in their \"Extreme &lt;a href=\"Lumberjack%20match\"&gt;Lumberjack match&lt;/a&gt;\" at Vengeance. On July 2, Sabu, traveling with fellow ECW wrestler Rob Van Dam, was arrested and charged with possession of &lt;a href=\"drug%20paraphernalia\"&gt;drug paraphernalia&lt;/a&gt;, and nine &lt;a href=\"Vicodin\"&gt;Vicodin&lt;/a&gt; tablets following a traffic stop in &lt;a href=\"Hanging%20Rock%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Hanging Rock, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; following a house show in Huntington, WV. Brunk was fined $1,000 based on the guidelines of WWE's Wellness Policy. He pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance and the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia was dropped. He was given a suspended sentence of 10 days in jail and a $500 fine. Meanwhile, he defeated Stevie Richards in an Extreme Rules match at \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%27s%20Main%20Event%20XXXIII\"&gt;Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTowards the end of July, Sabu began to talk on camera for himself \u2013 instead of using a &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;go between&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 and demanded a shot at &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Wight\"&gt;The Big Show&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"ECW%20Championship\"&gt;ECW World Championship&lt;/a&gt; which Paul Heyman refused to grant him in order to \"protect\" his champion. Instead he forced him into a match against the returning &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Angle\"&gt;Kurt Angle&lt;/a&gt; to determine a number one contender. When that match was interrupted by the returning Rob Van Dam another match was signed, Angle versus Van Dam versus Sabu, for the number one contendership (Angle then became too injured to compete and was pulled from the match). Sabu beat &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Van%20Dam\"&gt;Rob Van Dam&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"ladder%20match\"&gt;ladder match&lt;/a&gt; to win a shot at Big Show at &lt;a href=\"SummerSlam%20%282006%29\"&gt;SummerSlam&lt;/a&gt;, a match which he ended up losing.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Survivor%20Series%20%282006%29\"&gt;Survivor Series&lt;/a&gt;, Sabu teamed up with John Cena, &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Lashley\"&gt;Bobby Lashley&lt;/a&gt;, Rob Van Dam and &lt;a href=\"Kane%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Kane&lt;/a&gt; to face the team of The Big Show, Test, &lt;a href=\"Montel%20Vontavious%20Porter\"&gt;Montel Vontavious Porter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Finlay\"&gt;Finlay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Fatu\"&gt;Umaga&lt;/a&gt;. Sabu eliminated Test following a Tornado DDT, but he was later eliminated by Big Show via pinfall after receiving a chokeslam. In the end, Team Cena gained victory. At &lt;a href=\"December%20to%20Dismember%20%282006%29\"&gt;December to Dismember&lt;/a&gt;, Sabu was originally set to appear in the main event, an Extreme &lt;a href=\"Elimination%20Chamber\"&gt;Elimination Chamber&lt;/a&gt; match for the ECW World Championship against The Big Show, Test, Rob Van Dam, CM Punk and Bobby Lashley, but was \"taken out\" and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Holly\"&gt;Hardcore Holly&lt;/a&gt;. The following episode on \"ECW\", &lt;a href=\"CM%20Punk\"&gt;CM Punk&lt;/a&gt; and Rob Van Dam got on the mic before their match with Test and Hardcore Holly and dedicated the match to Sabu. When Punk and Van Dam won the match, Paul Heyman and his security team came out and had beaten down on the two. Sabu later made his return with a heavily wrapped arm to make the save. Sabu made his &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Rumble%20match\"&gt;Royal Rumble match&lt;/a&gt; debut in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Rumble%20%282007%29\"&gt;2007 Royal Rumble&lt;/a&gt; on January 28, where he was eliminated by Kane after receiving a chokeslam over the top rope and through a table.\nSabu joined the &lt;a href=\"ECW%20Originals\"&gt;ECW Originals&lt;/a&gt; along with Rob Van Dam, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Dreamer\"&gt;Tommy Dreamer&lt;/a&gt; and The Sandman.
