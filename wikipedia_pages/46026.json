    "text": "Wallachia or Walachia (; , ; &lt;a href=\"Archaism\"&gt;archaic&lt;/a&gt;: ', &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Cyrillic%20alphabet\"&gt;Romanian Cyrillic alphabet&lt;/a&gt;: ) is a &lt;a href=\"Historical%20regions%20of%20Romania\"&gt;historical&lt;/a&gt; and geographical region of &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. It is situated north of the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Lower Danube&lt;/a&gt; and south of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Carpathians\"&gt;Southern Carpathians&lt;/a&gt;. Wallachia is traditionally divided into two sections, &lt;a href=\"Muntenia\"&gt;Muntenia&lt;/a&gt; (Greater Wallachia) and &lt;a href=\"Oltenia\"&gt;Oltenia&lt;/a&gt; (Lesser Wallachia). Wallachia as a whole is sometimes referred to as Muntenia through identification with the larger of the two traditional sections.\nWallachia was founded as a &lt;a href=\"principality\"&gt;principality&lt;/a&gt; in the early 14th century by &lt;a href=\"Basarab%20I%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Basarab I&lt;/a&gt;, after a rebellion against &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Charles I of Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, although the first mention of the territory of Wallachia west of the river &lt;a href=\"Olt%20River\"&gt;Olt&lt;/a&gt; dates to a charter given to the &lt;a href=\"voivode\"&gt;voivode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Seneslau\"&gt;Seneslau&lt;/a&gt; in 1246 by &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9la%20IV%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;B\u00e9la IV of Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. In 1417, Wallachia was forced to accept the &lt;a href=\"suzerainty\"&gt;suzerainty&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;; this lasted until the 19th century, albeit with brief periods of Russian occupation between 1768 and 1854.\nIn 1859, Wallachia united with &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"United%20Principalities\"&gt;United Principalities&lt;/a&gt;, which adopted the name \"Romania\" in 1866 and officially became the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Kingdom of Romania&lt;/a&gt; in 1881. Later, following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Transylvania%20with%20Romania\"&gt;resolution of the elected representatives&lt;/a&gt; of Romanians in 1918, &lt;a href=\"Bukovina\"&gt;Bukovina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt; as well as parts of &lt;a href=\"Banat\"&gt;Banat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cri%C8%99ana\"&gt;Cri\u0219ana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maramure%C8%99\"&gt;Maramure\u0219&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919\"&gt;allocated&lt;/a&gt; to the Kingdom of Romania, thereby forming the modern Romanian state.\nEtymology.\nThe name Wallachia is an exonym, generally not used by Romanians themselves who used the denomination \"\u021aara Rum\u00e2neasc\u0103\" \u2013 Romanian Country or Romanian Land. The term \"Wallachia\" (however present in some Romanian texts as \"Valahia\" or \"Vlahia\") is derived from the term \"&lt;a href=\"walhaz\"&gt;walhaz&lt;/a&gt;\" used by &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20peoples\"&gt;Germanic peoples&lt;/a&gt; to describe Celts, and later &lt;a href=\"Romanization%20%28cultural%29\"&gt;romanized&lt;/a&gt; Celts and all Romance-speaking people. In &lt;a href=\"Northwestern%20Europe\"&gt;Northwestern Europe&lt;/a&gt; this gave rise to &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cornwall\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wallonia\"&gt;Wallonia&lt;/a&gt;, among others, while in &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Europe\"&gt;Southeast Europe&lt;/a&gt; it was used to designate &lt;a href=\"Romance%20languages\"&gt;Romance&lt;/a&gt;-speakers, and subsequently shepherds generally.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Early Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Church%20Slavonic%20language\"&gt;Slavonic&lt;/a&gt; texts, the name \"\" ( or \"Hungaro-Wallachian Land\") was also used as a designation for its location. The term, translated in Romanian as \"Ungrovalahia\", remained in use up to the modern era in a religious context, referring to the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Romanian Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Metropolis%20of%20Muntenia%20and%20Dobrudja\"&gt;Metropolitan seat of Hungaro-Wallachia&lt;/a&gt;, in contrast to &lt;a href=\"Thessaly\"&gt;Thessalian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Great%20Vlachia\"&gt;Great Vlachia&lt;/a&gt; in Greece or Small Wallachia (Mala Vla\u0161ka) in Serbia. The Romanian-language designations of the state were &lt;a href=\"Muntenia\"&gt;Muntenia&lt;/a&gt; (The Land of Mountains), \u021aara Rum\u00e2neasc\u0103 (the Romanian Land), Valahia, and, rarely, Rom\u00e2nia. The spelling variant \"\u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\" was adopted in official documents by the mid-19th century, however the version with \"u\" remained common in local dialects until much later.\nFor long periods after the 14th century, Wallachia was referred to as ' () by &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n sources, ' () by &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;n sources, ' () by &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; sources, and ' or ' by &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;-speaking (most notably &lt;a href=\"Transylvanian%20Saxons\"&gt;Transylvanian Saxon&lt;/a&gt;) sources. The traditional &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20language\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; name for Wallachia is ', literally \"Snowy Lowlands\", the older form of which is ', meaning \"Land beyond the snowy mountains\" (\"snowy mountains\" refers to the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Carpathians\"&gt;Southern Carpathians (the Transylvanian Alps)&lt;/a&gt;); its translation into Latin, ' was used in the official royal documents of the Kingdom of Hungary. In &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Turkish%20language\"&gt;Ottoman Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, the term ', or simply ' , appears. (Note that in a turn of linguistic luck utterly in favor of the Wallachians' eastward posterity, this toponym, at least according to the phonotactics of modern Turkish, is homophonous with another word, , meaning \"heavens\" or \"skies\".)\nArabic chronicles from the 13th century had used the name of Wallachia instead of &lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;. They gave the coordinates of Wallachia and specified that Wallachia was named ' and the dwellers ' or \"\".\nThe area of &lt;a href=\"Oltenia\"&gt;Oltenia&lt;/a&gt; in Wallachia was also known in Turkish as \"Kara-Eflak\" (\"Black Wallachia\") and \"Ku\u00e7uk-Eflak\" (\"Little Wallachia\"), while the former has also been used for Moldavia.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Trajan%27s%20Dacian%20Wars\"&gt;Second Dacian War&lt;/a&gt; (AD 105) western Oltenia became part of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20province\"&gt;Roman province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Dacia\"&gt;Dacia&lt;/a&gt;, with parts of Wallachia included in the &lt;a href=\"Moesia\"&gt;Moesia Inferior&lt;/a&gt; province. The Roman \"&lt;a href=\"Limes%20%28Roman%20Empire%29\"&gt;limes&lt;/a&gt;\" was initially built along the &lt;a href=\"Olt%20River\"&gt;Olt River&lt;/a&gt; in 119 before being moved slightly to the east in the second century, during which time it stretched from the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; up to &lt;a href=\"Ruc%C4%83r\"&gt;Ruc\u0103r&lt;/a&gt; in the Carpathians. The Roman line fell back to the Olt in 245 and, in 271, the Romans pulled out of the region.\nThe area was subject to &lt;a href=\"romanization%20%28cultural%29\"&gt;Romanization&lt;/a&gt; also during the &lt;a href=\"Migration%20Period\"&gt;Migration Period&lt;/a&gt;, when most of present-day Romania was also invaded by &lt;a href=\"Goths\"&gt;Goths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sarmatians\"&gt;Sarmatians&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Chernyakhov%20culture\"&gt;Chernyakhov culture&lt;/a&gt;, followed by waves of other &lt;a href=\"nomad\"&gt;nomad&lt;/a&gt;s. In 328, the Romans built a &lt;a href=\"Constantine%27s%20Bridge%20%28Danube%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Sucidava\"&gt;Sucidava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oescus\"&gt;Oescus&lt;/a&gt; (near &lt;a href=\"Gigen\"&gt;Gigen&lt;/a&gt;) which indicates that there was a significant trade with the peoples north of the Danube. A short period of Roman rule in the area is attested under Emperor &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Constantine the Great&lt;/a&gt;, after he attacked the Goths (who had settled north of the Danube) in 332. The period of Goth rule ended when the &lt;a href=\"Huns\"&gt;Huns&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Pannonian%20Basin\"&gt;Pannonian Basin&lt;/a&gt; and, under &lt;a href=\"Attila\"&gt;Attila&lt;/a&gt;, attacked and destroyed some 170 settlements on both sides of the Danube.\nEarly Middle Ages.\n&lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; influence is evident during the 5th to 6th century, such as the site at &lt;a href=\"Ipote%C8%99ti%E2%80%93C%C3%A2nde%C8%99ti%20culture\"&gt;Ipote\u0219ti\u2013C\u00e2nde\u0219ti culture&lt;/a&gt;, but from the second half of the 6th century and in the seventh century, &lt;a href=\"Slavs\"&gt;Slavs&lt;/a&gt; crossed the territory of Wallachia and settled in it, on their way to Byzantium, occupying the southern bank of the Danube. In 593, the Byzantine commander-in-chief &lt;a href=\"Priscus%20%28magister%20militum%29\"&gt;Priscus&lt;/a&gt; defeated Slavs, &lt;a href=\"Pannonian%20Avars\"&gt;Avars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gepids\"&gt;Gepids&lt;/a&gt; on future Wallachian territory, and, in 602, Slavs suffered a crucial defeat in the area; &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20%28emperor%29\"&gt;Flavius Mauricius Tiberius&lt;/a&gt;, who ordered his army to be deployed north of the Danube, encountered his troops' strong opposition.\nWallachia was under the control of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;First Bulgarian Empire&lt;/a&gt; from its establishment in 681, until approximately the &lt;a href=\"Hungarians\"&gt;Hungarians&lt;/a&gt;' conquest of &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 10th century. With the decline and subsequent &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20conquest%20of%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; (from the second half of the 10th century up to 1018), Wallachia came under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Pechenegs\"&gt;Pechenegs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20peoples\"&gt;Turkic peoples&lt;/a&gt; who extended their rule west through the 10th and 11th century, until they were defeated around 1091, when the &lt;a href=\"Cumans\"&gt;Cumans&lt;/a&gt; of southern Ruthenia took control of the lands of Wallachia. Beginning with the 10th century, Byzantine, Bulgarian, Hungarian, and later Western sources mention the existence of small polities, possibly peopled by, among others, &lt;a href=\"Vlachs\"&gt;Vlachs&lt;/a&gt; led by \"&lt;a href=\"knyaz\"&gt;knyaz&lt;/a&gt;es\" and \"&lt;a href=\"voivode\"&gt;voivode&lt;/a&gt;s\".\nIn 1241, during the &lt;a href=\"Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Mongol invasion of Europe&lt;/a&gt;, Cuman domination was ended\u2014a direct Mongol rule over Wallachia was not attested, but it remains probable. Part of Wallachia was probably briefly disputed by the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Kingdom of Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;Bulgarians&lt;/a&gt; in the following period, but it appears that the severe weakening of Hungarian authority during the Mongol attacks contributed to the establishment of the new and stronger polities attested in Wallachia for the following decades.\nCreation.\nOne of the first written pieces of evidence of local voivodes is in connection with &lt;a href=\"Litovoi\"&gt;Litovoi&lt;/a&gt; (1272), who ruled over land each side of the Carpathians (including &lt;a href=\"Ha%C8%9Beg%20Country\"&gt;Ha\u021beg Country&lt;/a&gt; in Transylvania), and refused to pay &lt;a href=\"tribute\"&gt;tribute&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ladislaus%20IV%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Ladislaus IV of Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. His successor was his brother &lt;a href=\"B%C4%83rbat\"&gt;B\u0103rbat&lt;/a&gt; (1285\u20131288). The continuing weakening of the Hungarian state by further Mongol invasions (1285\u20131319) and the fall of the &lt;a href=\"%C3%81rp%C3%A1d%20dynasty\"&gt;\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty&lt;/a&gt; opened the way for the unification of Wallachian polities, and to independence from Hungarian rule.\nWallachia's creation, held by local traditions to have been the work of one \"&lt;a href=\"Radu%20Negru\"&gt;Radu Negru&lt;/a&gt;\" (Black Radu), is historically connected with &lt;a href=\"Basarab%20I%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Basarab I of Wallachia&lt;/a&gt; (1310\u20131352), who rebelled against &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Charles I of Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and took up rule on either side of the Olt, establishing his residence in &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A2mpulung\"&gt;C\u00e2mpulung&lt;/a&gt; as the first ruler of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Basarab\"&gt;House of Basarab&lt;/a&gt;. Basarab refused to grant Hungary the lands of &lt;a href=\"F%C4%83g%C4%83ra%C8%99\"&gt;F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alma%C8%99\"&gt;Alma\u0219&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Banate%20of%20Severin\"&gt;Banate of Severin&lt;/a&gt;, defeated Charles in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Posada\"&gt;Battle of Posada&lt;/a&gt; (1330), and, according to Romanian historian &lt;a href=\"%C8%98tefan%20%C8%98tef%C4%83nescu\"&gt;\u0218tefan \u0218tef\u0103nescu&lt;/a&gt;, extended his lands to the east, to comprise lands as far as &lt;a href=\"Kiliya\"&gt;Kiliya&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Budjak\"&gt;Budjak&lt;/a&gt; (reportedly providing the origin of \"&lt;a href=\"Bessarabia\"&gt;Bessarabia&lt;/a&gt;\"); the supposed rule over the latter was not preserved by the princes that followed, as Kilia was under the rule of the &lt;a href=\"Nogais\"&gt;Nogais&lt;/a&gt; c.1334.\nThere is evidence that the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;Second Bulgarian Empire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20lands%20across%20the%20Danube\"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; at least nominally the Wallachian lands up to the Ruc\u0103r\u2013&lt;a href=\"Bran%2C%20Bra%C8%99ov\"&gt;Bran&lt;/a&gt; corridor as late as the late 14th century. In a charter by &lt;a href=\"Radu%20I%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Radu I&lt;/a&gt;, the Wallachian voivode requests that &lt;a href=\"tsar\"&gt;tsar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Alexander%20of%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; order his customs officers at Ruc\u0103r and the &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A2mbovi%C5%A3a%20River\"&gt;D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a River&lt;/a&gt; bridge to collect tax following the law. The presence of Bulgarian customs officers at the &lt;a href=\"Carpathians\"&gt;Carpathians&lt;/a&gt; indicates a Bulgarian suzerainty over those lands, though Radu's imperative tone hints at a strong and increasing Wallachian autonomy. Under &lt;a href=\"Radu%20I%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Radu I&lt;/a&gt; and his successor &lt;a href=\"Dan%20I%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Dan I&lt;/a&gt;, the realms in Transylvania and Severin continued to be disputed with Hungary. Basarab was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Alexander%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Nicholas Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Vladislav%20I%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Vladislav I&lt;/a&gt;. Vladislav attacked Transylvania after &lt;a href=\"Louis%20I%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Louis I&lt;/a&gt; occupied lands south of the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt;, conceded to recognize him as overlord in 1368, but rebelled again in the same year; his rule also witnessed the first confrontation between Wallachia and the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; (a battle in which Vladislav was allied with &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Shishman%20of%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Ivan Shishman&lt;/a&gt;).\n1400\u20131600.\nMircea the Elder to Radu the Great.\nAs the entire &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt; became an integral part of the growing Ottoman Empire (a process that concluded with the &lt;a href=\"fall%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;fall of Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; to Sultan &lt;a href=\"Mehmed%20the%20Conqueror\"&gt;Mehmed the Conqueror&lt;/a&gt; in 1453), Wallachia became engaged in frequent confrontations in the final years of the reign of &lt;a href=\"Mircea%20I%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Mircea I&lt;/a&gt; (r. 1386\u20131418). Mircea initially defeated the Ottomans in several battles, including the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Rovine\"&gt;Battle of Rovine&lt;/a&gt; in 1394, driving them away from &lt;a href=\"Dobruja\"&gt;Dobruja&lt;/a&gt; and briefly extending his rule to the &lt;a href=\"Danube%20Delta\"&gt;Danube Delta&lt;/a&gt;, Dobruja and &lt;a href=\"Silistra\"&gt;Silistra&lt;/a&gt; (c. 1400\u20131404). He swung between alliances with &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Poland%20%281385%E2%80%931569%29\"&gt;Jagiellon Poland&lt;/a&gt; (taking part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Nicopolis\"&gt;Battle of Nicopolis&lt;/a&gt;), and accepted a peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1417, after &lt;a href=\"Mehmed%20I\"&gt;Mehmed I&lt;/a&gt; took control of &lt;a href=\"Turnu%20M%C4%83gurele\"&gt;Turnu M\u0103gurele&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giurgiu\"&gt;Giurgiu&lt;/a&gt;. The two ports remained part of the Ottoman state, with brief interruptions, until 1829. In 1418\u20131420, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20I%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Michael I&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Ottomans in Severin, only to be killed in battle by the counter-offensive; in 1422, the danger was averted for a short while when &lt;a href=\"Dan%20II%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Dan II&lt;/a&gt; inflicted a defeat on &lt;a href=\"Murad%20II\"&gt;Murad II&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Pippo%20Spano\"&gt;Pippo Spano&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe peace signed in 1428 inaugurated a period of internal crisis, as Dan had to defend himself against &lt;a href=\"Radu%20II%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Radu II&lt;/a&gt;, who led the first in a series of boyar coalitions against established princes. Victorious in 1431 (the year when the boyar-backed &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20I%20Aldea\"&gt;Alexander I Aldea&lt;/a&gt; took the throne), boyars were dealt successive blows by &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20II%20Dracul\"&gt;Vlad II Dracul&lt;/a&gt; (1436\u20131442; 1443\u20131447), who nevertheless attempted to compromise between the Ottoman Sultan and the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following decade was marked by the conflict between the rival houses of &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20D%C4%83ne%C8%99ti\"&gt;D\u0103ne\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Dr%C4%83cule%C8%99ti\"&gt;Dr\u0103cule\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;. Faced with both internal and external conflict, &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20II%20Dracul\"&gt;Vlad II Dracul&lt;/a&gt; reluctantly agreed to pay the &lt;a href=\"tribute\"&gt;tribute&lt;/a&gt; demanded of him by the Ottoman Empire, despite his affiliation with the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Order of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, a group of independent noblemen whose creed had been to repel the Ottoman invasion. As part of the tribute, the sons of &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20II%20Dracul\"&gt;Vlad II Dracul&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Radu%20cel%20Frumos\"&gt;Radu cel Frumos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20the%20Impaler\"&gt;Vlad III Dracula&lt;/a&gt;) were taken into Ottoman custody. Recognizing the Christian resistance to their invasion, leaders of the Ottoman Empire released Vlad III to rule in 1448 after his father's assassination in 1447.\nKnown as Vlad III the Impaler or Vlad III Dracula, he immediately put to death the &lt;a href=\"boyar\"&gt;boyar&lt;/a&gt;s who had conspired against his father, and was characterized as both a national hero and a cruel &lt;a href=\"tyrant\"&gt;tyrant&lt;/a&gt;. He was cheered for restoring order to a destabilized principality, yet showed no mercy toward thieves, murderers or anyone who plotted against his rule. Vlad demonstrated his intolerance for criminals by utilizing &lt;a href=\"impalement\"&gt;impalement&lt;/a&gt; as a form of execution, having learned of the method of the impalement from his youth spent in Ottoman captivity. Vlad fiercely resisted Ottoman rule, having both repelled the Ottomans and been pushed back several times.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Transylvanian%20Saxons\"&gt;Transylvanian Saxons&lt;/a&gt; were also furious with him for strengthening the borders of Wallachia, which interfered with their control of trade routes. In retaliation, the Saxons distributed grotesque poems of cruelty and other propaganda, demonizing Vlad III Dracula as a drinker of blood. These tales strongly influenced an eruption of vampiric fiction throughout the West and, in particular, Germany. They also inspired the main character in the 1897 Gothic novel \"&lt;a href=\"Dracula\"&gt;Dracula&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Bram%20Stoker\"&gt;Bram Stoker&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 1462, Vlad III defeated Mehmed the Conqueror's offensive during the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Attack%20at%20T%C3%A2rgovi%C5%9Fte\"&gt;Night Attack at T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte&lt;/a&gt; before being forced to retreat to &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2rgovi%C8%99te\"&gt;T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te&lt;/a&gt; and accepting to pay an increased tribute. Meanwhile, Vlad III faced parallel conflicts with his brother, Radu cel Frumos, (r. 1437/1439\u20141475), and &lt;a href=\"Basarab%20Laiot%C4%83%20cel%20B%C4%83tr%C3%A2n\"&gt;Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt;. This led to the conquest of Wallachia by Radu, who would face his own struggles with the resurgent Vlad III and Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n during his 11-year reign. Subsequently, &lt;a href=\"Radu%20IV%20the%20Great\"&gt;Radu IV the Great&lt;/a&gt; (Radu cel Mare, who ruled 1495\u20131508) reached several compromises with the boyars, ensuring a period of internal stability that contrasted his clash with &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20III%20the%20One-Eyed\"&gt;Bogdan III the One-Eyed&lt;/a&gt; of Moldavia.\nMihnea cel R\u0103u to Petru Cercel.\nThe late 15th century saw the ascension of the powerful &lt;a href=\"Craiove%C8%99ti\"&gt;Craiove\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; family, virtually independent rulers of the &lt;a href=\"Oltenia\"&gt;Oltenia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Ban%20%28title%29\"&gt;banat&lt;/a&gt;, who sought Ottoman support in their rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Mihnea%20cel%20R%C4%83u\"&gt;Mihnea cel R\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; (1508\u20131510) and replaced him with &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20cel%20T%C3%A2n%C4%83r\"&gt;Vl\u0103du\u021b&lt;/a&gt;. After the latter proved to be hostile to the bans, the House of Basarab formally ended with the rise of &lt;a href=\"Neagoe%20Basarab\"&gt;Neagoe Basarab&lt;/a&gt;, a Craiove\u015fti. Neagoe's peaceful rule (1512\u20131521) was noted for its cultural aspects (the building of the &lt;a href=\"Curtea%20de%20Arge%C5%9F%20Cathedral\"&gt;Curtea de Arge\u015f Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; influences). It was also a period of increased influence for the &lt;a href=\"Transylvanian%20Saxons\"&gt;Saxon&lt;/a&gt; merchants in &lt;a href=\"Bra%C8%99ov\"&gt;Bra\u0219ov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sibiu\"&gt;Sibiu&lt;/a&gt;, and of Wallachia's alliance with &lt;a href=\"Louis%20II%20of%20Hungary%20and%20Bohemia\"&gt;Louis II of Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. Under &lt;a href=\"Teodosie\"&gt;Teodosie&lt;/a&gt;, the country was again under a four-month-long Ottoman occupation, a military administration that seemed to be an attempt to create a Wallachian \"&lt;a href=\"Subdivisions%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Pashaluk&lt;/a&gt;\". This danger rallied all boyars in support of &lt;a href=\"Radu%20de%20la%20Afuma%C5%A3i\"&gt;Radu de la Afuma\u0163i&lt;/a&gt; (four rules between 1522 and 1529), who lost the battle after an agreement between the Craiove\u0219ti and Sultan &lt;a href=\"S%C3%BCleyman%20I\"&gt;S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent&lt;/a&gt;; Prince Radu eventually confirmed S\u00fcleyman's position as suzerain and agreed to pay an even higher tribute.\nOttoman suzerainty remained virtually unchallenged throughout the following 90 years. &lt;a href=\"Radu%20Paisie\"&gt;Radu Paisie&lt;/a&gt;, who was deposed by S\u00fcleyman in 1545, ceded the port of &lt;a href=\"Br%C4%83ila\"&gt;Br\u0103ila&lt;/a&gt; to Ottoman administration in the same year. His successor &lt;a href=\"Mircea%20Ciobanul\"&gt;Mircea Ciobanul&lt;/a&gt; (1545\u20131554; 1558\u20131559), a prince without any claim to noble heritage, was imposed on the throne and consequently agreed to a decrease in autonomy (increasing &lt;a href=\"tax\"&gt;tax&lt;/a&gt;es and carrying out an armed intervention in Transylvania \u2013 supporting the pro-Turkish &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A1nos%20Szapolyai\"&gt;John Z\u00e1polya&lt;/a&gt;). Conflicts between boyar families became stringent after the rule of &lt;a href=\"P%C4%83tra%C8%99cu%20cel%20Bun\"&gt;P\u0103tra\u0219cu the Good&lt;/a&gt;, and boyar ascendancy over rulers was obvious under &lt;a href=\"Petru%20cel%20T%C3%A2n%C4%83r\"&gt;Petru the Younger&lt;/a&gt; (1559\u20131568; a reign dominated by &lt;a href=\"Chiajna\"&gt;Doamna Chiajna&lt;/a&gt; and marked by huge increases in taxes), &lt;a href=\"Mihnea%20Turcitul\"&gt;Mihnea Turcitul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Petru%20Cercel\"&gt;Petru Cercel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ottoman Empire increasingly relied on Wallachia and Moldavia for the supply and maintenance of its &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;military forces&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Wallachian%20Army\"&gt;local army&lt;/a&gt;, however, soon disappeared due to the increased costs and the much more obvious efficiency of &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; troops.\n17th century.\nInitially profiting from Ottoman support, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20the%20Brave\"&gt;Michael the Brave&lt;/a&gt; ascended to the throne in 1593, and attacked the troops of &lt;a href=\"Murad%20III\"&gt;Murad III&lt;/a&gt; north and south of the Danube in an alliance with Transylvania's &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%20B%C3%A1thory\"&gt;Sigismund B\u00e1thory&lt;/a&gt; and Moldavia's &lt;a href=\"Aron%20Vod%C4%83\"&gt;Aron Vod\u0103&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20C%C4%83lug%C4%83reni\"&gt;Battle of C\u0103lug\u0103reni&lt;/a&gt;). He soon placed himself under the suzerainty of &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Rudolf II&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, and, in 1599\u20131600, intervened in &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Polish%20monarchs\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%20III%20Vasa\"&gt;Sigismund III Vasa&lt;/a&gt;, placing the region under his authority; his brief rule also extended to &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt; later in the following year. For a brief period, Michael the Brave ruled (in a personal, but not formal, union) all the territories where Romanians lived, rebuilding the mainland of the ancient Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Dacia\"&gt;Dacia&lt;/a&gt;. The rule of Michael the Brave, with its break with Ottoman rule, tense relations with other European powers and the leadership of the three states, was considered in later periods as the precursor of a modern &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, a thesis which was argued with noted intensity by &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20B%C4%83lcescu\"&gt;Nicolae B\u0103lcescu&lt;/a&gt;. Following Michael's downfall, Wallachia was occupied by the Polish\u2013Moldavian army of &lt;a href=\"Simion%20Movil%C4%83\"&gt;Simion Movil\u0103&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Moldavian%20Magnate%20Wars\"&gt;Moldavian Magnate Wars&lt;/a&gt;), who held the region until 1602, and was subject to &lt;a href=\"Nogais\"&gt;Nogai&lt;/a&gt; attacks in the same year.\nThe last stage in the &lt;a href=\"Growth%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Growth of the Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; brought increased pressures on Wallachia: political control was accompanied by Ottoman economical hegemony, the discarding of the capital in &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2rgovi%C8%99te\"&gt;T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te&lt;/a&gt; in favour of &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; (closer to the Ottoman border, and a rapidly growing trade center), the establishment of &lt;a href=\"serfdom\"&gt;serfdom&lt;/a&gt; under Michael the Brave as a measure to increase &lt;a href=\"Manorialism\"&gt;manorial&lt;/a&gt; revenues, and the decrease in importance of low-ranking boyars (threatened with extinction, they took part in the \"&lt;a href=\"seimeni\"&gt;seimeni&lt;/a&gt;\" rebellion of 1655). Furthermore, the growing importance of appointment to high office in front of land ownership brought about an influx of &lt;a href=\"Greeks%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Levant\"&gt;Levant&lt;/a&gt;ine families, a process already resented by locals during the rules of &lt;a href=\"Radu%20Mihnea\"&gt;Radu Mihnea&lt;/a&gt; in the early 17th century. &lt;a href=\"Matei%20Basarab\"&gt;Matei Basarab&lt;/a&gt;, a boyar appointee, brought a long period of relative peace (1632\u20131654), with the noted exception of the 1653 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Finta\"&gt;Battle of Finta&lt;/a&gt;, fought between Wallachians and the troops of Moldavian prince &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Lupu\"&gt;Vasile Lupu&lt;/a&gt;\u2014ending in disaster for the latter, who was replaced with Prince Matei's favourite, &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20%C8%98tefan\"&gt;Gheorghe \u0218tefan&lt;/a&gt;, on the throne in &lt;a href=\"Ia%C8%99i\"&gt;Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt;. A close alliance between Gheorghe \u0218tefan and Matei's successor &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20%C8%98erban\"&gt;Constantin \u0218erban&lt;/a&gt; was maintained by Transylvania's &lt;a href=\"George%20II%20R%C3%A1k%C3%B3czi\"&gt;George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi&lt;/a&gt;, but their designs for independence from Ottoman rule were crushed by the troops of &lt;a href=\"Mehmed%20IV\"&gt;Mehmed IV&lt;/a&gt; in 1658\u20131659. The reigns of &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Ghica\"&gt;Gheorghe Ghica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grigore%20I%20Ghica\"&gt;Grigore I Ghica&lt;/a&gt;, the sultan's favourites, signified attempts to prevent such incidents; however, they were also the onset of a violent clash between the &lt;a href=\"B%C4%83leanu%20family\"&gt;B\u0103leanu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cantacuzino%20family\"&gt;Cantacuzino&lt;/a&gt; boyar families, which was to mark Wallachia's history until the 1680s. The Cantacuzinos, threatened by the alliance between the B\u0103leanus and the &lt;a href=\"Ghica%20family\"&gt;Ghicas&lt;/a&gt;, backed their own choice of princes (&lt;a href=\"Antonie%20Vod%C4%83%20din%20Pope%C8%99ti\"&gt;Antonie Vod\u0103 din Pope\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20Ducas\"&gt;George Ducas&lt;/a&gt;) before promoting themselves\u2014with the ascension of &lt;a href=\"%C8%98erban%20Cantacuzino\"&gt;\u0218erban Cantacuzino&lt;/a&gt; (1678\u20131688).\nRusso-Turkish Wars and the Phanariotes.\nWallachia became a target for &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg&lt;/a&gt; incursions during the last stages of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Turkish%20War\"&gt;Great Turkish War&lt;/a&gt; around 1690, when the ruler &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Br%C3%A2ncoveanu\"&gt;Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu&lt;/a&gt; secretly and unsuccessfully negotiated an anti-Ottoman coalition. Br\u00e2ncoveanu's reign (1688\u20131714), noted for its late &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; cultural achievements (see &lt;a href=\"Br%C3%A2ncovenesc%20style\"&gt;Br\u00e2ncovenesc style&lt;/a&gt;), also coincided with the rise of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russia\"&gt;Imperial Russia&lt;/a&gt; under Tsar &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Great\"&gt;Peter the Great&lt;/a&gt;\u2014he was approached by the latter during the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281710%E2%80%9311%29\"&gt;Russo-Turkish War of 1710\u201311&lt;/a&gt;, and lost his throne and life sometime after sultan &lt;a href=\"Ahmed%20III\"&gt;Ahmed III&lt;/a&gt; caught news of the negotiations. Despite his denunciation of Br\u00e2ncoveanu's policies, &lt;a href=\"%C8%98tefan%20Cantacuzino\"&gt;\u0218tefan Cantacuzino&lt;/a&gt; attached himself to Habsburg projects and opened the country to the armies of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy\"&gt;Prince Eugene of Savoy&lt;/a&gt;; he was himself deposed and executed in 1716.\nImmediately following the deposition of Prince \u0218tefan, the Ottomans renounced the purely nominal &lt;a href=\"Elective%20monarchy\"&gt;elective&lt;/a&gt; system (which had by then already witnessed the decrease in importance of the &lt;a href=\"Sfatul%20boieresc\"&gt;Boyar Divan&lt;/a&gt; over the sultan's decision), and princes of the two &lt;a href=\"Danubian%20Principalities\"&gt;Danubian Principalities&lt;/a&gt; were appointed from the &lt;a href=\"Phanariotes\"&gt;Phanariotes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;. Inaugurated by &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Mavrocordatos\"&gt;Nicholas Mavrocordatos&lt;/a&gt; in Moldavia after &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20Cantemir\"&gt;Dimitrie Cantemir&lt;/a&gt;, Phanariote rule was brought to Wallachia in 1715 by the very same ruler. The tense relations between boyars and princes brought a decrease in the number of taxed people (as a &lt;a href=\"Privilege%20%28legal%20ethics%29\"&gt;privilege&lt;/a&gt; gained by the former), a subsequent increase in total taxes, and the enlarged powers of a boyar circle in the Divan.\nIn parallel, Wallachia became the battleground in a succession of wars between the Ottomans on one side and Russia or the Habsburg Monarchy on the other. Mavrocordatos himself was deposed by a boyar rebellion, and arrested by Habsburg troops during the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Turkish%20War%20of%201716%E2%80%9318\"&gt;Austro-Turkish War of 1716\u201318&lt;/a&gt;, as the Ottomans had to concede &lt;a href=\"Oltenia\"&gt;Oltenia&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles VI of Austria&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Passarowitz\"&gt;Treaty of Passarowitz&lt;/a&gt;). The region, organized as the &lt;a href=\"Banat%20of%20Craiova\"&gt;Banat of Craiova&lt;/a&gt; and subject to an &lt;a href=\"Enlightened%20absolutism\"&gt;enlightened absolutist&lt;/a&gt; rule that soon disenchanted local boyars, was returned to Wallachia in 1739 (the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Belgrade\"&gt;Treaty of Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;, upon the close of the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Russian%E2%80%93Turkish%20War%20%281735%E2%80%9339%29\"&gt;Austro-Russian\u2013Turkish War (1735\u201339)&lt;/a&gt;). Prince &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20Mavrocordatos\"&gt;Constantine Mavrocordatos&lt;/a&gt;, who oversaw the new change in borders, was also responsible for the effective abolition of &lt;a href=\"serfdom\"&gt;serfdom&lt;/a&gt; in 1746 (which put a stop to the exodus of peasants into &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;); during this period, the &lt;a href=\"Ban%20%28title%29\"&gt;ban&lt;/a&gt; of Oltenia moved his residence from &lt;a href=\"Craiova\"&gt;Craiova&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, signalling, alongside Mavrocordatos' order to merge his personal &lt;a href=\"treasury\"&gt;treasury&lt;/a&gt; with that of the country, a move towards &lt;a href=\"Centralized%20government\"&gt;centralism&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1768, during the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281768%E2%80%9374%29\"&gt;Fifth Russo-Turkish War&lt;/a&gt;, Wallachia was placed under its first Russian occupation (helped along by the rebellion of &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A2rvu%20Cantacuzino\"&gt;P\u00e2rvu Cantacuzino&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20K%C3%BC%C3%A7%C3%BCk%20Kaynarca\"&gt;Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca&lt;/a&gt; (1774) allowed Russia to intervene in favour of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; Ottoman subjects, curtailing Ottoman pressures\u2014including the decrease in sums owed as &lt;a href=\"tribute\"&gt;tribute&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and, in time, relatively increasing internal stability while opening Wallachia to more Russian interventions.\nHabsburg troops, under &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Josias%20of%20Coburg\"&gt;Prince Josias of Coburg&lt;/a&gt;, again entered the country during the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281787%E2%80%9392%29\"&gt;Russo-Turkish-Austrian War&lt;/a&gt;, deposing &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Mavrogenes\"&gt;Nicholas Mavrogenes&lt;/a&gt; in 1789. A period of crisis followed the Ottoman recovery: Oltenia was devastated by the expeditions of &lt;a href=\"Osman%20Pazvanto%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Osman Pazvanto\u011flu&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful rebellious &lt;a href=\"pasha\"&gt;pasha&lt;/a&gt; whose raids even caused prince &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20Hangerli\"&gt;Constantine Hangerli&lt;/a&gt; to lose his life on suspicion of treason (1799), and &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Mourousis\"&gt;Alexander Mourousis&lt;/a&gt; to renounce his throne (1801). In 1806, the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281806%E2%80%9312%29\"&gt;Russo-Turkish War of 1806\u201312&lt;/a&gt; was partly instigated by the &lt;a href=\"Sublime%20Porte\"&gt;Porte&lt;/a&gt;'s deposition of &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20Ypsilantis\"&gt;Constantine Ypsilantis&lt;/a&gt; in Bucharest\u2014in tune with the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt;, it was instigated by the &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;French Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and also showed the impact of the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca (with its permissive attitude towards Russian political influence in the &lt;a href=\"Danubian%20Principalities\"&gt;Danubian Principalities&lt;/a&gt;); the war brought the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Andreyevich%20Miloradovich\"&gt;Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Bucharest%20%281812%29\"&gt;Peace of Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, the rule of &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Georges%20Caradja\"&gt;Jean Georges Caradja&lt;/a&gt;, although remembered for a major &lt;a href=\"Caragea%27s%20plague\"&gt;plague epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, was notable for its cultural and industrial ventures. During the period, Wallachia increased its strategic importance for most European states interested in supervising Russian expansion; consulates were opened in Bucharest, having an indirect but major impact on Wallachian economy through the protection they extended to \"&lt;a href=\"Sudi%C8%9Bi\"&gt;Sudi\u021bi&lt;/a&gt;\" traders (who soon competed successfully against local guilds).\nFrom Wallachia to Romania.\nEarly 19th century.\nThe death of prince &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Su%C8%9Bu\"&gt;Alexander Soutzos&lt;/a&gt; in 1821, coinciding with the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Greek War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;, established a boyar &lt;a href=\"Regent\"&gt;regency&lt;/a&gt; which attempted to block the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Scarlat%20Callimachi%20%28hospodar%29\"&gt;Scarlat Callimachi&lt;/a&gt; to his throne in Bucharest. The parallel &lt;a href=\"Wallachian%20uprising%20of%201821\"&gt;uprising in Oltenia&lt;/a&gt;, carried out by the &lt;a href=\"Vladimirescu%27s%20Pandurs\"&gt;Pandur&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20Vladimirescu\"&gt;Tudor Vladimirescu&lt;/a&gt;, although aimed at overthrowing the ascendancy of &lt;a href=\"Greeks%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Greeks&lt;/a&gt;, compromised with the Greek revolutionaries in the &lt;a href=\"Filiki%20Eteria\"&gt;Filiki Eteria&lt;/a&gt; and allied itself with the regents, while seeking Russian support (see also: &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20nationalism%20under%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;).\nOn March 21, 1821, Vladimirescu entered Bucharest. For the following weeks, relations between him and his allies worsened, especially after he sought an agreement with the Ottomans; Eteria's leader &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Ypsilantis%20%281792%E2%80%931828%29\"&gt;Alexander Ypsilantis&lt;/a&gt;, who had established himself in Moldavia and, after May, in northern Wallachia, viewed the alliance as broken\u2014he had Vladimirescu executed, and faced the Ottoman intervention without Pandur or Russian backing, suffering major defeats in Bucharest and &lt;a href=\"Dr%C4%83g%C4%83%C8%99ani\"&gt;Dr\u0103g\u0103\u0219ani&lt;/a&gt; (before retreating to &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; custody in &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;). These violent events, which had seen the majority of Phanariotes siding with Ypsilantis, made &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mahmud%20II\"&gt;Mahmud II&lt;/a&gt; place the Principalities under its occupation (evicted by a request of several European powers), and sanction the end of Phanariote rules: in Wallachia, the first prince to be considered a local one after 1715 was &lt;a href=\"Grigore%20IV%20Ghica\"&gt;Grigore IV Ghica&lt;/a&gt;. Although the new system was confirmed for the rest of Wallachia's existence as a state, Ghica's rule was abruptly ended by the devastating &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%2C%201828%E2%80%931829\"&gt;Russo-Turkish War of 1828\u20131829&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 1829 &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Adrianople%20%281829%29\"&gt;Treaty of Adrianople&lt;/a&gt; placed Wallachia and Moldavia under Russian military rule, without overturning Ottoman &lt;a href=\"suzerainty\"&gt;suzerainty&lt;/a&gt;, awarding them the first common institutions and semblance of a &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Regulamentul%20Organic\"&gt;Regulamentul Organic&lt;/a&gt;). Wallachia was returned ownership of &lt;a href=\"Br%C4%83ila\"&gt;Br\u0103ila&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giurgiu\"&gt;Giurgiu&lt;/a&gt; (both of which soon developed into major trading cities on the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Turnu%20M%C4%83gurele\"&gt;Turnu M\u0103gurele&lt;/a&gt;. The treaty also allowed Moldavia and Wallachia to freely trade with countries other than the Ottoman Empire, which signalled substantial economic and urban growth, as well as improving the peasant situation. Many of the provisions had been specified by the 1826 &lt;a href=\"Akkerman%20Convention\"&gt;Akkerman Convention&lt;/a&gt; between Russia and the Ottomans, but it had never been fully implemented in the three-year interval. The duty of overseeing of the Principalities was left to Russian general &lt;a href=\"Pavel%20Kiselyov\"&gt;Pavel Kiselyov&lt;/a&gt;; this period was marked by a series of major changes, including the reestablishment of a &lt;a href=\"Wallachian%20Army\"&gt;Wallachian Army&lt;/a&gt; (1831), a &lt;a href=\"tax%20reform\"&gt;tax reform&lt;/a&gt; (which nonetheless confirmed &lt;a href=\"tax%20exemption\"&gt;tax exemption&lt;/a&gt;s for the &lt;a href=\"Privilege%20%28legal%20ethics%29\"&gt;privileged&lt;/a&gt;), as well as major urban works in Bucharest and other cities. In 1834, Wallachia's throne was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20II%20Ghica\"&gt;Alexandru II Ghica&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a move in contradiction with the Adrianople treaty, as he had not been elected by the new &lt;a href=\"Sfatul%20boieresc\"&gt;Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt;; he was removed by the suzerains in 1842 and replaced with an elected prince, &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Bibescu\"&gt;Gheorghe Bibescu&lt;/a&gt;.\n1840s\u20131850s.\nOpposition to Ghica's arbitrary and highly &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; rule, together with the rise of &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20in%20Romania\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Radicalism%20%28historical%29\"&gt;radical&lt;/a&gt; currents, was first felt with the protests voiced by Ion C\u00e2mpineanu (quickly repressed); subsequently, it became increasingly &lt;a href=\"Conspiracy%20%28political%29\"&gt;conspiratorial&lt;/a&gt;, and centered on those &lt;a href=\"Secret%20society\"&gt;secret societies&lt;/a&gt; created by young officers such as &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20B%C4%83lcescu\"&gt;Nicolae B\u0103lcescu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mitic%C4%83%20Filipescu\"&gt;Mitic\u0103 Filipescu&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Fr\u0103\u021bia\", a clandestine movement created in 1843, began planning a revolution to overthrow Bibescu and repeal \"Regulamentul Organic\" in 1848 (inspired by the &lt;a href=\"Revolutions%20of%201848\"&gt;European rebellions of the same year&lt;/a&gt;). Their pan-Wallachian \"&lt;a href=\"coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;\" was initially successful only near &lt;a href=\"Turnu%20M%C4%83gurele\"&gt;Turnu M\u0103gurele&lt;/a&gt;, where crowds cheered the \"&lt;a href=\"Islaz%20Proclamation\"&gt;Islaz Proclamation&lt;/a&gt;\" (June 9); among others, the document called for &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20%28political%29\"&gt;political freedoms&lt;/a&gt;, independence, &lt;a href=\"land%20reform\"&gt;land reform&lt;/a&gt;, and the creation of a national guard. On June 11\u201312, the movement was successful in deposing Bibescu and establishing a Provisional Government, which made \"Dreptate, Fr\u0103\u021bie\" (\"Justice, Brotherhood\") the &lt;a href=\"national%20motto\"&gt;national motto&lt;/a&gt;. Although sympathetic to the anti-Russian goals of the revolution, the Ottomans were pressured by Russia into repressing it: Ottoman troops entered Bucharest on September 13. Russian and Turkish troops, present until 1851, brought &lt;a href=\"Barbu%20Dimitrie%20%C8%98tirbei\"&gt;Barbu Dimitrie \u0218tirbei&lt;/a&gt; to the throne, during which interval most participants in the revolution were sent into exile.\nBriefly under renewed Russian occupation during the &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20War\"&gt;Crimean War&lt;/a&gt;, Wallachia and Moldavia were given a new status with a neutral &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; administration (1854\u20131856) and the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281856%29\"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt;: a tutelage shared by Ottomans and a Congress of Great Powers (Britain, France, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Piedmont-Sardinia\"&gt;Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia&lt;/a&gt;, the Austrian Empire, Prussia, and, albeit never again fully, Russia), with a \"&lt;a href=\"kaymakam\"&gt;kaymakam&lt;/a&gt;\"-led internal administration. The emerging movement for a union of the &lt;a href=\"Danubian%20Principalities\"&gt;Danubian Principalities&lt;/a&gt; (a demand first voiced in 1848, and a cause cemented by the return of revolutionary exiles) was advocated by the French and their Sardinian allies, supported by Russia and Prussia, but was rejected or suspicioned by all other overseers.\nAfter an intense campaign, a formal union was ultimately granted: nevertheless, elections for the \"&lt;a href=\"Ad%20hoc%20Divan\"&gt;Ad hoc Divan&lt;/a&gt;s\" of 1859 profited from a legal ambiguity (the text of the final agreement specified two thrones, but did not prevent any single person from simultaneously taking part in and winning elections in both Bucharest and &lt;a href=\"Ia%C8%99i\"&gt;Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20John%20Cuza\"&gt;Alexander John Cuza&lt;/a&gt;, who ran for the unionist \"&lt;a href=\"Partida%20Na%C8%9Bional%C4%83\"&gt;Partida Na\u021bional\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\", won the elections in Moldavia on January 5; Wallachia, which was expected by the unionists to carry the same vote, returned a majority of anti-unionists to its \"divan\".\nThose elected changed their allegiance after a mass protest of Bucharest crowds, and Cuza was voted prince of Wallachia on February 5 (January 24 &lt;a href=\"Adoption%20of%20the%20Gregorian%20calendar%23Adoption%20in%20Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Old Style&lt;/a&gt;), consequently confirmed as \"&lt;a href=\"Domnitor\"&gt;Domnitor&lt;/a&gt;\" of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Principalities\"&gt;United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia&lt;/a&gt; (\"of Romania\" from 1862) and &lt;a href=\"Unification%20of%20Moldavia%20and%20Wallachia\"&gt;effectively uniting both principalities&lt;/a&gt;. Internationally recognized only for the duration of his reign, the union was irreversible after the ascension of &lt;a href=\"Carol%20I%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Carol I&lt;/a&gt; in 1866 (coinciding with the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Prussian%20War\"&gt;Austro-Prussian War&lt;/a&gt;, it came at a time when Austria, the main opponent of the decision, was not in a position to intervene).\nSociety.\nSlavery.\n&lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Slavery&lt;/a&gt; () was part of the &lt;a href=\"social%20class\"&gt;social order&lt;/a&gt; from before the founding of the Principality of Wallachia, until it was &lt;a href=\"slavery%20in%20Romania\"&gt;abolished&lt;/a&gt; in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of &lt;a href=\"Roma%20minority%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt; (Gypsy) ethnicity. The very first document attesting the presence of Roma people in Wallachia dates back to 1385, and refers to the group as \"a\u021bigani\" (from the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"athinganoi\"&gt;athinganoi&lt;/a&gt;\", the origin of the Romanian term \"\u021bigani\", which is synonymous with \"Gypsy\"). Although the Romanian terms \"robie\" and \"sclavie\" appear to be synonyms, in terms of legal status, there are significant differences: \"sclavie\" was the term corresponding to the legal institution during the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20era\"&gt;Roman era&lt;/a&gt;, where slaves were considered goods instead of human beings and the owners had \"ius vitae necisque\" over them (right to end the life of the slave); while \"robie\" is the feudal institution where the slaves were legally considered human beings and they had reduced legal capacity. \nThe exact origins of slavery are not known. Slavery was a common &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20medieval%20Europe\"&gt;practice in Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; at the time, and there is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia as free people or as slaves. In the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt;, they were slaves of the state and it seems the situation was the same in &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; until their social organization was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; conquest, which would suggest that they came as slaves who had a change of 'ownership'. Historian &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Iorga\"&gt;Nicolae Iorga&lt;/a&gt; associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 &lt;a href=\"Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Mongol invasion of Europe&lt;/a&gt; and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era, the Romanians taking the Roma from the &lt;a href=\"Mongols\"&gt;Mongols&lt;/a&gt; as slaves and preserving their status. Other historians consider that they were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. While it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, the bulk of them came from south of the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 14th century, some time after the &lt;a href=\"foundation%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;foundation of Wallachia&lt;/a&gt;. The arrival of the Roma made slavery a widespread practice.\nTraditionally, Roma slaves were divided into three categories. The smallest was owned by the \"hospodars\", and went by the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian-language&lt;/a&gt; name of \"\u021bigani domne\u0219ti\" (\"Gypsies belonging to the lord\"). The two other categories comprised \"\u021bigani m\u0103n\u0103stire\u0219ti\" (\"Gypsies belonging to the monasteries\"), who were the property of &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Romanian Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Greek Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; monasteries, and \"\u021bigani boiere\u0219ti\" (\"Gypsies belonging to the boyars\"), who were enslaved by the category of landowners.\nThe abolition of slavery was carried out following a campaign by young revolutionaries who embraced the &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; ideas of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;. The earliest law which freed a category of slaves was in March 1843, which transferred the control of the state slaves owned by the prison authority to the local authorities, leading to their sedentarizing and becoming peasants. During the &lt;a href=\"Wallachian%20Revolution%20of%201848\"&gt;Wallachian Revolution of 1848&lt;/a&gt;, the agenda of the Provisional Government included the emancipation (\"dezrobire\") of the Roma as one of the main social demands. By the 1850s the movement gained support from almost the whole of Romanian society, and the law from February 1856 emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (citizens).\nGeography.\nWith an area of approximately , Wallachia is situated north of the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; (and of present-day &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;), east of &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; and south of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Carpathians\"&gt;Southern Carpathians&lt;/a&gt;, and is traditionally divided between &lt;a href=\"Muntenia\"&gt;Muntenia&lt;/a&gt; in the east (as the political center, Muntenia is often understood as being synonymous with Wallachia), and &lt;a href=\"Oltenia\"&gt;Oltenia&lt;/a&gt; (a former &lt;a href=\"Ban%20%28title%29\"&gt;banat&lt;/a&gt;) in the west. The division line between the two is the &lt;a href=\"Olt%20River\"&gt;Olt River&lt;/a&gt;.\nWallachia's traditional border with &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt; coincided with the &lt;a href=\"Milcov%20River%20%28Siret%29\"&gt;Milcov River&lt;/a&gt; for most of its length. To the east, over the Danube north-south bend, Wallachia neighbours &lt;a href=\"Dobruja\"&gt;Dobruja&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Northern%20Dobruja\"&gt;Northern Dobruja&lt;/a&gt;). Over the Carpathians, Wallachia shared a border with &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Wallachia\"&gt;Wallachian princes&lt;/a&gt; have for long held possession of areas north of the line (&lt;a href=\"Amla%C8%99\"&gt;Amla\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ciceu\"&gt;Ciceu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"F%C4%83g%C4%83ra%C8%99\"&gt;F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ha%C8%9Beg\"&gt;Ha\u021beg&lt;/a&gt;), which are generally not considered part of Wallachia proper.\nThe capital city changed over time, from &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A2mpulung\"&gt;C\u00e2mpulung&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Curtea%20de%20Arge%C8%99\"&gt;Curtea de Arge\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, then to &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2rgovi%C8%99te\"&gt;T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te&lt;/a&gt; and, after the late 17th century, to &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;.\nPopulation.\nHistorical population.\nContemporary historians estimate the population of Wallachia in the 15th century at 500,000 people. In 1859, the population of Wallachia was 2,400,921 (1,586,596 in &lt;a href=\"Muntenia\"&gt;Muntenia&lt;/a&gt; and 814,325 in &lt;a href=\"Oltenia\"&gt;Oltenia&lt;/a&gt;).\nCurrent population.\nAccording to the latest &lt;a href=\"Demographics%20of%20Romania\"&gt;2011 census&lt;/a&gt; data, the region has a total population of 8,256,532 inhabitants, distributed among the ethnic groups as follows (as per 2001 census): &lt;a href=\"Romanians\"&gt;Romanians&lt;/a&gt; (97%), &lt;a href=\"Roma%20minority%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt; (2.5%), others (0.5%).\nCities.\nThe largest cities (as per the 2011 census) in the Wallachia region are:"
