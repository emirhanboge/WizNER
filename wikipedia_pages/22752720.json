    "text": "This article lists the oldest buildings in the state of &lt;a href=\"Connecticut\"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; with Wikipedia articles. The dates of construction are based on land tax and probate records, architectural studies, &lt;a href=\"genealogy\"&gt;genealogy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dendrochronology\"&gt;dendrochronology&lt;/a&gt;. Buildings on the list should be limited to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Period\"&gt;First Period&lt;/a&gt; of American architecture (before 1725). If the exact year of construction is estimated, or the building was built in phases, the date will be listed as a range. "
