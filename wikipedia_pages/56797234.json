    "text": "The Australasia was a wooden hulled &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lake%20freighter\"&gt;Great Lakes freighter&lt;/a&gt; that served on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes\"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; between her construction in 1884 to her burning and sinking in 1896. On October 18, 1896 while loaded with &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Australasia\" sank in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Michigan\"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt; near the town of &lt;a href=\"Sevastopol%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Sevastopol&lt;/a&gt;, Door County, Wisconsin, United States, after burning off &lt;a href=\"Cana%20Island\"&gt;Cana Island&lt;/a&gt;. On July 3, 2013 the wreck of the \"Australasia\" was added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20in%20Door%20County%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe \"Australasia\" (Official number 106302) was built in 1884 in &lt;a href=\"West%20Bay%20City%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;West Bay City, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; by the shipyard owned by Captain James Davidson. She was built for the Davidson Steamship Company which was also owned by Captain Davidson. At a length of the \"Australasia\" was one of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20longest%20wooden%20ships\"&gt;largest wooden ships ever built&lt;/a&gt;; her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She was powered by a &lt;a href=\"Compound%20steam%20engine\"&gt;fore and aft compound engine&lt;/a&gt; which was fueled by two coal burning &lt;a href=\"Scotch%20marine%20boiler\"&gt;Scotch marine boiler&lt;/a&gt;s. She had a &lt;a href=\"gross%20tonnage\"&gt;gross tonnage&lt;/a&gt; of 1829.32 tons and a &lt;a href=\"net%20tonnage\"&gt;net tonnage&lt;/a&gt; of 1539.20 tons.\nOn September 17, 1884, the \"Australasia\" was launched as hull number #9. At the time of her launch the \"Australasia\" was the largest wooden-hulled ship in the world. Because of her enormous size the \"Australasia\" needed iron cross bracing, an iron &lt;a href=\"keelson\"&gt;keelson&lt;/a&gt;, iron plates, and several iron arches to increase her strength.\nShe was used to haul &lt;a href=\"bulk%20cargo\"&gt;bulk cargo&lt;/a&gt;es such as &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grain\"&gt;grain&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes &lt;a href=\"salt\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt;. She could carry these cargoes so efficiently that she earned a fortune for her owners at a time when small, less versatile wooden vessels were quickly being replaced by larger, and stronger iron or steel vessels. Just like all ships owned by Captain Davidson, the \"Australasia\" used to tow a wooden schooner barge.\nFinal voyage.\nOn October 17, 1896, the \"Australasia\" was bound from a port on &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Erie\"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, carrying 2,200 tons of &lt;a href=\"soft%20coal\"&gt;soft coal&lt;/a&gt;. At around 6:00 p.m. near &lt;a href=\"Baileys%20Harbor%20%28CDP%29%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Baileys Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, the crew of the \"Australasia\" discovered \"a fire beneath the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20%28steamboat%29\"&gt;texas&lt;/a&gt; on the main deck\". They attempted to fight the blaze but failed. The crew abandoned the \"Australasia\" before she reached &lt;a href=\"Jacksonport%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Jacksonport, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. At 10:30 p.m., the \"Australasia\" was about four hours off Jacksonport when the &lt;a href=\"tugboat\"&gt;tugboat&lt;/a&gt; \"John Leathem\" came upon the struggling steamer. The \"Leathem\" began towing the \"Australasia\" to shore, but the &lt;a href=\"Hawser\"&gt;hawser&lt;/a&gt; connecting them kept burning through. At 9:00 a.m. on October 18, 1896, the crew of the \"Leathem\" gave up trying to salvage her and instead dragged her onto the beach in of water south of Cave Point. Her crew decided to scuttle her, by ramming a hole in the \"Australasia\"&amp;apos;s side with the \"Leathem\"&amp;apos;s stem. She burned until the night of October 18, 1896.\nThe \"Australasia\" today.\nThe \"Australasia\" was declared a total loss. Much of her cargo of soft coal and machinery was salvaged, however her hull was beyond repair and was abandoned. Today her lower hull lies mostly buried in sand 15 to 20 feet of water off &lt;a href=\"Whitefish%20Dunes%20State%20Park\"&gt;Whitefish Dunes State Park&lt;/a&gt;. Because most of her hull remains buried in sand, there is the possibility that different hull sections may be uncovered which may reveal more significant information about her construction. Not a trace of her cargo is visible on the site of her wreck, but traces of coal are visible on a beach nearby. The wreck of the \"Australasia\" is rarely visited by divers which means that very little site disturbance to the site has occurred. Close by are the wrecks of several other ships including the early steel freighter &lt;a href=\"SS%20Lakeland\"&gt;\"Lakeland\"&lt;/a&gt;, the large wooden bulk carrier &lt;a href=\"Frank%20O%27Connor%20%28bulk%20carrier%29\"&gt;\"Frank O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;, the wooden steamer &lt;a href=\"SS%20Louisiana\"&gt;\"Louisiana\"&lt;/a&gt; which was lost during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20Storm%20of%201913\"&gt;Great Lakes Storm of 1913&lt;/a&gt;, the schooner &lt;a href=\"Christina%20Nilsson%20%28shipwreck%29\"&gt;\"Christina Nilsson\"&lt;/a&gt; and the steamboat &lt;a href=\"Joys%20%28shipwreck%29\"&gt;\"Joys\"&lt;/a&gt;."
