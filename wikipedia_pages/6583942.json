    "text": "The Adventuress sailing &lt;a href=\"dinghy\"&gt;dinghy&lt;/a&gt; class was designed by &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Proctor\"&gt;Ian Proctor&lt;/a&gt; and built by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20081204183740/http%3A//www.aavx76.dial.pipex.com/\"&gt;Anglo Marine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Essex\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;. It is no longer in production. \nThe Adventuress is classed as a family dinghy due to its spacious design and stable &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; made so by the unique &lt;a href=\"bilge%20keel\"&gt;bilge keel&lt;/a&gt;s. It is ideally suited for families, or less experienced sailors, or those who want a solid, easily handled, undemanding dinghy for cruising. Although larger than both, being 12.5 foot in length, the Adventuress could be compared to a &lt;a href=\"Heron%20%28dinghy%29\"&gt;Heron&lt;/a&gt; or Gull (which is also built by Anglo Marine).\nThe dinghy is 12 feet 6 inches long with a &lt;a href=\"Mast%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;mast&lt;/a&gt; just over 18 feet.\nIt is sailed with a &lt;a href=\"Mainsail\"&gt;Mainsail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jib\"&gt;Jib&lt;/a&gt; and performs very well, remaining balanced in all conditions.\nConstruction.\nThe Adventuress is constructed of &lt;a href=\"Glass-reinforced%20plastic\"&gt;GRP&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"bilge%20keel\"&gt;bilge keel&lt;/a&gt;s are formed as an integral part of the hull, and create dynamic and directional stability - they do not contain ballast. The hull and deck mouldings have inner mouldings that create built-in buoyancy tanks at bow and stern and along each side.\nThe configuration of the bow buoyancy tank creates a area for stowage space under the foredeck.\nThe deck and inner mouldings have a moulded-in non-slip pattern on the decks and side benches. The inner edge of the side deck is contoured, making the boat comfortable to sit inside, and also comfortable to the backs of the legs when sitting on or &lt;a href=\"Hiking%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;hiking out&lt;/a&gt; over the side decks.\nA marine plywood case houses the &lt;a href=\"centreboard\"&gt;centreboard&lt;/a&gt;, and it also supports the cross-thwart - which is made from solid mahogany.\nMoulded into the back is a useful locker with a marine ply hatch though not watertight.\nRig.\nThe boat is equipped with an aluminium &lt;a href=\"Mast%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;mast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boom%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;boom&lt;/a&gt; are used to set a &lt;a href=\"bermuda%20rig\"&gt;bermuda rig&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"mainsail\"&gt;mainsail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jib\"&gt;jib&lt;/a&gt;, the mainsail is also loose-footed.\nSailing.\nFor its size the Adventuress is ideal for learning or relaxed family cruising, although, given enough wind, the boat will &lt;a href=\"Planing%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; off the wind.\nDespite its size, because of its uncluttered cockpit and simple controls, the boat can accommodate up to four people while sailing."
