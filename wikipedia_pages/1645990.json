    "text": "Jacob Mincer (July 15, 1922 \u2013 August 20, 2006), was a father of modern &lt;a href=\"labor%20economics\"&gt;labor economics&lt;/a&gt;. He was &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20L.%20Buttenwieser\"&gt;Joseph L. Buttenwieser&lt;/a&gt; Professor of Economics and Social Relations at &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20University\"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; for most of his active life.\nBiography.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Tomasz%C3%B3w%20Lubelski\"&gt;Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, Mincer survived World War II &lt;a href=\"internment\"&gt;prison camps&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; as a teenager. After graduating from &lt;a href=\"Emory%20University\"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt; in 1950, Mincer received his Ph.D. from &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20University\"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; in 1957.\nFollowing teaching stints at &lt;a href=\"City%20College%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;City College of New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20University\"&gt;Hebrew University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stockholm%20School%20of%20Economics\"&gt;Stockholm School of Economics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, Mincer joined Columbia's faculty in 1959. He stayed at Columbia until his retirement in 1991.\nMincer was also a member of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Research\"&gt;National Bureau of Economic Research&lt;/a&gt; from 1960 through his death.\nMincer died at his &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; home on August 20, 2006, due to complications from &lt;a href=\"Parkinson%27s%20disease\"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, according to his wife, Dr. Flora Mincer, and his daughters, Deborah Mincer (Sussman) and Carolyn Mincer.\nContributions to economic science.\nMincer was considered by many to be a father of modern &lt;a href=\"labor%20economics\"&gt;labor economics&lt;/a&gt;. As a leading member of a group of economists known as the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20School%20of%20Economics\"&gt;Chicago School of Economics&lt;/a&gt;, Mincer and Nobel Laureate &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Becker\"&gt;Gary Becker&lt;/a&gt; helped to develop the empirical foundations of &lt;a href=\"human%20capital\"&gt;human capital&lt;/a&gt; theory, consequently revolutionizing the field of labor economics.\nDuring his academic career, Mincer authored four books and hundreds of journal articles, papers and essays. Mincer's ground-breaking work: \"Schooling, Experience and Earnings\", published in 1974, used data from the 1950 and 1960 Censuses to relate income distribution in America to the varying amounts of education and on-the-job training among workers. \"He calculated, for example, that annual earnings rose by 5 to 10 percent in the 1950s and 1960s for every year of additional schooling. There was a similar, although smaller, return on investment in job training\u2014and age played a role.\"\nMincer's work continues to have a profound impact on the field of labor economics. Papers in the field frequently use &lt;a href=\"Mincerian%20equations\"&gt;Mincerian equations&lt;/a&gt;, which model wages as a function of &lt;a href=\"human%20capital\"&gt;human capital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"statistical%20estimation\"&gt;statistical estimation&lt;/a&gt;. And as a result of Mincer's pioneering work, variables such as schooling and work experience are now the most commonly used measures of human capital.\nAwards and prizes.\nIn 1967 Mincer was elected as a &lt;a href=\"Fellow%20of%20the%20American%20Statistical%20Association\"&gt;Fellow of the American Statistical Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1991, he received an &lt;a href=\"honorary%20degree\"&gt;honorary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Laws\"&gt;Doctor of Laws&lt;/a&gt; degree from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt; which recognized his seminal work in the economic analysis of earnings and &lt;a href=\"Economic%20inequality\"&gt;inequality&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"labor%20force\"&gt;labor force&lt;/a&gt; decisions of women and of &lt;a href=\"Job%20%28role%29\"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; mobility. The citation for the degree also recognized Mincer's work in this area that has helped guide a generation of economists who study these important social questions.\nIn recognition of his lifetime achievements in economics, Mincer was awarded the first &lt;a href=\"Institute%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Labor%23IZA%20Prize%20in%20Labor%20Economics\"&gt;IZA Prize in Labor Economics&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Institute%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Labor\"&gt;Institute for the Study of Labor&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bonn\"&gt;Bonn&lt;/a&gt;, Germany). The $50,000 prize was presented to Mincer by more than 100 of his former students and colleagues at a conference at Columbia University in 2002.\nIn 2004 Mincer received a Career Achievement Award from the Society of Labor Economists; the annual award has subsequently become known as the &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20Mincer%20Award\"&gt;Mincer Award&lt;/a&gt;.\nMincer was never awarded a &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Economics\"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;, though he was considered one of the world's greatest economists of the 20th century, and was nominated for the award numerous times by admiring colleagues."
