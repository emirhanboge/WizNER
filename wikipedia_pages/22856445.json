    "text": "Cyanixia is a genus of plants in the &lt;a href=\"Iridaceae\"&gt;Iridaceae&lt;/a&gt;, first described in 2003. It contains only one known species, Cyanixia socotrana, a &lt;a href=\"perennial\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"herbaceous\"&gt;herbaceous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bulb\"&gt;bulbous plant&lt;/a&gt; species &lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to the Island of &lt;a href=\"Socotra\"&gt;Socotra&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Yemen\"&gt;Republic of Yemen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe genus name is derived from &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; words \"Ixia\", referring to the radially symmetrical flowers in the genus of that name, as well as \"cyanos\", meaning \"blue\". The species was for many years considered a member of the South African genus \"&lt;a href=\"Babiana\"&gt;Babiana&lt;/a&gt;\" but recognized as a distinct genus in 2003."
