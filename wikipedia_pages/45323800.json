In 1892 Canon Keens obtained permission from the &lt;a href=\"Archdiocese%20of%20Westminster\"&gt;Archdiocese of Westminster&lt;/a&gt; to build a church in the area. Originally, it was to be called the Church of the Most Holy Redeemer. The foundation stone was laid on 7 June 1894 and the church was opened on 23 October 1895.

The west wall and organ were destroyed. After the war, the church was repaired.\nIn 1962, the restoration work was undertaken in the church. From 1970 to 1972, the church was reordered. The floor of the &lt;a href=\"chancel\"&gt;chancel&lt;/a&gt; was relaid, so that the altar could be brought towards the congregation and a marble &lt;a href=\"Pulpit\"&gt;ambo&lt;/a&gt; was installed.
