    "text": "An artifact, or artefact (see &lt;a href=\"American%20and%20British%20English%20spelling%20differences%23Miscellaneous%20spelling%20differences\"&gt;American and British English spelling differences&lt;/a&gt;), is a general term for an item made or given shape by humans, such as a tool or a work of art, especially an object of archaeological interest. In &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt;, the word has become a term of particular nuance and is defined as an object recovered by archaeological endeavor, which may be a &lt;a href=\"cultural%20artifact\"&gt;cultural artifact&lt;/a&gt; having &lt;a href=\"archaeological%20culture\"&gt;cultural&lt;/a&gt; interest.\nArtifact is the general term used in archaeology, while in museums the equivalent general term is normally \"object\", and in &lt;a href=\"art%20history\"&gt;art history&lt;/a&gt; perhaps &lt;a href=\"artwork\"&gt;artwork&lt;/a&gt; or a more specific term such as \"carving\". The same item may be called all or any of these in different contexts, and more specific terms will be used when talking about individual objects, or groups of similar ones.\nArtifacts exist in many different forms and can sometimes be confused with &lt;a href=\"Biofact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;ecofacts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feature%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;features&lt;/a&gt;; all three of these can sometimes be found together at archaeological sites. They can also exist in different types of context depending on the processes that have acted on them over time. A wide variety of analyses take place to analyze artifacts and provide information on them. However, the process of analyzing artifacts through scientific archaeology can be hindered by the looting and collecting of artifacts, which sparks ethical debate.\nContext.\nArtefacts can come from any &lt;a href=\"archaeological%20context\"&gt;archaeological context&lt;/a&gt; or source such as:\nExamples include &lt;a href=\"stone%20tool\"&gt;stone tool&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pottery\"&gt;pottery&lt;/a&gt; vessels, metal objects such as weapons and items of personal adornment such as &lt;a href=\"buttons\"&gt;buttons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; and clothing. &lt;a href=\"Bone\"&gt;Bone&lt;/a&gt;s that show signs of human modification are also examples. Natural objects, such as fire cracked rocks from a &lt;a href=\"hearth\"&gt;hearth&lt;/a&gt; or plant material used for food, are classified by archaeologists as &lt;a href=\"ecofacts\"&gt;ecofacts&lt;/a&gt; rather than as artefacts.\nArtefacts exist as a result of &lt;a href=\"Behavioural%20Processes\"&gt;behavioural&lt;/a&gt; and transformational processes. A behavioural process involves acquiring &lt;a href=\"raw%20material\"&gt;raw material&lt;/a&gt;s, manufacturing these for a specific purpose and then discarding after use. Transformational processes begin at the end of behavioural processes; this is when the artefact is changed by nature and/or humans after is has been deposited. Both of these processes are significant factors in evaluating the &lt;a href=\"Archaeological%20context\"&gt;context&lt;/a&gt; of an artefact.\nThe context of an artefact can be broken into two categories: primary context and secondary context. A &lt;a href=\"Matrix%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;matrix&lt;/a&gt; is a physical setting within which an artefact exists, and a provenience refers to a specific location within a matrix. When an artefact is found in the realm of primary context, the matrix and provenience have not been changed by transformational processes. However, the matrix and provenience are changed by transformational processes when referring to secondary context. Artefacts exist in both contexts, and this is taken into account during the analysis of them.\nArtefacts are distinguished from stratigraphic features and ecofacts. &lt;a href=\"Stratification%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;Stratigraphic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Feature%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; are non-portable remains of human activity that include &lt;a href=\"hearth\"&gt;hearth&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"road\"&gt;road&lt;/a&gt;s, deposits, trenches and similar remains. &lt;a href=\"Biofact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;Ecofacts&lt;/a&gt;, also referred to as biofacts, are objects of archaeological interest made by other organisms, such as &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;.\nNatural objects that humans have moved but not changed are called &lt;a href=\"manuport\"&gt;manuport&lt;/a&gt;s. Examples include seashells moved inland or rounded pebbles placed away from the water action that made them.\nThese distinctions are often blurred; a bone removed from an animal carcass is a biofact but a bone carved into a useful implement is an artefact. Similarly there can be debate over early stone objects that could be either crude artefact or naturally occurring and happen to resemble early objects made by &lt;a href=\"early%20humans\"&gt;early humans&lt;/a&gt; or \"&lt;a href=\"Homo%20sapiens\"&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/a&gt;\". It can be difficult to distinguish the differences between actual man-made &lt;a href=\"Stone%20tool\"&gt;lithic&lt;/a&gt; artefact and &lt;a href=\"geofacts\"&gt;geofacts&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 naturally occurring lithics that resemble man-made tools. It is possible to authenticate artifacts by examining the general characteristics attributed to man-made tools and local characteristics of the site.\nArtefacts, features and ecofacts can all be located together at sites. Sites may include different arrangements of the three; some might include all of them while others might only include one or two. Sights can have clear boundaries in the form of walls and &lt;a href=\"moat\"&gt;moat&lt;/a&gt;s, but this is not always the case. Sites can be distinguished through categories, such as location and past functions. How artefacts exist at these sites can provide archaeological insight. An example of this would be utilising the position and depth of buried artefacts to determine a chronological timeline for past occurrences at the site.\nModern archaeologists take care to distinguish &lt;a href=\"material%20culture\"&gt;material culture&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"ethnicity\"&gt;ethnicity&lt;/a&gt;, which is often more complex, as expressed by &lt;a href=\"Carol%20Kramer\"&gt;Carol Kramer&lt;/a&gt; in the dictum \"pots are not people.\"\nAnalysis.\nArtifact analysis is determined by what type of artifact is being examined. &lt;a href=\"Lithic%20analysis\"&gt;Lithic analysis&lt;/a&gt; refers to analyzing artifacts that are created with stones and are often in the form of tools. Stone artifacts occur often throughout prehistoric times and are, therefore, a crucial aspect in answering archaeological questions about the past. On the surface, &lt;a href=\"Stone%20tool\"&gt;lithic&lt;/a&gt; artifacts can help archaeologists study how technology has developed throughout history by showing a variety of tools and manufacturing techniques from different periods of time. However, even deeper questions can be answered through this type of analysis; these questions can revolve around topics that include how societies were organized and structured in terms of socialization and the distribution of goods. The following lab techniques all contribute to the process of lithic analysis: &lt;a href=\"Petrography\"&gt;petrographic&lt;/a&gt; analysis, &lt;a href=\"neutron%20activation\"&gt;neutron activation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"x-ray%20fluorescence\"&gt;x-ray fluorescence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Particle-induced%20X-ray%20emission\"&gt;particle-induced x-ray emission&lt;/a&gt;, individual &lt;a href=\"Lithic%20flake\"&gt;flake&lt;/a&gt; analysis and &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; analysis.\nAnother type of artifact analysis is &lt;a href=\"ceramic\"&gt;ceramic&lt;/a&gt; analysis, which is based around the archaeological study of &lt;a href=\"pottery\"&gt;pottery&lt;/a&gt;. This type of analysis can help archaeologists gain information on the raw materials that were used and how they were utilized in the creation of pottery. Laboratory techniques that allow for this are mainly based around &lt;a href=\"spectroscopy\"&gt;spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt;. The different types of spectroscopy used include &lt;a href=\"Atomic%20absorption%20spectroscopy\"&gt;atomic absorption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Electrothermal-chemical%20technology\"&gt;electrothermal&lt;/a&gt; atomic absorption, &lt;a href=\"Inductively%20coupled%20plasma%20atomic%20emission%20spectroscopy\"&gt;inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"x-ray%20fluorescence\"&gt;x-ray fluorescence&lt;/a&gt;. Ceramic analysis does more than just provide information on &lt;a href=\"raw%20material\"&gt;raw material&lt;/a&gt;s and pottery production; it helps provide insight to past societies in terms of their technology, economy and social structure.\nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;l analysis exists to study artifacts in the form of animal remains. Just as with lithic artifacts, faunal remains are extremely common within the field of archaeology. Faunal analysis provides insight to trade due to animals being exchanged in different markets over time and being traded over long distances. Faunal remains can also provide information on social status, ethnic distinctions and dieting from previous &lt;a href=\"Complex%20society\"&gt;complex societies&lt;/a&gt;.\nDating artifacts and providing them with a chronological timeline is a crucial part of artifact analysis. The different types of analyses above can all assist in the process of artifact dating. The major types of dating include &lt;a href=\"relative%20dating\"&gt;relative dating&lt;/a&gt;, historical dating and &lt;a href=\"Typology%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;typology&lt;/a&gt;. Relative dating occurs when artifacts are placed in a specific order in relation to one another while historical dating occurs for periods of written evidence; relative dating was the only form of dating for prehistoric periods of time. Typology is the process that groups together artifacts that are similar in material and shape. This strategy is based around the ideas that styles of objects match certain time periods and that these styles change slowly over time.\nEthics.\nArtifact collecting and looting has sparked heavy debate in the archaeological realm. Looting in archaeological terms is when artifacts are dug up from sites and collected in private or sold before they are able to be excavated and analyzed through formal scientific archaeology. The debate is centered around the difference in beliefs between collectors and archaeologists. Archaeologists are focused on excavation, context and lab work when it comes to artifacts, while collectors are motivated by varying personal desires. This brings many to ask themselves the archaeological question, \u201cWho owns the past?\u201d\nThere are also ethical issues over the display of artifacts in museums which have been taken from other countries in questionable circumstances, for example the display of the &lt;a href=\"Elgin%20Marbles\"&gt;Parthenon (Elgin) Marbles&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Museum\"&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt;. The display of objects belonging to &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20peoples\"&gt;indigenous peoples&lt;/a&gt; of non-European countries by European museums \u2013 particularly those taken during the European conquest of Africa \u2013 has also raised ethical questions. &lt;a href=\"Pan-African\"&gt;Pan-African&lt;/a&gt; activists such as &lt;a href=\"Mwazulu%20Diyabanza\"&gt;Mwazulu Diyabanza&lt;/a&gt; and the \"Front Multi Culturel Anti-Spoliation\" (Multicultural Front Against Pillaging) have taken &lt;a href=\"direct%20action\"&gt;direct action&lt;/a&gt; against European museums, aiming to restitute items they believe to belong to Africa."
