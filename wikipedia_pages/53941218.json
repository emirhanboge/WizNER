As a board member, Chamberlaine provided advice, guidance, and recommendations to the Chief of Artillery for matters including Artillery unit task organization, personnel assignments, and equipment and weapons design, testing, acquisition, and fielding. While serving on the board, Chamberlaine also commanded an Artillery battery at Fort Monroe. After the split of the Artillery branch, Chamberlaine chose to serve with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Coast%20Artillery%20Corps\"&gt;Coast Artillery&lt;/a&gt;, and became a specialist in coastal and harbor defenses.\nWhen the Army's General Staff was created in 1906, Chamberlaine was selected to serve on it. His first General Staff assignment was as a &lt;a href=\"military%20attach%C3%A9\"&gt;military attach\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, a posting he carried out in conjunction with Brigadier General &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Pershing\"&gt;John J.

Shearer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"5th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;5th Marine Regiment&lt;/a&gt;. Chamberlaine's success during the Belleau Wood fight led to his selection as commander of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;American Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt;'s Railway Artillery Reserve, which he led during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Saint-Mihiel\"&gt;Battle of Saint-Mihiel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Meuse-Argonne%20Offensive\"&gt;Meuse-Argonne Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.
