    "text": "Helena \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir (born 12 November 1969) is an Icelandic &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; and former player. A &lt;a href=\"Striker%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;striker&lt;/a&gt; during her playing career, she is currently in her second spell as manager of the women's team at &lt;a href=\"Valur%20women%27s%20football\"&gt;Valur&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Arvalsdeild%20kvenna%20%28football%29\"&gt;\u00darvalsdeild kvenna&lt;/a&gt;. A qualified sports teacher and personal trainer outside of football, Helena grew up in the town of &lt;a href=\"Neskaupsta%C3%B0ur\"&gt;Neskaupsta\u00f0ur&lt;/a&gt; before moving to &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt; aged 11. She started her career in the youth team at &lt;a href=\"Knattspyrnuf%C3%A9lagi%C3%B0%20V%C3%ADkingur\"&gt;V\u00edkingur Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt; before joining &lt;a href=\"KR%20women%27s%20football\"&gt;KR&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 1986 and went on to score 55 goals in 64 league appearances for the club over the following five seasons. In 1992, she signed for &lt;a href=\"%C3%8D%C3%BEr%C3%B3ttabandalag%20Akraness\"&gt;\u00cdA&lt;/a&gt; and it was there that she won the first honours of her career as the side won both the &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20Women%27s%20Cup\"&gt;Icelandic Women's Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the Icelandic Women's Super Cup that year. She went on to become one of the most successful female Icelandic footballers in history, winning four league titles and six cup winners' medals during her career.\nHelena returned to KR as club captain ahead of the 1993 season and success followed as the team won their first ever \u00darvalsdeild championship, before winning the Women's Super Cup on consecutive occasions in 1994 and 1995. After missing the majority of the 1996 campaign following the birth of her son, Helena returned to playing in 1997 and helped KR to the first of three successive league titles. She continued playing until the end of the 2001 season before retiring to embark on a career in management. At the time of her retirement, she was ranked in the all-time top four for both appearances and goals in the Icelandic women's leagues.\nIn 2002, Helena undertook her first managerial appointment at Valur and guided the team to a Women's Cup success in 2003. The same year, she was hired as manager of the &lt;a href=\"Iceland%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Icelandic women's national football team&lt;/a&gt; but she was sacked after a year in charge due to the country's failure to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"2005%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship\"&gt;2005 UEFA Women's Championship&lt;/a&gt;. Helena returned to her former club KR as manager in 2005 and led the side to two Women's Cup titles during her three years in charge. After spending a year away from football, she returned to management with second-tier outfit &lt;a href=\"Selfoss%20women%27s%20football\"&gt;Selfoss&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. Her spell at the helm lasted one year before she was appointed manager of &lt;a href=\"Fimleikaf%C3%A9lag%20Hafnarfjar%C3%B0ar\"&gt;FH&lt;/a&gt; in October 2010. The Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur club won promotion to the \u00darvalsdeild at the end of the 2011 season, but Helena resigned as FH manager in July 2012 following an indifferent start to the following campaign. In September 2012, it was announced that she would return to her first managerial post at Valur for the 2013 season.\nBiography.\nHelena was born on 12 November 1969, the only daughter of \u00d3lafur Hauksson and Gu\u00f0bj\u00f6rg Svala Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. She grew up in the small town of &lt;a href=\"Neskaupsta%C3%B0ur\"&gt;Neskaupsta\u00f0ur&lt;/a&gt; on the east side of Iceland, before moving to the capital city, &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 11. She is a qualified sports teacher, having graduated from the \u00cd\u00fer\u00f3ttakennarask\u00f3li \u00cdslands in &lt;a href=\"Laugarvatn\"&gt;Laugarvatn&lt;/a&gt; in 1992. After graduation she taught at the Hagask\u00f3li in &lt;a href=\"Vesturb%C3%A6r\"&gt;Vesturb\u00e6r&lt;/a&gt; for a year and later worked at the H\u00f3labrekkusk\u00f3li in &lt;a href=\"Brei%C3%B0holt\"&gt;Brei\u00f0holt&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade. She has one son, \u00d3lafur Da\u00f0i, who was born in 1996. In 2008, she qualified as a &lt;a href=\"personal%20trainer\"&gt;personal trainer&lt;/a&gt;, before becoming a &lt;a href=\"CrossFit\"&gt;CrossFit&lt;/a&gt; trainer the following year.\nPlaying career.\nAfter playing in the youth team at &lt;a href=\"Knattspyrnuf%C3%A9lagi%C3%B0%20V%C3%ADkingur\"&gt;V\u00edkingur Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;, Helena started her senior career with &lt;a href=\"Knattspyrnuf%C3%A9lag%20Reykjav%C3%ADkur\"&gt;KR&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 1986. She progressed quickly, establishing herself as a first-team regular, and at the 1987 end-of-season awards she was named the most promising player in Icelandic women's football. She spent the first five years of her career with KR, her most prolific season for the side coming in 1991 when she scored 11 goals in 14 league matches. Following five years with KR, Helena transferred to &lt;a href=\"Akranes\"&gt;Akranes&lt;/a&gt;-based club &lt;a href=\"%C3%8D%C3%BEr%C3%B3ttabandalag%20Akraness\"&gt;\u00cdA&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the 1992 season. During her single summer with \u00cdA, Helena netted 11 times in 18 league and cup appearances as the team finished as runners-up in the 1. deild kvenna and won the &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20Women%27s%20Cup\"&gt;Icelandic Women's Cup&lt;/a&gt;, beating &lt;a href=\"Brei%C3%B0ablik%20UBK\"&gt;Brei\u00f0ablik&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20132 in the final. On 16 June 1992, she scored twice as \u00cdA beat the same club 3\u20130 in the final of the inaugural Icelandic Women's Super Cup.\nHelena rejoined KR ahead of the 1993 season. She was appointed club captain and her return to Reykjav\u00edk coincided with the club winning its first ever &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Arvalsdeild%20%28women%29\"&gt;\u00darvalsdeild kvenna&lt;/a&gt; title that summer. She scored 9 goals for KR and played all 12 league matches as the side went through the campaign undefeated to finish four points clear of runners-up Brei\u00f0ablik. During the following season, Helena netted 16 goals in 12 matches, including a five-goal haul in the 18\u20130 win against Haukar on 9 July 1994, as KR finished second in the division behind Brei\u00f0ablik. She scored seven goals in four games as KR also reached the final of the Women's Cup before losing 0\u20131 to the same club. Despite these disappointments, KR won the Women's Super Cup by defeating \u00cdA, the 1993 Women's Cup winners, 3\u20131 at the \u00c1svellir on 17 May 1994.\nThe team defended the trophy the following year, beating Brei\u00f0ablik 1\u20130 in the final. However, they performed below expectations in the league with a fourth-place finish, winning 8 of their 14 matches. Nevertheless, Helena was again the top goalscorer for KR netting 10 times in 14 appearances, one goal more than fellow striker &lt;a href=\"Olga%20F%C3%A6rseth\"&gt;Olga F\u00e6rseth&lt;/a&gt;. She missed almost the whole of the 1996 season following the birth of her son, \u00d3lafur, only returning for the final match of the \u00darvalsdeild campaign, a 5\u20130 home win over \u00cdBA. She scored the final goal of the game six minutes from time after coming on as a second-half subsitiute for &lt;a href=\"%C3%81sd%C3%ADs%20%C3%9Eorgilsd%C3%B3ttir\"&gt;\u00c1sd\u00eds \u00deorgilsd\u00f3ttir&lt;/a&gt;. Helena returned to the side full-time for the 1997 season and ended the campaign with a record of more than one goal per game as KR won all 14 of their league matches to secure their second Icelandic championship. She was also instrumental in the side regaining the Women's Super Cup the same year, scoring the team's first goal in the 3\u20131 victory against Brei\u00f0ablik on 20 September 1997.\nOver the next two years KR established themselves as the strongest club in Icelandic women's football, retaining the \u00darvalsdeild title in both the 1998 and 1999 seasons. Helena scored 12 league goals in 1998, the team's second highest scorer behind Olga F\u00e6rseth who ended the campaign with a tally of 23, before setting a career-best total of 19 goals the following season as the KR again went undefeated in the league, amassing 72 goals in only 14 matches. In 1999, the team also won the Icelandic Women's Cup for the first time in its history, defeating Brei\u00f0ablik 3\u20131 in the final at the Laugardalsv\u00f6llur, the country's national stadium, on 12 September.\nBy 2000, Helena had become less of an integral part of the KR side, only twice playing the full 90 minutes of a league match, and began to share captain duties with &lt;a href=\"Gu%C3%B0r%C3%BAn%20J%C3%B3na%20Kristj%C3%A1nsd%C3%B3ttir\"&gt;Gu\u00f0r\u00fan J\u00f3na Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir&lt;/a&gt;. The team could not retain the \u00darvalsdeild crown for a third successive season, finishing as runners-up to Brei\u00f0ablik. The following season, Helena was selected in the starting line-up for less than half of the team's matches, although she did appear in every game and scored five goals during the campaign. At the end of the summer of 2001, after a 15-year playing career, Helena retired from playing football in order to move into management. In total, she had played 193 league matches, placing her fourth in the all-time Icelandic women's league appearances list, and was the third-highest league goalscorer in the country's history with 154 league goals.\nInternational appearances.\nHelena received her first call-up to the &lt;a href=\"Iceland%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Iceland women's national football team&lt;/a&gt; in September 1987, when she was selected in the squad for the two matches against &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt; by manager &lt;a href=\"A%C3%B0alsteinn%20%C3%96rn%C3%B3lfsson\"&gt;A\u00f0alsteinn \u00d6rn\u00f3lfsson&lt;/a&gt;. She made her international debut on 4 September, playing the whole match as Iceland were beaten 5\u20130. She was also selected to start in the second match of the tour two days later as West Germany won for a second time. It was almost five years before Helena was selected to play for her country again when she was included in the squad for the &lt;a href=\"1993%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship\"&gt;1993 UEFA Women's Championship&lt;/a&gt; qualifiers against &lt;a href=\"England%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in May 1992. She was an unused substitute in the first of the two matches, but played the first hour of the goalless draw against Scotland before being replaced by &lt;a href=\"Ragna%20L%C3%B3a%20Stef%C3%A1nsd%C3%B3ttir\"&gt;Ragna L\u00f3a Stef\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir&lt;/a&gt;. Helena played once more for her country that year, featuring in the return match against England in Iceland.\nDuring the following two seasons Helena made a further three appearances for Iceland, including the &lt;a href=\"1995%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship\"&gt;1995 UEFA Women's Championship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1995%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship%20qualification\"&gt;qualifying&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"Greece%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; on 29 May 1994. Iceland topped their group to progress to the second qualifying round, in which they were drawn against England. However, Helena did not play in either the home or away fixture as England won 4\u20132 on aggregate to qualify for the final tournament. She won her eighth and final cap for Iceland more than five years later, coming on as a late substitute for &lt;a href=\"Sigr%C3%BAn%20Sigr%C3%AD%C3%B0ur%20%C3%93ttarsd%C3%B3ttir\"&gt;Sigr\u00fan Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur \u00d3ttarsd\u00f3ttir&lt;/a&gt; in the 0\u20135 defeat to Germany on 14 October 1999.\nCoaching career.\nHelena began her career as a football coach in 1989, training various KR youth teams during her time as a player at the club. During the 1996 season, she took charge of the team for both league matches against &lt;a href=\"Ungmennaf%C3%A9lagi%C3%B0%20Afturelding\"&gt;Afturelding&lt;/a&gt; in place of G\u00edsli J\u00f3n Magn\u00fasson. In October 2001, after her retirement from playing, she was hired as the manager of top-flight side &lt;a href=\"Valur%20women%27s%20football\"&gt;Valur&lt;/a&gt; for the following season. During her first year in charge, she guided the team to a third-place finish in the \u00darvalsdeild and the final of the &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20Women%27s%20Cup\"&gt;Icelandic Women's Cup&lt;/a&gt;, although they were beaten 4\u20133 by KR. On 11 February 2003, Helena was appointed manager of the &lt;a href=\"Iceland%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Icelandic women's national football team&lt;/a&gt; on a two-year contract, taking over from J\u00f6rundur \u00c1ki Sveinsson, who was leaving to coach &lt;a href=\"Brei%C3%B0ablik%20UBK\"&gt;Brei\u00f0ablik&lt;/a&gt;. She continued to coach Valur despite taking the national team job, and led the club to another third-place league finish at the end of the 2003 campaign. The team also reached the cup final for the second consecutive season and on 17 August 2003 they defeated &lt;a href=\"%C3%8DBV%20women%27s%20football\"&gt;\u00cdBV&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131 to win their ninth cup title.\nOn 4 September 2003, it was announced that Helena had quit as Valur coach to concentrate on managing the Icelandic national team, despite being asked to stay with the club. She led Iceland through the &lt;a href=\"2005%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship%20qualification\"&gt;qualification campaign&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2005%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship\"&gt;2005 UEFA Women's Championship&lt;/a&gt; as the team won four of their eight matches, including a 10\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"Poland%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, to finish third in their group. The team consequently progressed to the play-off round, where they were beaten 9\u20133 on aggregate over two legs by &lt;a href=\"Norway%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. During 2004, the side also played a number of friendly internationals, including a short two-match tour of America, during which they played against the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20women%27s%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. It was confirmed on 7 December 2004 that Helena would not continue as Iceland manager after her contract expired, with &lt;a href=\"KS%C3%8D\"&gt;KS\u00cd&lt;/a&gt; chairman &lt;a href=\"Eggert%20Magn%C3%BAsson\"&gt;Eggert Magn\u00fasson&lt;/a&gt; stating his disappointment at failing to qualify for the Euro tournament. The departure proved unpopular with supporters; in one poll of almost 1,000 fans, more than 80 per cent disagreed with the decision of the KS\u00cd.\nBefore the start of the 2005 season, Helena agreed a deal to return to her former club KR as manager of the women's team later that year in place of \u00cdris Eysteinsd\u00f3ttir, who was to take maternity leave. Helena took charge of the team on 4 August 2005, initially on a temporary basis until the end of the campaign. The same evening, she led KR to a 7\u20130 win against &lt;a href=\"Fimleikaf%C3%A9lag%20Hafnarfjar%C3%B0ar\"&gt;FH&lt;/a&gt;, although this was to be the last victory of the season as KR went on to finish in fourth place. The team was then defeated in the Women's Cup final on 10 September 2005, losing 4\u20131 to Brei\u00f0ablik. On 29 October 2005, she was appointed manager of KR on a permanent deal, signing a two-year contract with the club. She guided the side to a fourth-place finish in the \u00darvalsdeild in 2006, despite the team winning by ten or more goals on four occasions. A number of new signings were made ahead of the 2007 campaign including Edda Gar\u00f0arsd\u00f3ttir and \u00d3l\u00edna Vi\u00f0arsd\u00f3ttir, who both arrived from Brei\u00f0ablik. The team improved by two places on their previous league position, finishing as runners-up at the end of the season. KR lost only one league game in 2007, suffering a 4\u20132 defeat against eventual league winners Valur, who went through the campaign unbeaten.\nThe build-up to the 2008 campaign went well for KR. Firstly, the team won the Reykjavik Tournament after beating &lt;a href=\"Ungmennaf%C3%A9lagi%C3%B0%20Fj%C3%B6lnir\"&gt;Fj\u00f6lnir&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the final, although Helena was not present at the match. This was followed by success in the &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Icelandic League Cup&lt;/a&gt; after a 4\u20130 victory over Valur in the final. Helena stated that she hoped the cup win would provide a basis for a promising \u00darvalsdeild campaign. Two new signings, those of Iceland international players &lt;a href=\"Gu%C3%B0r%C3%BAn%20S%C3%B3ley%20Gunnarsd%C3%B3ttir\"&gt;Gu\u00f0r\u00fan S\u00f3ley Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mar%C3%ADa%20Bj%C3%B6rg%20%C3%81g%C3%BAstsd%C3%B3ttir\"&gt;Mar\u00eda Bj\u00f6rg \u00c1g\u00fastsd\u00f3ttir&lt;/a&gt;, were made during the close season and the team was tipped to be crowned Icelandic champions in 2008. However, the league season proved to be similar to the previous year as KR again finished second in the league behind Valur despite winning 16 of their 18 fixtures. On 9 September 2008, Helena announced that she would not continue to manage the team for the following season as she wished to take a year out from football.\nAfter spending the 2009 season without a club, it was announced in October of that year that Helena would take charge of 1. deild kvenna side &lt;a href=\"UMF%20Selfoss\"&gt;Selfoss&lt;/a&gt; for the 2010 campaign. The club had only joined the Icelandic women's league in 2009 and had finished third in the division during its first year in the second tier. Selfoss made 16 new signings during the close season, including former Iceland under-17 internationals Anna \u00deorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, who arrived from &lt;a href=\"Knattspyrnuf%C3%A9lagi%C3%B0%20%C3%9Er%C3%B3ttur\"&gt;\u00der\u00f3ttur&lt;/a&gt;, and An\u00edta Gu\u00f0laugsd\u00f3ttir. Helena led Selfoss to an 8\u20130 home win over &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B6ttur\"&gt;H\u00f6ttur&lt;/a&gt; in her first league match in charge and the team continued their good form, winning their first 13 games of the season. The team also reached the third round of the Icelandic Women's Cup before being knocked out by \u00darvalsdeild side FH. Selfoss won all but one of their league matches to finish second in Group B and qualify for the promotion play-offs at the end of the campaign. The play-offs consisted of two matches against \u00der\u00f3ttur, who had finished as runners-up in Group A. Selfoss lost 4\u20131 on aggregate over the two legs, drawing 1\u20131 at home before suffering a 3\u20131 defeat at the Valbjarnarv\u00f6llur.\nOn 1 October 2010, Helena was appointed manager of the women's team at &lt;a href=\"Fimleikaf%C3%A9lag%20Hafnarfjar%C3%B0ar\"&gt;FH&lt;/a&gt; for the following season. She replaced J\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r Brandsson, who had left following the club's relegation from the \u00darvalsdeild at the end of the 2010 campaign. The team began the 2011 season well with a 4\u20130 away win at \u00c1lftanes. They also performed well in the cup competition, beating both HK/V\u00edkingur and \u00cdA to reach the last 8, before being knocked out by top division side Fylkir. In June 2011, Helena was one of 35 Icelandic coaches to graduate with a UEFA A coaching license, the second highest qualification in European football. FH continued their league form, winning all 12 of their group matches to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs. In the semi-finals, FH defeated Haukar 14\u20131 on aggregate over two matches to progress to the final against Helena's former club Selfoss. On 3 September 2011, they recorded a 6\u20132 win against Selfoss to secure promotion to the \u00darvalsdeild for the 2012 season. After the match, Helena expressed her delight at winning the 1. deild, but was aware of the challenges ahead in preparing to play in a higher division. In the end of season awards, Helena was named 1. deild kvenna Manager of the Season, while four FH players were selected in the Team of the Year.\nAhead of the new campaign, only one player left the club while six new signings, including Northern Irish forward &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20McFadden\"&gt;Sarah McFadden&lt;/a&gt;, arrived at the club. FH took a point from their first league match of the season, conceding a last-minute equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw against Afturelding. This was followed by a 4\u20131 win against \u00cdBV. However, the team lost five and won only one of their next six matches. On 16 July 2012, it was announced that Helena had resigned as manager of FH with the team in seventh place in the \u00darvalsdeild. Her assistant, former Iceland international &lt;a href=\"Gu%C3%B0r%C3%BAn%20J%C3%B3na%20Kristj%C3%A1nsd%C3%B3ttir\"&gt;Gu\u00f0r\u00fan J\u00f3na Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir&lt;/a&gt;, was subsequently appointed to take charge of the team on a temporary basis.\nValur announced on 19 September 2012 that Helena had agreed to return to the club for a second spell as manager for the 2013 season following the departure of Gunnar Borg\u00fe\u00f3rsson.\nOn September 4, 2016, Helena was hired as manager of \u00cdA. In July 2019, she stepped down as manager along with her assistant manager, An\u00edta L\u00edsa Svansd\u00f3ttir."
