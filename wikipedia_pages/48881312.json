    "text": "The Viktoria, formerly spelled \"Victoria\", is a German &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; trophy which was awarded to the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20German%20football%20champions\"&gt;German champions&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"1903%20German%20football%20championship\"&gt;1903&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1944%20German%20football%20championship\"&gt;1944&lt;/a&gt;. It is modelled on &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, the Roman goddess of victory, winged and flinging a wreath. Thus it is the smaller reproduction of a life size sculpture to be found in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alte%20Nationalgalerie\"&gt;Old National Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe \"Victoria\" was awarded to the &lt;a href=\"German%20Football%20Association\"&gt;German Football Association&lt;/a&gt;, the \"DFB\", in 1900 to commemorate Germany's participation in the &lt;a href=\"1900%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1900 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; which were held alongside the &lt;a href=\"Exposition%20Universelle%20%281900%29\"&gt;1900 World Fair&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally it was meant as a trophy for both the German association football and &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"German%20rugby%20union%20championship\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; but it was first awarded to the inaugural German football champions &lt;a href=\"VfB%20Leipzig\"&gt;VfB Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; on 31 May 1903. After 1903 it was annually given to the German champions except during the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; when the competition was halted. The last club to receive the trophy was &lt;a href=\"Dresdner%20SC\"&gt;Dresdner SC&lt;/a&gt; in 1944 after which it went missing in the final stages of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn post-Second World War Germany a new trophy had to be commissioned to replace the missing \"Victoria\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Meisterschale\"&gt;Meisterschale&lt;/a&gt;\", when the German championship resumed in &lt;a href=\"1948%20German%20football%20championship\"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;, which was available from &lt;a href=\"1949%20German%20football%20championship\"&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt; onwards. The trophy resurfaced after the &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt;, with its whereabouts in the time between remaining obscured, with theories ranging from the trophy being kept by the &lt;a href=\"East%20German\"&gt;East German&lt;/a&gt; government to it being hidden in a cellar in &lt;a href=\"East%20Berlin\"&gt;East Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, and was kept at the \"DFB\" headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; until it was relocated to the new &lt;a href=\"German%20football%20museum\"&gt;German football museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dortmund\"&gt;Dortmund&lt;/a&gt; in 2015."
