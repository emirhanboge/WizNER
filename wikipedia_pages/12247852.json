    "text": "Peter Vogelzang (born 11 February 1945, &lt;a href=\"Utrecht%20%28city%29\"&gt;Utrecht&lt;/a&gt;) is a Dutch businessman and member of the &lt;a href=\"board%20of%20directors\"&gt;board of directors&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Feyenoord%20Rotterdam\"&gt;Feyenoord Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;. Vogelzang worked as a director for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dutch%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Royal Dutch Football Association&lt;/a&gt; (KNVB) and is part of the board of directors of the KNVB as well. He was Chef de Mission of the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;Dutch Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2004 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt Feyenoord Vogelzang was appointed in April 2007 for a period of five months. He is the central person for all directors and board members which have a goal to restructure the club after &lt;a href=\"Jorien%20van%20den%20Herik\"&gt;Jorien van den Herik&lt;/a&gt; was forced to resign. With the appointment of Vogelzang commercial director &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Woerts\"&gt;Chris Woerts&lt;/a&gt; and Director Finance and Operations &lt;a href=\"Onno%20Jacobs\"&gt;Onno Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; can focus on more specific subjects in their jobs. Under his regime Feyenoord started two \"talent pools\" of which several talented players of the club, including &lt;a href=\"Royston%20Drenthe\"&gt;Royston Drenthe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20de%20Guzman\"&gt;Jonathan de Guzman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Bruins\"&gt;Luigi Bruins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Vlaar\"&gt;Ron Vlaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andw%C3%A9l%C3%A9%20Slory\"&gt;Andw\u00e9l\u00e9 Slory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georginio%20Wijnaldum\"&gt;Georginio Wijnaldum&lt;/a&gt; are part. Fans of the club with a lot of money, mostly directors of companies are able to invest 250,000 &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s each in the talent pool, eventually they will be awarded a total of 25% of the profit that is made out of selling the players in the talent pools. The pools were successful from the beginning and the first one was sold out within a few weeks, which resulted in the start of the second pool which also turned out to be a success. Unless financial trouble and a disappointing season for Feyenoord in which they were excluded for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, only finished 9th in the &lt;a href=\"Eredivisie\"&gt;Eredivisie&lt;/a&gt; and missed out on European football for the next season Feyenoord was able to do some surprise signings. Players like &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20van%20Bronckhorst\"&gt;Giovanni van Bronckhorst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tim%20de%20Cler\"&gt;Tim de Cler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Hofland\"&gt;Kevin Hofland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Makaay\"&gt;Roy Makaay&lt;/a&gt; (all &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;(former) Dutch internationals&lt;/a&gt;) were purchased with money that was made available out of the talent pools. Vogelzang will stay at the club until October 2007."
