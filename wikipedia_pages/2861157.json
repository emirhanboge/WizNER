    "text": "Industrial gases are the &lt;a href=\"gas\"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt;eous materials that are &lt;a href=\"Manufacturing\"&gt;manufactured&lt;/a&gt; for use in &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20sector\"&gt;industry&lt;/a&gt;. The principal gases provided are &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"argon\"&gt;argon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hydrogen\"&gt;hydrogen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"helium\"&gt;helium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"acetylene\"&gt;acetylene&lt;/a&gt;, although many other gases and mixtures are also available in gas cylinders. The industry producing these gases is also known as industrial gas, which is seen as also encompassing the supply of equipment and technology to produce and use the gases. Their production is a part of the wider &lt;a href=\"chemical%20Industry\"&gt;chemical Industry&lt;/a&gt; (where industrial gases are often seen as \"&lt;a href=\"specialty%20chemicals\"&gt;specialty chemicals&lt;/a&gt;\").\nIndustrial gases are used in a wide range of industries, which include &lt;a href=\"petroleum%20industry\"&gt;oil and gas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"petrochemicals\"&gt;petrochemicals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chemical%20industry\"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"electric%20power%20industry\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"steelmaking\"&gt;steelmaking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"metal\"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Environmentalism\"&gt;environmental protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"medicine\"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pharmaceutical%20drug\"&gt;pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"biotechnology\"&gt;biotechnology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"food%20Industry\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Water%20industry\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fertilizer\"&gt;fertilizer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20power\"&gt;nuclear power&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"electronics\"&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aerospace\"&gt;aerospace&lt;/a&gt;. Industrial gas is sold to other industrial enterprises; typically comprising large orders to &lt;a href=\"corporate\"&gt;corporate&lt;/a&gt; industrial clients, covering a size range from building a process facility or pipeline down to cylinder gas supply.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Tradesman\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; scale business is done, typically through tied &lt;a href=\"agent%20%28law%29\"&gt;local agents&lt;/a&gt; who are supplied &lt;a href=\"wholesale\"&gt;wholesale&lt;/a&gt;. This business covers the &lt;a href=\"sales\"&gt;sale&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"renting\"&gt;hire&lt;/a&gt; of gas cylinders and associated equipment to &lt;a href=\"tradesman\"&gt;tradesmen&lt;/a&gt; and occasionally the general public. This includes products such as &lt;a href=\"Tethered%20helium%20balloon\"&gt;balloon helium&lt;/a&gt;, dispensing gases for &lt;a href=\"keg\"&gt;beer kegs&lt;/a&gt;, welding gases and welding equipment, LPG and &lt;a href=\"Oxygen%20therapy\"&gt;medical oxygen&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Retail\"&gt;Retail&lt;/a&gt; sales of small scale gas supply are not confined to just the industrial gas companies or their agents. A wide variety of hand-carried small gas containers, which may be called cylinders, bottles, cartridges, capsules or canisters are available to supply LPG, butane, propane, carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide. Examples are &lt;a href=\"Whipped-cream%20charger\"&gt;Whipped-cream charger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"powerlet\"&gt;powerlet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"campingaz\"&gt;campingaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sodastream\"&gt;sodastream&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly history of gases.\n The first gas from the natural environment used by humans was almost certainly &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; when it was discovered that blowing on or fanning a fire made it burn brighter. Humans also used the &lt;a href=\"flue%20gas\"&gt;warm gases from a fire&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"smoking%20food\"&gt;smoke&lt;/a&gt; foods and &lt;a href=\"steam\"&gt;steam&lt;/a&gt; from boiling water to cook foods.\n&lt;a href=\"Carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;Carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; has been known from ancient times as the byproduct of &lt;a href=\"fermentation%20in%20food%20processing\"&gt;fermentation&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for &lt;a href=\"alcoholic%20beverage\"&gt;beverages&lt;/a&gt;, which was first documented dating from 7000\u20136600 B.C. in &lt;a href=\"Jiahu\"&gt;Jiahu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neolithic%20China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Natural%20gas\"&gt;Natural gas&lt;/a&gt; was used by the Chinese in about 500 B.C. when they discovered the potential to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo to where it was used to boil sea water. &lt;a href=\"Sulfur%20dioxide\"&gt;Sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt; was used by the Romans in winemaking as it had been discovered that burning &lt;a href=\"candles\"&gt;candles&lt;/a&gt; made of sulfur inside empty wine vessels would keep them fresh and prevent them gaining a vinegar smell.\nEarly understanding consisted of &lt;a href=\"empirical%20evidence\"&gt;empirical evidence&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"protoscience\"&gt;protoscience&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;; however with the advent of &lt;a href=\"scientific%20method\"&gt;scientific method&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"chemistry\"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, these gases became positively identified and understood.\nThe &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20chemistry\"&gt;history of chemistry&lt;/a&gt; tells us that a number of gases were identified and either discovered or first made in relatively pure form during the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt; of the 18th and 19th centuries by notable &lt;a href=\"chemists\"&gt;chemists&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"laboratories\"&gt;laboratories&lt;/a&gt;. The timeline of attributed discovery for various gases are carbon dioxide (1754), hydrogen (1766), nitrogen (1772), nitrous oxide (1772), oxygen (1773), ammonia (1774), chlorine (1774), methane (1776), hydrogen sulfide (1777), carbon monoxide (1800), hydrogen chloride (1810), acetylene (1836), helium (1868) fluorine (1886), argon (1894), krypton, neon and xenon (1898) \n and radon (1899).\nCarbon dioxide, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, oxygen, ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide and &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20manufactured%20gas\"&gt;manufactured fuel gas&lt;/a&gt; were already being used during the 19th century, and mainly had uses in &lt;a href=\"E%20number\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"refrigeration\"&gt;refrigeration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Medical%20gas%20supply\"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;, and for &lt;a href=\"fuel%20gas\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gas%20lighting\"&gt;gas lighting&lt;/a&gt;. For example, &lt;a href=\"carbonated%20water\"&gt;carbonated water&lt;/a&gt; was being made from 1772 and commercially from 1783, chlorine was first used to bleach textiles in 1785 and &lt;a href=\"nitrous%20oxide\"&gt;nitrous oxide&lt;/a&gt; was first used for dentistry anaesthesia in 1844. At this time gases were often generated for immediate use by &lt;a href=\"chemical%20reaction\"&gt;chemical reaction&lt;/a&gt;s. A notable example of a generator is &lt;a href=\"Kipps%20apparatus\"&gt;Kipps apparatus&lt;/a&gt; which was invented in 1844 and could be used to generate gases such as hydrogen, &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20sulfide\"&gt;hydrogen sulfide&lt;/a&gt;, chlorine, acetylene and carbon dioxide by simple &lt;a href=\"gas%20evolution%20reaction\"&gt;gas evolution reaction&lt;/a&gt;s. Acetylene was manufactured commercially from 1893 and acetylene generators were used from about 1898 to produce gas for &lt;a href=\"gas%20stove\"&gt;gas cooking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gas%20lighting\"&gt;gas lighting&lt;/a&gt;, however electricity took over as more practical for lighting and once LPG was produced commercially from 1912, the use of acetylene for cooking declined.\nOnce gases had been discovered and produced in modest quantities, the process of &lt;a href=\"industrialisation\"&gt;industrialisation&lt;/a&gt; spurred on &lt;a href=\"innovation\"&gt;innovation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"invention\"&gt;invention&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; to produce larger quantities of these gases. Notable developments in the industrial production of gases include the &lt;a href=\"electrolysis%20of%20water\"&gt;electrolysis of water&lt;/a&gt; to produce hydrogen (in 1869) and oxygen (from 1888), the &lt;a href=\"Brin%20process\"&gt;Brin process&lt;/a&gt; for oxygen production which was invented in the 1884, the &lt;a href=\"chloralkali%20process\"&gt;chloralkali process&lt;/a&gt; to produce chlorine in 1892 and the &lt;a href=\"Haber%20Process\"&gt;Haber Process&lt;/a&gt; to produce ammonia in 1908.\nThe development of uses in refrigeration also enabled advances in &lt;a href=\"air%20conditioning\"&gt;air conditioning&lt;/a&gt; and the liquefaction of gases. Carbon dioxide was first liquefied in 1823. The first &lt;a href=\"Vapor-compression%20refrigeration\"&gt;Vapor-compression refrigeration&lt;/a&gt; cycle using &lt;a href=\"diethyl%20ether\"&gt;ether&lt;/a&gt; was invented by &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20Perkins\"&gt;Jacob Perkins&lt;/a&gt; in 1834 and a similar cycle using &lt;a href=\"ammonia\"&gt;ammonia&lt;/a&gt; was invented in 1873 and another with sulfur dioxide in 1876. &lt;a href=\"Liquid%20oxygen\"&gt;Liquid oxygen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liquid%20nitrogen\"&gt;Liquid nitrogen&lt;/a&gt; were both first made in 1883; &lt;a href=\"Liquid%20hydrogen\"&gt;Liquid hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; was first made in 1898 and &lt;a href=\"liquid%20helium\"&gt;liquid helium&lt;/a&gt; in 1908. &lt;a href=\"Liquefied%20petroleum%20gas\"&gt;LPG&lt;/a&gt; was first made in 1910. A patent for &lt;a href=\"LNG\"&gt;LNG&lt;/a&gt; was filed in 1914 with the first commercial production in 1917.\nAlthough no one event marks the beginning of the industrial gas industry, many would take it to be the 1880s with the construction of the first high pressure &lt;a href=\"gas%20cylinder\"&gt;gas cylinder&lt;/a&gt;s. Initially cylinders were mostly used for carbon dioxide in &lt;a href=\"carbonation\"&gt;carbonation&lt;/a&gt; or dispensing of beverages. \nIn 1895 refrigeration compression cycles were further developed to enable &lt;a href=\"liquid%20air\"&gt;the liquefaction of air&lt;/a&gt;, most notably by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20von%20Linde\"&gt;Carl von Linde&lt;/a&gt; allowing larger quantities of oxygen production and in 1896 the discovery that large quantities of acetylene could be dissolved in &lt;a href=\"acetone\"&gt;acetone&lt;/a&gt; and rendered nonexplosive allowed the safe bottling of acetylene.\nA particularly important use was the development of &lt;a href=\"welding\"&gt;welding&lt;/a&gt; and metal cutting done with oxygen and acetylene from the early 1900s.\nAs production processes for other gases were developed many more gases came to be sold in cylinders without the need for a &lt;a href=\"gas%20generator\"&gt;gas generator&lt;/a&gt;.\nGas production technology.\n&lt;a href=\"Air%20separation\"&gt;Air separation&lt;/a&gt; plants &lt;a href=\"Refining\"&gt;refine&lt;/a&gt; air in a &lt;a href=\"separation%20process\"&gt;separation process&lt;/a&gt; and so allow the bulk production of &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"argon\"&gt;argon&lt;/a&gt; in addition to oxygen - these three are often also produced as &lt;a href=\"cryogenic\"&gt;cryogenic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"liquid\"&gt;liquid&lt;/a&gt;. To achieve the required low &lt;a href=\"distillation\"&gt;distillation&lt;/a&gt; temperatures, an Air Separation Unit (ASU) uses a &lt;a href=\"refrigeration%20cycle\"&gt;refrigeration cycle&lt;/a&gt; that operates by means of the &lt;a href=\"Joule%E2%80%93Thomson%20effect\"&gt;Joule\u2013Thomson effect&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn addition to the main air gases, air separation is also the only practical source for production of the &lt;a href=\"Trace%20gas\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"noble%20gases\"&gt;noble gases&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"neon\"&gt;neon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"krypton\"&gt;krypton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"xenon\"&gt;xenon&lt;/a&gt;.\nCryogenic technologies also allow the &lt;a href=\"liquefaction%20of%20gases\"&gt;liquefaction&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"LNG\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"liquid%20hydrogen\"&gt;hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"liquid%20helium\"&gt;helium&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"natural-gas%20processing\"&gt;natural-gas processing&lt;/a&gt;, cryogenic technologies are used to remove nitrogen from natural gas in a &lt;a href=\"Nitrogen%20Rejection%20Unit\"&gt;Nitrogen Rejection Unit&lt;/a&gt;; a process that can also be used to produce &lt;a href=\"helium\"&gt;helium&lt;/a&gt; from natural gas where &lt;a href=\"natural%20gas%20fields\"&gt;natural gas fields&lt;/a&gt; contain sufficient helium to make this economic. The larger industrial gas companies have often invested in extensive &lt;a href=\"patent\"&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt; libraries in all fields of their business, but particularly in cryogenics.\nThe other principal production &lt;a href=\"chemical%20engineering\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; in the industry is Reforming. &lt;a href=\"Steam%20reforming\"&gt;Steam reforming&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"chemical%20process\"&gt;chemical process&lt;/a&gt; used to convert natural gas and &lt;a href=\"steam\"&gt;steam&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"syngas\"&gt;syngas&lt;/a&gt; containing &lt;a href=\"hydrogen\"&gt;hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carbon%20monoxide\"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"byproduct\"&gt;byproduct&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Partial%20oxidation\"&gt;Partial oxidation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"autothermal%20reforming\"&gt;autothermal reforming&lt;/a&gt; are similar processes but these also require oxygen from an ASU. Synthesis gas is often a precursor to the &lt;a href=\"chemical%20synthesis\"&gt;chemical synthesis&lt;/a&gt; of ammonia or &lt;a href=\"methanol\"&gt;methanol&lt;/a&gt;. The carbon dioxide produced is an &lt;a href=\"acid%20gas\"&gt;acid gas&lt;/a&gt; and is most commonly removed by &lt;a href=\"amine%20treating\"&gt;amine treating&lt;/a&gt;. This separated carbon dioxide can potentially be &lt;a href=\"Carbon%20sequestration\"&gt;sequestrated&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"carbon%20capture%20and%20storage\"&gt;carbon capture&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Petroleum%20reservoir\"&gt;reservoir&lt;/a&gt; or used for &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20oil%20recovery\"&gt;Enhanced oil recovery&lt;/a&gt;.\nAir Separation and hydrogen reforming technologies are the cornerstone of the industrial gases industry and also form part of the technologies required for many fuel &lt;a href=\"gasification\"&gt;gasification&lt;/a&gt; ( including &lt;a href=\"Integrated%20gasification%20combined%20cycle\"&gt;IGCC&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"cogeneration\"&gt;cogeneration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fischer%E2%80%93Tropsch%20process\"&gt;Fischer-Tropsch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gas%20to%20liquids\"&gt;gas to liquids&lt;/a&gt; schemes. Hydrogen has many &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20production\"&gt;production methods&lt;/a&gt; and may be almost a &lt;a href=\"carbon%20neutral\"&gt;carbon neutral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"alternative%20fuel\"&gt;alternative fuel&lt;/a&gt; if produced by water electrolysis (assuming the electricity is produced in nuclear or other low carbon footprint power plant instead of reforming natural gas which is by far dominant method). One example of displacing the use of hydrocarbons is Orkney; see &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20economy\"&gt;hydrogen economy&lt;/a&gt; for more information on hydrogen's uses.\n&lt;a href=\"liquid%20hydrogen\"&gt;liquid hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; is used by NASA in the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle\"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"rocket%20fuel\"&gt;rocket fuel&lt;/a&gt;. \nSimpler &lt;a href=\"gas%20separation\"&gt;gas separation&lt;/a&gt; technologies, such as &lt;a href=\"membrane%20gas%20separation\"&gt;membranes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"molecular%20sieves\"&gt;molecular sieves&lt;/a&gt; used in &lt;a href=\"pressure%20swing%20adsorption\"&gt;pressure swing adsorption&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"vacuum%20swing%20adsorption\"&gt;vacuum swing adsorption&lt;/a&gt; are also used to produce low purity air gases in &lt;a href=\"nitrogen%20generators\"&gt;nitrogen generators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"oxygen%20plant\"&gt;oxygen plant&lt;/a&gt;s. Other examples producing smaller amounts of gas are &lt;a href=\"chemical%20oxygen%20generator\"&gt;chemical oxygen generator&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"oxygen%20concentrator\"&gt;oxygen concentrator&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn addition to the major gases produced by air separation and syngas reforming, the industry provides many other gases. Some gases are simply byproducts from other industries and others are sometimes bought from other larger chemical producers, refined and repackaged; although a few have their own production processes. Examples are hydrogen chloride produced by burning hydrogen in chlorine, nitrous oxide produced by &lt;a href=\"thermal%20decomposition\"&gt;thermal decomposition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ammonium%20nitrate\"&gt;ammonium nitrate&lt;/a&gt; when gently heated, &lt;a href=\"electrolysis\"&gt;electrolysis&lt;/a&gt; for the production of fluorine, chlorine and hydrogen, and electrical &lt;a href=\"corona%20discharge\"&gt;corona discharge&lt;/a&gt; to produce &lt;a href=\"ozone\"&gt;ozone&lt;/a&gt; from air or oxygen.\nRelated services and technology can be supplied such as &lt;a href=\"vacuum\"&gt;vacuum&lt;/a&gt;, which is often provided in &lt;a href=\"Medical%20gas%20supply\"&gt;hospital gas systems&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"air%20purifiers\"&gt;purified&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"compressed%20air\"&gt;compressed air&lt;/a&gt;; or &lt;a href=\"refrigeration\"&gt;refrigeration&lt;/a&gt;. Another unusual system is the &lt;a href=\"inert%20gas%20generator\"&gt;inert gas generator&lt;/a&gt;. Some industrial gas companies may also supply related &lt;a href=\"chemicals\"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, particularly liquids such as &lt;a href=\"bromine\"&gt;bromine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ethylene%20oxide\"&gt;ethylene oxide&lt;/a&gt;.\nGas distribution.\nMode of gas supply.\nMost materials that are gaseous at ambient temperature and pressure are supplied as compressed gas. A &lt;a href=\"gas%20compressor\"&gt;gas compressor&lt;/a&gt; is used to compress the gas into storage &lt;a href=\"pressure%20vessels\"&gt;pressure vessels&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"powerlet\"&gt;gas canisters&lt;/a&gt;, gas cylinders or &lt;a href=\"Compressed%20hydrogen%20tube%20trailer\"&gt;tube trailers&lt;/a&gt;) through &lt;a href=\"piping\"&gt;piping&lt;/a&gt; systems. Gas cylinders are by far the most common gas storage and large numbers are produced at a &lt;a href=\"Filling%20carousel\"&gt;\"cylinder fill\"&lt;/a&gt; facility.\nHowever not all industrial gases are supplied in the &lt;a href=\"Phase%20%28matter%29\"&gt;gaseous phase&lt;/a&gt;. A few gases are &lt;a href=\"vapor\"&gt;vapor&lt;/a&gt;s that can be liquefied at &lt;a href=\"ambient%20temperature\"&gt;ambient temperature&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"pressure\"&gt;pressure&lt;/a&gt; alone, so they can also be supplied as a liquid in an appropriate container. This &lt;a href=\"Phase%20transition\"&gt;phase change&lt;/a&gt; also makes these gases useful as ambient &lt;a href=\"refrigerants\"&gt;refrigerants&lt;/a&gt; and the most significant industrial gases with this property are &lt;a href=\"ammonia\"&gt;ammonia&lt;/a&gt; (R717), &lt;a href=\"propane\"&gt;propane&lt;/a&gt; (R290), &lt;a href=\"butane\"&gt;butane&lt;/a&gt; (R600), and &lt;a href=\"sulfur%20dioxide\"&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt; (R764). Chlorine also has this property but is too toxic, corrosive and reactive to ever have been used as a refrigerant. Some other gases exhibit this phase change if the ambient temperature is low enough; this includes &lt;a href=\"ethylene\"&gt;ethylene&lt;/a&gt; (R1150), &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; (R744), &lt;a href=\"ethane\"&gt;ethane&lt;/a&gt; (R170), &lt;a href=\"nitrous%20oxide\"&gt;nitrous oxide&lt;/a&gt; (R744A), and &lt;a href=\"sulfur%20hexafluoride\"&gt;sulfur hexafluoride&lt;/a&gt;; however, these can only be liquefied under pressure if kept below their &lt;a href=\"Critical%20point%20%28thermodynamics%29\"&gt;critical temperatures&lt;/a&gt; which are 9\u00a0\u00b0C for C2H4 ; 31\u00a0\u00b0C for CO2 ; 32\u00a0\u00b0C for C2H6 ; 36\u00a0\u00b0C for N2O ; 45\u00a0\u00b0C for SF6. All of these substances are also provided as a gas (not a vapor) at the 200 &lt;a href=\"bar%20%28unit%29\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt; pressure in a gas cylinder because that pressure is above their &lt;a href=\"Critical%20point%20%28thermodynamics%29\"&gt;critical pressure&lt;/a&gt;.\nPermanent gases (those with a critical temperature below ambient) can only be supplied as liquid if they are also cooled. All gases can potentially be used as a refrigerant around the temperatures at which they are liquid; for example nitrogen (R728) and methane (R50) are used as refrigerant at cryogenic temperatures.\nExceptionally &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; can be produced as a cold &lt;a href=\"solid\"&gt;solid&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"dry%20ice\"&gt;dry ice&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29\"&gt;sublimes&lt;/a&gt; as it warms in ambient conditions, the properties of carbon dioxide are such that it cannot be liquid at a pressure below its &lt;a href=\"triple%20point\"&gt;triple point&lt;/a&gt; of 5.1 bar.\nAcetylene is also supplied differently. Since it is so unstable and explosive, this is supplied as a gas dissolved in acetone within a &lt;a href=\"agamassan\"&gt;packing mass&lt;/a&gt; in a cylinder. Acetylene is also the only other common industrial gas that sublimes at atmospheric pressure.\nGas delivery.\nThe major industrial gases can be produced in bulk and delivered to customers by &lt;a href=\"pipeline%20transport\"&gt;pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, but can also be packaged and transported.\nMost gases are sold in &lt;a href=\"gas%20cylinder\"&gt;gas cylinder&lt;/a&gt;s and some sold as liquid in appropriate containers (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Cryogenic%20storage%20dewar\"&gt;Dewars&lt;/a&gt;) or as &lt;a href=\"bulk%20liquid\"&gt;bulk liquid&lt;/a&gt; delivered by truck. The industry originally supplied gases in cylinders to avoid the need for local gas generation; but for large customers such as &lt;a href=\"steelworks\"&gt;steelworks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"oil%20refineries\"&gt;oil refineries&lt;/a&gt;, a large gas production plant may be built nearby (typically called an \"on-site\" facility) to avoid using large numbers of cylinders &lt;a href=\"cylinder%20manifold\"&gt;manifolded together&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, an industrial gas company may supply the &lt;a href=\"chemical%20plant\"&gt;plant and equipment&lt;/a&gt; to produce the gas rather than the gas itself. An industrial gas company may also offer to act as &lt;a href=\"plant%20operator\"&gt;plant operator&lt;/a&gt; under an &lt;a href=\"Maintenance%2C%20repair%2C%20and%20operations\"&gt;operations and maintenance&lt;/a&gt; contract for a gases facility for a customer, since it usually has the experience of running such facilities for the production or handling of gases for itself.\nSome materials are dangerous to use as a gas; for example, fluorine is highly reactive and industrial chemistry requiring fluorine often uses &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20fluoride\"&gt;hydrogen fluoride&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"hydrofluoric%20acid\"&gt;hydrofluoric acid&lt;/a&gt;) instead. Another approach to overcoming gas reactivity is to generate the gas as and when required, which is done, for example, with &lt;a href=\"ozone\"&gt;ozone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe delivery options are therefore local gas generation, &lt;a href=\"Pipeline%20transport\"&gt;pipelines&lt;/a&gt;, bulk transport (&lt;a href=\"Road%20transport%23Trucking%20and%20hauling\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rail%20transport\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ship%20transport\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Bottled%20gas\"&gt;packaged gases&lt;/a&gt; in gas cylinders or other containers.\nBulk liquid gases are often transferred to end user &lt;a href=\"storage%20tank\"&gt;storage tank&lt;/a&gt;s. Gas cylinders (and liquid gas containing vessels) are often used by end users for their own small scale distribution systems. Toxic or flammable gas cylinders are often stored by end users in &lt;a href=\"gas%20cabinet\"&gt;gas cabinet&lt;/a&gt;s for protection from external fire or from any leak.\nWhat defines an industrial gas.\nIndustrial gas is a group of materials that are specifically manufactured for use in &lt;a href=\"industrial%20processes\"&gt;industry&lt;/a&gt; and are also gaseous at ambient temperature and pressure. They are &lt;a href=\"chemicals\"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt; which can be an &lt;a href=\"chemical%20element\"&gt;elemental gas&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"chemical%20compound\"&gt;chemical compound&lt;/a&gt; that is either &lt;a href=\"organic%20compound\"&gt;organic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"inorganic%20compound\"&gt;inorganic&lt;/a&gt;, and tend to be low &lt;a href=\"molecular%20weight\"&gt;molecular weight&lt;/a&gt; molecules. They could also be a &lt;a href=\"mixture\"&gt;mixture&lt;/a&gt; of individual gases. They have value as a chemical; whether as a &lt;a href=\"feedstock\"&gt;feedstock&lt;/a&gt;, in process enhancement, as a useful end product, or for a particular use; as opposed to having value as a \"simple\" &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term \u201cindustrial gases\u201d is sometimes narrowly defined as just the major gases sold, which are: nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, hydrogen, acetylene and helium. Many names are given to gases outside of this main list by the different industrial gas companies, but generally the gases fall into the categories \"specialty gases\", \u201c&lt;a href=\"Medical%20gas%20supply\"&gt;medical gases&lt;/a&gt;\u201d, \u201c&lt;a href=\"fuel%20gas\"&gt;fuel gas&lt;/a&gt;es\u201d or \u201c&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20refrigerants\"&gt;refrigerant gases&lt;/a&gt;\u201d. However gases can also be known by their uses or industries that they serve, hence \"welding gases\" or \"&lt;a href=\"breathing%20gases\"&gt;breathing gases&lt;/a&gt;\", etc.; or by their source, as in \"air gases\"; or by their mode of supply as in \"packaged gases\". The major gases might also be termed \"bulk gases\" or \"tonnage gases\".\nIn principle any gas or gas mixture sold by the \"industrial gases industry\" probably has some industrial use and might be termed an \"industrial gas\". In practice, \"industrial gases\" are likely to be a pure compound or a mixture of precise &lt;a href=\"chemical%20composition\"&gt;chemical composition&lt;/a&gt;, packaged or in small quantities, but with high &lt;a href=\"Purity%20%28gas%29\"&gt;purity&lt;/a&gt; or tailored to a specific use (e.g. &lt;a href=\"oxyacetylene\"&gt;oxyacetylene&lt;/a&gt;).\nLists of the more significant gases are listed in \"The Gases\" below.\nThere are cases when a gas is not usually termed an \"industrial gas\"; principally where the gas is \"processed\" for later use of its &lt;a href=\"calorific%20value\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; rather than \"manufactured\" for use as a chemical substance or preparation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"oil%20and%20gas\"&gt;oil and gas&lt;/a&gt; industry is seen as distinct. So, whilst it is true that natural gas is a \"gas\" used in \"industry\" - often as a fuel, sometimes as a feedstock, and in this generic sense is an \"industrial gas\"; this term is not generally used by industrial enterprises for &lt;a href=\"hydrocarbons\"&gt;hydrocarbons&lt;/a&gt; produced by the &lt;a href=\"petroleum%20industry\"&gt;petroleum industry&lt;/a&gt; directly from &lt;a href=\"natural%20resources\"&gt;natural resources&lt;/a&gt; or in an &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinery&lt;/a&gt;. Materials such as LPG and LNG are complex mixtures often without precise chemical composition that often also changes whilst stored.\nThe &lt;a href=\"petrochemical%20industry\"&gt;petrochemical industry&lt;/a&gt; is also seen as distinct. So petrochemicals (chemicals derived from &lt;a href=\"petroleum\"&gt;petroleum&lt;/a&gt;) such as &lt;a href=\"ethylene\"&gt;ethylene&lt;/a&gt; are also generally not described as \"industrial gases\".\nSometimes the chemical industry is thought of as distinct from industrial gases; so materials such as ammonia and chlorine might be considered \"&lt;a href=\"industrial%20chemical\"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt;\" (especially if supplied as a liquid) instead of or sometimes as well as \"industrial gases\".\nSmall scale gas supply of hand-carried containers is sometimes not considered to be industrial gas as the use is considered personal rather than industrial; and suppliers are not always gas specialists.\nThese demarcations are based on perceived boundaries of these industries (although in practice there is some overlap), and an exact scientific definition is difficult. To illustrate \"overlap\" between industries:\nManufactured &lt;a href=\"fuel%20gas\"&gt;fuel gas&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"town%20gas\"&gt;town gas&lt;/a&gt;) would historically have been considered an industrial gas. &lt;a href=\"Syngas\"&gt;Syngas&lt;/a&gt; is often considered to be a petrochemical; although its production is a core industrial gases technology. Similarly, projects harnessing &lt;a href=\"Landfill%20gas\"&gt;Landfill gas&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"biogas\"&gt;biogas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Waste-to-energy\"&gt;Waste-to-energy&lt;/a&gt; schemes, as well as Hydrogen Production all exhibit overlapping technologies.\nHelium is an industrial gas, even though its source is from natural gas processing.\nAny gas is likely to be considered an industrial gas if it is put in a gas cylinder (except perhaps if it is used as a fuel)\nPropane would be considered an industrial gas when used as a refrigerant, but not when used as a refrigerant in LNG production, even though this is an overlapping technology.\nGases.\nElemental gases.\nThe known &lt;a href=\"chemical%20elements\"&gt;chemical elements&lt;/a&gt; which are, or can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"natural%20resources\"&gt;natural resources&lt;/a&gt; (without &lt;a href=\"Nuclear%20transmutation\"&gt;transmutation&lt;/a&gt;) and which are gaseous are hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, plus the noble gases; and are collectively referred to by chemists as the \"elemental gases\". These elements are all &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20nuclide\"&gt;primordial&lt;/a&gt; apart from the noble gas &lt;a href=\"radon\"&gt;radon&lt;/a&gt; which is a &lt;a href=\"trace%20radioisotope\"&gt;trace radioisotope&lt;/a&gt; which occurs &lt;a href=\"natural\"&gt;natural&lt;/a&gt;ly since all isotopes are &lt;a href=\"radiogenic%20nuclide\"&gt;radiogenic nuclide&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"radioactive%20decay\"&gt;radioactive decay&lt;/a&gt;. These elements are all &lt;a href=\"nonmetals\"&gt;nonmetals&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe elements which are stable &lt;a href=\"diatomic\"&gt;two atom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"homonuclear\"&gt;homonuclear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"molecules\"&gt;molecules&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"standard%20temperature%20and%20pressure\"&gt;standard temperature and pressure&lt;/a&gt; (STP), are hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), plus the &lt;a href=\"halogens\"&gt;halogens&lt;/a&gt; fluorine (F2) and chlorine (Cl2). The &lt;a href=\"noble%20gases\"&gt;noble gases&lt;/a&gt; are all &lt;a href=\"monatomic\"&gt;monatomic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the industrial gases industry the term \"elemental gases\" (or sometimes less accurately \"molecular gases\") is used to distinguish these gases from molecules that are also &lt;a href=\"chemical%20compounds\"&gt;chemical compounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nRadon is chemically stable, but it is &lt;a href=\"radioactive\"&gt;radioactive&lt;/a&gt; and does not have a &lt;a href=\"stable%20isotope\"&gt;stable isotope&lt;/a&gt;. Its most stable &lt;a href=\"isotope\"&gt;isotope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Radon-222\"&gt;222Rn&lt;/a&gt;, has a &lt;a href=\"half-life\"&gt;half-life&lt;/a&gt; of 3.8 days. Its uses are due to its radioactivity rather than its chemistry and it requires specialist handling outside of industrial gas industry norms. It can however be produced as a by-product of &lt;a href=\"Uranium%20ore%20deposits\"&gt;uraniferous ores&lt;/a&gt; processing. Radon is a trace &lt;a href=\"naturally%20occurring%20radioactive%20material\"&gt;naturally occurring radioactive material&lt;/a&gt; (NORM) encountered in the air processed in an ASU.\nChlorine is the only elemental gas that is technically a &lt;a href=\"vapor\"&gt;vapor&lt;/a&gt; since STP is below its &lt;a href=\"Critical%20point%20%28thermodynamics%29\"&gt;critical temperature&lt;/a&gt;; whilst \n&lt;a href=\"bromine\"&gt;bromine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mercury%20%28element%29\"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt; are liquid at STP, and so their vapor exists in equilibrium with their liquid at STP.\nOther common industrial gases.\nThis list shows the other most common gases sold by industrial gas companies.\nThere are many gas mixtures possible.\nImportant liquefied gases.\nThis list shows the most important liquefied gases:\nIndustrial gas applications.\nThe uses of industrial gases are diverse.\nThe following is a small list of areas of use:"
