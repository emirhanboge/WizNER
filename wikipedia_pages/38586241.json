    "text": "Victoria \"Vicky\" Williamson (born 15 September 1993) is an elite British &lt;a href=\"bobsleigh\"&gt;bobsledder&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href=\"Track%20cycling\"&gt;track cyclist&lt;/a&gt; who specialised in the &lt;a href=\"Sprint%20%28cycling%29\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt; disciplines. In 2013, with &lt;a href=\"Becky%20James\"&gt;Rebecca James&lt;/a&gt;, she won the bronze medal in the &lt;a href=\"team%20sprint\"&gt;team sprint&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2013%20UCI%20Track%20Cycling%20World%20Championships\"&gt;World Track Cycling Championships&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nWilliamson was educated at &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20High%20School%20for%20Girls\"&gt;Norwich High School for Girls&lt;/a&gt;. At the suggestion of one of her coaches at the City of Norwich Athletic Club, she switched from &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt; to cycling in 2008. She entered the Girls4Gold programme, a group that searches for talented athletes with a potential for cycling, before being accepted into the Olympic Development Programme (ODP). She then progressed onto the elite Podium Programme two years later, and made her senior debut at the 2013 World Championships in Minsk.\nCareer.\nAt the 2011 &lt;a href=\"UCI%20Juniors%20Track%20World%20Championships\"&gt;Juniors Track World Championships&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow, she won a silver in the 500m time trial, a bronze in the sprint and came fifth in the &lt;a href=\"keirin\"&gt;keirin&lt;/a&gt;. She made her senior world debut very shortly after, and won a bronze medal with partner &lt;a href=\"Becky%20James\"&gt;Becky James&lt;/a&gt; in the team sprint at the &lt;a href=\"2013%20UCI%20Track%20Cycling%20World%20Championships\"&gt;2013 Track World Championships&lt;/a&gt; in Minsk, Belarus. Since then she continues to compete at an international level, picking up numerous medals. In 2017 she signed with Under Armour.\nCrash and marriage.\nIn January 2016 Williamson was involved in a traumatic crash with Dutch rider &lt;a href=\"Elis%20Ligtlee\"&gt;Elis Ligtlee&lt;/a&gt;, at the during an &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; sprint race at &lt;a href=\"Six%20Days%20of%20Rotterdam\"&gt;Six Days of Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt; (Zesdaagse Rotterdam). The collision with the fence resulted in Williamson suffering a broken neck and back, dislocating her pelvis and slipping a disc in her neck. Williamson's racing number burned her skin in the crash and according to her if it had become infected she would have had plastic surgery.\nWilliamson was left with a loss of feeling in her left leg, her starting leg, due to a trapped nerve but was hoping for full feeling by mid 2018. During this period she married Oliver Barnes. She hoped to complete her rehabilitation by the end of January and to race at the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;2018 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to track cycling.\n2018 saw the separation of her marriage. In late January 2019, three years after suffering career-threatening injuries, Williamson returned to competition. The now 25-year-old took part in the &lt;a href=\"GB%20Cycling%20Team\"&gt;GB Cycling Team&lt;/a&gt; for sprint events for the &lt;a href=\"2018-19%20UCI%20Track%20Cycling%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2018-19 UCI Track Cycling World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. and qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2019%20UCI%20Track%20Cycling%20World%20Championships\"&gt;2019 Track World Championships&lt;/a&gt;.\nSwitch to bobsleigh.\nIn December 2019 Williamson announced that she was switching from cycling to bobsleigh, having participated in her first training camp with the British bobsleigh team."
