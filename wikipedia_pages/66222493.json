    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Austin%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly confirmed its first cases on March 13, 2020, with the related onset of symptoms occurring as early as March 2, 2020. However, the disease may have reached the Austin area earlier. The first fatality associated with the disease was reported on March 27, 2020. , the City of Austin (which reports its data in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Travis%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Travis County&lt;/a&gt;) has reported over 50,000 cases of COVID-19, with 573 deaths associated with the disease.\nThe threat of COVID-19 prior to its confirmed arrival in the Austin area led to the issuance of a local &lt;a href=\"disaster%20declaration\"&gt;disaster declaration&lt;/a&gt; on March 6, 2020, and the cancellation of &lt;a href=\"South%20by%20Southwest\"&gt;South by Southwest&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in its history. Restrictions on gatherings and dining establishments and other mandatory protocols were issued by the municipal government and became more stringent in March 2020 following the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the ensuing rise in the disease's prevalence. &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Public%20Health\"&gt;Austin Public Health&lt;/a&gt; (APH) first reported evidence of &lt;a href=\"community%20spread\"&gt;community spread&lt;/a&gt; in the area on March 19, 2020. By the end of March 2020, a &lt;a href=\"stay-at-home%20order\"&gt;stay-at-home order&lt;/a&gt; had been issued, along with associated &lt;a href=\"social%20distancing\"&gt;social distancing&lt;/a&gt; guidelines and operations changes affecting numerous Austin businesses.\nIn June\u2013July 2020, the Austin area experienced a large increase in the spread of COVID-19, making it one of the U.S.'s most prominent hotspots for the pandemic. At one point, the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Austin\"&gt;Greater Austin&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan area had the highest positivity rate for the disease of any metropolitan area in the U.S. While restrictions remained in place in following months, cases declined after July\u00a02020 before another surge of the disease began towards the end of 2020.\nOverview.\n&lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; is a contagious &lt;a href=\"respiratory%20disease\"&gt;respiratory disease&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;a href=\"Severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome%20coronavirus%202\"&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt;. Although the first reported cases were contemporaneously confirmed in the &lt;a href=\"Wuhan\"&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hubei\"&gt;Hubei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, on December 31, 2019, a later study conducted by the Genetic Institute at the &lt;a href=\"University%20College%20London\"&gt;University College London&lt;/a&gt; indicate a possible origin as early as October\u00a02019 via &lt;a href=\"zoonosis\"&gt;zoonosis&lt;/a&gt;. The rapid spread of the virus led to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. On April\u00a016, 2020, &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Public%20Health\"&gt;Austin Public Health&lt;/a&gt; (APH) reported over a thousand cases of COVID-19 within its jurisdiction. The cumulative number of reported cases exceeded 10,000 on July\u00a01, 2020. Most of the 552\u00a0deaths confirmed so far are associated with older individuals, with 82\u00a0percent of deaths from individuals aged 60 or older. Based on 2019\u00a0mortality data, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in Travis County in 2020, behind &lt;a href=\"cancer\"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"heart%20disease\"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.\nAustin Public Health risk categories.\nOn May 13, 2020, APH unveiled a set of risk-based guidelines for behavior organized into five color-coded stages, with Stage 1 representing the lowest risk and Stage 5 representing the highest risk. More stringent measures were recommended for individuals more susceptible to the disease. Austin began at Stage 3 when the guidelines were released. The initial guidelines provided recommendations for business closures, but these were later changed to broader capacity suggestions applicable to all businesses. On May\u00a028, APH provided recommended thresholds for its stages based on 7-day average hospitalizations in the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Austin\"&gt;Greater Austin&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan area. Transition into or out of Stage 5 was recommended if 7-day average hospitalizations exceeded or decreased below 70.\nTimeline.\nInitial response and first shelter-in-place (January\u2013April 2020).\nPrior to confirmed onset.\nOn January 22, 2020, APH tweeted that it was coordinating with the &lt;a href=\"Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control\"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) and the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Texas\"&gt;State of Texas&lt;/a&gt; to monitor and respond to any local outbreaks of COVID-19. On January\u00a027, 2020, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin\"&gt;University of Texas at Austin&lt;/a&gt; began banning its students from traveling to Wuhan following recommendations from the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Department%20of%20State\"&gt;U.S. Department of State&lt;/a&gt;; at the time, there were fewer than 10\u00a0students studying abroad in China. Faculty, staff, and graduate student travel to China required committee review and authorization while undergraduate travel was prohibited. Towards the end of January\u00a02020, the &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Independent%20School%20District\"&gt;Austin Independent School District&lt;/a&gt; (Austin ISD) began &lt;a href=\"screening%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;screening&lt;/a&gt; students and staff for COVID-19, keying in on individuals with recent travel to China or presenting with a &lt;a href=\"fever\"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;. The Austin-Travis County EMS also began monitoring individuals with a susceptible travel history. APH activated its Department Operations Center in February\u00a02020 and established a five-phase COVID-19 coordination and response strategy. Although cases would not be confirmed in Austin for another 11\u00a0days, interviews between Austin Public Health officials and 70\u00a0people later testing positive for the virus found that some individuals were symptomatic as early as March\u00a02, 2020. These individuals may have been diagnosed with the &lt;a href=\"flu\"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"upper%20respiratory%20tract%20infection\"&gt;upper respiratory tract infection&lt;/a&gt; and may have contributed to an undetected spread of COVID-19 in the Austin area. On March\u00a03, 2020, APH announced that it was investigating at least one patient in Travis County for COVID-19. Some technology and social media companies, including &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Studios\"&gt;Amazon Studios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Facebook\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mashable\"&gt;Mashable&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TikTok\"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and musical artists like &lt;a href=\"Ozzy%20Osbourne\"&gt;Ozzy Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trent%20Reznor\"&gt;Trent Reznor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Atticus%20Ross\"&gt;Atticus Ross&lt;/a&gt;, began withdrawing from the Austin music and media conference &lt;a href=\"South%20by%20Southwest\"&gt;South by Southwest&lt;/a&gt; scheduled for March\u00a02020 due to COVID-19 concerns. Pressure to cancel the event increased as additional participants pulled out of the conference; a &lt;a href=\"Change.org\"&gt;Change.org&lt;/a&gt; petition calling for SXSW's cancellation amassed over 50,000\u00a0signatures. Conference organizers anticipated that SXSW would continue as planned with increased sanitation stations; Mark Escott of APH stated that there was \"no evidence\" that cancelling the event would \"make the community safer.\"\nOn March 6, 2020, Austin Mayor &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Adler%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Steve Adler&lt;/a&gt; and Travis County Judge &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Eckhardt\"&gt;Sarah Eckhardt&lt;/a&gt; declared a local &lt;a href=\"state%20of%20disaster\"&gt;state of disaster&lt;/a&gt; for the city, activating the city's Emergency Operations Plan. Adler also proscribed SXSW from proceeding, marking the first cancellation of the event in its 34-year history. Other events expecting more than 2,500\u00a0participants were also prohibited unless organizers could demonstrate the efficacy of their disease mitigation plans. The disaster declaration was made in anticipation of the city's \"Spring Festival\" season, a period in which the city hosts several events including SXSW; significant visitors were still expected from outside the city during the season despite the declaration. Austin ISD canceled its international school trips on March\u00a07, 2020. Additional events around the city were cancelled or postponed in subsequent weeks. Escott issued a control order on March\u00a011, 2020, directing &lt;a href=\"Impact%20of%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic%20on%20long-term%20care%20facilities\"&gt;long-term care facilities&lt;/a&gt; to take precautionary actions including checking the temperature of anyone entering the facility and mandatory reporting of any febrile illnesses to APH. The &lt;a href=\"Austin%20City%20Council\"&gt;Austin City Council&lt;/a&gt; voted unanimously on March\u00a012, 2020, to extend the local disaster declaration indefinitely.\nFirst confirmed cases and stay-at-home order.\nThe first presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in Austin/Travis County were reported by APH on March 13, 2020. Two of the patients lived outside of Travis County while the third was Carmel Fenves, the wife of University of Texas President &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Fenves\"&gt;Greg Fenves&lt;/a&gt;. The University of Texas at Austin, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Edwards%20University\"&gt;St. Edwards University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Community%20College\"&gt;Austin Community College&lt;/a&gt;, and Austin ISD all canceled classes on March\u00a013 in response to the developments. Community gatherings\u2014defined as public or private and indoor or outdoor events expecting at least 250\u00a0people simultaneously in a confined or enclosed space\u2014were banned in an order adopted by Adler and Eckhardt on March\u00a014, 2020, and effective between March\u00a015\u2013May\u00a01. Violations of the order were considered &lt;a href=\"misdemeanors\"&gt;misdemeanors&lt;/a&gt; subject to fines of up to $1,000 or 180\u00a0days in jail. Austin's first drive-through &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20testing%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;COVID-19 testing center&lt;/a&gt; was opened on March\u00a014. Escott issued a control order that day mandating screening and isolation procedures for all healthcare facilities, echoing the similar order for long-term care facilities issued earlier in the week. To reduce the risk of the disease at the Travis County Jail, county judges increased the approval of &lt;a href=\"bail\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt; for inmates. Adler and Eckhardt issued an order on March\u00a017, 2020, ordering the closure of bars and common dining areas at restaurants until May\u00a01. Community gatherings of 10 or more people in a confined space were also prohibited outside of spaces designated as critical facilities. Operating procedures within the &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Austin Police Department&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Fire%20Department\"&gt;Austin Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; were also changed to mitigate the spread of the disease.\nOn March 19, 2020, APH reported evidence of &lt;a href=\"community%20spread\"&gt;community spread&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19. Austin adopted the Texas Governor &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Abbott\"&gt;Greg Abbott&lt;/a&gt;'s social gathering restrictions and &lt;a href=\"social%20distancing\"&gt;social distancing&lt;/a&gt; requirements on March\u00a020, 2020, with Adler affirming in an order that \"staying home is safest.\" With hospitals facing increasing pressure from increasing pandemic-related hospitalizations and risk of viral exposure, more than 250\u00a0doctors petitioned Austin and Travis County officials to procure additional protective equipment, increase testing, and implement a mandatory lockdown. Hospitals in the Austin area barred most visitors. St. David's HealthCare began to postpone &lt;a href=\"elective%20surgery\"&gt;elective surgeries&lt;/a&gt; on March\u00a023. A &lt;a href=\"stay-at-home%20order\"&gt;stay-at-home order&lt;/a&gt; was issued on March\u00a024, 2020, directing the closure of non-essential state businesses and prohibiting gatherings of any size outside of a single household through April\u00a013, 2020. Non-essential travel was also prohibited. Violations of the order also carried the same penalties as the earlier March\u00a014 order. At a press conference announcing the order, Escott also called upon area schools to remain closed for the remainder of their terms.\nThe cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Austin and Travis County as reported by APH exceeded 100 by March\u00a025, 2020. Most cases at the time involved people younger than 40\u00a0years old. A 60-day moratorium on evictions was passed by the Austin City Council on March\u00a026, 2020, along with other loans and assistance programs. The first death in Travis County was reported on March\u00a027, 2020, involving a 70-year-old woman \"with significant underlying health conditions\" according to the APH. The Austin Parks and Recreation Department closed all park amenities on March\u00a028, 2020, aside from water fountains and restrooms. On March\u00a031, 2020, APH reported that 28\u00a0students of the University of Texas at Austin tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after returning from a &lt;a href=\"spring%20break\"&gt;spring break&lt;/a&gt; trip to &lt;a href=\"Cabo%20San%20Lucas\"&gt;Cabo San Lucas&lt;/a&gt;. A further investigation of 231\u00a0people who either took part in the trip or came into contact with those who did was conducted by the University of Texas Health Austin's COVID-19 Center, resulting in 64\u00a0patients with positive test results, of which a fifth were asymptomatic; none were hospitalized. Many of the patients lived in &lt;a href=\"West%20Campus%2C%20Austin%2C%20Texas\"&gt;West Campus&lt;/a&gt;, which Adler characterized as a COVID-19 hot spot. By April\u00a07, 2020, APH was monitoring eight COVID-19 clusters\u2014groups of closely related cases including the one associated with the Cabo San Lucas trip\u2014amid a majority of individual cases. Most of the clusters involved senior living communities. The city leased a &lt;a href=\"Crowne%20Plaza\"&gt;Crowne Plaza&lt;/a&gt; in early April for use as an isolation facility for people unable to quarantine at home, and later leased a second hotel for the same purpose in mid-April. Eckhardt reported that physical contacts had declined by roughly 64\u00a0percent in early April in the wake of the stay-at-home order. A $15\u00a0million emergency relief fund was passed by Austin City Council on April\u00a010, 2020, with families being the intended direct recipients. Three days later, the stay-at-home order was extended to May\u00a08, 2020. Facial coverings were also mandated for anyone in public over the age of 10. The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Austin and Travis County as reported by APH exceeded 1,000 by April\u00a016, 2020.\nPhased reopening (May\u2013June 2020).\nIn April\u00a02020, Governor Abbott announced the planned expiration of statewide COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, to be followed by a &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Texas%23Reopening%20efforts\"&gt;reopening&lt;/a&gt; of Texas businesses in a series of three stages of relaxed restrictions. Phase\u00a01 of the reopening plan went into effect on May\u00a01, 2020, followed by Phase\u00a02 on May\u00a018, 2020, and Phase\u00a03 on June\u00a03, 2020. The statewide loosening of restrictions was intended to supersede any contravening local policies. Although Mayor Adler and County Judge Eckhardt criticized the reopening's commencement as occurring too quickly, the local \"Stay Home, Work Safe\" order for Austin was modified to accommodate the Phase\u00a01 relaxations on May\u00a01, 2020. The modified order was later extended to the end of May in conjunction with mandatory social distancing. Some churches and restaurants began to reopen in Austin promptly once the statewide reopening plan came into effect. Though the number of new COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations in the Austin area stabilized in the weeks leading up to the reopening, APH indicated that they were anticipating a possible surge in the disease's prevalence following the reopening.\nOn May\u00a019, 2020, APH reported that it was monitoring 36\u00a0clusters of COVID-19 in Travis County workers, of which 19 were associated with the construction industry. Other clusters were identified in building cleanup and maintenance workers and health workers, among other industries. Ten days later, the stay-at-home order was extended through June\u00a015; an analysis from &lt;a href=\"Drexel%20University\"&gt;Drexel University&lt;/a&gt; estimated that the first 45\u00a0days of the order mitigated 4,988\u00a0fatalities and 45,898\u00a0hospitalizations. At the end of May\u00a02020, the number of active COVID-19 hospitalizations in the Austin metropolitan area reached 79, marking the lowest number since April\u00a028, 2020. However, the number of COVID-19 cases increased, with the 425\u00a0cases reported by APH in the final week of May\u00a02020 being the most of any week up until that point. Some city pools including &lt;a href=\"Barton%20Springs%20Pool\"&gt;Barton Springs Pool&lt;/a&gt; reopened in early June\u00a02020, concurrent with the third phase of relaxed establishment restrictions statewide.\nSecond COVID-19 wave (June\u2013August 2020).\nIn June\u00a02020, the incidence of COVID-19 cases in the Austin area increased sharply in what some local media outlets and health officials termed a \"second wave\" of the disease. Daily case counts began to set record highs for the city, with daily counts exceeding 100 for the first time on June\u00a08, 2020. Dr. Escott of APH attributed the surge to a combination of the reopening of businesses and \"an increase in risk-taking behavior\" related to social distancing and personal hygiene, with &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20Day\"&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/a&gt; events being a possible catalyst. Local &lt;a href=\"George%20Floyd%20protests\"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; in response to the &lt;a href=\"murder%20of%20George%20Floyd\"&gt;murder of George Floyd&lt;/a&gt; were also a possible contributor. By June\u00a011, 2020, over a hundred deaths in Austin were linked to COVID-19. On June\u00a014, 2020, Austin moved into Stage\u00a04 of APH's risk-based guidelines with seven-day averaged daily hospitalizations exceeding 20. In response, the active stay-at-home order was extended to August\u00a015, 2020, accompanied by the recommendations associated with the Stage\u00a04 status. Some parts of the order remained unenforceable due to state law. On June\u00a017, 2020, Mayor Adler issued an order requiring that all Austin businesses mandate masks for their workers and customers in most circumstances.\nAn analysis from &lt;a href=\"Evercore\"&gt;Evercore&lt;/a&gt; using data from &lt;a href=\"Johns%20Hopkins%20University\"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt; on June\u00a018, 2020, determined that the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Austin\"&gt;Greater Austin&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan area was experiencing the fifth-fastest increase in COVID-19 cases among U.S. metropolitan areas, with a &lt;a href=\"doubling%20time\"&gt;doubling time&lt;/a&gt; of approximately 16\u00a0days. On the same day, Adler issued an order requiring businesses to mandate face coverings for employees and visitors. Between June\u00a019\u201321, the city reported three consecutive record-high COVID-19 case confirmations, with 506 on the third day. This uptick in cases was also reflected statewide, leading Governor Abbott to pause the state's reopening plan on June\u00a025, 2020. The &lt;a href=\"White%20House%20Coronavirus%20Task%20Force\"&gt;White House Coronavirus Task Force&lt;/a&gt; on June\u00a030, 2020, presented a graphic showing the Austin metropolitan area as having the highest seven-day average rate of positive COVID-19 tests in the country. At the time, the positivity rate was roughly 22\u00a0percent.\nThe cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Austin and Travis County as reported by APH exceeded 10,000 by July\u00a01, 2020. APH modelling showed that area hospital capacity would be exceeded by mid-July if the spread of COVID-19 was not curtailed. Various festivities planned for &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Independence Day&lt;/a&gt; were canceled, including the &lt;a href=\"Auditorium%20Shores\"&gt;Auditorium Shores&lt;/a&gt; fireworks show and Austin Symphony concert. All Travis County parks were also closed for Independence Day and on surrounding days. On July\u00a08, 2020, APH reported 753 new cases of COVID-19 in the Austin area, marking the highest single-day case total in 2020. The 7-day moving average of COVID-19 hospitalizations also reached a peak of 75.1 on July\u00a08. The severity of the pandemic at the time led city officials to draft plans for a possible 35-day shutdown of the city with indicators nearing Stage\u00a05: the most severe tier on the APH's policy recommendation scale. A subsequent decline in hospitalizations led APH to maintain its Stage\u00a04 guidelines, opting not to recommend a city shutdown. On July\u00a014, 2020, in his capacity as the interim Austin\u2013Travis County Health Authority, Escott issued an order outlining individual behavior rules and instituting restrictions on schools. The rules included circumstances for mandatory mask wearing, social distancing rules, and limitations on school functions. These emergency rules were set to expire on November\u00a012, 2020.\nSchools reopen (August\u2013October 2020).\nFollowing the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases towards the end of June\u00a02020 and beginning of July\u00a02020, case counts began to plateau at approximately 500\u00a0new cases per day before declining towards the end of July\u00a02020. The numbers of new cases and hospitalizations declined steadily, with Escott reporting a 12 consecutive days of improving COVID-19 metrics as the city's SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate fell below 10\u00a0percent by July\u00a028, 2020. The number of active cases in Travis County was also at one point less than the less populated and neighboring &lt;a href=\"Hays%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Hays County&lt;/a&gt;. The decline in cases slowed entering August\u00a02020 and was followed by a slight upward trend in cases, including an increase in cases and hospitalizations among people aged 10\u201319\u00a0years old. The number of hospitalizations overall held steady early in the month. On August\u00a05, 2020, the Travis County Commissioners Court approved the expansion of the Health Authority's emergency rules to unincorporated areas with violations subject to fines of up to $500. On August\u00a014, 2020, the City of Austin extended its face covering, social distancing, and gathering restrictions\u2014now collectively part of the Stay Home, Mask and Otherwise Be Safe Order\u2014through December\u00a015, 2020. New guidelines were also released for schools anticipating classes in the autumn of\u00a02020.\nA sustained lowering of positivity rates and COVID-19 cases in August\u00a02020 led APH to lower their risk-based guidelines to Stage\u00a03 for the first time since June\u00a02020, allowing for a relaxation of restrictions. The University of Texas at Austin started its fall\u00a02020 term on August\u00a026, 2020, with some classes offering in-person instruction for the first time since March\u00a030, 2020. Austin ISD schools began classes on September\u00a08, 2020, under entirely remote instruction until October\u00a06, 2020. Schools began to report new cases of COVID-19 following the start of classes, though overall tallies remained lower than the spike in June and July\u00a02020. Seven-day moving average COVID-19 hospitalizations in mid-September\u00a02020 fell to their lowest values since early June\u00a02020. Daily case counts fluctuated in September\u00a02020, though anomalous increases of COVID-19 prevalence among people aged 10\u201329\u00a0years old led to an 83\u00a0percent increase in cases overall in mid-September. The college-aged cohort had a positivity rate of 10\u00a0percent while the high-school-aged cohort had a positivity rate of 14\u00a0percent, respectively more than double and triple the community positivity rate for COVID-19; Escott, the APH Interim Health Authority, stated that these increases were driven by social gatherings and extracurricular activities rather than classroom instruction. On October\u00a05, 2020, Austin ISD began allowing in-person instruction at it schools up to 25\u00a0percent capacity, making the school district one of the last to do so in the region.\nIn early October\u00a02020, COVID-19 hospitalizations in the Austin area were at their lowest since April\u00a02020. Modelling from the University of Texas at one point projected that COVID-19 indicators would drop to Stage\u00a02 levels on the APH's scale. According to Escott, October\u00a04, 2020, marked a low point in the number of new COVID-19 cases following the surge during the preceding summer. However, hospitalizations began to increase by mid-October\u00a02020, and on October\u00a021 were at their highest levels since late August\u00a02020. Escott reported that there was a 96\u00a0percent chance that the spread of the disease was increasing in the county and that further increases and a return to Stage\u00a04 restrictions was possible in the ensuing weeks.\nHoliday season resurgence (November 2020\u2013January 2021).\nFollowing rises in ventilator and &lt;a href=\"intensive%20care%20unit\"&gt;intensive care unit&lt;/a&gt; usage as well as hospitalizations overall in October\u00a02020, modelling from the University of Texas of Austin indicated a possible increase in the prevalence of COVID-19 towards &lt;a href=\"Thanksgiving\"&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt;. One projection gave a 96\u00a0percent likelihood of an increase in cases, with the caseload increasing by 257\u00a0percent. APH officials warned that this possible surge in cases could be larger than the June\u2013July\u00a02020 surge. A decline in hospital admissions in late October tempered these initial forecasts, but still pointed towards a worsening of the pandemic in the coming months continuing past Christmas. By October\u00a030, 2020, Austin's municipal government had spent $449.9\u00a0million in its response to the pandemic. At the start of November\u00a02020, APH stated that key indicators regarding COVID-19 had either stabilized or improved from the preceding week. However, cases increased again thereafter, and on November\u00a05, 2020, APH reported that the number of active cases of the virus was at its highest since August\u00a015, 2020, with more than half of cases involving adults between the ages of 20\u201339. APH Interim Health Authority Escott said he believed that the increase was due to a rise in risky behaviors following &lt;a href=\"pandemic%20fatigue\"&gt;pandemic fatigue&lt;/a&gt;; Escott would later extend the emergency behavior rules through the end of 2020.\nBy November\u00a09, 2020, the number of new cases in Austin had doubled relative to early October\u00a02020. Hospitalizations also reached levels unseen since August\u00a02020, and indicators broadly became reminiscent of the summer\u00a02020 wave. Escott recommended that the city move into Stage\u00a04 restrictions as the number of new COVID-19 cases continued to double; the city formally moved into Stage\u00a04 two days later. City officials encouraged residents not to congregate with people beyond their households for Thanksgiving, and to avoid shopping in-person for &lt;a href=\"Black%20Friday%20%28shopping%29\"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Mayor Adler was criticized for hosting a wedding reception in Downtown Austin and vacationing in Cabo San Lucas despite urging people to stay home. An anticipated rise in cases following Thanksgiving began to materialize in mid-December\u00a02020 during a period that APH called a \"stage of widespread community exposure\". The Stay Home, Mask and Otherwise Be Safe order was extended through February\u00a016, 2021, as the pandemic worsened. The emergency Health Authority rules were also extended through April\u00a015, 2021. On December\u00a023, 2020, the city formally moved into Stage\u00a05 of the APH's coronavirus guidelines, marking the first time that the city reached the most severe category. Though no new regulations were implemented, an order was issued outlining strong behavioral recommendations in conjunction with the Stage\u00a05 guidelines.\nThe City of Austin issued a halt on dine-in service at restaurants and bars between 10:30\u00a0p.m. on December\u00a031, 2020, and 6:00\u00a0a.m. January\u00a01, 2021, including part of &lt;a href=\"New%20Year%27s%20Eve\"&gt;New Year's Eve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Year%27s%20Day\"&gt;New Year's Day&lt;/a&gt;. Violations of the order were subject to a $1,000\u00a0fine. Governor Abbott asserted on &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the local directive was not allowed under his statewide orders. Mayor Adler responded by stating that the order was an operational restraint that did not violate Abbott's orders. Texas Attorney General &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Paxton\"&gt;Ken Paxton&lt;/a&gt; filed suit against the City of Austin and Travis County on December\u00a030, 2020, over the legality of the local ordinance. The &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;Texas Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; enjoined enforcement of the ordinance, granting Paxton's petition for &lt;a href=\"writ%20of%20mandamus\"&gt;writ of mandamus&lt;/a&gt; and preventing Austin from carrying out the restrictions.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20therapy\"&gt;infusion center&lt;/a&gt; was opened in Austin in early January\u00a02021 to treat symptomatic COVID-19 patients. By January\u00a04, 2021, the seven-day moving average of COVID-19 hospitalizations\u201476.6\u00a0patients\u2014was at its highest since the beginning of the pandemic. Three days later, APH reported 879 new cases of COVID-19, setting a daily record and surpassing any daily report from the summer of 2020. On January\u00a010, 2021, the seven-day average proportion of hospitalizations in the region attributable to COVID-19 exceeded 15\u00a0percent, automatically triggering a restriction of businesses and retail capacities to 50\u00a0percent. In response to area hospitals nearing capacity, the &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Convention%20Center\"&gt;Austin Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; opened as a field hospital with 25\u00a0beds on January\u00a012, 2021. Escott stated the next day that he believed the increased caseload and positivity rates was due to the spread of a &lt;a href=\"Variant%20of%20Concern%20202012/01\"&gt;new contagious variant of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; in the Austin area. In mid-January\u00a02021, COVID-19 positivity rates at Austin schools exceeded WHO recommendations, with middle schools reporting a 27.1\u00a0percent positivity rate and high schools reporting a 20.2\u00a0percent positivity rate.\nFirst vaccines administered.\nVaccinations for COVID-19 in Austin followed the phased approach established by the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Department%20of%20State%20Health%20Services\"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt; (DSHS), which began with vaccine administration to care providers as part of phase 1A and the elderly and those with chronic medical conditions as part of phase 1B. APH announced on December\u00a04, 2020, that it would receive 13,650\u00a0initial doses of the &lt;a href=\"Pfizer%E2%80%93BioNTech%20COVID-19%20vaccine\"&gt;Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; as part of a first wave of inoculations. &lt;a href=\"Dell%20Medical%20School\"&gt;Dell Medical School&lt;/a&gt; received 2,925\u00a0doses of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December\u00a014, 2020, marking the first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines to Austin. Healthcare workers at the University of Texas directly working with patients were prioritized to receive the vaccines first; the first vaccines were administered on December\u00a015, 2020. Vulnerable Austin ISD staff began receiving vaccine doses on January\u00a02, 2021. APH opened a pre-registration system for COVID-19 vaccines on January\u00a013, 2021, which was met with high demand.\nEffects.\nIn April\u00a02020, 138,000\u00a0Austin residents were without a job, reflecting a 12.2\u00a0percent &lt;a href=\"unemployment%20rate\"&gt;unemployment rate&lt;/a&gt;; this was the highest unemployment rate recorded in the city since recordkeeping began in 1990; the previous highest was 7.8\u00a0percent in July\u00a02009. Nearly half of the job losses between March and April\u00a02020 were from bars, restaurants, and hotels. Recovery of the hospitality sector was expected to be slow due to the cancellation of high-profile tourist-attracting events. Tom Noonan, the president and CEO of Visit Austin, estimated that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism in the spring of 2020 was nine times worse than the &lt;a href=\"September%2011%20attacks\"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Austin-Bergstrom%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Austin-Bergstrom International Airport&lt;/a&gt; saw a 96.6\u00a0percent decrease in passenger departures in April\u00a02020 relative to April\u00a02019, with the same metric down 36\u00a0percent over the first four months of 2020 compared to the first four months of 2019. Hotel occupancy in Austin bottomed out at roughly 20\u00a0percent in mid-April\u00a02020 before recovering to 45\u00a0percent by June\u00a02020. Austin-area real estate saw a 21.6\u00a0percent decline in the sale of condominiums, single-family homes, and townhouses in April\u00a02020 across five central Texas counties including Travis County, accompanied by declines in pending sales and active real estate listings. Austin's industry sector, including retail stores, lost 14,000\u00a0jobs between March and April\u00a02020, while the education and health services sector lost 19,300\u00a0jobs in the same period. Austin's &lt;a href=\"Creative%20economy%20%28economic%20system%29\"&gt;creative sector&lt;/a&gt; was among the hardest-hit in the U.S. A study from the &lt;a href=\"Brookings%20Institution\"&gt;Brookings Institution&lt;/a&gt; in August\u00a02020 estimated that creative industries in Austin lost 28,852\u00a0jobs (32.6\u00a0percent of creative jobs) and $1.26\u00a0million (9.2\u00a0percent of creative sales) in sales between April and July\u00a02020.\nAlthough restaurants were considered essential businesses, safety regulations prompted by the pandemic nonetheless disrupted their operation, implementing capacity limitations and changes to service protocols. Indoor dining was either prohibited or heavily restricted during the pandemic, forcing transitions to &lt;a href=\"take-out\"&gt;take-out&lt;/a&gt; dining; the first closures of restaurants and bars began on March\u00a017, 2020, following restaurant shutdowns imposed by the City of Austin. This initial mandated closure of restaurant dining rooms and bars lasted until May\u00a01, 2020. The pandemic led to permanent closures of Austin businesses, including some longstanding establishments. In July\u00a02020, a &lt;a href=\"Yelp\"&gt;Yelp&lt;/a&gt; data showed the temporary or permanent closure of 1,449\u00a0businesses in the Austin metropolitan area, ranking the region 14th in the U.S. in terms of business closures. Of these, 155\u00a0restaurants and 72\u00a0retail vendors closed permanently between March\u00a01 and July\u00a010. By September\u00a030, 2020, the City of Austin &lt;a href=\"3-1-1\"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; nearly 7,000\u00a0complaints of COVID-19 safety violations at businesses and had issued &lt;a href=\"citation%20%28police%29\"&gt;citations&lt;/a&gt; to at least 8\u00a0businesses. Some bars in Austin had their operating licenses suspended after the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Alcoholic%20Beverage%20Commission\"&gt;Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission&lt;/a&gt; began enforcing COVID-19 safety rules in June\u00a02020. Health and fitness venues including gyms, pools, and rock climbing centers were also closed during the pandemic.\nRisk of viral spread led to pedagogical changes at Austin schools, including both changes to instruction modes and academic calendars. On March\u00a013, 2020, &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Community%20College\"&gt;Austin Community College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Concordia%20University\"&gt;Concordia University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Edwards%20University\"&gt;St. Edwards University&lt;/a&gt;, and the University of Texas canceled classes and operations for the day; each institution was set to begin spring break the following week. Austin ISD also canceled its classes and closed its offices for the day. The University of Texas extended its spring break in 2020 by one week through March\u00a027. Classes there began transitioning to online teaching on March\u00a030, 2020, and all classes were maintained online through the school's summer semester. Concordia University, &lt;a href=\"Huston%E2%80%93Tillotson%20University\"&gt;Huston\u2013Tillotson University&lt;/a&gt;, and St. Edward's University also moved classes online for the rest of the semester, and many closed their on-campus residences and eased their grading policies. Austin ISD's schools closed indefinitely in spring\u00a02020 as instruction moved entirely online. For the fall\u00a02020 semester, Austin ISD continued online instruction but began opening its schools and offering limited in-person instruction in October. Austin-area colleges and universities offered a mix of both online and in-person instruction for the fall.\nWith more people saying at home during the pandemic, utility bills increased in tandem with a rise in residential electricity usage throughout Austin. Industrial and commercial energy usage was expected to decrease. The Austin City Council approved $46\u00a0million in emergency relief for electric and water bills in April\u00a02020 through October\u00a02020. Austin's homeless population increased by 11\u00a0percent according to a May\u00a02020 city report, but without a clear causal link to the pandemic. However, business closures associated with the pandemic in Downtown Austin may have led to a broad movement of the homeless population away from he downtown area. A decrease in arrests occurred concurrent with a combination of stay-at-home orders and event cancellations, with a 14\u00a0percent decrease in March\u00a02020 compared to the preceding March; traffic warrant arrests decreased by 75\u00a0percent between the two months. However, &lt;a href=\"domestic%20violence\"&gt;domestic violence&lt;/a&gt; arrests increased in the same period.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellations of local Austin events. Numerous food-related events were canceled or postponed amid the pandemic, including Rodeo Austin and the &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Food%20%26amp%3B%20Wine%20Festival\"&gt;Austin Food &amp; Wine Festival&lt;/a&gt;. The 34th edition of South by Southwest (SXSW) was canceled by the City of Austin on March\u00a06, 2020. Its cancellation was described by \"&lt;a href=\"the%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" as \"the largest collateral damage of the virus so far on the international cultural calendar\", and a significant economic blow to the City of Austin and local businesses was anticipated in its aftermath. Some small businesses reported a 20-50\u00a0percent loss of revenue as a result of the event's cancellation. In 2019, SXSW's local economic impact was estimated at $355.9\u00a0million, with an additional contribution of $1.7\u00a0million in hotel occupancy tax revenue and $5\u00a0million in sales taxes. The festival's managing company, SXSW LLC, laid off roughly a third of its annual employees in the aftermath of the cancellation with its funding and the possibility of a 2021\u00a0edition of SXSW in jeopardy. The \"Stand With Austin\" charity fund was started by Mayor Steve Adler, County Judge Sarah Eckhardt, and State Senator &lt;a href=\"Kirk%20Watson\"&gt;Kirk Watson&lt;/a&gt; to provide patronage for businesses suffering from SXSW's cancellation. Businesses in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20River%20Cultural%20District%20%28Austin%2C%20Texas%29\"&gt;Red River Cultural District&lt;/a&gt; also began a fundraising drive, \"Banding Together\", to support impacted artists, events, and venues.\nOn July\u00a01, 2020, the planned &lt;a href=\"Austin%20City%20Limits%20Music%20Festival\"&gt;Austin City Limits Music Festival&lt;/a&gt; (ACL Music Festival) was canceled by event organizers; in 2019, the event had an estimated economic impact of $291\u00a0million and supported 1,500\u00a0jobs. Like the cancellation of SXSW in March\u00a02020, the cancellation of the ACL Music Festival was expected to be a major blow to Austin's arts, leisure, and tourism sectors. On July\u00a024, 2020, the originally planned 2020 Formula 1 &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;United States Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Circuit%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Circuit of the Americas&lt;/a&gt; was canceled. The 30th anniversary edition of the &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Marathon\"&gt;Austin Marathon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the 25th largest marathon by attendance in the U.S. and scheduled for February\u00a014, 2021\u2014was postponed to April\u00a02020. The 3M Half Marathon was canceled outright.\nResponse to policy.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Austin-American%20Statesman\"&gt;Austin-American Statesman&lt;/a&gt; poll of 213\u00a0Central Texas civic leaders in April\u00a02020 found that 71\u00a0percent of respondents rated Mayor Adler's coronavirus response as either \"good\" or \"very good\", with 22\u00a0percent assessing it as \"fair\" and 7\u00a0percent assessing it as \"poor\".\nA rally attended by at least 200\u00a0people was held on October\u00a010, 2020, at the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Governor%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;Texas Governor's Mansion&lt;/a&gt; to protest Governor Abbott's COVID-19 restrictions. Chairman of the Republican Party of Texas &lt;a href=\"Allen%20West%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Allen West&lt;/a&gt; and Texas Agriculture Commissioner &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Miller%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Sid Miller&lt;/a&gt; gave speeches at the event."
