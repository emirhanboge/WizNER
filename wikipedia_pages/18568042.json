    "text": "The Westside Shopping and Leisure Centre, on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Bern\"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, is a multi-use facility with shops, restaurants, a swimming pool, conference spaces, residences, a hotel, fitness centres, and a cinema. It was designed by international &lt;a href=\"architect\"&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Libeskind\"&gt;Daniel Libeskind&lt;/a&gt; and completed in October 2008.\nDesign.\nDespite its location west of the city, in Br\u00fcnnen-Bern, Westside is urban in scale. According to Studio Daniel Libeskind's website, the site brings \u201ctogether the dimensions of commerce, culture and leisure.\" Positioned over a motorway, the centre overlooks an &lt;a href=\"S-Bahn\"&gt;S-Bahn&lt;/a&gt; station and acts as a gateway to Bern. The complex is &lt;a href=\"crystalline\"&gt;crystalline&lt;/a&gt; in structure; a &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; skeleton supports the centre's &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fa%C3%A7ade\"&gt;fa\u00e7ade&lt;/a&gt;.\nCuts in the roof bring the changing daylight into the center's two plazas. One plaza faces the surrounding Br\u00fcnnen landscape and connects to the centre's bath, while the other plaza adjoins the hotel and cinema.\nWindows tumble across the fa\u00e7ade, bringing light into the building. This design evokes the erratic matrix of windows across Libeskind's first major international success, the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Museum%20Berlin\"&gt;Jewish Museum Berlin&lt;/a&gt;.\nReaction.\nCritics, such as David Rogers of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Jerde\"&gt;Jerde Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, have faulted Bern for neglecting to integrate such a shopping centre into the city's urban fabric. A shopping centre on the city's periphery contributes to the disintegration of the city centre and leads to a \u201closs of values,\u201d he says.\nDefenders of Westside, such as Swiss architect Barbara Holzer, argue that Bern's urban centre is not under threat and that the shopping centre instead offers \u201cnew urban spaces.\u201d Westside, with its blend of commercial, residential and recreational spaces, exemplifies populist architecture and emphasises public life. Peter Keller, of the &lt;a href=\"Z%C3%BCrich\"&gt;Z\u00fcrich&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, &lt;a href=\"Neue%20Z%C3%BCrcher%20Zeitung\"&gt;Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;, adds that the shopping centre suits its surrounding landscape and bears the striking signature of its architect."
