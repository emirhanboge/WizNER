    "text": "Fellows Park was a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"stadium\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Walsall\"&gt;Walsall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. It was the home ground of &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20F.C.\"&gt;Walsall F.C.&lt;/a&gt; from 1896 until 1990, when the team moved to the &lt;a href=\"Bescot%20Stadium\"&gt;Bescot Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nFellows Park was situated about a quarter of a mile away from the club's present ground, The Bescot Stadium, at the junction of Hilary Street and Wallows Lane.\nThe club moved to the ground from &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Road\"&gt;West Bromwich Road&lt;/a&gt; in 1896. Until 1930 it was named Hilary Street, at which point it was renamed after H.L. Fellows, a club director. Walsall's record home attendance was at Fellows Park, when 25,453 spectators were present for the team's Second Division match against &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt; on 29 August 1961.\nBy March 1988, the club was planning to build a new stadium at nearby Bescot Crescent. Within two years, construction work was underway at the new stadium site and the last league game at Fellows Park was played on 1 May 1990, when Walsall, in the process of their second successive relegation which took them into the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division\"&gt;Football League Fourth Division&lt;/a&gt;, drew 1\u20131 at home to &lt;a href=\"Rotherham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Rotherham United&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Dornan\"&gt;Andy Dornan&lt;/a&gt; scoring the last league goal at the ground \u2013 his only goal in his time at Walsall.\nThe final game played at the ground was on 11 May 1990, when retiring defender &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Hart%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Peter Hart's&lt;/a&gt; testimonial was held there with local rivals &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt; providing the opposition. This game also ended in a 1\u20131 draw, with &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Shaw%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201961%29\"&gt;Gary Shaw&lt;/a&gt; scoring an equaliser for Walsall in the 37th minute, thus going down in history as the last player to score at the stadium, in its 94-year history. The new &lt;a href=\"Bescot%20Stadium\"&gt;Bescot Stadium&lt;/a&gt; was ready for the &lt;a href=\"1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1990\u201391 season&lt;/a&gt;. A reminder of Fellows Park remains in the new stadium, in the name of the H.L. Fellows Stand. The old stadium was demolished in early 1991 and a &lt;a href=\"Morrisons\"&gt;Morrisons&lt;/a&gt; supermarket built on the site.\nIn December 1990, several weeks before the stadium's demolition, heavy snow caused the roof of the \"cowshed\" section of the stadium to collapse."
