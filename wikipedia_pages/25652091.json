    "text": "Julian Burroughs Hatton III is an American &lt;a href=\"landscape\"&gt;landscape&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"abstract%20art\"&gt;abstract art&lt;/a&gt;ist from &lt;a href=\"New%20York%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; whose paintings have appeared in galleries in the United States and France. The \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" described his painting style as \"vibrant, playful, semi-abstract landscapes\" while \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Sun\"&gt;New York Sun&lt;/a&gt;\" art critic John Goodrich compared him to French painter &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Bonnard\"&gt;Bonnard&lt;/a&gt;. Hatton's abstract landscapes have been compared to paintings by &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Dove\"&gt;Arthur Dove&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20O%27Keeffe\"&gt;Georgia O'Keeffe&lt;/a&gt; because of his \"unbridled love of pure, hot color\" similar to Gauguin and the &lt;a href=\"Fauvism\"&gt;Fauves&lt;/a&gt;, according to critic Ann Landi of \"&lt;a href=\"ARTnews\"&gt;ARTnews&lt;/a&gt;\". Hatton's vision is of \"a nature that you can literally eat with your eyes, eye candy transposed onto the entire world,\" according to critic Joel Silverstein. Hatton lives and works in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly years.\nHatton was born in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Haven%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Grand Haven, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. The cold &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; climate with two months of good weather each year, contrasted with the cold flat landscape influenced his sense of color, he recalled later. He graduated from &lt;a href=\"Phillips%20Academy\"&gt;Phillips Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Andover%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Andover, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; in 1974 in the school's first co\u2013educational class. Hatton graduated from &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; in 1979 with a major in &lt;a href=\"art%20history\"&gt;art history&lt;/a&gt;. Painting in the north of France helped him develop his understanding of color and landscape. His first application to the Studio School in New York was rejected since he lacked a portfolio. He studied with painter &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Z%C3%B3bel%20de%20Ayala%20y%20Montojo\"&gt;Fernando Zobel&lt;/a&gt; in Spain, returned with a portfolio, and was accepted. He enrolled at the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Studio%20School%20of%20Drawing%2C%20Painting%20and%20Sculpture\"&gt;New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; from 1980 to 1982. After school, Hatton lived the life of a struggling artist, working at the Water Club restaurant in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; for eight years.\nLater he worked with decorative painters, painting interiors of apartments and restaurants, while living in &lt;a href=\"SoHo\"&gt;SoHo&lt;/a&gt;. In between jobs, Hatton took his portable easel and paint supplies and bicycled to Breezy Point and &lt;a href=\"Prospect%20Park%20%28Brooklyn%29\"&gt;Prospect Park&lt;/a&gt;. Often he would work new painting over old, using parts of the old painting to help solve formal and symbolic problems, while responding to the landscape at hand.\nThrough trial and error he discovered an innate affinity for bold saturated color as well as a love of &lt;a href=\"Abstract%20art\"&gt;abstraction&lt;/a&gt; that shadowed &lt;a href=\"Naturalism%20%28arts%29\"&gt;naturalism&lt;/a&gt;. His work has been called \"lyrical.\" During these years he often worked with fellow artist and wife Alison Berry. His work began to receive recognition, and his paintings started to be shown in art galleries.\nCareer.\nHatton exhibited at &lt;a href=\"New%20York%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; galleries including Elizabeth Harris Gallery, Kathryn Markel Gallery, Frederieke Taylor Gallery, Frank Mario Gallery, Jon Leon Gallery, Eighth Floor Gallery, Lohin Geduld Gallery and the American Academy of Arts and Letters Invitational Exhibit. He has exhibited his artwork in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2C%20California\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dallas%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Charlotte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"La%20Jolla%2C%20California\"&gt;La Jolla&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20Harbor%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Southwest Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belfast%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maine\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;. His work was shown internationally at the Museum at &lt;a href=\"Rochefort-en-Terre\"&gt;Rochefort-en-Terre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brittany%20%28administrative%20region%29\"&gt;Brittany, France&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Artinfo\"&gt;ArtInfo&lt;/a&gt;\" described his paintings as \"boldly integrating invented and observed shapes and colors\" with his \"own lexicon of shapes and lines which he arranges in innovative ways\" using a \"homemade visual syntax\" yielding a \"feast of contradictions.\" During these years he taught at the &lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island%20School%20of%20Design\"&gt;Rhode Island School of Design&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Swarthmore%20College\"&gt;Swarthmore College&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vermont%20Studio%20Center\"&gt;Vermont Studio Center&lt;/a&gt;. His paintings have appeared in the Hijirizaka Collection in &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%2C%20Japan\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, the IBJ Schroder Bank &amp; Trust in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, and at Brook Partners in &lt;a href=\"Dallas%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;. His paintings are in numerous collections, from the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Wynn\"&gt;Steve Wynn&lt;/a&gt; collection in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Valley\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;.\nReactions by critics.\n\"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" critics have described his painting style as a \"layered shapes in saturated colors\" which were \"vibrant, playful, semi-abstract landscapes\" which \"layers broad, richly colored shapes of trees, rivers and hills into funky, tautly frontal arcadian visions.\" Paintings had a \"mix of &lt;a href=\"Fauvism\"&gt;Fauvism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abstract%20Expressionism\"&gt;Abstract Expressionism&lt;/a&gt; and outsider vision.\nArt critic John Goodrich of the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Sun\"&gt;New York Sun&lt;/a&gt;\" felt Hatton's paintings were less \"real\" in terms of factual description but they \"contain their own peculiar truths, evident in keenly felt colors and designs.\" Goodrich felt Hatton \"finds expression through his forms.\" Hatton's paintings \"remind us of the potency of a particular modernist aesthetic, and they reward prolonged looking.\" Goodrich elaborated:\nCritic Ann Landi of \"&lt;a href=\"ARTnews\"&gt;ARTnews&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote there was \"something endearingly anachronistic about Julian Hatton's abstractions\" which had an \"unbridled love of pure, hot color,\" and compared Hatton to &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Dove\"&gt;Arthur Dove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20O%27Keeffe\"&gt;Georgia O'Keeffe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Gauguin\"&gt;Paul Gauguin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fauvism\"&gt;the Fauvres&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritic David Ebony in \"ArtNet\" in 1996 described Hatton's paintings:\nEbony wrote in 2005 in \"&lt;a href=\"Art%20in%20America\"&gt;Art in America&lt;/a&gt;\" that Hatton \"experiments with complex and sometimes contradictory spatial relationships\" and that his landscapes \"consist of Cubist-inspired fractured planes and shifting, multiple perspectives.\" Critic Joel Silverstein in \"Reviewny.com\" suggested Hatton's paintings \"sing to each other in a high key citron-like color\" and compared him to &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Gauguin\"&gt;Paul Gauguin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Mir%C3%B3\"&gt;Mir\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20von%20Hofmann\"&gt;Hofmann&lt;/a&gt;. He described Hatton as a \"lyrical designer\" who \"abstracts form by promoting visual attractiveness.\"\nArtist Barbara Rothenberg, who teaches art at the Silver Mine Guild Arts Center in &lt;a href=\"New%20Canaan%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;New Canaan, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, and who follows Hatton's career, suggested that Hatton's works were becoming more \"abandoned\" and that the artist was taking greater \"risks\"; she likes Hatton's use of the color red.\nCritic Hovey Brock writing in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Brooklyn%20Rail\"&gt;The Brooklyn Rail&lt;/a&gt;\" described Hatton's paintings as having a \"healthy self-confidence not only in his artistic process, but also in the very enterprise of abstract painting.\" Critic Peter Malone of \"&lt;a href=\"Hyperallergic\"&gt;Hyperallergic&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine described Hatton's 2019 show entitled \"Bewilderness\" as \"vigorously overlapping perspectives are pulled into a unified whole made of delightfully unstable parts\" that demonstrate a \"copious gift for invention, expressed through witty references to flowers, trees, rivers, pathways, and other landscape elements.\""
