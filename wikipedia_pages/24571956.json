Before the takeover by &lt;a href=\"FK%20Makedonija%20Gjor%C4%8De%20Petrov\"&gt;Makedonija Gjor\u010de Petrov&lt;/a&gt;' head office, their home games were played at the \u0160i\u0161evo football field. At the season 2011-12, the club started as FK Treska and at the mid season changed the name into Makedonija Gjor\u010de Petrov 1932."
