He moved to &lt;a href=\"Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.\"&gt;Leyton Orient&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, playing 74 times in all competitions in two seasons. He then moved to &lt;a href=\"Northampton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Northampton Town&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a key player in the club's successful promotion season of &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2005\u201306&lt;/a&gt;, with his long throw-in being a prominent weapon in the team's tactical arsenal that year.\nHunt signed for &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Shrewsbury Town&lt;/a&gt; on 15 May 2007, on a two-year deal after rejecting an offer of a contract extension at Northampton. In January 2009, he came to an agreement with &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Simpson%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Paul Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, the Shrewsbury Town boss, on the remainder of his contract and consequently left the club as he attempted to move back down south as his family failed to settle in the area. His spell at the club was littered by injuries, resulting in few appearances over the one-and-a-half seasons he was at the club.\nHunt signed for &lt;a href=\"Brentford%20F.C.\"&gt;Brentford&lt;/a&gt; on 9 January 2009, on a contract until the end of the season.

He signed a new two-year contract in June 2009.\nHe signed for &lt;a href=\"Crawley%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Crawley Town&lt;/a&gt; on 31 December 2010, initially on a one-month loan, with a view to a permanent move being completed at the end of January 2011. He made his debut for the club the next day as a 63rd-minute substitute against Eastbourne Borough. Hunt assisted Crawley to the Conference title in &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2010\u201311&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the season, after a successful loan, Hunt signed for Crawley permanently on a two-year deal.\nIn June 2013, after leaving Crawley by mutual consent, he signed for &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Oxford United&lt;/a&gt;. On 31 October 2014 he was loaned to &lt;a href=\"Barnet%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnet&lt;/a&gt; until January 2015.\nOn 2 February 2015, Hunt left Oxford United by mutual consent.\nAfter turning down an opportunity from &lt;a href=\"Dean%20Saunders\"&gt;Dean Saunders&lt;/a&gt; to return to the professional game with Crawley Town, Hunt co-founded the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20160109190301/http%3A//beanteam.info/\"&gt;Bean Team&lt;/a&gt;: a new distribution network for a premium healthy brand of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.organogold.com/\"&gt;Organo&lt;/a&gt; coffee. He also briefly signed for National League South side &lt;a href=\"Maidenhead%20United%20FC\"&gt;Maidenhead United&lt;/a&gt;, before joining &lt;a href=\"Margate%20FC\"&gt;Margate&lt;/a&gt; in June 2015.\nOn 1 June 2016, Hunt signed for National League South rivals &lt;a href=\"Wealdstone%20F.C.\"&gt;Wealdstone&lt;/a&gt;. After one season at &lt;a href=\"Wealdstone%20F.C.\"&gt;Grosvenor Vale&lt;/a&gt;, the midfielder penned another one-season deal with The Stones in June 2017."
