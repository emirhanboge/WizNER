She is exhausted after a long day of seeing patients and dealing with her petulant intern, Julien (Bonnaud). When the buzzer rings after hours, Jenny instructs Julien to ignore it. The next day, Jenny is devastated to hear that the person who rang the buzzer the previous night, a young African woman, was found dead by the river, her skull fractured.

Guilt-ridden, Jenny is determined to find out who the unknown girl was.\nProduction.\nIn April 2015, &lt;a href=\"Ad%C3%A8le%20Haenel\"&gt;Ad\u00e8le Haenel&lt;/a&gt; joined the cast of the film, with the &lt;a href=\"Dardenne%20brothers\"&gt;Dardenne brothers&lt;/a&gt;, Luc and Jean-Pierre, directing from a screenplay they wrote. \"The Unknown Girl\" is produced through the directors' Belgian company Les Films du Fleuve in collaboration with the French company Archipel 35.

Mixed critical response to the film led to the Dardenne brothers making extensive cuts after Cannes, shortening the film by seven minutes than the original cut premiered at the festival. Luc Dardenne stated that \"There are several critics who are also friends who liked it a lot but thought there were certain places in the film that didn\u2019t work very well. I believe it was that which prompted our concern. We were ready to make changes.\" The new cut was officially shown in June at the &lt;a href=\"Institut%20Lumi%C3%A8re\"&gt;Institut Lumi\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.
