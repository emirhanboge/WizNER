    "text": "The term Grand Slam (\"GS\") in &lt;a href=\"figure%20skating\"&gt;figure skating&lt;/a&gt; is a title sometimes used by figure skating analysts for the achievement of winning all three major annual senior-level international competitions (&lt;a href=\"World%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships\"&gt;World Championships&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20of%20Figure%20Skating%20Final\"&gt;Grand Prix Final&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"European%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships\"&gt;European Championships&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Four%20Continents%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships\"&gt;Four Continents Championships&lt;/a&gt;) within a single season within one of the four disciplines: &lt;a href=\"single%20skating\"&gt;men's singles, ladies' singles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pair%20skating\"&gt;pairs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ice%20dancing\"&gt;ice dance&lt;/a&gt;. Winning all three major annual senior-level international competitions at any point during the course of a career is called a \"Career Grand Slam\". In pair skating and ice dancing, one team may accomplish a Career Grand Slam skating together or one skater may achieve it with different partners.\nWinning the gold medal at the &lt;a href=\"Figure%20skating%20at%20the%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the three major annual senior-level international competitions in a single season is called a \"Golden Grand Slam\" or \"Golden Slam\". A skater who wins all three major annual senior-level international competitions and the Olympic gold medal during his or her career is said to have achieved a \"Career Golden Grand Slam\" or \"Career Golden Slam\".\nWinning both major junior-level international competitions (&lt;a href=\"World%20Junior%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships\"&gt;World Junior Championships&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ISU%20Junior%20Grand%20Prix%20Final\"&gt;Junior Grand Prix Final&lt;/a&gt;) and all four major senior-level international competitions at any point during the course of a career is called a \"Career Super Grand Slam\" or \"Super Slam\".\nHistory.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"World%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships\"&gt;World Figure Skating Championships&lt;/a&gt; (\"WC\") was held in 1896. The &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20of%20Figure%20Skating%20Final\"&gt;Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final&lt;/a&gt; (\"GPF\", formerly Champions Series Final) was inaugurated in 1995. The &lt;a href=\"European%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships\"&gt;European Figure Skating Championships&lt;/a&gt; (\"EC\"), open to skaters from European countries, first took place in 1891. The &lt;a href=\"International%20Skating%20Union\"&gt;International Skating Union&lt;/a&gt; (ISU) established the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Continents%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships\"&gt;Four Continents Figure Skating Championships&lt;/a&gt; (\"4CC\") in 1999 to provide skaters representing non-European countries. So the possibility of being the reigning champion of all three major annual senior-level international competitions (WC, GPF, and EC or 4CC) did not exist until the 1995\u201396 season.\nFigure skating was first contested in the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; (\"OG\") in 1908. The first &lt;a href=\"World%20Junior%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships\"&gt;World Junior Figure Skating Championships&lt;/a&gt; (\"JWC\") were held in 1976. The &lt;a href=\"ISU%20Junior%20Grand%20Prix%20Final\"&gt;Junior Grand Prix Final&lt;/a&gt; (\"JGPF\", formerly ISU Junior Series Final) was established in the 1997\u201398 season. So the possibility of being the super reigning champion of both major junior-level international competitions (JWC and JGPF) and all four major senior-level international competitions (OG, WC, GPF, and EC or 4CC) did not exist until the 1997\u201398 season.\nOn June 29, 2011, a report by &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; used the term \"Grand Slam\" to figure skating to describe the achievement of winning the Grand Prix of Final, the Four Continents Championships, and the World Championships. On April 1, 2012, in a news report on the ladies' event of the 2012 World Figure Skating Championships by &lt;a href=\"Sina%20Sports\"&gt;Sina Sports&lt;/a&gt; in the Chinese language, the term \"Grand Slam\" (\"\u5927\u6ee1\u8d2f\") was used to describe the winning of the Grand Prix of Final, the European Championships and the World Championships. On December 11, 2016, a news report by Sina Sports on the ice dance event of the 2016\u201317 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final in the Chinese language used the term \"Super Slam\" (\"\u8d85\u7ea7\u5927\u6ee1\u8d2f\") to describe the achievement of winning the World Junior Championships, the Junior Grand Prix Final, the Four Continents Championships, the World Championships, the Grand Prix of Final, and the Olympic Games.\nOn 9 February 2020, a report by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Skating%20Union\"&gt;International Skating Union&lt;/a&gt; (ISU) used the term \"Golden Slam\" to describe the achievement of winning all four major senior-level international competitions (Winter Olympics, World Championships, Grand Prix of Final, and Four Continents Championships). On the same day, a report by the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Channel\"&gt;Olympic Channel&lt;/a&gt;, which is operated by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; (IOC), used the term \"Super Slam\" to figure skating to describe the achievement of winning both major junior-level international competitions (JWC and JGPF) and all four major senior-level international competitions (OG, WC, GPF, and 4CC).\nGrand Slam.\nThe remainder of this section is a complete list, by discipline, of all skaters who have completed the Grand Slam ordered chronologically, the numbers of Grand Slams by nation, and the first (or youngest/oldest) skater who achieved the Grand Slam.\nMen's singles.\nChronological\nFour men's single skaters have completed the Grand Slam.
