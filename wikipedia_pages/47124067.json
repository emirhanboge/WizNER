    "text": "Mallory Elton Walker (May 22, 1935, &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 December 7, 2014, &lt;a href=\"Anaheim%2C%20California\"&gt;Anaheim, California&lt;/a&gt;) was an American &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic &lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt; and music educator who had an active international singing career in operas and concerts from the late 1950s until his death in 2014. His career was at its height during the 1960s and 1970s when he was busy with many important opera companies in the United States and had engagements in European opera houses. His career hit a slump in the early 1980s due to vocal difficulties, and afterwards his major engagements became less frequent. He taught on the voice faculty at the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Conservatory%20of%20Music\"&gt;Boston Conservatory of Music&lt;/a&gt; and out of a private voice studio in Los Angeles.\nLife and career.\nBorn in New Orleans, Walker earned a Bachelor of Music degree from &lt;a href=\"Occidental%20College\"&gt;Occidental College&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles which he attended on a full vocal scholarship. He began his singing career as a member of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Chorus\"&gt;United States Army Chorus&lt;/a&gt; in 1957. He made his professional opera debut portraying Tom Rakewell in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Rake%E2%80%99s%20Progress\"&gt;The Rake\u2019s Progress&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20National%20Opera\"&gt;Washington National Opera&lt;/a&gt; in 1959. He then became a soloist with the &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Shaw%20Chorale\"&gt;Robert Shaw Chorale&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he toured the United States performing the tenor solos in &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach\"&gt;Johann Sebastian Bach&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Mass%20in%20B%20minor\"&gt;Mass in B minor&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1960. He recorded the work under &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Shaw%20%28conductor%29\"&gt;Robert Shaw&lt;/a&gt;'s baton for the &lt;a href=\"RCA%20Victor\"&gt;RCA Victor&lt;/a&gt; label.\nIn 1960 Walker entered the Metropolitan Opera Studio, the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt;'s school for young opera singers, where he was a pupil of &lt;a href=\"George%20Schick\"&gt;George Schick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cornelius%20Reid\"&gt;Cornelius Reid&lt;/a&gt;. That same year he sang Ferrando in Mozarts's \"&lt;a href=\"Cos%C3%AC%20Fan%20Tutte\"&gt;Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte&lt;/a&gt;\" at &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20Center\"&gt;Lincoln Center&lt;/a&gt; for a performance attended by New York City public school children under the auspices of the Student Program of Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan Opera Guild. In 1962 he made his debut at the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Opera\"&gt;San Francisco Opera&lt;/a&gt; (SFO) as Belmonte in \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Entf%C3%BChrung%20aus%20dem%20Serail\"&gt;Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail&lt;/a&gt;\", and returned there the following year as Tamino in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Magic%20Flute\"&gt;The Magic Flute&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1963-1964 Walker was a resident artist at the &lt;a href=\"Oldenburgisches%20Staatstheater\"&gt;Oldenburgisches Staatstheater&lt;/a&gt;. He then became a resident artist at the &lt;a href=\"Cologne%20Opera\"&gt;Cologne Opera&lt;/a&gt; from 1964-1966. Other contracts soon followed with such companies as the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Opera\"&gt;Cincinnati Opera&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Grand%20Opera\"&gt;Houston Grand Opera&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lyric%20Opera%20of%20Kansas%20City\"&gt;Lyric Opera of Kansas City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Opera\"&gt;Miami Opera&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%20Opera\"&gt;New Orleans Opera&lt;/a&gt; among others. In 1971 he created the role of Jonathan Gilourin in the world premiere of &lt;a href=\"Dominick%20Argento\"&gt;Dominick Argento&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s \"Colonel Jonathan the Saint\" at the &lt;a href=\"Denver%20Lyric%20Opera\"&gt;Denver Lyric Opera&lt;/a&gt;. In 1974 he was handpicked by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Georg%20Solti\"&gt;Sir Georg Solti&lt;/a&gt; to sing the role of the Evangelist in Bach's \"&lt;a href=\"St%20Matthew%20Passion\"&gt;St Matthew Passion&lt;/a&gt;\" with the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Symphony%20Orchestra\"&gt;Chicago Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; (CSO). He returned twice more for performances with Solti and the CSO for performances of the Shepherd in Stravinsky's \"&lt;a href=\"Oedipus%20rex%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Oedipus Rex&lt;/a&gt;\" (1976) and Beethoven's \"&lt;a href=\"Missa%20Solemnis\"&gt;Missa Solemnis&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977); the latter of which was recorded for &lt;a href=\"London%20Records\"&gt;London Records&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1978 Walker made his debut at the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt; in 1978, as Captain Vere in \"&lt;a href=\"Billy%20Budd%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Billy Budd&lt;/a&gt;\". He returned to the SFO in 1979 for performances in \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20in%20Venice\"&gt;Death in Venice&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Fanciulla%20del%20West\"&gt;La Fanciulla del West&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Gianni%20Schicchi\"&gt;Gianni Schicchi&lt;/a&gt;\". In the early 1980s his career hit a slump as he began to experience vocal difficulties. He took work anywhere he could get, including singing in opera choruses and as a church soloist. He attracted attention again at the &lt;a href=\"Mostly%20Mozart%20Festival\"&gt;Mostly Mozart Festival&lt;/a&gt; in 1984 when he replaced an ailing &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Hadley\"&gt;Jerry Hadley&lt;/a&gt; in the title role of Mozart's \"&lt;a href=\"Idomeneo\"&gt;Idomeneo&lt;/a&gt;\". Walker had been a member of the opera chorus and stepped in with less than a day's notice to very positive reviews in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1985 he portrayed Kabuki in the world premiere of &lt;a href=\"Minoru%20Miki\"&gt;Minoru Miki&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s \"&lt;a href=\"J%C5%8Druri%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Joruri&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Theatre%20of%20Saint%20Louis\"&gt;Opera Theatre of Saint Louis&lt;/a&gt;. After this his performances with major companies were infrequent, although he remained active as a concert soloist, chorus singer and church singer until his death in 2014 at the age of 79.\nSome of the other roles Walker performed on stage during his career included Alfredo in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Traviata\"&gt;La Traviata&lt;/a&gt;\", Alwa in \"&lt;a href=\"Lulu%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Lulu&lt;/a&gt;\", Don Ottavio in \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Giovanni\"&gt;Don Giovanni&lt;/a&gt;\", Fenton in Verdi's \"&lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Falstaff&lt;/a&gt;\", Ferrando in \"&lt;a href=\"Cos%C3%AC%20fan%20tutte\"&gt;Cos\u00ec fan tutte&lt;/a&gt;\", Nadir in \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20p%C3%AAcheurs%20de%20perles\"&gt;Les p\u00eacheurs de perles&lt;/a&gt;\", Rodolfo in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Boh%C3%A8me\"&gt;La Boh\u00e8me&lt;/a&gt;\", and the title role in \"&lt;a href=\"Albert%20Herring\"&gt;Albert Herring&lt;/a&gt;\"."
