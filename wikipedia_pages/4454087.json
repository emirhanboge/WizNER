    "text": "Erwin Louis Hahn (June 9, 1921 \u2013 September 20, 2016) was an American &lt;a href=\"physicist\"&gt;physicist&lt;/a&gt;, best known for his work on &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance\"&gt;nuclear magnetic resonance&lt;/a&gt; (NMR). In 1950 he discovered the &lt;a href=\"spin%20echo\"&gt;spin echo&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\nHe grew up in &lt;a href=\"Sewickley%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Sewickley, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. He received his &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Science\"&gt;B.S.&lt;/a&gt; in Physics from &lt;a href=\"Juniata%20College\"&gt;Juniata College&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Science\"&gt;M.S.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Philosophy\"&gt;Doctor of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign\"&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign&lt;/a&gt;. He served as an enlisted sailor in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; and was an instructor on radar and sonar.\nCareer and research.\nHe was professor of physics, from 1955 to 1991, and subsequently, &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Emeritus\"&gt;Professor Emeritus&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley\"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;. Hahn was elected a Fellow of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in 1971. In 1993 he was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Comstock%20Prize%20in%20Physics\"&gt;Comstock Prize in Physics&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, Sir &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Mansfield\"&gt;Peter Mansfield&lt;/a&gt; said in his autobiography that Hahn was \"the person who really missed out\" the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; for his contribution to the principles of spin echoes. He also received the 2016 Gold Medal from the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM). The award, ISMRM's highest honor, was given to Hahn for his creation of pulsed magnetic resonance and processes of signal refocusing which are essential to modern day MRI. He died at the age of 95 in 2016."
