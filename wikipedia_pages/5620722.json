    "text": "Return of the Phantom is a &lt;a href=\"Point-and-click%20adventure%20game\"&gt;point-and-click&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"graphic%20adventure%20game\"&gt;graphic adventure game&lt;/a&gt; developed and published by &lt;a href=\"MicroProse\"&gt;MicroProse&lt;/a&gt; in 1993. It was produced by &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Gruson\"&gt;Matt Gruson&lt;/a&gt; and designed/written by future James Bond novelist &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20Benson\"&gt;Raymond Benson&lt;/a&gt;. It is based on the 1910 novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Phantom%20of%20the%20Opera\"&gt;The Phantom of the Opera&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Gaston%20Leroux\"&gt;Gaston Leroux&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe game was the second graphical adventure game developed by MicroProse, following \"&lt;a href=\"Rex%20Nebular%20and%20the%20Cosmic%20Gender%20Bender\"&gt;Rex Nebular&lt;/a&gt;\" and preceding \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonsphere\"&gt;Dragonsphere&lt;/a&gt;\". It was developed using the \"MicroProse Adventure Development\" system, and made use of &lt;a href=\"8-bit%20color\"&gt;256-colour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Computer%20graphics\"&gt;graphics&lt;/a&gt;. A CD version featuring full voices for the characters was also released.\nPlot.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Palais%20Garnier\"&gt;Palais Garnier&lt;/a&gt; is in the midst of the world premiere of \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Juan%20Triumphant\"&gt;Don Juan Triumphant&lt;/a&gt;\" when the enormous &lt;a href=\"chandelier\"&gt;chandelier&lt;/a&gt; adorning the domed ceiling of the auditorium plunges into the middle of the stalls and kills several members of the audience. The player takes the role of Raoul Montand, a detective from the &lt;a href=\"S%C3%BBret%C3%A9\"&gt;S\u00fbret\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and patron of the &lt;a href=\"Opera\"&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt;. The manager, Monsieur Brie, suspects the Phantom may be the cause and has Raoul investigate. Raoul encounters the leading actress of the show, Christine Florent, who has received a note from the Phantom which threatens her. Some time later, Christine is found strangled by the Phantom. Raoul goes to the catwalk where the Phantom appears and pushes him off the edge. Then, he awakens to find himself transported back in time to the year 1881 where he is mistaken for the &lt;a href=\"Viscount%20Raoul%20de%20Chagny\"&gt;Viscount Raoul de Chagny&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring a production, &lt;a href=\"Erik%20%28The%20Phantom%20of%20the%20Opera%29\"&gt;Erik&lt;/a&gt; captures &lt;a href=\"Christine%20Daa%C3%A9\"&gt;Christine Daa\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. After a great deal of work and exploring, Raoul enters the Phantom's lair and rescues Christine, but the Phantom appears once more and re-captures Christine. Raoul climbs to the chandelier and does battle with the Phantom, eventually causing the chandelier to fall and kill both men. Raoul awakens back in his own time, where none of the events related to the Phantom seem to have taken place, but before the &lt;a href=\"Closing%20credits\"&gt;credits&lt;/a&gt; begin the Phantom's shadow is seen behind him.\nReception.\n\"QuestBusters\" called \"Return of the Phantom\" \"a high quality game with few bugs\" and praised the game for having used professional actors, a designer with real-world experience in Broadway theatre, and an original \"Bach inspired\" score. The magazine wrote that \"Micro Prose uses their own unique adaptation of the classical animation overlaying process, producing a very life-like final animation video. Numerous digitized sound effects round off the experience.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Computer%20Gaming%20World\"&gt;Computer Gaming World&lt;/a&gt;\" in October 1993 called the game's plot \"gripping\" and \"intriguing\". While criticizing the slow movement speed and lack of keyboard shortcuts, and the game \"offering only 12 to 18 hours of gaming for the average player\" given the price, it praised the rotoscoped animation\u2014\"as fluid and lifelike as that of any computer product to date\"\u2014and \"rich and full\" music. The magazine concluded that \"Phantom\" was best suited for those who preferred story over puzzles, especially at a lower price. It criticized the CD-ROM version as \"a disappointment\" for \"unspiring vocals and slow [CD] access\". In April 1994 the magazine said that the CD version \"needed more rehearsals prior to release\". While preferable to the floppy version \"the vocal talent leaves much to be desired\", and with no added lip movement animation the game resembled \"a poorly subtitled foreign film\"."
