    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach\"&gt;Johann Sebastian Bach&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"St%20Matthew%20Passion\"&gt;St Matthew Passion&lt;/a&gt;\" (), , is structured on multiple levels: the composition is structured in three levels of text sources (Gospel, libretto and chorales) and by the different forms that are used for musical expression (arias, recitatives and choruses).\nBach's large choral composition was written to present the &lt;a href=\"Passion%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;Passion&lt;/a&gt;, as told in the &lt;a href=\"Gospel%20of%20Matthew\"&gt;Gospel of Matthew&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href=\"Vespers%20in%20Lutheranism\"&gt;vespers service&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Good%20Friday\"&gt;Good Friday&lt;/a&gt;. It is composed in two parts, that were to be performed before and after the sermon of that service. Part I covers the events until the arrest of Jesus and Part II concludes with his burial and the sealing of his grave.\nBach took the Gospel text for the composition from &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther\"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Luther%20Bible\"&gt;German translation&lt;/a&gt; of and . Contemporary poetry in &lt;a href=\"Picander\"&gt;Picander&lt;/a&gt;'s libretto and chorales comment on the Bible text and open and close most scenes of the narration.\nNumbering of the movements.\nBach did not number the sections of the \"&lt;a href=\"St%20Matthew%20Passion\"&gt;St Matthew Passion&lt;/a&gt;\" but twentieth-century scholars have done so. The &lt;a href=\"Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis\"&gt;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis&lt;/a&gt; (BWV, Bach Works Catalog) divides the work into 78 numbers (vocal &lt;a href=\"Movement%20%28music%29\"&gt;movements&lt;/a&gt;), while the &lt;a href=\"Neue%20Bach-Ausgabe\"&gt;Neue Bach-Ausgabe&lt;/a&gt; (NBA, New Bach Edition) divides the piece into 68 movements. Both use lettered subsections in some cases. Movement numbers in this article follow the NBA scheme, except for the table with the movements that cross-references both numbering systems.\nText based structure.\nThe text is taken from three sources: the biblical texts, contemporary poetry by &lt;a href=\"Picander\"&gt;Picander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chorale\"&gt;chorale&lt;/a&gt;s.\nScene division based on the Gospel text.\nThe \"St Matthew Passion\" can be divided in &lt;a href=\"Scene%20%28drama%29\"&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt;s or \"stations\" that follow the dramatic action of the Gospel account in different locations. Whatever the chosen scene division (none of them indicated by the composer in the score), scenes end on an aria, a chorus, or in the midst of a Gospel text section. In the latter case the ending of the scene would usually be on a &lt;a href=\"turba\"&gt;turba&lt;/a&gt; chorus, such as ending the scene where Jesus dies at the cross.\nNew scenes begin with Gospel text sung by the Evangelist, except the first scene of each of the two parts of the composition. In other words, except for the chorus and aria that open Part One and Part Two, chorales and arias are a meditation after the narration of the action in the sung Gospel text.\nLibretto.\n&lt;a href=\"Christian%20Friedrich%20Henrici\"&gt;Christian Friedrich Henrici&lt;/a&gt; (Picander), who collaborated with Bach, wrote text for recitatives and arias, and for the large scale choral movements that open and close the Passion. Other libretto sections came from publications by &lt;a href=\"Salomo%20Franck\"&gt;Salomo Franck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barthold%20Heinrich%20Brockes\"&gt;Barthold Heinrich Brockes&lt;/a&gt;.\nScenes can be opened and closed by arias: &lt;a href=\"%236\"&gt;No. 6&lt;/a&gt; , an aria for alto, concludes the scene at &lt;a href=\"Bethany\"&gt;Bethany&lt;/a&gt;. Part II opens with an aria, .\nChorales.\nThe oldest chorale chosen for the Passion dates from 1525. Bach used the hymns in different ways, most are four-part setting, two are the of the two chorale fantasias framing Part I, one as a commenting element in a tenor recitative.\nThree of the texts Bach used for chorale settings are written by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Gerhardt\"&gt;Paul Gerhardt&lt;/a&gt;. Bach included five stanzas of his \"\" in the Passion, and he uses the &lt;a href=\"%2354\"&gt;first two stanzas of the poem&lt;/a&gt; to conclude the Flagellation scene.\nMusical structure.\nThe work is composed for double &lt;a href=\"choir\"&gt;choir&lt;/a&gt;, double &lt;a href=\"orchestra\"&gt;orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, and vocal soloists. The choirs are abbreviated Ch I and Ch II, individual voice parts as S (&lt;a href=\"soprano\"&gt;soprano&lt;/a&gt;), A (&lt;a href=\"alto\"&gt;alto&lt;/a&gt;), T (&lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt;), and B (&lt;a href=\"Bass%20%28voice%20type%29\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt;). Both choirs are four-part, &lt;a href=\"SATB\"&gt;SATB&lt;/a&gt;. The orchestra consists of &lt;a href=\"Woodwind%20instrument\"&gt;woodwind&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"String%20instrument\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Figured%20bass%23Basso%20continuo\"&gt;basso continuo&lt;/a&gt; (Bc). Woodwinds are &lt;a href=\"recorder%20%28musical%20instrument%29\"&gt;recorders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flauto%20traverso\"&gt;flauto traverso&lt;/a&gt; (transverse flute) (Ft), &lt;a href=\"oboe\"&gt;oboe&lt;/a&gt; (Ob), &lt;a href=\"oboe%20d%27amore\"&gt;oboe d'amore&lt;/a&gt; (Oa), and &lt;a href=\"oboe%20da%20caccia\"&gt;oboe da caccia&lt;/a&gt; (Oc). Strings are &lt;a href=\"violin\"&gt;violin&lt;/a&gt; (Vn), solo violin (Vs), &lt;a href=\"viola\"&gt;viola&lt;/a&gt; (Va), &lt;a href=\"lute\"&gt;lute&lt;/a&gt; (Lt), and &lt;a href=\"viola%20da%20gamba\"&gt;viola da gamba&lt;/a&gt; (Vg). Continuo are &lt;a href=\"violoncello\"&gt;violoncello&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"double%20bass\"&gt;double bass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bassoon\"&gt;bassoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Organ%20%28instrument%29\"&gt;organ&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bible story is told by the &lt;a href=\"Evangelist%20%28Bach%29\"&gt;Evangelist&lt;/a&gt; (Ev) in secco &lt;a href=\"recitative\"&gt;recitative&lt;/a&gt;, and by the characters that have direct speech in the narrative. The &lt;a href=\"Vox%20Christi\"&gt;speech of Jesus&lt;/a&gt; sings in &lt;a href=\"accompagnato\"&gt;accompagnato&lt;/a&gt; recitative, except at the beginning of &lt;a href=\"%2361a\"&gt;No. 61a&lt;/a&gt; where Jesus utters his last words \"&lt;a href=\"Sayings%20of%20Jesus%20on%20the%20cross%234.%20My%20God.2C%20my%20God.2C%20why%20have%20you%20forsaken%20me.3F\"&gt;Eli, Eli, lama, lama asabthani&lt;/a&gt;\" in recitative secco (see facsimile image on the right). The speech of other persons, called soliloquents, is also set as secco recitative. Soliloquents are &lt;a href=\"Judas%20Iscariot\"&gt;Judas&lt;/a&gt; (B), &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Peter\"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt; (B), two witnesses (A T), two high priests (B), two maids (S), &lt;a href=\"Pontius%20Pilate\"&gt;Pilate&lt;/a&gt; (B), and &lt;a href=\"Pontius%20Pilate%27s%20wife\"&gt;his wife&lt;/a&gt; (S). The speech of groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Disciple%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;disciples&lt;/a&gt; and the crowd, are expressed in &lt;a href=\"turba\"&gt;turba&lt;/a&gt; choruses.\nReflecting thoughts on contemporary poetry appear as sequence of recitatives (rec) and &lt;a href=\"aria\"&gt;aria&lt;/a&gt;s, sometimes just the latter, and in choral movements. Most chorales are four-part settings. Several movements use a combination of forms, such as an aria with chorale, a &lt;a href=\"chorale%20fantasia\"&gt;chorale fantasia&lt;/a&gt;, a chorus with a chorale as a &lt;a href=\"cantus%20firmus\"&gt;cantus firmus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Chorale\"&gt;Chorale&lt;/a&gt;s were performed by both groups combined, with each voice type in &lt;a href=\"unison\"&gt;unison&lt;/a&gt;. Movement &lt;a href=\"%2363\"&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;b, (Truly, this man was God's own Son most truly), is treated the same way. Part I ends with a chorale fantasia that is based on the opening chorus of the \"&lt;a href=\"St%20John%20Passion\"&gt;St John Passion&lt;/a&gt;\" in its second version, also performed by both choirs in unison, whereas the opening chorus is for double choir with the chorale \"\" as the &lt;a href=\"cantus%20firmus\"&gt;cantus firmus&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally played, later sung. The closing chorus is in &lt;a href=\"da%20capo\"&gt;da capo&lt;/a&gt; form for two choirs.\nMovements.\nColumn 1 of the table is the movement number in the &lt;a href=\"Neue%20Bach-Ausgabe\"&gt;Neue Bach-Ausgabe&lt;/a&gt;; column 2 is this number in the &lt;a href=\"Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis\"&gt;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis&lt;/a&gt;. The last column shows the &lt;a href=\"incipit\"&gt;incipit&lt;/a&gt;, the first measures of each movement with text."
