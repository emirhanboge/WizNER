    "text": "Cardamine pratensis, the cuckoo flower, lady's smock, mayflower, or milkmaids, is a &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; in the family &lt;a href=\"Brassicaceae\"&gt;Brassicaceae&lt;/a&gt;. It is a perennial herb native throughout most of &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Asia\"&gt;Western Asia&lt;/a&gt;. The specific name \"pratensis\" is &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; for \"meadow\".\nDescription.\n\"Cardamine pratensis\" is a &lt;a href=\"herbaceous\"&gt;herbaceous&lt;/a&gt;, hairless, &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial plant&lt;/a&gt; growing to 40\u201360\u00a0cm tall, with pinnate &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; 5\u201312\u00a0cm long with 3\u201315 leaflets, each leaflet about 1\u00a0cm long. The &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are produced on a spike 10\u201330\u00a0cm long, each flower 1\u20132\u00a0cm in diameter with four very pale violet-pink (rarely white) petals. The style of the fruit is short or longish. It grows best close to water.\nEtymology.\nIts common name \"cuckoo flower\" derives from the formation of the plant's flowers at around the same time as the arrival each spring of the first &lt;a href=\"Common%20cuckoo\"&gt;cuckoo&lt;/a&gt;s in the British Isles. An alternative 16th century dated tale refers to 'cuckoo spit', which the plant is sometimes covered in. Which is due to a bug called the &lt;a href=\"froghopper\"&gt;froghopper&lt;/a&gt; and not the cuckoo.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Cardamine pratensis\" is a &lt;a href=\"polyploid%20complex\"&gt;polyploid complex&lt;/a&gt;, with all ploidy levels from diploid to decaploid, and dodecaploid, known, as well as frequent aneuploids. It may be treated as a single species, or divided into \"Cardamine pratensis\" s.str. (diploid to heptaploid) and \"Cardamine palustris\" (syn. \"Cardamine pratensis\" &lt;a href=\"subspecies\"&gt;subsp.&lt;/a&gt; \"paludosa\" , \"Cardamine dentata\" )) (octaploid to decaploid).\nDistribution.\nThe species is commonly found throughout the British Isles.\nRecorded in Ireland from all 40 of the \"&lt;a href=\"Vice-county%23Ireland\"&gt;vice-counties&lt;/a&gt;\" (a system adopted by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Lloyd%20Praeger\"&gt;Praeger&lt;/a&gt; in 1901).\nCultivation.\nIt is grown as an &lt;a href=\"ornamental%20plant\"&gt;ornamental plant&lt;/a&gt; in gardens, and has become &lt;a href=\"naturalisation%20%28biology%29\"&gt;naturalised&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; as a result of cultivation. In some European countries, including parts of Germany, the plant is now under threat.\nIt is a food plant for the &lt;a href=\"Anthocharis%20cardamines\"&gt;orange tip&lt;/a&gt; butterfly (\"Anthocharis cardamines\") and makes a valuable addition to any garden which aims at attracting wildlife. It was once used as a substitute for &lt;a href=\"watercress\"&gt;watercress&lt;/a&gt;.\nFolklore.\nIn folklore it was said to be sacred to the &lt;a href=\"fairies\"&gt;fairies&lt;/a&gt;, and so was unlucky if brought indoors. It was not included in &lt;a href=\"May%20Day\"&gt;May Day&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garland\"&gt;garland&lt;/a&gt;s for the same reason.\nAdditional general information.\nIt is the &lt;a href=\"County%20flowers%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;county flower&lt;/a&gt; of the English county of &lt;a href=\"Cheshire\"&gt;Cheshire&lt;/a&gt;."
