    "text": "The 2011 &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; season was the club's 112th season in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and 111th in the &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt;. The 2011 White Sox schedule was revealed at 7:00 &lt;a href=\"post%20meridiem\"&gt;pm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Central%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;Central Time&lt;/a&gt; on September 14, 2010 along with every other team in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;.\nOffseason.\nOn December 2, 2010 the White Sox signed a new slugger &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Dunn\"&gt;Adam Dunn&lt;/a&gt; from the Washington Nationals for a 4yr/$56M contract. On that same day, the Sox also re-signed &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Pierzynski\"&gt;A. J. Pierzynski&lt;/a&gt; to a 2yr/$8M extension. Six days later, the Sox resigned &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Konerko\"&gt;Paul Konerko&lt;/a&gt; to a 3yr/$37.5M extension. With Dunn, Konerko, and Pierzynski, there is a 5% chance that the White Sox will win the &lt;a href=\"2011%20World%20Series\"&gt;2011 World Series&lt;/a&gt;. On December 15, the White Sox acquired RHP &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20Crain\"&gt;Jesse Crain&lt;/a&gt; from the Minnesota Twins and offered a 3yr/$13M deal. On January 18, the Sox acquired RHP &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Humber\"&gt;Philip Humber&lt;/a&gt; off waivers from the Oakland A's. One month prior, the A's claimed Humber from the Kansas City Royals.\nIn addition to acquisitions, the White Sox also traded away some players, including &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Linebrink\"&gt;Scott Linebrink&lt;/a&gt; to Atlanta Braves on December 3, and &lt;a href=\"J.%20J.%20Putz\"&gt;J. J. Putz&lt;/a&gt; to Arizona Diamondbacks on December 7. &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Jenks\"&gt;Bobby Jenks&lt;/a&gt;, who was non-tendered by the White Sox, has agreed to sign with the Boston Red Sox on December 16.\nRegular season.\nMonthly summaries.\nApril.\nThe Sox opened the 2011 season at Cleveland with a 15\u201310 victory over the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Indians&lt;/a&gt; on April 1. It was the first time since Sep 7, 2007 that the Sox won while allowing 10 or more runs. The Sox had their first 2\u20130 start since 2005 with an 8\u20133 win over Cleveland. In the third game of this series in the 4th inning, &lt;a href=\"Alexei%20Ram%C3%ADrez\"&gt;Alexei Ram\u00edrez&lt;/a&gt; bunted into a 3\u20134\u20136 &lt;a href=\"triple%20play\"&gt;triple play&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first time that the Sox hit into a triple play since 1978. The Sox went on to lose this game 7\u20131. On April 5 at &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Royals\"&gt;Kansas City Royals&lt;/a&gt;, the Sox scored four runs in the first inning but they would not hold on to the lead. The Sox played for &lt;a href=\"extra%20inning\"&gt;12 innings&lt;/a&gt; until the new Royals batter &lt;a href=\"Melky%20Cabrera\"&gt;Melky Cabrera&lt;/a&gt; hit a walk-off single to score the former Sox player &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Getz\"&gt;Chris Getz&lt;/a&gt; to suffer their first walk-off loss of the season. Last season, the Sox did not suffer their first walk-off loss until July 18 at Minnesota. After the loss, &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Dunn\"&gt;Adam Dunn&lt;/a&gt; had his &lt;a href=\"Vermiform%20appendix\"&gt;appendix&lt;/a&gt; removed and he'll miss five games, but he told &lt;a href=\"Ozzie%20Guill%C3%A9n\"&gt;Ozzie Guill\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt; that he wants to play sooner.

The Sox would lose the game 9\u20137. That was their first win of the season for Rays. In addition, in the top of the ninth inning after Johnson's home run, the Rays took their first lead of the season after going 62 consecutive innings without lead. It is now the most consecutive innings without lead of any team of all-time. The Sox would then go on and win the final two games of this series to take three out of four from the Rays with the final scores of 4\u20132 and 6\u20131.

In next series, the Sox got swept by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim\"&gt;Angels&lt;/a&gt; at home for the first time since 2005. The Sox finished 4\u20136 on the homestand.\nThe Sox avoided a four-game sweep by beating the Rays 9\u20132 behind &lt;a href=\"Gavin%20Floyd\"&gt;Gavin Floyd&lt;/a&gt; on April 22. Then the Sox were swept by Tigers at Detroit, including being scoreless twice. The Sox split the series against the Yankees at New York, including two straight plays by &lt;a href=\"Brent%20Lillibridge\"&gt;Brent Lillibridge&lt;/a&gt; off the bats of &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Rodr%C3%ADguez\"&gt;Alex Rodr\u00edguez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robinson%20Can%C3%B3\"&gt;Robinson Can\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; to end the game on April 26. The Sox finished their 11-game road trip 3\u20138.

Then the Sox avoided getting swept by beating the Orioles 6\u20132. Then on May 3 against the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Twins\"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Liriano\"&gt;Francisco Liriano&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"no-hitter\"&gt;no-hit&lt;/a&gt; the White Sox. Liriano threw 123 pitches with six walks and just two strikeouts. Prior to this game, Liriano had an ERA of 9.13, which is the second highest ERA before the no-hitter since 1913. After the no-hitter, his ERA dropped to 6.61. It is the Twins first no-hitter since &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Milton\"&gt;Eric Milton&lt;/a&gt; threw one on Sep 11, 1999 against the &lt;a href=\"California%20Angels\"&gt;California Angels&lt;/a&gt;.

The Sox lost again 3\u20132 on the next day to Minnesota to have the worst record in MLB at 11\u201321.\nThen the Sox went on to the west coast in &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Mariners\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Athletics\"&gt;Oakland&lt;/a&gt;, finishing 6\u20133 in that nine-game road trip.

He went 6 IP 7 H 4 ER 4 K in no decision as Sox defeated Angels 6\u20134 in 10 innings. When Peavy added to the starting rotation and &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Humber\"&gt;Philip Humber&lt;/a&gt; is too good to be moved to the bullpen, the Sox used the six-man rotation. On May 15, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Buehrle\"&gt;Mark Buehrle&lt;/a&gt; outdueled &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Cahill\"&gt;Trevor Cahill&lt;/a&gt; as Sox defeated Oakland 4\u20133.\nThe Sox went back home splitting a two-game series against the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; and swept the two-game series over the first-place Indians, including a three-hit &lt;a href=\"shutout%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;shutout&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Peavy\"&gt;Jake Peavy&lt;/a&gt; in the first game of that series in his second start of the season. On the next night, the Sox lost the first game of the series against the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; after giving up a home run to &lt;a href=\"Russ%20Mitchell%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Russell Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; in the 9th inning by &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Santos%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Sergio Santos&lt;/a&gt; which tied the game at 3.

The Sox went on to lose 13\u20134 and Danks was then 0\u20138 with a 5.25 &lt;a href=\"Earned%20run%20average\"&gt;ERA&lt;/a&gt;. With the only win in that four-game series coming in the opener of the series, the Sox had lost seven straight games in the finale of a four-game series when they won the opener and lost the next two dating back to the start of 2007 season.

The Sox were swept in a two-game series including a 1\u20130 loss. The Sox went to &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 2003, where they take two out of three.

The Sox would go on to lose 2\u20131 and the Sox lost the home series against the Nats even though the Sox swept the Nats at D.C. last season. Also in that game, Adam Dunn went 0\u20134 with four strikeouts, becoming the first big league player to strikeout 100 times this season.\nThe Sox would then head to Denver for the first time since 2005, taking two out of three from the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Rox&lt;/a&gt;, including a split in extra-inning games.

Jackson would then be traded to &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;. The Sox finished the month of July with a 12\u201312 record with a losing home record (5\u20138) but a winning road record (7\u20134).\nAugust.\nThe Sox continued their 10-game homestand started in July with four games to play against the Yankees.

The Sox took two of three from the Royals, lost two of three from the Indians, and won two of three from the Rangers, all via rock series. The Sox went to the west coast to take on the Angels and the Mariners. The Sox were swept in a two-game series against the Halos and the Sox swept the Mariners in a three-game weekend series. In the finale of that series, &lt;a href=\"Day%C3%A1n%20Viciedo\"&gt;Day\u00e1n Viciedo&lt;/a&gt; called up from &lt;a href=\"Triple-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Triple-A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20Knights\"&gt;Charlotte&lt;/a&gt; to play right field as Carlos Quentin went to the &lt;a href=\"disabled%20list\"&gt;15-day DL&lt;/a&gt;. In his second at-bat, Viciedo hit his three-run homer to make it 3\u20130 Sox. A couple innings later, &lt;a href=\"Tyler%20Flowers\"&gt;Tyler Flowers&lt;/a&gt;, who is playing for A. J. Pierzynski who is also on the 15-day DL, hit his first career &lt;a href=\"Grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;grand slam&lt;/a&gt; and his second homer of his career. It is also the first grand slam the Sox have hit this season. The Sox would go on to win this game 9\u20133 to complete the sweep. Since the start of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season\"&gt;2008 season&lt;/a&gt;, the Sox have won 23 of the last 25 games when they hit grand slam(s).\nThe Sox concluded the month by taking two out of three from the struggling Twins.

In that series, the Sox were outscored 35\u201311 in a three-game series including an 18\u20132 loss in the second game. The Sox went to Minnesota and won their first three games of a four-game series and then lost the last game that would otherwise been their first four-game sweep in Minnesota ever. In the second game of this series (second game of a &lt;a href=\"doubleheader%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubleheader&lt;/a&gt;), rookie &lt;a href=\"Zach%20Stewart\"&gt;Zach Stewart&lt;/a&gt; flirted with &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20game%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;perfecto&lt;/a&gt; as he retired the first 21 Twin batters he faced before giving up a double to &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Valencia\"&gt;Danny Valencia&lt;/a&gt;. Stewart would then go on to retire six straight to end the game with a one-hitter.\nThe Sox came back to U.S. Cellular Field to take on the Indians in a four-game set. The Sox split the series. On the morning of September 10, &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Peavy\"&gt;Jake Peavy&lt;/a&gt; decided to shut down for the rest of the season so he'll get more time to relax his lat muscles recovered from surgery and make him stronger for next season. Peavy finished the season with a 4.92 ERA in 18 starts and 1 relief appearance. Later on that day in the third game of a four-game set against the Indians, &lt;a href=\"Alex%20R%C3%ADos\"&gt;Alex R\u00edos&lt;/a&gt; hit a walk-off grand slam in the 10th inning for a 7\u20133 Sox victory. Then the Sox got ugly, they were swept by Detroit in a three-game series at home in September for the second consecutive year. In the finale of that series, the Sox led 5\u20132 going to the 9th inning and then &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Santos%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Sergio Santos&lt;/a&gt; suffered his 6th blown save of the season by giving up two home runs and preventing rookie &lt;a href=\"Dylan%20Axelrod\"&gt;Dylan Axelrod&lt;/a&gt; from picking up his first major league win. The Sox would lose in the 10th inning 6\u20135.
