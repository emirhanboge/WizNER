    "text": "The Broadway Tunnel was a &lt;a href=\"tunnel\"&gt;tunnel&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Moore\"&gt;Fort Moore Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Downtown Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;. It extended &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20%28Los%20Angeles%29\"&gt;North Broadway&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Fort Street), at Sand Street (later California Street), one block north of &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Street%20%28Los%20Angeles%29\"&gt;Temple Street&lt;/a&gt;, northeast to the intersection of Bellevue Avenue (later &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Boulevard\"&gt;Sunset Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;, now &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Chavez%20Avenue\"&gt;Cesar Chavez Avenue&lt;/a&gt;), to Buena Vista Street (now North Broadway).\nHistory.\nThe proposal for opening &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20%28Los%20Angeles%29\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; through to Buena Vista Street, and extending the street south into what was then part of &lt;a href=\"Main%20Street%20%28Los%20Angeles%29\"&gt;Main Street&lt;/a&gt;, below &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20streets%2C%201-10%23\"&gt;Tenth Street&lt;/a&gt;, in order to give a continuous, wide &lt;a href=\"thoroughfare\"&gt;thoroughfare&lt;/a&gt; from the southern &lt;a href=\"city%20limits\"&gt;city limits&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Angeles%20%28region%29\"&gt;Eastside&lt;/a&gt;, was made as early as February 1891.\nPlans were prepared by the &lt;a href=\"civil%20engineering\"&gt;city engineer&lt;/a&gt;'s office in early March 1895. The main argument for its construction was that a tunnel providing an additional opening on the north would decrease the constantly increasing &lt;a href=\"traffic\"&gt;traffic&lt;/a&gt; (horses, buggies and wagons), which was causing a dangerous &lt;a href=\"traffic%20congestion\"&gt;jam&lt;/a&gt; at the corner of &lt;a href=\"1st%20Street%20%28Los%20Angeles%29\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spring%20Street%20Financial%20District\"&gt;Spring Streets&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction.\nWork began on the Broadway Tunnel on November 2, 1899. About 25 men with &lt;a href=\"team\"&gt;team&lt;/a&gt;s (of animals) moved obstructions out of the way in preparation for the excavation, from the north approach. On the morning of January 20, 1900, a laborer was buried under about 20 tons of earth at the north end of the tunnel. The wood bracing fell over the man in such a manner that he was saved from being crushed to death.\nThe tunnel required more than 50,000 &lt;a href=\"cubic%20yard\"&gt;cubic yard&lt;/a&gt;s (38 227.75 m3) of &lt;a href=\"elevation\"&gt;elevation&lt;/a&gt;, 4,000 cubic yards (3 058.22 m3) of &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; and 1.25 million of &lt;a href=\"brickwork\"&gt;bricks&lt;/a&gt; to line it. With the exception of the tunnel in &lt;a href=\"Fairmount%20Park\"&gt;Fairmount Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, which was in &lt;a href=\"diameter\"&gt;diameter&lt;/a&gt;, but only long, the Broadway Tunnel was the widest tunnel of its type in the U.S., and possibly in the world, at that time. According to an article in the \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Times\"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;\", the Third Street Tunnel, which was also nearing completion at the time, could have been put inside the Broadway Tunnel leaving enough room for a &lt;a href=\"sidewalk\"&gt;sidewalk&lt;/a&gt; wide.\nThe Broadway Tunnel was completed and opened for traffic on Saturday, August 17, 1901. It was long, wide and high, with a &lt;a href=\"grade%20%28slope%29\"&gt;grade&lt;/a&gt; of 6 in 100, falling toward the east. The cost in its construction was $66,000.\nReconstruction.\nThe Broadway Tunnel was closed for reconstruction in 1915. The roadway was lowered to decrease the grade, wood block flooring was installed to provide a noiseless surface for the traffic of teams and &lt;a href=\"automobile\"&gt;automobile&lt;/a&gt;s, and a false roof built inside the original shell. Because of the lowering, it was necessary to make a &lt;a href=\"cut%20%28earthmoving%29\"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; of in California Street, and to change the grade of North Broadway from Temple Street to the tunnel. The concrete &lt;a href=\"arch\"&gt;arch&lt;/a&gt;way of the Broadway Tunnel was high, and the entire bore was lined with white &lt;a href=\"Ceramic%20tile\"&gt;glazed tile&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"stairway\"&gt;stairway&lt;/a&gt; on the outer face of the southern &lt;a href=\"portal%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; was extended to a rise of to Fort Moore Hill.\nThe work was completed and the Broadway Tunnel reopened in early February 1916. Due to the importance of the &lt;a href=\"arterial%20road\"&gt;artery&lt;/a&gt; of travel, through which thousands of automobiles, teams and &lt;a href=\"pedestrian\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt;s would be passing daily, an event was held on Saturday, February 19, formally turning the tunnel over to the city, with the &lt;a href=\"Automobile%20Club%20of%20Southern%20California\"&gt;Automobile Club of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; in charge.\nClosure.\nThe Broadway Tunnel was closed on June 2, 1949. It was demolished for the construction of the new &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20101%20in%20California\"&gt;Hollywood Freeway&lt;/a&gt; (U.S. Route 101) through Downtown. The route cut through Fort Moore Hill and made it necessary for a Broadway &lt;a href=\"overpass\"&gt;overpass&lt;/a&gt; to be built across the freeway at the former Broadway Tunnel site."
