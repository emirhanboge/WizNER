    "text": "FIFA Player of the Century was a one-off award created by &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; to decide the greatest &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player of the 20th century, announced at the annual FIFA World gala, held in Rome on 11 December 2000. &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Maradona\"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pel%C3%A9\"&gt;Pel\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; were joint winners of the award.\nBackground.\nSince 1955, FIFA has had awards for &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;FIFA World Player of the Year&lt;/a&gt; and they decided to bring in the new millennium by conducting a public vote to decide the FIFA Player of the Century. This was to be decided by votes on their official website, their official magazine, and a grand jury. Maradona won the Internet-based poll by wide margins, garnering 53.6% of the votes against 18.53% for Pel\u00e9. Despite the fact that &lt;a href=\"Eus%C3%A9bio\"&gt;Eus\u00e9bio&lt;/a&gt;, who played football professionally during Pel\u00e9's era, placed third in the poll, many observers complained that the Internet nature of the poll would have meant a skewed demographic of younger fans who would have seen Maradona play, but not Pel\u00e9. As a result, FIFA decided to add a second poll and appointed a \"Football Family\" committee composed of football journalists, officials, and coaches, who voted Pel\u00e9 the best player of the century with 72.75% of the vote, thus both were joint winners of the award.\nFIFA Internet vote.\nThe results of FIFA's internet Poll were as follows:\nFIFA Magazine and Grand Jury vote.\nThis part of the award was decided by the FIFA Magazine readers vote and the FIFA Grand Jury.
