    "text": "A Lariat chain is a loop of chain that hangs off, and is spun by a wheel. It is often used as a science exhibit or a toy. \nThe original Lariat Chain was created in 1986 by Norman Tuck, as an Artist-in-Residence project at the &lt;a href=\"Exploratorium\"&gt;Exploratorium&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco. \nLariat Chain was developed from an earlier Tuck piece entitled Chain Reaction (1984). Chain Reaction was hand cranked, and utilized a heavy chain attached by magnets onto an iron flywheel. As in Lariat Chain, Chain Reaction used a brush to disrupt the motion of the traveling chain. \nThe speed of the chain is arranged to equal the &lt;a href=\"group%20velocity\"&gt;wave speed&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"transverse%20wave\"&gt;transverse wave&lt;/a&gt;s, so that waves moving against the motion of the chain appear to be standing still."
