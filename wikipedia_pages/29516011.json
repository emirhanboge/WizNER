    "text": "Pyrox Island is an island lying at the head of &lt;a href=\"Neny%20Fjord\"&gt;Neny Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, along the west coast of &lt;a href=\"Graham%20Land\"&gt;Graham Land&lt;/a&gt;. First surveyed by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Antarctic%20Service\"&gt;United States Antarctic Service&lt;/a&gt; (USAS), 1939\u201341. Resurveyed in 1949 by the &lt;a href=\"Falkland%20Islands%20Dependencies%20Survey\"&gt;Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey&lt;/a&gt; (FIDS), who so named it because of pyroxenic rocks found there."
