    "text": "Pescadero (&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; for \"Fishmonger\") is an unincorporated town and &lt;a href=\"census-designated%20place\"&gt;census-designated place&lt;/a&gt; (CDP) in &lt;a href=\"San%20Mateo%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;San Mateo County, California&lt;/a&gt;, two miles (3\u00a0km) east of &lt;a href=\"State%20Route%201%20%28California%29\"&gt;State Route 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pescadero%20State%20Beach\"&gt;Pescadero State Beach&lt;/a&gt;. The town is south of &lt;a href=\"Half%20Moon%20Bay\"&gt;Half Moon Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"ZIP%20Code\"&gt;ZIP Code&lt;/a&gt; is 94060 and the community is inside &lt;a href=\"area%20code%20650\"&gt;area code 650&lt;/a&gt;. The population was 595 at the 2020 census.\nAbout.\nPescadero is a farming and ranching community near the Pescadero Marsh, a wildlife refuge. &lt;a href=\"Pescadero%20Creek\"&gt;Pescadero Creek&lt;/a&gt;, the longest stream in &lt;a href=\"San%20Mateo%20County\"&gt;San Mateo County&lt;/a&gt;, is an annual creek that empties into the Pacific Ocean near the town. Many of the buildings in town date from the 19th century. Pescadero is situated near the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, about south of &lt;a href=\"Half%20Moon%20Bay%2C%20California\"&gt;Half Moon Bay&lt;/a&gt; and about north of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Cruz%2C%20California\"&gt;Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;.\nPescadero is also a weekend tourist destination during the summer months because of beaches, parks including Memorial Park and &lt;a href=\"Butano%20State%20Park\"&gt;Butano State Park&lt;/a&gt;, Pigeon Point Lighthouse and Hostel, as well as extensive rural roads for biking and trails for hiking in the &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Cruz%20Mountains\"&gt;Santa Cruz Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Attractions include &lt;a href=\"Duarte%27s%20Tavern\"&gt;Duarte's Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, Arcangeli Grocery Co. (Norm's Market / Bakery), Sante Family Wines, Made in Pescadero (a furniture store), Downtown Local (a coffee shop), The Sunshine (a boutique grocery store), Pescadero Essentials (a health/beauty shop), South Coast Children's Services Thrift Shop, Luna Sea art gallery, the Pie Ranch Farmstand, the Pescadero Farmers Market (that runs from June through October), and Taqueria y Mercado de Amigos, an acclaimed taqueria in the local gas station.\nPescadero is host to a number of successful agricultural ventures, some of which offer high-quality produce and value-added products throughout San Mateo County and much of the Bay Area. These include: Harley Farms Goat Dairy, Blue House Farm, Tomkat Ranch, Simms Organic, Fifth Crow Farm, R &amp; R Herbs, and many others.\nPescadero hosts the annual Pescadero Art and Fun Fair (PAFF) on the third weekend of August. The Alto Velo Bicycle Racing Club holds the annual Pescadero Coastal Classic Road Race, which travels through the town and nearby countryside, in early- to mid-June.\nThe town is home to &lt;a href=\"Pescadero%20Middle%20and%20High%20School\"&gt;Pescadero Middle and High School&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1922. The Pescadero High School and Middle School teams are the Vikings and the Panthers, respectively. Pescadero Elementary School is located north of downtown.\nNon-profits in Pescadero play a central role in much of the town's economy and the well-being of its residents. Puente de la Costa Sur serves as the only resource community center in this region of San Mateo County, providing valuable aid to farmworkers and community members alike. Educational organizations such as Pie Ranch work with the state to generate land access opportunities for impoverished communities, and stimulate &lt;a href=\"regenerative%20agriculture\"&gt;regenerative agriculture&lt;/a&gt; initiatives.\n&lt;a href=\"KPDO\"&gt;KPDO&lt;/a&gt;, at 89.3 &lt;a href=\"FM%20broadcasting\"&gt;FM&lt;/a&gt;, is Pescadero's community radio station.\nPescadero Marsh.\nLocated at the confluence of Pescadero Creek and Butano Creek, the area known as Pescadero Marsh has for decades been a thriving habitat for both migratory and native wildlife. Besides being a refuge and nesting ground for wintering waterfowl, the Marsh is a critical spawning area and nursery for &lt;a href=\"coho%20salmon\"&gt;coho salmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"steelhead%20trout\"&gt;steelhead trout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20tidewater%20goby\"&gt;tidewater goby&lt;/a&gt;, and many other threatened or endangered fish, amphibian, and reptile species.\nDue to many causes, both natural and man-made, the health of Pescadero Marsh is deteriorating rapidly. Anoxic water conditions result in annual \"die-offs\" of hundreds of juvenile fish, crabs, and other species. As water levels fluctuate, many species are cut off from supportive habitat, and the entire eco-system degrades.\nSince 1998 concerned citizens and other wildlife agencies have repeatedly asked California State Parks to take immediate corrective action. The Parks department has moved to request further studies. Meanwhile, native species populations in the marsh have reached critically low levels. According to a study by Dr. Jerry Smith, San Jose State Professor, estimates in 1985 showed that 10,000 steelhead were rearing in the lagoon. As of 2008, 750 steelhead were counted in the same area.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the CDP covers an area of , 99.79% of it land and 0.21% of it water.\nDemographics.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 United States Census&lt;/a&gt; reported that Pescadero had a population of 643.

Alexander Moore (1823\u20131902), an American pioneer, built his home in Pescadero Valley in 1853. The rich, fertile soil of the valley had attracted other settlers, and in the 1860s Pescadero was a prosperous town surrounded by farms and lumber mills.\nAccording to a guidebook published by the &lt;a href=\"California%20Coastal%20Commission\"&gt;California Coastal Commission&lt;/a&gt;, the residents of Pescadero recovered a large quantity of white paint from the 1853 wreck of the clipper ship \"&lt;a href=\"Carrier%20Pigeon%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Carrier Pigeon&lt;/a&gt;\" at Pigeon Point. The paint was \"used liberally on all the town's buildings\", and residents have since maintained the tradition of painting their houses white. However, other sources credit the 1896 wreck of the steamer \"Columbia\" as the source of the white paint.\nAn article in the \"Wells Fargo Messenger\" states that a &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; salvaged from the \"Carrier Pigeon\" was laboriously hoisted up the cliffs onto the road, and put into service within a week. The coach, built in &lt;a href=\"Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Concord, New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, carried passengers and freight on the Pescadero road for the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Wells%20Fargo\"&gt;Wells Fargo Company&lt;/a&gt; for forty years, and, in 1914, was listed among the company's prized possessions.\nAnother tale relates that an Irishman named John Daly, who was employed driving pigs from Santa Cruz to Alexander Moore's Pescadero ranch, discovered some lumps of coal from the steamer \"Sea Bird\"'s cargo on the beach at Ano Nuevo. Mr. Daly endeavored to parley his discovery into money which he might spend on whiskey. Since coal deposits had been rumored to exist in the area, Mr. Daly proceeded with his lumps of coal to Santa Cruz, announcing to Captain Brannan and three others that he had discovered a coal mine at &lt;a href=\"Gazos%20Creek\"&gt;Gazos Creek&lt;/a&gt;. After collecting his monetary reward, he led the four men up Gazos Creek in search of the alleged coal outcropping, with the intention of escaping and leaving his benefactors behind empty-handed. However, Captain Brannan, who was armed, managed to capture Daly and extracted a confession. Daly was administered a whipping on the spot and later fled the area."
