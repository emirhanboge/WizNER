    "text": "Czarni Lw\u00f3w was one of the first &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; professional &lt;a href=\"sport\"&gt;sport&lt;/a&gt;s clubs with the well developed &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; section as well as &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; among the several other sports. The football club was started in the late 19th century in &lt;a href=\"Lw%C3%B3w\"&gt;Lw\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; as a school football section S\u0142awa Lw\u00f3w. In 1903 the name was changed and the club became professional.\nIn 1911, together with &lt;a href=\"KS%20Cracovia%20%28football%29\"&gt;KS Cracovia&lt;/a&gt; and two other teams, Czarni created the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Polish Football Association&lt;/a&gt;, the predecessor of the modern &lt;a href=\"PZPN\"&gt;PZPN&lt;/a&gt; national football association. The first football club in Poland, the Czarni (Black, name coined after their black shirts; because of their colours the team was commonly dubbed \"Powidlaki\"\u00a0\u2013 an allusion to the \"plum marmalade\" colour of their logo) were the best known and most popular sports club in &lt;a href=\"Lw%C3%B3w\"&gt;Lw\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; (together with &lt;a href=\"Pogo%C5%84%20Lw%C3%B3w\"&gt;Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; formed soon afterwards). The official name translates as the First Military-Civil Sport Club Blacks Lw\u00f3w. Although the main interest of the fans lay in football, soon other sections were opened (&lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skiing\"&gt;skiing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sport%20of%20athletics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;). Despite their initial successes and their contribution to the &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20football%20in%20Poland\"&gt;history of football in Poland&lt;/a&gt;, the club was largely unsuccessful in league meetings. During their seven years career in the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Polish Football League&lt;/a&gt;, they scored 141 points, with the total goal quota of 120:186. In 1928 the club came 8th in the league, which was the highest location in its history. However, the following year Czarni's forward &lt;a href=\"Rochus%20Nastula\"&gt;Rochus Nastula&lt;/a&gt; was the top scorer in Polish Soccer League, with 25 goals scored in one season. In 1933 the club dropped from the first league, but continued to appear in national championships.\nIn 1935 the club won the Polish Cup (\"Mistrzostwa Polski\"). In the same year the club won also the Polish &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; title. In 1936 the name was changed back to \"Military and Civil Sports Club S\u0142awa Lw\u00f3w\". It was disbanded in 1939 by the &lt;a href=\"NKVD\"&gt;NKVD&lt;/a&gt; who arrested most of its members. The most famous player of Czarni Lw\u00f3w was &lt;a href=\"Kazimierz%20G%C3%B3rski\"&gt;Kazimierz G\u00f3rski&lt;/a&gt;."
