    "text": "Yin Chang or In-ch'ang (; 1859\u20131928) was a military official, ambassador to Germany, and educational reformer in the &lt;a href=\"Qing%20Dynasty\"&gt;Qing Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. He was appointed the nation's first Minister of War in the late Qing Dynasty. During the Republic he served as the military Chief of Staff for all of the subsequent presidents in the Beiyang Government. He was &lt;a href=\"Manchu%20people\"&gt;ethnic Manchu&lt;/a&gt;, and his family belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Plain%20White%20Banner\"&gt;Plain White Banner&lt;/a&gt; Clan of the &lt;a href=\"Manchu%20Military%20Organization\"&gt;Manchu Military Organization&lt;/a&gt; (\u6eff\u6d32\u6b63\u767d\u65d7); he held the title of Prince of that clan; at court he was addressed as Wu-lou.\nBiography.\nIn the Qing Dynasty.\nOriginally Yin Chang was a student of the &lt;a href=\"Guozijian\"&gt;Guozijian&lt;/a&gt;, and by 1872 he was studying German at the &lt;a href=\"Tongwen%20Guan\"&gt;Tongwen Guan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beijing\"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;. In 1877 he was sent to Germany as an attach\u00e9 to the Chinese Legation in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. During his stay in Germany he studied military science as a fellow student with Crown Prince Wilhelm II. He formed an association with the &lt;a href=\"Krupp\"&gt;Krupp&lt;/a&gt; family, producers of ammunition and armament. Georg von der Gabelentz, the founding father of German Sinology, acknowledged his friendship with Yin Chang in the introduction of his 1883 publication, \u201cChinesische Grammatik\u201d praising his work in reviewing the manuscripts and command of German grammar. While in Berlin he married a German woman, with whom he had a daughter.\nIn 1884 Yin Chang returned to China and was appointed to the Tientsin Naval Academy; that December he was assigned to serve as translator for the German military envoy to the Emperor. By June 1885 Yin Chang was appointed an instructor in military science at the Tientsin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802), introducing German officers to teach the study and practice of German military techniques. The following year he was promoted to superintendent of the Academy. The future President of the Republic of China, &lt;a href=\"Feng%20Guozhang\"&gt;Feng Guozhang&lt;/a&gt;, was a student under his direction.\nAfter the first Sino-Japanese War (1884-1885) Germany entered the negotiations of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and used the assassination of two German missionaries to claim the Concession of Kiaochow Bay in Shandong Province. In 1898, Prince &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281862%E2%80%931929%29\"&gt;Heinrich&lt;/a&gt; of Prussia, with his East Asia Naval Squadron, sailed into Tientsin. Yin Chang was summoned to negotiate German claims on the region of Kiaochow Bay and the port of Tsingtao. Yin Chang turned Prince Heinrich\u2019s mission into a diplomatic rather than military success, by making him the first foreign potentate to be received by the imperial court. In the winter of 1899, Yin Chang headed the negotiations with Germany for railway and mining rights in &lt;a href=\"Shandong\"&gt;Shandong&lt;/a&gt; (\u5c71\u6771\u8def\u7926\u7ae0\u7a0b) province, and the concession in Tsingtao.His negotiations became part of the Boxer Protocol, signed on September 7, 1901 in Beijing. Subsequently these terms were integrated into the Tientsin Protocol, which in 1918 became part of the peace treaty with Germany that ended World War I.\nIt is said that during the &lt;a href=\"Boxer%20Rebellion\"&gt;Boxer Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, when the troops of the &lt;a href=\"Eight-Nation%20Alliance\"&gt;Eight-Nation Alliance&lt;/a&gt; stormed Beijing to relieve the besieged Legations, Yin Chang, with his German-equipped soldiers, escorted the Emperor Guangxu and the &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Dowager%20Cixi\"&gt;Empress Dowager Cixi&lt;/a&gt; to safe passage through the back gates of the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20City\"&gt;Forbidden City&lt;/a&gt; into the safety of &lt;a href=\"Shaanxi%20Province\"&gt;Shaanxi Province&lt;/a&gt;, where the foreigners could not reach them.\nIn 1901 Yin Chang was named Lieutenant-General of the Plain White Banner Garrison \u00a0(\u6b63\u767d\u65d7\u6f22\u8ecd\u526f\u90fd\u7d71) That August 1901 he was appointed the Chinese Ambassador to Germany (Berlin). Additionally, in September 1901, by Imperial Edict, Yin Chang was charged with accompanying &lt;a href=\"Zaifeng%2C%20Prince%20Chun\"&gt;Zaifeng, Prince Chun&lt;/a&gt; to Germany with the special mission to convey China's regret to Kaiser Wilhelm II for the murder of Baron &lt;a href=\"Clemens%20von%20Ketteler\"&gt;Clemens von Ketteler&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Boxer%20Rebellion\"&gt;Boxer Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. The mission proved an unexpected success, with Prince Chun, the first member of the Imperial family to venture outside China, eagerly awaited by curious, enthusiastic crowds. After some negotiation the Kaiser accorded Prince Chun a splendid reception and delighted with the young prince, invited him to review the military maneuvers of 50,000 troops in Danzig. The international press covered his every step which caused the Empress Dowager some anxiety thus curtailing the rest of his European tour.\nAs ambassador Yin Chang was a polyglot, brought up in Manchu and Chinese (Mandarin), and in addition to his mastery of German, he knew French, the diplomatic language, and English. The Kaiser and his court were charmed by his command of the Berlin dialect making him a popular figure. During Ambassador Yin Chang's time in Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm II took a personal interest in the problems of modernizing a country\u2019s military forces. The Kaiser taught Yin Chang much about the organization, training, discipline, and the equipment of a modern army. Also during this time, Yin Chang was asked to step in as ambassador to the Netherlands for a term. Back in Germany he arranged a state visit to China for &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Adalbert%20of%20Prussia%20%281884%E2%80%931948%29\"&gt;Prince Adalbert of Prussia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1905 he was recalled to China and appointed the director of the Nobles' College (\u8cb4\u5191\u5b78\u5802\u7e3d\u8fa6) in Beijing. Since Yin Chang had cut his hair, he attached a wig braid to his official hat worn during his frequent summons at court, much to the disapproval of the old bureaucrats. He began his campaign for modernization first by changing the traditional uniforms of the Chinese Army to uniforms modeled on those of the German Army. For equipment, he ordered arms and ammunition from &lt;a href=\"Krupp\"&gt;Krupp&lt;/a&gt;. Most importantly, Yin Chang was one of the reformers who abolished the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Examination\"&gt;Imperial Examination&lt;/a&gt; in his effort to modernize Chinese education. This had far-reaching effects; supplanting the Confucian classics opened the curriculum to all the modern disciplines of the sciences and humanities. Instead of aiming solely for civil service appointments, now students could pursue their own interests and choose a profession, including the military.\nIn September 1906 Yin Chang became Commander-in-Chief in Jiangbei (\u6c5f\u5317\u63d0\u7763), and two months later, became Army Chief of Staff (\u9678\u8ecd\u90e8\u53f3\u4f8d\u90ce). By September 1908 he was reappointed as Chinese Ambassador to Germany, but because of the autumn military maneuvers in Anhwei he delayed his departure. Then the sudden death of the Emperor Guangxu on November 14, followed by the death of the Dowager Empress Cixi on the 15th, and the subsequent investiture of Zaifeng, Prince Qing as Regent, Yin Chang could not proceed to his post until Spring 1909. The Prince Regent, Zaifeng wanted to execute Yuan Shih Kai for his betrayal of his brother the Emperor Guangxu and the 100 Days Reform. Yin Chang pleaded on Yuan Shih Kai's behalf and Prince Zaifeng commuted his sentence which was to be exile from Beijing. On his arrival in Berlin with his wife and entourage, Yin Chang, in General\u2019s dress, with monocle and sword, was welcomed as a social luminary. In 1910 Yin Chang was recalled to China to take up the position of acting President of the Board of War (\u9678\u8ecd\u90e8\u5c1a\u66f8).\nIn the Xinhai Revolution and the Beiyang Government.\nIn September 1910 Yin Chang became the Chief of Staff of all the Army divisions stationed in the vicinity of Beijing (\u8a13\u7df4\u8fd1\u757f\u9678\u8ecd\u5404\u93ae\u5927\u81e3). Three months later, Yin Chang was appointed the first Minister of War in &lt;a href=\"Yikuang\"&gt;Prince Qing&lt;/a&gt;'s Cabinet and he consolidated the different branches of the military under his aegis. As Minister of War Yin Chang set out to achieve three objectives: 1) greater efficiency and economy in his ministry; 2) improvement to the military profession; 3) establishing a national chain of command for the military under the ministry. To instill a sense of professionalism he ordered all officers to wear uniforms at work and to use military salutes on all occasions, official and civil. He succeeded in fostering a sense of patriotism throughout the Army as evidenced by a new respect and pride in the military profession. As the first Minister of War, Yin Chang was dedicated to educating the population of the country with general information about the military and the function and responsibilities of the army. He wanted to create a sense of patriotism by making the military a subject in schools, and the Imperial University added a military course to the curriculum. He required military drills and instruction as well as physical education included in the curriculum of middle and primary schools. Yin Chang\u2019s efforts at reform encountered opposition from traditionalists, officials protecting their interests and sinecures, and provincial governments guarding their power. The Manchu Dynasty fell before the results of his work became evident. Different aspects of it were taken up by succeeding regimes for their own purposes.\nIn May 1911 Yin Chang attained the rank of full general but also remained in the Cabinet. On the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution\"&gt;Xinhai Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in August of that year, General Yin Chang was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial forces and sent &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Yangxia\"&gt;to quell the revolutionary army&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hubei\"&gt;Hubei&lt;/a&gt;. However, as soon as he reached the front, his command of the army of the Qing Dynasty was countermanded by Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Yuan%20Shikai\"&gt;Yuan Shi Kai&lt;/a&gt; (Chinese vs Manchu), thus leaving vital weapons and ammunition factories unprotected. It extinguished all hopes of a constitutional monarchy. On his return to Beijing he was appointed Chief of the General Staff but resigned from his post as Yuan Shih Kai established his Cabinet. It has been speculated that had Marshal Yin Chang been allowed to remain in Hubeii, the revolution might not have been a success. When the monarchy was abolished on Feb. 12, 1912, Yin Chang resigned his post in the cabinet marking the Day of the Princes: one Mongol and eight Manchu princes collectively resigned.\nWith the establishment of the Republic of China, on March 10, when Yuan Shih Kai became the interim President in Beijing, \u00a0the Beyang government appointed Yin Chang as \u00a0High Diplomatic Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also took on the responsibility of special envoy between the small court at the palace and the Beiyang Republic. \u00a0In December 1912 Yin Chang was reinstated a full general while also serving as Military Chief of Staff to President Yuan Shih Kai (\u7e3d\u7d71\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u8655\u8655\u9577). Yin Chang, following the cautionary example of other officials of the Empire, felt the need to purchase property in German controlled Tsingtau in 1913. When the Senate was established for the Republic, May 1914, \u00a0the first members were sworn in at Guanyue Temple the following January 13, 1915, with Yin Chang supervising the taking of the oath of office on behalf of President Yuan Shih Kai. In May 1915, Yuan Shih Kai abandoned the national anthem promulgated by Sun Yat-Sen, and launched a new national anthem for the Republic of China, \u201cChina stands heroically in the universe\u2026.\u201d(1915-1921) the lyrics \u00a0by general Yin Chang, music by Wang Lu. In these years, Yuan Shih Kai bestowed his seventh daughter, the beautiful Yuan-Fu Zhen, on Yin Chang\u2019s son, Yin Tie-Ge also known as Yin Chang, thus forming an alliance. When despite all of Yin Chang\u2019s efforts to dissuade him, Yuan Shih Kai declared himself Emperor in August 1915, he resigned from the government. After Yuan Shih Kai\u2019s death the following June 1916, Yin Chang resumed his position as military chief of Staff under President Yuanhong.\nWhen on the morning of July 1, 1917, the royalist general Zhang Xun\u2019s army entered \u00a0Beijing and proclaimed the restoration of Puyi as Emperor of China, Yin Chang resigned from the Republic and entered the Forbidden City to become Commander of the Imperial Guard. After ten day when this restoration failed, leaving Yin Chang with no alternative, he attempted suicide. Officially he remained the chief military advisor, and resuming his duties in October, he was awarded a first class golden medal.\nBy December 1917, Yin Chang was reinstated Chief of the General Staff for the Republic. In January 1919 he was reappointed to Military Chief of Staff to the President by &lt;a href=\"Xu%20Shichang\"&gt;Xu Shichang&lt;/a&gt;, a position he held for succeeding presidents Li Yuan-hung, Feng Kuo-chang, and Hau Shih- chang. In 1922 on the 21st of October, Yin Chang, representing the Republic, attended deposed Emperor Pu Yi's wedding to Princess Wanrong of Gobulo House of the Plain White Banner Clan. At the reception after the ceremony, speaking as a private citizen, Yin Chang (as a Manchu) reaffirmed his loyalty to Pu Yi. In the last years of his life he served as Military Adviser to Generalissimo &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt;. In October 1923 he was awarded the title of Marshal with \"Zhuang Wei\" (\u838a\u5a01\u5c07). He died in Beijing in 1928."
