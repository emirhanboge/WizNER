    "text": "Austad is a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20former%20municipalities%20of%20Norway\"&gt;former municipality&lt;/a&gt; of the former &lt;a href=\"Vest-Agder\"&gt;Vest-Agder&lt;/a&gt; county, &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. The municipality existed from 1909 until its dissolution in 1963. The municipality encompassed the area surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Rosfjorden\"&gt;Rosfjorden&lt;/a&gt; in the southern, coastal part of the present-day municipality of &lt;a href=\"Lyngdal\"&gt;Lyngdal&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"administrative%20centre\"&gt;administrative centre&lt;/a&gt; of the municipality was the village of &lt;a href=\"Austad%2C%20Lyngdal\"&gt;Austad&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Austad%20Church%20%28Lyngdal%29\"&gt;Austad Church&lt;/a&gt; is located.\nName.\nThe municipality (originally the &lt;a href=\"prestegjeld\"&gt;parish&lt;/a&gt;) is named after the old \"Austad\" farm (). The first element of the name is derived from the male name \"\" and the last element is \"stad\" () which means \"homestead\" or \"&lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHistory.\nAustad municipality was created on 1 January 1909 when the old municipality of &lt;a href=\"Lyngdal\"&gt;Lyngdal&lt;/a&gt; was divided into three separate municipalities: &lt;a href=\"Lyngdal\"&gt;Lyngdal&lt;/a&gt;, Austad, and &lt;a href=\"Kv%C3%A5s%20%28municipality%29\"&gt;Kv\u00e5s&lt;/a&gt;. Upon its creation, Austad had a population of 1,263. On 7 January 1916, there was a small border adjustment which transferred a small area (population: 4) from Austad to the neighboring municipality of &lt;a href=\"Spind\"&gt;Spind&lt;/a&gt;. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the &lt;a href=\"Schei%20Committee\"&gt;Schei Committee&lt;/a&gt;. On 1 January 1963, Austad and Kv\u00e5s were re-incorporated into Lyngdal along with the Gitlev\u00e5gomr\u00e5det area of &lt;a href=\"Spangereid\"&gt;Spangereid&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the merger, Austad had a population of 608.\nGovernment.\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Austad, are responsible for &lt;a href=\"primary%20education\"&gt;primary education&lt;/a&gt; (through 10th grade), outpatient &lt;a href=\"Health%20care\"&gt;health services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"old%20age\"&gt;senior citizen&lt;/a&gt; services, &lt;a href=\"unemployment\"&gt;unemployment&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Social%20work\"&gt;social services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zoning\"&gt;zoning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"economic%20development\"&gt;economic development&lt;/a&gt;, and municipal &lt;a href=\"road\"&gt;road&lt;/a&gt;s. The municipality was governed by a &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20council%20%28Norway%29\"&gt;municipal council&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Direct%20election\"&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt; representatives, which &lt;a href=\"Indirect%20election\"&gt;in turn elected&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt;. \nMunicipal council.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20council%20%28Norway%29\"&gt;municipal council&lt;/a&gt; of Austad was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms. The &lt;a href=\"Political%20party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows:"
