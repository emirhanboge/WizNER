    "title": "Town hall",
    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"local%20government\"&gt;local government&lt;/a&gt;, a city hall, town hall, civic centre (in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;), guildhall, or a municipal building (in the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;), is the chief &lt;a href=\"administration%20%28government%29\"&gt;administrative&lt;/a&gt; building of a city, town, or other &lt;a href=\"municipality\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt;. It usually houses the &lt;a href=\"City%20council\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"town%20council\"&gt;town council&lt;/a&gt;, its associated departments, and their employees. It also usually functions as the base of the &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; of a city, town, &lt;a href=\"borough\"&gt;borough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"county\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"shire\"&gt;shire&lt;/a&gt;. Other terms in non-English languages are Mairie or H\u00f4tel de ville (&lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;), Gemeindehaus or Rathaus (&lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;), R\u00e5dhus (&lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;), Pa\u00e7os do Concelho (&lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;) and Stadshus (&lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;).\nBy convention, until the middle of the 19th century, a single large open chamber (or \"hall\") formed an integral part of the building housing the council. The hall may be used for council meetings and other significant events. This large chamber, the \"town hall\" (and its later variant \"city hall\") has become synonymous with the whole building, and with the administrative body housed in it. The terms \"council chambers\", \"municipal building\" or variants may be used locally in preference to \"town hall\" if no such large hall is present within the building.\nThe local government may endeavor to use the building to promote and enhance the &lt;a href=\"quality%20of%20life\"&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt; of the community. In many cases, \"town halls\" serve not only as buildings for government functions, but also have facilities for various civic and cultural activities. These may include art shows, stage performances, exhibits and festivals. Modern town halls or \"civic centres\" are often designed with a great variety and flexibility of purpose in mind. In some European countries, the town hall is the venue for the declaration of &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20Peace\"&gt;Christmas Peace&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Turku\"&gt;Turku&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porvoo\"&gt;Porvoo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tartu\"&gt;Tartu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs symbols of local government, city and town halls have distinctive architecture, and the buildings may have great historical significance for example the &lt;a href=\"Guildhall%2C%20London\"&gt;Guildhall, London&lt;/a&gt;. City hall buildings may also serve as &lt;a href=\"cultural%20icon\"&gt;cultural icon&lt;/a&gt;s that symbolize their cities.\nNomenclature.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20countries\"&gt;Commonwealth countries&lt;/a&gt;, the term \"town hall\" may be used even in a city. This is often the case in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (examples being &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Manchester Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Liverpool Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Sydney Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere.\nPeople in some regions use the term \"city hall\" to designate the council offices of a &lt;a href=\"municipality\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"city%20status\"&gt;city status&lt;/a&gt;. This is the case in &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, where a distinction is made between city halls and town halls. The term is also sometimes (but more rarely) used as a name in Commonwealth countries: for example, for the City Halls of &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20City%20Hall\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, and of &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%2C%20Cardiff\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%2C%20Norwich\"&gt;Norwich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%2C%20Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%2C%20Dublin\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, Ireland, is another example. &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%2C%20Southwark\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt; in London, opened in 2002, is an exceptional case, being the seat not of a conventional municipal authority, but of a regional strategic authority.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Oxford%20English%20Dictionary\"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;\" sums up the generic terms:\n&lt;a href=\"County%20Council\"&gt;County Council&lt;/a&gt; administrations in parts of &lt;a href=\"England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;England and Wales&lt;/a&gt; generally operate from a base in a building called, by analogy, a \"&lt;a href=\"county%20hall\"&gt;county hall&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"shire hall\". Conversely, cities that have subdivisions with their own councils may have &lt;a href=\"borough\"&gt;borough&lt;/a&gt; halls. &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20local%20government\"&gt;Scottish local government&lt;/a&gt; in larger cities operates from the \"City Chambers\", otherwise the \"Town House\".\nOther names are occasionally used. The administrative headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt; retains its Anglo-Saxon name, the &lt;a href=\"Guildhall%2C%20London\"&gt;Guildhall&lt;/a&gt;, signifying a place where taxes were paid. In a few English cities (including &lt;a href=\"Council%20House%2C%20Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Council%20House%2C%20Coventry\"&gt;Coventry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20Council%20House\"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;) the preferred term is \"Council House\": this was also true in &lt;a href=\"Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; until 2012, when the building was renamed \"&lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%2C%20Bristol\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt;\". In Birmingham, there is a distinction between the Council House and the &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;, a concert and meeting venue which pre-dates it. In &lt;a href=\"Sheffield\"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;, the distinction is between the &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of local government, and the &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20City%20Hall\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt;, a concert and ballroom venue. In &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;, built in the 1850s as a seat of local government, now functions primarily as a concert, conference, and wedding venue, many of its municipal functions having moved in 1933 to the new &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Civic%20Hall\"&gt;Civic Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLarge halls called &lt;a href=\"basilica\"&gt;basilica&lt;/a&gt;s were used in &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Rome\"&gt;ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt; for the administration of justice, as meeting places, and for trade.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Early Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"great%20hall\"&gt;great hall&lt;/a&gt;, a single large open chamber, was the main, and sometimes \"only\" room of the home of a &lt;a href=\"feudal%20lord\"&gt;feudal lord&lt;/a&gt;. There the lord lived with his family and retinue, ate, slept, and administered rule and justice. Activities in the hall played an essential role in the functioning of the feudal manor, the administrative unit of society. As manorial dwellings developed into &lt;a href=\"manor%20house\"&gt;manor house&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"palace\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt;s, the great hall remained an essential unit within the architectural complex.\nIn the later Middle Ages or &lt;a href=\"early%20modern%20period\"&gt;early modern period&lt;/a&gt;, many European &lt;a href=\"market%20town\"&gt;market town&lt;/a&gt;s erected communal &lt;a href=\"market%20hall\"&gt;market hall&lt;/a&gt;s, comprising a covered space to function as a &lt;a href=\"marketplace\"&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt; at street level, and one or more rooms used for public or civic purposes above it. These buildings were frequently the precursors of dedicated town halls.\nThe modern concept of the town hall developed with the rise of local or regional government. Cities administered by a group of elected or chosen representatives, rather than by a lord or princely ruler, required a place for them to meet. The &lt;a href=\"Cologne%20City%20Hall\"&gt;Cologne City Hall&lt;/a&gt; of 1135 is a prominent example of the municipal autonomy of medieval cities. The &lt;a href=\"Palazzo%20Pubblico\"&gt;Palazzo Pubblico&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Siena\"&gt;Republic of Siena&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Palazzo%20Vecchio\"&gt;Palazzo Vecchio&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Florence\"&gt;Republic of Florence&lt;/a&gt;, both town halls, date from 1297 and 1299 respectively. In each case, the large, fortified building comprises a large meeting hall and numerous administrative chambers. Both buildings are topped by very tall towers, have ancient clocks by which the townsfolk can regulate their lives, and have storerooms for &lt;a href=\"muniment\"&gt;muniment&lt;/a&gt;s. These features became standard for town halls across Europe. The 15th-century &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Brussels Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;, with its tower, is one of the grandest examples of the medieval era, serving as a model for 19th-century town halls such as the &lt;a href=\"Rathaus%2C%20Vienna\"&gt;Rathaus, Vienna&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 19th century, town halls often included reading rooms to provide free education to the public, and it later became customary for the council to establish and maintain a &lt;a href=\"public%20library\"&gt;public library&lt;/a&gt;. The grand chamber or meeting place, the \"town hall\" itself, became a place for receptions, banquets, balls, and public entertainment. Town halls were often equipped with large &lt;a href=\"pipe%20organ\"&gt;pipe organ&lt;/a&gt;s to facilitate public recitals.\nIn the 20th century, town halls have served the public as places for voting, examinations, &lt;a href=\"vaccinations\"&gt;vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;, relief in times of disaster, and for posting lists of war casualties, as well as for the more usual civil functions, festivities, and entertainments. Local councils have increasingly tended to move administrative functions into modern offices. Where new premises are designed and constructed to house local governments, the functions of an administrative office and of a civic town hall have become separated.\nLanguage.\nParticularly in North America, \"city hall\" can be used as a &lt;a href=\"metonym\"&gt;metonym&lt;/a&gt; to mean &lt;a href=\"municipal%20government\"&gt;municipal government&lt;/a&gt;, or government in general, as in the &lt;a href=\"axiom\"&gt;axiom&lt;/a&gt; \"You can't fight city hall\". \"Town hall\" tends to have less formal connotations (cf. &lt;a href=\"Town%20meeting\"&gt;Town meeting&lt;/a&gt;)."
