    "text": "The Justice Party was an &lt;a href=\"Indo-Guyanese\"&gt;Indo-Guyanese&lt;/a&gt; political party in &lt;a href=\"British%20Guiana\"&gt;British Guiana&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe party was set up in 1964 with assistance from the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;, and was led by Jai Narine Singh and &lt;a href=\"Balram%20Singh%20Rai\"&gt;Balram Singh Rai&lt;/a&gt;. The American government hoped the new party, together with the &lt;a href=\"Guiana%20United%20Muslim%20Party\"&gt;Guiana United Muslim Party&lt;/a&gt; (which the British government was funding), would take votes from the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Progressive%20Party%20%28Guyana%29\"&gt;People's Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; (PPP), whose left-wing leanings they were concerned about. Although the CIA estimated that the Justice Party and GUMP could win three seats in the &lt;a href=\"1964%20British%20Guiana%20general%20election\"&gt;1964 general elections&lt;/a&gt;, neither did; the Justice Party received only 0.6% of the vote and failed to win a seat, whilst the PPP emerged as the largest party, but was unable to form a government.\nThe party did not contest any further elections."
