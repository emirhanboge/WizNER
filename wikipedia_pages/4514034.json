Briers was dropped following the return of Goulding to the starting lineup, and learned that he might not even be included in the squad for the upcoming Challenge Cup final. Seeking regular first-team football, he joined &lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Wolves\"&gt;Warrington Wolves&lt;/a&gt; in April 1997 for a fee of \u00a365,000.\nWarrington.\nBriers made an instant impact at his new club. His presence as a added an attacking edge to the Warrington team and he was nominated for Young Player of the Year in his first season at &lt;a href=\"Wilderspool%20Stadium\"&gt;Wilderspool Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Having made his &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; d\u00e9but in 1998, Briers went on to make 23 appearances for his country and featured in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2000 Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Briers was capped by Great Britain against France in their 42-12 win on 26 October 2001. Briers went on to become the primary playmaker of the Warrington team, and was named as captain in 2003. During that time Briers became well known for his excellent kicking skills and his ability to successfully convert drop goals. He currently holds the Super League record, and jointly Warrington all-time record (with Paul Bishop), for the most drop goals in a game (5 against &lt;a href=\"Halifax%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"the%20Shay\"&gt;the Shay&lt;/a&gt; in 2002).\nBriers' &lt;a href=\"Testimonial%20match\"&gt;Testimonial match&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Wolves\"&gt;Warrington&lt;/a&gt; took place in 2007 and he stepped down as captain at the end of the season.

He went on to captain Wales in the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Four%20Nations\"&gt;2011 Four Nations&lt;/a&gt;, before once again retiring from international rugby league at the tournament's end.\nThe 2011 Super League season was Briers' 14th. During this season he broke a number of club records including top all-time points scorer, having overtaken club greats &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Bevan\"&gt;Brian Bevan&lt;/a&gt;, and Steve Hesford. He broke the record during a Challenge Cup home 112\u20130 demolition of &lt;a href=\"Swinton%20Lions\"&gt;Swinton&lt;/a&gt;. This match also saw Briers break his own club record for points in a match (set 11 years earlier against York), with 44 points, from 16 goals and three tries. \nHe played in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Challenge%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2012 Challenge Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; victory over the &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds Rhinos&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe played in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Super%20League%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2012 Super League Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; defeat by the &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds Rhinos&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2013, during the second match of the season against Wigan Warriors, Lee suffered a neck injury which saw the Warrington ace out for 13 games. He returned for a Tetley's Challenge Cup fifth round tie against Salford City Reds in which he made not only a try scoring return but also kicked his 1,000th career goal.\nHe played in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Super%20League%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2013 Super League Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; defeat by the &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Warriors\"&gt;Wigan Warriors&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 2013, although Briers had a year remaining on his contract, he announced his retirement due to a neck injury. He played 425 games for Warrington, scoring a club record 2,586 points. Shortly before announcing his retirement, Briers released his autobiography, \"Off the Cuff\"."
