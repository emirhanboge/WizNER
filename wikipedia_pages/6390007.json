After leaving the &lt;a href=\"Cumbernauld\"&gt;Cumbernauld&lt;/a&gt; side in 2005, Halliwell spent the next six years playing for seven different Scottish clubs, culminating in a loan spell back at &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20F.C.\"&gt;Clyde&lt;/a&gt; from former rivals &lt;a href=\"Partick%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Partick Thistle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter being released by the &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; side, Halliwell moved into the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Junior&lt;/a&gt; ranks with Sauchie, then &lt;a href=\"Shettleston%20F.C.\"&gt;Shettleston&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nHe began his career at the now defunct &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%20F.C.\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt;, but it was at &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20F.C.\"&gt;Clyde&lt;/a&gt;, whom he joined in 2000, where he established himself. Halliwell remained with Clyde for five years, and in 2005 signed for &lt;a href=\"Dunfermline%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Dunfermline Athletic&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Halliwell's Dunfermline career, &lt;a href=\"Allan%20McGregor\"&gt;Allan McGregor&lt;/a&gt; was signed on loan from &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;Englishman&lt;/a&gt; slipped to being second-choice goalkeeper.

At the end of his month-long deal, Halliwell was released before the transfer window shut allowing him to sign for another club at any time outwith the window.\nIn the middle of November 2009, Halliwell signed for &lt;a href=\"Forfar%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Forfar Athletic&lt;/a&gt;, subsequently moving to &lt;a href=\"Partick%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Partick Thistle&lt;/a&gt; in January 2010. In February 2011, having lost his place in the Partick team, Halliwell returned to his former club Clyde, on loan till the end of the season. He was released by \"Thistle\" at the end of the season.\nIn August 2011, after 11 seasons in the senior ranks, the Englishman signed for &lt;a href=\"Clackmannanshire\"&gt;Clackmannanshire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Junior&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Sauchie%20F.C.\"&gt;Sauchie&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 20 August 2014, he signed a short-term contract with &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hearts&lt;/a&gt; to provide emergency cover during a goalkeeping crisis.\nAfter a spell in the junior ranks with Gartcairn, Halliwell appeared for &lt;a href=\"Forfar%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Forfar Athletic&lt;/a&gt; as a trialist on 11 March 2017 in a 2\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Edinburgh City&lt;/a&gt; following a suspension to regular keeper &lt;a href=\"Grant%20Adam\"&gt;Grant Adam&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe returned to Morton on loan from Gartcairn as cover for &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Gaston\"&gt;Derek Gaston&lt;/a&gt;.\nHonours.\nClyde\nDunfermline Athletic\nHamilton Academical\nSauchie\nShettleston"
