    "text": "Puppy is the fifth and final album by &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"Fluke%20%28band%29\"&gt;Fluke&lt;/a&gt;, first released on 18 August 2003. The album contains a variety of genres, spanning from &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ambient%20music\"&gt;ambient&lt;/a&gt; and even including a &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt; track, \"Blue Sky\".\nOverview.\nAfter \"Risotto\", Mike Tournier left the group to form &lt;a href=\"Syntax%20%28band%29\"&gt;Syntax&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Burton\"&gt;Jan Burton&lt;/a&gt;. Mike Bryant and Jon Fugler went on to produce Fluke's final studio album, \"Puppy\", without Tournier's help.\nThere were still signs of life in Fluke's production studio when, in 2000, they produced a &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Records\"&gt;Virgin Records&lt;/a&gt;-distributed promotional CD named \"The Xmas Demos\", which included early versions of many of the tracks intended for the album \"Puppy\". Four of the tracks on \"The Xmas Demos\" would appear on \"Puppy\", while the remaining tracks, \"Liquid\" and the original \"Another Kind of Blues\", did not make the final cut. The release of \"Puppy\" was significantly delayed by a change to the band's record label, switching from Virgin Records offshoot Circa to &lt;a href=\"One%20Little%20Indian\"&gt;One Little Indian&lt;/a&gt;. Speculation about a new album was furthered when, in 2003, the remaining members of Fluke released two singles forming the basis of this next album. Though the aptly titled \"&lt;a href=\"Slap%20It%20%28Fluke%20song%29\"&gt;Slap It: The Return&lt;/a&gt;\" signaled a break from the past, with the writing credits listed simply as \"Bryant/Fugler\" under the Appalooso label, \"&lt;a href=\"Pulse%20%28Fluke%20song%29\"&gt;Pulse&lt;/a&gt;\" exemplified a much darker style and was released on the One Little Indian label. In 2003, Fluke finally released their fifth studio album and first without Mike Tournier, \"Puppy\", six years after their previous effort \"Risotto\". The name of the album was inspired by &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Koons\"&gt;Jeff Koons&lt;/a&gt;' fifty foot sculpture of a puppy that stands outside the &lt;a href=\"Guggenheim%20Museum%20Bilbao\"&gt;Guggenheim&lt;/a&gt; museum in &lt;a href=\"Bilbao\"&gt;Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Snapshot\" was featured in ' while \"Switch/Twitch\" is featured in '. The latter song was the only single to be released from \"Puppy\" after the album's release, and was distributed in CD and vinyl formats. However, it achieved nowhere near the critical or popular acclaim of the singles from \"Risotto\", not even appearing in the UK top 40. \"Another Kind of Blues\" and \"My Spine\" were also featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Total%20Club%20Manager%202004\"&gt;Total Club Manager 2004&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Another Kind of Blues\" is a 4:37 edit of previously released promotional single, \"&lt;a href=\"Slap%20It%20%28Fluke%20song%29\"&gt;Slap It&lt;/a&gt;\" (original length 10:19). Another version, renamed \"Zion\", was used for the underground rave scene in the 2003 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Matrix%20Reloaded\"&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Puppy\"'s \"Another Kind of Blues\" is an entirely different song from the track of the same name included on the \"Xmas Demos\".\nThe track \"YKK\" was used in the 2010 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Experiment%20%282010%20film%29\"&gt;The Experiment&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe number of Fluke's live shows decreased significantly after the release of \"Puppy\" owing to their personal commitments to young families. In the few shows since, they have opted for the Fluke DJs set up, which uses \"a battery of laptops and the odd deck\" rather than focusing on their live band, an approach which Jon Fugler subsequently referred to as \"good fun, but ultimately flawed for the dancefloor.\"\nReception.\nThe album was not received well critically with most of the critics labelling the album as dated.
