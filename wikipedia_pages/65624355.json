    "text": "Jan Kamen\u00edk (born 25 January 1982) is a Czech &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; manager who manages &lt;a href=\"FC%20Vyso%C4%8Dina%20Jihlava\"&gt;FC Vyso\u010dina Jihlava&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nIn his youth years, Kamen\u00edk featured for his local &lt;a href=\"Otrokovice\"&gt;Otrokovice&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"SK%20Ba%C5%A5ov%201930\"&gt;Ba\u0165ov 1930&lt;/a&gt; and had a two year loan in &lt;a href=\"SK%20Sigma%20Olomouc\"&gt;Sigma Olomouc&lt;/a&gt;. He spent his senior career in lower amateur tiers of &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Czech league system&lt;/a&gt;, with his peak at a &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Fourth%20Division\"&gt;then-fourth division&lt;/a&gt; side TJ FS Napajedla. He often played recreational football for amateur sides. In early 2000s, he played in lower divisions of Austrian football.\nManagerial career.\nYouth teams.\nKamen\u00edk began his managerial career with &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20Slov%C3%A1cko\"&gt;Slov\u00e1cko&lt;/a&gt;, where he spent 8 years with the youth squads. His tenure culminated by managing the U19 squad. While at Slov\u00e1cko, Kamen\u00edk attained his &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Pro%20Licence\"&gt;UEFA Pro Licence&lt;/a&gt;. Here he gained notoriety as a specialist in managing the youth squads.\nHe later relocated to serve as an authority within a regional football academy based ran by &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic\"&gt;FA\u010cR&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jihlava\"&gt;Jihlava&lt;/a&gt;. While at the academy, Kamen\u00edk was invited to coach the U19 squad at local &lt;a href=\"FC%20Vyso%C4%8Dina%20Jihlava\"&gt;Vyso\u010dina Jihlava&lt;/a&gt;. He stayed with the site for half-year.\nAssistant in Jihlava.\nWhen the former assistant manager at &lt;a href=\"FC%20Vyso%C4%8Dina%20Jihlava\"&gt;Vyso\u010dina Jihlava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michal%20Hipp\"&gt;Michal Hipp&lt;/a&gt; departed from the club, &lt;a href=\"Michal%20B%C3%ADlek\"&gt;Michal B\u00edlek&lt;/a&gt; had invited Kamen\u00edk to serve as his assistant. Kamen\u00edk became the assistant in January 2017 but the duo was relieved of their duties by April, following a series of dissatisfactory results. He returned to the U19 squad briefly, but departed the club entirely by June.\nFastav Zl\u00edn.\nAhead of the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Czech%20First%20League\"&gt;2017\u201318&lt;/a&gt; season, Kamen\u00edk became the assistant of &lt;a href=\"Bohumil%20P%C3%A1n%C3%ADk\"&gt;Bohumil P\u00e1n\u00edk&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"FC%20Fastav%20Zl%C3%ADn\"&gt;Fastav Zl\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;. With P\u00e1n\u00edk and his other assistant Jan Somberg, Kamen\u00edk co-coached Zl\u00edn in the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20group%20stage\"&gt;group stage&lt;/a&gt; of the UEFA Europa League and led them to victory at a pre-season &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovak%20Supercup\"&gt;Czechoslovak Supercup&lt;/a&gt;. P\u00e1n\u00edk was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Vlastimil%20Petr%C5%BEela\"&gt;Vlastimil Petr\u017eela&lt;/a&gt; in March 2018, after three years at the club. Kamen\u00edk continued to serve as an assistant under Petr\u017eela, who remained with the club until the end of the season and departed after few minor controversies. Zl\u00edn narrowly avoided relegation that season.\nAt the start of &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Czech%20First%20League\"&gt;2018\u201319 season&lt;/a&gt;, Kamen\u00edk had reunited with Michal B\u00edlek who was named &lt;a href=\"FC%20Fastav%20Zl%C3%ADn\"&gt;Zl\u00edn's&lt;/a&gt; new manager. The reunited duo, along with club's sporting director &lt;a href=\"Zden%C4%9Bk%20Grygera\"&gt;Zden\u011bk Grygera&lt;/a&gt;, began to pursue a play in a 3-5-2 formation. Despite initial success, the former &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Czech national team&lt;/a&gt; B\u00edlek departed the club in winter, when he was named the manager of &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;. B\u00edlek was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt; manager &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Pivarn%C3%ADk\"&gt;Roman Pivarn\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;, who kept Kamen\u00edk as his assistant. Pivarn\u00edk's side, however, recorded mere 9 points in eleven fixtures and failed to score in seven of those. Consequently, Pivarn\u00edk was let go in April and Kamen\u00edk took over as a manager of a senior team for the first time in his career, although merely on a caretaker basis, until the end of the season. Kamen\u00edk had led the team during the Europa League play-offs to determine the final participant from the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;. Fastav advanced through &lt;a href=\"SK%20Sigma%20Olomouc\"&gt;Sigma Olomouc&lt;/a&gt; in the quarter-finals by the &lt;a href=\"away%20goals%20rule\"&gt;away goals rule&lt;/a&gt; but was knocked out in the semi-finals by &lt;a href=\"FK%20Mlad%C3%A1%20Boleslav\"&gt;Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav&lt;/a&gt;, who won the ultimate spot. He concluded his brief spell with a tally of two wins and two defeats.\nAhead of the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Czech%20First%20League\"&gt;2019\u201320 season&lt;/a&gt;, Kamen\u00edk was again degraded to a role of an assistant manager, this time serving under &lt;a href=\"Josef%20Csapl%C3%A1r\"&gt;Josef Csapl\u00e1r&lt;/a&gt;. Csapl\u00e1r was too let go within half-year as, according to &lt;a href=\"Zden%C4%9Bk%20Grygera\"&gt;Grygera&lt;/a&gt;, he lacked the results, despite attracting a number of his former players. This time, however Kamen\u00edk was promoted to a role of a manager by Grygera, in hopes of having a local manager improve the results, becoming league' youngest manager. Petr Slon\u010d\u00edk was named Kamen\u00edk's assistant, after managing &lt;a href=\"FC%20TVD%20Slavi%C4%8D%C3%ADn\"&gt;TVD Slavi\u010d\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;. Kamen\u00edk's managerial spell concluded in March 2020. His spell saw three wins and three draws in league fixtures and a &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Czech%20Cup\"&gt;MOL Cup&lt;/a&gt; knock-out in Round of 16 by &lt;a href=\"FK%20Mlad%C3%A1%20Boleslav\"&gt;Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav&lt;/a&gt;. The results saw Zl\u00edn drop to a relegation zone and Kamen\u00edk was subsequently replaced by the returning &lt;a href=\"Bohumil%20P%C3%A1n%C3%ADk\"&gt;Bohumil P\u00e1n\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;.\nFC Str\u00e1n\u00ed.\nIn September 2020, Kamen\u00edk signed a contract with &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Fourth%20Division\"&gt;Fourth Division&lt;/a&gt; side . At Str\u00e1n\u00ed, he re-united with numerous players from nearby &lt;a href=\"Uhersk%C3%A9%20Hradi%C5%A1t%C4%9B\"&gt;Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20Slov%C3%A1cko\"&gt;Slov\u00e1cko&lt;/a&gt;. He led the team in five matches, with two wins and a draw.\nFK Pohronie.\nIn mid-October, Kamen\u00edk was announced as a new manager of &lt;a href=\"FK%20Pohronie\"&gt;Pohronie&lt;/a&gt;, based in &lt;a href=\"%C5%BDiar%20nad%20Hronom\"&gt;\u017diar nad Hronom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;. Pohronie avoided relegation in their novice top-division &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Slovak%20First%20Football%20League\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Mikul%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Radv%C3%A1nyi\"&gt;Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Radv\u00e1nyi&lt;/a&gt;, who kicked off the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Slovak%20First%20Football%20League\"&gt;2020\u201321 season&lt;/a&gt; as well. In early October, however, Pohronie had undergone a minor personal crisis: &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;ex-captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Pelegr%C3%ADni\"&gt;Luk\u00e1\u0161 Pelegr\u00edni&lt;/a&gt;, local striker &lt;a href=\"Patrik%20Abrah%C3%A1m\"&gt;Patrik Abrah\u00e1m&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; pre-season arrival Ryan Lindsay. After these departures, sporting director &lt;a href=\"Miroslav%20Filipko\"&gt;Miroslav Filipko&lt;/a&gt; and manager &lt;a href=\"Mikul%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Radv%C3%A1nyi\"&gt;Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Radv\u00e1nyi&lt;/a&gt; were both subsequently released from the club. Kamen\u00edk was brought in as a prospective coach with professional recommendations and marked a beginning of an internal transformation of the club.\nKamen\u00edk had his managerial debut with &lt;a href=\"FK%20Pohronie\"&gt;Pohronie&lt;/a&gt; on 17 October 2020 in a fixture against &lt;a href=\"AS%20Tren%C4%8D%C3%ADn\"&gt;AS Tren\u010d\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0tadi%C3%B3n%20pod%20Dub%C5%88om\"&gt;pod Dub\u0148om&lt;/a&gt;, in a 1\u20131 tie. Despite being one-down at half time &lt;a href=\"James%20Weir%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;James Weir&lt;/a&gt; equalised with a second-half header. Immediately in the first match, Kamen\u00edk restructured Pohronie to play in his preferred 3-5-2 &lt;a href=\"Formation%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;formation&lt;/a&gt;, dropping the previously used 4-3-3."
