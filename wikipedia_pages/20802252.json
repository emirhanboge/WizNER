    "text": "Vito John Valentinetti (September 16, 1928 \u2013 August 5, 2021) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt;. His nine-year career included one full season and parts of four others in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) with the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; (1954), &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; (1956\u201357), &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; (1957), &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Tigers\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; (1958), and &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt; (1958\u201359). \nBiography.\nValentinetti was born in &lt;a href=\"West%20New%20York%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;West New York, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. A graduate of &lt;a href=\"Iona%20College%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;Iona College&lt;/a&gt;, he entered pro baseball in 1950 in the White Sox system, and missed two seasons (1952\u201353) while serving in the military during the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;. \nValentinetti made his MLB debut with the White Sox on June 20, 1954, and that was the only game he ever pitched for the team. He surrendered six &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; on four &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt; in one &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt; in a 16\u20136 loss to the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt;. Sent back to the &lt;a href=\"minor%20league%20baseball\"&gt;minor leagues&lt;/a&gt;, he was acquired by the crosstown Cubs in the 1955 &lt;a href=\"Rule%205%20Draft\"&gt;Rule 5 Draft&lt;/a&gt;.\nValentinetti spent the entire 1956 season with the Cubs, working in 42 &lt;a href=\"games%20pitched\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;, 40 in &lt;a href=\"relief%20pitcher\"&gt;relief&lt;/a&gt;, and posting a 6\u20134 &lt;a href=\"win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29\"&gt;win\u2013loss record&lt;/a&gt;, a 3.78 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"save%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt;. The following season, however, he began to bounce around: between 1957 and 1960, he was a member of four MLB teams, five minor league clubs and seven different organizations. Although he spent part of 1958 in the minors, he pitched in 38 MLB games that season for Detroit and Washington. He made ten &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;starts&lt;/a&gt; for the Senators, and notched two &lt;a href=\"complete%20game\"&gt;complete game&lt;/a&gt;s. After only seven games in 1959, however, Valentinetti was sent back to the minors at the May cutdown, finishing his career in &lt;a href=\"Triple-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Triple-A&lt;/a&gt; in 1960. \nIn 108 MLB games, including 15 starts, and 257 innings pitched, Valentinetti allowed 266 hits and 122 walks, with 96 &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt;s, three complete games and three saves. \nFollowing baseball, Valentinetti worked in construction and in city and state government positions in New York. He died on August 5, 2021, six weeks before his 93rd birthday."
