    "text": "Sawankhalok (, ) is a district (\"&lt;a href=\"amphoe\"&gt;amphoe&lt;/a&gt;\") in the northern part of &lt;a href=\"Sukhothai%20province\"&gt;Sukhothai province&lt;/a&gt;, in the lower north of &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nNeighboring districts are (from the south clockwise) &lt;a href=\"Si%20Samrong%20district\"&gt;Si Samrong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thung%20Saliam%20district\"&gt;Thung Saliam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Si%20Satchanalai%20district\"&gt;Si Satchanalai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Si%20Nakhon%20district\"&gt;Si Nakhon&lt;/a&gt; of Sukhothai Province, &lt;a href=\"Phichai%20district\"&gt;Phichai&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Uttaradit%20province\"&gt;Uttaradit province&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phrom%20Phiram%20district\"&gt;Phrom Phiram&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Phitsanulok%20province\"&gt;Phitsanulok province&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe district was originally the capital district of Sawankhalok Province, which in 1932 was merged with Sukhothai Province. The new province was at first named Sawankhalok, but in 1939 was renamed Sukhothai and its capital district moved to &lt;a href=\"Sukhothai%20district\"&gt;Sukhothai district&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1917, the district was renamed from Mueang (\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07) to Wang Mai Khon (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19). In 1938 it was named Mueang Sawankhalok (\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e04\u0e42\u0e25\u0e01), which was changed to Sawankhalok in 1939 following the provincial renaming.\nIn the 14th\u201316th centuries the area was a center of ceramics manufacture, &lt;a href=\"Sangkhalok%20ceramic%20ware\"&gt;Sangkhalok ceramic ware&lt;/a&gt; being its best-known example.\nEconomy.\nSubdistrict \"Ban Klong Krachong\" in Sawankhalok district is the largest producer of fresh banana leaves in Thailand. More than 50% of Sukhothai's 14,215 &lt;a href=\"Rai%20%28unit%29\"&gt;rai&lt;/a&gt; of banana plantations are in Ban Klong Krachong. The banana leaf industry generated about 179 million baht for the community in 2018. Banana leaves are used for wrapping foodstuffs and crafts such as fashioning \"&lt;a href=\"Loi%20Krathong%23Overview\"&gt;krathong&lt;/a&gt;\". Sawankholok farmers grow \"kluay tani\" bananas (\"&lt;a href=\"Musa%20balbisiana\"&gt;Musa balbisiana&lt;/a&gt;\"). The fruit of this wild species of banana is not eaten as it is full of seeds. But the leaves of \"kluay tani\" (\u0e01\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e15\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35) are prized for their large size and toughness. In 2018, 40 local banana leaf farmers formed a group, \"Klum Kasettakon Plaeng Yai\", to produce biodegradable banana leaf tableware: plates and bowls initially. Although the initiative is in its early stages, the group have already received orders from Thailand and abroad.\nAdministration.\nThe district is divided into 14 sub-districts (\"&lt;a href=\"tambon\"&gt;tambon&lt;/a&gt;s\"), which are further subdivided into 143 villages (\"&lt;a href=\"muban\"&gt;muban&lt;/a&gt;s\"). &lt;a href=\"Suwankhalok\"&gt;Suwankhalok&lt;/a&gt; is a town (\"&lt;a href=\"thesaban%20mueang\"&gt;thesaban mueang&lt;/a&gt;\") and covers \"tambon\" Mueang Suwankhalok. There are a further 13 &lt;a href=\"tambon%20administrative%20organization\"&gt;tambon administrative organization&lt;/a&gt;s (TAO)."
