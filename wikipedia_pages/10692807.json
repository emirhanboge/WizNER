    "text": "A circumscribed halo is a type of &lt;a href=\"Halo%20%28optical%20phenomenon%29\"&gt;halo&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"optical%20phenomenon\"&gt;optical phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; typically in the form of a more or less oval ring that &lt;a href=\"circumscribe\"&gt;circumscribe&lt;/a&gt;s the circular &lt;a href=\"22%C2%B0%20halo\"&gt;22\u00b0 halo&lt;/a&gt; centred on the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs the sun rises above 70\u00b0 it essentially covers the 22\u00b0 halo. Like many other halos, it is slightly reddish on the inner edge, facing the sun or moon, and bluish on the outer edge.\nThe shape of the circumscribed halo is strongly dependent on the distance of the sun or moon above the horizon. Its top and bottom (i.e., the points directly below and above the sun or moon) always lie directly &lt;a href=\"tangent\"&gt;tangent&lt;/a&gt;ial to the 22\u00b0 halo, but its left and right sides take on different shapes depending on solar (or lunar) elevation. At an elevation between about 35\u00b0\u201350\u00b0, the sides form two distinct, downward-drooping \"lobes\" outside of the 22\u00b0 halo. As the sun or moon rises higher (between c. 50\u00b0\u201370\u00b0), the drooping diminishes towards a more regular oval shape. At an elevation of c. 70\u00b0 or more, the shape of the circumscribed halo approaches a circle, and as such becomes nearly indistinguishable from the 22\u00b0 halo, only to be identified by its tendency to show more saturated colors than the latter. When the sun or moon is at an elevation lower than c. 35\u00b0, the circumscribed halo breaks up into the &lt;a href=\"upper%20tangent%20arc\"&gt;upper tangent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lower%20tangent%20arc\"&gt;lower tangent arc&lt;/a&gt;s."
