    "text": "The Hundred Years\u2019 War (; 1337\u20131453) was a series of armed conflicts between the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Late Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. It originated from disputed claims to the &lt;a href=\"French%20Crown\"&gt;French throne&lt;/a&gt; between the English &lt;a href=\"Dynasty\"&gt;royal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plantagenet\"&gt;House of Plantagenet&lt;/a&gt; and the French royal &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Valois\"&gt;House of Valois&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the war grew into a broader power struggle involving factions from across &lt;a href=\"Western%20Europe\"&gt;Western Europe&lt;/a&gt;, fueled by emerging &lt;a href=\"nationalism\"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt; on both sides.\nThe Hundred Years\u2019 War was one of the most notable conflicts of the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. For 116 years, interrupted by several &lt;a href=\"Ceasefire\"&gt;truces&lt;/a&gt;, five generations of kings from two rival &lt;a href=\"Dynasty\"&gt;dynasties&lt;/a&gt; fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in Western Europe. The war\u2019s effect on European history was lasting. Both sides produced innovations in military technology, and tactics, such as professional standing armies and artillery, that permanently changed warfare in Europe; &lt;a href=\"chivalry\"&gt;chivalry&lt;/a&gt;, which had reached its height during the conflict, subsequently declined. Stronger &lt;a href=\"National%20identity\"&gt;national identities&lt;/a&gt; took root in both countries, which became more centralised and gradually rose as global powers.\nThe term \"Hundred Years\u2019 War\" was adopted by later historians as a &lt;a href=\"Historiography\"&gt;historiographical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"periodisation\"&gt;periodisation&lt;/a&gt; to encompass related conflicts, constructing the longest military conflict in &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Europe\"&gt;European history&lt;/a&gt;. The war is commonly divided into three phases separated by &lt;a href=\"Ceasefire\"&gt;truces&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War%20%281337%E2%80%931360%29\"&gt;Edwardian War&lt;/a&gt; (1337\u20131360), the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War%20%281369%E2%80%931389%29\"&gt;Caroline War&lt;/a&gt; (1369\u20131389), and the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War%20%281415%E2%80%931453%29\"&gt;Lancastrian War&lt;/a&gt; (1415\u20131453). Each side drew many &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; into the conflict, with English forces initially prevailing; the House of Valois ultimately retained control over France, with the previously-intertwined French and English monarchies thereafter remaining separate.\nOverview.\nOrigins.\nThe root causes of the conflict can be traced to the &lt;a href=\"Crisis%20of%20the%20Late%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;crisis of 14th-century Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory; the official pretext was the question that arose because of the interruption of the direct male line of the &lt;a href=\"Capetian%20dynasty\"&gt;Capetian dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French (&lt;a href=\"Normans\"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt;, and later, &lt;a href=\"Angevin%20kings%20of%20England\"&gt;Angevin&lt;/a&gt;) in origin. English monarchs had therefore historically held &lt;a href=\"Angevin%20Empire\"&gt;titles and lands within France&lt;/a&gt;, which made them &lt;a href=\"vassal\"&gt;vassal&lt;/a&gt;s to the kings of France. The status of the English king\u2019s French &lt;a href=\"fief\"&gt;fief&lt;/a&gt;s was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Auld%20Alliance\"&gt;ally of France&lt;/a&gt;. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20lands%20of%20France\"&gt;French royal domain&lt;/a&gt;; by 1337, however, only &lt;a href=\"Gascony\"&gt;Gascony&lt;/a&gt; was English.\nIn 1328, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20IV%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles IV of France&lt;/a&gt; died without sons or brothers and &lt;a href=\"Salic%20Law%23The%20succession%20in%201316\"&gt;a new principle&lt;/a&gt;, Salic law, disallowed female succession. Charles\u2019s closest male relative was his nephew &lt;a href=\"Edward%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward III of England&lt;/a&gt;, whose mother, &lt;a href=\"Isabella%20of%20France\"&gt;Isabella&lt;/a&gt;, was Charles\u2019s sister. Isabella &lt;a href=\"English%20claims%20to%20the%20French%20throne\"&gt;claimed the throne of France for her son&lt;/a&gt; by the rule of &lt;a href=\"Proximity%20of%20blood\"&gt;Proximity of blood&lt;/a&gt;, but the French nobility rejected this, maintaining that Isabella &lt;a href=\"Nemo%20dat%20quod%20non%20habet\"&gt;could not transmit a right she did not possess&lt;/a&gt;. An assembly of French &lt;a href=\"barons\"&gt;barons&lt;/a&gt; decided that a &lt;a href=\"French%20people\"&gt;native Frenchman&lt;/a&gt; should receive the crown, rather than Edward.\nSo the throne passed instead to Charles\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Patrilineality\"&gt;patrilineal&lt;/a&gt; cousin, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20VI%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Counts%20and%20dukes%20of%20Valois\"&gt;Count of Valois&lt;/a&gt;. Edward protested but ultimately submitted and did homage for Gascony. Further French disagreements with Edward induced Philip, during May 1337, to meet with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that Gascony should be taken back into Philip\u2019s hands, which prompted Edward to renew his claim for the French throne, this time by force of arms.\nEdwardian Phase.\nIn the early years of the war, the English, led by their king and his son &lt;a href=\"Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince\"&gt;Edward, the Black Prince&lt;/a&gt;, saw resounding successes (notably at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy\"&gt;Cr\u00e9cy&lt;/a&gt; in 1346 and at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Poitiers\"&gt;Poitiers&lt;/a&gt; in 1356 where King &lt;a href=\"John%20II%20of%20France\"&gt;John II of France&lt;/a&gt; was taken prisoner).\nCaroline Phase and Black Death.\nBy 1378, under King &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt; the Wise and the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Bertrand%20du%20Guesclin\"&gt;Bertrand du Guesclin&lt;/a&gt;, the French had reconquered most of the lands ceded to King Edward in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Br%C3%A9tigny\"&gt;Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny&lt;/a&gt; (signed in 1360), leaving the English with only a few cities on the continent.\nIn the following decades, the weakening of royal authority, combined with the devastation caused by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Death\"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt; of 1347\u20131351 (with the loss of nearly half of the French population and between 20% and 33% of the English one) and the major economic crisis that followed, led to a period of civil unrest in both countries. These crises were resolved in England earlier than in France.\nLancastrian Phase and after.\nThe newly crowned &lt;a href=\"Henry%20V%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry V of England&lt;/a&gt; seized the opportunity presented by the mental illness of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VI%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles VI of France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Armagnac%E2%80%93Burgundian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;French civil war between Armagnacs and Burgundians&lt;/a&gt; to revive the conflict. Overwhelming victories at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Agincourt\"&gt;Agincourt&lt;/a&gt; in 1415 and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Verneuil\"&gt;Verneuil&lt;/a&gt; in 1424 as well as an alliance with the Burgundians raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph and persuaded the English to continue the war over many decades. However, a variety of factors such as the deaths of both Henry and Charles in 1422, the emergence of &lt;a href=\"Joan%20of%20Arc\"&gt;Joan of Arc&lt;/a&gt; which boosted French morale, and the loss of &lt;a href=\"Burgundian%20State\"&gt;Burgundy&lt;/a&gt; as an ally, marking the end of the civil war in France, prevented it.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans\"&gt;Siege of Orl\u00e9ans&lt;/a&gt; in 1429 announced the beginning of the end for English hopes of conquest. Even with the eventual capture of Joan by the Burgundians and her execution in 1431, a series of crushing French victories such as those at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Patay\"&gt;Patay&lt;/a&gt; in 1429, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Formigny\"&gt;Formigny&lt;/a&gt; in 1450 and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Castillon\"&gt;Castillon&lt;/a&gt; in 1453 concluded the war in favour of the Valois dynasty. England permanently lost most of its continental possessions, with only the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20of%20Calais\"&gt;Pale of Calais&lt;/a&gt; remaining under its control on the continent, until it too was lost in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281558%29\"&gt;Siege of Calais&lt;/a&gt; in 1558.\nRelated conflicts and aftereffects.\nLocal conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Breton%20Succession\"&gt;War of the Breton Succession&lt;/a&gt; (1341\u20131365), the &lt;a href=\"Castilian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Castilian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; (1366\u20131369), the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Two%20Peters\"&gt;War of the Two Peters&lt;/a&gt; (1356\u20131369) in &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;Aragon&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"1383%E2%80%9385%20crisis\"&gt;1383\u201385 crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, were used by the parties to advance their agendas.\nBy the War\u2019s end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20succession\"&gt;dynastic conflict&lt;/a&gt;, the war inspired &lt;a href=\"French%20nationalism\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"English%20nationalism%23Medieval\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nationalism\"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt;. The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the &lt;a href=\"feudalism\"&gt;feudal&lt;/a&gt; armies where &lt;a href=\"heavy%20cavalry\"&gt;heavy cavalry&lt;/a&gt; had dominated, and &lt;a href=\"artillery\"&gt;artillery&lt;/a&gt; became important. The war precipitated the creation of the first &lt;a href=\"standing%20army\"&gt;standing armies&lt;/a&gt; in Western Europe since the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Western Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and helped change their &lt;a href=\"Military%20science\"&gt;role in warfare&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn France, &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;s, deadly &lt;a href=\"epidemic\"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"famine\"&gt;famine&lt;/a&gt;s, and bandit &lt;a href=\"Free%20company\"&gt;free-companies&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Routiers\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; reduced the population drastically. In England, political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20British%20peerage\"&gt;English nobles&lt;/a&gt;, resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, as well as the general shock at losing a war in which investment had been so great, helped lead to the &lt;a href=\"Wars%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;Wars of the Roses&lt;/a&gt; (1455\u20131487).\nCauses and prelude.\nDynastic turmoil in France: 1316\u20131328.\nThe question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20X%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis X&lt;/a&gt; in 1316. Louis X left only &lt;a href=\"Joan%20II%20of%20Navarre\"&gt;one daughter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"John%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;John I of France&lt;/a&gt;, who only lived for five days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the &lt;a href=\"Tour%20de%20Nesle%20affair\"&gt;Tour de Nesle affair&lt;/a&gt;. Philip, &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Poitiers\"&gt;Count of Poitiers&lt;/a&gt;, brother of Louis X, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that women should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as &lt;a href=\"Philip%20V%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip V&lt;/a&gt;. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20IV%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles IV&lt;/a&gt;, in 1322.\nCharles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. A girl, &lt;a href=\"Blanche%20of%20France%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans\"&gt;Blanche of France&lt;/a&gt; (later Duchess of Orleans), was born, therefore rendering the main male line of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Capet\"&gt;House of Capet&lt;/a&gt; extinct.\nBy &lt;a href=\"proximity%20of%20blood\"&gt;proximity of blood&lt;/a&gt;, the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward III of England&lt;/a&gt;. Edward was the son of &lt;a href=\"Isabella%20of%20France\"&gt;Isabella&lt;/a&gt;, the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, baulked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabella and her lover &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Mortimer%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20March\"&gt;Roger Mortimer&lt;/a&gt;, who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward II&lt;/a&gt;. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Paris\"&gt;University of Paris&lt;/a&gt; decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest &lt;a href=\"Agnatic%20primogeniture\"&gt;heir through male ancestry&lt;/a&gt; was Charles IV\u2019s first cousin, Philip, &lt;a href=\"Counts%20and%20dukes%20of%20Valois\"&gt;Count of Valois&lt;/a&gt;, and it was decided that he should be crowned &lt;a href=\"Philip%20VI%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip VI&lt;/a&gt;. In 1340 the &lt;a href=\"Avignon%20papacy\"&gt;Avignon papacy&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that under &lt;a href=\"Salic%20law\"&gt;Salic law&lt;/a&gt; males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.\nEventually, Edward III reluctantly recognised Philip VI and paid him &lt;a href=\"Homage%20%28feudal%29\"&gt;homage&lt;/a&gt; for his French fiefs in 1325. He made concessions in &lt;a href=\"Guyenne\"&gt;Guyenne&lt;/a&gt;, but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made &lt;a href=\"Second%20War%20of%20Scottish%20Independence\"&gt;war on Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dispute over Guyenne: a problem of sovereignty.\nTensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 &lt;a href=\"Norman%20conquest%20of%20England\"&gt;Norman conquest of England&lt;/a&gt;, in which the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20England\"&gt;English throne&lt;/a&gt; was seized by the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Normandy\"&gt;Duke of Normandy&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"vassal\"&gt;vassal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20French%20monarchs\"&gt;King of France&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French King, as they could now draw upon the economic power of &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20English%20monarchs\"&gt;English monarchs&lt;/a&gt; would struggle to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies throughout the medieval era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Normans\"&gt;Anglo-Norman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Normandy\"&gt;dynasty&lt;/a&gt; that had ruled &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20Plantagenet%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Geoffrey of Anjou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Matilda\"&gt;Empress Matilda&lt;/a&gt;, and great-grandson of &lt;a href=\"William%20the%20Conqueror\"&gt;William the Conqueror&lt;/a&gt;, became the first of the &lt;a href=\"Angevin%20kings%20of%20England\"&gt;Angevin kings of England&lt;/a&gt; in 1154 as Henry II. The Angevin kings ruled over what was later known as the &lt;a href=\"Angevin%20Empire\"&gt;Angevin Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which included more French territory than that under the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20French%20monarchs\"&gt;kings of France&lt;/a&gt;. The Angevins still owed &lt;a href=\"Homage%20%28feudal%29\"&gt;homage&lt;/a&gt; for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, neutralising the issue.\n&lt;a href=\"John%2C%20King%20of%20England\"&gt;King John of England&lt;/a&gt; inherited the Angevin domains from his brother &lt;a href=\"Richard%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Richard I&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip II of France&lt;/a&gt; acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and &lt;a href=\"French%20invasion%20of%20Normandy%20%281202%E2%80%931204%29\"&gt;by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions&lt;/a&gt;. Following John\u2019s reign, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bouvines\"&gt;Battle of Bouvines&lt;/a&gt; (1214), the &lt;a href=\"Saintonge%20War\"&gt;Saintonge War&lt;/a&gt; (1242), and finally the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Saint-Sardos\"&gt;War of Saint-Sardos&lt;/a&gt; (1324), the English king\u2019s holdings on the continent, as &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Aquitaine\"&gt;Duke of Aquitaine&lt;/a&gt;, were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony.\nThe dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognise the &lt;a href=\"suzerainty\"&gt;suzerainty&lt;/a&gt; of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.\nDuring the War of Saint-Sardos, &lt;a href=\"Charles%2C%20Count%20of%20Valois\"&gt;Charles of Valois&lt;/a&gt;, father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward II of England&lt;/a&gt;. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.\nThe King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus &lt;a href=\"Agenais\"&gt;Agen&lt;/a&gt; but the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.\nGascony under the King of England.\nIn the 11th century, &lt;a href=\"Gascony\"&gt;Gascony&lt;/a&gt; in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as \"Guyenne\" or \"Guienne\") and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: \"Guyenne-et-Gascogne\"). The &lt;a href=\"Angevin%20kings%20of%20England\"&gt;Angevin kings of England&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20of%20Aquitaine\"&gt;Dukes of Aquitaine&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry II&lt;/a&gt; married the former Queen of France, &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine\"&gt;Eleanor of Aquitaine&lt;/a&gt;, in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French Crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.\nAt the beginning of Edward III\u2019s reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin (&lt;a href=\"Plantagenet\"&gt;Plantagenet&lt;/a&gt;) Kings of England in southwest France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.\nFor the first 10 years of Edward III\u2019s reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French &lt;a href=\"suzerainty\"&gt;suzerainty&lt;/a&gt;. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed, with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword. Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration.\nGascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward\u2019s influential advisers was &lt;a href=\"Robert%20III%20of%20Artois\"&gt;Robert III of Artois&lt;/a&gt;. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.\nFranco-Scot alliance.\nFrance was an ally of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Kingdom of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the area. In 1295, &lt;a href=\"Auld%20Alliance\"&gt;a treaty&lt;/a&gt; was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Philip%20IV%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip the Fair&lt;/a&gt; known as the Auld Alliance. Charles IV formally &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Corbeil%20%281326%29\"&gt;renewed the treaty&lt;/a&gt; in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland\u2019s support if its own kingdom were attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.\nPhilip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a &lt;a href=\"crusade\"&gt;crusade&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Land\"&gt;Holy Land&lt;/a&gt;. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish navy, moved to the &lt;a href=\"English%20Channel\"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt; off Normandy in 1336, threatening England. To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots \"at a suitable time\", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.\nBeginning of the war: 1337\u20131360.\nEnd of homage.\nAt the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The \"&lt;a href=\"arri%C3%A8re-ban\"&gt;arri\u00e8re-ban&lt;/a&gt;\", literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king\u2019s hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king\u2019s 'mortal enemy' &lt;a href=\"Robert%20III%20of%20Artois\"&gt;Robert d'Artois&lt;/a&gt;. Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip\u2019s right to the French throne.\nWhen Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV\u2019s sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward\u2019s homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.\nOn 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Flanders\"&gt;Count of Flanders&lt;/a&gt;. The civic authorities of &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ypres\"&gt;Ypres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bruges\"&gt;Bruges&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward\u2019s purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the &lt;a href=\"Low%20Countries\"&gt;Low Countries&lt;/a&gt;. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the \"true\" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.\nRelations with Flanders were also tied to the &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20English%20wool%20trade\"&gt;English wool trade&lt;/a&gt;, since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Chancellor\"&gt;chancellor&lt;/a&gt; sit on the &lt;a href=\"woolsack\"&gt;woolsack&lt;/a&gt; in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade. At the time there were about 110,000 &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Sussex%23Wool\"&gt;sheep in Sussex&lt;/a&gt; alone. The great medieval English monasteries produced large surpluses of wool that were sold to mainland Europe. Successive governments were able to make large amounts of money by taxing it. France\u2019s sea power led to economic disruptions for England, shrinking the wool trade to &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; and the wine trade from Gascony.\nOutbreak, the English Channel and Brittany.\nOn 22 June 1340, Edward and his fleet sailed from England and the next day arrived off the &lt;a href=\"Zwin\"&gt;Zwin&lt;/a&gt; estuary. The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of &lt;a href=\"Sluis\"&gt;Sluis&lt;/a&gt;. The English fleet deceived the French into believing they were withdrawing. When the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sluys\"&gt;Battle of Sluys&lt;/a&gt;.\nEngland dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French &lt;a href=\"invasions\"&gt;invasions&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, Edward\u2019s funds ran out and the war probably would have ended were it not for the death of the &lt;a href=\"John%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Duke of Brittany&lt;/a&gt; in 1341 precipitating a succession dispute between the duke\u2019s half-brother &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Montfort\"&gt;John of Montfort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Charles of Blois&lt;/a&gt;, nephew of Philip VI.\nIn 1341, conflict over the succession to the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Duchy of Brittany&lt;/a&gt; began the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Breton%20Succession\"&gt;War of the Breton Succession&lt;/a&gt;, in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois. Action for the next few years focused around a back-and-forth struggle in Brittany. The city of &lt;a href=\"Vannes\"&gt;Vannes&lt;/a&gt; in Brittany changed hands several times, while further campaigns in Gascony met with mixed success for both sides. The English-backed Montfort finally succeeded in taking the duchy but not until 1364.\nBattle of Cr\u00e9cy and the taking of Calais.\nIn July 1346, Edward mounted a major invasion across the channel, landing in Normandy\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Cotentin\"&gt;Cotentin&lt;/a&gt;, at St. Vaast. The English army &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Caen%20%281346%29\"&gt;captured&lt;/a&gt; the city of &lt;a href=\"Caen\"&gt;Caen&lt;/a&gt; in just one day, surprising the French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed. He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip\u2019s army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip\u2019s army attacked.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy\"&gt;Battle of Cr\u00e9cy&lt;/a&gt; of 1346 was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the &lt;a href=\"English%20longbow\"&gt;longbowmen&lt;/a&gt; and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready. Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King &lt;a href=\"David%20II%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;David II of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Neville%27s%20Cross\"&gt;Battle of Neville's Cross&lt;/a&gt;, on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland.\nIn France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281346%E2%80%931347%29\"&gt;besieged the city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Calais\"&gt;Calais&lt;/a&gt; on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347. This became an important strategic asset for the English, allowing them to keep troops safely in northern France. Calais would remain under English control, even after the end of the Hundred Years' War, until the successful &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281558%29\"&gt;French siege in 1558&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Poitiers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Black%20Death\"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt;, which had just arrived in Paris in 1348, began to ravage Europe. In 1355, after the plague had passed and England was able to recover financially, King Edward\u2019s son and namesake, the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt;, later known as the &lt;a href=\"Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince\"&gt;Black Prince&lt;/a&gt;, led a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Prince%27s%20chevauch%C3%A9e%20of%201355\"&gt;Chevauch\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; from Gascony into France, during which he pillaged &lt;a href=\"Avignonet\"&gt;Avignonet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Castelnaudary\"&gt;Castelnaudary&lt;/a&gt;, sacked &lt;a href=\"Carcassonne\"&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt;, and plundered &lt;a href=\"Narbonne\"&gt;Narbonne&lt;/a&gt;. The next year during &lt;a href=\"Black%20Prince%27s%20chevauch%C3%A9e%20of%201356\"&gt;another Chevauch\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; he ravaged &lt;a href=\"Auvergne\"&gt;Auvergne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Limousin\"&gt;Limousin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Berry%2C%20France\"&gt;Berry&lt;/a&gt; but failed to take &lt;a href=\"Bourges\"&gt;Bourges&lt;/a&gt;. He offered terms of peace to King &lt;a href=\"John%20II%20of%20France\"&gt;John II of France&lt;/a&gt; (known as John the Good), who had outflanked him near Poitiers, but refused to surrender himself as the price of their acceptance.\nThis led to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Poitiers\"&gt;Battle of Poitiers&lt;/a&gt; (19 September 1356) where the Black Prince\u2019s army routed the French. During the battle, the Gascon noble &lt;a href=\"Jean%20III%20de%20Grailly%2C%20captal%20de%20Buch\"&gt;Jean de Grailly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"captal%20de%20Buch\"&gt;captal de Buch&lt;/a&gt; led a mounted unit that was concealed in a forest. The French advance was contained, at which point de Grailly led a flanking movement with his horsemen cutting off the French retreat and succeeding in capturing King John and many of his nobles. With John held hostage, his son the &lt;a href=\"Dauphin%20of%20France\"&gt;Dauphin&lt;/a&gt; (later to become &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt;) assumed the powers of the king as &lt;a href=\"Regency%20%28government%29\"&gt;regent&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Battle of Poitiers, many French nobles and mercenaries rampaged, and chaos ruled. A contemporary report recounted:\n... all went ill with the kingdom and the State was undone. Thieves and robbers rose up everywhere in the land. The Nobles despised and hated all others and took no thought for usefulness and profit of lord and men. They subjected and despoiled the peasants and the men of the villages. In no wise did they defend their country from its enemies; rather did they trample it underfoot, robbing and pillaging the peasants' goods\u00a0...\nReims Campaign and Black Monday.\nEdward invaded France, for the third and last time, hoping to capitalise on the discontent and seize the throne. The Dauphin\u2019s strategy was that of non-engagement with the English army in the field. However, Edward wanted the crown and chose the cathedral city of &lt;a href=\"Reims\"&gt;Reims&lt;/a&gt; for his coronation (Reims was the traditional coronation city). However, the citizens of Reims built and reinforced the city\u2019s defences before Edward and his army arrived. Edward besieged the city for five weeks, but the defences held and there was no coronation. Edward moved on to Paris, but retreated after a few skirmishes in the suburbs. Next was the town of &lt;a href=\"Chartres\"&gt;Chartres&lt;/a&gt;.\nDisaster struck in a freak &lt;a href=\"hailstorm\"&gt;hailstorm&lt;/a&gt; on the encamped army, causing over 1,000 English deaths \u2013 the so-called &lt;a href=\"Black%20Monday%20%281360%29\"&gt;Black Monday&lt;/a&gt; at Easter 1360. This devastated Edward\u2019s army and forced him to negotiate when approached by the French. A conference was held at Br\u00e9tigny that resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Br%C3%A9tigny\"&gt;Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny&lt;/a&gt; (8 May 1360). The treaty was ratified at Calais in October. In return for increased lands in Aquitaine, Edward renounced Normandy, Touraine, Anjou and Maine and consented to reduce King John\u2019s ransom by a million crowns. Edward also abandoned his claim to the crown of France.\nFirst peace: 1360\u20131369.\nThe French king, John II, had been held captive in England. The Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny set his ransom at 3\u00a0million\u00a0crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John\u2019s son &lt;a href=\"Louis%20I%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Louis of Anjou&lt;/a&gt;, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honour-bound to return to captivity in England.\nThe French crown had been at odds with &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Navarre\"&gt;Navarre&lt;/a&gt; (near southern Gascony) since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power. Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations. In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity. Charles V succeeded him as king of France. On 16 May, one month after the dauphin\u2019s accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cocherel\"&gt;Battle of Cocherel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrench ascendancy under Charles V: 1369\u20131389.\nAquitaine and Castile.\nIn 1366 there was a civil war of succession in &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Castile%23Ascension%20of%20the%20Trast%C3%A1mara%20dynasty\"&gt;Castile&lt;/a&gt; (part of modern Spain). The forces of the ruler &lt;a href=\"Peter%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Peter of Castile&lt;/a&gt; were pitched against those of his half-brother &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Henry of Trast\u00e1mara&lt;/a&gt;. The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by &lt;a href=\"Bertrand%20du%20Guesclin\"&gt;Bertrand du Guesclin&lt;/a&gt;, a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France\u2019s war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trast\u00e1mara in his invasion of Castile.\nPeter appealed to England and Aquitaine\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Black%20Prince\"&gt;Black Prince&lt;/a&gt; for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter\u2019s claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castile. Peter was restored to power after Trast\u00e1mara\u2019s army was defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20N%C3%A1jera\"&gt;Battle of N\u00e1jera&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castile campaign, the prince instituted a &lt;a href=\"hearth%20tax\"&gt;hearth tax&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Arnaud%20Amanieu%2C%20Lord%20of%20Albret\"&gt;Arnaud-Amanieu VIII&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of &lt;a href=\"Albret\"&gt;Albret&lt;/a&gt; had fought on the Black Prince\u2019s side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his High Court in Paris. The Black Prince answered that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again and Edward III resumed the title of King of France. Charles V declared that all the English possessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all of Aquitaine was in full revolt.\nWith the Black Prince gone from Castile, Henry of Trast\u00e1mara led a second invasion that ended with Peter\u2019s death at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Montiel\"&gt;Battle of Montiel&lt;/a&gt; in March 1369. The new Castilian regime provided naval support to French campaigns against Aquitaine and England. In 1372 the Castilian fleet defeated the English fleet in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20La%20Rochelle\"&gt;Battle of La Rochelle&lt;/a&gt;.\n1373 campaign of John of Gaunt.\nIn August 1373, &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Gaunt\"&gt;John of Gaunt&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"John%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;John de Montfort&lt;/a&gt;, Duke of Brittany led a force of 9,000 men from Calais on a . While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose them, the English met more resistance as they moved south. French forces began to concentrate around the English force but under orders from &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt;, the French avoided a set battle. Instead, they fell on forces detached from the main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves trapped against the &lt;a href=\"Allier%20%28river%29\"&gt;River Allier&lt;/a&gt; by four French forces. With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at &lt;a href=\"Moulins%2C%20Allier\"&gt;Moulins&lt;/a&gt; but lost all their baggage and loot. The English carried on south across the &lt;a href=\"Limousin\"&gt;Limousin&lt;/a&gt; plateau but the weather was turning severe. Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded their armour. At the beginning of December, the English army entered friendly territory in &lt;a href=\"Gascony\"&gt;Gascony&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of December they were in &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;, starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of the 30,000 horses with which they had left Calais. Although the march across France had been a remarkable feat, it was a military failure.\nEnglish turmoil.\nWith his health deteriorating, the Black Prince returned to England in January 1371, where his father Edward III was elderly and also in poor health. The prince\u2019s illness was debilitating, and he died on 8 June 1376. Edward III died the following year on 21 June 1377 and was succeeded by the Black Prince\u2019s second son &lt;a href=\"Richard%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Richard II&lt;/a&gt; who was still a child of 10 (&lt;a href=\"Edward%20of%20Angoul%C3%AAme\"&gt;Edward of Angoul\u00eame&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Prince\u2019s first son, had died sometime earlier). The treaty of Br\u00e9tigny had left Edward III and England with enlarged holdings in France, but a small professional French army under the leadership of du Guesclin pushed the English back; by the time Charles V died in 1380, the English held only Calais and a few other ports.\nIt was usual to appoint a &lt;a href=\"regent\"&gt;regent&lt;/a&gt; in the case of a child monarch but no regent was appointed for Richard II, who nominally exercised the power of kingship from the date of his accession in 1377. Between 1377 and 1380, actual power was in the hands of a series of councils. The political community preferred this to a regency led by the king\u2019s uncle, &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Gaunt%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;John of Gaunt&lt;/a&gt;, although Gaunt remained highly influential. Richard faced many challenges during his reign, including the &lt;a href=\"Peasants%27%20Revolt\"&gt;Peasants' Revolt&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Wat%20Tyler\"&gt;Wat Tyler&lt;/a&gt; in 1381 and an Anglo-Scottish war in 1384\u20131385. His attempts to raise taxes to pay for his Scottish adventure and for the protection of Calais against the French made him increasingly unpopular.\n1380 campaign of the Earl of Buckingham.\nIn July 1380, the &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20of%20Woodstock%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester\"&gt;Earl of Buckingham&lt;/a&gt; commanded an expedition to France to aid England\u2019s ally, the &lt;a href=\"John%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Duke of Brittany&lt;/a&gt;. The French refused battle before the walls of &lt;a href=\"Troyes\"&gt;Troyes&lt;/a&gt; on 25 August; Buckingham\u2019s forces continued their and in November laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt;. The support expected from the Duke of Brittany did not appear and in the face of severe losses in men and horses, Buckingham was forced to abandon the siege in January 1381. In February, reconciled to the regime of the new French king &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VI%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles VI&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Gu%C3%A9rande%20%281381%29\"&gt;Treaty of Gu\u00e9rande&lt;/a&gt;, Brittany paid 50,000 francs to Buckingham for him to abandon the siege and the campaign.\nFrench turmoil.\nAfter the deaths of Charles V and du Guesclin in 1380, France lost its main leadership and overall momentum in the war. &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VI%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles VI&lt;/a&gt; succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority.\nWith France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the &lt;a href=\"Harelle\"&gt;Harelle&lt;/a&gt; and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace.\nPhilip II of Burgundy, the uncle of the French king, brought together a Burgundian-French army and a fleet of 1,200 ships near the Zeeland town of &lt;a href=\"Sluis\"&gt;Sluis&lt;/a&gt; in the summer and autumn of 1386 to attempt an invasion of England, but this venture failed. However, Philip\u2019s brother &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Berry\"&gt;John of Berry&lt;/a&gt; appeared deliberately late, so that the autumn weather prevented the fleet from leaving and the invading army then dispersed again.\nDifficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war\u2019s pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through &lt;a href=\"proxy%20war\"&gt;proxy war&lt;/a&gt;s, such as during the &lt;a href=\"1383%E2%80%931385%20Portuguese%20interregnum\"&gt;1383\u20131385 Portuguese interregnum&lt;/a&gt;. The independence party in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Kingdom of Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile\u2019s claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.\nSecond peace: 1389\u20131415.\nThe war became increasingly unpopular with the English public due to the high taxes needed for the war effort. These taxes were seen as one of the reasons for the Peasants' Revolt. Richard II\u2019s indifference to the war together with his preferential treatment of a select few close friends and advisors angered an alliance of lords that included &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20of%20Woodstock%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester\"&gt;one of his uncles&lt;/a&gt;. This group, known as &lt;a href=\"Lords%20Appellant\"&gt;Lords Appellant&lt;/a&gt;, managed to press charges of treason against five of Richard\u2019s advisors and friends in the &lt;a href=\"Merciless%20Parliament\"&gt;Merciless Parliament&lt;/a&gt;. The Lords Appellant were able to gain control of the council in 1388 but failed to reignite the war in France. Although the will was there, the funds to pay the troops was lacking, so in the autumn of 1388 the Council agreed to resume negotiations with the French crown, beginning on 18 June 1389 with the signing of the three-year &lt;a href=\"Truce%20of%20Leulinghem\"&gt;Truce of Leulinghem&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1389, Richard\u2019s uncle and supporter, &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Gaunt\"&gt;John of Gaunt&lt;/a&gt;, returned from Spain and Richard was able to rebuild his power gradually until 1397, when he reasserted his authority and destroyed the principal three among the Lords Appellant. In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, Richard II disinherited Gaunt\u2019s son, the exiled &lt;a href=\"Henry%20IV%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry of Bolingbroke&lt;/a&gt;. Bolingbroke returned to England with his supporters, deposed Richard and had himself crowned Henry IV. In Scotland, the problems brought in by the English regime change prompted border raids that were countered by an invasion in 1402 and the defeat of a Scottish army at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Humbleton%20Hill\"&gt;Battle of Homildon Hill&lt;/a&gt;. A dispute over the spoils between Henry and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Percy%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland\"&gt;Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland&lt;/a&gt;, resulted in a long and bloody struggle between the two for control of northern England, resolved only with the almost complete destruction of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Percy\"&gt;House of Percy&lt;/a&gt; by 1408.\nIn Wales, &lt;a href=\"Owain%20Glynd%C5%B5r\"&gt;Owain Glynd\u0175r&lt;/a&gt; was declared &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt; on 16 September 1400. He was the leader of the most serious and widespread &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Anglo-Welsh%20wars\"&gt;rebellion against England&lt;/a&gt; authority in Wales since the &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20of%20Wales%20by%20Edward%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;conquest of 1282\u20131283&lt;/a&gt;. In 1405, the French allied with Glynd\u0175r and the Castilians in Spain; a Franco-Welsh army advanced as far as &lt;a href=\"Worcester%2C%20England\"&gt;Worcester&lt;/a&gt;, while the Spaniards used galleys to raid and burn all the way from &lt;a href=\"Cornwall\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Southampton\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt;, before taking refuge in &lt;a href=\"Harfleur\"&gt;Harfleur&lt;/a&gt; for the winter. The &lt;a href=\"Glynd%C5%B5r%20Rising\"&gt;Glynd\u0175r Rising&lt;/a&gt; was finally put down in 1415 and resulted in Welsh semi-independence for a number of years.\nIn 1392, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VI%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles VI&lt;/a&gt; suddenly descended into madness, forcing France into a regency dominated by his uncles and his brother. A conflict for control over the Regency began between his uncle &lt;a href=\"Philip%20the%20Bold\"&gt;Philip the Bold&lt;/a&gt;, Duke of Burgundy and his brother, &lt;a href=\"Louis%20of%20Valois%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans\"&gt;Louis of Valois, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans&lt;/a&gt;. After Philip\u2019s death, his son and heir &lt;a href=\"John%20the%20Fearless\"&gt;John the Fearless&lt;/a&gt; continued the struggle against Louis but with the disadvantage of having no close relation to the king. Finding himself outmanoeuvred politically, John ordered the assassination of Louis in retaliation. His involvement in the murder was quickly revealed and the &lt;a href=\"Armagnac%20%28party%29\"&gt;Armagnac&lt;/a&gt; family took political power in opposition to John. By 1410, both sides were bidding for the help of English forces in a civil war. In 1418 Paris was taken by the Burgundians, who were unable to stop the massacre of &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20VII%2C%20Count%20of%20Armagnac\"&gt;Count of Armagnac&lt;/a&gt; and his followers by a Parisian crowd, with an estimated death toll between 1,000 and 5,000.\nThroughout this period, England confronted repeated raids by &lt;a href=\"pirates\"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt; that damaged trade and the navy. There is some evidence that Henry IV used state-legalised piracy as a form of warfare in the English Channel. He used such &lt;a href=\"privateer\"&gt;privateer&lt;/a&gt;ing campaigns to pressure enemies without risking open war. The French responded in kind and French pirates, under Scottish protection, raided many English coastal towns. The domestic and dynastic difficulties faced by England and France in this period quieted the war for a decade. Henry IV died in 1413 and was replaced by his eldest son Henry V. The mental illness of Charles VI of France allowed his power to be exercised by royal princes whose rivalries caused deep divisions in France. In 1414 while Henry held court at &lt;a href=\"Leicester\"&gt;Leicester&lt;/a&gt;, he received ambassadors from Burgundy. Henry accredited envoys to the French king to make clear his territorial claims in France; he also demanded the hand of Charles VI\u2019s youngest daughter &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20of%20Valois\"&gt;Catherine of Valois&lt;/a&gt;. The French rejected his demands, leading Henry to prepare for war.\nResumption of the war under Henry V: 1415\u20131429.\nBurgundian alliance and the seizure of Paris.\nBattle of Agincourt (1415).\nIn August 1415, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20V%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry V&lt;/a&gt; sailed from England with a force of about 10,500 and laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Harfleur\"&gt;Harfleur&lt;/a&gt;. The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, Henry elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Cr%C3%A9cy\"&gt;Cr\u00e9cy&lt;/a&gt;, he found himself outmanoeuvred and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Agincourt\"&gt;Battle of Agincourt&lt;/a&gt;, north of the &lt;a href=\"Somme%20%28river%29\"&gt;Somme&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the problems and having a smaller force, his victory was near-total; the French defeat was catastrophic, costing the lives of many of the Armagnac leaders. About 40% of the French nobility was killed. Henry was apparently concerned that the large number of prisoners taken were a security risk (there were more French prisoners than there were soldiers in the entire English army) and he ordered their deaths.\nTreaty of Troyes (1420).\nHenry retook much of Normandy, including Caen in 1417, and &lt;a href=\"Rouen\"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt; on 19 January 1419, turning Normandy English for the first time in two centuries. A formal alliance was made with Burgundy, which had taken Paris after the assassination of Duke &lt;a href=\"John%20the%20Fearless\"&gt;John the Fearless&lt;/a&gt; in 1419. In 1420, Henry met with King Charles VI. They signed the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Troyes\"&gt;Treaty of Troyes&lt;/a&gt;, by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry\u2019s heirs would inherit the throne of France. The Dauphin, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VII%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles VII&lt;/a&gt;, was declared illegitimate. Henry formally entered Paris later that year and the agreement was ratified by the &lt;a href=\"Estates%20General%20%28France%29\"&gt;Estates-General&lt;/a&gt; ().\nDeath of the Duke of Clarence (1421).\nOn 22 March 1421 Henry V\u2019s progress in his French campaign experienced an unexpected reversal. Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir &lt;a href=\"Thomas%2C%20Duke%20of%20Clarence\"&gt;Thomas, Duke of Clarence&lt;/a&gt; in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Motier%20de%20La%20Fayette\"&gt;Gilbert Motier de La Fayette&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Stewart%2C%20Earl%20of%20Buchan\"&gt;John Stewart, Earl of Buchan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Baug%C3%A9\"&gt;Battle of Baug\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. Then, during the course of the battle, he led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing m\u00eal\u00e9e, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence. Once on the ground, the duke was slain by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Alexander%20Buchanan\"&gt;Alexander Buchanan&lt;/a&gt;. The body of the Duke of Clarence was recovered from the field by &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Montacute%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury\"&gt;Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury&lt;/a&gt;, who conducted the English retreat.\nEnglish success.\nHenry V returned to France and went to Paris, then visiting Chartres and G\u00e2tinais before returning to Paris. From there, he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of &lt;a href=\"Meaux\"&gt;Meaux&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422.\nAt the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at &lt;a href=\"Senlis\"&gt;Senlis&lt;/a&gt;. While there, it became apparent that he was ill (possibly &lt;a href=\"dysentery\"&gt;dysentery&lt;/a&gt;), and when he set out to the Upper Loire, he diverted to the royal castle at Vincennes, near Paris, where he died on 31 August. The elderly and insane Charles VI of France died two months later on 21 October. Henry left an only child, his nine-month-old son, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VI%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry&lt;/a&gt;, later to become Henry VI.\nOn his deathbed, as Henry VI was only an infant, Henry V had given the Duke of Bedford responsibility for English France. The war in France continued under Bedford\u2019s generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Verneuil\"&gt;Battle of Verneuil&lt;/a&gt; (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baug\u00e9, the Duke of Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army. The effect of the battle was to virtually destroy the Dauphin\u2019s field army and to eliminate the Scots as a significant military force for the rest of the war.\nFrench victory: 1429\u20131453.\nJoan of Arc and French revival.\nThe appearance of &lt;a href=\"Joan%20of%20Arc\"&gt;Joan of Arc&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans\"&gt;siege of Orl\u00e9ans&lt;/a&gt; sparked a revival of French spirit, and the tide began to turn against the English. The English laid &lt;a href=\"siege\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; to Orl\u00e9ans in 1428, but their force was insufficient to fully &lt;a href=\"investment%20%28military%29\"&gt;invest&lt;/a&gt; the city. In 1429 Joan persuaded the Dauphin to send her to the siege, saying she had received visions from God telling her to drive out the English. She raised the morale of the troops, and they attacked the English &lt;a href=\"redoubt\"&gt;redoubt&lt;/a&gt;s, forcing the English to lift the siege. Inspired by Joan, the French took several English strongholds on the Loire.\nThe English retreated from the Loire Valley, pursued by a French army. Near the village of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Patay\"&gt;Patay&lt;/a&gt;, French cavalry broke through a unit of English longbowmen that had been sent to block the road, then swept through the retreating English army. The English lost 2,200 men, and the commander, &lt;a href=\"John%20Talbot%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury\"&gt;John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt;, was taken prisoner. This victory opened the way for the Dauphin to march to &lt;a href=\"Reims\"&gt;Reims&lt;/a&gt; for his coronation as Charles VII, on 16 July 1429.\nAfter the coronation, Charles VII\u2019s army fared less well. An attempted French &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Paris%20%281429%29\"&gt;siege of Paris&lt;/a&gt; was defeated on 8 September 1429, and Charles VII withdrew to the Loire Valley.\nHenry\u2019s coronations and the desertion of Burgundy.\n&lt;a href=\"Henry%20VI%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VI&lt;/a&gt; was crowned king of England at Westminster Abbey on 5 November 1429 and king of France at Notre-Dame, in Paris, on 16 December 1431.\nJoan of Arc was captured by the Burgundians at the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Compi%C3%A8gne\"&gt;siege of Compi\u00e8gne&lt;/a&gt; on 23 May 1430. The Burgundians then transferred her to the English, who organised a trial headed by &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Cauchon\"&gt;Pierre Cauchon&lt;/a&gt;, Bishop of Beauvais and a collaborator with the English government who served as a member of the English Council at Rouen. Joan was convicted and burned at the stake on 30 May 1431 (she was rehabilitated 25 years later by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Callixtus%20III\"&gt;Pope Callixtus III&lt;/a&gt;).\nAfter the death of Joan of Arc, the fortunes of war turned dramatically against the English. Most of Henry\u2019s royal advisers were against making peace. Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Beaufort\"&gt;Cardinal Beaufort&lt;/a&gt; was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Arras%20%281435%29\"&gt;congress of Arras&lt;/a&gt;, in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20the%20Good\"&gt;Philip the Good&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"duke%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;duke of Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;, deserted to Charles VII, signing the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Arras%20%281435%29\"&gt;Treaty of Arras&lt;/a&gt; that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France. The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Plantagenet%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20York\"&gt;Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrench resurgence.\nThe allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains in the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in the rest of France. The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use. A castle that once could only be captured after a prolonged siege would now fall after a few days from cannon bombardment. The French artillery developed a reputation as the best in the world.\nBy 1449, the French had retaken &lt;a href=\"Rouen\"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt;. In 1450 the &lt;a href=\"Counts%20of%20Clermont-en-Beauvaisis\"&gt;Count of Clermont&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Arthur de Richemont&lt;/a&gt;, Earl of Richmond, of the Montfort family (the future &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Arthur III, Duke of Brittany&lt;/a&gt;), caught an English army attempting to relieve Caen and defeated it at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Formigny\"&gt;Battle of Formigny&lt;/a&gt; in 1450. Richemont\u2019s force attacked the English army from the flank and rear just as they were on the verge of beating Clermont\u2019s army.\nFrench conquest of Gascony.\nAfter Charles VII\u2019s successful Normandy campaign in 1450, he concentrated his efforts on Gascony, the last province held by the English. Bordeaux, Gascony\u2019s capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Castillon\"&gt;Battle of Castillon&lt;/a&gt; on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII\u2019s ordinance officer &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Bureau\"&gt;Jean Bureau&lt;/a&gt; and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.\nEnd of the war.\nAlthough the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War, England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Bordeaux fell to the French on 19 October and there were no more hostilities afterwards. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the &lt;a href=\"Wars%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;Wars of the Roses&lt;/a&gt; that started in 1455.\nThe Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke &lt;a href=\"Charles%20the%20Bold\"&gt;Charles of Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;, counting on English support, &lt;a href=\"Burgundian%20Wars\"&gt;took up arms&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XI%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XI&lt;/a&gt;. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying &lt;a href=\"Edward%20IV%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward IV of England&lt;/a&gt; off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Picquigny\"&gt;Treaty of Picquigny&lt;/a&gt; (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to &lt;a href=\"English%20claims%20to%20the%20French%20throne\"&gt;claim the title&lt;/a&gt; until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XVIII%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XVIII&lt;/a&gt;, who was living in England after the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome &lt;a href=\"historian\"&gt;historian&lt;/a&gt;s use the term \"The Second Hundred Years' War\" as a &lt;a href=\"periodisation\"&gt;periodisation&lt;/a&gt; to describe the series of &lt;a href=\"military%20conflict\"&gt;military conflict&lt;/a&gt;s between &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; that occurred from about 1689 (or some say 1714) to 1815. Likewise, some historians refer to the &lt;a href=\"Capetian%E2%80%93Plantagenet%20rivalry\"&gt;Capetian\u2013Plantagenet rivalry&lt;/a&gt;, series of conflicts and disputes that covered a period of 100 years (1159\u20131259) as \"The First Hundred Years War\".\nSignificance.\nHistorical significance.\nThe French victory marked the end of a long period of instability that had been seeded with the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Conquest\"&gt;Norman Conquest&lt;/a&gt; (1066), when &lt;a href=\"William%20the%20Conqueror\"&gt;William the Conqueror&lt;/a&gt; added \"King of England\" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France.\nWhen the war ended, England was bereft of its Continental possessions, leaving it with only Calais on the continent (until 1558). The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, although the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Norman%20language\"&gt;French language in England&lt;/a&gt;, which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.\nNational feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further. Despite the devastation on its soil, the Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralised state. In England the political and financial troubles which emerged from the defeat were a major cause of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;War of the Roses&lt;/a&gt; (1455\u20131487).\nHistorian Ben Lowe argued in 1997 that opposition to the war helped to shape England\u2019s early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war \u2013 sales taxes, debasing the coinage \u2013 and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French.\nA 2021 theory about the early formation of &lt;a href=\"state%20capacity\"&gt;state capacity&lt;/a&gt; is that interstate war was responsible for initiating a strong move toward states implementing tax systems with higher state capabilities. For example, see France in the Hundred Years' War, when the English occupation threatened the independent French Kingdom. The king and his ruling elite demanded consistent and permanent taxation, which would allow a permanent &lt;a href=\"standing%20army\"&gt;standing army&lt;/a&gt; to be financed. The French nobility, which had always opposed such an extension of state capacity, agreed in this exceptional situation. Hence, the inter-state war with England increased French state capability.\nBubonic &lt;a href=\"Plague%20%28disease%29\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period. France lost half its population during the Hundred Years' War, with &lt;a href=\"Normandy\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt; reduced by three-quarters and Paris by two-thirds. During the same period, England\u2019s population fell by 20 to 33 percent.\nMilitary significance.\nThe first regular standing army in Western Europe since Roman times was organised in France in 1445, partly as a solution to marauding free companies. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as \"&lt;a href=\"compagnies%20d%27ordonnance\"&gt;compagnies d'ordonnance&lt;/a&gt;\" on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors.\nThe Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war\u2019s costs, partly through advancement in technology and partly through lessons that &lt;a href=\"warfare\"&gt;warfare&lt;/a&gt; taught. The feudal system slowly disintegrated as well as the concept of chivalry.\nBy the war\u2019s end, although the heavy cavalry was still considered the most powerful unit in an army, the heavily armoured horse had to deal with several tactics developed to deny or mitigate its effective use on a battlefield. The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as &lt;a href=\"hobelar\"&gt;hobelar&lt;/a&gt;s. Hobelars' tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured horses, enabling them to move through difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Rather than fight while seated on the horse, they would dismount to engage the enemy."
