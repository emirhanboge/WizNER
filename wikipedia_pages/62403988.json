The mold was created by using the hull of one of the wooden boats and the resulting fiberglass boats retained the distinctive wooden board imprints from the mold. The 1961 Islander 24 features a trunk cabin, but the raised deck Islander 24 Bahama version proved a bigger commercial success and, as a result the Islander 24 had a relatively short production run.\nProduction.\nThe design was built by &lt;a href=\"McGlasson%20Marine\"&gt;McGlasson Marine&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Islander%20Yachts\"&gt;Islander Yachts&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; from 1964 to 1970, with 500 boats completed, but it is now out of production.\nDesign.\nThe Islander 24 Bahama is a recreational &lt;a href=\"keelboat\"&gt;keelboat&lt;/a&gt;, built predominantly of &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt;, with wood trim. It has a &lt;a href=\"masthead%20sloop\"&gt;masthead sloop&lt;/a&gt; rig, a spooned &lt;a href=\"raked%20stem\"&gt;raked stem&lt;/a&gt;, a raised &lt;a href=\"Transom%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;transom&lt;/a&gt;, a keel-mounted &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"tiller\"&gt;tiller&lt;/a&gt; and a fixed fin &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt;. It displaces and carries of lead ballast. It has a raised deck which gives a cabin with greater shoulder room, rather than a trunk cabin.\nThe boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted.\nThe boat is normally fitted with a small &lt;a href=\"outboard%20motor\"&gt;outboard motor&lt;/a&gt; for docking and maneuvering.\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a double &lt;a href=\"%26quot%3BV%26quot%3B-berth\"&gt;\"V\"-berth&lt;/a&gt; in the bow cabin and two straight settees in the main cabin. A &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; was optional. The &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is located in the bow cabin, under the \"V\"-berth. Cabin headroom is .\nThe design has a &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Handicap%20Racing%20Fleet\"&gt;PHRF&lt;/a&gt; racing average handicap of 264 and a &lt;a href=\"hull%20speed\"&gt;hull speed&lt;/a&gt; of .\nSee also.\nRelated development\nSimilar sailboats"
