    "text": "John Michael \"Jack\" Quinlan was an American politician who served as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Senate\"&gt;Massachusetts Senate&lt;/a&gt; from 1965 to 1975.\nEarly life.\nQuinlan was born on July 11, 1935 in &lt;a href=\"Natick%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Natick, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. He attended public school in &lt;a href=\"Dover%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Dover, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Heart%20Schools%20%28Kingston%2C%20Massachusetts%29\"&gt;Sacred Heart School&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated from &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20College\"&gt;Harvard College&lt;/a&gt; in 1957 and taught at &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20High%20School%20%28Massachusetts%29\"&gt;Franklin High School&lt;/a&gt; for four years.\nPolitical career.\nState senate.\nQuinlan began his political career as an assistant to &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;U.S. Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Leverett%20Saltonstall\"&gt;Leverett Saltonstall&lt;/a&gt;. In 1964 he was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Senate\"&gt;Massachusetts Senate&lt;/a&gt;. During his tenure in the Senate, Quinlan filed a number of pieces of unsuccessful legislation related to campaign finance reform.\nIn 1968, Quinlan served as the state chairman for United Citizens for &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Nixon&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Spiro%20Agnew\"&gt;Agnew&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuinlan also led a number of petition drives, including one that led to the joint election of the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Lieutenant Governor&lt;/a&gt; and 4-year terms for statewide officers.\nCampaigns for higher office.\nIn 1970, Quinlan ran for the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor. His candidacy was not supported by Governor &lt;a href=\"Francis%20W.%20Sargent\"&gt;Francis W. Sargent&lt;/a&gt;, who instead endorsed &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Linsky\"&gt;Martin Linsky&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Donald%20R.%20Dwight\"&gt;Donald R. Dwight&lt;/a&gt;, who entered the race after Linsky dropped out. Dwight won the convention nomination and Quinlan dropped out and endorsed the Sargent-Dwight ticket.\nIn 1972, Quinlan ran for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; seat in the &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%27s%209th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;Massachusetts's 9th congressional district&lt;/a&gt; held by &lt;a href=\"Louise%20Day%20Hicks\"&gt;Louise Day Hicks&lt;/a&gt;. He was favored to win the primary, but dropped out of the race, with his disenchantment with the state Republican party and the unattractive situation of having Richard Nixon on the top of the GOP ticket given as reasons for Quinlan not seeing the campaign as worthwhile.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20general%20election%2C%201974\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;, Quinlan was the Republican nominee for &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20the%20Commonwealth%20of%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. He lost to Democrat &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Guzzi\"&gt;Paul Guzzi&lt;/a&gt; 64% to 36%.\nPost-legislative career.\nAfter leaving the state senate, Quinlan served as an aide to &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services\"&gt;United States Secretary of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Heckler\"&gt;Margaret Heckler&lt;/a&gt; and was campaign director for &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Rappaport\"&gt;Jim Rappaport&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Massachusetts%2C%201990\"&gt;United States Senate in 1990&lt;/a&gt;."
