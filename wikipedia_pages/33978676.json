    "text": "RAB7, member RAS oncogene family-like 1 is a &lt;a href=\"protein\"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; that in humans is encoded by the \"RAB7L1\" &lt;a href=\"gene\"&gt;gene&lt;/a&gt;. The gene is also known as \"RAB7L\". RAB7L1 encodes a small &lt;a href=\"GTP-binding%20protein\"&gt;GTP-binding protein&lt;/a&gt; and is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Ras%20superfamily\"&gt;Ras superfamily&lt;/a&gt;.\nModel organisms.\n&lt;a href=\"Model%20organism\"&gt;Model organism&lt;/a&gt;s have been used in the study of RAB7L1 function. A conditional &lt;a href=\"knockout%20mouse\"&gt;knockout mouse&lt;/a&gt; line, called \"Rab7l1tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi\" was generated as part of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Knockout%20Mouse%20Consortium\"&gt;International Knockout Mouse Consortium&lt;/a&gt; program \u2014 a high-throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists \u2014 at the &lt;a href=\"Wellcome%20Trust%20Sanger%20Institute\"&gt;Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute&lt;/a&gt;.\nMale and female animals underwent a standardized &lt;a href=\"phenotypic%20screen\"&gt;phenotypic screen&lt;/a&gt; to determine the effects of deletion. Twenty one tests were carried out on &lt;a href=\"mutant\"&gt;mutant&lt;/a&gt; mice, but no significant abnormalities were observed."
