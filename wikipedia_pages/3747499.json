    "text": "The skipjack is a &lt;a href=\"traditional%20fishing%20boat\"&gt;traditional fishing boat&lt;/a&gt; used on the &lt;a href=\"Chesapeake%20Bay\"&gt;Chesapeake Bay&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20dredge\"&gt;oyster dredging&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt; which succeeded the &lt;a href=\"bugeye%20%28boat%29\"&gt;bugeye&lt;/a&gt; as the chief oystering boat on the bay, and it remains in service due to laws restricting the use of &lt;a href=\"powerboat\"&gt;powerboat&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; state oyster &lt;a href=\"fishery\"&gt;fishery&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign and construction.\nThe skipjack is &lt;a href=\"sloop\"&gt;sloop&lt;/a&gt;-rigged, with a sharply raked mast and extremely long boom (typically the same length as the deck of the boat). The &lt;a href=\"mainsail\"&gt;mainsail&lt;/a&gt; is ordinarily triangular, though &lt;a href=\"gaff%20rig\"&gt;gaff rig&lt;/a&gt;ged examples were built. The &lt;a href=\"jib\"&gt;jib&lt;/a&gt; is self-tending and mounted on a &lt;a href=\"bowsprit\"&gt;bowsprit&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=\"sail%20plan\"&gt;sail plan&lt;/a&gt; affords the power needed to pull the dredge, particularly in light winds, while at the same time minimizing the crew required to handle the boat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; is wooden and V-shaped, with a hard &lt;a href=\"Chine%20%28boating%29\"&gt;chine&lt;/a&gt; and a square &lt;a href=\"stern\"&gt;stern&lt;/a&gt;. In order to provide a stable platform when dredging, skipjacks have very low freeboard and a wide beam (averaging one third the length on deck). A &lt;a href=\"centerboard\"&gt;centerboard&lt;/a&gt; is mounted in lieu of a keel. The mast is hewn from a single log, with two stays on either side, without spreaders; it is stepped towards the bow of the boat, with a small cabin. As typical in regional practice the bow features a curving longhead under the bowsprit, with carved and painted trailboards. A small &lt;a href=\"Figurehead%20%28object%29\"&gt;figurehead&lt;/a&gt; is common. A typical skipjack is 40 to 50 feet in length. The boats use direct link &lt;a href=\"Edson%20worm\"&gt;Edson worm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Self-steering%20gear\"&gt;steering gear&lt;/a&gt; mounted immediately forward of the transom.\nThe dredge windlass and its motor are mounted amidships, between the mast and deckhouse. Rollers and bumpers are mounted on either side of the boat to guide the dredge line and protect the hull.\nDue to state laws, the boat has no motor (other than for the &lt;a href=\"windlass\"&gt;windlass&lt;/a&gt;). Most skipjacks were eventually modified with stern &lt;a href=\"davit\"&gt;davit&lt;/a&gt;s to hold a dinghy or pushboat to allow motorized travel as permitted by law.\nHistory.\nThe skipjack arose near the end of the 19th century. Dredging for oysters, prohibited in 1820, was again made legal in 1865. Boats of the time were unsuitable, and the &lt;a href=\"bugeye%20%28boat%29\"&gt;bugeye&lt;/a&gt; developed out of the &lt;a href=\"log%20canoe\"&gt;log canoe&lt;/a&gt; in order to provide a boat with more power adapted to the shallow waters of the oyster beds.\nThe bugeye was originally constructed with a log hull, and as the supply of appropriate timber was exhausted and construction costs rose, builders looked to other designs. They adapted the &lt;a href=\"sharpie%20%28boat%29\"&gt;sharpie&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Long%20Island%20Sound\"&gt;Long Island Sound&lt;/a&gt; by increasing the beam and simplifying the sail plan. The result was cheaper and simpler to construct than the bugeye, and it quickly became the predominant oystering boat in the bay.\nDebate remains to this day about the origins of the name. Some speculate it came from a name New England fisherman called the &lt;a href=\"flying%20fish\"&gt;flying fish&lt;/a&gt;, bonita. Still others claim it is derived from an archaic English term, meaning an \"inexpensive yet useful servant.\"\nMaryland's oyster harvest reached an all-time peak in 1884, at approximately 15 million bushels of oysters. The oyster harvest has since declined steadily, especially at the end of the 20th century. The size of the fleet has likewise declined. New skipjacks were built as late as 1993, but a change in the law in 1965 allowed the use of motor power two days of the week. As a result, few of the boats are operated under sail in commercial use; instead, a pushboat is used to move the skipjack, and little dredging is done except on the days that power is allowed.\nAt one time, the number of skipjacks produced is estimated at approximately 2,000; today, they number about 40, with fewer than half of them in active fishing. The future of the fleet remains in doubt as efforts continue to restore the productivity of the oyster beds.\nThe skipjack was designated the state boat of &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; in 1985.\n&lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Slocum\"&gt;Joshua Slocum&lt;/a&gt; piloted a modified Skipjack, a &lt;a href=\"gaff%20rigged\"&gt;gaff rigged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sloop\"&gt;sloop&lt;/a&gt; named \"&lt;a href=\"Spray%20%28sailing%20vessel%29\"&gt;Spray&lt;/a&gt;\" in the first solo global &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20circumnavigations\"&gt;circumnavigation&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote about the experience in his classic \"&lt;a href=\"Sailing%20Alone%20Around%20the%20World\"&gt;Sailing Alone Around the World&lt;/a&gt;\". \nThe rigging was modified to a &lt;a href=\"Yawl\"&gt;Yawl&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Magellan\"&gt;Strait of Magellan&lt;/a&gt;."
