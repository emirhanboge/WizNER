    "text": "Lucius Artorius Castus (&lt;a href=\"floruit\"&gt;fl.&lt;/a&gt; 2nd century AD) was a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; military commander. A member of the \"&lt;a href=\"gens\"&gt;gens&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Artoria%20gens\"&gt;Artoria&lt;/a&gt;\" (possibly of &lt;a href=\"Messapian%20language\"&gt;Messapic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Etruscan%20language\"&gt;Etruscan&lt;/a&gt; origin), he has been suggested as a potential &lt;a href=\"Historicity%20of%20King%20Arthur\"&gt;historical basis for King Arthur&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary career according to sources.\nWhat little is known of Lucius Artorius Castus comes from &lt;a href=\"inscription\"&gt;inscription&lt;/a&gt;s on fragments of a &lt;a href=\"sarcophagus\"&gt;sarcophagus&lt;/a&gt;, and a memorial plaque, found in &lt;a href=\"Podstrana\"&gt;Podstrana&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Dalmatia\"&gt;Dalmatia&lt;/a&gt;n coast in &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;. Although the inscriptions cannot be precisely dated, Castus probably served in the Roman army some time between the mid-late 2nd century AD or early to mid-3rd century AD.\nThe first inscription.\nThe sarcophagus inscription, which was broken into two pieces at some point prior to the 19th century and set into the wall of the Church of St Martin in &lt;a href=\"Podstrana\"&gt;Podstrana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, reads (note that \"7\" is a rendering of the symbol used by scribes to represent the word &lt;a href=\"centurion\"&gt;centurio&lt;/a&gt;; ligatured letters are indicated with underlines):\n D...M\n L ARTORI[...]STVS LEG\n III GALLICAE ITE[...]G VI FERRA\n TAE ITEM LEG II AD[...]TEM LEG V M\n C ITEM P P EIVSDEM [...] PRAEPOSITO\n CLASSIS MISENATIVM [..]AEFF LEG VI\n VICTRICIS DVCI LEGG [...]M BRITANICI\n MIARVM ADVERSVS ARM[...]S PROC CENTE\n NARIO PROVINCIAE LI[...] GLADI VI\n VVS IPSE SIBI ET SVIS [...]ST[...]\n&lt;a href=\"Manfred%20Clauss\"&gt;Manfred Clauss&lt;/a&gt; of the Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss-Slaby (EDCS), following the readings and expansions provided in CIL 03, 01919; CIL 03, 08513; CIL 03, 12813; Dessau 2770; IDRE-02, 303, expands the text as:\n&lt;a href=\"Hans-Georg%20Pflaum\"&gt;Hans-Georg Pflaum&lt;/a&gt; offered a slightly different expansion:\nAnthony Birley translates this as:\nLinda A.

In fact, the rendered expansion will be Lucii Artorii Casti which means: (It belongs to) Lucius Artorius Castus. \nWithout further information on the inscription, we cannot say whether or not it refers to our Lucius Artorius Castus, or simply another man of the same name.\nUnits and ranks mentioned.\nCenturion of Legio III Gallica.\nThe first unit mentioned on Castus's inscription is the &lt;a href=\"legio%20III%20Gallica\"&gt;legio III Gallica&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 for most of the 2nd and 3rd centuries the unit was stationed in &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;. He held the rank of &lt;a href=\"centurion\"&gt;centurion&lt;/a&gt; in this legion \u2013 most Roman soldiers only achieved the rank of centurion after about 15\u201320 years of service, but it was not unknown for some politically connected civilians of the equestrian class to be directly commissioned as centurions upon entering the Army, though these equestrian centurions (known as \"ex equite Romano\") were in the minority. We cannot tell whether or not Castus had a lengthy career as a &lt;a href=\"legionary\"&gt;legionary&lt;/a&gt; soldier before attaining the centurionate, or whether he was directly commissioned at this rank, as the vast majority of career centurions' inscriptions do not mention any ranks that they might have held below the centurionate. Successful officers often omitted the record of any ranks lower than primus pilus, as Castus did on his memorial plaque.\nCenturion of Legio VI Ferrata.\nFrom the middle of the 2nd century until at least the early 3rd century the &lt;a href=\"legio%20VI%20Ferrata\"&gt;legio VI Ferrata&lt;/a&gt; was stationed in &lt;a href=\"Judea\"&gt;Judea&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenturion of Legio II Adiutrix.\nFrom the early 2nd century onward the &lt;a href=\"legio%20II%20Adiutrix\"&gt;legio II Adiutrix&lt;/a&gt; were based at &lt;a href=\"Aquincum\"&gt;Aquincum&lt;/a&gt; (modern &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;) and took part in several notable campaigns against the &lt;a href=\"Parthian%20Empire\"&gt;Parthians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marcomanni\"&gt;Marcomanni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quadi\"&gt;Quadi&lt;/a&gt; and, in the mid-3rd century, the &lt;a href=\"Sassanid\"&gt;Sassanid&lt;/a&gt; empire.\nCenturion and Primus Pilus of Legio V Macedonica.\nThe &lt;a href=\"legio%20V%20Macedonica\"&gt;legio V Macedonica&lt;/a&gt; was based in &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Dacia\"&gt;Roman Dacia&lt;/a&gt; throughout the 2nd century and through most of the 3rd \u2013 the unit took part in battles against the &lt;a href=\"Marcomanni\"&gt;Marcomanni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sarmatians\"&gt;Sarmatians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quadi\"&gt;Quadi&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe legio V Macedonica after 185 CE was called \"Pia Fidelis\" or \"Pia Constans\" (shortened as P.F. or P.C.), so Castus served in this unit as &lt;a href=\"centurion\"&gt;centurion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"primus%20pilus\"&gt;primus pilus&lt;/a&gt; before 185 CE (in the inscription these nicknames are missing).\nPraepositus of the Misenum fleet.\nCastus next acted as Provost (&lt;a href=\"Praepositus\"&gt;Praepositus&lt;/a&gt;) of the &lt;a href=\"Classis%20Misenensis\"&gt;Misenum fleet&lt;/a&gt; in Italy. This title (generally given to &lt;a href=\"Equestrian%20order\"&gt;\"Equites\"&lt;/a&gt;) indicated a special command over a body of troops, but somewhat limited in action and subject to the Emperor's control.\nPraefectus of Legio VI Victrix.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Legio%20VI%20Victrix\"&gt;Legio VI Victrix&lt;/a&gt; was based in &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; from c. 122 AD onward, though their history during the 3rd century AD is rather hazy. Throughout the 2nd century AD and into the 3rd, the headquarters of the VI Victrix was at \"Eboracum\" (modern &lt;a href=\"York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;). The unit was removed briefly to \"Lugdunum\" (Lyons) in 196 AD by &lt;a href=\"Clodius%20Albinus\"&gt;Clodius Albinus&lt;/a&gt;, during his doomed revolt against the emperor &lt;a href=\"Septimius%20Severus\"&gt;Severus&lt;/a&gt;, but returned to York after the revolt was quelled \u2013 and the unit suffered a significant defeat \u2013 in 197 AD.\nCastus's position in the Legio VI Victrix, Prefect of the Legion (\"Praefectus Legionis\"), was equivalent to that of the &lt;a href=\"Praefectus%20Castrorum\"&gt;Praefectus Castrorum&lt;/a&gt;. Men who had achieved this title were normally 50\u201360 years old and had been in the army most of their lives, working their way up through the lower ranks and the centurionate until they reached &lt;a href=\"Primus%20Pilus\"&gt;Primus Pilus&lt;/a&gt; (the rank seems to have been held exclusively by &lt;a href=\"Primus%20Pilus\"&gt;primipilares&lt;/a&gt; ). They acted as third-in-command to the legionary commander, the &lt;a href=\"legatus%20legionis\"&gt;legatus legionis&lt;/a&gt;, and senior &lt;a href=\"tribune\"&gt;tribune&lt;/a&gt; and could assume command in their absence. Their day-to-day duties included maintenance of the fortress and management of the food supplies, sanitation, munitions, equipment, etc. For most who had attained this rank, it would be their last before retirement. During battles, the Praefectus Castrorum normally remained at the unit's home base with the reserve troops, so, given his administrative position and (probably) advanced age, it is unlikely that Castus actually fought in any battles while serving in Britain.\nCastus could have overseen &lt;a href=\"vexillatio\"&gt;vexillatio&lt;/a&gt;ns of troops guarding &lt;a href=\"Hadrian%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Hadrian's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, but his inscriptions do not provide us with any precise information on where he might have served while in Britain. It has been suggested by the author Linda Malcor that he was stationed at &lt;a href=\"Bremetennacum\"&gt;Bremetennacum&lt;/a&gt; with a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Sarmatians\"&gt;Sarmatians&lt;/a&gt; (originally sent to Britain in 175 AD) by emperor &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Aurelius\"&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt;, but there is no evidence to support such a conjecture. Given his duties as \"Praefectus Legionis\", it is reasonable to assume that he spent some \u2013 if not all \u2013 of his time in Britain at the VI Victrix's headquarters in York.\nIt is interesting that the title is spelled (P)RAEFF on Castus's sarcophagus \u2013 doubled letters at the end of abbreviated words on Latin inscriptions usually indicated the plural (often dual) and some legions are known to have had multiple praefecti castrorum. The title is given in the singular on the memorial plaque, though, so we might have a scribal error on the sarcophagus. If not, then Castus was probably one of two prefects of this legion.\nDux Legionum Trium \"Britanicimiarum\".\nBefore finishing his military career, Castus led an expedition of some note as a &lt;a href=\"Dux\"&gt;Dux Legionum&lt;/a&gt;, a temporary title accorded to officers who were acting in a capacity above their rank, either in command of a collection of troops (generally combined vexillations drawn from legions) in transit from one station to another or in command of a complete unit (the former seems to be the case with Castus, since the units are spoken of in the genitive plural).\nIn the third century CE the title \"dux\u201d designated an officer holding a rank above his usual rank. For instance, a dux legionis was an underling who commanded a legion, and a dux vexillatio commanded a large detachment (vexillation) of troops (Fraccaro and Ermini 1932). This evolution in the meaning of the word \"dux\u201d started in the second century under Marcus Aurelius. By the Severan period (193-211), a dux belonged to the Senatorial class (Le Bohec 1989), but prior to that an Equestrian could hold the rank. And Castus was an Equestrian.\nThe doubled \"g\u201d in LEGG indicates a plural, as opposed to PRAEFF. So how many legions the word LEGG refers to?\nThe one thing that everyone agrees on is that in the late second century there were three legions in Britannia: the II Augusta, the XX Valeria Victrix, and the VI Victrix. Translated into Latin, \"three legions\u201d gives us \"LEGG TRIUM\u201d. This renders: DVCI LEGG TRIUM BRITANNICI/MIARVM and expands to: Duci legionum trium Britannicimiarum.\nAdversus *Arm[oric(an)o]s or Adversus *Arme[nio]s?\nFor many years it has been believed that Castus's expedition was against the Armoricans (based on the reading ADVERSUS ARM[...]S, reconstructed as \"adversus *Armoricanos\" \u2013 \"against the Armoricans\" \u2013 by &lt;a href=\"Theodor%20Mommsen\"&gt;Theodor Mommsen&lt;/a&gt; in the CIL and followed by most subsequent editors of the inscription), but the earliest published reading of the inscription, made by the Croatian archaeologist in 1850, was ADVERSUS ARME[...], with a &lt;a href=\"Typographic%20ligature\"&gt;ligatured&lt;/a&gt; ME (no longer visible on the stone, possibly due to weathering, since the stone has been exposed to the elements for centuries and was reused as part of a roadside wall next to the church of St. Martin in Podstrana; the mutilated word falls along the broken right-hand edge of the first fragment of the inscription). If Carrara's reading is correct, the phrase is most likely to be reconstructed as \"adversus *Armenios\", i.e. \"against the Armenians\", since no other national or tribal name beginning with the letters *Arme- is known from this time period.\nThe regional names &lt;a href=\"Armoricani\"&gt;Armoricani&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Armorici\"&gt;Armorici&lt;/a&gt; are not attested in any other Latin inscriptions, whereas the country Armenia and derivatives such as the ethnic name &lt;a href=\"Armenii\"&gt;Armenii&lt;/a&gt; and personal name &lt;a href=\"Armeniacus\"&gt;Armeniacus&lt;/a&gt; are attested in numerous Latin inscriptions. Furthermore, no classical sources mention any military action taken against the Armorici/Armoricani (which was in origin a regional name that encompassed a number of different tribes) in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. While there are literary references to (and a small amount of archaeological evidence for) minor unrest in northwestern Gaul during this time period \u2013 often referred to as, or associated with, the rebellion of the &lt;a href=\"Bagaudae\"&gt;Bagaudae&lt;/a&gt;, there is no evidence that the Bagaudae were connected with the Armorici/Armoricani, or any other particular tribe or region for that matter, making the possible reference to the Armorici/Armoricani somewhat strange (especially since Armorica otherwise experienced a period of prosperity in the late 2nd century AD, when Malcor, \"et al\". believe that Castus's expedition took place). Armenia, on the other hand, was the location of several conflicts involving the Romans during the 2nd and 3rd centuries.\nThe alternate, \"Armenian\" translation was supported in 1881 by the epigrapher and classical scholar &lt;a href=\"Emil%20H%C3%BCbner\"&gt;Emil H\u00fcbner&lt;/a&gt;, and most recently taken up again by the historian and epigrapher &lt;a href=\"Xavier%20Loriot\"&gt;Xavier Loriot&lt;/a&gt;, who (based on the contextual and epigraphic evidence) suggests a floruit for Castus in the early mid-3rd century AD (Loriot's analysis of the inscription has recently been adopted by the Roman historians &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Birley\"&gt;Anthony Birley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marie-Henriette%20Quet\"&gt;Marie-Henriette Quet&lt;/a&gt;).\nAdversus Armatos.\nOn the other hand, \"adversus Armenios\" isn't attested in written or epigraphic sources and &lt;a href=\"Lucius%20Verus\"&gt;Lucius Verus&lt;/a&gt;'s campaigns against Parthians were meant to free the allied &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29\"&gt;kingdom of Armenia&lt;/a&gt; from the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Vologases%20IV\"&gt;Vologases IV&lt;/a&gt; king of Parthians.\nSince \"Armenios\" is not possible and since Caunius Priscus rather than Castus is the most likely officer to have been sent to Armorica, another word starting with ARM- has been suggested: \"Armatos\". The evidence for this reading lies in the widespread unrest in Britannia. The Caledonii raided south of Hadrian's Wall, destroying almost half of the VI Victrix. The &lt;a href=\"Legio%20VI%20Victrix\"&gt;VI Victrix&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Legio%20II%20Augusta\"&gt;II Augusta&lt;/a&gt; legions kept rebelling. Some legionaries tried to make a certain \"Priscus\" (likely Titus Caunius Priscus) emperor. Others tried to assassinate Pertinax. In short, there were multiple armed men causing troubles all over Britannia, and the Latin for \"armed men\" in the accusative form is \"ARMATOS\". This word fits the gap in the Castus inscription perfectly.\nThe only inscription that has the word armatos, listed under CIL 02, 05439, is not a funerary memorial stone as with that of Castus. Instead it is a series of bronze tablets unrelated to a military campaign, either external or civil. This Lex Ursonensis is the founding text of the colonia Iulia Genetiva, current Urso near Osuna, province of Seville. Additionally, rather than the word armatos, with civil wars we find the phrases rebels or public enemies used on memorial stones. An example from AD 194 reads adversus rebelles hostes publicos, \u2019against public enemies of the Roman people\u2019. With external wars against a foreign enemy the tribe or people are named. Another example from the Severan period reads: duci exercitus Illyrica expeditione Asiana item Parthica item Gallica, \u2019Leader of the Illyrican army on the Asian, Parthian and Gallic expeditions.\u2019 There is no example of Armatos being used on any similar inscription.\nThere are also a number of literary and epigraphical pieces of evidence demonstrating Roman military campaigns in Armenia against Armenians.\nIn the Parthian War of AD 161-6 under Lucius Verus the general Priscus led the advance through Armenia and captured the Armenian capital at Artaxata. Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus subsequently awarded themselves the titles of Armeniacus, Parthicus, Medicus and pater patriae. Around ad 214\u2013216 the Armenia King Khosrov I was imprisoned by the Romans. The Armenians rebelled and Caracalla sent Theocritus who led an army to defeat. However after a subsequent successful campaign Caracalla did eventually grant the Armenian crown to Tiridates II c. AD 217 and Armenia returned under Roman influence. \nIn the reign of Macrinus, AD 217-8, the Historia Augusta states there was a \u2018dux Armeniae erat et item legatus Asiae atque Arabiae\u2019. In c. AD 233 Severus Alexander launched a three prong attack against the Persians with the northern army invading through Armenia. Alexander drew troops from the Rhine and Danube on his march east, and we have various inscriptions dated to ad 232\u20135 honouring men who died in \u2018expediteone Partica et Armeniaca\u2019. \nBritanicimiarum.\nThe name of the units that Castus led in this expedition, \"Britanicimiarum\", seems to be corrupt \u2013 it might be reconstructed as \"*Britanniciniarum\" or \"*Britannicianarum\". If so, they were probably units similar in nature to the \"&lt;a href=\"Ala%20%28Roman%20cavalry%20unit%29\"&gt;ala&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"cohors\"&gt;cohors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"I%20Britannica\"&gt;I Britannica&lt;/a&gt;\" (also known as the \"I Flavia Britannica\" or\" Britanniciana\", among other titles), which were stationed in Britain in the mid-1st century AD, but removed to &lt;a href=\"Vindobona\"&gt;Vindobona&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pannonia\"&gt;Pannonia&lt;/a&gt; by the late 80s AD (they would later take part in &lt;a href=\"Roman%E2%80%93Parthian%20Wars%23Trajan%27s%20Parthian%20War\"&gt;Trajan's Parthian War&lt;/a&gt; of 114\u2013117 AD and &lt;a href=\"Trebonianus%20Gallus\"&gt;Trebonianus Gallus'&lt;/a&gt; Persian war of 252 AD). Though the name of the unit was derived from its early service in Britain, the unit was not generally composed of ethnic Britons. No units of this name are believed to have been active in Britain during the late 2nd century.\nIn an inscription from &lt;a href=\"Sirmium\"&gt;Sirmium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pannonia\"&gt;Pannonia&lt;/a&gt; dating to the reign of the emperor &lt;a href=\"Gallienus\"&gt;Gallienus&lt;/a&gt; (CIL 3, 3228), we have mention of &lt;a href=\"vexillatio\"&gt;vexillatio&lt;/a&gt;ns of legions \"*Brittan(n)icin(arum)\" (\"militum vexill(ationum) legg(ionum) ]G]ermaniciana[r(um)] [e]t Brittan(n)icin(arum)\") \u2013 another form that is very similar to the \"*Britan(n)icimiarum\" from Castus's inscription.\nActually, Britanicimiarum is not a mistake by the carver but a variant of Britannicianarum.\nLike Germanicianarum is a plural genitive of praedial Germanicianus, similarly Britannicianarum comes from Britannicianus and it means \"serving in Britain\".\nThe suffixes -inus, -enus, -anus, -ianus, and -unus indicate origin or possession. Britannicinus, Britannicanus, Britannicianus are some examples and are equivalent. Furthermore, in linguistics we have the dissimilation process (L\u2194R, N\u2194M).In our case, because of the dissimilation of Latin terms, BRITAN(N)ICINUS becomes BRITAN(N)ICIMUS&gt;BRITAN(N)ICIMIUS nominative of the word BRITAN(N)ICIMIARUM in the inscription.\nProcurator Centenarius of Liburnia.\nExceptionally talented, experienced and/or connected Praefects Castrorum/Legionis could sometimes move on to higher civilian positions such as &lt;a href=\"Procurator%20%28Roman%29\"&gt;Procurator&lt;/a&gt;, which Castus indeed managed to accomplish after retiring from the army. He became \"&lt;a href=\"procurator%20centenarius\"&gt;procurator centenarius&lt;/a&gt;\" (governor) of &lt;a href=\"Liburnia\"&gt;Liburnia&lt;/a&gt;, a part of Roman &lt;a href=\"Dalmatia\"&gt;Dalmatia&lt;/a&gt;, today's &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;. (\"centenarius\" indicates that he received a salary of 100,000 &lt;a href=\"sesterces\"&gt;sesterces&lt;/a&gt; per year). \nCastus was appointed procurator centenarius of the province of Liburnia with ius gladii, the power to put anyone, even Senators, to death. The beginning of the last line of the inscription has always been reconstructed as \u201cvivus ipse sibi et suis\u201d with the VI of VIVVS, for some reason, following gladi even though the bottom line, which is centered, had plenty of room for it. The last line is complete, with VVS standing for VIVVS, and that the VI is a number that belongs where it was placed: after gladi. In this case Castus was 'procurator centenarius provinciae Liburniae ius gladii' \"six times\" from 191 to 197. Nothing further is known of him. Other Artorii are attested in the area, but it is unknown if Lucius Artorius Castus started this branch of the family in Dalmatia, or whether the family had already been settled there prior to his birth (if the latter, Castus might have received the Liburnian procuratorship because he was a native of the region).\nThe date of Lucius Artorius Castus's \"floruit\".\nNo dates are given in either inscription, making it difficult to offer a precise date for them, no less Lucius Artorius Castus's \"floruit\". The late French epigraphy expert Xavier Loriot suggested that Lucius Artorius Castus's expedition against the Armenians (as he reads the main inscription) could have taken place in 215 AD, under the reign of emperor &lt;a href=\"Caracalla\"&gt;Caracalla&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps later, in 232 AD, under the reign of &lt;a href=\"Severus%20Alexander\"&gt;Severus Alexander&lt;/a&gt; (when P. Aelius Hammonius led a Cappadocian force in Severus's Persian war). Three Croatian archaeologists examined the inscriptions in 2012, as part of an international conference on Lucius Artorius Castus organized by authors Linda Malcor and &lt;a href=\"John%20and%20Caitlin%20Matthews\"&gt;John Matthews&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Nenad%20Cambi\"&gt;Nenad Cambi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C5%BDeljko%20Mileti%C4%87\"&gt;\u017deljko Mileti\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Miroslav%20Glavi%C4%8Di%C4%87\"&gt;Miroslav Glavi\u010di\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. Cambi proposes that Lucius Artorius Castus' career can be dated to the late 2nd century AD and his death to the late 2nd, or perhaps early 3rd century AD. Glavi\u010di\u0107 dates Lucius Artorius Castus's military career to the middle- through late-2nd century AD and proposes that he was the first governor of the province of Liburnia, which Glavi\u010di\u0107 suggests was only established as a separate province from Dalmatia circa 184\u2013185 AD. Mileti\u0107 dates Lucius Artorius Castus's military career to circa 121\u2013166 AD and his procuratorship of the province of Liburnia to circa 167\u2013174 AD. Cambi, Mileti\u0107, and Glavi\u010di\u0107 all accept the reading \"(adversus) Armenios\", \"against the Armenians\" (with Cambi offering \"Armorios\" [an abbreviation of \"Armoric[an]os\"] as an alternate possibility); Mileti\u0107 places the expedition against the Armenians during emperor &lt;a href=\"Lucius%20Verus\"&gt;Lucius Verus&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Roman%E2%80%93Parthian%20War%20of%20161%E2%80%93166\"&gt;Parthian war&lt;/a&gt; of 161\u2013166 AD.\nLinda Malcor and her colleagues propose, in the last published work, that Castus' career is entirely dated in the second century CE.\nLoriot is simply wrong when he asserts that \"procuratores ius gladii\" must date to the third century since the rank is amply attested prior to the reign of Septimius Severus and the last mention of \"jus gladii\" is in 227 CE.\nSince the rank of praepositus classis did not exist before the year 170 CE and Castus's term as praepositus was followed by three or four (he was twice praefect) posts, at least ten years more, his career could not have ended until after 180 CE, due to the restriction of the ranks of \"praepositus classis\" and dux for Senators during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, nor could it have lasted until the reign of Alexander Severus because of the explicit mention of \"ius gladii\", which was no longer necessary, and, therefore, fell out of use, after Constitutio Antoniniana of 212 CE. Although during the reign of Severus Alexander (ad 222\u2013235), Sellustius Sempronius Victor was awarded the ius gladii to clear the sea of pirates around Bithynia and Pontus. This shows a mid third century date is possible.\nIn 175 when Castus was primus pilus of V Macedonica the Iazyges made a treaty with Marcus Aurelius that gave the Romans 8,000 of their heavy cavalry, \"5,500 of whom were sent to Britannia\". There is no evidence they arrived or where they were posted if they did. However one piece of epigraphical evidence from Ribchester suggests the survival of a at least one unit name, numeri equitum Sarmatarum Bremetennacensium, dated to c.241. However the survival of a unit name does not indicate ethnicity. \nMoreover, the Liburnian area was organized as procuratorial province in 184-185 until the end of the second century or the beginning of the third.\nThe absolute \"terminus post quem non\" for the dissolution of the procuratorial province of Liburnia is 239, when Domitius Gallicanus Papinianus entered service. Castus was a procurator Augusti \"cum iure gladii\" in the last part of the second century CE (prior to that Liburnia probably was still under control of governorship of &lt;a href=\"Cassius%20Apronianus\"&gt;Marcus Cassius Apronianus&lt;/a&gt;) or the first half of the third century.\nIdentification with King Arthur.\nIn 1924, &lt;a href=\"Kemp%20Malone\"&gt;Kemp Malone&lt;/a&gt; was the first to suggest the possibility that Lucius Artorius Castus was the inspiration for the figure of &lt;a href=\"King%20Arthur\"&gt;Arthur&lt;/a&gt; in medieval European literature. More recent champions have included authors &lt;a href=\"C.%20Scott%20Littleton\"&gt;C. Scott Littleton&lt;/a&gt; and Linda Malcor. The hypothesis has been heavily criticized by prominent Arthurian scholars due to the historical Artorius Castus having very little in common with the Arthurian legends and the arguments relying excessively on speculation and wishful thinking.\nDue to the significant differences between the persons and careers of the historical Lucius Artorius Castus and the traditional King Arthur, the consensus of mainstream historians is that it is very unlikely the former inspired the latter. For example, Lucius Artorius Castus was not contemporaneous with the Saxon invasions of Britain in the 5th century CE which gave rise to the Arthurian legends, and some of the earliest written references to Arthur are of him fighting against the Saxons. The strongest link between them may be the extended family or clan name \"Artorius\" which may have developed into the personal name \"Arthur\", but this does not necessarily mean Lucius Artorius Castus himself inspired the legends. The possibility, however unlikely or remote, is nonetheless real that he was remembered in local tales that grew in the retelling. No definitive proof, however, has yet been established that Lucius Artorius Castus was the \"real\" King Arthur.\nLucius Artorius Castus as King Arthur in modern entertainment.\nIn the film \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Arthur%20%282004%20film%29\"&gt;King Arthur&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"2004%20in%20film\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;), Lucius Artorius Castus is partially identified with King Arthur. The film asserts that Arthur's Roman name was \"Artorius Castus\", and that Artorius was an ancestral name derived from that of a famous leader. His \"floruit\" (\"prime time\") is, however, pushed a few centuries later so that he is made a contemporary of the invading Saxons in the 5th century CE. This would be in agreement with native Welsh tradition regarding Arthur, although his activities are placed many decades or sometimes centuries earlier than the medieval sources assign to him. As a research consultant for the film \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Arthur%20%282004%20film%29\"&gt;King Arthur&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"2004%20in%20film\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;), Linda Malcor's hypotheses regarding Lucius Artorius Castus were the primary inspiration for the screenplay.\nIn the manga \"&lt;a href=\"Vinland%20Saga%20%28manga%29\"&gt;Vinland Saga&lt;/a&gt;\", Lucius Artorius Castus is the real name of the half-Danish half-Welsh character &lt;a href=\"Vinland%20Saga%20%28manga%29%23Characters\"&gt;Askeladd&lt;/a&gt;, who is descended from the Romano-British Artorius (full name not given) who fought the Saxons centuries before.\nIn \"\", one of the historical battle scenarios features the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mons%20Badonicus\"&gt;Battle of Badon Hill&lt;/a&gt; with Lucius Artorius Castus as commander of the Romano-British forces\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Fate/stay%20night\"&gt;Fate/stay night&lt;/a&gt;\" the character Saber is a female King Arthur. Her true name, Artoria, is according to &lt;a href=\"TYPE-MOON\"&gt;TYPE-MOON&lt;/a&gt; meant to be a feminine form of Artorius."
