    "title": "List of largest sports contracts",
    "text": "This is a list of the largest sports contracts. These figures include &lt;a href=\"signing%20bonus\"&gt;signing bonus&lt;/a&gt;es but exclude options, &lt;a href=\"buyout\"&gt;buyout&lt;/a&gt;s, and the endorsement deals. This list does not reflect the highest annual salaries or career earnings, only the top 100 largest contracts and thus is largely limited to athletes in &lt;a href=\"team%20sports\"&gt;team sports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"auto%20racing\"&gt;auto racing&lt;/a&gt;. Athletes in &lt;a href=\"individual%20sport\"&gt;individual sport&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"table%20tennis\"&gt;table tennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kickboxing\"&gt;kickboxing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"MMA\"&gt;MMA&lt;/a&gt;, are not employed by a team and usually earn money primarily through event winnings. This list also does not necessarily reflect actual money collected by the athletes, since some contracts are eventually terminated (usually due to an athlete either retiring or invoking their opt-out clause).\nEntries in this list also require an individual citation of the contract, so a number of the highest salaried athletes (according to \"&lt;a href=\"Forbes%27%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20highest-paid%20athletes\"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;\") are not included as their contract details have not been officially confirmed, including the likes of &lt;a href=\"Cristiano%20Ronaldo\"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Federer\"&gt;Roger Federer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20Hamilton\"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;. This also skews the list towards sports with &lt;a href=\"salary%20cap\"&gt;salary cap&lt;/a&gt;s where salaries are therefore public knowledge and easy to cite.\nThe contract figures referenced below are presented at face value and do not reflect potential pre or post-tax treatments. For example, contracts with European sports teams are typically quoted on a post-tax basis.\nLargest sports contracts.\n\"R \u2013 retired\" \n\"Injury \u2013 While still technically under contract, injury has ended his career\"\n\"* \u2013 no longer on team (or with streaming service)\"\n\"\u2021 \u2013 entirety of contract salary not guaranteed\"\n\"(tie) \u2013 score of two or more above mentioned athletes heretofore considered equal if their contracts have been signed within a given timeframe providing negligible &lt;a href=\"inflation\"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt; ratio (during the same year)\""
