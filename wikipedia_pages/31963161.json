    "text": "The 2011 Hazfi Cup Final was a &lt;a href=\"Two-legged%20tie\"&gt;two-legged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; tie in order to determine the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Hazfi%20Cup\"&gt;2010\u201311 Hazfi Cup&lt;/a&gt; champion of &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian football clubs. &lt;a href=\"Persepolis%20F.C.\"&gt;Persepolis&lt;/a&gt; faced &lt;a href=\"Malavan%20F.C.\"&gt;Malavan&lt;/a&gt; in this final game. The first leg took place on June 7, 2011 at 19:45 &lt;a href=\"Iran%20Standard%20Time\"&gt;IRDT&lt;/a&gt; () at &lt;a href=\"Azadi%20Stadium\"&gt;Azadi Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tehran\"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; and the second leg took place on June 10, 2011 at 17:00 &lt;a href=\"Iran%20Standard%20Time\"&gt;local time&lt;/a&gt; () at Takhti Stadium, &lt;a href=\"Bandar%20Anzali\"&gt;Bandar Anzali&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormat.\nThe rules for the final were exactly the same as the one for the previous knockout rounds. The tie was contested over two legs with &lt;a href=\"Away%20goals%20rule\"&gt;away goals&lt;/a&gt; deciding the winner if the two teams were level on goals after the second leg. If the teams could still not be separated at that stage, then &lt;a href=\"extra%20time\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt; would have been played with a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty shootout&lt;/a&gt; (taking place if the teams were still level after that)."
