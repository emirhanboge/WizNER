Bush&lt;/a&gt;, Ambassador Noriega was responsible for managing U.S. foreign policy and promoting U.S. interests in the region. Noriega was a major force behind the Bush Administration's policy towards &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. In 1996, Noriega co-authored the &lt;a href=\"Helms-Burton%20law\"&gt;Helms-Burton law&lt;/a&gt; which tightened the 40-year-old embargo on Cuba. In April 2002, Noriega was Ambassador to the &lt;a href=\"Organization%20of%20American%20States\"&gt;Organization of American States&lt;/a&gt; during the temporary ouster of Venezuelan president &lt;a href=\"Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez\"&gt;Hugo Ch\u00e1vez&lt;/a&gt;. Noriega resigned from the State Department in 2005 amid criticism from Senior State Department officials aiming to ease tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela to join the private sector.\nPrivate career.\nUpon entering the private sector as a lobbyist in 2005, Noriega went to work for Miami-based law firm Tew Cardenas LLP, which, according to LD-2 reports filed in the second quarter of 2004, was actively lobbying for the interests of free-market proponent organizations in Haiti. At the time of &lt;a href=\"Posada%20Carriles\"&gt;Posada Carriles&lt;/a&gt;' reported presence in the U.S. in 2005, Noriega stated that the United States government was not then aware of his presence, saying that the controversy over his presence in the country, \"may be a completely manufactured issue,\" and that Posada \"might not have been in the United States.\"\nSince leaving the State Department, he has lobbied U.S. representatives to support Venezuelan opposition leaders such as &lt;a href=\"Leopoldo%20L%C3%B3pez\"&gt;Leopoldo Lopez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mar%C3%ADa%20Corina%20Machado\"&gt;Mar\u00eda Corina Machado&lt;/a&gt;. Notable clients represented by Noriega include multi-billion dollar global hedge fund &lt;a href=\"Elliott%20Management%20Corporation\"&gt;Elliott Management Corp&lt;/a&gt;, which Noriega assisted through \"federal advocacy on behalf of US investors in Latin America\", and political interest group Moroccan American Center for Policy, providing assistance and support for the settlement of Western Sahara issue. In 2008, Noriega partnered with Venezuelan exile and former PDVSA &amp; IMF employee Martin Rodil to form a private risk assessment and lobbying firm called Vision Americas, through which, in 2009, he was hired as a U.S. lobbyist by an organization of the private sector of Honduras during the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Honduran%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt; when President &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Zelaya\"&gt;Manuel Zelaya&lt;/a&gt; was ousted. According to the disclosure form, Noriega and Vision Americas were hired to \"Support the efforts of the Honduran private sector to help consolidate the democratic transition in their country\". Noriega had previously claimed that the democratically elected Zelaya posed a threat to the region because Honduras was ground zero in what he described as \"the continued spread of &lt;a href=\"Chavismo\"&gt;Chavista&lt;/a&gt; authoritarianism under the guise of democracy\". Other lobbying activities conducted by Roger Noriega through Vision Americas include a $25,000 contract in 2010 with Venezuelan firm Alodiga, claiming to \"support the client's registration and regulatory issues\", and a $45,000 contract in 2016 with the Haitian branch of global industrial, financial, supply chain, and telecommunications giant GB Group, owned by billionaire opportunist and prospector &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Bigio\"&gt;Gilbert Bigio&lt;/a&gt; which specified an initiative related to \"educating U.S. stakeholders about the economic opportunities of a modern port system in Haiti\".\nNoriega signed the &lt;a href=\"Madrid%20Charter\"&gt;\"Madrid Charter\"&lt;/a&gt;, a document drafted by the &lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; Spanish political party &lt;a href=\"Vox%20%28political%20party%29\"&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt; that describes left-wing groups as enemies of &lt;a href=\"Ibero-America\"&gt;Ibero-America&lt;/a&gt; involved in a \"criminal project\" that are \"under the umbrella of the Cuban regime\"."
