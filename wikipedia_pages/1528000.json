It stretches from the &lt;a href=\"Gourits%20River\"&gt;Gourits River&lt;/a&gt; in the west to beyond the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Brak%20River%20%28river%29\"&gt;Great Brak River&lt;/a&gt; in the east. It is drained by the Gourits, &lt;a href=\"Hartenbos%20River\"&gt;Hartenbos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Brak%20River%20%28river%29\"&gt;Little Brak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Brak%20River%20%28river%29\"&gt;Great Brak&lt;/a&gt; Rivers. It abuts on the &lt;a href=\"Hessequa%20Municipality\"&gt;Hessequa Municipality&lt;/a&gt; to the west, the &lt;a href=\"Oudtshoorn%20Municipality\"&gt;Oudtshoorn Municipality&lt;/a&gt; to the north and the &lt;a href=\"George%20Municipality\"&gt;George Municipality&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20National%20Census%20of%202011\"&gt;2011 census&lt;/a&gt; the municipality has a population of 89,430 people in 28,025 households. Of this population, 43.5% describe themselves as \"&lt;a href=\"Coloured\"&gt;Coloured&lt;/a&gt;\", 29.5% as \"&lt;a href=\"Bantu%20peoples%20in%20South%20Africa\"&gt;Black African&lt;/a&gt;\", and 25.5% as \"&lt;a href=\"White%20South%20African\"&gt;White&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"first%20language\"&gt;first language&lt;/a&gt; of 67.6% of the population is &lt;a href=\"Afrikaans\"&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/a&gt;, while 21.5% speak &lt;a href=\"Xhosa%20language\"&gt;Xhosa&lt;/a&gt;, 6.5% speak &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and 1.3% speak &lt;a href=\"Sotho%20language\"&gt;Sotho&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe principal town is &lt;a href=\"Mossel%20Bay\"&gt;Mossel Bay&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20St%20Blaize\"&gt;Cape St Blaize&lt;/a&gt; peninsula, which as of 2011 has a population of 59,031. Northeast of Mossel Bay is a string of coastal resorts along the shores of the bay: &lt;a href=\"Hartenbos\"&gt;Hartenbos&lt;/a&gt; (pop. 4,196), &lt;a href=\"Little%20Brak%20River%20%28town%29\"&gt;Little Brak River&lt;/a&gt; (pop. 2,037), &lt;a href=\"Reebok%2C%20Western%20Cape\"&gt;Reebok&lt;/a&gt; (pop. 1,112), &lt;a href=\"Tergniet\"&gt;Tergniet&lt;/a&gt; (pop. 1,264) and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Brak%20River%20%28town%29\"&gt;Great Brak River&lt;/a&gt; (pop. 10,619). To the southwest of Mossel Bay are the smaller coastal villages of &lt;a href=\"Boggomsbaai\"&gt;Boggomsbaai&lt;/a&gt; (pop. 69) and &lt;a href=\"Vleesbaai\"&gt;Vleesbaai&lt;/a&gt; (pop. 193). &lt;a href=\"Herbertsdale\"&gt;Herbertsdale&lt;/a&gt; (pop. 666), &lt;a href=\"Brandwag%2C%20Mossel%20Bay\"&gt;Brandwag&lt;/a&gt; (pop. 1,470) and &lt;a href=\"Friemersheim\"&gt;Friemersheim&lt;/a&gt; (pop. 1,235) are situated in the interior of the municipality closer to the mountains.\nHistory.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"apartheid\"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt; era, the area that is today the Mossel Bay Municipality formed part of the South Cape Regional Services Council (RSC). The towns of &lt;a href=\"Mossel%20Bay\"&gt;Mossel Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hartenbos\"&gt;Hartenbos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Brak%20River%20%28town%29\"&gt;Great Brak River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herbertsdale\"&gt;Herbertsdale&lt;/a&gt; were governed by municipal councils elected by their &lt;a href=\"white%20South%20African\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; residents. The &lt;a href=\"coloured\"&gt;coloured&lt;/a&gt; residents of &lt;a href=\"D%27Almeida\"&gt;D'Almeida&lt;/a&gt; (Mossel Bay) and Great Brak River were governed by management committees subordinate to the white councils. &lt;a href=\"Kwanonqaba\"&gt;Kwanonqaba&lt;/a&gt; was governed by a town council established under the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Local%20Authorities%20Act%2C%201982\"&gt;Black Local Authorities Act, 1982&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller coastal resorts were governed by local councils: a council for &lt;a href=\"Boggomsbaai\"&gt;Boggomsbaai&lt;/a&gt;, a council covering &lt;a href=\"Little%20Brak%20River%20%28town%29\"&gt;Little Brak River&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reebok%2C%20Western%20Cape\"&gt;Reebok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tergniet\"&gt;Tergniet&lt;/a&gt;, and another council named Gleniqua covering &lt;a href=\"Glentana\"&gt;Glentana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Outeniquastrand\"&gt;Outeniquastrand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bothastrand\"&gt;Bothastrand&lt;/a&gt;. The former missionary settlement of &lt;a href=\"Friemersheim\"&gt;Friemersheim&lt;/a&gt; was governed by a board of management.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Negotiations%20to%20end%20apartheid%20in%20South%20Africa\"&gt;negotiations to end apartheid&lt;/a&gt; were taking place a process was established for local authorities to agree on voluntary mergers. In March 1992, the Municipality of Great Brak River, the Great Brak River Management Committee and the Gleniqua Local Council merged into a single Municipality for the Area of Great Brak River.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20general%20election%2C%201994\"&gt;national elections of 1994&lt;/a&gt; a process of local government transformation began, in which negotiations were held between the existing local authorities, political parties, and local community organisations. As a result of these negotiations, the existing local authorities were dissolved and transitional local councils (TLCs) were created for each town and village. The smaller seaside resorts were also combined with larger towns.\nThe transitional councils were initially made up of members nominated by the various parties to the negotiations, until May 1996 when &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20South%20African%20municipal%20elections\"&gt;elections were held&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of these elections the South Cape District Council was established in place of the South Cape RSC, and transitional representative councils (TRCs) were elected to represent rural areas outside the TLCs on the District Council. The area that was to become Mossel Bay Municipality included the Mossel Bay TRC and a small part of the Outeniqua TRC.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20municipal%20election%2C%202000\"&gt;local elections of December 2000&lt;/a&gt; the TLCs and TRCs were dissolved and the Mossel Bay Municipality was established as a single local authority. At the same election the South Cape District Council was dissolved and replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Eden%20District%20Municipality\"&gt;Eden District Municipality&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitics.\nThe municipal council consists of twenty-nine members elected by &lt;a href=\"mixed-member%20proportional%20representation\"&gt;mixed-member proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;. Fifteen councillors are elected by &lt;a href=\"first-past-the-post%20voting\"&gt;first-past-the-post voting&lt;/a&gt; in fifteen &lt;a href=\"ward%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;wards&lt;/a&gt;, while the remaining fourteen are chosen from &lt;a href=\"party%20list\"&gt;party list&lt;/a&gt;s so that the total number of party representatives is proportional to the number of votes received.\nMarie Ferreira of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Alliance%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Democratic Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (DA) became executive mayor after the March 2006 local government elections when the DA formed a coalition with &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Civic%20Organisation%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;Independent Civic Organisation of South Africa&lt;/a&gt; (ICOSA) since no single party had obtained an outright majority. The DA held 10 seats in the (then) 23-seat council followed by 8 for the &lt;a href=\"African%20National%20Congress\"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; (ANC) and 3 for ICOSA. Following the September 2007, floor-crossing window the DA gained an outright majority when 3 councillors defected to the DA resulting in the DA holding 13 seats out of 23 while the ANC lost a seat to the DA and currently has 7. ICOSA lost its representation in the council when 2 councillors defected to the DA and its one ward councillor became an independent.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20municipal%20election%2C%202011\"&gt;election of 18 May 2011&lt;/a&gt; the DA won a majority of sixteen seats on the council. In the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20municipal%20election%2C%202016\"&gt;election of 3 August 2016&lt;/a&gt; the DA increased its majority to seventeen seats. The DA further expanded that majority to nineteen seats in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20South%20African%20municipal%20elections\"&gt;election of 1 November 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The following table shows the results of the 2021 election.\nLow crime rates.\nIn 2007, crime figures revealed that Mossel Bay recorded the lowest crime rates in the country. Between August 2006 and July 2007, there were no murders, hijackings, or business robberies. The low unemployment rate has been cited as a factor for the low crime rates."
