In the 1973 bloodbath against &lt;a href=\"Cronulla%20Sharks\"&gt;Cronulla&lt;/a&gt; he single-handedly took control of the game scoring two tries to take the side to victory.\nAt the end of the 1976 season Fulton caused a sensation in Sydney rugby league circles when he left Manly and signed a 3-year deal with the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Roosters\"&gt;Eastern Suburbs&lt;/a&gt; club. He left Manly holding the club record for most tries.\nWarrington Wolves.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"1969%20NSWRFL%20season\"&gt;1969 NSWRFL season&lt;/a&gt;, Fulton accepted an offer to play a season with his 'home town' club &lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Wolves\"&gt;Warrington&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1969%E2%80%9370%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20League%20season\"&gt;1969\u201370 English season&lt;/a&gt;.

He was named as the World Cup Man of the Series in 1970. The same knee injury that would eventually force his retirement as a player in 1979 would keep him from Australia's winning &lt;a href=\"1977%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1977 Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt; squad.\nHe was honoured with the Australian captaincy in the 2nd and 3rd Tests of the 1978 series against New Zealand and in all five Tests of the &lt;a href=\"1978%20Kangaroo%20Tour\"&gt;1978 Kangaroo Tour&lt;/a&gt;, though that included the 2\u20130 series loss to France at the end of the tour, the last time Australia would lose a series or tournament until the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Rugby%20League%20Tri-Nations\"&gt;2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations&lt;/a&gt;.

He represented Australia in 20 Test matches, 15 World Cup matches and 22 minor internationals whilst on tour.\nPost playing.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring as a player at Easts, Fulton became coach of the Roosters. His was one of the few clubs opposed to the &lt;a href=\"rugby%20League%20State%20of%20Origin\"&gt;State of Origin&lt;/a&gt; concept when it first began and he called it the \"non-event of the century\". At the end of his first season as coach, he took Easts to the &lt;a href=\"1980%20NSWRFL%20season%23Grand%20Final\"&gt;1980 Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; where they were beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Canterbury-Bankstown%20Bulldogs\"&gt;Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs&lt;/a&gt;. He went on to coach the Roosters for two more seasons.\nHe returned to Manly as coach in &lt;a href=\"1983%20NSWRFL%20season\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt; and in that same year took them to a Grand Final against the &lt;a href=\"Parramatta%20Eels\"&gt;Parramatta Eels&lt;/a&gt; where the club was unsuccessful for the second year running.

Following the grand final victory, he travelled with Manly to England for the &lt;a href=\"1987%20World%20Club%20Challenge\"&gt;1987 World Club Challenge&lt;/a&gt; against their champions, &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Warriors\"&gt;Wigan&lt;/a&gt;, though Manly-Warringah were beaten in a tryless game 8-2.\nIn 1989, Fulton succeeded &lt;a href=\"Don%20Furner\"&gt;Don Furner&lt;/a&gt; as coach of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Kangaroos\"&gt;Australian national side&lt;/a&gt;.
