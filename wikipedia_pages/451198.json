    "text": "Forest Green Rovers Football Club is a professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Nailsworth\"&gt;Nailsworth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire\"&gt;Gloucestershire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The team competes in and have played their home games at &lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Lawn\"&gt;The New Lawn&lt;/a&gt; since 2006, when they moved from their original home at &lt;a href=\"The%20Lawn%20Ground\"&gt;The Lawn Ground&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormed in October 1889, the club became founder members of the Mid Gloucestershire League five years later. Competing in various local league competitions for much of the 20th century, they won a multitude of league titles: the Dursley &amp; District League (1902\u201303), the &lt;a href=\"Stroud%20and%20District%20Football%20League\"&gt;Stroud and District Football League&lt;/a&gt; (1911\u201312 and 1920\u201321), the Stroud Premier League (1934\u201335, 1935\u201336 and 1936\u201337), the North Gloucestershire League (1920\u201321 and 1921\u201322), and the &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire%20Northern%20Senior%20League\"&gt;Gloucestershire Northern Senior League&lt;/a&gt; (1937\u201338, 1949\u201350 and 1950\u201351). They became founder members of the &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire%20County%20Football%20League\"&gt;Gloucestershire County League&lt;/a&gt; in 1968, before they were moved up to the Premier Division of the &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Football%20League\"&gt;Hellenic League&lt;/a&gt; seven years later.\nForest Green won the Hellenic League in the 1981\u201382 season and lifted the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Vase\"&gt;FA Vase&lt;/a&gt; after beating &lt;a href=\"Rainworth%20Miners%20Welfare%20F.C.\"&gt;Rainworth Miners Welfare&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1982%20FA%20Vase%20Final\"&gt;the final&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt;. They spent the next 13 years in the Midland Division of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt;, and briefly competed under the name Stroud F.C. Reverting to the name Forest Green Rovers, the club won successive Southern League Southern Division and Premier Division titles in 1996\u201397 and 1997\u201398, winning promotion into the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20%28English%20football%29\"&gt;Conference&lt;/a&gt;. Reaching the &lt;a href=\"1999%20FA%20Trophy%20Final\"&gt;1999 FA Trophy Final&lt;/a&gt;, which they lost, they became the first club to reach the finals of both the FA Vase and FA Trophy. They also reached the &lt;a href=\"2001%20FA%20Trophy%20Final\"&gt;2001 FA Trophy Final&lt;/a&gt;, which again they lost. Twice reprieved from relegation from the Conference National due to the demotion of other clubs, the club was transformed following investment from green energy industrialist &lt;a href=\"Dale%20Vince\"&gt;Dale Vince&lt;/a&gt; in 2010.\nUnder Dale Vince's chairmanship Forest Green became the world's first &lt;a href=\"Veganism\"&gt;vegan&lt;/a&gt; football club in 2015, and the New Lawn was installed with numerous eco-friendly innovations. Investment in the playing squad saw the club compete for promotion into the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;English Football League&lt;/a&gt;, which they achieved with victory in the &lt;a href=\"2017%20National%20League%20play-off%20Final\"&gt;2017 National League play-offs&lt;/a&gt;, having been beaten in the semi-finals in 2015 and in the &lt;a href=\"2016%20National%20League%20play-off%20Final\"&gt;2016 final&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLocal and county leagues.\nThe club was established in 1889 by Rev. E.J.H. Peach, representing the Forest Green area of Nailsworth. The name Rovers was adopted in 1893, and the following year the club were founder members of the Mid-Gloucestershire League. Their first home league match on 6 October was a 1\u20131 draw with &lt;a href=\"Brimscombe%20%26amp%3B%20Thrupp%20F.C.\"&gt;Brimscombe&lt;/a&gt;, and the club went on to finish the 1894\u201395 season in third place. &lt;a href=\"Nailsworth\"&gt;Nailsworth&lt;/a&gt; had become an &lt;a href=\"Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29\"&gt;urban district&lt;/a&gt; in 1894 and there was an effort to ensure the town was represented by a football team. As a result, the club was renamed Nailsworth Association Football Club and many members of the original team were replaced by players from Nailsworth, although they continued to play at the original &lt;a href=\"the%20Lawn%20Ground\"&gt;Lawn Ground&lt;/a&gt; in Forest Green. However, the club withdrew from the league during the 1896\u201397 season.\nThe club was re-established in 1898 under the Forest Green Rovers name, and absorbed Nailsworth Thursday shortly afterwards. They joined both Division One of the Mid-Gloucestershire League and also the &lt;a href=\"Dursley\"&gt;Dursley&lt;/a&gt; &amp; District League for the 1899\u20131900 season. The Mid-Gloucestershire League folded in 1901, with Forest Green left playing in the Dursley &amp; District League. In 1902\u201303 they joined the new &lt;a href=\"Stroud%20and%20District%20Football%20League\"&gt;Stroud &amp; District League&lt;/a&gt;, also continuing in the Dursley &amp; District League. In the Stroud &amp; District League they finished as runners-up to Brimscombe, whilst in the Dursley &amp; District League they finished joint top of the table with &lt;a href=\"Stonehouse%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Stonehouse&lt;/a&gt; after being awarded the points from an unplayed match against Chalford. As a result, a play-off match was held to decide the championship, with over 1,000 spectators watching Forest Green win 2\u20131 in extra time. In 1906\u201307 they finished bottom of the Stroud &amp; District League with zero points (although they had won one game, they had two points deducted for fielding an ineligible player). They withdrew from the Dursley &amp; District League in 1908.\nIn 1911 Forest Green merged with Nailsworth to form Nailsworth &amp; Forest Green United, continuing to play at &lt;a href=\"the%20Lawn%20Ground\"&gt;the Lawn Ground&lt;/a&gt; and in the Stroud &amp; District League; the new club won the league, losing only one match all season. They entered a team into the Dursley &amp; District League in 1912\u201313, but withdrew from the Stroud &amp; District League after only four matches. After &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; the club rejoined the league and the 1919\u201320 season saw them finish joint top of the table with Chalford and Stonehouse. The league subsequently held a draw to decide the championship, with Forest Green drawn against Stonehouse in a semi-final, with the winner to play Chalford for the title. However, Stonehouse beat Forest Green 3\u20132 in the semi-final match. In 1920 the club also entered a team into the North Gloucestershire League and went on to win both leagues, as well as the Northern Junior Cup. They repeated the double league championship the following season. They were founder members of the &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire%20Northern%20Senior%20League\"&gt;Gloucestershire Northern Senior League&lt;/a&gt; in 1922, but left the league at the end of the 1922\u201323 season to return to the Stroud &amp; District League.\nForest Green finished as runners-up in 1924\u201325 and 1925\u201326, before rejoining the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League in 1926. They went on to finish as runners-up in 1926\u201327 before leaving the league again to play in the new Stroud Premier League. After finishing fourth in the league, the club returned to the Northern Senior League at the end of the season, although they also kept a team in the Stroud Premier League. The club withdrew from the Stroud Premier League in 1930, the league for a third time in 1934, rejoining the Stroud Premier League. They were Stroud Premier League champions for three successive seasons in 1934\u201335, 1935\u201336 and 1936\u201337, before re-entering the Northern Senior League in 1937. They went on to win the league title in 1937\u201338. After finishing as runners-up in 1948\u201349, they won successive league titles in 1949\u201350 and 1950\u201351. Although the club finished as runners-up in 1952\u201353, they were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1954\u201355 season. However, they were Division Two champions the following season, and were promoted back to Division One. Forest Green were amongst the founders of the &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire%20County%20Football%20League\"&gt;Gloucestershire County League&lt;/a&gt; in 1968, where they played until moving up to the Premier Division of the &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Football%20League\"&gt;Hellenic League&lt;/a&gt; in 1975 under the management of &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Goring\"&gt;Peter Goring&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegional leagues.\nForest Green's &lt;a href=\"1975%E2%80%9376%20Hellenic%20Football%20League\"&gt;first season&lt;/a&gt; in the Hellenic League Premier Division saw them finish fourth. Although they then spent two seasons in lower mid-table, a third-place finish in &lt;a href=\"1978%E2%80%9379%20Hellenic%20Football%20League\"&gt;1978\u201379&lt;/a&gt; was the start of a successful four years, culminating in the &lt;a href=\"1981%E2%80%9382%20Hellenic%20Football%20League\"&gt;1981\u201382 season&lt;/a&gt;, in which they won the Hellenic League and reached the final of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Vase\"&gt;FA Vase&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt; they defeated &lt;a href=\"Rainworth%20Miners%20Welfare%20F.C.\"&gt;Rainworth Miners Welfare&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 to win the trophy. At the end of the season the club were promoted to the Midland Division of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt;. Although they finished third in their &lt;a href=\"1982%E2%80%9383%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;first season&lt;/a&gt; in the new league, the next six seasons were spent in mid-table.\nIn 1989, the club was renamed Stroud Football Club. &lt;a href=\"1989%E2%80%9390%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Another season&lt;/a&gt; in mid-table was followed by two in which they finished in the bottom five. After reverting to their original name, the club continued to struggle in the league until they were transferred to the Southern Division in 1995. After finishing eighth under Frank Gregan in &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;1995\u201396&lt;/a&gt;, they won the division the &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt;, earning promotion to the Premier Division of the Southern League. The &lt;a href=\"1997%E2%80%9398%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;1997\u201398 season&lt;/a&gt; saw them win the Southern League Premier Division, securing a second successive promotion and entry to the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20%28English%20football%29\"&gt;Football Conference&lt;/a&gt;.\nConference and Football League.\nIn Forest Green's &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;first season&lt;/a&gt; in the Conference they finished twelfth, as well as reaching the final of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Trophy\"&gt;FA Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first team to play in the final of both the FA Vase and the FA Trophy. However, they lost 1\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Kingstonian%20F.C.\"&gt;Kingstonian&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;following&lt;/a&gt; season saw another first as the club reached the first round of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the first time; after beating &lt;a href=\"Guiseley%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Guiseley&lt;/a&gt; 6\u20130 in the first round, they lost 3\u20130 at home to &lt;a href=\"Torquay%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Torquay United&lt;/a&gt; in the second. In November 2000 Gregan was replaced as manager by former England international &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Spink\"&gt;Nigel Spink&lt;/a&gt;; the club reached the FA Trophy final again at the end of the season, losing 1\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Canvey%20Island%20F.C.\"&gt;Canvey Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2004\u201305&lt;/a&gt; Forest Green finished in the relegation zone, but were reprieved after &lt;a href=\"Northwich%20Victoria%20F.C.\"&gt;Northwich Victoria&lt;/a&gt; were demoted due to issues with their stadium. In &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;2007\u201308&lt;/a&gt; the club defeated Football League opposition in the FA Cup for the first time, beating &lt;a href=\"Rotherham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Rotherham United&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 in a first round replay, before losing 3\u20132 at &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt; saw them reach the third round of the Cup for the first time, beating &lt;a href=\"Team%20Bath%20F.C.\"&gt;Team Bath&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Rochdale%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Rochdale&lt;/a&gt; to set a third round tie at home to &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt; which they lost 4\u20133 in front of a record crowd of 4,836. Another third round appearance in &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;2009\u201310&lt;/a&gt; ended with a 2\u20131 defeat at &lt;a href=\"Notts%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Notts County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2009\u201310&lt;/a&gt; season saw Forest Green finish in the relegation zone, but another reprieve from relegation was won when &lt;a href=\"Salisbury%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Salisbury City&lt;/a&gt; were expelled for breaking financial rules. The club was then taken over by &lt;a href=\"Ecotricity\"&gt;Ecotricity&lt;/a&gt; owner &lt;a href=\"Dale%20Vince\"&gt;Dale Vince&lt;/a&gt;; Vince set out plans to make the club more eco-friendly, including removing red meat from players' diets, stopping selling meat products in the ground and treating the pitch with organic fertiliser.\nForest Green finished fifth in the Conference in &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2014\u201315&lt;/a&gt;, qualifying for the promotion play-offs; they went on to lose 3\u20130 on aggregate to &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol Rovers&lt;/a&gt; in the semi-finals. The &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20National%20League\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt; saw them finish as runners-up in the renamed National League, their highest-ever league position; in the subsequent play-offs they defeated &lt;a href=\"Dover%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Dover Athletic&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 in the semi-finals, before losing 3\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Grimsby Town&lt;/a&gt; in the final at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt;. A third consecutive play-off campaign was secured with a third-place finish in &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20National%20League\"&gt;2016\u201317&lt;/a&gt;. After beating &lt;a href=\"Dagenham%20%26amp%3B%20Redbridge%20F.C.\"&gt;Dagenham &amp; Redbridge&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131 in the semi-finals, the club defeated &lt;a href=\"Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Tranmere Rovers&lt;/a&gt; by the same scoreline in the final at Wembley, earning promotion to &lt;a href=\"EFL%20League%20Two\"&gt;League Two&lt;/a&gt;. This made Nailsworth the smallest town ever to host a Football League club.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Forest%20Green%20Rovers%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt; Forest Green Rovers became the first football club in the world to be certified &lt;a href=\"Carbon%20neutrality\"&gt;carbon neutral&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change\"&gt;United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (UNFCCC) initiative &lt;a href=\"Climate%20Neutral%20Now\"&gt;Climate Neutral Now&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20EFL%20League%20Two\"&gt;2018\u201319 season&lt;/a&gt; saw them finish fifth in League Two. They went on to lose 2\u20131 to Tranmere in the play-off semi-finals.\nAnother play-off campaign in &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Forest%20Green%20Rovers%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2020-21&lt;/a&gt; saw them lose 5-4 on aggregate to &lt;a href=\"Newport%20County%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Newport County&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreen credentials.\nThe United Nations has recognised Forest Green Rovers as the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral football club and it was described by &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; as the \u201cgreenest team in the world\u201d.\nIn September 2020, &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; fullback &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A9ctor%20Beller%C3%ADn\"&gt;H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; became the second-largest shareholder in the club.\nOn 2 August 2021, Forest Green Rovers announced a new partnership with clean energy and electric vehicle YouTube channel, Fully Charged and named their pitch accordingly to The Fully Charged New Lawn.\nColours and crest.\nThe previous club badge was very similar to the &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; badge. The flag of St. George appeared on both badges, showing his links to England as well as &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalonia&lt;/a&gt;. Rovers' home kit for many years was a black and white striped shirt with black shorts.\nIn May 2011, the club released a consultation for supporters inviting opinions on the club's decision to change its badge. The new badge was used from the beginning of the 2011\u20132012 season.\nOn 2 July 2012, it was announced that the club would change its home strip from its traditional black and white stripes to a lime green shirt with black shorts and socks. The decision to move away from the traditional black and white stripes proved controversial with many supporters. The away strip was also changed to an all-white kit with the dates '1899\u20132012' near the neckline of the kit to indicate the years when the club first played in an all-white kit and the decision to bring it back in 2012.\nIn the summer of 2014 the home strip was changed to lime green and black stripes on the front, with a plain green back, green shorts and black and green striped socks in order to align with sponsor Ecotricity's marketing colours. On 19 August 2014, the new away strip was announced, which would be a modern version of the traditional home strip of black and white striped shirt, black shorts and red socks.\nIn 2021, the team became the first in the world to play in a football kit made from a composite material consisting of recycled plastic and coffee grounds.\nRivalries.\n&lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire\"&gt;Gloucestershire&lt;/a&gt; rivals &lt;a href=\"Cheltenham%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Cheltenham Town&lt;/a&gt; are seen as the club's main rivals. Fixtures between the two sides are humorously named \"El Glosico\", a &lt;a href=\"play-on-words\"&gt;play-on-words&lt;/a&gt; of the famous \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Cl%C3%A1sico\"&gt;El Cl\u00e1sico&lt;/a&gt;\" fixture.\nDuring the club's years in the non-league pyramid, the club maintained local rivalries with &lt;a href=\"Gloucester%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Gloucester City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bath%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Bath City&lt;/a&gt;. However, following Rovers' promotion to the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;EFL&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, these rivalries are no longer competed.\nSmaller rivalries have since developed with &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol Rovers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newport%20County%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Newport County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt;.\nStadium.\nThe club initially played at a ground 'at the top of the hill' in Forest Green known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Lawn%20Ground\"&gt;the Lawn Ground&lt;/a&gt;. They moved to a ground in Nailsworth in 1924, but returned to the Lawn in 1927 after it was upgraded with a boundary wall and entrance gates. At the start of the &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2006\u201307 season&lt;/a&gt; the club moved to &lt;a href=\"the%20New%20Lawn\"&gt;the New Lawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sustainability in Sport terrace is at the north end of the ground. This terrace is the location for away fans and had previously housed home supporters. A decision by the club at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2012-13%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2012\u201313&lt;/a&gt; season saw the areas in which home and away fans were housed at the ground switched with home fans reverting to the EESI Stand at the opposite end of the ground which was converted from seating to a standing terrace. The East Stand is the largest-capacity stand at the ground and is a seated stand that contains seven boxes, the 'Green Man' public house, gym, dance studio and conference and leisure facilities. The western side of the ground is an open terrace available to home fans. Although the stadium can hold 5,147 fans, the highest league attendance recorded at the venue so far was 3,781 in a &lt;a href=\"Conference%20Premier\"&gt;Conference Premier&lt;/a&gt; fixture against &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol Rovers&lt;/a&gt;. However, the highest all-time attendance was 4,836 for an &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; third round tie at home to Championship side &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt;. The usual attendance was between 1,300 and 1,800 for National League fixtures.\nIn June 2011, the club began work on making the stadium environmentally friendly following the arrival of new owner and green energy entrepreneur &lt;a href=\"Dale%20Vince\"&gt;Dale Vince&lt;/a&gt;. This included developing an entirely organic pitch. In December 2011, 180 solar panels were installed on the roof of the EESI stand, helping the club generate 10% of the electricity needed to run the stadium. In April 2012, Forest Green introduced the first robot lawn mower to be used by a British football club on to its playing surface. This followed a previous robot mower that had been in service at the club's former ground. The Etesia robot mower\u00a0\u2013 known as a 'mow bot'\u00a0\u2013 uses GPS technology to guide it round the pitch without the need for human intervention and gathers power from the solar panels at the stadium. In December 2012, the club beat 200 other nominees to first prize in the Institute of Groundsmanship awards in the sustainability and environmental category for its organic pitch and the environmental aspects at The New Lawn.\nOn 3 November 2016, the club announced the winning design for a proposed 5,000 seat new stadium to be built within the Eco Park complex beside Junction 13 of the M5 in Gloucestershire, 1.5 miles west of the town of &lt;a href=\"Stonehouse%2C%20Gloucestershire\"&gt;Stonehouse&lt;/a&gt; (and 8.5 miles northwest of their spiritual home of Nailsworth). The design is for a stadium made almost entirely of wood, including the roof cantilevers. It will be able to be increased in size to 10,000 capacity depending on the club's success.
