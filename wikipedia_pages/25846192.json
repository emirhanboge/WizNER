    "text": "The former Blume High School is a historic building in downtown &lt;a href=\"Wapakoneta%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Wapakoneta, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, United States. Built in 1908 in a mix of architectural styles, it was designed by architects &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Packard\"&gt;Frank Packard&lt;/a&gt; and W.M. Runkle. It was the first exclusive home of &lt;a href=\"Wapakoneta%20High%20School\"&gt;Wapakoneta High School&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to that time, WHS was housed with other grades.\nThe original part of the high school was built at a cost of $41,315. In the mid-1920s, it was expanded with the construction of a &lt;a href=\"gym\"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt;nasium, a &lt;a href=\"library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"Red Brick Section\" addition; while the last portion was built with money raised from &lt;a href=\"Bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt;, the library and gym were financed with a bequest from L.N. Blume.\nGrowth in the &lt;a href=\"Wapakoneta%20City%20School%20District\"&gt;Wapakoneta City School District&lt;/a&gt; resulted in overcrowding by the mid-1950s. After a series of failed attempts, the school board succeeded in winning voter approval for the construction of a new school in 1956, and the new Wapakoneta High School building, which today serves as the Wapakoneta Middle School, opened at the beginning of 1959. Blume was converted into a &lt;a href=\"middle%20school\"&gt;junior high school&lt;/a&gt; for several years, but a 1988 vote resulted in the school's closing by 1990.\nIn 1996, the former Blume High School was listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; because of its architecture."
