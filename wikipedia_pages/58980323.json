    "text": "Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution is a nonfiction political book by &lt;a href=\"Fox%20News\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; host, &lt;a href=\"Tucker%20Carlson\"&gt;Tucker Carlson&lt;/a&gt;. Published by &lt;a href=\"Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster\"&gt;Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/a&gt;, \"Ship of Fools\" was released on October 2, 2018, before that year's &lt;a href=\"2018%20United%20States%20elections\"&gt;midterm elections&lt;/a&gt;, and entered number one on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list\"&gt;Best Seller list&lt;/a&gt;.\nSynopsis.\nCarlson applies &lt;a href=\"Ship%20of%20fools\"&gt;the allegory&lt;/a&gt; given in &lt;a href=\"Plato\"&gt;Plato&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Republic%20%28Plato%29\"&gt;Republic&lt;/a&gt;\" to the modern United States: the American &lt;a href=\"Ship%20of%20State\"&gt;Ship of State&lt;/a&gt; has been commandeered by an incompetent crew (the current political and economic &lt;a href=\"American%20upper%20class\"&gt;elite ruling class&lt;/a&gt;) who are oblivious or contemptuous to the needs of the passengers (the citizens) and intolerant of criticism. He ties this to the idea that the United States is ill-headed by these out-of-touch elites. Carlson does not restrict his definition of the elite to &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; members of &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;, but includes politicians of both the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; parties, &lt;a href=\"Neoconservatism\"&gt;neoconservative&lt;/a&gt; pundits, predominately &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Kristol\"&gt;Bill Kristol&lt;/a&gt;, and modern entrepreneurs, such as &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Zuckerberg\"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Bezos\"&gt;Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt;, who he blames for decimating the &lt;a href=\"American%20middle%20class\"&gt;American middle class&lt;/a&gt;. Quickly summarizing the premise of the book, Carlson has said it simply amounts to: \"Why did &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; get &lt;a href=\"2016%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nReception.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Times\"&gt;The Washington Times&lt;/a&gt;\" praised the book, describing it as \"bulging with big and interesting ideas, presented succinctly with wit and precision, each chapter a potential book in itself. In a sense, it reflects how and why Mr. Carlson\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Tucker%20Carlson%20Tonight\"&gt;television show&lt;/a&gt; is so highly successful \u2014 quick intelligence, precision with words, the rat-a-tat style that today\u2019s television demands.\" President &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, who Carlson describes as \"vulgar and ignorant\" and \"a throbbing middle finger in the face of America's ruling class\" in the book, publicly congratulated Carlson for the book's success.\nMarianna Raymond, Carlson's &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; first-grade teacher at &lt;a href=\"La%20Jolla%20Country%20Day%20School\"&gt;La Jolla Country Day School&lt;/a&gt;, who Carlson writes of loudly crying at her desk and his wish for her to \"stop blubbering and teach us to read,\" was interviewed by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2021 about her inclusion in the book. Raymond, who said Carlson was \"very precious and very, very polite and sweet\" when she knew him, called her inclusion \"the most embellished, crazy thing\" she had ever heard. She claimed she never cried at her desk, never advocated her political views openly, and had actually been hired to tutor Carlson, where he claimed a separate tutor had to be hired."
