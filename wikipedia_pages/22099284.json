    "text": "Malcolm Sathiyanathan Adiseshiah (18 April 1910\u00a0\u2013 21 November 1994), was an Indian development economist and educator. In 1976 he was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Padma%20Bhushan\"&gt;Padma Bhushan&lt;/a&gt;, India's third-highest civilian award. In 1998, &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; created 'The Malcolm Adiseshiah International Literacy Prize' in recognition of his contribution to &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"literacy\"&gt;literacy&lt;/a&gt;. He was nominated to the &lt;a href=\"Rajya%20Sabha\"&gt;Rajya Sabha&lt;/a&gt;, the upper house of the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20India\"&gt;Parliament of India,&lt;/a&gt; in 1978.\nEarly years and education.\nAdiseshiah was born on 18 April 1910 in &lt;a href=\"Vellore\"&gt;Vellore&lt;/a&gt;, southern India. He is the second of the five children of Paul Varanasi Adiseshiah and Grace Nesamma Adiseshiah. His father was a &lt;a href=\"professor\"&gt;professor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; and the first Indian &lt;a href=\"Principal%20%28academia%29\"&gt;principal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Voorhees%20College%20%28India%29\"&gt;Voorhees College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vellore%20district\"&gt;Vellore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; State, India. His mother was a musician who had studied up to the &lt;a href=\"Senior%20Cambridge\"&gt;Senior Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; (High School) and was the first woman Councilor of the &lt;a href=\"Vellore\"&gt;Vellore&lt;/a&gt; Municipality. She taught her five children until they were ten years of age. Malcolm Adiseshiah obtained a doctorate in &lt;a href=\"economics\"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"London%20School%20of%20Economics\"&gt;London School of Economics&lt;/a&gt;, William, the eldest brother, in philosophy at &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, Padmini in &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;, and Noble in &lt;a href=\"medicine\"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdiseshiah studied in &lt;a href=\"Voorhees%20High%20School\"&gt;Voorhees High School&lt;/a&gt;, where he obtained two double promotions. He completed his &lt;a href=\"secondary%20school\"&gt;secondary school&lt;/a&gt; education at the age of thirteen to join Voorhees College for his \u2018intermediate\u2019 course (equivalent to +2 course now.) Then he shifted to &lt;a href=\"Loyola%20College%2C%20Chennai\"&gt;Loyola College, Chennai,&lt;/a&gt; for his BA (Honours), where &lt;a href=\"Ramaswamy%20Venkataraman\"&gt;Ramaswamy Venkataraman&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20India\"&gt;President of India&lt;/a&gt;, was his classmate. After a six-year teaching &lt;a href=\"interregnum\"&gt;interregnum&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral%20Mission%20College\"&gt;St. Paul's Cathedral Mission College&lt;/a&gt; in Calcutta (now &lt;a href=\"Kolkata\"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt;), he proceeded to &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;King's College, Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, for his &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Arts\"&gt;MA&lt;/a&gt; (Banking) and then to the London School of Economics (1937\u201340) for pursuing his doctoral research with specialization in &lt;a href=\"currency\"&gt;currency&lt;/a&gt;. Late Dr. R. N. Poduval, who served in FAO and then was Chairman of Centre for Research in Economic and Social Development, Chennai, was two years his junior in LSE.\nIn later life, after his retirement from UNESCO, Adiseshiah recalled his training and research;\nTeaching career.\nIn 1930 Adiseshiah joined as a lecturer in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral%20Mission%20College\"&gt;St. Paul's Cathedral Mission College&lt;/a&gt;, an affiliate of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Calcutta\"&gt;University of Calcutta,&lt;/a&gt; and continued until 1936. He worked on planning a rural service program in the college in cooperation with the &lt;a href=\"Visva-Bharati%20University\"&gt;Visva-Bharati University&lt;/a&gt; associates at &lt;a href=\"Sriniketan\"&gt;Sriniketan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santiniketan\"&gt;Santiniketan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1940, after obtaining his &lt;a href=\"doctorate\"&gt;doctorate&lt;/a&gt; at the age of thirty, he joined &lt;a href=\"Madras%20Christian%20College\"&gt;Madras Christian College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chennai\"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt;, as its first &lt;a href=\"professor\"&gt;professor&lt;/a&gt; and head of the &lt;a href=\"economics\"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt; department. His role and support for the British government in the notorious and deadly Bengal famines of 1940s is controversial. He remained there until 1946. Prof. K. N. Raj, founder of Centre for Developmental Studies, Tiruvananthapuram, and G. Jagathpathy, former Chief Secretary of the government of &lt;a href=\"Madhya%20Pradesh\"&gt;Madhya Pradesh,&lt;/a&gt; were his students in the 1941-44 batch of BA Honours course. Raj recalled this experience:\nHis publications in the 1940s included books on &lt;a href=\"banking\"&gt;banking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rural%20development\"&gt;rural development&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"agricultural\"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt; transformation. He was engaged, with his fellow economists in the Madras University, in work on planning the future &lt;a href=\"industrialization\"&gt;industrialization&lt;/a&gt; of India and Madras State.\nPersonal life.\nAdiseshiah married Helen Paranjothi, with whom he had a son and a daughter. The separation process with Helen Paranjothi started in 1946, and the &lt;a href=\"annulment\"&gt;annulment&lt;/a&gt; of the marriage came in 1956. Adiseshiah then married Elizabeth Pothen, a history professor he met at the Madras Women\u2019s Christian College.\nUNESCO and UN service.\nFrom 1946 to 1948, Adiseshiah served as Associate General Secretary of the World University Service in &lt;a href=\"Geneva\"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt;. This association later helped him to support steps for the construction of the World University Service Centre in &lt;a href=\"Chennai\"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt; and women\u2019s &lt;a href=\"hostel\"&gt;hostel&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Delhi\"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rajasthan\"&gt;Rajasthan&lt;/a&gt;. During that period, he was also connected with the &lt;a href=\"World%20Student%20Christian%20Federation\"&gt;World Student Christian Federation&lt;/a&gt; and Student Volunteer Service.\nFrom 1 to 16 November 1945, a &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Conference was convened in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to establish of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF). In the conference, a new organization was created to establish the \u201cintellectual and moral solidarity of mankind\u201d and thus prevent the outbreak of another &lt;a href=\"world%20war\"&gt;world war&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Educational%2C%20Scientific%20and%20Cultural%20Organization\"&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization&lt;/a&gt; (UNESCO) was founded by thirty-seven countries. Its Constitution to promote collaboration between member states in the fields of &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"culture\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; was signed on 16 November 1945 and came into force on 4 November 1946. &lt;a href=\"Sarvepalli%20Radhakrishnan\"&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20India\"&gt;President of India&lt;/a&gt;, was a former student of Adiseshiah\u2019s father. He made a referral to Sir &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Huxley\"&gt;Julian Huxley&lt;/a&gt;, then Director-General of UNESCO, who invited Adiseshiah to the organization in 1948. He was posted as Deputy Director of the department of exchange of persons. In that capacity, Adiseshiah signed the UNESCO Fellowship letter in 1949 to &lt;a href=\"M.%20S.%20Swaminathan\"&gt;M. S. Swaminathan&lt;/a&gt;, eminent scientist, and administrator, to pursue research at the Agricultural University in &lt;a href=\"Wageningen\"&gt;Wageningen&lt;/a&gt;, the Netherlands, which was the starting point illustrious career.\nIn March 1950, Adiseshiah was promoted to the Director of &lt;a href=\"technical%20assistance\"&gt;technical assistance&lt;/a&gt; department, and he was one of its six top executives. Adiseshiah was authorized to represent the Director-General at the technical assistance board set up by the UN.\n&lt;a href=\"Rene%20Ochs\"&gt;Rene Ochs&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow member of staff, who later rose to be a Director at UNESCO, wrote about this period:\nUNESCO's tentative proposals were submitted for Technical Assistance for Economic Development in 1950-51. Adiseshiah organized the new department, established area desks corresponding to UN &lt;a href=\"geographical%20region\"&gt;geographical region&lt;/a&gt;s, instituted the procedures and methods of operation, and set up a \u2018report and information unit\u2019 which periodically produced a technical assistance bulletin.\nIn 1955, he was promoted as one among the three Assistant Directors General of UNESCO and put in charge of development.\nThe third stage of UNESCO\u2019s activities dates from the early sixties, when many &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n countries became independent and joined it. In 1962, he was promoted to the post of Deputy Director-General of UNESCO. Then he was the sole incumbent to that office. The UNESCO began organizing important regional conferences of ministers of education or ministers of sciences along with &lt;a href=\"economic%20development\"&gt;economic development&lt;/a&gt; ministries. The first Asian Ministers of Education Conference was held in &lt;a href=\"Karachi\"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt; in 1959 and the first conference for Africa in &lt;a href=\"Addis%20Ababa\"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt; in 1960.\nIn 1991, Sylvain Lourie, Assistant Director General of UNESCO, wrote:\nAdiseshiah was responsible for developing the Karachi Plan for Universal Primary Education for Asia, the &lt;a href=\"Addis%20Ababa\"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santiago%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt; plans for the African and &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;n educational development, and the corresponding science plans for &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, and Latin America. He worked with David Owen, Executive Chairman of the Technical Assistance Board, to convince donor countries since the financing of the expanded program rested on voluntary contributions made by them at pledging conferences. In the need of additional sources, he established relations with the &lt;a href=\"International%20Development%20Association\"&gt;International Development Association&lt;/a&gt; (IDA), &lt;a href=\"Inter-American%20Development%20Bank\"&gt;Inter-American Development Bank,&lt;/a&gt; and other regional &lt;a href=\"Multilateral%20Development%20Bank\"&gt;development bank&lt;/a&gt;s. In 1962 UNESCO approached the &lt;a href=\"World%20Bank\"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, also known as &lt;a href=\"International%20Bank%20for%20Reconstruction%20and%20Development\"&gt;International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&lt;/a&gt; (IBRD), for medium &lt;a href=\"trade%20credit\"&gt;trade credit&lt;/a&gt; for funding a project in &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;. The IBRD, until then, was concentrating on investments in physical capital. Adiseshiah contributed to the persuasion to shift IBRD\u2019s focus exclusively from the expansion of physical capital towards the development of &lt;a href=\"human%20capital\"&gt;human capital&lt;/a&gt;, especially the extension of education. In 1964 he participated in negotiating the memorandum of understanding between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and UNESCO. He introduced flexibility in utilizing &lt;a href=\"multilateral%20aid\"&gt;multilateral aid&lt;/a&gt;. Adiseshiah used a substantial part of &lt;a href=\"USSR\"&gt;USSR's&lt;/a&gt; contribution for technical assistance to establish &lt;a href=\"IIT%2C%20Mumbai\"&gt;IIT, Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;. The expanded technical assistance program was merged with the United Nations Special Fund to form the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Development%20Programme\"&gt;United Nations Development Programme&lt;/a&gt; (UNDP), which was launched in 1966. He formulated a program of technical and financial assistance in each country, which he started with a global outlay of $3 million per annum in 1950. When he retired from the organization, the outlay had increased to $300 million.\nAdiseshiah said:\nAdiseshiah kindled efficiency by arousing &lt;a href=\"team%20spirit\"&gt;team spirit&lt;/a&gt;. He had mastered the art of training a team to fulfill the aspirations of the mission. He made two rounds of &lt;a href=\"round%20the%20world%20trip\"&gt;round the world trip&lt;/a&gt;s each year which took him to as many as twenty-five countries in succession. He organized more than 120 projects in various countries for their economic and &lt;a href=\"Social%20change\"&gt;social development&lt;/a&gt; through education, science, and culture.\nAdiseshiah visited the hundred and twenty-seven &lt;a href=\"member%20states%20of%20the%20UN\"&gt;member states of the UN&lt;/a&gt; several times. He visited each one of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20World\"&gt;Third World&lt;/a&gt; countries that were becoming a member of the UNESCO, studied its economic situation first hand, assessed its need for literacy and education, and made recommendations as to how those needs could be met in the \u2018Mission Reports.\u2019 Each of the \u2018Mission Reports\u2019 was reported to be pioneering contributions about the specific regions on which the reports focused on the emerging discipline of development economics.\nIn 1970 the then Director-General, &lt;a href=\"Rene%20Maheu\"&gt;Rene Maheu&lt;/a&gt;, was reluctant to let him retire. Adiseshiah insisted on leaving. Rene Maheu obtained the sanction of the Executive Board of UNESCO to replace Adiseshiah with two Deputy Director-Generals.\nThere are in the UNESCO archives 118 Adiseshiah files covering approximately 48,000 pages.\nAs a UNESCO official, he rendered assistance to Indian projects. The publication of the UNESCO Art Album on &lt;a href=\"Ajanta%20Caves\"&gt;Ajantha&lt;/a&gt; was mainly due to his &lt;a href=\"yeomen\"&gt;yeomen&lt;/a&gt; efforts. It was due to his vision that the &lt;a href=\"heritage%20site\"&gt;heritage site&lt;/a&gt;s of humankind must be preserved for all posterity.\nUNESCO assisted in the setting up of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Council%20of%20Educational%20Research%20and%20Training\"&gt;National Council of Educational Research and Training&lt;/a&gt; (NCERT), &lt;a href=\"New%20Delhi\"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;: the establishment of first TV broadcasts in India; the reorganization of &lt;a href=\"Films%20Division%20of%20India\"&gt;Films Division of India&lt;/a&gt;; the provision of twenty renowned Professors of engineering and science; the supply of $12 million worth of equipment to IITs of Bombay and Kharagpur; the expansion of aeronautical engineering in &lt;a href=\"Madras%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Madras Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;; and the provision of experts and equipment to &lt;a href=\"Alagappa%20Chettiar%20College%20of%20Engineering%20and%20Technology\"&gt;Alagappa Chettiar College of Engineering and Technology&lt;/a&gt; in Madras (now Chennai), &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was instrumental in rendering such assistance to all member nations of UNESCO, emphasizing to Asian, African, and South American countries.\nAfter his retirement from UNESCO until 1991, he had visited countries of Africa, Latin America, and Asia at their invitation three times a year to advise them on their development plans.\nIn January 1981, Adiseshiah was elected Chairman of the Governing Board of the &lt;a href=\"UNESCO%20International%20Institute%20for%20Educational%20Planning\"&gt;UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning&lt;/a&gt; (IIEP) for a five-year period. In 1986 he was re-elected for a second term for five years. In 1987, 1991, and 1992 he was the Chairman of the jury for the selection of the international literacy prize winners. In 1989 he delivered the Presidential Address at the &lt;a href=\"International%20Literacy%20Day\"&gt;World Literacy Day&lt;/a&gt; function in Paris.\nAdiseshiah was a member of the UN International Committee of Consultants on Environment. He was the co-coordinator of the UNESCO Working Group on the &lt;a href=\"New%20International%20Economic%20Order\"&gt;New International Economic Order&lt;/a&gt;. He reviewed India\u2019s experience with the UN during the first forty years of its existence in an assessment of the role of the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and &lt;a href=\"International%20Monetary%20Fund\"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; (IMF) and the powerful interests working behind the scenes in shaping their policies in a book which he edited.\nMIDS.\nIn September 1970, Adiseshiah and his wife Elizabeth registered in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"trust%20fund\"&gt;trust fund&lt;/a&gt; for starting &lt;a href=\"Madras%20Institute%20of%20Development%20Studies\"&gt;Madras Institute of Development Studies&lt;/a&gt; (MIDS hereafter). MIDS was conceived to undertake studies and research on developmental issues on the economy, polity, and society with particular reference to &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; state. MIDS started functioning in January 1971 in one of their properties in Gandhinagar, Adyar, a Chennai suburb. Adiseshiah was its first Director. Adiseshiah started publishing the publishing of \u2018Bulletin\u00a0\u2013 Madras Development Seminar Series\u2019 in February 1971 and wrote its editorials every month from February 1971, covering international, national, and Tamil Nadu issues until his death. \u2018This surely\u2019 wrote Prof.S. Subramanian, in the prolegomena of the special issue of the Bulletin, bought out after his demise, \u2018is the stuff of which archives are made\u201910\nAs Chairman, he evinced a keen interest in all activities of the Institute. The way he conducted the meetings of the Governing Council, the meticulous care with which he handled the &lt;a href=\"agenda%20%28meeting%29\"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; items, the intense attention he paid to every detail, the insistence that the &lt;a href=\"minutes\"&gt;minutes&lt;/a&gt; of the meetings should be made available to the members within three days and the concern he had to attract highly qualified faculty to the Institute from all regions of India were all reflections of his exceptional caliber as an institution builder. At the same time, he never interfered in the day-to-day activities of the institute, which were within the administrative province of the Director. The faculty and staff had easy access to him. But they had to finish their business with him as quickly as possible since he would signal his craving to return to his unfinished work the very next moment after their business was heard or resolved!\nAs Dr. Barbara Harris-White of IDC, &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20University\"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; writes,\nIn the early 1990s, he apprehended that the Central and State governments might not fulfill their financial commitments to the Institute to the fullest extent necessary. It made him sad. With his wide contacts, he, who had succeeded in finding resources for UNESCO\u2019s massive technical assistance program, could have easily raised additional resources for the Institute had he solicited for it. But he was reluctant to ask. He, who insisted that all departments of Madras University should combine both teaching and research programs, failed to introduce a teaching program in his institute. Nor was he successful in the construction of &lt;a href=\"Lodging\"&gt;accommodation&lt;/a&gt; for the doctoral scholars of his institute.\nEducationalist.\nHis early teaching career, his &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Chancellor\"&gt;Vice Chancellor&lt;/a&gt;ship of the &lt;a href=\"Madras%20University\"&gt;Madras University,&lt;/a&gt; and his various activities in his entire life had their focal point in &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;. A major part of his &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; service was spent formulating educational programs for the &lt;a href=\"developing%20world\"&gt;developing world&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe General Conference of UNESCO, in its fifteenth session, authorized the publication of a work designed to clarify the basic concepts concerning the contribution of education, science, and culture to develop. In the course of the discussions about the resolution, reference was made to the many speeches of Adiseshiah on related themes delivered in &lt;a href=\"Oxford\"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in 1961; &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, UK, and &lt;a href=\"Tananarive\"&gt;Tananarive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madagascar\"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt; in 1962; &lt;a href=\"Madras\"&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; in 1963; &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, Canada in 1964; &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20DC\"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;, USA in 1968 and many others. He was requested to write a book based on the facts and ideas presented in those speeches about that book, &lt;a href=\"U%20Thant\"&gt;U Thant&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations\"&gt;Secretary-General of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, in his \u2018Foreword\u2019 writes:\nThat was the respect he commanded in the UN as an educationalist of eminence.\nHe undertook a survey of the school education in &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1970s and published an influential &lt;a href=\"report\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. His contributions to the growth dynamics of education are numerous. These include the devising of the &lt;a href=\"curricula\"&gt;curricula&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"primary%20education\"&gt;primary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"secondary%20education\"&gt;secondary education&lt;/a&gt;, vocationalization, preparation of teaching material, the introduction of science and technology at appropriate levels, preparation of &lt;a href=\"syllabi\"&gt;syllabi&lt;/a&gt; for a collegiate education, examination reform, giving a new thrust to the quality, content, direction, and methodology of &lt;a href=\"social%20science\"&gt;social science&lt;/a&gt; research, compilation, and analysis of educational data and financing of education.\nHe was instrumental in setting up the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Social%20Science%20Research%20Council\"&gt;Asian Social Science Research Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Delhi\"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, and was its first President. He was a member of the Central Advisory Board of Education, the Indian National Commission for Co-operation with UNESCO, the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), and the National Council of Teacher Education. The ICSSR requested him to undertake a review of its work and suggest the lines it should develop. His meticulously compiled two-volume report, one on a retrospect and the other on the prospect, had been an influential guide in the development of social science of research in India at that period.\nHe was the Chairman of the panel which reviewed the functioning of the &lt;a href=\"Tata%20Institute%20of%20Social%20Sciences\"&gt;Tata Institute of Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (TISS). &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20University\"&gt;Andhra University&lt;/a&gt; entrusted to him the review of the working of the social science departments at &lt;a href=\"Waltair\"&gt;Waltair&lt;/a&gt;. He chaired the committee set up to recommend the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Teresa%20Women%27s%20University\"&gt;Mother Teresa Women's University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kodaikanal\"&gt;Kodaikanal&lt;/a&gt;, Tamil Nadu.\nNon-formal education.\n&lt;a href=\"Non-formal%20education\"&gt;Non-formal education&lt;/a&gt; to cover the vast multitudes that were denied a chance to join formal educational institutions was attempted in various forms in India. The &lt;a href=\"Farmer\"&gt;Farmer&lt;/a&gt;s Functional Literacy Project of 1967 was among the earliest attempts in India. Adiseshiah founded the &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; Board of Continuing Education in 1976 and took all steps to sustain and advance its activities. He was its President for four terms. He chaired the Non-Formal Education Curriculum Preparation Committee in 1976. When the National Adult Education Programme (NAEP) was launched on 2 October 1978, Adiseshiah, then &lt;a href=\"Vice-Chancellor\"&gt;Vice-Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Madras%20University\"&gt;Madras University&lt;/a&gt; was appointed President of the Indian Adult Education Association. Soon he became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Rajya%20Sabha\"&gt;Rajya Sabha&lt;/a&gt; and used the opportunity to expand the adult education program to cover all parts of the country.\nHe was president of the &lt;a href=\"Viswayuvak%20Kendra\"&gt;Viswayuvak Kendra&lt;/a&gt;. He was a member of the UGC Standing Committee on &lt;a href=\"Adult%20Education\"&gt;Adult Education&lt;/a&gt;. When the country launched the &lt;a href=\"National%20Literacy%20Mission%20Programme\"&gt;National Literacy Mission&lt;/a&gt; on 5 November 1988, Adiseshiah was the natural choice for its leadership. The Mission searched for an alternative agency and a strategy to create a country-wide churning for literacy and created the Bharat Gyan Vigyan Samithi (BGVS) in August 1989 and invited Adiseshiah to be its President. BGVS facilitated the shift of adult education from a government-controlled, government-sponsored program to acquire a status of a mass movement. Adiseshiah had the satisfaction of witnessing the declaration of &lt;a href=\"Ernakulam%20district\"&gt;Ernakulam district&lt;/a&gt; in Kerala as having achieved the status of total literacy on 4 February 1990. The new premises of the State Resources Centre of the Tamil Nadu Board of Continuing Education was named after him and was declared open on his 83rd birthday on 18 April 1992.\nOffer of Governorship.\nLate &lt;a href=\"V.%20R.%20Nedunchezhiyan\"&gt;V. R. Nedunchezhiyan&lt;/a&gt;, who was a &lt;a href=\"cabinet%20minister\"&gt;cabinet minister&lt;/a&gt; in the DMK and AIADMK ministries in &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;, recalled the memorial meeting held in the Centenary Hall of the &lt;a href=\"Madras%20University\"&gt;Madras University&lt;/a&gt; in December 1995 that Adiseshiah refused to accept the offer of a Governorship of a state in 1977. He said that a central cabinet minister asked Adiseshiah\u2019s consent for appointment as &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Goa\"&gt;Governor of Goa&lt;/a&gt;. Adiseshiah immediately refused the offer stating that he was not willing to accept any task which would cause his long separation from his beloved MIDS. After consulting with the then &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20India\"&gt;Prime Minister of India&lt;/a&gt;, the central Cabinet minister offered Adiseshiah the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Governorship of Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;, knowing full well that it was against the prevailing convention that no person born in any state would be appointed Governor of that state.\nAdiseshiah was in a tight corner. He requested a day to make up his mind. The next day, during the morning constitutional along the Marina beach, he asked Nedunchezhian, who was his walk companion for many years, for his opinion about the offer. Nedunchezhian replied that Adiseshiah was always a man of action. The state governor was more a &lt;a href=\"ceremonial%20post\"&gt;ceremonial post&lt;/a&gt; that would only put fetters around his multi-pronged activities. Later in the day, Adiseshiah conveyed to the central cabinet minister that he was not accepting the offer of the Governorship of Tamil Nadu. Nedunchezhian also recalled that it was the only occasion when Adiseshiah consulted him about a \u2018political\u2019 decision in his more than two decades of friendship! Surprisingly, Adiseshiah had sought the opinion of his staff, including his &lt;a href=\"car%20driver\"&gt;car driver&lt;/a&gt;s, whether he should accept the governorship or not!\nParliamentarian.\nAdiseshiah was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in April 1978 for a six-year term as one of the twelve persons under the category of those having special knowledge and practical experience in literature, science, art, and social service. There were rapid changes in the composition of the central government during his term. He eschewed &lt;a href=\"party%20politics\"&gt;party politics&lt;/a&gt;. His erudition and experience were appreciated, and his speeches, mainly on economics and education, were listened to with respect. They were interspersed with homely proverbs and quotations. He urged quick redistribution of land. He recommended the imposition of &lt;a href=\"income%20tax\"&gt;income tax&lt;/a&gt; on rich peasants. He pleaded for a level playing field and opposed special concessions to non-resident Indians when they invested in India. He longed for larger two-way traffic between the Central and State Planning Commissions. He advocated a national energy policy. He opposed the nationalization of sick mills in the &lt;a href=\"private%20sector\"&gt;private sector&lt;/a&gt;. In education, he was opposed to haphazard expansion and steadfastly stood for consolidation. He provided a strong voice for teachers. As a humanist, he was deeply concerned with the reduction of poverty, especially in the rural areas. He showed his courage to dissent when the occasion demanded. He provided an outstanding example of a role model for what a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha should be.\nAuthor.\nAdiseshiah wrote elegant prose, lucid and precise. He was a prolific writer. He edited MIDS Bulletin for twenty-four years. Predictably a very major portion of his writings was on education in all its dimensions\u00a0\u2013 literacy, school and &lt;a href=\"higher%20education\"&gt;higher education&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adult%20education\"&gt;adult education&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20education\"&gt;women's education&lt;/a&gt;, non-formal education, &lt;a href=\"continuing%20education\"&gt;continuing education&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"technical%20education\"&gt;technical education&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"science%20education\"&gt;science education&lt;/a&gt;, university education, research methods, and the like. &lt;a href=\"Social%20science\"&gt;Social science&lt;/a&gt;s commanded a great deal of his attention. But he had a much broader perspective. He had written extensively on the &lt;a href=\"environmental%20policy\"&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt; and edited a book on that theme. He was very concerned about &lt;a href=\"Nuclear%20power\"&gt;nuclear energy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Globalisation\"&gt;Globalization&lt;/a&gt; and the new international economic order drew a lot of his notice. &lt;a href=\"Rural\"&gt;Rural&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"poverty\"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt; and inequality were other of his core topics. Next to education, these occupied his prime attention. &lt;a href=\"Price%20policy\"&gt;Price policy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"foreign%20trade\"&gt;foreign trade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"economic%20planning\"&gt;economic planning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"panchayat%20raj\"&gt;panchayat raj,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brownfield%20land\"&gt;wasteland development&lt;/a&gt; are among the many areas on which he had written. His writings were marked by analytical rigor.\nHe employed all printed media such as &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"report\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Academic%20journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magazine\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"newspaper\"&gt;newspaper&lt;/a&gt;s to carry his message. The final issue of MIDS Bulletin (Vol. XXV No.1, Nov. 1995) contains an incomplete list of his written material, classified into editorials, books, edited books, presidential addresses, convocation addresses, keynote addresses, inaugural addresses, valedictory addresses, journals/magazines, newspaper articles, papers for souvenirs/commemoration volumes /essays /surveys /books and miscellaneous papers /lectures. They cover a total of23 pages! They do not include his many volumes in the &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; archives, the numerous reports of committees and commissions in which he was a member, his writings in the period 1930-48, and most of his writings as &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Chancellor\"&gt;Vice-Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Madras%20University\"&gt;Madras University&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the cause of Tamil and Tamil Nadu.\nAdiseshiah loved &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20people\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt; but was no &lt;a href=\"chauvinist\"&gt;chauvinist&lt;/a&gt;. He was instrumental in obtaining &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; assistance to the translation programs of &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20literature\"&gt;Tamil classics&lt;/a&gt;. \"The Ayodhya canto of the Ramayana, as told by Kamban\" &lt;a href=\"translated\"&gt;translated&lt;/a&gt; from Tamil by C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji), was published in 1961 under UNESCO-sponsored programs and publications. \"The Interior Landscape: love poems from a classical Tamil anthology\" translated by A.K. Ramanujan was published in 1967 under the same program.\nHe encouraged the publication of research articles in Tamil. MIDS brought out, and still brings out, Tamil translations and Tamil books.\nHe brought out the &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt; and Tamil versions of UNESCO\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Academic%20journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; \u2018Courier\u2019.\nHe lent a helping hand to launc of the &lt;a href=\"World%20University%20Centre\"&gt;World University Centre&lt;/a&gt; in Spur Tank Road in &lt;a href=\"Chennai\"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe desired the &lt;a href=\"heritage%20site\"&gt;heritage site&lt;/a&gt;s to be well preserved. So he arranged for UNESCO funding for the renovation of &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Rangam%20Ranganatha\"&gt;Sri Rangam Ranganatha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madurai%20Meenakshi\"&gt;Madurai Meenakshi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thanjavur%20Brahadeeswara\"&gt;Thanjavur Brahadeeswara,&lt;/a&gt; and seven other &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s. He initiated a pioneering research work by a French scholar tracing the history and traditions of the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Rangam\"&gt;Sri Rangam&lt;/a&gt; temple in &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe lent a helping hand in obtaining assistance from UNESCO and the &lt;a href=\"French%20government\"&gt;French government&lt;/a&gt; for organizing the Third World Tamil Conference in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; in 1969. As Acting Director-General of UNESCO, he inaugurated it, delivering his address in three languages, Tamil, English, and French.\nThe speed with which he acted could be gauged from the fact that the General Conference of UNESCO at its session in November 1968 accepted the recommendation of the Second International Conference on Tamil Studies held at Madras on 3-10, January 1968 and authorized the Director-General of UNESCO to assist in the creation of an International Institute of &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Studies\"&gt;Tamil Studies&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Madras\"&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt;. In 1970, his last year at UNESCO, he was satisfied with witnessing the setting up of the Institute at Madras, Tamil Nadu.\nThough it was personally inconvenient for him because he had lost touch with the language during his long vacation in Europe, he still would write articles in Tamil whenever requested to do so. At a function to commemorate his 83rd birthday on 18 April 1992, when the new office premises of the Tamil Nadu Board of Continuing Education was named after him, he gave a stirring speech in chaste Tamil, which was well appreciated.\nHe strove hard to reply in Tamil all letters addressed to him in Tamil.\nOther activities.\nAdiseshiah was President of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Economic%20Association\"&gt;Indian Economic Association&lt;/a&gt; in 1973-74 and presided over the Waltair session of its Annual Conference in 1974. Subsequently, as a past President, he evinced keen interest in putting the association\u2019s finances in sound order. He took steps to advance its publishing record.\nHe was also a member of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Economic%20Society\"&gt;Royal Economic Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was a member of the Governing Body of &lt;a href=\"Centre%20for%20Development%20Studies\"&gt;Centre for Development Studies&lt;/a&gt; (CDS) since 1980 and was its Chairman for six years, 1986-92. Under his chairmanship, the Centre entered into an agreement with the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Fund%20for%20Population%20Activities\"&gt;United Nations Fund for Population Activities&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20India\"&gt;Government of India&lt;/a&gt; for conducting an international training program in population and development.\nAdisehsiah succeeded Prof. Lakdawala as Chairman of the Institute of Social Sciences (ISS) and last presided over the Governing Body meeting on 11 November 1994. It was in the inaugural address to the &lt;a href=\"seminar\"&gt;seminar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Panchayati%20Raj\"&gt;Panchayati Raj&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karnataka\"&gt;Karnataka&lt;/a&gt; in October 1985 at ISS that Adiseshiah made the following often-quoted comment:\nDeath.\nHis life came to a quick end. He was hospitalized for less than a week with &lt;a href=\"kidney\"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"heart\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; ailments. He was conscious till the last day. He died on 21 November 1994, aged 84 years.\nElizabeth Adiseshiah died in 1986, leaving all her property to her husband. In Dr. Adiseshiah\u2019s will, he had bequeathed his valuable residential property to MIDS, and his remaining wealth for setting up Malcolm and Elizabeth Adiseshiah Trust (MEAT) for conducting programs in the broad area of economics\u00a0\u2013 teaching and research, both fundamental and applied.\nIn 1993 and 1994, UNESCO PROSPECTS: Quarterly review of comparative education published a series of profiles of 100 famous educators from around the world. In the company of illustrious intellectuals like &lt;a href=\"Aristotle\"&gt;Aristotle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Confucius\"&gt;Confucius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freud\"&gt;Freud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gramsci\"&gt;Gramsci&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Locke\"&gt;Locke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plato\"&gt;Plato&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rousseu\"&gt;Rousseau&lt;/a&gt;, the list includes seven Indians. They are Malcolm Adiseshiah; &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Aurobindo\"&gt;Sri Aurobindo&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Mohandas%20Karamchand%20Gandhi\"&gt;Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Jiddu%20Krishnamurti\"&gt;Jiddu Krishnamurti&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"J.P.%20Naik\"&gt;J.P. Naik&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Rabindranath%20Tagore\"&gt;Rabindranath Tagore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivekananda\"&gt;Vivekananda&lt;/a&gt;. These articles have subsequently been collected and published under the title \u201cThinkers on Education\u201d in three volumes, edited by Tedesco, Juan Carlos and Morsy, Zaghloul, [Paris, UNESCO; New Delhi, Oxford &amp; IBH Publishing, 1997].\nIn his honour.\nAdiseshiah is remembered for significant awards, prizes, &lt;a href=\"scholarship\"&gt;scholarship&lt;/a&gt;s, and endowed chairs. The annual Malcolm Adiseshiah International Literacy Prize (value US $15,000) was awarded by &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; in 1998.
