    "text": "Tektology (sometimes transliterated as tectology) is a term used by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Bogdanov\"&gt;Alexander Bogdanov&lt;/a&gt; to describe a new universal science that consisted of unifying all social, biological and physical sciences by considering them as systems of relationships and by seeking the organizational principles that underlie all systems. Tektology is now regarded as a precursor of &lt;a href=\"systems%20theory\"&gt;systems theory&lt;/a&gt; and related aspects of &lt;a href=\"synergetics%20%28Fuller%29\"&gt;synergetics&lt;/a&gt;. The word \"tectology\" was developed by &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Haeckel\"&gt;Ernst Haeckel&lt;/a&gt;, but Bogdanov used it for a different purpose.\nOverview.\nHis work \"Tektology: Universal Organization Science\", published in Russia between 1912 and 1917, anticipated many of the ideas that were popularized later by &lt;a href=\"Norbert%20Wiener\"&gt;Norbert Wiener&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cybernetics\"&gt;Cybernetics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20von%20Bertalanffy\"&gt;Ludwig von Bertalanffy&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"General%20Systems%20Theory\"&gt;General Systems Theory&lt;/a&gt;. There are suggestions that both Wiener and von Bertalanffy might have read the German edition of \"Tektology\" which was published in 1928.\nIn \"Sources and Precursors of Bogdanov's Tectology\", James White (1998) acknowledged the intellectual debt of Bogdanov's work on tectology to the ideas of &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Noir%C3%A9\"&gt;Ludwig Noir\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. His work drew on the ideas of Noir\u00e9 who in the 1870s also attempted to construct a monistic system using the principle of conservation of energy as one of its structural elements.\nMore recently, in her 2016 book \"Molecular Red: Theory for the Anthropocene\", McKenzie Wark attempts to establish Bogdanov as a precursor to contemporary &lt;a href=\"Anthropocene\"&gt;Anthropocene&lt;/a&gt; theorists, like &lt;a href=\"Donna%20Haraway\"&gt;Donna Haraway&lt;/a&gt;, by considering Bogdanov's works of fiction as an extension of his general work in Tectology. In this, Wark also considers Tectology as an alternative to the Soviet state philosophy of &lt;a href=\"dialectical%20materialism\"&gt;dialectical materialism&lt;/a&gt;, which may help in describing Lenin's vehement opposition to Tectology in his own \"Materialism and Empirio-Criticism\".\nTectology: Topics.\nAccording to Bogdanov \"the aim of Tectology is the systematization of organized &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;\", through the identification of universal organizational &lt;a href=\"principle\"&gt;principle&lt;/a&gt;s: \"all things are organizational, all \"complexes\" could only be understood through their organizational character.\" Bogdanov considered that any complex should correspond to its environment and adapt to it. A stable and organized complex is greater than the sum of its parts. In Tectology, the term 'stability' refers not to a &lt;a href=\"Stability%20constants%20of%20complexes\"&gt;dynamic stability&lt;/a&gt;, but to the possibility of preserving the complex in the given environment. A 'complex' is not identical to a 'complicated, a hard-to-comprehend, large &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aunit\"&gt;unit&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Tectology, Bogdanov made the first 'modern' attempt to formulate the most general &lt;a href=\"laws%20of%20science\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;. Tectology addressed issues such as &lt;a href=\"holistic\"&gt;holistic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emergence\"&gt;emergent&lt;/a&gt; phenomena and systemic development. Tectology as a constructive science built elements into a functional entity using general laws of organization.\nAccording to his \"empirio-monistic\" principle (1899), he does not recognize differences between &lt;a href=\"observation\"&gt;observation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"perception\"&gt;perception&lt;/a&gt; and thus creates the beginning of a general empirical, trans-disciplinary science of physical organization, as an expedient &lt;a href=\"Henosis\"&gt;unity&lt;/a&gt; and precursor of &lt;a href=\"Systems%20Theory\"&gt;Systems Theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holism\"&gt;Holism&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"whole\" in Tectology, and the laws of its integrity, were derived from biological rather than the physicalistic view of the world. Regarding the three scientific cycles which comprise the basis of Tectology (mathematical, physico-biological, and natural-philosophical), it is from the physico-biological cycle that the central concepts have been taken and universalized.\nThe starting point in Bogdanov's \"Universal Science of Organization - Tectology\" (1913-1922) was that nature has a general, organized character, \"with one set of laws of organization for all objects\". This set of laws also organizes the internal development of the complex units, as implied by &lt;a href=\"Simona%20Poustilnik\"&gt;Simona Poustilnik&lt;/a&gt;'s \"macro-paradigm\", which induces synergistic consequences into an adaptive assembling phenomenon (1995). Bogdanov's visionary view of nature was one of an 'organization' with interconnected systems. Bogdanov's \"Tectology\" outlined the concepts and concerns of &lt;a href=\"Complex%20systems\"&gt;Complexity Theory&lt;/a&gt; a full 50 years in advance of &lt;a href=\"chaos%20theory\"&gt;chaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fractal\"&gt;fractal&lt;/a&gt; mathematics.\nWorks.\nAlexander Bogdanov wrote several works about Tectology:"
