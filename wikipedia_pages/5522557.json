    "text": "Sphenocephalus (from , 'wedge' and 'head') is an extinct genus of &lt;a href=\"ray-finned%20fish\"&gt;ray-finned fish&lt;/a&gt; that lived during the &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous\"&gt;Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt; period. Fossils have been found in England and Italy.\n\"Sphenocephalus\" was about long, with a rather large head, and may have resembled a modern &lt;a href=\"black%20bass\"&gt;black bass&lt;/a&gt; in appearance. It was one of the earliest fish to have the &lt;a href=\"pelvic%20fin\"&gt;pelvic fin&lt;/a&gt;s placed beneath th &lt;a href=\"pectoral%20fin\"&gt;pectoral fin&lt;/a&gt;s, a common feature in modern fish that improves swimming manoeuvrability. Like the modern &lt;a href=\"trout-perch\"&gt;trout-perch&lt;/a&gt;es, it possessed a mixture of modern and primitive features, and it was probably one of the earliest &lt;a href=\"perciform\"&gt;perciform&lt;/a&gt; fish."
