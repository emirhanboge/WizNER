    "text": "Knud Johannes Vogelius Steenstrup (7 September 1842 \u2013 6 May 1913) was a &lt;a href=\"Danish%20people\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"geologist\"&gt;geologist&lt;/a&gt;. He was most noted as an &lt;a href=\"exploration\"&gt;explorer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSteenstrup was born at H\u00f8stemark Mill in Mou Sogn, &lt;a href=\"Jutland\"&gt;Jutland&lt;/a&gt;, Denmark. He was the son of Johan Peter Steenstrup (1814\u201349) and Sinned Claudine Lund (1803\u201363),\nHe was a nephew of &lt;a href=\"zoology\"&gt;zoologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Japetus%20Steenstrup\"&gt;Japetus Steenstrup&lt;/a&gt; (1813-1897).\nSteenstrup took a degree in &lt;a href=\"pharmacy\"&gt;pharmacy&lt;/a&gt; in 1863 and worked as assistant at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Copenhagen\"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Geological%20Museum\"&gt;Geological Museum&lt;/a&gt; from 1866 to 1889. He made in total nine journeys to &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, one of which lasted 2.5 years. He made remarkable collections of Cretaceous and Paleogene plant fossils in central West Greenland, which were later treated by &lt;a href=\"swiss%20people\"&gt;swiss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"botany\"&gt;botanist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20Heer\"&gt;Oswald Heer&lt;/a&gt; (1809\u20131883). Heer initially considered the fossils to be &lt;a href=\"Miocene\"&gt;Miocene&lt;/a&gt; in age.\nSteenstrup proved that the large &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;-rich blocks found by &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Erik%20Nordenski%C3%B6ld\"&gt;A.E. Nordenski\u00f6ld&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Disko%20Island\"&gt;Disko&lt;/a&gt;, and claimed by him to be &lt;a href=\"meteorites\"&gt;meteorites&lt;/a&gt;, were in fact &lt;a href=\"native%20iron\"&gt;native iron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Extrusive\"&gt;extrusions&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt;. This finding made his name well known and he was subsequently made honorary member of the &lt;a href=\"Mineralogical%20Society%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;Mineralogical Society of Great Britain and Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. \nFrom 1889 to his death in 1913, he was state geologist at the &lt;a href=\"Geological%20Survey%20of%20Denmark%20and%20Greenland\"&gt;Geological Survey of Denmark&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, a large proportion of his &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;ic collections were lost when &lt;a href=\"Christiansborg%20Palace%23Second%20Christiansborg\"&gt;Christiansborg Palace&lt;/a&gt; burned in 1884. In his home country, he made pioneering studies of &lt;a href=\"dune\"&gt;dune&lt;/a&gt; morphology.\nSteenstrup was the first chairman of the Danish Geological Society from 1893 to 1898.\nIn 1895, he was made an honorary corresponding member of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Geographical%20Society\"&gt;Royal Geographical Society&lt;/a&gt; in London, \nHe was appointed &lt;a href=\"Honorary%20degree\"&gt;Honorary Doctor&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Copenhagen\"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in 1906. \nFrom 1896 he was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Commission%20for%20Scientific%20Investigations%20in%20Greenland\"&gt;Commission for Scientific Investigations in Greenland&lt;/a&gt; and from 1902 fellow of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Danish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20and%20Letters\"&gt;Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe twin &lt;a href=\"K.J.V.%20Steenstrup%20Glacier\"&gt;K.J.V. Steenstrup Glacier&lt;/a&gt;s (\"K.I.V. Steenstrups Nordre Br\u00e6 &amp; K.I.V. Steenstrups S\u00f8ndre Br\u00e6\") in &lt;a href=\"King%20Christian%20IX%20Land\"&gt;King Christian IX Land&lt;/a&gt;, eastern Greenland, are named after him."
