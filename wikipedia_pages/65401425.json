    "text": "\"Der Erdbeermund\" (in English: \"The Strawberry Mouth\") is a song recorded by &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eurodance\"&gt;Eurodance&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Culture%20Beat\"&gt;Culture Beat&lt;/a&gt;. It was released in 1989 as their debut single from the studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Horizon%20%28Culture%20Beat%20album%29\"&gt;Horizon&lt;/a&gt;\" (1991). Written by &lt;a href=\"Torsten%20Fenslau\"&gt;Torsten Fenslau&lt;/a&gt; with Jens Zimmermann and &lt;a href=\"Nosie%20Katzmann\"&gt;Nosie Katzmann&lt;/a&gt; after words by French poet &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Villon\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Villon&lt;/a&gt;, it features a spoken vocal in German by Jo van Nelsen. It peaked at number 11 on the West German singles chart and number 48 on the &lt;a href=\"Eurochart%20Hot%20100\"&gt;Eurochart Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nDisc jockey and music producer Fenslau, who initially had a desire for becoming an architect, had been working as a DJ at the Frankfurt nightclub &lt;a href=\"Dorian%20Gray%20%28club%29\"&gt;Dorian Gray&lt;/a&gt; for 11 years, when he decided to form Culture Beat with his friends Zimmermann and Peter Zweier. Their first single was \"Der Erdbeermund\". Versions in English and French were also released (titled \"Cherry Lips\" and \"Les l\u00e8vres cerises\", respectively). An instrumental version was also a club hit in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, where it reached number 55.\nCritical reception.\nBill Coleman from \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote about the English version of the song, \"Spacious &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;-based track from Germany soothes with each listen. Big on import, various mixes in domestic release should secure club interest.\" Ernest Hardy from \"&lt;a href=\"Cashbox%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Cashbox&lt;/a&gt;\" commented, \"As if a mad poet stood up on the dancefloor and started sprouting his obsessions. This German concoction (an English vocal version is presented as well) manages to be both very artsy and danceable at the same time. The soft roar of the crowd that opens the track at first sounds like a gust of wind, then there's a soft tinkling set against a drum machine; the ongoing contrast of the mechanical with the soft, the harsh with the pretty is what makes 'Lips' work.\"\nReferences.\n "
