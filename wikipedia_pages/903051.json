    "text": "U.S. Route\u00a0341 (US\u00a0341) is a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways\"&gt;U.S. highway&lt;/a&gt; entirely in the U.S. state of &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. It travels diagonally across southern Georgia (but is signed as north\u2013south) from &lt;a href=\"Brunswick%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2017%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a017&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2025\"&gt;SR\u00a025&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Barnesville%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Barnesville&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a041&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%207\"&gt;SR\u00a07&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2018\"&gt;SR\u00a018&lt;/a&gt;. It is a spur route of US\u00a041 and has two intersections with it: in &lt;a href=\"Perry%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Perry&lt;/a&gt; and at its northern terminus in Barnesville.\nRoute description.\nThe following portions of US\u00a0341 are part of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Highway System&lt;/a&gt;, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense:\nBrunswick to Jesup.\nUS\u00a0341 begins at an &lt;a href=\"Intersection%20%28road%29\"&gt;intersection&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2017%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2025\"&gt;SR\u00a025&lt;/a&gt; (Glynn Avenue) in the southeast corner of the city of Brunswick, a short distance north of the &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Lanier%20Bridge\"&gt;Sidney Lanier Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. US\u00a0341 and its state route companion, &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2027\"&gt;SR\u00a027&lt;/a&gt;, head west along 4th Street, a four-lane undivided street. The highway turns north onto Newcastle Street and passes along the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Brunswick\"&gt;Port of Brunswick&lt;/a&gt;. Newcastle Street becomes two lanes at 1st Avenue; US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 turns west onto Prince Street then north onto Bay Street, which becomes a four-lane divided highway immediately to the south of the intersection. The highway parallels &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%20Southern%20Railway\"&gt;Norfolk Southern Railway&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Brunswick%20District\"&gt;Brunswick District&lt;/a&gt; north between downtown Brunswick to the east and an industrial area along the East River. At the north end of downtown, US\u00a0341 has an oblique intersection with &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2025%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a025&lt;/a&gt; (Newcastle Street), whose companion route is &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2025%20Connector%20%28Brunswick%29\"&gt;SR\u00a025 Connector&lt;/a&gt; (SR\u00a025 Conn.) and which serves as the main street of downtown Brunswick.\nUS\u00a025/US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 continues north along Newcastle Street as a four-lane highway with center turn lane out of the city of Brunswick. The highway has a partial &lt;a href=\"Interchange%20%28road%29\"&gt;interchange&lt;/a&gt; with Norwich Street and its name changes to Norwich Street Extended. The highways cross over the paralleling rail line and have a partial interchange with Ross Road and another road that parallels the railroad. In the unincorporated community of &lt;a href=\"Dock%20Junction%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Dock Junction&lt;/a&gt;, the highways intersect &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20303\"&gt;SR\u00a0303&lt;/a&gt;, which heads east as Community Road and west as Blythe Island Highway. Immediately to the south of the intersection is an acute intersection with &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20303%20Connector%20%28Brunswick%29\"&gt;SR\u00a0303 Conn.&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as a cutoff between US\u00a025/US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 and SR\u00a0303. The highways continue as New Jesup Highway across Yellow Bluff Creek and expand to a six-lane divided highway ahead of their &lt;a href=\"partial%20cloverleaf\"&gt;partial cloverleaf&lt;/a&gt; interchange with &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2095%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;I-95&lt;/a&gt;. US\u00a025/US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 become a four-lane highway with center turn lane again, intersect &lt;a href=\"CSX%20Transportation\"&gt;CSX&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Brunswick%20Subdivision\"&gt;Brunswick Subdivision&lt;/a&gt; at grade, and intersect &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2032\"&gt;SR\u00a032&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2099\"&gt;SR\u00a099&lt;/a&gt; in the hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Sterling%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Sterling&lt;/a&gt;. SR\u00a099 heads east as Grants Ferry Road; SR\u00a032 and SR\u00a099 head west as Harrell Highway.\nUS\u00a025/US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 closely parallels the Norfolk Southern rail line northwest from &lt;a href=\"Glynn%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Glynn County&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Wayne County&lt;/a&gt; and to the city of &lt;a href=\"Jesup%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Jesup&lt;/a&gt;. The three highways enter the city as Cherry Street between their crossing of &lt;a href=\"Penholoway%20Creek\"&gt;Penholoway Creek&lt;/a&gt; and their intersection with &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20301%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a0301&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2023\"&gt;SR\u00a023&lt;/a&gt;; US\u00a025 splits north to join US\u00a0301/SR\u00a023 toward &lt;a href=\"Ludowici%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Ludowici&lt;/a&gt;. Just north of the US\u00a0301/SR\u00a023 intersection, US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 turns north onto Pine Street, a four-lane street with center turn lane that curves northwest and parallels Cherry Street through the city. The highways cross over CSX's &lt;a href=\"Nahunta%20Subdivision\"&gt;Nahunta Subdivision&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Jesup%20%28Amtrak%20station%29\"&gt;Jesup Amtrak station&lt;/a&gt; and the orthogonal intersection of the CSX and Norfolk Southern lines. North of the CSX line, US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 intersects &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2084%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a084&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2038\"&gt;SR\u00a038&lt;/a&gt; (1st Street). The highways have an oblique intersection with &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20169\"&gt;SR\u00a0169&lt;/a&gt; (Lanes Bridge Road) and collects the western end of Cherry Street as it leaves Jesup as Odum Highway. US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 travels through the town of &lt;a href=\"Odum%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Odum&lt;/a&gt; as its Main Street and crosses to the north side of the Norfolk Southern rail line in an S curve at the Wayne\u2013&lt;a href=\"Appling%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Appling&lt;/a&gt; county line.\nJesup to Hawkinsville.\nUS\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 continues west as Golden Isles Parkway. The highway intersects &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20121\"&gt;SR\u00a0121&lt;/a&gt; (Still Street) in the town of &lt;a href=\"Surrency%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Surrency&lt;/a&gt; and crosses Satilla Creek. US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 meets &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%201%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a01&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%204\"&gt;SR\u00a04&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2015\"&gt;SR\u00a015&lt;/a&gt; (Main Street) in the city of &lt;a href=\"Baxley%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Baxley&lt;/a&gt;, through which US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 follows Parker Street. US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 continues northwest into &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Davis%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Jeff Davis County&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Hazlehurst%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Hazlehurst&lt;/a&gt;. The two highways enter along Jarman Street and intersects and travels concurrently with &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a023&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20221%20Truck%20%28Hazlehurst%2C%20Georgia%29\"&gt;US\u00a0221 Truck&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2019\"&gt;SR\u00a019&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20135%20Truck%20%28Hazlehurst%29\"&gt;SR\u00a0135 Truck&lt;/a&gt;. Near the center of town, the six highways meet the northbound lanes of &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20221%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a0221&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20135\"&gt;SR\u00a0135&lt;/a&gt; (Cromartie Street). Northbound US\u00a0221/SR\u00a0135 travels concurrently with US\u00a023/US\u00a0341/SR\u00a019/SR\u00a027 as they curve onto Coffee Street and have an oblique intersection with Tallahassee Street, which heads south as the southbound lanes of US\u00a0221/SR\u00a0135 and north with both directions of those highways. US\u00a023/US\u00a0341/SR\u00a019/SR\u00a027 leaves town as Lumber City Highway.\nThe four highways cross the &lt;a href=\"Ocmulgee%20River\"&gt;Ocmulgee River&lt;/a&gt; just west of its confluence with the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Ocmulgee%20River\"&gt;Little Ocmulgee River&lt;/a&gt; and enter &lt;a href=\"Telfair%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Telfair County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20City%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Lumber City&lt;/a&gt; as Golden Isles Highway. Within the city, SR\u00a019 splits northeast toward &lt;a href=\"Glenwood%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Glenwood&lt;/a&gt; and the other three highways meet the eastern terminus of &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20117\"&gt;SR\u00a0117&lt;/a&gt; (Main Street), then intersect at grade the Norfolk Southern rail line. US\u00a023/US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 enters the city of &lt;a href=\"McRae%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;McRae&lt;/a&gt; as Oak Street; east of downtown, the highways split into a &lt;a href=\"one-way%20pair\"&gt;one-way pair&lt;/a&gt;, Railroad Street northbound and Oak Street southbound. The streets intersect 3rd Avenue, which carries &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20280%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a0280&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20441%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a0441&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2030\"&gt;SR\u00a030&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2031\"&gt;SR\u00a031&lt;/a&gt;, before rejoining and entering the neighboring city of &lt;a href=\"Helena%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Helena&lt;/a&gt;, where US\u00a023/US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 intersects a CSX rail line.\nThe three highways follow McRae Highway when they enter &lt;a href=\"Dodge%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Dodge County&lt;/a&gt;. The highway has a pair of intersections with &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20165\"&gt;SR\u00a0165&lt;/a&gt;, Chauncey\u2013Dublin Highway and Chauncey\u2013Rhine Highway, as it travels through the town of &lt;a href=\"Chauncey%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Chauncey&lt;/a&gt;. On the southern edge of &lt;a href=\"Eastman%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Eastman&lt;/a&gt;, US\u00a023/&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20341%20Business%20%28Eastman%2C%20Georgia%29\"&gt;US\u00a0341 Bus.&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2027%20Business%20%28Eastman%29\"&gt;SR\u00a027 Bus.&lt;/a&gt; (College Street) continue straight parallel to the Norfolk Southern rail line toward the center of town while US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 splits west to bypass the town. US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 intersects &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2087\"&gt;SR\u00a087&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20117\"&gt;SR\u00a0117&lt;/a&gt; (Rhine Highway) south of town and meets the northern terminus of US\u00a0341 Bus./SR\u00a027 Bus. (Hawkinsville Highway) on the west side of town. US\u00a0341/SR\u00a027 becomes Eastman Highway and crosses Mosquito Creek as it enters &lt;a href=\"Pulaski%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Pulaski County&lt;/a&gt; and approaches the city of &lt;a href=\"Hawkinsville%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Hawkinsville&lt;/a&gt;.\nHawkinsville to Barnesville.\nJust east of Hawkinsville, in &lt;a href=\"Hartford%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Hartford&lt;/a&gt;, US\u00a0341 and SR\u00a027 have a four-legged intersection with several highways. The south leg of the intersection is Lower River Road, which carries &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20230\"&gt;SR\u00a0230&lt;/a&gt;. The north leg of the intersection is Cochran Highway, which carries &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20129%20Alternate%20%28Hawkinsville%E2%80%93Macon%2C%20Georgia%29\"&gt;US\u00a0129 Alt.&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2026\"&gt;SR\u00a026&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20112\"&gt;SR\u00a0112&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20257\"&gt;SR\u00a0257&lt;/a&gt;. The seven highways head west along Eastman Highway, whose carriageways split as they approach the Ocmulgee River. The westbound and eastbound roadways enter the city of Hawkinsville along Commerce Street and Broad Street, respectively. Immediately to the west of the river, all of the routes except SR\u00a027 turn south from the westbound roadway onto a one-way street, which joins Broad Street as its westbound lanes. &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20341%20Business%20%28Hawkinsville%2C%20Georgia%29\"&gt;US\u00a0341 Bus.&lt;/a&gt; and SR\u00a027 continue west from the turn along Commerce Street. The six-route concurrency continues to Jackson Street, where US\u00a0129 Alt. reaches its southern terminus. Jackson Street carries &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20129%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a0129&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2011\"&gt;SR\u00a011&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20112\"&gt;SR\u00a0112&lt;/a&gt; to the south and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20129%20Business%20%28Hawkinsville%2C%20Georgia%29\"&gt;US\u00a0129 Bus.&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2011%20Business%20%28Hawkinsville%29\"&gt;SR\u00a011 Bus.&lt;/a&gt; to the north. US\u00a0129/US\u00a0341/SR\u00a011/SR\u00a027/SR\u00a0230/SR\u00a0257 continues west along Broad Street; SR\u00a027 and SR\u00a0257 split southwest onto McCormick Avenue at the west end of downtown.\nSR\u00a0230 continues west along Broad Street while US\u00a0129/US\u00a0341/SR\u00a011 turns north onto an unnamed street. The three highways intersect SR\u00a026 (Commerce Street) and intersect the northern terminus of US\u00a0129 Bus./US\u00a0341 Bus./SR\u00a011 Bus. on the northwestern edge of the city. As the highways leave the Hawkinsville area, US\u00a0129 and its companion &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20247\"&gt;SR\u00a0247&lt;/a&gt; split northwest onto Warner Robins Highway; US\u00a0341 and SR\u00a011 follow Perry Highway toward &lt;a href=\"Houston%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Houston County&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Hayneville%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Hayneville&lt;/a&gt;, the highway meets the eastern terminus of SR\u00a0224 (Larry Walker Parkway), a four-lane divided highway which leads directly to I-75, while US\u00a0341/SR\u00a011 continues northwest toward Perry as a two-lane road. The highway crosses over a Norfolk Southern rail line at &lt;a href=\"Clinchfield%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Clinchfield&lt;/a&gt;, then crosses Big Indian Creek and meets the southern terminus of &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20247%20Spur%20%28Perry%29\"&gt;SR\u00a0247 Spur&lt;/a&gt;. The two highways enter the city of &lt;a href=\"Perry%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Perry&lt;/a&gt; as Main Street. US\u00a0341/SR\u00a011 has an acute intersection with &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20127\"&gt;SR\u00a0127&lt;/a&gt; (Houston Lake Road), with which the highways travel concurrently for five &lt;a href=\"City%20block\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt;. SR\u00a011 diverges from US\u00a0341 onto Meeting Street to join &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a041&lt;/a&gt; to the north; two blocks to the west, US\u00a0341/SR\u00a0127 turns north onto Ball Street and intersects US\u00a041/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%207\"&gt;SR\u00a07&lt;/a&gt; (Commerce Street); the latter route becomes US\u00a0341's companion state highway. US\u00a0341/SR\u00a07 becomes a four-lane divided highway, Sam Nunn Boulevard, at the convergence of Ball Street and Washington Street and meets I-75 at a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20interchange\"&gt;diamond interchange&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthwest of Perry, US\u00a0341/SR\u00a07 reduces to two lanes and closely parallels a Norfolk Southern rail line into &lt;a href=\"Peach%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Peach County&lt;/a&gt;. The highways enter the city of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Valley%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Fort Valley&lt;/a&gt; as Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Just east of downtown, US\u00a0341/SR\u00a07 turns onto Oakland Heights Parkway, which crosses over a second Norfolk Southern rail line before meeting and becoming concurrent with &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2096\"&gt;SR\u00a096&lt;/a&gt; at an acute intersection. The two highways diverge from SR\u00a096 (Vineville Street) at its intersection with &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2049\"&gt;SR\u00a049&lt;/a&gt; (Camellia Boulevard), then intersects a third Norfolk Southern rail line. US\u00a0341/SR\u00a07 intersects &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2049%20Connector%20%28Fort%20Valley%29\"&gt;SR\u00a049 Conn.&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20540\"&gt;SR\u00a0540&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Fall%20Line%20Freeway\"&gt;Fall Line Freeway&lt;/a&gt;) as it leaves Fort Valley shortly before entering &lt;a href=\"Crawford%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Crawford County&lt;/a&gt;. The highways enter the town of &lt;a href=\"Roberta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Roberta&lt;/a&gt; along Dugger Avenue, which meets the eastern terminus of &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%20128\"&gt;SR\u00a0128&lt;/a&gt; (Agency Street). US\u00a0341 also intersects &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2080%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;US\u00a080&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2022\"&gt;SR\u00a022&lt;/a&gt; (Crusselle Street). At the same intersection, US\u00a0341/SR\u00a07 becomes concurrent with &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20State%20Route%2042\"&gt;SR\u00a042&lt;/a&gt;, which follows US\u00a080/SR\u00a022 east to the adjacent community of &lt;a href=\"Knoxville%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Knoxville&lt;/a&gt;. US\u00a0341/SR\u00a07 and SR\u00a042 diverge at the hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Musella%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Musella&lt;/a&gt;.
