    "text": "Thermogravimetric analysis or thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) is a method of &lt;a href=\"thermal%20analysis\"&gt;thermal analysis&lt;/a&gt; in which the &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; of a sample is &lt;a href=\"measurement\"&gt;measured&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"time%20in%20physics\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"temperature\"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; changes. This measurement provides information about physical phenomena, such as &lt;a href=\"phase%20transition\"&gt;phase transition&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"absorption%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;absorption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adsorption\"&gt;adsorption&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"desorption\"&gt;desorption&lt;/a&gt;; as well as chemical phenomena including &lt;a href=\"chemisorption\"&gt;chemisorption&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"thermal%20decomposition\"&gt;thermal decomposition&lt;/a&gt;, and solid-gas reactions (e.g., &lt;a href=\"oxidation\"&gt;oxidation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"redox\"&gt;reduction&lt;/a&gt;).\nThermogravimetric analyser.\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is conducted on an instrument referred to as a thermogravimetric analyser. A thermogravimetric analyser continuously measures mass while the temperature of a sample is changed over time. Mass, temperature, and time are considered base measurements in thermogravimetric analysis while many additional measures may be derived from these three base measurements.\nA typical thermogravimetric analyser consists of a precision balance with a sample pan located inside a furnace with a programmable control temperature. The temperature is generally increased at constant rate (or for some applications the temperature is controlled for a constant mass loss) to incur a thermal reaction. The thermal reaction may occur under a variety of atmospheres including: &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;ambient air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vacuum\"&gt;vacuum&lt;/a&gt;, inert gas, oxidising/reducing gases, corrosive gases, carburising gases, vapours of liquids or \"self-generated atmosphere\"; as well as a variety of &lt;a href=\"pressure\"&gt;pressure&lt;/a&gt;s including: a high vacuum, high pressure, constant pressure, or a controlled pressure.\nThe thermogravimetric data collected from a thermal reaction is compiled into a plot of mass or percentage of initial mass on the y axis versus either temperature or time on the x-axis. This plot, which is often &lt;a href=\"Smoothing\"&gt;smoothed&lt;/a&gt;, is referred to as a TGA &lt;a href=\"curve\"&gt;curve&lt;/a&gt;. The first &lt;a href=\"derivative\"&gt;derivative&lt;/a&gt; of the TGA curve (the DTG curve) may be plotted to determine &lt;a href=\"inflection%20points\"&gt;inflection points&lt;/a&gt; useful for in-depth interpretations as well as &lt;a href=\"differential%20thermal%20analysis\"&gt;differential thermal analysis&lt;/a&gt;.\nA TGA can be used for materials characterisation through analysis of characteristic decomposition patterns. It is an especially useful technique for the study of &lt;a href=\"polymer\"&gt;polymer&lt;/a&gt;ic materials, including &lt;a href=\"thermoplastics\"&gt;thermoplastics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"thermosets\"&gt;thermosets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"elastomers\"&gt;elastomers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"composite%20material\"&gt;composites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plastic%20film\"&gt;plastic film&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fibres\"&gt;fibres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coatings\"&gt;coatings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"paints\"&gt;paints&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fuels\"&gt;fuels&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of TGA.\nThere are three types of thermogravimetry:\nApplications.\nThermal stability.\nTGA can be used to evaluate the &lt;a href=\"thermal%20stability\"&gt;thermal stability&lt;/a&gt; of a material. In a desired temperature range, if a species is thermally stable, there will be no observed mass change. Negligible mass loss corresponds to little or no slope in the TGA trace. TGA also gives the upper use temperature of a material. Beyond this temperature the material will begin to degrade.\nTGA is used in the analysis of polymers. Polymers usually melt before they decompose, thus TGA is mainly used to investigate the thermal stability of polymers. Most polymers melt or degrade before 200\u00a0\u00b0C. However, there is a class of thermally stable polymers that are able to withstand temperatures of at least 300\u00a0\u00b0C in air and 500\u00a0\u00b0C in inert gases without structural changes or strength loss, which can be analysed by TGA.\nOxidation and combustion.\nThe simplest materials characterisation is the residue remaining after a reaction. For example, a combustion reaction could be tested by loading a sample into a thermogravimetric analyser at &lt;a href=\"Standard%20conditions%20for%20temperature%20and%20pressure\"&gt;normal conditions&lt;/a&gt;. The thermogravimetric analyser would cause ion combustion in the sample by heating it beyond its &lt;a href=\"ignition%20temperature\"&gt;ignition temperature&lt;/a&gt;. The resultant TGA curve plotted with the y axis as percentage of initial mass would show the residue at the final point of the curve.\nOxidative mass losses are the most common observable losses in TGA. \nStudying the resistance to oxidation in copper alloys is very important. For example, &lt;a href=\"NASA\"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is conducting research on advanced copper alloys for their possible use in &lt;a href=\"combustion%20engines\"&gt;combustion engines&lt;/a&gt;. However, oxidative degradation can occur in these alloys as copper oxides form in atmospheres that are rich in oxygen. Resistance to oxidation is very important because NASA wants to be able to reuse shuttle materials. TGA can be used to study the static oxidation of materials such as these for practical use.\nCombustion during TG analysis is identifiable by distinct traces made in the TGA thermograms produced. One interesting example occurs with samples of as-produced unpurified &lt;a href=\"carbon%20nanotubes\"&gt;carbon nanotubes&lt;/a&gt; that have a large amount of metal &lt;a href=\"catalyst\"&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt; present. Due to combustion, a TGA trace can deviate from the normal form of a well-behaved function. This phenomenon arises from a rapid temperature change. When the weight and temperature are plotted versus time, a dramatic slope change in the first derivative plot is concurrent with the mass loss of the sample and the sudden increase in temperature seen by the thermocouple. The mass loss could be the result of particles of smoke released from burning caused by inconsistencies in the material itself, beyond the oxidation of carbon due to poorly controlled weight loss.\nDifferent weight losses on the same sample at different points can also be used as a diagnosis of the sample's anisotropy. For instance, sampling the top side and the bottom side of a sample with dispersed particles inside can be useful to detect sedimentation, as thermograms will not overlap but will show a gap between them if the particle distribution is different from side to side.\nThermogravimetric kinetics.\nThermogravimetric kinetics may be explored for insight into the reaction mechanisms of thermal (catalytic or non-catalytic) decomposition involved in the &lt;a href=\"pyrolysis\"&gt;pyrolysis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"combustion\"&gt;combustion&lt;/a&gt; processes of different materials.\nActivation energies of the decomposition process can be calculated using Kissinger method.\nThough a constant heating rate is more common, a constant mass loss rate can illuminate specific reaction kinetics. For example, the kinetic parameters of the carbonisation of polyvinyl butyral were found using a constant mass loss rate of 0.2 wt %/min.\nOperation in combination with other instruments.\nThermogravimetric analysis is often combined with other processes or used in conjunction with other analytical methods. \nFor example, the TGA instrument continuously weighs a sample as it is heated to temperatures of up to 2000\u00a0\u00b0C for coupling with &lt;a href=\"Fourier-transform%20infrared%20spectroscopy\"&gt;Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; (FTIR) and &lt;a href=\"mass%20spectrometry\"&gt;mass spectrometry&lt;/a&gt; gas analysis. As the temperature increases, various components of the sample are decomposed and the weight percentage of each resulting mass change can be measured."
