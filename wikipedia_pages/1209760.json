    "text": "A natural product is a &lt;a href=\"chemical%20compound\"&gt;chemical compound&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"chemical%20substance\"&gt;substance&lt;/a&gt; produced by a living organism\u2014that is, found in &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;. In the broadest sense, natural products include any substance produced by life. Natural products can also be prepared by &lt;a href=\"chemical%20synthesis\"&gt;chemical synthesis&lt;/a&gt; (both &lt;a href=\"semisynthesis\"&gt;semisynthesis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"total%20synthesis\"&gt;total synthesis&lt;/a&gt;) and have played a central role in the development of the field of &lt;a href=\"organic%20chemistry\"&gt;organic chemistry&lt;/a&gt; by providing challenging synthetic targets. The term natural product has also been extended for commercial purposes to refer to cosmetics, dietary supplements, and foods produced from natural sources without added artificial ingredients.\nWithin the field of &lt;a href=\"organic%20chemistry\"&gt;organic chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, the definition of natural products is usually restricted to &lt;a href=\"organic%20compound\"&gt;organic compound&lt;/a&gt;s isolated from natural sources that are produced by the pathways of &lt;a href=\"primary%20metabolite\"&gt;primary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"secondary%20metabolite\"&gt;secondary metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. Within the field of &lt;a href=\"medicinal%20chemistry\"&gt;medicinal chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, the definition is often further restricted to secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites are not essential for survival, but nevertheless provide organisms that produce them an evolutionary advantage. Many secondary metabolites are &lt;a href=\"cytotoxic\"&gt;cytotoxic&lt;/a&gt; and have been selected and optimized through evolution for use as \"chemical warfare\" agents against prey, predators, and competing organisms.\nNatural sources may lead to &lt;a href=\"basic%20research\"&gt;basic research&lt;/a&gt; on potential bioactive components for commercial development as &lt;a href=\"lead%20compound\"&gt;lead compound&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"drug%20discovery\"&gt;drug discovery&lt;/a&gt;. Although natural products have inspired numerous drugs, &lt;a href=\"drug%20development\"&gt;drug development&lt;/a&gt; from natural sources has received declining attention in the 21st century by pharmaceutical companies, partly due to unreliable access and supply, intellectual property, cost, and &lt;a href=\"profit%20%28economics%29\"&gt;profit&lt;/a&gt; concerns, seasonal or environmental variability of composition, and loss of sources due to rising &lt;a href=\"extinction\"&gt;extinction&lt;/a&gt; rates.\nClasses.\nThe broadest definition of natural product is anything that is produced by life, and includes the likes of &lt;a href=\"biotic%20material\"&gt;biotic material&lt;/a&gt;s (e.g. wood, silk), &lt;a href=\"bio-based%20material\"&gt;bio-based material&lt;/a&gt;s (e.g. &lt;a href=\"bioplastic\"&gt;bioplastic&lt;/a&gt;s, cornstarch), &lt;a href=\"bodily%20fluid\"&gt;bodily fluid&lt;/a&gt;s (e.g. milk, plant exudates), and &lt;a href=\"Natural%20material\"&gt;other natural material&lt;/a&gt;s (e.g. soil, coal). A more restrictive definition of a natural product is an organic compound that is synthesized by a living organism. The remainder of this article restricts itself to this more narrow definition.\nNatural products may be classified according to their biological function, biosynthetic pathway, or source. One estimate of the number of natural product molecules is about 326,000.\nFunction.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Albrecht%20Kossel\"&gt;Albrecht Kossel&lt;/a&gt;'s original proposal in 1891, natural products are often divided into two major classes, the primary and secondary metabolites. Primary metabolites have an intrinsic function that is essential to the survival of the organism that produces them. Secondary metabolites in contrast have an extrinsic function that mainly affects other organisms. Secondary metabolites are not essential to survival but do increase the competitiveness of the organism within its environment. Because of their ability to modulate biochemical and &lt;a href=\"signal%20transduction\"&gt;signal transduction&lt;/a&gt; pathways, some secondary metabolites have useful medicinal properties.\nNatural products especially within the field of &lt;a href=\"organic%20chemistry\"&gt;organic chemistry&lt;/a&gt; are often defined as primary and secondary metabolites. A more restrictive definition limiting natural products to secondary metabolites is commonly used within the fields of &lt;a href=\"medicinal%20chemistry\"&gt;medicinal chemistry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pharmacognosy\"&gt;pharmacognosy&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrimary metabolites.\nPrimary metabolites as defined by Kossel are components of basic metabolic pathways that are required for life. They are associated with essential cellular functions such as nutrient assimilation, energy production, and growth/development. They have a wide species distribution that span many &lt;a href=\"phylum\"&gt;phyla&lt;/a&gt; and frequently more than one &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20%28biology%29\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Primary metabolites include carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids which are the basic building blocks of life.\nPrimary metabolites that are involved with energy production include &lt;a href=\"respiratory\"&gt;respiratory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"photosynthetic\"&gt;photosynthetic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"enzyme\"&gt;enzyme&lt;/a&gt;s. Enzymes in turn are composed of &lt;a href=\"amino%20acid\"&gt;amino acid&lt;/a&gt;s and often non-peptidic &lt;a href=\"cofactor%20%28biochemistry%29\"&gt;cofactors&lt;/a&gt; that are essential for enzyme function. The basic structure of cells and of organisms are also composed of primary metabolites. These include cell membranes (e.g. &lt;a href=\"phospholipid\"&gt;phospholipid&lt;/a&gt;s), cell walls (e.g. &lt;a href=\"peptidoglycan\"&gt;peptidoglycan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chitin\"&gt;chitin&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"cytoskeleton\"&gt;cytoskeleton&lt;/a&gt;s (proteins).\nPrimary metabolite enzymatic cofactors include members of the &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20B\"&gt;vitamin B&lt;/a&gt; family. &lt;a href=\"Vitamin%20B1\"&gt;Vitamin B1&lt;/a&gt; as thiamine diphosphate is a coenzyme for &lt;a href=\"pyruvate%20dehydrogenase\"&gt;pyruvate dehydrogenase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2-oxoglutarate%20dehydrogenase\"&gt;2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"transketolase\"&gt;transketolase&lt;/a&gt; which are all involved in carbohydrate metabolism. &lt;a href=\"Vitamin%20B2\"&gt;Vitamin B2&lt;/a&gt; (riboflavin) is a constituent of &lt;a href=\"flavin%20mononucleotide\"&gt;FMN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flavin%20adenine%20dinucleotide\"&gt;FAD&lt;/a&gt; which are necessary for many redox reactions. &lt;a href=\"Vitamin%20B3\"&gt;Vitamin B3&lt;/a&gt; (nicotinic acid or niacin), synthesized from tryptophan is a component of the coenzymes &lt;a href=\"NAD%2B\"&gt;NAD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NADP%2B\"&gt;NADP&lt;/a&gt; which in turn are required for electron transport in the &lt;a href=\"Krebs%20cycle\"&gt;Krebs cycle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oxidative%20phosphorylation\"&gt;oxidative phosphorylation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as many other redox reactions. &lt;a href=\"Vitamin%20B5\"&gt;Vitamin B5&lt;/a&gt; (pantothenic acid) is a constituent of &lt;a href=\"coenzyme%20A\"&gt;coenzyme A&lt;/a&gt;, a basic component of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism as well as the biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides. &lt;a href=\"Vitamin%20B6\"&gt;Vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt; (pyridoxol, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine) as pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate is a cofactor for many enzymes especially transaminases involve in amino acid metabolism. &lt;a href=\"Vitamin%20B12\"&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; (cobalamins) contain a &lt;a href=\"corrin\"&gt;corrin&lt;/a&gt; ring similar in structure to &lt;a href=\"porphyrin\"&gt;porphyrin&lt;/a&gt; and is an essential coenzyme for the catabolism of fatty acids as well for the biosynthesis of &lt;a href=\"methionine\"&gt;methionine&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"DNA\"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RNA\"&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt; which store and transmit &lt;a href=\"genetic%20information\"&gt;genetic information&lt;/a&gt; are composed of nucleic acid primary metabolites.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20messenger%20system\"&gt;First messengers&lt;/a&gt; are signaling molecules that control &lt;a href=\"metabolism\"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cellular%20differentiation\"&gt;cellular differentiation&lt;/a&gt;. These signaling molecules include hormones and growth factors in turn are composed of peptides, &lt;a href=\"biogenic%20amine\"&gt;biogenic amine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"steroid%20hormone\"&gt;steroid hormone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"auxin\"&gt;auxin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gibberellin\"&gt;gibberellin&lt;/a&gt;s etc. These first messengers interact with cellular receptors which are composed of proteins. Cellular receptors in turn activate &lt;a href=\"second%20messenger%20system\"&gt;second messengers&lt;/a&gt; are used to relay the extracellular message to intracellular targets. These signaling molecules include the primary metabolites &lt;a href=\"cyclic%20nucleotide\"&gt;cyclic nucleotide&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"diacyl%20glycerol\"&gt;diacyl glycerol&lt;/a&gt; etc.\nSecondary metabolites.\nSecondary in contrast to primary metabolites are dispensable and not absolutely required for survival. Furthermore, secondary metabolites typically have a narrow species distribution.\nSecondary metabolites have a broad range of functions. These include &lt;a href=\"pheromone\"&gt;pheromone&lt;/a&gt;s that act as social signaling molecules with other individuals of the same species, communication molecules that attract and activate &lt;a href=\"symbiotic\"&gt;symbiotic&lt;/a&gt; organisms, agents that solubilize and transport nutrients (&lt;a href=\"siderophores\"&gt;siderophores&lt;/a&gt; etc.), and competitive weapons (&lt;a href=\"allelochemicals\"&gt;repellants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"venoms\"&gt;venoms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"toxins\"&gt;toxins&lt;/a&gt; etc.) that are used against competitors, prey, and predators. For many other secondary metabolites, the function is unknown. One hypothesis is that they confer a competitive advantage to the organism that produces them. An alternative view is that, in analogy to the &lt;a href=\"immune%20system\"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, these secondary metabolites have no specific function, but having the machinery in place to produce these diverse chemical structures is important and a few secondary metabolites are therefore produced and selected for.\nGeneral structural classes of secondary metabolites include &lt;a href=\"alkaloid\"&gt;alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"phenylpropanoid\"&gt;phenylpropanoid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"polyketide\"&gt;polyketide&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"terpenoid\"&gt;terpenoid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBiosynthesis.\nThe biosynthetic pathways leading to the major classes of natural products are described below.\nCarbohydrates.\n&lt;a href=\"Carbohydrate\"&gt;Carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt;s are an essential energy source for most life forms. In addition, &lt;a href=\"polysaccharide\"&gt;polysaccharide&lt;/a&gt;s formed from simpler carbohydrates are important structural components of many organisms such the &lt;a href=\"cell%20wall\"&gt;cell wall&lt;/a&gt;s of bacteria and plants.\nCarbohydrate are the products of plant &lt;a href=\"photosynthesis\"&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt; and animal &lt;a href=\"gluconeogenesis\"&gt;gluconeogenesis&lt;/a&gt;. Photosynthesis produces initially &lt;a href=\"3-phosphoglyceraldehyde\"&gt;3-phosphoglyceraldehyde&lt;/a&gt;, a three carbon atom containing sugar (a &lt;a href=\"triose\"&gt;triose&lt;/a&gt;). This triose in turn may be converted into &lt;a href=\"glucose\"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; (a six carbon atom containing sugar) or a variety of &lt;a href=\"pentose\"&gt;pentose&lt;/a&gt;s (five carbon atom containing sugars) through the &lt;a href=\"Calvin%20cycle\"&gt;Calvin cycle&lt;/a&gt;. In animals, the three carbon precursors &lt;a href=\"lactic%20acid\"&gt;lactate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"glycerol\"&gt;glycerol&lt;/a&gt; can be converted into &lt;a href=\"pyruvate\"&gt;pyruvate&lt;/a&gt; which in turn can be converted into carbohydrates in the liver.\nFatty acids and polyketides.\nThrough the process of &lt;a href=\"glycolysis\"&gt;glycolysis&lt;/a&gt; sugars are broken down into &lt;a href=\"acetyl-CoA\"&gt;acetyl-CoA&lt;/a&gt;. In an ATP dependent enzymatically catalyzed reaction, acetyl-CoA is carboxylated to form &lt;a href=\"malonyl-CoA\"&gt;malonyl-CoA&lt;/a&gt;. Acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA undergo a &lt;a href=\"Claisen%20condensation\"&gt;Claisen condensation&lt;/a&gt; with lose of carbon dioxide to form &lt;a href=\"acetoacetyl-CoA\"&gt;acetoacetyl-CoA&lt;/a&gt;. Additional condensation reactions produce successively higher molecular weight poly-\u03b2-keto chains which are then converted into other &lt;a href=\"polyketide\"&gt;polyketide&lt;/a&gt;s. The polyketide class of natural products have diverse structures and functions and include &lt;a href=\"prostaglandin\"&gt;prostaglandin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"macrolide%20antibiotic\"&gt;macrolide antibiotic&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOne molecule of acetyl-CoA (the \"starter unit\") and several molecules malonyl-CoA (the \"extender units\") are condensed by &lt;a href=\"fatty%20acid%20synthase\"&gt;fatty acid synthase&lt;/a&gt; to produce &lt;a href=\"fatty%20acid\"&gt;fatty acid&lt;/a&gt;s. Fatty acid are essential components of lipid bilayers that form cell membranes as well as fat energy stores in animals.\nSources.\nNatural products may be extracted from the &lt;a href=\"Cell%20%28biology%29\"&gt;cell&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tissue%20%28biology%29\"&gt;tissue&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"secretion\"&gt;secretion&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"microorganism\"&gt;microorganism&lt;/a&gt;s, plants and animals. A crude (&lt;a href=\"Fractionation\"&gt;unfractionated&lt;/a&gt;) extract from any one of these sources will contain a range of structurally diverse and often novel chemical compounds. Chemical diversity in nature is based on biological diversity, so researchers collect samples from around the world to analyze and evaluate in &lt;a href=\"high-throughput%20screening\"&gt;drug discovery screens&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bioassays\"&gt;bioassays&lt;/a&gt;. This effort to search for biologically active natural products is known as &lt;a href=\"bioprospecting\"&gt;bioprospecting&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Pharmacognosy\"&gt;Pharmacognosy&lt;/a&gt; provides the tools to detect, isolate and identify bioactive natural products that could be developed for medicinal use. When an &lt;a href=\"Active%20ingredient%23Herbal%20medicine\"&gt;\"active principle\"&lt;/a&gt; is isolated from a traditional medicine or other biological material, this is known as a \"hit\". Subsequent scientific and legal work is then performed to validate the hit (eg. elucidation of &lt;a href=\"mechanism%20of%20action\"&gt;mechanism of action&lt;/a&gt;, confirmation that there is no intellectual property conflict). This is followed by the &lt;a href=\"hit%20to%20lead\"&gt;hit to lead&lt;/a&gt; stage of drug discovery, where derivatives of the active compound are produced in an attempt to improve its &lt;a href=\"Potency%20%28pharmacology%29\"&gt;potency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toxicity\"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt;. In this and related ways, modern medicines can be developed directly from natural sources.\nAlthough traditional medicines and other biological material are considered an excellent source of novel compounds, the extraction and isolation of these compounds can be a slow, expensive and inefficient process. For large scale manufacture therefore, attempts may be made to produce the new compound by total synthesis or semisynthesis. Because natural products are generally &lt;a href=\"secondary%20metabolite\"&gt;secondary metabolite&lt;/a&gt;s with complex &lt;a href=\"chemical%20structure\"&gt;chemical structure&lt;/a&gt;s, their total/semisynthesis is not always commercially viable. In these cases, efforts can be made to design simpler &lt;a href=\"Analog%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;analogue&lt;/a&gt;s with comparable potency and safety that are amenable to total/semisynthesis.\nProkaryotic.\nBacteria.\nThe serendipitous discovery and subsequent clinical success of &lt;a href=\"penicillin\"&gt;penicillin&lt;/a&gt; prompted a large-scale search for other environmental &lt;a href=\"microorganisms\"&gt;microorganisms&lt;/a&gt; that might produce anti-infective natural products. Soil and water samples were collected from all over the world, leading to the discovery of &lt;a href=\"streptomycin\"&gt;streptomycin&lt;/a&gt; (derived from \"&lt;a href=\"Streptomyces%20griseus\"&gt;Streptomyces griseus&lt;/a&gt;\"), and the realization that bacteria, not just fungi, represent an important source of pharmacologically active natural products. This, in turn, led to the development of an impressive arsenal of antibacterial and antifungal agents including &lt;a href=\"amphotericin%20B\"&gt;amphotericin B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chloramphenicol\"&gt;chloramphenicol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"daptomycin\"&gt;daptomycin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tetracycline\"&gt;tetracycline&lt;/a&gt; (from \"&lt;a href=\"Streptomyces\"&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;spp.&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"polymyxin\"&gt;polymyxin&lt;/a&gt;s (from \"&lt;a href=\"Paenibacillus%20polymyxa\"&gt;Paenibacillus polymyxa&lt;/a&gt;\"), and the &lt;a href=\"rifamycins\"&gt;rifamycins&lt;/a&gt; (from \"&lt;a href=\"Amycolatopsis%20rifamycinica\"&gt;Amycolatopsis rifamycinica&lt;/a&gt;\").\nAlthough most of the drugs derived from bacteria are employed as anti-infectives, some have found use in other fields of medicine. &lt;a href=\"Botulinum%20toxin\"&gt;Botulinum toxin&lt;/a&gt; (from \"&lt;a href=\"Clostridium%20botulinum\"&gt;Clostridium botulinum&lt;/a&gt;\") and &lt;a href=\"bleomycin\"&gt;bleomycin&lt;/a&gt; (from \"&lt;a href=\"Streptomyces%20verticillus\"&gt;Streptomyces verticillus&lt;/a&gt;\") are two examples. Botulinum, the &lt;a href=\"neurotoxin\"&gt;neurotoxin&lt;/a&gt; responsible for &lt;a href=\"botulism\"&gt;botulism&lt;/a&gt;, can be injected into specific muscles (such as those controlling the eyelid) to prevent &lt;a href=\"muscle%20spasm\"&gt;muscle spasm&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the &lt;a href=\"glycopeptide\"&gt;glycopeptide&lt;/a&gt; bleomycin is used for the treatment of several cancers including &lt;a href=\"Hodgkin%27s%20lymphoma\"&gt;Hodgkin's lymphoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"head%20and%20neck%20cancer\"&gt;head and neck cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"testicular%20cancer\"&gt;testicular cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Newer trends in the field include the metabolic profiling and isolation of natural products from novel bacterial species present in underexplored environments. Examples include &lt;a href=\"symbionts\"&gt;symbionts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"endophytes\"&gt;endophytes&lt;/a&gt; from tropical environments, subterranean bacteria found deep underground via mining/drilling, and &lt;a href=\"Marine%20%28ocean%29\"&gt;marine&lt;/a&gt; bacteria.\nArchaea.\nBecause many &lt;a href=\"Archaea\"&gt;Archaea&lt;/a&gt; have adapted to life in extreme environments such as &lt;a href=\"polar%20region\"&gt;polar region&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hot%20springs\"&gt;hot springs&lt;/a&gt;, acidic springs, alkaline springs, &lt;a href=\"salt%20lakes\"&gt;salt lakes&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"high%20pressure\"&gt;high pressure&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"deep%20ocean%20water\"&gt;deep ocean water&lt;/a&gt;, they possess enzymes that are functional under quite unusual conditions. These enzymes are of potential use in the &lt;a href=\"food%20industry\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chemical%20industry\"&gt;chemical&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pharmaceutical%20industry\"&gt;pharmaceutical&lt;/a&gt; industries, where biotechnological processes frequently involve high temperatures, extremes of pH, high salt concentrations, and / or high pressure. Examples of enzymes identified to date include &lt;a href=\"amylase\"&gt;amylase&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pullulanase\"&gt;pullulanase&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cyclodextrin%20glycosyltransferase\"&gt;cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cellulase\"&gt;cellulase&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"xylanase\"&gt;xylanase&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chitinase\"&gt;chitinase&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"protease\"&gt;protease&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"alcohol%20dehydrogenase\"&gt;alcohol dehydrogenase&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"esterase\"&gt;esterase&lt;/a&gt;s. Archaea represent a source of novel &lt;a href=\"chemical%20compounds\"&gt;chemical compounds&lt;/a&gt; also, for example isoprenyl glycerol ethers 1 and 2 from \"&lt;a href=\"Thermococcus\"&gt;Thermococcus&lt;/a&gt;\" S557 and \"&lt;a href=\"Methanocaldococcus%20jannaschii\"&gt;Methanocaldococcus jannaschii&lt;/a&gt;\", respectively.\nEukaryotic.\nFungi.\nSeveral anti-infective medications have been derived from fungi including &lt;a href=\"penicillin\"&gt;penicillin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"cephalosporins\"&gt;cephalosporins&lt;/a&gt; (antibacterial drugs from \"&lt;a href=\"Penicillium%20chrysogenum\"&gt;Penicillium chrysogenum&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Cephalosporium%20acremonium\"&gt;Cephalosporium acremonium&lt;/a&gt;\", respectively) and &lt;a href=\"griseofulvin\"&gt;griseofulvin&lt;/a&gt; (an antifungal drug from \"&lt;a href=\"Penicillium%20griseofulvum\"&gt;Penicillium griseofulvum&lt;/a&gt;\"). Other medicinally useful fungal &lt;a href=\"metabolite\"&gt;metabolite&lt;/a&gt;s include &lt;a href=\"lovastatin\"&gt;lovastatin&lt;/a&gt; (from \"&lt;a href=\"Pleurotus%20ostreatus\"&gt;Pleurotus ostreatus&lt;/a&gt;\"), which became a lead for a series of drugs that lower &lt;a href=\"cholesterol\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; levels, &lt;a href=\"cyclosporin\"&gt;cyclosporin&lt;/a&gt; (from \"&lt;a href=\"Tolypocladium%20inflatum\"&gt;Tolypocladium inflatum&lt;/a&gt;\"), which is used to suppress the &lt;a href=\"immune%20response\"&gt;immune response&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"organ%20transplant\"&gt;organ transplant&lt;/a&gt; operations, and &lt;a href=\"ergometrine\"&gt;ergometrine&lt;/a&gt; (from \"&lt;a href=\"Claviceps\"&gt;Claviceps&lt;/a&gt;\" spp.), which acts as a &lt;a href=\"Vasoconstriction\"&gt;vasoconstrictor&lt;/a&gt;, and is used to prevent bleeding after childbirth. &lt;a href=\"Asperlicin\"&gt;Asperlicin&lt;/a&gt; (from \"&lt;a href=\"Aspergillus%20alliaceus\"&gt;Aspergillus alliaceus&lt;/a&gt;\") is another example. Asperlicin is a novel antagonist of &lt;a href=\"cholecystokinin\"&gt;cholecystokinin&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"neurotransmitter\"&gt;neurotransmitter&lt;/a&gt; thought to be involved in &lt;a href=\"panic%20attacks\"&gt;panic attacks&lt;/a&gt;, and could potentially be used to treat &lt;a href=\"anxiety\"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlants.\nPlants are a major source of complex and highly structurally diverse chemical compounds (&lt;a href=\"phytochemicals\"&gt;phytochemicals&lt;/a&gt;), this structural diversity attributed in part to the &lt;a href=\"natural%20selection\"&gt;natural selection&lt;/a&gt; of organisms producing &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Apotent\"&gt;potent&lt;/a&gt; compounds to deter &lt;a href=\"herbivore\"&gt;herbivory&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Plant%20defense%20against%20herbivory%23Types\"&gt;feeding deterrents&lt;/a&gt;). Major classes of phytochemical include &lt;a href=\"natural%20phenol\"&gt;phenol&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"polyphenol\"&gt;polyphenol&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tannin\"&gt;tannin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"terpene\"&gt;terpene&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"alkaloid\"&gt;alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;s. Though the number of plants that have been extensively studied is relatively small, many pharmacologically active natural products have already been identified. Clinically useful examples include the &lt;a href=\"anticancer\"&gt;anticancer&lt;/a&gt; agents &lt;a href=\"paclitaxel\"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"omacetaxine%20mepesuccinate\"&gt;omacetaxine mepesuccinate&lt;/a&gt; (from \"&lt;a href=\"Taxus%20brevifolia\"&gt;Taxus brevifolia&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Cephalotaxus%20harringtonii\"&gt;Cephalotaxus harringtonii&lt;/a&gt;\", respectively), the &lt;a href=\"antimalarial\"&gt;antimalarial&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"artemisinin\"&gt;artemisinin&lt;/a&gt; (from \"&lt;a href=\"Artemisia%20annua\"&gt;Artemisia annua&lt;/a&gt;\"), and the &lt;a href=\"acetylcholinesterase%20inhibitor\"&gt;acetylcholinesterase inhibitor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"galantamine\"&gt;galantamine&lt;/a&gt; (from \"&lt;a href=\"Galanthus\"&gt;Galanthus&lt;/a&gt;\" spp.), used to treat &lt;a href=\"Alzheimer%27s%20disease\"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. Other plant-derived drugs, used medicinally and/or &lt;a href=\"Recreational%20drug%20use\"&gt;recreationally&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href=\"morphine\"&gt;morphine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"quinine\"&gt;quinine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tubocurarine\"&gt;tubocurarine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"muscarine\"&gt;muscarine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"nicotine\"&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnimals.\nAnimals also represent a source of bioactive natural products. In particular, &lt;a href=\"venom\"&gt;venom&lt;/a&gt;ous animals such as snakes, spiders, scorpions, caterpillars, bees, wasps, centipedes, ants, toads, and frogs have attracted much attention. This is because venom constituents (peptides, enzymes, nucleotides, lipids, biogenic amines etc.) often have very specific interactions with a &lt;a href=\"macromolecular\"&gt;macromolecular&lt;/a&gt; target in the body (e.g. \u03b1-bungarotoxin from &lt;a href=\"cobra\"&gt;cobra&lt;/a&gt;s). As with plant feeding deterrents, this biological activity is attributed to natural selection, organisms capable of killing or paralyzing their prey and/or defending themselves against predators being more likely to survive and reproduce.\nBecause of these specific chemical-target interactions, venom constituents have proved important tools for studying &lt;a href=\"Receptor%20%28biochemistry%29\"&gt;receptors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ion%20channel\"&gt;ion channel&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"enzyme\"&gt;enzyme&lt;/a&gt;s. In some cases, they have also served as leads in the development of novel drugs. For example, teprotide, a peptide isolated from the venom of the Brazilian pit viper \"&lt;a href=\"Bothrops%20jararaca\"&gt;Bothrops jararaca&lt;/a&gt;\", was a lead in the development of the &lt;a href=\"antihypertensive\"&gt;antihypertensive&lt;/a&gt; agents &lt;a href=\"cilazapril\"&gt;cilazapril&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"captopril\"&gt;captopril&lt;/a&gt;. Also, echistatin, a &lt;a href=\"disintegrin\"&gt;disintegrin&lt;/a&gt; from the venom of the saw-scaled viper \"&lt;a href=\"Echis%20carinatus\"&gt;Echis carinatus&lt;/a&gt;\" was a lead in the development of the &lt;a href=\"antiplatelet%20drug\"&gt;antiplatelet drug&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tirofiban\"&gt;tirofiban&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to the &lt;a href=\"terrestrial%20animal\"&gt;terrestrial animal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"amphibian\"&gt;amphibian&lt;/a&gt;s described above, many &lt;a href=\"Marine%20%28ocean%29\"&gt;marine&lt;/a&gt; animals have been examined for pharmacologically active natural products, with &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sea%20sponge\"&gt;sponges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tunicate\"&gt;tunicate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sea%20snail\"&gt;sea snail&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"bryozoa\"&gt;bryozoa&lt;/a&gt;ns yielding chemicals with interesting &lt;a href=\"analgesic\"&gt;analgesic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antiviral%20drug\"&gt;antiviral&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"anticancer\"&gt;anticancer&lt;/a&gt; activities. Two examples developed for clinical use include \u03c9-&lt;a href=\"conotoxin\"&gt;conotoxin&lt;/a&gt; (from the marine snail \"&lt;a href=\"Conus%20magus\"&gt;Conus magus&lt;/a&gt;\") and &lt;a href=\"trabectedin\"&gt;ecteinascidin 743&lt;/a&gt; (from the tunicate \"&lt;a href=\"Ecteinascidia%20turbinata\"&gt;Ecteinascidia turbinata&lt;/a&gt;\"). The former, \u03c9-conotoxin, is used to relieve severe and chronic pain, while the latter, ecteinascidin 743 is used to treat &lt;a href=\"metastasis\"&gt;metastatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"soft%20tissue%20sarcoma\"&gt;soft tissue sarcoma&lt;/a&gt;. Other natural products derived from marine animals and under investigation as possible therapies include the &lt;a href=\"antitumour\"&gt;antitumour&lt;/a&gt; agents &lt;a href=\"discodermolide\"&gt;discodermolide&lt;/a&gt; (from the sponge \"&lt;a href=\"Discodermia%20dissoluta\"&gt;Discodermia dissoluta&lt;/a&gt;\"), &lt;a href=\"eleutherobin\"&gt;eleutherobin&lt;/a&gt; (from the coral \"&lt;a href=\"Erythropodium%20caribaeorum\"&gt;Erythropodium caribaeorum&lt;/a&gt;\"), and the &lt;a href=\"bryostatins\"&gt;bryostatins&lt;/a&gt; (from the bryozoan \"&lt;a href=\"Bugula%20neritina\"&gt;Bugula neritina&lt;/a&gt;\").\nMedical uses.\nNatural products sometimes have pharmacological activity that can be of therapeutic benefit in treating diseases. Moreover, synthetic analogs of natural products with improved potency and safety can be prepared and therefore natural products are often used as starting points for &lt;a href=\"drug%20discovery\"&gt;drug discovery&lt;/a&gt;. Natural product constituents have inspired numerous drug discovery efforts that eventually gained approval as new drugs\nTraditional medicine.\n&lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples\"&gt;Indigenous peoples&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ancient%20civilizations\"&gt;ancient civilizations&lt;/a&gt; experimented with various plant and animal parts to determine what effect they might have. Through &lt;a href=\"trial%20and%20error\"&gt;trial and error&lt;/a&gt; in isolated cases, &lt;a href=\"traditional%20healer\"&gt;traditional healer&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"shamans\"&gt;shamans&lt;/a&gt; found some sources to provide therapeutic effect, representing knowledge of a &lt;a href=\"crude%20drug\"&gt;crude drug&lt;/a&gt; that was passed down through generations in such practices as &lt;a href=\"traditional%20Chinese%20medicine\"&gt;traditional Chinese medicine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayurveda\"&gt;Ayurveda&lt;/a&gt;. Extracts of some natural products led to modern discovery of their active constituents and eventually to the development of new drugs.\nModern natural product-derived drugs.\nA large number of currently prescribed drugs have been either directly derived from or inspired by natural products.\nSome of the oldest natural product based drugs are &lt;a href=\"analgesic\"&gt;analgesic&lt;/a&gt;s. The bark of the &lt;a href=\"willow\"&gt;willow&lt;/a&gt; tree has been known from antiquity to have pain relieving properties. This is due to presence of the natural product &lt;a href=\"salicin\"&gt;salicin&lt;/a&gt; which in turn may be hydrolyzed into &lt;a href=\"salicylic%20acid\"&gt;salicylic acid&lt;/a&gt;. A synthetic derivative &lt;a href=\"acetylsalicylic%20acid\"&gt;acetylsalicylic acid&lt;/a&gt; better known as aspirin is a widely used pain reliever. Its mechanism of action is inhibition of the &lt;a href=\"cyclooxygenase\"&gt;cyclooxygenase&lt;/a&gt; (COX) enzyme. Another notable example is &lt;a href=\"opium\"&gt;opium&lt;/a&gt; is extracted from the latex from \"Papaver somniferous\" (a flowering poppy plant). The most potent narcotic component of opium is the alkaloid &lt;a href=\"morphine\"&gt;morphine&lt;/a&gt; which acts as an &lt;a href=\"opioid%20receptor\"&gt;opioid receptor&lt;/a&gt; agonist. A more recent example is the &lt;a href=\"N-type%20calcium%20channel\"&gt;N-type calcium channel&lt;/a&gt; blocker &lt;a href=\"ziconotide\"&gt;ziconotide&lt;/a&gt; analgesic which is based on a cyclic peptide cone snail toxin (\u03c9-&lt;a href=\"conotoxin\"&gt;conotoxin&lt;/a&gt; MVIIA) from the species \"&lt;a href=\"Conus%20magus\"&gt;Conus magus&lt;/a&gt;\".\nA significant number of &lt;a href=\"Infection%23Treatments\"&gt;anti-infectives&lt;/a&gt; are based on natural products. The first antibiotic to be discovered, &lt;a href=\"penicillin\"&gt;penicillin&lt;/a&gt;, was isolated from the mold \"&lt;a href=\"Penicillium\"&gt;Penicillium&lt;/a&gt;\". Penicillin and related &lt;a href=\"beta%20lactam\"&gt;beta lactam&lt;/a&gt;s work by inhibiting &lt;a href=\"DD-transpeptidase\"&gt;DD-transpeptidase&lt;/a&gt; enzyme that is required by bacteria to cross link &lt;a href=\"peptidoglycan\"&gt;peptidoglycan&lt;/a&gt; to form the cell wall.\nSeveral natural product drugs target &lt;a href=\"tubulin\"&gt;tubulin&lt;/a&gt;, which is a component of the &lt;a href=\"cytoskeleton\"&gt;cytoskeleton&lt;/a&gt;. These include the tubulin polymerization inhibitor &lt;a href=\"colchicine\"&gt;colchicine&lt;/a&gt; isolated from the \"&lt;a href=\"Colchicum%20autumnale\"&gt;Colchicum autumnale&lt;/a&gt;\" (autumn crocus flowering plant), which is used to treat &lt;a href=\"gout\"&gt;gout&lt;/a&gt;. Colchicine is biosynthesized from the amino acids &lt;a href=\"phenylalanine\"&gt;phenylalanine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tryptophan\"&gt;tryptophan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Paclitaxel\"&gt;Paclitaxel&lt;/a&gt;, in contrast, is a tubulin polymerization stabilizer and is used as a &lt;a href=\"chemotherapeutic\"&gt;chemotherapeutic&lt;/a&gt; drug. Paclitaxel is based on the terpenoid natural product &lt;a href=\"taxol\"&gt;taxol&lt;/a&gt;, which is isolated from \"&lt;a href=\"Taxus%20brevifolia\"&gt;Taxus brevifolia&lt;/a&gt;\" (the pacific yew tree).\nA class of drugs widely used to lower cholesterol are the &lt;a href=\"HMG-CoA%20reductase\"&gt;HMG-CoA reductase&lt;/a&gt; inhibitors, for example &lt;a href=\"atorvastatin\"&gt;atorvastatin&lt;/a&gt;. These were developed from &lt;a href=\"mevastatin\"&gt;mevastatin&lt;/a&gt;, a polyketide produced by the fungus \"Penicillium citrinum\". Finally, a number natural product drugs are used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. These include the &lt;a href=\"angiotensin-converting%20enzyme\"&gt;angiotensin-converting enzyme&lt;/a&gt; inhibitor &lt;a href=\"captopril\"&gt;captopril&lt;/a&gt;. Captopril is based on the peptidic bradykinin potentiating factor isolated from venom of the Brazilian arrowhead viper (\"&lt;a href=\"Bothrops%20jararaca\"&gt;Bothrops jararaca&lt;/a&gt;\").\nLimiting and enabling factors.\nNumerous challenges limit the use of natural products for drug discovery, resulting in 21st century preference by pharmaceutical companies to dedicate discovery efforts toward &lt;a href=\"high-throughput%20screening\"&gt;high-throughput screening&lt;/a&gt; of pure synthetic compounds with shorter timelines to refinement. Natural product sources are often unreliable to access and supply, have a high probability of duplication, inherently create intellectual property concerns about &lt;a href=\"patent%20protection\"&gt;patent protection&lt;/a&gt;, vary in composition due to sourcing season or environment, and are susceptible to rising &lt;a href=\"extinction\"&gt;extinction&lt;/a&gt; rates.\nThe biological resource for drug discovery from natural products remains abundant, with small percentages of microorganisms, plant species, and insects assessed for bioactivity. In enormous numbers, bacteria and marine microorganisms remain unexamined. As of 2008, the field of &lt;a href=\"metagenomics\"&gt;metagenomics&lt;/a&gt; was proposed to examine genes and their function in soil microbes, but most pharmaceutical firms have not exploited this resource fully, choosing instead to develop \"diversity-oriented synthesis\" from libraries of known drugs or natural sources for lead compounds with higher potential for bioactivity.\nIsolation and purification.\nAll natural products begin as mixtures with other compounds from the natural source, often very complex mixtures, from which the product of interest must be isolated and purified. The \"isolation\" of a natural product refers, depending on context, either to the isolation of sufficient quantities of pure chemical matter for chemical structure elucidation, derivitzation/degradation chemistry, biological testing, and other research needs (generally milligrams to grams, but historically, often more), or to the isolation of \"analytical quantities\" of the substance of interest, where the focus is on identification and quantitation of the substance (e.g. in biological tissue or fluid), and where the quantity isolated depends on the analytical method applied (but is generally always sub-microgram in scale). The ease with which the active agent can be isolated and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20purification%20methods%20in%20chemistry\"&gt;purified&lt;/a&gt; depends on the structure, stability, and quantity of the natural product. The methods of isolation applied toward achieving these two distinct scales of product are likewise distinct, but generally involve &lt;a href=\"extraction%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;extraction&lt;/a&gt;, precipitation, adsorptions, &lt;a href=\"chromatography\"&gt;chromatography&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes &lt;a href=\"crystallization\"&gt;crystallization&lt;/a&gt;s. In both cases, the isolated substance is purified to \"chemical homogeneity\", i.e. specific combined separation and analytical methods such as &lt;a href=\"Liquid%20chromatography%E2%80%93mass%20spectrometry\"&gt;LC-MS&lt;/a&gt; methods are chosen to be \"orthogonal\"\u2014achieving their separations based on distinct modes of interaction between substance and isolating matrix\u2014with the goal being repeated detection of only a single species present in the putative pure sample. Early isolation is almost inevitably followed by \"structure determination\", especially if an important pharmacologic activity is associated with the purified natural product.\nStructure determination refers to methods applied to determine the &lt;a href=\"chemical%20structure\"&gt;chemical structure&lt;/a&gt; of an isolated, pure natural product, a process that involves an array of chemical and physical methods that have changed markedly over the history of natural products research; in earliest days, these focused on chemical transformation of unknown substances into known substances, and measurement of physical properties such as melting point and boiling point, and related methods for determining molecular weight. In the modern era, methods focus on &lt;a href=\"mass%20spectrometry\"&gt;mass spectrometry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NMR\"&gt;nuclear magnetic resonance methods&lt;/a&gt;, often multidimensional, and, when feasible, small molecule &lt;a href=\"crystallography\"&gt;crystallography&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, the &lt;a href=\"chemical%20structure\"&gt;chemical structure&lt;/a&gt; of penicillin was determined by &lt;a href=\"Dorothy%20Hodgkin\"&gt;Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin&lt;/a&gt; in 1945, work for which she later received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1964).\nSynthesis.\nMany natural products have very complex &lt;a href=\"chemical%20structure\"&gt;structures&lt;/a&gt;. The perceived complexity of a natural product is a qualitative matter, consisting of consideration of its molecular mass, the particular arrangements of substructures (&lt;a href=\"functional%20groups\"&gt;functional groups&lt;/a&gt;, rings etc.) with respect to one another, the number and density of those functional groups, the stability of those groups and of the molecule as a whole, the number and type of &lt;a href=\"chiral\"&gt;stereochemical elements&lt;/a&gt;, the physical properties of the molecule and its intermediates (which bear on the ease of its handling and purification), all of these viewed in the context of the novelty of the structure and whether preceding related synthetic efforts have been successful (see below for details). Some natural products, especially those less complex, are easily and cost-effectively prepared via complete chemical synthesis from readily available, simpler chemical ingredients, a process referred to as &lt;a href=\"total%20synthesis\"&gt;total synthesis&lt;/a&gt; (especially when the process involves no steps mediated by biological agents). Not all natural products are amenable to total synthesis, cost-effective or otherwise. In particular, those most complex often are not. Many are accessible, but the required routes are simply too expensive to allow synthesis on any practical or industrial scale. However, to be available for further study, all natural products must yield to isolation and purification. This may suffice if isolation provides appropriate quantities of the natural product for the intended purpose (e.g. as a drug to alleviate disease). Drugs such as &lt;a href=\"penicillin\"&gt;penicillin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"morphine\"&gt;morphine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"paclitaxel\"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/a&gt; proved to be affordably acquired at needed commercial scales solely via isolation procedures (without any significant synthetic chemistry contributing). However, in other cases, needed agents are not available without synthetic chemistry manipulations.\nSemisynthesis.\nThe process of isolating a natural product from its source can be costly in terms of committed time and material expense, and it may challenge the availability of the relied upon natural resource (or have ecological consequences for the resource). For instance, it has been estimated that the &lt;a href=\"bark%20%28botany%29\"&gt;bark&lt;/a&gt; of an entire &lt;a href=\"Taxus%20brevifolia\"&gt;yew tree&lt;/a&gt; (\"Taxus brevifolia\") would have to be harvested to extract enough &lt;a href=\"paclitaxel\"&gt;paclitaxel&lt;/a&gt; for just a single dose of therapy. Furthermore, the number of &lt;a href=\"structural%20analog\"&gt;structural analog&lt;/a&gt;ues obtainable for &lt;a href=\"structure%E2%80%93activity%20relationship\"&gt;structure\u2013activity analysis&lt;/a&gt; (SAR) simply via harvest (if more than one structural analogue is even present) is limited by the biology at work in the organism, and so outside of the experimentalist's control.\nIn such cases where the ultimate target is harder to come by, or limits SAR, it is sometimes possible to source a middle-to-late stage biosynthetic precursor or analogue from which the ultimate target can be prepared. This is termed &lt;a href=\"semisynthesis\"&gt;semisynthesis&lt;/a&gt; or \"partial synthesis\". With this approach, the related biosynthetic intermediate is harvested and then converted to the final product by conventional procedures of &lt;a href=\"chemical%20synthesis\"&gt;chemical synthesis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis strategy can have two advantages. Firstly, the intermediate may be more easily extracted, and in higher yield, than the ultimate desired product. An example of this is paclitaxel, which can be manufactured by extracting &lt;a href=\"10-deacetylbaccatin%20III\"&gt;10-deacetylbaccatin III&lt;/a&gt; from \"T. brevifolia\" &lt;a href=\"Needle%20%28botany%29\"&gt;needles&lt;/a&gt;, then carrying out a four-step synthesis. Secondly, the route designed between semisynthetic starting material and ultimate product may permit analogues of the final product to be synthesized. The newer generation semisynthetic &lt;a href=\"penicillins\"&gt;penicillins&lt;/a&gt; are an illustration of the benefit of this approach.\nTotal synthesis.\nIn general, the &lt;a href=\"total%20synthesis\"&gt;total synthesis&lt;/a&gt; of natural products is a non-commercial research activity, aimed at deeper understanding of the synthesis of particular natural product frameworks, and the development of fundamental new synthetic methods. Even so, it is of tremendous commercial and societal importance. By providing challenging synthetic targets, for example, it has played a central role in the development of the field of &lt;a href=\"organic%20chemistry\"&gt;organic chemistry&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the development of &lt;a href=\"analytical%20chemistry\"&gt;analytical chemistry&lt;/a&gt; methods in the twentieth century, the structures of natural products were affirmed by total synthesis (so-called \"structure proof by synthesis\"). Early efforts in &lt;a href=\"total%20synthesis\"&gt;natural products synthesis&lt;/a&gt; targeted complex substances such as &lt;a href=\"Vitamin%20B12\"&gt;cobalamin&lt;/a&gt; (vitamin B12), an essential &lt;a href=\"cofactor%20%28biochemistry%29\"&gt;cofactor&lt;/a&gt; in cellular &lt;a href=\"metabolism\"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.\nSymmetry.\nExamination of &lt;a href=\"Dimer%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;dimerized&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dimer%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;trimerized&lt;/a&gt; natural products has shown that an element of bilateral symmetry is often present. Bilateral symmetry refers to a molecule or system that contains a C2, Cs, or C2v point group identity. C2 symmetry tends to be much more abundant than other types of bilateral symmetry. This finding sheds light on how these compounds might be mechanistically created, as well as providing insight into the thermodynamic properties that make these compounds more favorable. &lt;a href=\"Density%20functional%20theory\"&gt;Density functional theoretical (DFT)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hartree%E2%80%93Fock%20method\"&gt;Hartree Fock&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Semi-empirical%20quantum%20chemistry%20method\"&gt;semiempirical&lt;/a&gt; calculations also show some favorability for dimerization in natural products due to evolution of more energy per bond than the equivalent trimer or tetramer. This is proposed to be due to &lt;a href=\"steric%20hindrance\"&gt;steric hindrance&lt;/a&gt; at the core of the molecule, as most natural products dimerize and trimerize in a head-to-head fashion rather than head-to-tail.\nResearch and teaching.\nResearch and teaching activities related to natural products fall into a number of diverse academic areas, including &lt;a href=\"organic%20chemistry\"&gt;organic chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"medicinal%20chemistry\"&gt;medicinal chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pharmacognosy\"&gt;pharmacognosy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ethnobotany\"&gt;ethnobotany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"traditional%20medicine\"&gt;traditional medicine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ethnopharmacology\"&gt;ethnopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;. Other biological areas include &lt;a href=\"chemical%20biology\"&gt;chemical biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chemical%20ecology\"&gt;chemical ecology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chemogenomics\"&gt;chemogenomics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"systems%20biology\"&gt;systems biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"molecular%20modeling\"&gt;molecular modeling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chemometrics\"&gt;chemometrics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"chemoinformatics\"&gt;chemoinformatics&lt;/a&gt;.\nChemistry.\nNatural products chemistry is a distinct area of chemical research which was important in the development and &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20chemistry\"&gt;history of chemistry&lt;/a&gt;. Isolating and identifying natural products has been important to source substances for early preclinical drug discovery research, to understand &lt;a href=\"traditional%20medicine\"&gt;traditional medicine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ethnopharmacology\"&gt;ethnopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;, and to find pharmacologically useful areas of &lt;a href=\"Drug%20discovery%23Chemical%20diversity%20of%20natural%20products\"&gt;chemical space&lt;/a&gt;. To achieve this, many technological advances have been made, such as the evolution of technology associated with &lt;a href=\"Liquid%20chromatography%E2%80%93mass%20spectrometry\"&gt;chemical separations&lt;/a&gt;, and the development of modern methods in &lt;a href=\"chemical%20structure%20determination\"&gt;chemical structure determination&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"NMR\"&gt;NMR&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, natural products are prepared by &lt;a href=\"organic%20synthesis\"&gt;organic synthesis&lt;/a&gt;, to provide confirmation of their structure, or to give access to larger quantities of natural products of interest. In this process, the structure of some natural products have been revised, and the challenge of synthesising natural products has led to the development of new synthetic methodology, &lt;a href=\"total%20synthesis\"&gt;synthetic strategy, and tactics&lt;/a&gt;. In this regard, natural products play a central role in the training of new synthetic organic chemists, and are a principal motivation in the development of new variants of old chemical reactions (e.g., the &lt;a href=\"Evans%20aldol\"&gt;Evans aldol&lt;/a&gt; reaction), as well as the discovery of completely new chemical reactions (e.g., the &lt;a href=\"Woodward%20cis-hydroxylation\"&gt;Woodward cis-hydroxylation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sharpless%20epoxidation\"&gt;Sharpless epoxidation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Suzuki%20reaction\"&gt;Suzuki\u2013Miyaura&lt;/a&gt; cross-coupling reactions).\nBiochemistry.\nThe biosynthesis of natural products is interest. Knowledge of the biosynthesis enables improved routes to valuable natural products. This knowledge can then be used to access larger quantities of natural products with interesting biological activity, and allow medicinally useful natural products, such as alkaloids to be produced more efficiently and economically.\nHistory.\nFoundations of organic and natural product chemistry.\nThe concept of natural products dates back to the early 19th century, when the foundations of &lt;a href=\"organic%20chemistry\"&gt;organic chemistry&lt;/a&gt; were laid. Organic chemistry was regarded at that time as the chemistry of substances that plants and animals are composed of. It was a relatively complex form of chemistry and stood in stark contrast to &lt;a href=\"inorganic%20chemistry\"&gt;inorganic chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, the principles of which had been established in 1789 by the Frenchman &lt;a href=\"Antoine%20Lavoisier\"&gt;Antoine Lavoisier&lt;/a&gt; in his work \"&lt;a href=\"Trait%C3%A9%20%C3%89l%C3%A9mentaire%20de%20Chimie\"&gt;Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIsolation.\nLavoisier showed at the end of the 18th century that organic substances consisted of a limited number of elements: primarily carbon and hydrogen and supplemented by oxygen and nitrogen. He quickly focused on the isolation of these substances, often because they had an interesting pharmacological activity. Plants were the main source of such compounds, especially &lt;a href=\"alkaloids\"&gt;alkaloids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"glycoside\"&gt;glycoside&lt;/a&gt;s. It was long been known that opium, a sticky mixture of alkaloids (including &lt;a href=\"codeine\"&gt;codeine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"morphine\"&gt;morphine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"noscapine\"&gt;noscapine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"thebaine\"&gt;thebaine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"papaverine\"&gt;papaverine&lt;/a&gt;) from the opium poppy (&lt;a href=\"Papaver%20somniferum\"&gt;Papaver somniferum&lt;/a&gt;), possessed a narcotic and at the same time mind-altering properties. By 1805, morphine had already been isolated by the German chemist &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Sert%C3%BCrner\"&gt;Friedrich Sert\u00fcrner&lt;/a&gt; and in the 1870s it was discovered that boiling morphine with &lt;a href=\"acetic%20anhydride\"&gt;acetic anhydride&lt;/a&gt; produced a substance with a strong pain suppressive effect: heroin. In 1815, &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20Chevreul\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul&lt;/a&gt; isolated &lt;a href=\"cholesterol\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, a crystalline substance, from animal tissue that belongs to the class of steroids, and in 1820 &lt;a href=\"strychnine\"&gt;strychnine&lt;/a&gt;, an alkaloid was isolated.\nSynthesis.\nA second important step was the synthesis of organic compounds. Whereas the synthesis of inorganic substances had been known for a long time, the synthesis of organic substances was a difficult hurdle. In 1827 the Swedish chemist &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B6ns%20Jacob%20Berzelius\"&gt;J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius&lt;/a&gt; held that an indispensable force of nature for the synthesis of organic compounds, called vital force or life force, was needed. This philosophical idea, &lt;a href=\"vitalism\"&gt;vitalism&lt;/a&gt;, well into the 19th century had many supporters, even after the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"atomic%20theory\"&gt;atomic theory&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of vitalism especially fitted in with beliefs in medicine; the most traditional healing practices believed that disease was the result of some imbalance in the vital energies that distinguishes life from nonlife. A first attempt to break the vitalism idea in science was made in 1828, when the German chemist &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler\"&gt;Friedrich W\u00f6hler&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in synthesizing &lt;a href=\"urea\"&gt;urea&lt;/a&gt;, a natural product found in &lt;a href=\"urine\"&gt;urine&lt;/a&gt;, by heating &lt;a href=\"ammonium%20cyanate\"&gt;ammonium cyanate&lt;/a&gt;, an inorganic substance:\nThis reaction showed that there was no need for a life force in order to prepare organic substances. This idea, however, was initially met with a high degree of skepticism, and only 20 years later, with the synthesis of acetic acid from carbon by &lt;a href=\"Adolph%20Wilhelm%20Hermann%20Kolbe\"&gt;Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe&lt;/a&gt;, was the idea accepted. Organic chemistry has since developed into an independent area of research dedicated to the study of carbon-containing compounds, since that element in common was detected in a variety of nature-derived substances. An important factor in the characterization of organic materials was on the basis of their physical properties (such as melting point, boiling point, solubility, crystallinity, or color).\nStructural theories.\nA third step was the structure elucidation of organic substances: although the elemental composition of pure organic substances (irrespective of whether they were of natural or synthetic origin) could be determined fairly accurately, the molecular structure was still a problem. The urge to do structural elucidation resulted from a dispute between Friedrich W\u00f6hler and &lt;a href=\"Justus%20von%20Liebig\"&gt;Justus von Liebig&lt;/a&gt;, who both studied a silver salt of the same composition but had different properties. W\u00f6hler studied &lt;a href=\"silver%20cyanate\"&gt;silver cyanate&lt;/a&gt;, a harmless substance, while von Liebig investigated &lt;a href=\"silver%20fulminate\"&gt;silver fulminate&lt;/a&gt;, a salt with explosive properties. The elemental analysis shows that both salts contain equal quantities of silver, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. According to the then prevailing ideas, both substances should possess the same properties, but this was not the case. This apparent contradiction was later solved by &lt;a href=\"Berzelius\"&gt;Berzelius&lt;/a&gt;'s theory of &lt;a href=\"isomer\"&gt;isomer&lt;/a&gt;s, whereby not only the number and type of elements are of importance to the properties and chemical reactivity, but also the position of atoms in within a compound. This was a direct cause for the development of structure theories, such as the &lt;a href=\"radical%20theory\"&gt;radical theory&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Dumas\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Dumas&lt;/a&gt; and the substitution theory of &lt;a href=\"Auguste%20Laurent\"&gt;Auguste Laurent&lt;/a&gt;. However, it took until 1858 before by &lt;a href=\"August%20Kekul%C3%A9\"&gt;August Kekul\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; formulated a definite structure theory. He posited that carbon is tetravalent and can bind to itself to form carbon chains as they occur in natural products.\nExpanding the concept.\nThe concept of natural product, which initially based on organic compounds that could be isolated from plants, was extended to include animal material in the middle of the 19th century by the German &lt;a href=\"Justus%20von%20Liebig\"&gt;Justus von Liebig&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20Emil%20Fischer\"&gt;Hermann Emil Fischer&lt;/a&gt; in 1884, turned his attention to the study of carbohydrates and purines, work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902. He also succeeded to make synthetically in the laboratory in a variety of carbohydrates, including &lt;a href=\"glucose\"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mannose\"&gt;mannose&lt;/a&gt;. After the discovery of &lt;a href=\"penicillin\"&gt;penicillin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Fleming\"&gt;Alexander Fleming&lt;/a&gt; in 1928, fungi and other micro-organisms were added to the arsenal of sources of natural products.\nMilestones.\nBy the 1930s, several large classes of natural products were known. Important milestones included:"
