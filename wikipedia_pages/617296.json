    "text": "The following is a list of types of seafood. &lt;a href=\"Seafood\"&gt;Seafood&lt;/a&gt; is any form of &lt;a href=\"sea%20life\"&gt;sea life&lt;/a&gt; regarded as &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; by humans. It prominently includes &lt;a href=\"Fish%20%28food%29\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shellfish\"&gt;shellfish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"roe\"&gt;roe&lt;/a&gt;. Shellfish include various species of &lt;a href=\"Mollusca\"&gt;mollusc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crustacean\"&gt;crustacean&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"echinoderm\"&gt;echinoderm&lt;/a&gt;s.
