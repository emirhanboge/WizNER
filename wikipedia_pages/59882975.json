    "text": "\"365\" is a song by German music producer &lt;a href=\"Zedd\"&gt;Zedd&lt;/a&gt; and American singer &lt;a href=\"Katy%20Perry\"&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/a&gt;. It was released on February 14, 2019 along with its music video, directed by &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Fu\"&gt;Warren Fu&lt;/a&gt;. The song reached number one in Bulgaria and Israel as well as the top 10 in Lebanon, Lithuania, Mexico, and Serbia, the top 20 in Argentina, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and the top 30 in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Singapore, and Slovenia.\nBackground.\nIn August 2018, Zedd was the opening act of Perry's in Australia and New Zealand. While on tour, the pair worked together on new music, although Zedd was unsure at the time if the collaboration would result in any material. In January 2019, there were rumors about the upcoming release of the song, which was eventually leaked. It was later registered with &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Music%20Publishing%20Group\"&gt;Universal Music Publishing Group&lt;/a&gt; in February, and the song then appeared registered on &lt;a href=\"Shazam%20%28application%29\"&gt;Shazam&lt;/a&gt; before being removed and re-added again. On February 13, Zedd and Perry began sending emojis to each other on &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; before Zedd shared the trailer for the video.\nCritical reception.\nBrittany Spanos from \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" complimented the track and described it as a \"breezy, hypnotic love song\". Winston Cook-Wilson, in his review for \"&lt;a href=\"Spin%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt;\", wrote that \"365\" was \"a featherweight piece of &lt;a href=\"Pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; that luckily does not sound like every other Zedd song the producer has released in recent memory\".\nMichael Love of \"&lt;a href=\"Paper%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Paper&lt;/a&gt;\" praised \"365\", calling it \"a pretty solid pop tune from Zedd and Perry, which of course, is what also helps you stay till the end.\" According to Mike Nied from \"&lt;a href=\"Idolator%20%28website%29\"&gt;Idolator&lt;/a&gt;\", it had been \"perfectly tailored for a &lt;a href=\"Valentine%27s%20Day\"&gt;Valentine's Day&lt;/a&gt; release\" with its \"sugary sweet lyrics\".\nChart performance.\nIn the US, \"365\" debuted and peaked at number 86 on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;, spending a single week on the chart. Additionally, the song reached number one in Israel, Bulgaria, Portugal and Czech Republic, as well as the top ten in Lebanon, Netherlands, Argentina (Anglo Airplay), United States (&lt;a href=\"Hot%20Dance/Electronic%20Songs\"&gt;Hot Dance/Electronic Songs&lt;/a&gt;), Australia (Dance), Mexico (&lt;a href=\"Mexico%20Airplay\"&gt;Airplay&lt;/a&gt;), Netherlands and Lithuania. It also reached the top 20 in Estonia, Hungary, &lt;a href=\"Dance%20Club%20Songs\"&gt;US Dance Club Songs&lt;/a&gt; and Greece, and top 40 in Australia, the United Kingdom, Scotland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ireland.\nMusic video.\nThe music video, directed by &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Fu\"&gt;Warren Fu&lt;/a&gt;, was released alongside the song on 14 February. It depicts Perry as a robot and Zedd as a human test subject, where an experiment is conducted to test the two living together. The robot starts falling in love with him, but he does not love her back and distances himself from her. She begins to malfunction because of her heartbreak and is deprogrammed.\nReception.\nMichael Love Michael of \"Paper\" acclaimed the themes and cinematography of the music video. He commented: \"Definitely worth crying over if that's what society comes to.\" Corinne Heller from \"&lt;a href=\"E%21%20News\"&gt;E! News&lt;/a&gt;\" noted that in the video, \"Katy Perry plays a creepily obsessive &lt;a href=\"Android%20%28robot%29\"&gt;android&lt;/a&gt;.\" Sam Moore of \"&lt;a href=\"NME\"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt;\" described the video as \"&lt;a href=\"sci-fi\"&gt;sci-fi&lt;/a&gt;-indebted\". \"Idolator\"s Mike Nied praised it as \"essential viewing\". Conversely, Winston Cook-Wilson of \"Spin\" stated that \"Mostly, one just wonders if the money could have been spent better.\"\nCredits and personnel.\nCredits adapted from &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20%28service%29\"&gt;Tidal&lt;/a&gt;."
