    "text": "The Imperial 23 is a British &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20sailer\"&gt;trailerable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt; that was designed by &lt;a href=\"L.%20Wakefield\"&gt;L. Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Cruising%20%28maritime%29\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and first built in 1966. Starting in 1968 it was sold as the Islander 23.\nProduction.\nThe design was built by &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Marine\"&gt;Russell Marine&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, from 1966 until about 1970, but it is now out of production. It was imported into the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; by Wells Yachts.\nDesign.\nThe Imperial 23 is a recreational &lt;a href=\"keelboat\"&gt;keelboat&lt;/a&gt;, built predominantly of &lt;a href=\"glassfibre\"&gt;glassfibre&lt;/a&gt;, with wood trim. It has a &lt;a href=\"masthead%20sloop\"&gt;masthead sloop&lt;/a&gt; rig, a &lt;a href=\"raked%20stem\"&gt;raked stem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"plumb%20stem\"&gt;plumb stem&lt;/a&gt;, a slightly &lt;a href=\"reverse%20transom\"&gt;reverse transom&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"skeg\"&gt;skeg&lt;/a&gt;-mounted &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"tiller\"&gt;tiller&lt;/a&gt; and a fixed twin &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt;s. It displaces and carries of iron ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of with the standard twin keels.\nThe boat is normally fitted with a small &lt;a href=\"outboard%20motor\"&gt;outboard motor&lt;/a&gt; for docking and manoeuvring or, optionally, an &lt;a href=\"inboard%20motor\"&gt;inboard motor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a dual &lt;a href=\"quarter%20berth\"&gt;quarter berth&lt;/a&gt;s in the bow cabin and two straight settee in the aft of the main cabin. The &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; is located on the port side just forward of the &lt;a href=\"companionway\"&gt;companionway&lt;/a&gt; ladder. The galley is equipped with a two-burner stove and a sink. The &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is located in the bow cabin, between the bow quarter berths. The fresh water tank has a capacity of . Cabin headroom is .\nThe design has a &lt;a href=\"hull%20speed\"&gt;hull speed&lt;/a&gt; of .\nOperational history.\nIn a 2010 review American Steve Henkel wrote, \"here is a typical British import of the 1960s: Twin iron keels and a sturdy rudder skeg for lying upright on the English tidal flats without risk of damage; heavy, sturdy hull and relatively small sail area for dealing with brisk English Chanel winds; tabernacle for easier mast lowerings provision for an inboard engine despite the boat's relatively small size. (Re size: The boat measures 22' 6\" from the lower tip of her reverse transom to the forward tip of her galvanized steel anchor roller, thus claiming to be a '23-footer.' On deck she\u2019s only 22' 2\".) Best features: Forward quarter berths instead of the usual V-berths provide easier access to the head, complete with hinged door for privacy. A unique (but optional) 'Autohoist' permits vertical storage of an outboard engine; the skipper winds the motor out of the water with a worm-gear driven winch. Worst features: The jutting samson post on the small foredeck may make picking up and securing a mooring easier, but might worry the foredeck crew who, when in a hurry, could easily trip on the upward-sticking prong.\""
