    "title": "Spanish immigration to Venezuela",
    "text": "Spanish Venezuelans are &lt;a href=\"Venezuelans\"&gt;Venezuelan&lt;/a&gt; citizens of &lt;a href=\"Spaniards\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; origin or descent. There are many Venezuelans of Spanish origin, especially from the &lt;a href=\"Canary%20Islands\"&gt;Canary Islands&lt;/a&gt; (known as \"&lt;a href=\"Isle%C3%B1o\"&gt;Isle\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt;s\"). Most Venezuelans have some Spanish ancestry.\nSpanish immigration to Venezuela begins with the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Spanish colonization of the Americas&lt;/a&gt; and it continued during &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Venezuela\"&gt;Colonial Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; and after independence (1830). Further immigration has taken place since, particularly following &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFrom the beginning of the colonial period and until the end of the Second World War, most European immigrants in Venezuela were Spanish, predominantly Canary Islanders. Their cultural impact was significant, influencing both the development of &lt;a href=\"Castilian%20Spanish\"&gt;Castilian Spanish&lt;/a&gt; in the country as well as its &lt;a href=\"Venezuelan%20cuisine\"&gt;cuisine&lt;/a&gt; and customs. Venezuela has perhaps the largest population of Canarian origin, and it is commonly said in the Canary Islands that \"Venezuela is the eighth island of the Canary Islands.\" In the 16th century, the German conquistador &lt;a href=\"Georg%20von%20Speyer\"&gt;Georg von Speyer&lt;/a&gt; in the Canary Islands recruited 200 men to colonize Venezuela, as did &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Serpa\"&gt;Diego Hern\u00e1ndez de Serpa&lt;/a&gt;, governor of &lt;a href=\"New%20Andalusia%20Province\"&gt;New Andalusia Province&lt;/a&gt;, who sent another 200 soldiers and 400 slaves from &lt;a href=\"Gran%20Canaria\"&gt;Gran Canaria&lt;/a&gt; to Venezuela, where some of these Canarians were among the founders of &lt;a href=\"Cuman%C3%A1\"&gt;Cuman\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 1936, most Canarian immigrants have gone either to Cuba or to Venezuela (some of those who emigrated to Venezuela came from Cuba) due to encouraged immigration by the government, especially Spanish citizens, and since 1948, most have emigrated to Venezuela. Large-scale immigration did not end until the early 1980s with a significant decrease in the 1970s, and the beginning of Canarian emigration to other European countries. Canary Islanders and their descendants are now scattered throughout Venezuela.\nDemographics.\nIn addition, as of 2010, there were around 200,000 Venezuelans residing in Spain. As of January 2016, there were 188,025 Spanish citizens in Venezuela. Most Venezuelans in Spain have &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20nationality\"&gt;Spanish nationality&lt;/a&gt;."
