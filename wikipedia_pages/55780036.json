The tournament was played over four days, from 26 to 29 May. Only the six Irish players competed on the first day, playing a singles match. They then played 5 rounds over the next three days. The English and Scottish competitors played 6 rounds on the remaining three days but in one of those matches they only played a single opponent.\n&lt;a href=\"Harry%20Weetman\"&gt;Harry Weetman&lt;/a&gt; won 9 of his 11 matches and halved another, giving him 19 points, 4 ahead of the rest. He had scored 17 points before the final afternoon round, 6 ahead of anyone else, giving him a guaranteed victory at that point since only 4 points were available in the final round.
