It is below the &lt;a href=\"Gay%20Street%20Bridge\"&gt;Gay Street Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe location of the park is the site of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Holston\"&gt;Treaty of Holston&lt;/a&gt;. In 1988, a 50-member &lt;a href=\"Waterfront%20%28area%29\"&gt;waterfront&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"task%20force\"&gt;task force&lt;/a&gt; was created to analyze the waterfront area along the Tennessee River. Per the recommendations of this task force, a three-phase project to develop Volunteer Landing began in 1995 and continued through 1996. Volunteer Landing was completed in September 1997. Upon this completion, Volunteer Landing had a &lt;a href=\"boardwalk\"&gt;boardwalk&lt;/a&gt;, a central &lt;a href=\"pavilion\"&gt;pavilion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"plaza\"&gt;plaza&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Footbridge\"&gt;pedestrian bridge&lt;/a&gt;, and two new public parks. In April 1999, Gateway Regional Visitor Center which highlighted the region's nature and technology was opened. In Spring 2000, the 140-boat slip Volunteer Landing Marina, was completed. The Regas Riverfront Tavern/Restaurant, which seated about 250 people and had a banquet facility with capacity of 300, was also completed in 2000, concluding the waterfront development project.\nThe state and local government contributed $10 million to Volunteer Landing. The marina was funded with about $3 million in private funds and a $100,000 &lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20Wildlife%20Resources%20Agency\"&gt;Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency&lt;/a&gt; (TWRA) grant. The visitor center was received $5.6 million in federal, state, and local funds. The tavern/restaurant had about $6 million of private funding. The overall cost was $42 million and consisted of both &lt;a href=\"Public%E2%80%93private%20partnership\"&gt;public and private developments&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2007, the Public Building Authority began to manage Volunteer Landing.\nDescription.\nVolunteer Landing has . Two new public parks were built as part of Volunteer Landing. One is called River Mountain Park, and it is west of the central pavilion and demonstrates the region's river and mountain heritage through the landscaping and water features. The second park is at the mouth of First Creek where the city was founded and has exhibits reflecting this history.\nVolunteer Landing Park is a three-acre linear park connects James White Greenway and Neyland Greenway. They are part of the downtown &lt;a href=\"Greenway%20%28landscape%29\"&gt;greenway&lt;/a&gt; system which is 19 miles long and runs east to west.\nActivities.\nThe one-mile walk features several &lt;a href=\"Tourist%20attraction\"&gt;attractions&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"train%20ride\"&gt;train ride&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"River%20cruise\"&gt;riverboat cruises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"restaurant\"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"marina\"&gt;marina&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cycling\"&gt;biking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"walking\"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"running\"&gt;running&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"paddling\"&gt;paddling&lt;/a&gt; are some available activities. During &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Tennessee\"&gt;University of Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; (UT) home &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; games, the &lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20Volunteers%20football%23Vol%20Navy\"&gt;Vol Navy&lt;/a&gt; lines the river at Volunteer Landing as part of a &lt;a href=\"Tailgate%20party\"&gt;tailgating&lt;/a&gt; tradition. There is also a &lt;a href=\"playground\"&gt;playground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"splash%20pad\"&gt;splash pad&lt;/a&gt;s, a shelter, &lt;a href=\"picnic\"&gt;picnic&lt;/a&gt; areas, and &lt;a href=\"restroom\"&gt;restroom&lt;/a&gt;s available.\nDocks.\nOne &lt;a href=\"Dock%20%28maritime%29\"&gt;dock&lt;/a&gt; was originally built for the &lt;a href=\"1982%20World%27s%20Fair\"&gt;1982 World's Fair&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, a privately owned boat hit the dock and damaged it. It was closed afterwards, though the city had already planned improvements prior to the incident. The replacement dock cost $270,000 and 75 percent was financed by a TWRA grant. In April 2018, city-owned 360-foot-long boat dock reopened.\nThe Vol Navy dock is near Neyland Stadium. The dock and concrete pavilion were built 1994 and was funded by a TWRA grant. In 1998, 200 feet were added. In 2019, the new dock was completed. It is nearly 600 feet long. The TWRA funded the project with a $400,000 grant and $100,000 came from the city and UT. The Public Building Authority managed the project. The city owns the dock and UT maintains it."
