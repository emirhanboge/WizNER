    "text": "A mule is the &lt;a href=\"offspring\"&gt;offspring&lt;/a&gt; of a male &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt; (jack) and a female &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"mare\"&gt;mare&lt;/a&gt;). Horses and donkeys are different species, with different numbers of &lt;a href=\"chromosome\"&gt;chromosome&lt;/a&gt;s. Of the two &lt;a href=\"F1%20hybrid\"&gt;first-generation hybrids&lt;/a&gt; between these two species, a mule is easier to obtain than a &lt;a href=\"hinny\"&gt;hinny&lt;/a&gt;, which is the offspring of a female donkey (&lt;a href=\"Jenny%20%28donkey%29\"&gt;jenny&lt;/a&gt;) and a male horse (&lt;a href=\"stallion\"&gt;stallion&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe size of a mule and work to which it is put depend largely on the breeding of the mule's mother (&lt;a href=\"Mare\"&gt;dam&lt;/a&gt;). Mules can be lightweight, medium weight, or when produced from &lt;a href=\"draft%20horse\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; mares, of moderately heavy weight. Mules are reputed to be more patient, hardy, and long-lived than horses, and are described as less obstinate and more intelligent than donkeys.\nBiology.\nThe mule is valued because, while it has the size and ground-covering ability of its dam, it is stronger than a horse of similar size and inherits the endurance and disposition of the donkey sire, tending to require less feed than a horse of similar size. Mules also tend to be more independent than most domesticated equines other than its parental species, the donkey.\nThe median weight range for a mule is between about . While a few mules can carry live weight up to , the superiority of the mule becomes apparent in their additional endurance.\nIn general, a mule can be packed with dead weight up to 20% of its body weight, or around . Although it depends on the individual animal, mules trained by the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;Army of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; are reported to be able to carry up to and walk without resting. The average equine in general can carry up to roughly 30% of its body weight in live weight, such as a rider.\nA female mule that has &lt;a href=\"estrus\"&gt;estrus&lt;/a&gt; cycles, and which could thus in theory carry a fetus, is called a \"molly\" or \"Molly mule\", though the term is sometimes used to refer to female mules in general. Pregnancy is rare, but can occasionally occur naturally, as well as through &lt;a href=\"embryo%20transfer\"&gt;embryo transfer&lt;/a&gt;. A male mule is properly called a \"horse mule\", though often called a \"john mule\", which is the correct term for a &lt;a href=\"Gelding\"&gt;gelded&lt;/a&gt; mule. A young male mule is called a \"mule colt\", and a young female is called a \"mule filly\".\nCharacteristics.\nWith its short, thick head, long ears, thin limbs, small, narrow hooves, and short &lt;a href=\"mane%20%28horse%29\"&gt;mane&lt;/a&gt;, the mule shares characteristics of a donkey. In height and body, shape of neck and &lt;a href=\"Rump%20%28animal%29\"&gt;rump&lt;/a&gt;, uniformity of coat, and teeth, it appears horse-like. The mule occurs in all sizes, shapes, and &lt;a href=\"Equine%20conformation\"&gt;conformations&lt;/a&gt;. Some mules resemble huge draft horses, sturdy &lt;a href=\"American%20Quarter%20Horse\"&gt;Quarter Horses&lt;/a&gt;, fine-boned racing horses, shaggy &lt;a href=\"pony\"&gt;ponies&lt;/a&gt;, and more.\nThe mule is an example of &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20vigor\"&gt;hybrid vigor&lt;/a&gt;. Charles Darwin wrote: \"The mule always appears to me a most surprising animal. That a hybrid should possess more reason, memory, obstinacy, social affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length of life, than either of its parents, seems to indicate that art has here outdone nature.\"\nThe mule inherits from its sire the traits of intelligence, sure-footedness, toughness, endurance, disposition, and natural cautiousness. From its dam it inherits speed, conformation, and agility. Mules are reputed to exhibit a higher cognitive intelligence than their parent species, but robust scientific evidence to back up these claims is lacking. Preliminary data exist from at least two evidence-based studies, but they rely on &lt;a href=\"sample%20size\"&gt;a limited set of specialized cognitive tests and a small number of subjects&lt;/a&gt;. Mules are generally taller at the shoulder than donkeys and have better endurance than horses, although a lower top speed.\nHandlers of &lt;a href=\"working%20animal\"&gt;working animal&lt;/a&gt;s generally find mules preferable to horses; mules show more patience under the pressure of heavy weights, and their skin is harder and less sensitive than that of horses, rendering them more capable of resisting sun and rain. Their hooves are harder than horses', and they show a natural resistance to disease and insects. Many North American farmers with &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; soil found mules superior as plow animals.\nColor and size variety.\nMules occur in a variety of configurations, sizes, and colors; minis weigh under to over . The coats of mules have the same varieties as those of horses. Common colors are &lt;a href=\"sorrel%20%28horse%29\"&gt;sorrel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bay%20%28horse%29\"&gt;bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"black%20%28horse%29\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"gray%20%28horse%29\"&gt;grey&lt;/a&gt;. Less common are &lt;a href=\"white%20%28horse%29\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"roan%20%28horse%29\"&gt;roan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"palomino\"&gt;palomino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dun%20gene\"&gt;dun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"buckskin%20%28horse%29\"&gt;buckskin&lt;/a&gt;. Least common are &lt;a href=\"pinto%20horse\"&gt;paint&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"tobiano\"&gt;tobiano&lt;/a&gt; patterns. Mules from &lt;a href=\"Appaloosa\"&gt;Appaloosa&lt;/a&gt; mares produce wildly colored mules, much like their Appaloosa horse relatives, but with even wilder skewed colors. The Appaloosa color is produced by a complex of genes known as the &lt;a href=\"leopard%20complex\"&gt;leopard complex&lt;/a&gt;. Mares homozygous for this gene complex bred to any color donkey will produce a spotted mule.\nDistribution and use.\nMules historically were used by armies to transport supplies, occasionally as mobile firing platforms for smaller cannons, and to pull heavier field guns with wheels over mountainous trails such as in Afghanistan during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Anglo-Afghan%20War\"&gt;Second Anglo-Afghan War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization%20of%20the%20United%20Nations\"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt; reports that &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; was the top market for mules in 2003, closely followed by &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and many Central and South American nations.\nFertility.\nMules and hinnies have 63 &lt;a href=\"chromosome\"&gt;chromosome&lt;/a&gt;s, a mixture of the horse's 64 and the donkey's 62. The different structure and number usually prevents the chromosomes from pairing up properly and creating successful embryos, rendering most mules &lt;a href=\"infertile\"&gt;infertile&lt;/a&gt;.\nA few mare mules have produced offspring when mated with a purebred horse or donkey. &lt;a href=\"Herodotus\"&gt;Herodotus&lt;/a&gt; gives an account of such an event as an ill omen of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Persian%20invasion%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Xerxes' invasion of Greece&lt;/a&gt; in 480 BC: \"There happened also a portent of another kind while he was still at Sardis\u2014a mule brought forth young and gave birth to a mule\" (Herodotus \"&lt;a href=\"Histories%20%28Herodotus%29\"&gt;The Histories&lt;/a&gt;\" 7:57), and a mule's giving birth was a frequently recorded portent in antiquity, although scientific writers also doubted whether the thing was really possible (see e.g. &lt;a href=\"Aristotle\"&gt;Aristotle&lt;/a&gt;, \"Historia animalium\", 6.24; &lt;a href=\"Varro\"&gt;Varro&lt;/a&gt;, \"De re rustica\", 2.1.28).\nAs of October 2002, only 60 cases of mules birthing foals had been documented since 1527. In China in 2001, a mare mule produced a filly. In &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; in early 2002 and &lt;a href=\"Colorado\"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, mare mules produced colts. Blood and hair samples from the Colorado birth verified that the mother was indeed a mule and the foal was indeed her offspring.\nA 1939 article in the \"Journal of Heredity\" describes two offspring of a fertile mare mule named \"Old Bec\", which was owned at the time by &lt;a href=\"Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University\"&gt;Texas A&amp;M University&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1920s. One of the foals was a female, sired by a jack. Unlike her mother, she was sterile. The other, sired by a five-gaited &lt;a href=\"American%20Saddlebred\"&gt;Saddlebred&lt;/a&gt; stallion, exhibited no characteristics of any donkey. That horse, a stallion, was bred to several mares, which gave birth to live foals that showed no characteristics of the donkey. In a more recent instance, a group from the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20University%20of%20Minas%20Gerais\"&gt;Federal University of Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt; in 1995 described a female mule that was pregnant for a seventh time, having previously produced to donkey sires two foals with the typical 63 chromsomes of mules, and to several horse stallions had produced four foals. The three of the latter available for testing each bore 64 horse-like chromosomes. These foals phenotypically resembled horses, though they bore markings absent from the sires known lineages, and one had ears noticably longer than those typical of her sire's breed. The elder two horse-like foals had proved fertile at the time of publication, with their progeny being typical of horses.\nHistory.\nThe mule is \"the most common and oldest known manmade hybrid.\" It was likely invented in ancient times in what is now Turkey. They were common in Egypt by 3000 BCE. &lt;a href=\"Homer\"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt; noted their arrival in Asia Minor in the \"&lt;a href=\"Iliad\"&gt;Iliad&lt;/a&gt;\" in 800 BCE. Mules are mentioned in the Bible (Samuel 2:18:9, Kings 1:18:5, Zacharia 14:15, Psalms 32:9). Christopher Columbus brought mules to the New World. &lt;a href=\"George%20Washington\"&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; is known as the father of the American mule due to his success in producing 57 mules at his home at Mount Vernon. At the time, mules were not common in the United States, but Washington understood their value, as they were \"more docile than donkeys and cheap to maintain.\" In the 19th century, they were used in various capacities as draft animals - on farms, especially where clay made the soil slippery and sticky; pulling canal boats; and famously for pulling, often in teams of 20 or more animals, wagonloads of &lt;a href=\"borax\"&gt;borax&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Death%20Valley%23History\"&gt;Death Valley&lt;/a&gt;, California from 1883 to 1889. The wagons were among the largest ever pulled by draft animals, designed to carry 10 &lt;a href=\"short%20ton\"&gt;short ton&lt;/a&gt;s (9 metric tons) of borax ore at a time.\nModern usage.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, widespread usage of mules declined in industrialized countries. The use of mules for farming and transportation of agricultural products largely gave way to steam-, then gasoline-powered, &lt;a href=\"tractors\"&gt;tractors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"truck\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMules are still used extensively to transport cargo in rugged, roadless regions, such as the large &lt;a href=\"wilderness\"&gt;wilderness&lt;/a&gt; areas of California's &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29\"&gt;Sierra Nevada&lt;/a&gt; mountains or the &lt;a href=\"Pasayten%20Wilderness\"&gt;Pasayten Wilderness&lt;/a&gt; of northern Washington. Commercial pack mules are used recreationally, such as to supply mountaineering base camps, and also to supply trail-building and maintenance crews, and backcountry footbridge-building crews. As of July 2014, at least 16 commercial mule &lt;a href=\"pack%20station\"&gt;pack station&lt;/a&gt;s are in business in the Sierra Nevada. The Angeles chapter of the &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Club\"&gt;Sierra Club&lt;/a&gt; has a mule pack section that organizes hiking trips with supplies carried by mules.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War\"&gt;Soviet\u2013Afghan War&lt;/a&gt;, mules were used to carry weapons and supplies over Afghanistan's rugged terrain to the\" &lt;a href=\"mujahideen\"&gt;mujahideen&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAbout 3.5\u00a0million donkeys and mules are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.\nMule trains have been part of working portions of transportation links as recently as 2005 by the &lt;a href=\"World%20Food%20Programme\"&gt;World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrains.\nA \"mule train\" is a connected or unconnected line of pack mules, usually carrying cargo. Because of the mule's ability to carry at least as much as a horse, its trait of being sure-footed along with tolerance of poorer, coarser foods and abilities to tolerate arid terrains, mule trains were common caravan organized means of &lt;a href=\"animal-power\"&gt;animal-power&lt;/a&gt;ed &lt;a href=\"bulk%20transport\"&gt;bulk transport&lt;/a&gt; back into preclassical times. In many climate and circumstantial instances, an equivalent string of pack horses would have to carry more fodder and sacks of high-energy grains such as &lt;a href=\"oat\"&gt;oat&lt;/a&gt;s, so could carry less cargo. In modern times, strings of sure-footed mules have been used to carry riders in dangerous but scenic backcountry terrain such as excursions into canyons.\nPack trains were instrumental in opening up the American West, as they could carry up to , survive on rough forage, did not require feed, and could operate in the arid, higher elevations of the Rockies, serving as the main cargo means to the west from Missouri during the heyday of the &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20fur%20trade\"&gt;North American fur trade&lt;/a&gt;. Their use antedated the move west into the Rockies as colonial Americans sent out the first fur trappers and explorers past the Appalachians, who were then followed west by high risk-taking settlers by the 1750s (such as &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Boone\"&gt;Daniel Boone&lt;/a&gt;), who led an increasing flood of emigrants who began pushing west over into southern New York, and through the &lt;a href=\"gaps%20of%20the%20Allegheny\"&gt;gaps of the Allegheny&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20Country\"&gt;Ohio Country&lt;/a&gt; (the lands of western &lt;a href=\"colony%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;Province of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Province of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;), into Tennessee and Kentucky before and especially after the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolution\"&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nClone.\nIn 2003, researchers at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Idaho\"&gt;University of Idaho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Utah%20State%20University\"&gt;Utah State University&lt;/a&gt; produced the first mule &lt;a href=\"cloning\"&gt;clone&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Project%20Idaho\"&gt;Project Idaho&lt;/a&gt;. The research team included Gordon Woods, professor of &lt;a href=\"animal%20science\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Veterinary%20medicine\"&gt;veterinary science&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Idaho; Kenneth L. White, Utah State University professor of animal science; and Dirk Vanderwall, University of Idaho assistant professor of animal and veterinary science. The baby mule, &lt;a href=\"Idaho%20Gem\"&gt;Idaho Gem&lt;/a&gt;, was born May 4. It was the first clone of a hybrid animal. Veterinary examinations of the foal and its surrogate mother showed them to be in good health soon after birth. The foal's DNA comes from a fetal cell culture first established in 1998 at the University of Idaho."
