    "text": "Protet was a &lt;a href=\"protected%20cruiser\"&gt;protected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; built in the 1890s, the second and final member of the . The \"Catinat\"-&lt;a href=\"ship%20class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; cruisers were ordered as part of a construction program directed at strengthening the fleet's cruiser force at a time the country was concerned with the growing naval threat of the Italian and German fleets. The new cruisers were intended to serve with the main fleet and overseas in the &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;French colonial empire&lt;/a&gt;. \"Protet\" was armed with a &lt;a href=\"main%20battery\"&gt;main battery&lt;/a&gt; of four &lt;a href=\"Canon%20de%20164%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201893\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt;, was protected by an armor &lt;a href=\"deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; that was thick, and was capable of steaming at a top speed of up to .\nAfter entering service in 1899, \"Protet\" was sent to the Pacific Ocean for a lengthy deployment; she was to spend the majority of her active career in the region. While there, she helped suppress a fire in the United States in 1900 and protected French interests in Colombia during a conflict in the country in 1901. The ship was eventually recalled to France in 1905. She was later assigned to the Gunnery School as a &lt;a href=\"training%20ship\"&gt;training ship&lt;/a&gt; in 1908 before being struck from the &lt;a href=\"naval%20register\"&gt;naval register&lt;/a&gt; in 1910 and thereafter &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\nIn response to a war scare with Italy in the late 1880s, the French Navy embarked on a major construction program in 1890 to counter the threat of the Italian fleet and that of Italy's ally Germany. The plan called for a total of seventy cruisers for use in home waters and overseas in the &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;French colonial empire&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Catinat\" &lt;a href=\"ship%20class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; was ordered as part of the program, and they were based on the earlier .\n\"Protet\" was &lt;a href=\"long%20between%20perpendiculars\"&gt;long between perpendiculars&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . She &lt;a href=\"displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; . Her crew numbered 400\u00a0officers and enlisted men. The ship's propulsion system consisted of a pair of &lt;a href=\"triple-expansion%20steam%20engine\"&gt;triple-expansion steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s driving two &lt;a href=\"screw%20propeller\"&gt;screw propeller&lt;/a&gt;s. Steam was provided by sixteen coal-burning &lt;a href=\"Belleville%20boiler\"&gt;Belleville-type&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"water-tube%20boiler\"&gt;water-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s that were ducted into two &lt;a href=\"funnel%20%28ship%29\"&gt;funnels&lt;/a&gt;. Her machinery was rated to produce for a top speed of . She had a cruising range of at a speed of ; at maximum speed, this fell to .\nThe ship was armed with a &lt;a href=\"main%20battery\"&gt;main battery&lt;/a&gt; of four &lt;a href=\"Canon%20de%20164%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201893\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt;. They were placed in individual &lt;a href=\"sponson\"&gt;sponson&lt;/a&gt;s clustered &lt;a href=\"amidships\"&gt;amidships&lt;/a&gt;, two guns per &lt;a href=\"Broadside%20%28naval%29\"&gt;broadside&lt;/a&gt;. These were supported by a &lt;a href=\"battleship%20secondary%20armament\"&gt;secondary battery&lt;/a&gt; of ten &lt;a href=\"Canon%20de%20100%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201891\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt;, which were carried in sponsons, &lt;a href=\"casemate\"&gt;casemate&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"pivot%20mount\"&gt;pivot mount&lt;/a&gt;s. For close-range defense against &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s, she carried ten &lt;a href=\"QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss\"&gt;3-pounder Hotchkiss guns&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"QF%201-pounder%20pom-pom\"&gt;1-pounder guns&lt;/a&gt;. She was also armed with two &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s in her &lt;a href=\"hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"waterline\"&gt;waterline&lt;/a&gt;. Armor protection consisted of a curved armor &lt;a href=\"deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; that was thick, along with plating on the &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nService history.\n\"Protet\" was built at the &lt;a href=\"Forges%20et%20Chantiers%20de%20la%20Gironde\"&gt;Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde&lt;/a&gt; shipyard near &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;; her &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; in March 1896. The ship was &lt;a href=\"ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 6 July 1898 and she was completed in February 1899. During her &lt;a href=\"sea%20trials\"&gt;sea trials&lt;/a&gt; that year, she reached a speed of from using &lt;a href=\"forced%20draft\"&gt;forced draft&lt;/a&gt;. After completing her trials later in 1899, she was &lt;a href=\"ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 20 April to replace the old &lt;a href=\"unprotected%20cruiser\"&gt;unprotected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; in the Pacific. After completing preparations by September, she sailed from &lt;a href=\"Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime\"&gt;Rochefort&lt;/a&gt; to begin a lengthy deployment to the region. The following year, she was joined there by the protected cruiser and the transport vessel . \"Protet\" was in &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; in the United States in 1900 when a fire broke out in the harbor; \"Protet\" sent men ashore to help suppress the blaze, prompting the city's mayor to send a note of thanks to the French government.\n\"Protet\" was still serving in the Naval Division of the Eastern Pacific by January 1901, which also included the &lt;a href=\"gunboat\"&gt;gunboat&lt;/a&gt; and four transport vessels. In October that year, she went to &lt;a href=\"Panama%20City\"&gt;Panama City&lt;/a&gt;, then still part of Colombia, to protect French interests during the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Days%27%20War\"&gt;Thousand Days' War&lt;/a&gt;; she met vessels from other navies, including the United States &lt;a href=\"pre-dreadnought%20battleship\"&gt;pre-dreadnought battleship&lt;/a&gt; and the British &lt;a href=\"sloop-of-war\"&gt;sloop&lt;/a&gt; . On the Caribbean side of the &lt;a href=\"isthmus%20of%20Panama\"&gt;isthmus of Panama&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Col%C3%B3n%2C%20Panama\"&gt;Col\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, the French cruiser and the United States gunboat also awaited developments in the conflict. In December, \"Protet\" steamed north to the United States' &lt;a href=\"Mare%20Island%20Naval%20Shipyard\"&gt;Mare Island Naval Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; in California to replenish coal and supplies.\nThe ship remained on the Pacific station in 1902. In January, she returned to Panama City, where she met the British cruiser and the United States cruiser . \"Protet\" and \"Amphion\" remained there through June. By 1903, the station had been reduced to \"Protet\" and a gunboat. \"Protet\" remained on station in the Pacific in 1904, along with the gunboat \"Z\u00e9l\u00e9e\" and one transport &lt;a href=\"aviso\"&gt;aviso&lt;/a&gt;. \"Protet\" continued to operate in the Pacific in 1905, and in January, she stopped in San Francisco to take on coal. Later that year, her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the Pacific to relieve \"Protet\", allowing her to return to France. In 1908, \"Protet\" was attached to the Gunnery Training School, along with the &lt;a href=\"armored%20cruiser\"&gt;armored cruiser&lt;/a&gt; . The ship was struck from the &lt;a href=\"naval%20register\"&gt;naval register&lt;/a&gt; in 1910 and she was thereafter &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"scrap\"&gt;scrap&lt;/a&gt;."
