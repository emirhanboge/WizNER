    "text": "Friedrich L\u00fctge (21 October 1901 \u2013 25 August 1968) was a German economist, &lt;a href=\"Social%20history\"&gt;social historian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Economic%20history\"&gt;economic historian&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe taught at the &lt;a href=\"HHL%20Leipzig%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Management\"&gt;Leipzig Graduate School of Management (HHL)&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Leipzig\"&gt;University of Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; between 1940 and 1947, then moving on to the &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Maximilian%20University%20of%20Munich\"&gt;Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich&lt;/a&gt; where he taught till a few months before he died. Through his research work between 1949 and 1968 he exercised a great influence on the understanding of economic history in West Germany. Together with &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Abel\"&gt;Wilhelm Abel&lt;/a&gt; and he contributed decisively to research into in &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. He was instrumental in ensuring that social and economic history emerged as an alternative strand to the prism of &lt;a href=\"historical%20materialism\"&gt;historical materialism&lt;/a&gt; that was mainstream in many German universities during this period. From this followed an insistence in his economic research that the subject needs to be studied not simply from a theoretical quasi-mathematical standpoint, but also empirically and in the context of broader historical considerations.\nLife and works.\nProvenance and early years.\nFriedrich Karl L\u00fctge was born into a &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; family at the start of the twentieth century at &lt;a href=\"Wernigerode\"&gt;Wernigerode&lt;/a&gt;, a midsized town located in the &lt;a href=\"Harz\"&gt;Harz Mountains&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Hanover\"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halle%20%28Saale%29\"&gt;Halle&lt;/a&gt;. He was the older of twin brothers. There were also two younger siblings. His father was a captain in the German merchant navy who was much involved with &lt;a href=\"Kamerun\"&gt;Kamerun&lt;/a&gt; trade, but died in 1905. As a child Friedrich L\u00fctge suffered from a spinal disease which confined him to bed for three years. On 23 September 1918, while still at school he found himself recruited into an &lt;a href=\"Regiment\"&gt;infantry regiment&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Fahnenjunker\"&gt;junior officer&lt;/a&gt; (\"Fahnenjunker\"), but by this time the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; was nearly over and he was never sent into the fighting of it. However, in February 1919 he found himself taken into the \"&lt;a href=\"Freikorps\"&gt;Freikorps&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"volunteer corps\") of in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, and he was involved in the putting down of the &lt;a href=\"Spartacist%20uprising\"&gt;Spartacus uprising&lt;/a&gt;. It was only in 1921 that he passed his &lt;a href=\"Abitur\"&gt;Abitur (school leaving exams)&lt;/a&gt; which opened the way to university-level education.\nIn 1921 L\u00fctge enrolled at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Freiburg\"&gt;University of Freiburg&lt;/a&gt; where he studied economics (\"Volkswirtschaft\") and history on a course directed by . That was followed by a term at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Marburg\"&gt;University of Marburg&lt;/a&gt; where he was taught by &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Brackmann\"&gt;Albert Brackmann&lt;/a&gt; and . He concluded his student studies at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Jena\"&gt;University of Jena&lt;/a&gt; where he was supervised for his doctorate by . Importantly for L\u00fctge 's subsequent academic career, it was Gutmann who awakened his interest in . His doctoral dissertation concerned \"The Liberation of the Peasantry in the County of Wernigerode\" (\"Die Bauernbefreiung in der Grafschaft Wernigerode\"). He was obliged to in order to support himself and his widowed mother.\nBriefly, between 15 October and 16 November 1923, he belonged to the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Reichswehr\"&gt;Black Reichswehr&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUnusually, on 1 December 1928 Friedrich L\u00fctge was awarded a second doctorate. This time his dissertation concerned the history of the book trade in Jena, including the impact of the invention of printing. The work was supervised by Georg Menz. While working on this doctorate he was also employed in &lt;a href=\"Jena\"&gt;Jena&lt;/a&gt; as a private researcher by the economist-statistician &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Elster\"&gt;Ludwig Elster&lt;/a&gt;. Projects on which he worked with Elster included the fourth edition of the \"W\u00f6rterbuch der Volkswirtschaftslehre\" (\"Lexicon of Applied Economics\") and the \"\" (\"Yearbooks of National Economy and Statistics\"). He also authored a celebratory booklet in respect of the fiftieth anniversary of the : research for this commission supported and influenced the doctorate on which he was working at the same time. In 1929 he obtained a permanent position with as a literary editor and academic researcher. At Fischer he was entrusted with producing a number of works, mostly concerned with and &lt;a href=\"Economic%20History\"&gt;Economic History&lt;/a&gt;\nIt was also in 1929 that Friedrich L\u00fctge married Eva Buchfink, a daughter of General Ernst Buchfinck. The marriage produced one recorded son and two daughters.\nJena in the 1930s.\nDuring the early 1930s he pursued his career with the publisher in parallel with his academic researches, publishing several essays on social policy and agricultural history. In 1934 he published a significant piece of work in which he pointed out that in central Germany as early as the &lt;a href=\"early%20modern%20period\"&gt;early modern period&lt;/a&gt; a form of &lt;a href=\"Manorialism\"&gt;landlordship and tenancy&lt;/a&gt; existed which was based not on &lt;a href=\"Socage\"&gt;service obligation&lt;/a&gt;, but simply the handing over of produce. That contrasted with he versions of &lt;a href=\"manorialism\"&gt;manorialism&lt;/a&gt; that was normal in the northern and southern parts of &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20empire\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. He followed this up in 1937 with a broadened study of the German agrarian economy, taking his research back to the middle ages and, in particular, to the &lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20dynasty\"&gt;Carolingian era&lt;/a&gt;. This meant that there had been fundamental regional variations in land tenure arrangements in Germany far earlier than had hitherto been believed. That same year he saw to the posthumous publication of the \"Outline of the History of the German Rural Economy in the Middle Ages\" (\"Geschichte der deutschen Landwirtschaft des Mittelalters in ihren Grundz\u00fcgen\") by his former tutor, Georg von Below, using manuscripts that von Below had left behind when he died ten years earlier.\n1933 was the year of the &lt;a href=\"Machtergreifung\"&gt;National Socialist take-over&lt;/a&gt;. It was also the year in which L\u00fctge joined the &lt;a href=\"German%20National%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;German National People's Party&lt;/a&gt; (\"Deutschnationale Volkspartei\", DNVP), though this party had dissolved itself by the end of that year. He also had close connections with the anti-&lt;a href=\"Nazi%20party\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Confessing%20Church\"&gt;Confessing Church&lt;/a&gt;. He would later insist that his various longstanding memberships of associations connected with the army, notably \"&lt;a href=\"Der%20Stahlhelm%2C%20Bund%20der%20Frontsoldaten\"&gt;Der Stahlhelm&lt;/a&gt;\", afforded him a measure of independence in his interactions with the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;National Socialist state&lt;/a&gt;. When \"Der Stahlhelm\" was forcibly merged into the party's own &lt;a href=\"Sturmabteilung\"&gt;Sturmabteilung (SA)&lt;/a&gt; paramilitary organisation, L\u00fctge was one of many who responded by resigning from \"Der Stahlhelm\". Unlike many of the scholars who preserved their university careers through the Hitler years, L\u00fctge never found it necessary to join &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Party\"&gt;The Party&lt;/a&gt; itself. Nevertheless, he did join the party's &lt;a href=\"National%20Socialist%20People%27s%20Welfare\"&gt;\"People's Welfare\"&lt;/a&gt; (\"Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt\", NSV) organisation in 1934. In 1937 he joined the party's &lt;a href=\"National%20Socialist%20German%20Lecturers%20League\"&gt;\"Teachers' League\"&lt;/a&gt; (\"Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund\", NSDDB). And in 1944 he added the \"\" (\"Old Men's League\"), a party organisation for university academics, to his portfolio of memberships.\nIn January 1936 he received his &lt;a href=\"habilitation\"&gt;habilitation&lt;/a&gt; degree from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Jena\"&gt;University of Jena&lt;/a&gt;, which opened the way to a university teaching career in respect of and &lt;a href=\"Economic%20history\"&gt;Economic history&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the amount of relevant research work that he had already undertaken he was awarded the habilitation without any requirement to write a habilitation-dissertation. The faculty deemed the two dissertations he had already completed in respect of his doctorates sufficient. Receipt of his &lt;a href=\"Habilitation%23Process\"&gt;teaching permit&lt;/a&gt; (\"venia legendi\") was delayed till the next year due to differences with government authorities. There is speculation that he only received it at all because of his longstanding personal friendship with the nationally respected economist who at this stage was still a committed &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Party\"&gt;party member&lt;/a&gt; (though he would later be executed by hanging). In 1937 L\u00fctge began working as a teacher in his disciplines at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Jena\"&gt;Jena University&lt;/a&gt; Law and Economics faculties.\nLeipzig in the 1940s.\nIn 1940 L\u00fctge was offered and accepted a junior professorship in economics (\"Volkswirtschaft\"), with a particular focus on at the &lt;a href=\"HHL%20Leipzig%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Management\"&gt;\"Handelshochschule Leipzig\"&lt;/a&gt; (HHL; \"Commercial Academy\") \u2013 as it was known at that time, in &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;. He had already been taking a quasi-scientific approach to the housing issues which was at the time innovative. His specialities included housing-market pricing and statistics. In 1940, the year of his appointment, he was in a position to publish a systematic introduction to , which was republished in 1949. it can be seen as the first comprehensive &lt;a href=\"Monograph\"&gt;academic monograph&lt;/a&gt; on the subject. He was conscripted into the &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; in August 1941, but was released on health grounds in May 1943 after being assessed as unsuitable for service on account of a spinal condition. He returned to the &lt;a href=\"HHL%20Leipzig%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Management\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; and was promoted to a full professorship. Jointly with he took on responsibility for the annual production of the \"\" (\"Yearbooks of National Economy and Statistics\"). The compendium was banned in 1944 but returned, still produced by L\u00fctge and Preise, in 1949.\n&lt;a href=\"End%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe\"&gt;War ended&lt;/a&gt; in May 1945 and the western two thirds of what had been Germany was divided into four &lt;a href=\"Allied-occupied%20Germany\"&gt;military occupation zones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; had been liberated from National Socialism in April 1945 by the &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"69th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt;, but a different division of Germany had already &lt;a href=\"Yalta%20Conference\"&gt;been agreed&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Allied%20leaders%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;leaders&lt;/a&gt; of the victorious powers whereby Leipzig should &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Military%20Administration%20in%20Germany\"&gt;be administered&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20occupation%20zone\"&gt;Soviet occupation zone&lt;/a&gt;. The American military commanders agreed that Friedrich L\u00fctge, as a \"non-party comrade\" and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Confessing%20Church\"&gt;anti-Nazi Confessing church&lt;/a&gt; should be appointed post-war &lt;a href=\"Rector%20%28academia%29\"&gt;rector&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Handelshochschule Leipzig\". There were additional curatorial responsibilities. When the American troops withdrew from Leipzig in July 1945 the Soviet commanders who moved in were content to confirm his appointment. In 1946 the academy was merged into the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Leipzig\"&gt;University&lt;/a&gt; Faculty for Economics and Social Sciences and L\u00fctge, now on the Leipzig university payroll, was appointed dean.\nL\u00fctge was no fan of &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;Communism&lt;/a&gt;. He characterised the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Party\"&gt;National Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; as \"warring brothers from the same root\" (\"feindliche Br\u00fcder des gleichen Stammes\") He therefore did what he could to resist state mandated appointments of party-line goal oriented Marxist professors to his faculty. That led to accusations that he was trying to block denazification and to protect Nazis. &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Leipzig\"&gt;The university&lt;/a&gt; nominated him to take over as dean of their new social sciences faculty but the (\"Deutsche Verwaltung f\u00fcr Volksbildung\") then rejected the appointment because of his political stance. Before his position could become any more difficult, in September 1946 L\u00fctge accepted a chair in political economics at the &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Maximilian%20University%20of%20Munich\"&gt;Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich&lt;/a&gt; and relocated to the US occupation zone (after May 1949 part of &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt;) to take up his new position. The Munich job also came with directorship of the Economic History Seminar that had been created at the university by back in the 1920s.\nPostwar Munich.\nFriedrich L\u00fctge took up his teaching chair at Munich in 1946 or 1947. The next year his colleague , &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Maximilian%20University%20of%20Munich\"&gt;Munich's&lt;/a&gt; Professor of Economic History, left to take up a new position and L\u00fctge took on his former colleague's discipline, now in charge of both the Institute and that of the university Institute for Economic History. Meanwhile, in the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20occupation%20zone\"&gt;Soviet occupation zone&lt;/a&gt; (relaunched in October 1949 as the &lt;a href=\"Group%20of%20Soviet%20Forces%20in%20Germany\"&gt;Soviet sponsored&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"German%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;German Democratic Republic / East Germany)&lt;/a&gt;) L\u00fctge's 1940 book \"Kriegsprobleme der Wohnungswirtschaft\" (\"War Problems of Settlement and Housing\") was consigned to the official (\"Liste der auszusondernden Literatur\").\nAlongside his duties at &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Maximilian%20University%20of%20Munich\"&gt;the university&lt;/a&gt; he also taught at the &lt;a href=\"Technical%20University%20of%20Munich\"&gt;Technical University of Munich&lt;/a&gt; and at the city's then separate &lt;a href=\"Bavarian%20School%20of%20Public%20Policy\"&gt;University for Politics Munich&lt;/a&gt; (\"Hochschule f\u00fcr Politik M\u00fcnchen\"). That was the context in which his 1948 book \"Einf\u00fchrung in die Lehre vom Gelde\" (\"Introduction to the Doctrine of Money\") appeared. He had already, while still at Leipzig, highlighted the unique nature of historical &lt;a href=\"Manorialism\"&gt;landlord and tenant relationships&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1949 he published the resulting study under the title \"Die bayerische Grundherrschaft \u2013 Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Agrarverfassung Altbayerns im 16.\u201318. Jahrhundert\" (\"Bavarian Manorialism \u2013 Investigations into the agrarian constitutional structures in old Bavaria from sixteenth to eighteenth centuries\"). In addition to these agrarian historical themes, L\u00fctge's postwar research scope covered trade and commerce, notably in protestant &lt;a href=\"Nuremberg\"&gt;Nuremberg&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe also re-evaluated conventional &lt;a href=\"Periodization\"&gt;definitions of western historical periods&lt;/a&gt; through the prisms of economic and agrarian history, both in writing and in lectures, which gave rise to lively discussions between experts. In 1949 &lt;a href=\"Deutscher%20Historikertag\"&gt;German Historians' Day&lt;/a&gt; took place at &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; and L\u00fctge took the opportunity to set out his thesis that the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Death\"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt; which reached Europe between 1346 and 1350, and the ensuing changes in economic and political power balances that ensued as a result of depopulation, made 1350 a much more plausible starting point for \"&lt;a href=\"Early%20modern%20period\"&gt;Modern history&lt;/a&gt;\" than 1500 which then (as now) was widely \u2013 often unquestioningly \u2013 identified as the starting point for the modern era in European history. The next year he set out the contention in greater detail in the newly redesigned and relaunched \"\" (\"Yearbooks of National Economy and Statistics\"). He challenged another historians' shibboleth in 1958 when he argued that the decades directly preceding the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt; had not been a period of slow decline, marked by a succession of poor harvests in Europe, as widely believed, but that it was only the outbreak of hostilities in 1618 that put an end to several decades of dynamic economic development.\n (\"settlement and housing\") was a topic that continued to interest him during his Munich years. L\u00fctge was a member of an \"Expert Advisory Committee\" to the , and in 1949 published a new edition of his introduction to settlement and housing. Then in 1957 he authored a further contribution titled \"Die Wohnungs- und Siedlungswirtschaft in der Konjunktur\" (\"Housing and urban development and the economic cycle\").\nIn 1960 he received an invitation, which in the end he turned down, to take a professorship in Economic History at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cologne\"&gt;University of Cologne&lt;/a&gt;. This triggered a negotiation with &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Maximilian%20University%20of%20Munich\"&gt;his own university&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; which led to a re-assignment of teaching responsibilities that corresponded more closely with the reality of what was already happening. At the same time his \"Seminar for Economic History\" was extended in scope and elevated in status, becoming the university \"Institute for Social and Economic History\".\nIn 1967 he published in a single volume a synthesis from his various regional studies concerning German from the &lt;a href=\"early%20middle%20ages\"&gt;early middle ages&lt;/a&gt; till the \"\" (liberation of the peasantry) in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This appeared as Volume 3 of the \"Deutsche Agrargeschichte\" (\"German Agrarian History\") series produced by (which would eventually extend to 40 volumes). Back in 1952 he had already published \"Deutsche Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte\" (\"German Social and Economic History\") which provides a multi-faceted overview of his entire research scope, and a widely used textbook which in some ways represents his most important contribution to historiography. New reworked editions appeared in 1960 and 1966.\nIn 1967/68 Friedrich L\u00fctge succeeded in obtaining funding for a second teaching chair in Economic and Social History at &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Maximilian%20University%20of%20Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;. was invited to fill it. Friedrich L\u00fctge himself was by this point seriously ill. He died on 25 August 1968. He was succeeded at Munich by &lt;a href=\"Knut%20Borchardt\"&gt;Knut Borchardt&lt;/a&gt;.\nMemberships and celebration.\nFrom 1955 Friedrich L\u00fctge was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Bavarian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20and%20Humanities\"&gt;Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, in 1966 he became a corresponding member of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Academies%20for%20Science%20and%20the%20Arts%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. At the Munich academy he initiated the establishment of a commission for social and economic history, the committee of which he then chaired. On 18 February 1961 the \"Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte\" (GSWG; \"Society for Social and Economic History\") was founded. L\u00fctge was key to its creation. Till his death he served as its first chairman. Since 2005 the GSWG has awarded a Friedrich L\u00fctge Prize every two years \"for outstanding dissertations on Social and Economic History\". L\u00fctge also headed up the Economic History committee of the &lt;a href=\"Verein%20f%C3%BCr%20Socialpolitik\"&gt;German Economic Association&lt;/a&gt; (\"Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik\") between 1958 and 1962.\nProducer-editor / Publisher.\nIn 1943 L\u00fctge teamed up with to launch the \"Quellen und Forschungen zur Agrargeschichte\" (\"Sources and Research in Agrarian History\") series at . The times were not propitious, but after the war, joined by &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Abel\"&gt;Wilhelm Abel&lt;/a&gt;, they made a success of the initiative. At the same publishing house L\u00fctge launched another series, \"Forschungen zur Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte\" \"Researches into Social and Economic History\") in 1959.\nAdditionally, from the last part of 1943, together with he became co-producer of the annual ' (\"Yearbooks of National Economy and Statistics\"), on which he had previously worked under the direction of , securing the publication's future through a difficult period. After Preiser died in August 1967, L\u00fctge became sole producer of it, but his illness forced him out in May 1968. He seriously considered renaming the \"Jahrb\u00fccher\" as \"Jahrb\u00fccher f\u00fcr National\u00f6konomie und Wirtschaftsgeschichte\" (\"Yearbooks of National Economy and Economic History\") in order more accurately to reflect the interdisciplinary approach taken under his stewardship, but that name change never happened. In 1953 he also became one of the co-producers of the ' (\"Journal for Agrarian History and Sociology\")."
