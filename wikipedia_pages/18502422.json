    "text": "Though mentioned in German literature in the 19th century, the history of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Germany () begins in the early 20th century when two emigrants to the United States returned on prolonged visits to &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; bringing their newfound religion. The first &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Local%20Spiritual%20Assembly\"&gt;Local Spiritual Assembly&lt;/a&gt; was established following the conversion of enough individuals to elect one in 1908. After the visit of &lt;a href=\"%CA%BBAbdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1\"&gt;\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, then head of the religion, and the establishing of many further assemblies across Germany despite the difficulties of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, elections were called for the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed &lt;a href=\"National%20Spiritual%20Assembly\"&gt;National Spiritual Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in 1923. Banned for a time by the &lt;a href=\"Nazi\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; government and then in &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt; the religion re-organized and was soon given the task of building the first &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20House%20of%20Worship\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship&lt;/a&gt; for Europe. After &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt; the community multiplied its interests across a wide range of concerns earning the praise of German politicians. German Census data shows 5,600 registered Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Germany in 2012. The &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Religion%20Data%20Archives\"&gt;Association of Religion Data Archives&lt;/a&gt; (relying on &lt;a href=\"World%20Christian%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;World Christian Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;) estimated some 11,743 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2005 and 12,356 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2010. According to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Germany, the German Baha'i community consists of about 100 local communities and 6000 members, towards the end of 2019.\nFirst century.\nEarly phase.\n&lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20George%20Kheiralla\"&gt;Ibrahim George Kheiralla&lt;/a&gt;, an early Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed from Lebanon, traveled through Germany in 1892 attempting to making a living but found no interest in his inventions and moved on to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in February, 1893. There he managed to convert some individuals by 1895 (see &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Chase\"&gt;Thornton Chase&lt;/a&gt;.) Following these conversions, some German emigrants became Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds as well. Two in particular traveled back to Germany: Edwin Fischer and Alma Knobloch. Dr. Edwin Fischer, a dentist, had emigrated in 1878 from Germany to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, became a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed there, and then returned to &lt;a href=\"Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; in 1905. Fisher used every opportunity, including talking with his patients, to mention the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20teachings\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings&lt;/a&gt;, and in time a few Germans embraced the religion. The other German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, Alma Knobloch, became a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed in 1903, before Fischer, but arrived in Germany in 1907. This small group of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds began to organize and formed a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed &lt;a href=\"Local%20Spiritual%20Assembly\"&gt;Local Spiritual Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in 1908 and by 1909 began self-publishing pamphlets and letters and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed books including the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Words\"&gt;Hidden Words&lt;/a&gt; and a history of the religion by Knobloch. The second spiritual assembly in Germany was founded in 1909 in &lt;a href=\"Esslingen%20am%20Neckar\"&gt;Esslingen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"German%20Colony%2C%20Haifa\"&gt;German Colony&lt;/a&gt; in Palestine, as part of the worldwide , \"Frau Doktor Fallscheer\" was the &lt;a href=\"family%20physician\"&gt;family physician&lt;/a&gt; for the family of &lt;a href=\"%CA%BBAbdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1\"&gt;\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, son of the founder of the religion. Fallscheer later became a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed when she moved back to Germany by 1930. Prominent early Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed &lt;a href=\"Louis%20George%20Gregory\"&gt;Louis George Gregory&lt;/a&gt; stayed at a hotel in the &lt;a href=\"German%20Colony%2C%20Haifa\"&gt;German Colony&lt;/a&gt; in Haifa during his &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20pilgrimage\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt; to Palestine in the spring of 1911 and on his return trip visited in Germany at the request of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in the fall of 1912.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's visit to Germany.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, then head of the religion, visited Germany for 8 days in 1913, including visiting Stuttgart, Esslingen and &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Mergentheim\"&gt;Bad Mergentheim&lt;/a&gt;. During this visit he spoke to a youth group as well as a gathering of &lt;a href=\"Esperantists\"&gt;Esperantists&lt;/a&gt;. In less than a decade Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed sources state there were some 300 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Germany by the time of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's arrival. See &lt;a href=\"%CA%BBAbdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1%27s%20journeys%20to%20the%20West\"&gt;\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's journeys to the West&lt;/a&gt;.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 wrote a series of letters, or &lt;a href=\"tablets%20%28religious%29\"&gt;tablets&lt;/a&gt;, to the followers of the religion in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in 1916\u20131917; these letters were compiled together in the book \"&lt;a href=\"Tablets%20of%20the%20Divine%20Plan\"&gt;Tablets of the Divine Plan&lt;/a&gt;\". The seventh of the tablets mentioned &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an regions and was written on April 11, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919\u2014after the end of the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20flu\"&gt;Spanish flu&lt;/a&gt;. The seventh tablet was translated and presented on April 4, 1919, and published in \"&lt;a href=\"Star%20of%20the%20West%20%28Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20magazine%29\"&gt;Star of the West&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine on December 12, 1919 and mentioned Germany. He says:\n\"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.\u2026 Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands.\"\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 praised the German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds - \"individuals...endued with perceptive eyes and attentive ears\" were \"attracted to the principles of the oneness of mankind\" and treated \"all the peoples and kindreds of the earth in a spirit of concord and fellowship.\" He predicted Germany will \"surpass all other regions\" and \"lead all the nations and peoples of Europe spiritually.\" &lt;a href=\"Shoghi%20Effendi\"&gt;Shoghi Effendi&lt;/a&gt;, head of the religion after the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, continued commentary about Germany and its Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds; he wrote that during the Nazi government the German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds demonstrated that they were the \"great-hearted, indefatigable, much admired German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community\".\nWorld War I.\nAs World War I was becoming more widespread in its ramifications, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds pursued other courses of action. In 1916 a plaque was raised to honor \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's visit at Bad Mergentheim. On May 23, 1916, Austrian Franz P\u00f6llinger learned of the religion while staying in Stuttgart and on returning to &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; had a prominent role in the growth of the religion there. When the United States entered the war, individuals from there, as Fischer and Knobloch, had to leave Germany and both returned to the United States. On return to the US Fischer went to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; area and Knobloch went to New York. In a wave of anti-German sentiment (see &lt;a href=\"German%20American%20internment\"&gt;German American internment&lt;/a&gt; for similar issues a generation later) Fischer was caught up in charges of espionage for Germany which were dismissed. As Germany was allied with the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign\"&gt;Sinai and Palestine Campaign&lt;/a&gt; of World War I played an important role with the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Palestine - particularly the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29\"&gt;Battle of Megiddo&lt;/a&gt; in September 1918. As a direct result of the events of the battle, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was rescued after death threats were made against him in case the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; side was to lose (events in which &lt;a href=\"Wellesley%20Tudor%20Pole\"&gt;Wellesley Tudor Pole&lt;/a&gt; played a significant part.)\nPost-War closing.\nAfter WWI, the national Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community organized a German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Publishing Trust and in 1920 &lt;a href=\"Adelbert%20M%C3%BChlschlegel\"&gt;Adelbert M\u00fchlschlegel&lt;/a&gt; became a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, and later appointed as a &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20the%20Cause\"&gt;Hand of the Cause&lt;/a&gt;, individuals who have been considered to have achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion. He was the first of three believers who decisively influenced the German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds. As with other German emigrants who converted to the religion, Siegfried Schopflocher who was born in Germany, as an &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20Jews\"&gt;Orthodox Jew&lt;/a&gt;, sought out a wider unity and found the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith while in Canada in the summer of 1921; he was also later appointed a Hand of the Cause. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's last tablet before his death was addressed to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Stuttgart in November 1921.\nInter-war period.\nIn 1921 a new magazine \"Sun of Truth\" was first published as one of five Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed journals produced by German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds through the 1920s. It contained newly translated Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed literature and news from the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community around the world.\nIn 1923 the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed &lt;a href=\"National%20Spiritual%20Assembly\"&gt;National Spiritual Assemblies&lt;/a&gt; were elected \"where conditions are favorable and the number of the friends has grown and reached a considerable size\". Along with &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith%20in%20India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of Germany and Austria was first elected in that year. In 1925 there were 95 delegates who performed the election. A 1925 list of local Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Centers mentions no less than 26 in Germany, compared to three in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and two in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. In late 1926 and again in 1929 widely traveled &lt;a href=\"Martha%20Root\"&gt;Martha Root&lt;/a&gt; spoke in most German universities and technical colleges. Eugen Schmidt, the second of the three believers who decisively influenced the German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, became a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed and was elected a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany from 1932 for many years and served as chairman in the decisive years of re-building after World War II.\nAmong the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds to visit Germany were &lt;a href=\"Amelia%20Collins\"&gt;Amelia Collins&lt;/a&gt;, Marion Jack and Louisa Mathew Gregory, wife of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20George%20Gregory\"&gt;Louis George Gregory&lt;/a&gt;. Another Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed with links to Germany was &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Sengstacke%20Abbott\"&gt;Robert Sengstacke Abbott&lt;/a&gt; whose adoptive father was German and, through his family connection, he kept in contact with his family in Germany. In 1930 the national convention included delegates from Stuttgart, &lt;a href=\"Rostock\"&gt;Rostock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Schwerin\"&gt;Schwerin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karlsruhe\"&gt;Karlsruhe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6ppingen\"&gt;G\u00f6ppingen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bissingen%2C%20Bavaria\"&gt;Bissingen&lt;/a&gt;, and from &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;. The 1931 national assembly included four women and five men. In 1935 Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, re-organized the German community to cover Austria as well so they shared a regional national assembly.\nNazi period.\nDuring the early Nazi period Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds had general freedom; Mary Maxwell &lt;a href=\"R%C3%BAh%C3%ADyyih%20Kh%C3%A1num\"&gt;R\u00fah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num&lt;/a&gt;, before becoming wife of &lt;a href=\"Shoghi%20Effendi\"&gt;Shoghi Effendi&lt;/a&gt;, had expressed a great desire to learn Spanish. However, her plans to travel to &lt;a href=\"Second%20Spanish%20Republic\"&gt;Republican Spain&lt;/a&gt; were thwarted with the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, Mary chose to live with her cousin in &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; in 1935, a move which was endorsed by Shoghi Effendi, and he encouraged Mary to strengthen the fledgling Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community. For 18 months the young Mary assimilated herself in German culture, wearing a &lt;a href=\"dirndl\"&gt;dirndl&lt;/a&gt; and learning to speak German fluently. Whilst in Germany in 1936, Mary received an invitation from Shoghi Effendi to go on pilgrimage with her mother. Both mother and daughter accepted the invitation, and this trip culminated with Mary's marriage to the Guardian in March 1937.\n&lt;a href=\"May%20Maxwell\"&gt;May Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;, wife of &lt;a href=\"William%20Sutherland%20Maxwell\"&gt;William Sutherland Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;, was able to travel through Germany in 1936, though the plaque commemorating \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's visit had been taken down. By 1937 however, &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Himmler\"&gt;Heinrich Himmler&lt;/a&gt; signed an order disbanding the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith's institutions in Germany because of its 'international and pacifist tendencies'. In 1939 and in 1942 there were sweeping arrests of former members of the National Spiritual Assembly. In May 1944 there was a public trial in &lt;a href=\"Darmstadt\"&gt;Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt; at which Dr. Hermann Grossmann was allowed to defend the character of the religion but the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds were instead heavily fined and its institutions continued to be disbanded. However, for this service and others, Grossmann was ranked as the third of the three believers who decisively influenced the German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds.\nAfter the Nazi period.\nFollowing the fall of Nazi Germany, an American Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, John C. Eichenauer who was a &lt;a href=\"medic\"&gt;medic&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"100th%20Infantry%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;100th Infantry&lt;/a&gt; division then at &lt;a href=\"Geislingen%20an%20der%20Steige\"&gt;Geislingen&lt;/a&gt; started searching for the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community in Stuttgart. He drove through Stuttgart looking and asking for Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds and was able to find an individual by nightfall/curfew. The next day saw the first meeting of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds since their disbandment in 1937. Two other American Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, Bruce Davison and Henry Jarvis, in &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg\"&gt;Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt; respectively, also connected with the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community in Germany. At the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Germany%20since%201945\"&gt;partition of Germany&lt;/a&gt; there were about 150 German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in the American section and they became registered with the American authorities. The National Spiritual Assembly was re-elected in 1946 and by 1950 there were 14 Local Spiritual Assemblies:\nand smaller Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed communities in 27 cities.\nHowever, in Soviet controlled &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith was again disbanded in 1948. In &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt;, by 1954 there were reports of large growth in the religion, and from 1951 to 1966 &lt;a href=\"philately\"&gt;philately&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"stationery\"&gt;stationery&lt;/a&gt; and a \"&lt;a href=\"Cinderella%20stamp\"&gt;Cinderella stamp&lt;/a&gt;\" religious stationery were produced in West Germany.\nHouse of Worship.\nThe construction of the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20House%20of%20Worship\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Langenhain\"&gt;Langenhain&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, began in 1952. &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20the%20Cause\"&gt;Hand of the Cause&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amelia%20Collins\"&gt;Amelia Collins&lt;/a&gt; represented the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20International%20Community\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed International Community&lt;/a&gt; at the groundbreaking 20 November 1960. Designated as the \"Mother Temple of Europe\", it was dedicated in 1964 by Hand of the Cause &lt;a href=\"Ruhiyyih%20Khanum\"&gt;Ruhiyyih Khanum&lt;/a&gt;, representing the first elected &lt;a href=\"Universal%20House%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Universal House of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment in West Germany.\nBy 1963 the list of local assemblies was:\nIsolated Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds were found in an additional 86 locations.\n&lt;a href=\"West%20German\"&gt;West German&lt;/a&gt; Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds were given the responsibility of trying to strengthen the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; in 1963. During the 1960s and 1970s, a small number of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds visited the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; as tourists but no attempt was made to promulgate the religion. In 1986 Friedo and Shole Z\u00f6lzer and Karen Reitz from Germany traveled into the Soviet Union but remained for only short periods of time. Continuing in the 1980s and into the 1990s the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Esperanto-League\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Esperanto-League&lt;/a&gt; began to prosper especially in West Germany. One reason behind this was that Esperanto had acquired the reputation of being an \"entrance ticket\" to countries behind the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Curtain\"&gt;Iron Curtain&lt;/a&gt;, countries to which the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith had had little access during the preceding decades (the first post-World War II Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed know to pioneer to Russia was in 1979.)\nReunion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt; in 1989-91 the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Federal Constitutional Court of Germany&lt;/a&gt; handed down a judgment affirming the status of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith as a religion in Germany. Continued development of youth oriented programs included the Diversity Dance Theater (see &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20DeGruy\"&gt;Oscar DeGruy&lt;/a&gt;) which traveled to &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt; in February 1997. &lt;a href=\"Udo%20Schaefer\"&gt;Udo Schaefer&lt;/a&gt; et al.'s 2001 \"Making the Crooked Straight\" was written to refute a &lt;a href=\"polemic\"&gt;polemic&lt;/a&gt; supported by the &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Church%20in%20Germany%23Institutes%20and%20important%20offices%20of%20the%20EKD\"&gt;Evangelical Church in Germany&lt;/a&gt; written in 1981. Since its publication the Evangelical Church in Germany has revised its own relationship to the German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Community. Former member of the federal parliament &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Ulrich%20von%20Weizsaecker\"&gt;Ernst Ulrich von Weizsaecker&lt;/a&gt; commended the ideas of the German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community on social integration, which were published in a statement in 1998, and Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Helmut%20Kohl\"&gt;Helmut Kohl&lt;/a&gt; sent a congratulatory message to the 1992 ceremony marking the 100th Anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"Ascension%20of%20Bah%C3%A1%CA%BCu%27ll%C3%A1h\"&gt;Ascension of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h&lt;/a&gt;.\nMultiplying interests.\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in &lt;a href=\"Socio-economic%20development%20%28Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%29\"&gt;socio-economic development&lt;/a&gt; beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the &lt;a href=\"Universal%20House%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Universal House of Justice&lt;/a&gt; dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20teachings\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings&lt;/a&gt;, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Nearing the century mark of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community in Germany, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Germany have begun efforts in diverse fields of interest. An estimated 500,000 people visited the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed pavilion at the &lt;a href=\"Hanover\"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Expo%202000\"&gt;Expo 2000&lt;/a&gt;. The 170 square-meter Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed exhibit, hosted by the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20International%20Community\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed International Community&lt;/a&gt; and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of Germany, featured development projects in &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; that illustrated the importance of grassroots capacity-building, the advancement of women, and moral and spiritual values in the process of social and economic development. The German community organized a national Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Choir in 2001 which tours various events in Germany and Europe. In 2002 the director of the Ernst Lange-Institute for Ecumenical Studies held a meeting under the auspices of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Ministry%20for%20Environment%2C%20Nature%20Conservation%20and%20Nuclear%20Safety%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;German Federal Environment Ministry&lt;/a&gt; titled \"Orientation dialogue of religions represented in Germany on environmental politics with reference to the climate issue\" for the interfaith community including the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds. In 2005 former federal Minister of the Interior, &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Schily\"&gt;Otto Schily&lt;/a&gt;, praised the contributions of German Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds to the social stability of the country, noting \"It is not enough to make a declaration of belief. It is important to live according to the basic values of our constitutional state, to defend them and make them secure in the face of all opposition. The members of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith do this because of their faith and the way they see themselves.\" However the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds have been excluded from other dialogues on religious issues. In 2007 a new memorial was unveiled replacing the one that had been taken down in Bad Mergentheim during Nazi Germany. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds from much of Europe were among the more than 4,600 people who gathered in Frankfurt for the largest ever Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed conference in Germany in February 2009.\nDemographics.\nA 1997-8 estimate is of 4,000 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Germany (40 in Hannover). In 2002 there were 106 Local Spiritual Assemblies.\nThe 2007-8 &lt;a href=\"Census%23Germany\"&gt;German Census&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Sampling%20%28statistics%29\"&gt;sampling&lt;/a&gt; estimated 5\u20136,000 registered Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed members in Germany. The &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Religion%20Data%20Archives\"&gt;Association of Religion Data Archives&lt;/a&gt; (relying on &lt;a href=\"World%20Christian%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;World Christian Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;) estimated some 11,743 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2005 and 12,356 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2010. According to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Germany, the German Baha'i community consists of about 100 local communities and 6000 members, towards the end of 2019.\nArtists.\nAmong the better known Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed artists of Germany are:\nProphecies regarding Germany.\nThe writings of &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BCu%27ll%C3%A1h\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h&lt;/a&gt; and \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in the late 19th century and early 20th century contain some prophecies regarding Germany. The first mention related to Germany in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith is when the founder of the religion, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h wrote in the &lt;a href=\"Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas\"&gt;Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas&lt;/a&gt; in 1873:\nO banks of the &lt;a href=\"Rhine\"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt;! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as the swords of retribution were drawn against you; and you shall have another turn. And We hear the lamentations of &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, though she be today in &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;conspicuous glory&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1912, shortly before visiting Germany, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 spoke of the increasing tensions in Europe:\nWe are on the eve of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Armageddon\"&gt;Battle of Armageddon&lt;/a&gt; referred to in the sixteenth chapter of &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Revelation\"&gt;Revelation&lt;/a&gt;... The time is two years hence, when only a spark will set aflame the whole of Europe... by 1917 kingdoms will fall and cataclysms will rock the earth. and in January 1920 he wrote:\nThe ills from which the world now suffers... will multiply; the gloom which envelops it will deepen. The Balkans will remain discontented. Its restlessness will increase. The vanquished Powers will continue to agitate. They will resort to every measure that may rekindle the flame of war."
