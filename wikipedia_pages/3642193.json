    "text": "Anthony Minichiello (born 24 May 1980) is an Australian former professional &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; footballer who captained the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Roosters\"&gt;Sydney Roosters&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;National Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;, and retired having set records for most games and most tries in the club's history. An &lt;a href=\"Australian%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; international as well as a &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Origin%20series\"&gt;State of Origin&lt;/a&gt; representative turned , he played his entire career with the Roosters, with whom he won the &lt;a href=\"2002%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2013%20NRL%20Premiership\"&gt;2013 NRL Premiership&lt;/a&gt;s, before retiring at the conclusion of the club's 2014 campaign. Minichiello also won the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20League%20World%20Golden%20Boot%20Award\"&gt;Golden Boot Award&lt;/a&gt; for international player of the year in 2005, and is the brother of fellow Italian international, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Minichiello\"&gt;Mark Minichiello&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nMinichiello was born in Liverpool in &lt;a href=\"South%20Western%20Sydney\"&gt;South Western Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, Australia.\nMinichiello began playing rugby league for East Valley United. Minichiello attended &lt;a href=\"All%20Saints%20Catholic%20Senior%20College\"&gt;All Saints Catholic Senior College&lt;/a&gt;. At a young age, he was spotted by then Roosters recruitment officer, rugby league &lt;a href=\"The%20Immortals%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Immortal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Beetson\"&gt;Arthur Beetson&lt;/a&gt;, who signed him up to the foundation club. In 1999 he played for Italy in the inaugural &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Cup\"&gt;Mediterranean Cup&lt;/a&gt;., On 4 August 2014 he announced his retirement at the end of the season\nProfessional playing career.\n2000s.\nAfter a stint in the lower grades, Minichiello made his NRL debut at the age of 20 in the Roosters' Round 4 clash on 25 February 2000 at the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Football%20Stadium\"&gt;Sydney Football Stadium&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Canterbury%20Bulldogs\"&gt;Bulldogs&lt;/a&gt;. This made him the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Sydney%20Roosters%20players\"&gt;994th first grader&lt;/a&gt; to play for the Roosters. He tasted the bitterness of defeat at the end of his debut year in the Roosters' loss to the &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20Broncos\"&gt;Brisbane Broncos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20NRL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2000 NRL Grand Final&lt;/a&gt;. By midway through his second season, he had proven himself worthy of representative football when he was selected to play for &lt;a href=\"City%20New%20South%20Wales%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;City Origin&lt;/a&gt; in the 2001 &lt;a href=\"City%20vs%20Country%20Origin\"&gt;City vs Country Origin&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"Country%20New%20South%20Wales%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Country Origin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter scoring 16 tries during the &lt;a href=\"2002%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2002 NRL season&lt;/a&gt;, Minichiello played on the wing for the Roosters in their &lt;a href=\"2002%20NRL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2002 NRL Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; win over the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Warriors\"&gt;New Zealand Warriors&lt;/a&gt;. He was also part of the successful Roosters team that took out the &lt;a href=\"2003%20World%20Club%20Challenge\"&gt;2003 World Club Challenge&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Super%20League%20VII\"&gt;2002 Super League&lt;/a&gt; champions, &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20R.F.C.\"&gt;St. Helens&lt;/a&gt;. With Mini playing fullback, the Roosters easily accounted for Saints 38\u20130 at the &lt;a href=\"Reebok%20Stadium\"&gt;Reebok Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bolton\"&gt;Bolton&lt;/a&gt;, England in front of 19,807 fans. For the first three seasons of his career Mini played on the wing for the Roosters, but the retirement of &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Phillips\"&gt;Luke Phillips&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"2002%20NRL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2002 NRL Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; prompted then-Roosters coach &lt;a href=\"Ricky%20Stuart\"&gt;Ricky Stuart&lt;/a&gt; to move Minichiello to . His move to fullback coincided with some of the Roosters' best football for the early part of the new millennium. It also saw him become an almost automatic selection for both NSW and Australia for the next few seasons. With the help of the recently New Zealand former Warriors fullback and newly appointed Roosters &lt;a href=\"NSWRL%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Cleary\"&gt;Ivan Cleary&lt;/a&gt;, Mini would become a vital part of the Roosters attack. His great performance in his new position soon paid off with selection for City in the 2003 City vs Country Origin match and for New South Wales in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20State%20of%20Origin%20series\"&gt;2003 State of Origin series&lt;/a&gt;, and went on to play in his 100th NRL game for the Roosters in the first Preliminary Final of the &lt;a href=\"2003%20NRL%20season%23Finals\"&gt;2003 NRL Finals Series&lt;/a&gt;. He was declared Man of the Match in the Roosters 28\u201318 victory over the Bulldogs. The Roosters subsequently lost the &lt;a href=\"2003%20NRL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2003 NRL Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Penrith%20Panthers\"&gt;Penrith Panthers&lt;/a&gt;, in which Minichiello played at fullback. Minichiello ran 4,571 metres with the ball in 2003, more than any other player in the competition. After that he was selected to go on the successful &lt;a href=\"2003%20Kangaroo%20tour\"&gt;2003 Kangaroo tour&lt;/a&gt; in which Australia defeated their oldest rivals &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20Lions\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 to retain &lt;a href=\"The%20Ashes%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;The Ashes&lt;/a&gt;. Mini played on the wing for the Kangaroos in all three tests due to the presence of Brisbane Broncos fullback &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Lockyer\"&gt;Darren Lockyer&lt;/a&gt;, who was also the captain of the Kangaroos.\nIn 2004, Minichiello was again selected to play for New South Wales but just five days out from &lt;a href=\"2004%20State%20of%20Origin%20series%23Game%20I\"&gt;Game I&lt;/a&gt; he was sacked for taking a mobile telephone out contrary to team instructions during a wild bonding session. However he fought his way back into the squad and help steered New South Wales to its second series victory. He was named the &lt;a href=\"Dally%20M%20Awards\"&gt;Dally M&lt;/a&gt; \"Fullback of the Year\" in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2004 NRL season&lt;/a&gt;, where he scored a career best 18 tries for the season. He also won the &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Sunderland\"&gt;Harry Sunderland Medal&lt;/a&gt; as the player's player of the year. Mini went on to play at fullback for the Roosters in their 16\u201313 loss to the Bulldogs in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20NRL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2004 NRL Grand Final&lt;/a&gt;. It was the Roosters third Grand Final loss in four games since 2000. Minichiello was selected in the Australian team to go and compete in the end of season &lt;a href=\"2004%20Rugby%20League%20Tri-Nations\"&gt;2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations&lt;/a&gt; tournament. In the final against &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; he played at and scored two tries in the Kangaroos' 44\u20134 victory. Another great season followed in &lt;a href=\"2005%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, where Minichiello's performances at fullback for NSW resulted in him winning the &lt;a href=\"Wally%20Lewis%20Medal\"&gt;Wally Lewis Medal&lt;/a&gt; for player of the &lt;a href=\"2005%20State%20of%20Origin%20series\"&gt;2005 State of Origin series&lt;/a&gt;. The year was capped off with him winning the Harry Sunderland Medal again as the man of the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Rugby%20League%20Tri-Nations\"&gt;2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations&lt;/a&gt; tournament, despite &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; causing a boil over by defeating Australia 24\u20130 in the Final at &lt;a href=\"Elland%20Road\"&gt;Elland Road&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; (it was the first time since &lt;a href=\"1972%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt; that Australia had not won an international series or tournament in which they played). The game would also prove to be Anthony Minichiello's 18th and final test for Australia. He would go on to win the &lt;a href=\"2005%20RLIF%20Golden%20Boot%20Awards\"&gt;2005 Golden Boot Award&lt;/a&gt; as the international player of the year.\nOne of the longest injury/suspension free period of any player in the modern era came to end in Round 6, &lt;a href=\"2006%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. A back injury, first sustained in Roosters' Round 3 clash on 26 March 2006 against the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Raiders\"&gt;Canberra Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, that eventually required surgery ruled Minichiello out for the remainder of season. His back injury allowed several younger fullbacks to stake claims for the Australian jersey, particularly &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20Broncos\"&gt;Brisbane Broncos&lt;/a&gt; fullback &lt;a href=\"Karmichael%20Hunt\"&gt;Karmichael Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. Minichiello's downfall from injury also coincided with the Roosters' decline in form, with the team finishing second from last at the end of the 2006 season. As part of the Roosters' 100th season celebration, a \"Team 100 \u2013 The Centurions\" was announced at the 2007 season launch. Minichiello was named as fullback. He kicked his first field goal in his career when the Roosters defeated the &lt;a href=\"Cronulla-Sutherland%20Sharks\"&gt;Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks&lt;/a&gt; in golden point, in Round 11, 2007. Minichiello was recalled as NSW fullback for Game 1 of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20State%20of%20Origin%20series\"&gt;2007 State of Origin series&lt;/a&gt;. He played an impressive first game (won 25\u201318 by &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20Maroons\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;), but unfortunately was ruled out of the second game and the third game too as his back injury was troubling him. He was replaced as the Blues custodian by &lt;a href=\"Manly-Warringah%20Sea%20Eagles\"&gt;Manly Sea Eagles&lt;/a&gt; flyer &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Stewart%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Brett Stewart&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately Mini's back injury put him on the sideline for the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2007 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2008%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2008 NRL season&lt;/a&gt; saw Mini return to the field after a re-occurrence of his back injury put him out for the back half of the 2007 season. Unfortunately, during a round 4 clash with the Canterbury Bulldogs, pain in his back returned. This severely harmed his chances of regaining his Australian fullback jersey and he was overlooked in favour of both Brett Stewart and &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Storm\"&gt;Melbourne Storm&lt;/a&gt; fullback &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Slater\"&gt;Billy Slater&lt;/a&gt;. Stewart and Slater were also the respective fullbacks for NSW and Qld at the time. In &lt;a href=\"2009%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, Anthony played 2 games before injuring his ankle against the Canberra Raiders. He was sidelined until Round 20; by then, the Roosters were in deep trouble and staring down of their worst season since failing to win a single game in &lt;a href=\"1966%20NSWRFL%20season\"&gt;1966&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Roosters finished last on the NRL ladder, completing a spectacular downfall from the first half of the decade in which the Sydney Roosters were dominant, but had only one NRL Premiership to show for it.\n2010s.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2010%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2010 NRL season&lt;/a&gt;, Minichiello returned to the field injury-free for the first time since 2005. As part of the Roosters \"clean out\", he was moved from fullback to the wing to make way for new recruit &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Carney\"&gt;Todd Carney&lt;/a&gt;. He settled well in this position and was selected to play in the 2010 City v Country Origin match on 7 May 2010. Due to Minichiello's good form, he and his manager cleared all rumours of a possible move to the &lt;a href=\"Cronulla%20Sharks\"&gt;Cronulla Sharks&lt;/a&gt;, and signed a one-year deal with the Roosters with a possible one-year extension on top of that. On 23 August 2010, Minichiello broke the 100 try barrier against the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Titans\"&gt;Gold Coast Titans&lt;/a&gt; in Round 24.\nMinichiello was rested from the Roosters' final two regular season matches with a &lt;a href=\"hamstring\"&gt;hamstring&lt;/a&gt; injury, however he returned to full fitness for the 2010 NRL finals series. The Roosters advanced to the Grand Final, were beaten 32\u20138 by the &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Bennett%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Wayne Bennett&lt;/a&gt; coached &lt;a href=\"St%20George%20Illawarra%20Dragons\"&gt;St George Illawarra Dragons&lt;/a&gt; in a disappointing end to what was otherwise a massive improvement from the previous year. By Round 8 of the 2010 season, Mini had been moved back to fullback by coach &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Smith%20%28rugby%20league%2C%20born%201954%29\"&gt;Brian Smith&lt;/a&gt;, with Carney moving to his preferred position of . Other than playing on the wing in rounds 12 and 13, Mini would remain at fullback for the rest of the year. For his part, Carney would go on to win the &lt;a href=\"Dally%20M%20Medal\"&gt;Dally M Medal&lt;/a&gt; as the NRL Player of the Year, the first Roosters player to do so since &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Freeman%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Gary Freeman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1992%20NSWRL%20season\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2011 he was announced as a member of the Italian side that will compete in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup%20qualifying\"&gt;2013 World Cup qualifying&lt;/a&gt;. After consistent form in a struggling Roosters side, Minichiello received an Origin call-up for Game 2 of the &lt;a href=\"2011%20State%20of%20Origin%20series\"&gt;2011 State of Origin series&lt;/a&gt;. This occurred after the incumbent Blues fullback, &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Dugan\"&gt;Josh Dugan&lt;/a&gt;, succumbed to an ankle injury the day the side was named. Minichiello's experience in the young Blues backline proved valuable as he scored the match-winner for New South Wales after Five-eight &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Soward\"&gt;Jamie Soward&lt;/a&gt; dazzled the Queensland defence. The Blues won 18\u20138, largely due to the experienced combination of Minichiello and Ricky Stuart, who was back coaching New South Wales after five years out of the side. In Round 16 of the &lt;a href=\"2011%20NRL%20season\"&gt;NRL season&lt;/a&gt;, he scored his 105th try against the &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20Knights\"&gt;Newcastle Knights&lt;/a&gt;, making him the all-time leading try-scorer for the Roosters, breaking the record of 104 previously held by &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Mullins\"&gt;Bill Mullins&lt;/a&gt; (1968\u201378).\nAt the end of the 2011 NRL season, Minichiello captained Italy to a 19-all draw with &lt;a href=\"Lebanon%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; that was enough for them to gain the 14th and final place in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2013 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 4 May 2012, Minichiello agreed to a new one-year deal keeping him with the Roosters until the end of 2013, despite being told at the start of the season that he would not be re-signed.\nMinichello went on to captain the Roosters in 2013 and to the &lt;a href=\"2013%20NRL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2013 NRL Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; victory, becoming the first fullback to captain his team to a grand final victory since &lt;a href=\"Frank%20McMillan\"&gt;Frank 'Skinny' McMillan&lt;/a&gt; in 1934.\nAt the end of the 2013 NRL season, Minichiello captained &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2013 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Italy would finish their campaign in the Group Stage after they beat Wales, drew with Scotland and lost to Tonga.\nOn 4 August Minichiello announced his official retirement from the game as a one club man.\nIn his final outing for the club, Minichiello broke former team-mate &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Ricketson\"&gt;Luke Ricketson&lt;/a&gt;'s record for most matches with the Roosters. The record, which had stood for twelve years, was 301, with Minichiello captaining the Roosters with a stellar two-try performance for game #302 in his side's 32\u201322 Grand Final Qualifier defeat by the Rabbitohs, His record was surpassed by &lt;a href=\"Mitchell%20Aubusson\"&gt;Mitchell Aubusson&lt;/a&gt; (306) in 2020.\nHonours.\nIndividual\nTeam\nPersonal life.\nFormerly a gymnast, Minichiello was a finalist in the Sexiest Man in League contest for 2006, where he finished sixth with 7% of the vote. He was crowned the NRL's Most Wanted on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20NRL%20Footy%20Show\"&gt;The Footy Show&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2003, and with his brother &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Minichiello\"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; (who is currently playing for &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull FC&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt;), posed for \"&lt;a href=\"Cosmopolitan%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine's \"&lt;a href=\"Lonsdale%20%28clothing%29\"&gt;Lonsdale&lt;/a&gt; Boys with Balls '06\" feature.\nHe is the elder brother of &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull F.C.&lt;/a&gt; er &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Minichiello\"&gt;Mark Minichiello&lt;/a&gt;. Both players are of &lt;a href=\"Italians\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; descent.\nHis nickname is \"The Count\" as he has been noted to bear a resemblance to &lt;a href=\"Count%20von%20Count\"&gt;The Count&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Sesame%20Street\"&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt;\". He is also known as \"Mini\".\nOn 22 January 2012, Anthony Minichiello wed Australian shoe-designer, Terry Biviano, in one of the most lavish ceremonies held at &lt;a href=\"St%20Mary%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;St Mary's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney.
