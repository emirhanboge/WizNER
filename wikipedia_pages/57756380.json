    "text": "Red nuggets is the nickname given to rare, unusually small &lt;a href=\"galaxy\"&gt;galaxies&lt;/a&gt; packed with large amounts of red &lt;a href=\"star\"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt;s that were originally observed by &lt;a href=\"Hubble%20Space%20Telescope\"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 in the young universe. They are ancient remnants of the first massive galaxies. The environments of red nuggets are usually consistent with the general &lt;a href=\"elliptical%20galaxy\"&gt;elliptical galaxy&lt;/a&gt; population. Most red nuggets have &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20merger\"&gt;merged with other galaxies&lt;/a&gt;, but some managed to stay unscathed.\nNaming.\nRed nuggets are not only nicknamed for their &lt;a href=\"size\"&gt;size&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"color\"&gt;color&lt;/a&gt;, but also for how precious the discovery is to curious &lt;a href=\"astronomer\"&gt;astronomer&lt;/a&gt;s since it challenged current theories at the time the term was coined on &lt;a href=\"galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution\"&gt;galaxy formation&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormation of red nuggets.\nRed nuggets are formed from blue nuggets. Blue nuggets are early, stream fed, &lt;a href=\"star%20formation\"&gt;star-forming&lt;/a&gt; systems that are quenched inside-out within the inner &lt;a href=\"parsec\"&gt;kiloparsec&lt;/a&gt; (kpc) and dissipatively compacted into red nuggets at their peak of gas compaction. The compaction of the blue nugget happens at an approximately constant specific star formation rate (or SFR). The quenching of the blue nugget happens at a completely constant stellar surface density. Galaxies with more &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; quench earlier than galaxies with low amounts of mass because galaxies with low amounts of mass try to quench several times. The compaction happens due to a fierce period of inflow involving (mostly small) mergers and counter-rotating streams or recycled gas. It is also frequently associated with extreme disc instability. The quenching happens because of the extremely high SFR, stellar and supernova feedback, and possibly also active galactic nuclei feedback due to the high gas density in the center of the red nugget.\nStar formation.\nData from NASA's &lt;a href=\"Chandra%20X-Ray%20Observatory\"&gt;Chandra X-Ray Observatory&lt;/a&gt; observing the red nuggets Mrk 1216 and PGC 032673 has shown that the central &lt;a href=\"black%20hole\"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt;s suppress star formation in red nuggets with their &lt;a href=\"heat\"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; and feed on the gas surrounding them. This brings up the intriguing question on how they could possibly be packed so &lt;a href=\"density\"&gt;densely&lt;/a&gt; with stars. Results show that red nuggets may have untapped stellar \"fuel\" to produce their unusually large number of stars. Another &lt;a href=\"scientific%20theory\"&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; says that red nuggets are young elliptical galaxies, therefore forming the same way they do.\nSloan Digital Sky Survey.\nA team led by Ivana Damjanov found over 600 red nugget candidates in the &lt;a href=\"Sloan%20Digital%20Sky%20Survey\"&gt;Sloan Digital Sky Survey&lt;/a&gt; (or SDSS) database, of which 9 were confirmed as red nuggets. These red nuggets have been missed so long because, due to their extremely small size, they look like stars in pictures. But their &lt;a href=\"spectrum\"&gt;spectra&lt;/a&gt; shows what they really are. Damjanov expressed how truly amazing the discovery was when she said, \u201cLooking for \u2018red nuggets\u2019 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey was like panning a riverbed, washing away silt and mud to uncover bits of gold,\u201dBefore Damjanov and her team had thought to look through the immense database of the SDSS, no one could find the elusive galaxies after their original discovery in 2005."
