He joined Arsenal in August 2019 for a fee reported at \u00a325\u00a0million, a &lt;a href=\"Football%20records%20in%20Scotland%23Record%20transfer%20fees%20received\"&gt;record amount&lt;/a&gt; both for a Scottish national and for a player from the Scottish league.\nClub career.\nEarly life and youth football.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Douglas%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Douglas&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/a&gt;, Tierney moved to &lt;a href=\"Wishaw\"&gt;Wishaw&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland aged 10 months. He supported &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; as a child and signed for the club when he was 7 years old. He was educated at &lt;a href=\"Motherwell\"&gt;Motherwell&lt;/a&gt; schools St Brendan's RC Primary and &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%27s%20High%20School%2C%20Motherwell\"&gt;Our Lady's High&lt;/a&gt; (one year group behind fellow footballers, twins &lt;a href=\"Nicky%20Cadden\"&gt;Nicky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Cadden\"&gt;Chris Cadden&lt;/a&gt;) then attended &lt;a href=\"St%20Ninian%27s%20High%20School%2C%20Kirkintilloch\"&gt;St Ninian's High School, Kirkintilloch&lt;/a&gt;, which has a development partnership with Celtic. He has spoken of his hope of emulating the late &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Gemmell\"&gt;Tommy Gemmell&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Lisbon%20Lions\"&gt;Lisbon Lions&lt;/a&gt; team who also grew up in Wishaw (specifically, &lt;a href=\"Craigneuk\"&gt;Craigneuk&lt;/a&gt;) and played in the same position.\nHe progressed through the various youth ranks and earned a reputation as a dependable wide player in the club's &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.%20Reserve%20and%20Youth%20squads\"&gt;development squad&lt;/a&gt;, both in defence and attack. He travelled with the first team squad on a pre-season trip to Finland in August 2014, and made his debut in a friendly against &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt; there. Although Celtic lost, Tierney described his first appearance for the first team as a \"dream come true\". He continued to play in the development squad throughout 2014\u201315, and in October 2014 during a &lt;a href=\"SPFL%20Development%20League\"&gt;Development League&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.%20Under-20s%20and%20Academy\"&gt;Heart of Midlothian&lt;/a&gt; he scored a goal from the edge of his own penalty box.\nCeltic.\n2015\u201316: Debut and breakthrough.\nTierney made his competitive senior debut for Celtic on 22 April 2015, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute in a &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premiership\"&gt;Scottish Premiership&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee&lt;/a&gt;. He made one further first team appearance that season, playing over an hour in a league match away at &lt;a href=\"St%20Johnstone%20F.C.\"&gt;St Johnstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nTierney enjoyed a breakthrough season in &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;2015\u201316&lt;/a&gt;, appearing in over 30 matches and displacing the more experienced &lt;a href=\"Emilio%20Izaguirre\"&gt;Emilio Izaguirre&lt;/a&gt; as first-choice left back. For his performances he was awarded with both the &lt;a href=\"PFA%20Scotland%20Young%20Player%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Players'&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SFWA%20Young%20Player%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Writers'&lt;/a&gt; Young Player annual awards, while Celtic also won the league title. Despite interest from &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; clubs, Tierney signed a new five-year contract on 24 June 2016, keeping him at Parkhead until 2021. After making his first appearances in the &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage%23Group%20C\"&gt;group stage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, Tierney suffered ankle ligament damage during training on 27 October 2016 and was initially ruled out of action for two months. During the layoff, which caused him to miss the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Scottish%20League%20Cup%20Final%20%28November%29\"&gt;League Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, he received treatment on a recurring shoulder injury and attended several Celtic matches as a typical supporter in the company of his childhood friends.\n2017\u20132019: Back-to-back domestic trebles.\nOn 22 January 2017, after missing three months, he made his long-awaited return to the Celtic team in a &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; tie against &lt;a href=\"Albion%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Albion Rovers&lt;/a&gt;. Tierney was crowned PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year for the second consecutive season on 7 May, making him the first to achieve this since &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Levein\"&gt;Craig Levein&lt;/a&gt; in 1986. He suffered a jaw injury early in the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Scottish%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2017 Scottish Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; and had to be substituted for treatment. Celtic won the match 2\u20131 to complete a &lt;a href=\"Treble%20%28association%20football%29%23Domestic%20trebles\"&gt;domestic treble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20unbeaten%20football%20club%20seasons\"&gt;undefeated season&lt;/a&gt;.

On 30 October, a week after scoring in an important &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Scottish%20Premiership\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; victory away to closest challengers &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%20F.C.\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;, he extended his contract with Celtic until 2023.\nBy the end of the season, he had collected further personal accolades\u2014winning both the &lt;a href=\"PFA%20Scotland%20Young%20Player%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Players'&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SFWA%20Young%20Player%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Writers'&lt;/a&gt; Young Player awards for the third campaign in succession\u2014and performed a major role in securing a historic 'double treble' for the club, making more than 50 appearances and playing the entirety of the domestic cup finals, both being 2\u20130 wins over &lt;a href=\"Motherwell%20F.C.\"&gt;Motherwell&lt;/a&gt;.

Soon afterwards a hip injury meant that he was ruled out of action, returning on 24 February 2019. He then suffered from a hernia, which subsequently required surgery.\nArsenal.\n2019\u20132021: FA Cup win and injuries.\nOn 8 August 2019, Tierney signed for &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;, for a reported \u00a325\u00a0million fee. Tierney missed the early part of the 2019\u201320 season, having undergone a double hernia operation in May 2019. He made his first-team debut for Arsenal in a 5\u20130 win against &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.\"&gt;Nottingham Forest&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"EFL%20Cup\"&gt;EFL Cup&lt;/a&gt; on 24 September.
