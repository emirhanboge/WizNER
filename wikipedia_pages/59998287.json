    "text": "Guardsman Pass (elevation is a high &lt;a href=\"mountain%20pass\"&gt;mountain pass&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wasatch%20Mountains\"&gt;Wasatch Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of Utah. The pass is located on the boundaries of the &lt;a href=\"Uinta-Wasatch-Cache%20National%20Forest\"&gt;Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest&lt;/a&gt; (specifically the portion known as the &lt;a href=\"Wasatch%20National%20Forest\"&gt;Wasatch National Forest&lt;/a&gt;) to the west, and the &lt;a href=\"Bonanza%20Flats\"&gt;Bonanza Flats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"backcountry\"&gt;backcountry&lt;/a&gt; area to the east.\nIt is located just south of &lt;a href=\"Tri-County%20Peak\"&gt;Tri-County Peak&lt;/a&gt;, where Summit, Wasatch, and Salt Lake counties meet, and also provides summer &lt;a href=\"hiking\"&gt;hiking&lt;/a&gt; and winter &lt;a href=\"snowmobiling\"&gt;snowmobiling&lt;/a&gt; access to &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Peak\"&gt;Clayton Peak&lt;/a&gt; at the top of Brighton ski area. It is also a &lt;a href=\"trailhead\"&gt;trailhead&lt;/a&gt; for other trails in the area, though some are being moved due to the lack of space for &lt;a href=\"parking\"&gt;parking&lt;/a&gt; and the limited &lt;a href=\"sight%20distance\"&gt;sight distance&lt;/a&gt; for vehicles pulling out onto the roadway.\nAccess.\nGuardsman Pass is traversed by Guardsman Pass Road, which is also designated as &lt;a href=\"SR-190%20%28UT%29\"&gt;Utah 190&lt;/a&gt; west (and formerly east) of the pass. Due to heavy amounts of &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; at the high elevation of the pass, this road is closed in winter, generally from November to May but depending on actual conditions each year.\nThis road connects to &lt;a href=\"Big%20Cottonwood%20Canyon\"&gt;Big Cottonwood Canyon&lt;/a&gt; on the west side of the pass. On the east side, it connects to &lt;a href=\"Midway%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Midway&lt;/a&gt; via Pine Canyon Road and &lt;a href=\"SR-222%20%28UT%29\"&gt;Utah 222&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href=\"Park%20City%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Park City&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"SR-224%20%28UT%29\"&gt;Utah 224&lt;/a&gt; over nearby &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Pass\"&gt;Empire Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nWasatch county paved the last unpaved section of the road over just a few days in late September 2018, also installing around of &lt;a href=\"guard%20rail\"&gt;guard rail&lt;/a&gt;. This section from the pass to 224 is immediately below &lt;a href=\"Pinyon%20Ridge\"&gt;Pinyon Ridge&lt;/a&gt; (including Jupiter Hill) which divides Wasatch and Summit counties, and is the southern boundary for the &lt;a href=\"Park%20City%20Mountain%20Resort\"&gt;Park City Mountain Resort&lt;/a&gt; and part of &lt;a href=\"Deer%20Valley%20Resort\"&gt;Deer Valley Resort&lt;/a&gt; ski areas."
