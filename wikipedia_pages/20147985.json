    "text": "The 2009 Heineken Cup Final was the final match of the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Heineken%20Cup\"&gt;2008\u201309 Heineken Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the 14th season of Europe's top club &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; competition. The match was played on 23 May 2009 at &lt;a href=\"Murrayfield%20Stadium\"&gt;Murrayfield Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;; this was the second time that the Heineken Cup final had been held at Murrayfield after the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2005 final&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Toulousain\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Fran%C3%A7ais\"&gt;Stade Fran\u00e7ais&lt;/a&gt; 18\u201312 after &lt;a href=\"extra%20time\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe match was contested by &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20Tigers\"&gt;Leicester Tigers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Rugby\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. While Leinster were making their first appearance in the Heineken Cup final, Leicester were playing in their fifth, having won the competition twice, though not since &lt;a href=\"2002%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;; they did, however, finish as runners-up in &lt;a href=\"2007%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeinster won the match 19\u201316; Leinster took the lead via an early drop goal from &lt;a href=\"Brian%20O%27Driscoll\"&gt;Brian O'Driscoll&lt;/a&gt;, only for &lt;a href=\"Julien%20Dupuy\"&gt;Julien Dupuy&lt;/a&gt; to equalise with a penalty a couple of minutes later. Leinster then moved 9\u20133 ahead with a drop goal from the halfway line and a penalty from &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Sexton\"&gt;Jonathan Sexton&lt;/a&gt;. However, after &lt;a href=\"Stan%20Wright%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Stan Wright&lt;/a&gt; was sin-binned on the half-hour mark for an off-the-ball challenge on &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Vesty\"&gt;Sam Vesty&lt;/a&gt;, Leicester reduced the deficit to three points with another Dupuy penalty, before taking a 13\u20139 half-time lead via a converted try from &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Woods\"&gt;Ben Woods&lt;/a&gt;. Dupuy increased Leicester's lead to seven points with a third penalty goal just after the interval, but a converted try from &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Heaslip\"&gt;Jamie Heaslip&lt;/a&gt; brought the teams level with half an hour left to play. Then, with ten minutes left on the clock, Jonathan Sexton squeezed a penalty inside the right-hand upright to win the match for Leinster.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Murrayfield%20Stadium\"&gt;Murrayfield Stadium&lt;/a&gt; was chosen as the venue for the 2009 Heineken Cup Final on 19 May 2008. The 2009 final was the second Heineken Cup final to be hosted by the 67,778-capacity stadium, following the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2005 final&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Toulousain\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Fran%C3%A7ais\"&gt;Stade Fran\u00e7ais&lt;/a&gt; 18\u201312 after &lt;a href=\"extra%20time\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt; in front of 51,000 spectators.\nThe 2009 final was Leinster's first Heineken Cup final, although they had reached the semi-final stage on three other occasions: in &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20Heineken%20Cup\"&gt;1995\u201396&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Heineken%20Cup\"&gt;2002\u201303&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Heineken%20Cup\"&gt;2005\u201306&lt;/a&gt;, when they were knocked out by &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20RFC\"&gt;Cardiff RFC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"USA%20Perpignan\"&gt;Perpignan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Munster%20Rugby\"&gt;Munster&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Leicester, however, had reached the final on four other occasions: &lt;a href=\"1997%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2001%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2002%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2007%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;; they won the competition in 2001 and 2002, beating Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Munster, but lost out to &lt;a href=\"CA%20Brive\"&gt;Brive&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 and &lt;a href=\"Wasps%20RFC\"&gt;London Wasps&lt;/a&gt; in 2007.\n&lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Owens\"&gt;Nigel Owens&lt;/a&gt; of Wales was named as the match referee for the 2009 final on 13 May 2009, making him the second official to referee consecutive Heineken Cup finals after England's &lt;a href=\"Chris%20White%20%28referee%29\"&gt;Chris White&lt;/a&gt;. Frenchman &lt;a href=\"Christophe%20Berdos\"&gt;Christophe Berdos&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as &lt;a href=\"Assistant%20referee%20%28association%20football%29%23Fourth%20official\"&gt;fourth official&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoute to the final.\nLeinster.\nFor the pool stage draw, the 24 entrants were divided up into four tiers based on their &lt;a href=\"European%20Rugby%20Club%20Rankings\"&gt;European Rugby Club ranking&lt;/a&gt;; each group would consist of one team from each tier, and no country could have more than one team in the same group \u2013 with the exception of &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, which would have two teams in one group. Leinster was placed in Tier 2, which would mean that they would avoid being drawn with teams like &lt;a href=\"Gloucester%20Rugby\"&gt;Gloucester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sale%20Sharks\"&gt;Sale Sharks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlets\"&gt;Scarlets&lt;/a&gt;, but they could still be drawn with &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Toulousain\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Fran%C3%A7ais\"&gt;Stade Fran\u00e7ais&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ospreys%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Ospreys&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20Blues\"&gt;Cardiff Blues&lt;/a&gt;. They ended up being drawn in Pool 2 alongside &lt;a href=\"Wasps%20RFC\"&gt;London Wasps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castres%20Olympique\"&gt;Castres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20Rugby\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeinster won four of their pool stage matches, but a Matchday 5 defeat to Wasps meant that they had to equal or better the London side's result on the final matchday to be guaranteed a place in the knockout stage as group winners. In the end, Leinster's 12\u20133 win over Edinburgh was sufficient as Wasps were defeated in Castres and Leinster qualified as the sixth seeds for the quarter-finals, meaning that they would have to play away to third seeds &lt;a href=\"Harlequin%20F.C.\"&gt;Harlequins&lt;/a&gt; in the quarter-finals.\nLeinster's quarter-final against Harlequins was the last of the quarter-finals to be played, and also the lowest-scoring: Harlequins responded to two first-half penalties from &lt;a href=\"Felipe%20Contepomi\"&gt;Felipe Contepomi&lt;/a&gt; with a 65th-minute &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Brown%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Mike Brown&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Malone\"&gt;Chris Malone&lt;/a&gt; had the chance to give Harlequins the lead, but his &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;conversion&lt;/a&gt; attempt went wide of the far post. Brown also missed with a long-range &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt;, while an injured &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Evans%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Nick Evans&lt;/a&gt;, who had come on as a &lt;a href=\"blood%20replacement\"&gt;blood replacement&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Bloodgate\"&gt;dubious circumstances&lt;/a&gt;, sent a last-minute &lt;a href=\"Drop%20goal%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;drop goal&lt;/a&gt; attempt wide to give Leinster a 6\u20135 win.\nThe draw for the semi-finals was also made in January 2009, with the winners of Leinster's quarter-final due to play against either &lt;a href=\"Munster%20Rugby\"&gt;Munster&lt;/a&gt; or the Ospreys. Munster came through their quarter-final comfortably, beating the Ospreys 43\u20139 to set up an all-Irish semi-final. As Heineken Cup holders and newly crowned champions of the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Celtic%20League\"&gt;Celtic League&lt;/a&gt;, Munster went into the game as favourites, but Leinster drew first blood with an early drop goal from fly-half Felipe Contepomi. &lt;a href=\"Ronan%20O%27Gara\"&gt;Ronan O'Gara&lt;/a&gt; equalised with a penalty shortly after. Several minutes later, Leinster suffered a major blow when Contepomi went down with what proved to be a cruciate ligament injury. A penalty from Contepomi's replacement, &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Sexton\"&gt;Jonathan Sexton&lt;/a&gt;, and an unconverted try from &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20D%27Arcy\"&gt;Gordon D'Arcy&lt;/a&gt; gave Leinster an 11\u20133 lead; a second penalty from O'Gara reduced Leinster's half-time lead to 11\u20136. Another try for Leinster, this time from &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Luke Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, just after the interval put them two scores ahead, before &lt;a href=\"Brian%20O%27Driscoll\"&gt;Brian O'Driscoll&lt;/a&gt; intercepted a pass from Ronan O'Gara to score under the posts and round off a 25\u20136 win for Leinster. The match marked the first time that a club rugby match had been played at &lt;a href=\"Croke%20Park\"&gt;Croke Park&lt;/a&gt;, and the 82,208 attendance for the match set a new world record in club Rugby Union.\nLeicester Tigers.\nBased on their European Club Rugby ranking, Leicester Tigers were placed in Tier 1 for the pool stage draw, meaning that they would avoid being drawn with &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Toulousain\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Fran%C3%A7ais\"&gt;Stade Fran\u00e7ais&lt;/a&gt; and holders &lt;a href=\"Munster%20Rugby\"&gt;Munster&lt;/a&gt;. They were eventually drawn into Pool 3 with &lt;a href=\"USA%20Perpignan\"&gt;Perpignan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ospreys%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Ospreys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benetton%20Rugby\"&gt;Benetton Treviso&lt;/a&gt;.\nFour wins in their first five matches meant that Leicester went into their final pool match against the Ospreys needing only a point to reach the knockout stage. Within 15 minutes of the match kicking off, they were already 6\u20133 down; the score remained that way until half-time, after which the two teams continued to trade penalties, resulting in a final score of 15\u20139 to the Ospreys. The six-point margin gave the Tigers the losing bonus point they needed and they qualified for the quarter-finals as pool winners. Their pool record meant that they were given the fourth seed for the quarter-finals, meaning that they would face a home match against the fifth seeds, &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Rugby\"&gt;Bath&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeicester went into the quarter-finals as the joint-top try scorers from the pool stage, while Bath had the second-lowest number of tries. Nevertheless, it was Bath substitute &lt;a href=\"Shaun%20Berne\"&gt;Shaun Berne&lt;/a&gt; who scored the first try of the quarter-final, going 7\u20136 up after &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Vesty\"&gt;Sam Vesty&lt;/a&gt; had scored two penalties in the first quarter of the game. After half-time, the two teams traded penalties before &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Maddock%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Joe Maddock&lt;/a&gt; crossed for Bath's second try in the 64th minute. Vesty levelled the scores at 15\u201315 soon after, but just as the match looked like it was heading to extra time, Leicester's replacement scrum-half &lt;a href=\"Julien%20Dupuy\"&gt;Julien Dupuy&lt;/a&gt; feinted to pass back to Vesty in the pocket for a match-winning drop goal before scurrying through a gap at the base of the ruck on the edge of Bath's 22-metre line to score a try. Leicester's 20\u201315 win secured them a place in the semi-finals, where they would play the &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20Blues\"&gt;Cardiff Blues&lt;/a&gt;, who had beaten Toulouse 9\u20136 earlier that day.\nThe Blues were the only team to come through the pool stage unbeaten and, going into the quarter-finals, they were the joint-top try scorers in the competition, along with Leicester themselves. &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Blair\"&gt;Ben Blair&lt;/a&gt; gave Cardiff the lead with a penalty before the 15-minute mark, but Leicester responded with a converted try from &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Hamilton%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Scott Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; and a Julien Dupuy penalty to take the score to 10\u20133. Cardiff hit back with three penalties of their own before Dupuy slotted over to give Leicester a 13\u201312 half-time lead. After half-time, Leicester increased their lead with a converted try from &lt;a href=\"Geordan%20Murphy\"&gt;Geordan Murphy&lt;/a&gt; and two more penalties from Dupuy; however, only a few minutes later, the Tigers were hit with two quick-fire sin-binnings, and the Blues took full advantage by scoring two converted tries from &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Roberts\"&gt;Jamie Roberts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20James%20%28rugby%20union%2C%20born%201987%29\"&gt;Tom James&lt;/a&gt; to tie the scores at 26\u201326 and send the game into &lt;a href=\"extra%20time\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from two missed drop goal attempts from &lt;a href=\"Johne%20Murphy\"&gt;Johne Murphy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Mauger\"&gt;Aaron Mauger&lt;/a&gt;, extra time was largely uneventful and the match went to the first &lt;a href=\"penalty%20shootout\"&gt;penalty shootout&lt;/a&gt; in Heineken Cup history. The first seven kicks in the shootout were all successful, giving Cardiff a 4\u20133 lead before Johne Murphy stepped up; however, the Irish winger missed the target, giving Tom James a chance to win the shootout for the Blues, only for the Welshman to miss his kick, allowing Scott Hamilton to convert and take the shootout to sudden death. Both teams successfully converted two more kicks before &lt;a href=\"Martyn%20Williams\"&gt;Martyn Williams&lt;/a&gt; wildly hooked his attempt wide and &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Crane%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Jordan Crane&lt;/a&gt; slotted over to send Leicester into the final.\nMatch.\nLeinster beat Leicester 19\u201316. They led Leicester 9\u20133 within 30 minutes following drop goals by &lt;a href=\"Brian%20O%27Driscoll\"&gt;Brian O'Driscoll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Sexton\"&gt;Johnny Sexton&lt;/a&gt; and a penalty by Sexton. They then had &lt;a href=\"Stan%20Wright%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Stan Wright&lt;/a&gt; sin-binned, with Leicester moving into a 13\u20139 lead at half-time thanks to a &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Woods\"&gt;Ben Woods&lt;/a&gt; try. Leinster's &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Heaslip\"&gt;Jamie Heaslip&lt;/a&gt; scored a try to level the scores in the second half, with Sexton scoring another penalty to win the match ten minutes before the end.\nReaction.\nIreland's &lt;a href=\"Taoiseach\"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Cowen\"&gt;Brian Cowen&lt;/a&gt; attended the match and said he was \"absolutely delighted\" and that it was a \"real pleasure\" to be present at a \"hugely exciting match\". He said it had been part of \"a golden year\" for the sport in Ireland.\n&lt;a href=\"John%20Gormley\"&gt;John Gormley&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Irish &lt;a href=\"Green%20Party%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt;, said the team deserved \"the country's fullest praise and admiration\" for lifting themselves \"to the very heights of the international game\".\nThe British media reported in the aftermath that \"everything Irish rugby touches at the moment turns to gleaming silver\".\nThe Leinster team were welcomed back at a special ceremony in their regular home ground, the &lt;a href=\"RDS%20Arena\"&gt;RDS Arena&lt;/a&gt;, on 24 May 2009. Spectators did not have to pay to attend this celebration, which also featured live music and family activities.\nLeicester were reported to have taken \"their considerable disappointment on the chin\"."
