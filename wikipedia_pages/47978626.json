During his high school years, he turned out for at age group level and captained their under-16 side.\nSenior Rugby.\nAged just 18, Apisai first played provincial rugby for during the &lt;a href=\"2014%20ITM%20Cup\"&gt;2014 ITM Cup&lt;/a&gt;, making 2 appearances including 1 start. The campaign was not a happy one for the Lions as they were relegated down to the Championship division for the &lt;a href=\"2015%20ITM%20Cup\"&gt;2015 season&lt;/a&gt; after recording just 1 win in 10 games.\nWellington were unable to gain promotion back to the Premiership at the first time of asking, finishing 2nd behind on the Championship log before being defeated 26-25 by the same opposition in the playoff final. Although the season was one of disappointment for his team, for Apisai personally, it saw him take advantage of &lt;a href=\"Motu%20Matu%27u\"&gt;Motu Matu'u&lt;/a&gt;'s involvement with in the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2015 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; to establish himself as the Lions first choice in the number 2 jersey, playing all 12 games during the season and scoring 2 tries.\nMatu'u departed for &lt;a href=\"Gloucester%20Rugby\"&gt;Gloucester&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Mitre%2010%20Cup\"&gt;2016 Mitre 10 Cup&lt;/a&gt; leaving Apisai unchallenged as Wellington's main hooker for the year. He played 10 of their 11 games during the year and helped himself to 3 tries as they once again finished 2nd in the Championship, this time behind and were then surprisingly defeated 40-37 at home by in the playoff semi-finals with his 11th minute try scored in vain.\nSuper Rugby.\nAfter just 2 provincial appearances for Wellington, Apisai was named as part of the wider training group ahead of the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Super%20Rugby%20season\"&gt;2015 Super Rugby season&lt;/a&gt;.

Apisai was left temporarily as the 'Canes first choice number 2 and debuted in week 1 of the season, a 52-10 defeat away to the .
