    "text": "The Italian overture is a piece of &lt;a href=\"orchestra\"&gt;orchestra&lt;/a&gt;l &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; which opened several &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"oratorio\"&gt;oratorio&lt;/a&gt;s and other large-scale works in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.\nAn Italian overture typically has a three-&lt;a href=\"movement%20%28music%29\"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; structure \u2013 the outer movements are quick, the middle movement is slow.\nThis type of overture was particularly popular among Italian composers such as &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Scarlatti\"&gt;Alessandro Scarlatti&lt;/a&gt;, and in the early 18th century would usually be called \"&lt;a href=\"sinfonia\"&gt;sinfonia&lt;/a&gt;\". Later, to avoid confusion with other types of sinfonia/&lt;a href=\"symphony\"&gt;symphony&lt;/a&gt;, the term \"Italian overture\" was used more frequently.\nThe structure of the Italian overture/sinfonia was the base from which the &lt;a href=\"Classical%20period%20%28music%29\"&gt;classical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"multi-movement\"&gt;multi-movement&lt;/a&gt; cycle - used in genres including the &lt;a href=\"symphony\"&gt;symphony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"concerto\"&gt;concerto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sonata\"&gt;sonata&lt;/a&gt; - developed around the middle of the 18th century. For more about the (18th century) relationship between \"Italian\" overtures, other types of overtures (e.g. the \"&lt;a href=\"French%20overture\"&gt;French overture&lt;/a&gt;\") and early symphonies, see &lt;a href=\"sinfonia\"&gt;sinfonia&lt;/a&gt;."
