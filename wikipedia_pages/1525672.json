    "text": "The Irish Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly referred to as the Irish Cup (currently known as the Samuel Gelston's Whiskey Irish Cup for sponsorship purposes) is the primary &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"single%20elimination\"&gt;knock-out&lt;/a&gt; cup competition in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. Inaugurated in 1881, it is the fourth-oldest national cup competition in the world. Prior to the break-away from the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Irish Football Association&lt;/a&gt; by clubs from what would become the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt; in 1921, the Irish Cup was the national cup competition for the whole of &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 30 November 2021, the cup has been sponsored by \"Samuel Gelston's Irish Whiskey\". It was previously sponsored by &lt;a href=\"Nationwide%20Building%20Society\"&gt;Nationwide Building Society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bass%20%28beer%29\"&gt;Bass Ireland Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"JJB%20Sports\"&gt;JJB Sports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wellpark%20Brewery\"&gt;Tennent's Lager&lt;/a&gt; and Sadler's Peaky Blinder. 126 clubs entered the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2018\u201319&lt;/a&gt; competition.\n&lt;a href=\"Linfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Linfield&lt;/a&gt; are the current holders, after they defeated &lt;a href=\"Larne%20F.C.\"&gt;Larne&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 in the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2021 final&lt;/a&gt; to win the competition for a record 44th time.\nFormat.\nDuring the cup's history, different formats and rules have been used in respect of eligibility to enter the competition, the number of teams and rounds, replays, extra time, penalties, etc. The competition is open to all &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Football%20Association\"&gt;IFA-affiliated&lt;/a&gt; clubs with &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;intermediate or senior&lt;/a&gt; status. Clubs obtain such status by meeting minimum criteria laid down by the IFA in respect of facilities, etc. Each club, for example, must have its own enclosed ground. The competition usually begins in August or September with the first qualifying round, and ends with the final in May of the following year. Clubs from level 3 (the &lt;a href=\"NIFL%20Premier%20Intermediate%20League\"&gt;NIFL Premier Intermediate League&lt;/a&gt;) and all regional league entrants from &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;level 4 and below&lt;/a&gt; enter in the first qualifying round. These clubs play against each other over four qualifying rounds, until 8 clubs remain. The 8 fourth qualifying round winners then join the 24 senior clubs from levels 1 and 2 of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20Football%20League\"&gt;Northern Ireland Football League&lt;/a&gt; in the first round of the main competition, which consists of 32 clubs and is played in January.\nThe competition has always been played in a randomly-drawn &lt;a href=\"single%20elimination\"&gt;knock-out&lt;/a&gt; format. Depending on the number of entrants, the draw sometimes necessitates &lt;a href=\"Bye%20%28sport%29\"&gt;byes&lt;/a&gt; in the earlier rounds. If a team receives a bye, they automatically get drawn first in the following round to avoid the possibility of a team receiving multiple byes. The team drawn first from each tie hosts the match, except in the case of an intermediate team from level 3 or below being drawn first against a senior team from levels 1 or 2. In that scenario, the tie is played at the ground of the 'senior' team. In all ties that finish level after 90 minutes, &lt;a href=\"extra%20time\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt; is played and (if necessary) &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalties&lt;/a&gt; are used to decide the winner. Both semi-finals and the final are usually played at &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Park\"&gt;Windsor Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe winners &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Irish%20football%20clubs%20in%20European%20competitions\"&gt;qualify to represent Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in the following season\u2019s &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa Conference League&lt;/a&gt;, subject to the club attaining a UEFA licence. However, if they have already qualified for a UEFA competition by finishing as champions or runners-up of the NIFL Premiership, or if they do not attain a UEFA licence, the Irish Cup's Europa Conference League berth is redistributed to the third-placed Premiership club, and the 4th\u20137th placed clubs participate in the Premiership's Europa Conference League play-offs.\nHistory.\nThe Irish Cup was inaugurated in the &lt;a href=\"1880%E2%80%9381%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1880\u201381 season&lt;/a&gt;, with seven clubs taking part. The draw for the first round took place on 10 January 1881, with the first ever Irish Cup matches being played on 5 February 1881. The trophy was first awarded to &lt;a href=\"Moyola%20Park%20F.C.\"&gt;Moyola Park&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=\"Castledawson\"&gt;Castledawson&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"County%20Londonderry\"&gt;County Londonderry&lt;/a&gt;) when they beat &lt;a href=\"Cliftonville%20F.C.\"&gt;Cliftonville&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=\"Belfast\"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;) 1\u20130 in the final at &lt;a href=\"Cliftonville%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Cliftonville Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt;, Belfast on 9 April 1881. Since its inception, the Irish Cup has always been, and continues to be, considered the most important such competition in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; (and, prior to 1921, &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;), second only to the &lt;a href=\"NIFL%20Premiership\"&gt;NIFL Premiership&lt;/a&gt;. The cup final is the climax of the domestic season in Northern Ireland and usually attracts the biggest attendance of any club match.\nSince the inception of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20Football%20League\"&gt;Irish Football League&lt;/a&gt; in 1890\u201391 (and excluding the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; years when the League was suspended), the Cup has been won by Irish League clubs on every occasion except three famous \u2018giant-killing\u2019 occasions when \"junior\" clubs beat senior opponents in the final: in 1928, &lt;a href=\"Willowfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Willowfield&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href=\"Larne%20F.C.\"&gt;Larne&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130; in &lt;a href=\"1954%E2%80%9355%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1955&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dundela%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundela&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href=\"Glenavon%20F.C.\"&gt;Glenavon&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130; and in 1976, &lt;a href=\"Carrick%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Carrick Rangers&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href=\"Linfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Linfield&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131. In the early years, &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; regiments stationed in Ireland entered teams such as King's Own Rifles (&lt;a href=\"Cork%20%28city%29\"&gt;Cork&lt;/a&gt;), three of which reached the final: the &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Highlanders\"&gt;Gordon Highlanders&lt;/a&gt; in 1890, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Watch\"&gt;Black Watch&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Limerick\"&gt;Limerick&lt;/a&gt;) in 1892 and the &lt;a href=\"Sherwood%20Foresters\"&gt;Sherwood Foresters&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Curragh\"&gt;Curragh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Kildare\"&gt;County Kildare&lt;/a&gt;) in 1897. The &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Highlanders\"&gt;Gordon Highlanders&lt;/a&gt; were the only Army team to win the Cup.\nBetween 1881 and 1921 when the Irish Cup was an all-Ireland competition, southern clubs (from what would become the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt; and later the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;) only won the competition four times out of a possible 41: &lt;a href=\"Shelbourne%20F.C.\"&gt;Shelbourne&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;) won three times (in 1906, 1911 and 1920); and &lt;a href=\"Bohemian%20F.C.\"&gt;Bohemians&lt;/a&gt; (also from Dublin) won it in 1908. There were two all-southern finals: Bohemians defeating Shelbourne in 1908, and Shelbourne defeating Bohemians in 1911 (both ties required replays). Shelbourne, Bohemians and &lt;a href=\"Derry%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Derry City&lt;/a&gt; are the only clubs to win \"both\" the Irish Cup and the &lt;a href=\"FAI%20Cup\"&gt;FAI Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Other Dublin clubs to compete in the Irish Cup were &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20University%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Dublin University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20James%27s%20Gate%20F.C.\"&gt;St. James's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, Dublin Association, &lt;a href=\"Tritonville%20F.C.\"&gt;Tritonville&lt;/a&gt; and Richmond Rovers.\nIn the second competition in 1881\u201382, &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Island%20F.C.%20%281881%29\"&gt;Queen's Island&lt;/a&gt; became the first Belfast club to win the Cup and it did not leave Belfast again for another 24 years, when in 1905\u201306, Shelbourne became the first club from Dublin to win it. Of the 141 competitions played to date, Belfast clubs have won the cup 104 times; 73.8% of all competitions. The last time a club from outside Belfast won the cup was in &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Coleraine%20F.C.\"&gt;Coleraine&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href=\"Cliftonville%20F.C.\"&gt;Cliftonville&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131 to win the cup for the sixth time. The cup's most successful club from outside Belfast is &lt;a href=\"Glenavon%20F.C.\"&gt;Glenavon&lt;/a&gt;, with seven wins.\nIn the early years of the competition the final was played at several different venues in Belfast, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Oval%20%28Belfast%29\"&gt;the Oval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28football%20ground%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grosvenor%20Park%2C%20Belfast\"&gt;Grosvenor Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Park%20%28Belfast%29\"&gt;Celtic Park&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Dalymount%20Park\"&gt;Dalymount Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1996, the final has been played exclusively at &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Park\"&gt;Windsor Park&lt;/a&gt;, except for the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt; finals. The 2015 final had to be switched to &lt;a href=\"The%20Oval%20%28Belfast%29\"&gt;the Oval&lt;/a&gt;, following the discovery of damage to a stand at the usual Windsor Park venue, while the 2021 final was moved to &lt;a href=\"Mourneview%20Park\"&gt;Mourneview Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lurgan\"&gt;Lurgan&lt;/a&gt; for the first time due to maintenance works at Windsor Park, including a new playing surface being laid. This was the first final to be played outside Belfast since 1975, when &lt;a href=\"Coleraine%20F.C.\"&gt;Coleraine&lt;/a&gt; won the Cup with a 1\u20130 victory over Linfield in the second replay, after 1\u20131 and 0\u20130 draws in the first two games. The first final ever played outside Belfast took place in 1903, when &lt;a href=\"Lisburn%20Distillery%20F.C.\"&gt;Distillery&lt;/a&gt; won their 7th Irish Cup with a 3\u20131 victory over &lt;a href=\"Bohemians%20F.C.\"&gt;Bohemians&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dalymount%20Park\"&gt;Dalymount Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll &lt;a href=\"Counties%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;six counties in Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; have been represented in the final. &lt;a href=\"Moyola%20Park%20F.C.\"&gt;Moyola Park&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"County%20Londonderry\"&gt;County Londonderry&lt;/a&gt; were inaugural winners in 1881. In 1921, Glenavon became the first club from &lt;a href=\"County%20Armagh\"&gt;County Armagh&lt;/a&gt; to reach the final, but no club from Armagh won the Cup until Glenavon in 1957. &lt;a href=\"County%20Down\"&gt;County Down&lt;/a&gt;'s first Cup finalists and winners were &lt;a href=\"Ards%20F.C.\"&gt;Ards&lt;/a&gt; in 1927; and &lt;a href=\"County%20Antrim\"&gt;County Antrim&lt;/a&gt;'s were &lt;a href=\"Ballymena%20F.C.\"&gt;Ballymena&lt;/a&gt; in 1929. In &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dungannon%20Swifts%20F.C.\"&gt;Dungannon Swifts&lt;/a&gt; became the first club from &lt;a href=\"County%20Tyrone\"&gt;County Tyrone&lt;/a&gt; to reach the final, and in &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ballinamallard%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Ballinamallard United&lt;/a&gt; became the first team from &lt;a href=\"County%20Fermanagh\"&gt;County Fermanagh&lt;/a&gt; to reach the final, completing the set.\nPrior to replays being abolished in the final, a replay was required to decide the winner of 21 finals, the first in 1890 after Cliftonville and the &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Highlanders\"&gt;Gordon Highlanders&lt;/a&gt; drew 2\u20132. Of the 21 finals to be replayed, eight of them required a second replay to separate the two finalists. The last time this occurred, and the last final replay ever played before they were abolished was in &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;, when Bangor defeated Ards 1\u20130 after two 1\u20131 draws. It was decided after this that there should only be \"one\" replay in which penalties would be used to determine the winner if necessary, and eventually the rules were changed to remove final replays altogether, with penalties being used if necessary after extra time in the first match. The first (and to date, only) final to be won on penalties took place in &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, when Linfield beat Dungannon Swifts 3\u20132 on penalties following a 2\u20132 draw after extra time. In 2014, the rules were changed to abolish replays from the entire competition. All ties level after 90 minutes now use 30 minutes of extra time, and if necessary, a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner.\nThe final was not played on three occasions: \nA total of 24 different clubs have won the Cup, but only 13 clubs have done so more than once. 34 different clubs have reached the final, with 12 of them appearing only once. Of those 12 clubs, five of them have won the Cup in their sole final appearance. On five occasions the same two clubs have reached the final in consecutive years: in 1885 and 1886, Distillery and &lt;a href=\"Limavady%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Alexander&lt;/a&gt;; in 1913 and 1914, Glentoran and Linfield; in 1930 and 1931, Ballymena United and Linfield; Coleraine and Glentoran in &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;; and in &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; Linfield and Crusaders. The most common final has been between Glentoran and Linfield, which has occurred 15 times. Linfield have won eight of the meetings, with Glentoran winning seven. The last time both clubs reached the final was in &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, when Linfield won 2\u20131.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, the final was broadcast live on television for the first time on BBC Northern Ireland and has been on every occasion since\n&lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Park\"&gt;Windsor Park&lt;/a&gt; has hosted the most finals (75, including replays), followed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Oval%20%28Belfast%29\"&gt;The Oval&lt;/a&gt; with 25, and &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28football%20ground%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; with 23.\nRecords.\nMost wins: 44, &lt;a href=\"Linfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Linfield&lt;/a&gt;\nMost consecutive wins: 4, &lt;a href=\"Glentoran%20F.C.\"&gt;Glentoran&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"1984%E2%80%9385%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1985%E2%80%9386%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1986%E2%80%9387%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"1987%E2%80%9388%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;)\nMost appearances in a final: 64, &lt;a href=\"Linfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Linfield&lt;/a&gt;\nMost consecutive appearances in a final: 5, &lt;a href=\"Linfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Linfield&lt;/a&gt; (1891, 1892, 1893, 1894 &amp; 1895)\nMost defeats in a final: 21, &lt;a href=\"Linfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Linfield&lt;/a&gt;\nMost consecutive defeats in a final: 3, &lt;a href=\"Linfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Linfield&lt;/a&gt; (1975, 1976 &amp; 1977)\nBiggest win in a final: &lt;a href=\"Linfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Linfield&lt;/a&gt; 10\u20131 &lt;a href=\"Bohemians%20F.C.\"&gt;Bohemians&lt;/a&gt; (1895)\nLongest gap between wins in a final: 70 years, &lt;a href=\"Cliftonville%20F.C.\"&gt;Cliftonville&lt;/a&gt; (1909 and &lt;a href=\"1978%E2%80%9379%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt;)\nLongest gap between appearances in a final: 55 years, &lt;a href=\"Bangor%20F.C.\"&gt;Bangor&lt;/a&gt; (1938 and &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;)\nMost appearances in a final without winning: 6, &lt;a href=\"Larne%20F.C.\"&gt;Larne&lt;/a&gt; (1928, 1935, &lt;a href=\"1986%E2%80%9387%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1988%E2%80%9389%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;)\nMost common pair of finalists: &lt;a href=\"Belfast%27s%20Big%20Two\"&gt;Glentoran v Linfield&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 15 times (1899, 1913, 1914, 1916, 1919, 1923, 1932, 1942, 1945, 1966, 1973, &lt;a href=\"1982%E2%80%9383%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1984%E2%80%9385%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Irish%20Cup\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;)\nFinal results.\nKey:\nStatistics.\nPerformance by club.\n\"Clubs in italics no longer compete for the cup.
