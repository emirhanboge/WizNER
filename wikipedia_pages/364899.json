    "text": "Ermanaric (; or \"Hermanaricus\"; ; , ; died 376) was a &lt;a href=\"Greuthungi\"&gt;Greuthungi&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;a href=\"Goths\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20kingship\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; who before the &lt;a href=\"Huns\"&gt;Hunnic&lt;/a&gt; invasion evidently ruled a sizable portion of &lt;a href=\"Oium\"&gt;Oium&lt;/a&gt;, the part of &lt;a href=\"Scythia\"&gt;Scythia&lt;/a&gt; inhabited by the Goths at the time. He is mentioned in two Roman sources: the contemporary writings of &lt;a href=\"Ammianus%20Marcellinus\"&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus&lt;/a&gt;, and in \"&lt;a href=\"Getica\"&gt;Getica&lt;/a&gt;\" by the sixth-century historian &lt;a href=\"Jordanes\"&gt;Jordanes&lt;/a&gt;. He also appears in a fictionalized form in later &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20heroic%20legend\"&gt;Germanic heroic legend&lt;/a&gt;s.\nModern historians disagree on the size of Ermanaric's realm. &lt;a href=\"Herwig%20Wolfram\"&gt;Herwig Wolfram&lt;/a&gt; postulates that he at one point ruled a realm stretching from the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; as far eastwards as the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20Mountains\"&gt;Ural Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Heather\"&gt;Peter Heather&lt;/a&gt; is skeptical of the claim that Ermanaric ruled all Goths except the &lt;a href=\"Tervingi\"&gt;Tervingi&lt;/a&gt;, and furthermore points to the fact that such an enormous empire would have been larger than any known Gothic political unit, that it would have left bigger traces in the sources and that the sources on which the claim is based are not nearly reliable enough to be taken at face value.\nEtymology.\nThe first element of the name \"Ermanaric\" appears to be based on the &lt;a href=\"Proto-Germanic\"&gt;Proto-Germanic&lt;/a&gt; root \"*&lt;a href=\"wikt%3AReconstruction%3AProto-Germanic/ermunaz\"&gt;ermena-&lt;/a&gt;\", meaning 'universal'. The second element is from the element \"*-&lt;a href=\"wikt%3AReconstruction%3AProto-Germanic/r%C4%ABks\"&gt;r\u012bks&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20language\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3A%F0%90%8D%82%F0%90%8C%B4%F0%90%8C%B9%F0%90%8C%BA%F0%90%8D%83\"&gt;reiks&lt;/a&gt;\", meaning 'ruler'; this is found frequently in Gothic royal names.\nIn Roman sources.\nAccording to Ammianus, Ermanaric was \"a most warlike king\" who eventually committed suicide, faced with the aggression of the &lt;a href=\"Alani\"&gt;Alani&lt;/a&gt; and of the &lt;a href=\"Hun\"&gt;Hun&lt;/a&gt;s, who invaded his territories in the 370s. Ammianus says he \"ruled over extensively wide and fertile regions\". Ammianus also says that after Ermanaric's death, a certain &lt;a href=\"Vithimiris\"&gt;Vithimiris&lt;/a&gt; was elected as the new king.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Jordanes\"&gt;Jordanes&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"Getica\"&gt;Getica&lt;/a&gt;\", Ermanaric ruled the realm of &lt;a href=\"Oium\"&gt;Oium&lt;/a&gt;. Jordanes describes him as a \"Gothic &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20the%20Great\"&gt;Alexander&lt;/a&gt;\" who \"ruled all the nations of &lt;a href=\"Scythia\"&gt;Scythia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germania\"&gt;Germania&lt;/a&gt; as they were his own\". Jordanes also states that the king put to death a young woman named Sunilda (&lt;a href=\"Svanhildr\"&gt;Svanhildr&lt;/a&gt;) with the use of horses, because of her infidelity. Thereupon her two brothers, Sarus and &lt;a href=\"Ammius\"&gt;Ammius&lt;/a&gt;, severely wounded Ermanaric, leaving him unfit to defend his kingdom from Hunnic incursions. Variations of this legend had a profound effect on medieval Germanic literature, including that of England and &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Jonakr%27s%20sons\"&gt;Jonakr's sons&lt;/a&gt;). Jordanes claims that he successfully ruled the &lt;a href=\"Goths\"&gt;Goths&lt;/a&gt; until his death at the age of 110.\n&lt;a href=\"Edward%20Gibbon\"&gt;Edward Gibbon&lt;/a&gt; gives the version of Ammianus and Jordanes as historical, reporting that Ermanaric successively conquered, during a reign of about 30 years from AD 337 to 367, the &lt;a href=\"Thervingi\"&gt;west-goths&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Heruli\"&gt;Heruli&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Venedi\"&gt;Venedi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Aestii\"&gt;Aestii&lt;/a&gt;, establishing a kingdom which ranged from the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt;; and died at the age of 110 of a wound inflicted by the brothers of a woman whom he had cruelly executed for her husband's revolt, being succeeded by his brother &lt;a href=\"Vithimiris\"&gt;Vithimiris&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Germanic sources and legends.\nErmanaric appears in a variety of different &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20heroic%20legend\"&gt;Germanic heroic legend&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIormunrek (J\u00f6rmunrekkr) is the Norse form of the name. Ermanaric appears in &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norse%20mythology\"&gt;Scandinavian&lt;/a&gt; legend. In the former, the poem &lt;a href=\"Beowulf\"&gt;Beowulf&lt;/a&gt; focused on the image of \"Eormenric's wiles and hatred\". He is described in the tenth century poem &lt;a href=\"Deor\"&gt;Deor&lt;/a&gt; as a powerful but perilous king: \"We have heard of the wolfish mind of Eormanric: far and wide he ruled the people of the realm of the Goths: he was a cruel king\".\nErmanaric also appears in the Norse sources, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Thidreks%20Saga\"&gt;Thidreks Saga&lt;/a&gt;\", in which he is ill-advised by his counsellors to put his own wife to death for supposed adultery with his son, for which revenge is taken by his brothers-in-law.\nThe death of Swanhild (Svanhildr Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir) and Ermanaric's (J\u00f6rmunrek) subsequent death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Jonakr%27s%20sons\"&gt;Jonakr's sons&lt;/a&gt; occupies an important place in the world of Germanic legend. The tale is retold in many northern European stories, including the Icelandic &lt;a href=\"Poetic%20Edda\"&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ham%C3%B0ism%C3%A1l\"&gt;Ham\u00f0ism\u00e1l&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gu%C3%B0r%C3%BAnarhv%C3%B6t\"&gt;Gu\u00f0r\u00fanarhv\u00f6t&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Prose%20Edda\"&gt;Prose Edda&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Volsunga%20Saga\"&gt;Volsunga Saga&lt;/a&gt;; the Norwegian &lt;a href=\"Ragnarsdr%C3%A1pa\"&gt;Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa&lt;/a&gt;; the Danish &lt;a href=\"Gesta%20Danorum\"&gt;Gesta Danorum&lt;/a&gt;; and the German &lt;a href=\"Nibelungenlied\"&gt;Nibelungenlied&lt;/a&gt;\nand &lt;a href=\"Annals%20of%20Quedlinburg\"&gt;Annals of Quedlinburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Norse \"Thidreks Saga\", Ermanaric is ill-advised by his treacherous counsellor Bicke, Bikka, Sifka, or Seveke (who wants revenge for the rape of his wife by Ermanaric), with the result that the king puts his own wife to death for supposed adultery with his son; he is thereafter crippled by his brothers-in-law in revenge.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20High%20German\"&gt;Middle High German&lt;/a&gt; poems \"&lt;a href=\"Dietrichs%20Flucht\"&gt;Dietrichs Flucht&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Rabenschlacht\"&gt;Rabenschlacht&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Alpharts%20Tod\"&gt;Alpharts Tod&lt;/a&gt;\" about &lt;a href=\"Dietrich%20von%20Bern\"&gt;Dietrich of Bern&lt;/a&gt;, Ermanaric is Dietrich's uncle who has driven his nephew into exile. The early modern &lt;a href=\"Low%20German\"&gt;Low German&lt;/a&gt; poem \"&lt;a href=\"Ermenrichs%20Tod\"&gt;Ermenrichs Tod&lt;/a&gt;\" recounts a garbled version of Ermanaric's death reminiscent of the scene told in Jordanes and Scandinavian legend.\nName.\nErmanaric's &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20name\"&gt;Gothic name&lt;/a&gt; is reconstructed as \"*Airmanareiks\". \nIt is recorded in the various Latinized forms:\nIn medieval Germanic epics, the name appears as:\nSince the name \"Hei\u00f0rekr\" may have been confused with Ermanaric through folk etymology he is possibly identical to \"Hei\u00f0rekr Ulfhamr\" of the &lt;a href=\"Hervarar%20saga\"&gt;Hervarar saga&lt;/a&gt;."
