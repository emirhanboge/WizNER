It was the first historical game by Metagaming Concepts, which to that point had specialized in fantasy and science fiction games, and was the first of five microgames in MetaGaming's MicroHistory series of &lt;a href=\"Microgames\"&gt;Microgames&lt;/a&gt;. The game rules include ten scenarios.\nComponents.\nThe &lt;a href=\"microgame\"&gt;microgame&lt;/a&gt; game box contains:\nThe counters represent:\nGameplay.\nUnits are set up according to the scenario. Turns are divided into: \nPublication history.\nMetagaming Concepts entered the games industry in 1974 with the science fiction game \"&lt;a href=\"Stellar%20Conquest\"&gt;Stellar Conquest&lt;/a&gt;\", and followed this with other science fiction and fantasy microgames such as \"&lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"G.E.V.%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;G.E.V.&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Melee%20%28game%29\"&gt;Melee&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Wizard%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1980, Metagaming published their first historical simulation, \"Rommel's Panzers\", a microgame designed by Roger Damon. Metagaming followed this with four other games in the MicroHistory series: \"&lt;a href=\"Ram%20Speed\"&gt;Ram Speed: Naval Warfare in the Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Stalin's Tanks: Armor Battles on the Russian Front\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fury%20of%20the%20Norsemen\"&gt;The Fury of the Norsemen&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"Fire When Ready\".\nReception.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Space%20Gamer\"&gt;The Space Gamer&lt;/a&gt;\" No. 30., Nick Schuessler thought the game a bit simplistic, but concluded, \"\"Rommel's Panzers\" plays it safe with tried and true systems, no infantry, and no terrain. [...] If you don't own any other WWII tactical games, \"Rommel's Panzers\" provides a good introduction to this level of play at a reasonable price.\"\nIn Issue 28 of \"&lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20%28wargaming%20magazine%29\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;\", Paul King found the components a bit primitive, with misprinted coordinates on the map, and misprinted counters. However, he found the rules easy to assimilate, especially if the scenarios were played in order, since new rules were introduced in successive scenarios. He also thought that \"As a tank simulation, even if you know little of tank warfare, you become aware of what is right and wrong. A mad rush by all available tanks will achieve little even in the face of a few emplaced guns.\" He concluded on a positive note, saying, \"the game adheres to Metagaming's principles \u2014 quick and easy to play. As a new venture for the firm this is a good game, covering a theatre which has had little exposure at the tactical level.\""
