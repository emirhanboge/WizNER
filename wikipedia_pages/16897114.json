    "title": "Transport in Madeira",
    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Madeira\"&gt;Madeira&lt;/a&gt; islands and &lt;a href=\"Funchal\"&gt;Funchal&lt;/a&gt; have an extensive public transportation system. Travel between the two main islands is by plane or by ferries, the latter also allowing for the transportation of vehicles. Visiting the interior of the islands is now easy, due to major road developments, known as the Vias r\u00e1pidas, on the islands during &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;'s economic boom.\n&lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; citizens of the &lt;a href=\"Schengen%20Treaty\"&gt;Schengen Treaty&lt;/a&gt; area can enter the islands freely, while those from other regions need identification.\nHuman-powered transport.\nIn the past Madeira had a mode of transport that no longer exists called a hammock &lt;a href=\"Litter%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;litter&lt;/a&gt;. It was introduced by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Reid%20Kalley\"&gt;Robert Reid Kalley&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century.\nAir transport.\nThe islands have two airports, one in &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Cruz%2C%20Madeira\"&gt;Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt; (known as &lt;a href=\"Madeira%20Airport\"&gt;Funchal Airport&lt;/a&gt; (FNC)) on the Island of Madeira and the other in the city of &lt;a href=\"Vila%20Baleira\"&gt;Vila Baleira&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Porto%20Santo%20Island\"&gt;Porto Santo Island&lt;/a&gt;. Flights to the islands are mostly made from &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porto\"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt;, but there are also direct flights from other major European cities and other countries, like &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first seaplane to land in Madeira was &lt;a href=\"Felixstowe%20F.3\"&gt;Felixstowe F.3&lt;/a&gt;, captained &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Viegas%20Gago%20Coutinho\"&gt;Carlos Viegas Gago Coutinho&lt;/a&gt; by on 22 March 1921, Madeira then had regular &lt;a href=\"Seaplane\"&gt;Seaplane&lt;/a&gt; services from 1949 to 1958 which were operated by &lt;a href=\"Aquila%20Airways\"&gt;Aquila Airways&lt;/a&gt;, which had flights from &lt;a href=\"Southampton\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jersey\"&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and Lisbon to Madeira. Winston Churchill used the service regularly. Captain &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Frank%20Broadbent\"&gt;Harry Frank Broadbent&lt;/a&gt; who flew as captain for &lt;a href=\"Aquila%20Airways\"&gt;Aquila Airways&lt;/a&gt;, then worked for &lt;a href=\"ARTOP%20Linhas%20A%C3%A9reas\"&gt;ARTOP Linhas A\u00e9reas&lt;/a&gt; as an instructor pilot, ARTOP took over the route in 1958, also operated seaplanes from Lisbon to Madeira.\nOn 9 November 1958, Captain &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Frank%20Broadbent\"&gt;Harry Frank Broadbent&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by co-pilot Thomas Rowell, four other crew and 30 passengers, piloted &lt;a href=\"Martin%20PBM%20Mariner\"&gt;Martin PBM Mariner&lt;/a&gt; (CS-THB, named \"Porto Santo\") owned by &lt;a href=\"ARTOP%20Linhas%20A%C3%A9reas\"&gt;ARTOP Linhas A\u00e9reas&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Cabo%20Ruivo%20Seaplane%20Base\"&gt;Cabo Ruivo Seaplane Base&lt;/a&gt; near Lisbon, headed for Funchal. About an hour into the flight, when it would have been over the Atlantic Ocean about 150 miles SW of Lisbon, a radio message code \"QUG\" was received, meaning \"I am forced to land immediately\". After several days of searching by air and sea by US and Portuguese authorities, no further trace was found of the aircraft or its crew or passengers.\n&lt;a href=\"Cristiano%20Ronaldo%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Funchal Airport&lt;/a&gt; became operative in July 1964. It was dreaded among airliner pilots for its runway, which was not only short (the largest planes that could be accommodated were the &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A320\"&gt;Airbus A320&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20737\"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt;) but was also built on a high &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aembankment\"&gt;embankment&lt;/a&gt; which fell away abruptly towards the sea. It often experienced &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20draft\"&gt;updrafts&lt;/a&gt; which tended to lift landing aircraft in an unpredictable fashion. In an accident on November 19, 1977 that killed over 150 people, &lt;a href=\"TAP%20Portugal%20Flight%20425\"&gt;TAP Portugal Flight 425&lt;/a&gt;, landing in unfavorable weather, overshot the runway and dropped off the cliff. Subsequently, the runway was realigned and extended from 1,800m to 2,481m, enabling most modern passenger airplanes (including the &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20747-400\"&gt;Boeing 747-400&lt;/a&gt;) to visit the island.\nWater transport.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Funchal\"&gt;Port of Funchal&lt;/a&gt; was the only major port in Madeira until 2007 when it became fully dedicated to passenger transport \u2013 cruise ships and ferries \u2013 and other tourist-related boats and yachts. In that year all remaining fishing activity and cargo trade was moved to the newly developed port of &lt;a href=\"Cani%C3%A7al\"&gt;Cani\u00e7al&lt;/a&gt;, to the east.\nA ferry service between Funchal and &lt;a href=\"Portim%C3%A3o\"&gt;Portim\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt;, on the mainland, provided by &lt;a href=\"Naviera%20Armas\"&gt;Naviera Armas&lt;/a&gt; sailed weekly from 2008, but was discontinued in 2013 due to a dispute over harbour fees. In the summer of 2018 it was re-instated, but as a seasonal service from July to September, being operated by Grupo Sousa using Naviera Armas's ship called Volc\u00e1n de Tijarafe, that provided the crossing prior to the 2013 discontinuation, with a maximum speed of 23 &lt;a href=\"Knot%20%28unit%29\"&gt;knots&lt;/a&gt; the crossing takes around 24 hours.\nA ferry called \"Lobo Marinho\" runs in two hours between Funchal and &lt;a href=\"Porto%20Santo\"&gt;Porto Santo&lt;/a&gt; Island.\nFunchal is frequently used as a stop-over by transatlantic ships, en route from Europe to the Caribbean, as it is the northernmost Atlantic island that lies in the path of the &lt;a href=\"Westerlies\"&gt;Westerlies&lt;/a&gt;.\nCable transport.\nIn Funchal there are two &lt;a href=\"aerial%20tramway\"&gt;aerial tramway&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Funchal%20Cable%20Car\"&gt;Funchal Cable Car&lt;/a&gt; and a second aerial tramway, which went in service in 2005.\nPreviously there was a steam-powered &lt;a href=\"cog%20railway\"&gt;cog railway&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Monte%20Railway\"&gt;Monte Railway&lt;/a&gt;) from Funchal to &lt;a href=\"Monte%20%28Funchal%29\"&gt;Monte&lt;/a&gt;, which operated between 1893 and 1943, and went further up to &lt;a href=\"Terreiro%20da%20Luta\"&gt;Terreiro da Luta&lt;/a&gt; at 867 m above sea level.\nLand transport.\nBus companies such as &lt;a href=\"Hor%C3%A1rios%20do%20Funchal\"&gt;Hor\u00e1rios do Funchal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rodoeste\"&gt;Rodoeste&lt;/a&gt; and SAM (&lt;a href=\"Sociedade%20de%20autom%C3%B3veis%20da%20Madeira\"&gt;Sociedade de autom\u00f3veis da Madeira&lt;/a&gt;) have been operating for over one hundred years, and they have regularly scheduled routes to all points of interest on the island.\nThe \"Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Regional dos Transportes Terrestres\" is the department of the regional government responsible for land transportation in the autonomous region."
