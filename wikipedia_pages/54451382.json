    "text": "Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah III, born Mahmud Khan was a &lt;a href=\"sultan\"&gt;sultan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Muzaffarids%20%28Gujarat%29\"&gt;Muzaffarid dynasty&lt;/a&gt; who reigned over the &lt;a href=\"Gujarat%20Sultanate\"&gt;Gujarat Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;, a late medieval kingdom in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; from 1537 to 1554. He had to battle frequently with his nobles who were interested in independence, especially Darya Kh\u00e1n and Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk. He was killed by one of his servants.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Bahadur%20Shah%20of%20Gujarat\"&gt;Bahadur Shah&lt;/a&gt; had no son, hence there was some uncertainty regarding succession after his death. &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20Zaman%20Mirza\"&gt;Muhammad Zaman Mirza&lt;/a&gt;, the fugitive Mughal prince made his claim on the ground that Bahadur's mother adopted him as her son. The nobles selected Bahadur's nephew &lt;a href=\"Faruqi%20dynasty%23Miran%20Muhammad%20Shah%20I\"&gt;Miran Muhammad Shah I&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Khandesh\"&gt;Khandesh&lt;/a&gt; as his successor, but he died on his way to Gujarat. Finally, the nobles selected Mahmud Khan, the son of Bahadur's brother Latif Khan as his successor and he ascended to the throne as Mahmud Shah III on 10 May 1538, when only eleven years of age.\nReign.\nThe government was carried on by Darya Kh\u00e1n and Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk as his regents. Darya Kh\u00e1n resolved to overthrow Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk and acquire supreme power. With this object he obtained an order from the king, whom, on the pretence of a hunting expedition, he removed from &lt;a href=\"Ahmedabad\"&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt;, directing Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk to retire to his estates in &lt;a href=\"Kathiawar\"&gt;Jhalawad&lt;/a&gt;. Six months later, taking the Sult\u00e1n with him, Darya Kh\u00e1n led an army into Jhalawad, and defeating Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk in a battle at &lt;a href=\"Patdi\"&gt;Patdi&lt;/a&gt;, fifty two miles west of \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d, pursued him to &lt;a href=\"Burhanpur\"&gt;Burhanpur&lt;/a&gt;, and there defeated Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk's ally the ruler of &lt;a href=\"Khandesh\"&gt;Khandesh&lt;/a&gt; and forced Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk to fly to &lt;a href=\"Malwa\"&gt;Malwa&lt;/a&gt;. After this success Darya Kh\u00e1n became absorbed in pleasure, and resigned the management of the kingdom to \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n Lodhi. The king, dissembling his dissatisfaction at the way he was treated, pretended to take no interest in affairs of state. \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n Lodhi, seeing the carelessness of Darya Kh\u00e1n, began to entertain ambitions, and retiring to his estate of &lt;a href=\"Dhandhuka\"&gt;Dhandhuka&lt;/a&gt;, invited the king to join him. The king, Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h, believing him to be in earnest, contrived to escape from surveillance and joined \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n. On discovering the king's flight, Darya Kh\u00e1n raised to the throne a descendant of \u00c1hmed Sh\u00e1h by the title of Muzaffar Sh\u00e1h, and striking coin in his name set out with an army towards Dhandh\u00faka. \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n and the king met him at Dh\u00far in &lt;a href=\"Dholka\"&gt;Dholka&lt;/a&gt;, and a battle was fought in which Mahm\u00fad and \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n were defeated. The king fled to &lt;a href=\"Ranpur%2C%20Gujarat\"&gt;Ranpur&lt;/a&gt;, and thence to &lt;a href=\"Paliad\"&gt;Paliad&lt;/a&gt;, while \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n fled to &lt;a href=\"Sadra%2C%20Gandhinagar\"&gt;Sadra&lt;/a&gt;. Darya Kh\u00e1n occupied Dhandhuka; but his men, dissatisfied at being placed in opposition to the king, rapidly deserted, some joining \u00c1lam Khan and some Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h. Soon after the king joined \u00c1lam Khan and marched on \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d, whither Darya Kh\u00e1n had preceded them. The citizens closed the gates against Darya Kh\u00e1n, but he forced an entry by way of the Burh\u00e1npur wicket. Hearing of the king's approach Darya Kh\u00e1n fled to Mub\u00e1rak Sh\u00e1h at Burh\u00e1npur, leaving his family and treasure in the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Champaner\"&gt;Champaner&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe king entered \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d, and soon after captured Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner. \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n now obtained the recall of Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk, who received a grant of &lt;a href=\"Bharuch\"&gt;Bharuch&lt;/a&gt; and the port of &lt;a href=\"Surat\"&gt;Surat&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly afterwards Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h began to show favour to men of low degree, especially to one Charji, a birdcatcher, whom he ennobled by the title of Muh\u00e1fiz Kh\u00e1n. Charji counselled Mahm\u00fad to put to death Sult\u00e1n Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Lodhi and Shuj\u00e1\u00e2t Kh\u00e1n, two of the principal nobles; and the king, without consulting his ministers, caused these men to be executed. The nobles joining besieged Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h in his palace, and demanded that Muh\u00e1fiz Kh\u00e1n should be surrendered to them, but the king refused to give him up. The nobles then demanded an audience, and this the king granted, Muh\u00e1fiz Kh\u00e1n, though warned of his danger, being present. On entering the royal presence \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n signalled to his followers to slay Muh\u00e1fiz, and he was killed in spite of the king's remonstrances. Mahm\u00fad then attempted to kill himself, but was prevented and placed under guard, and the chief nobles took it in turn to watch him. Strife soon arose between \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n and Muj\u00e1hid Kh\u00e1n and his brother, and the two latter nobles contrived the king's escape and sacked the houses of \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n and his followers. \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n escaped to &lt;a href=\"Pethapur\"&gt;Pethapur&lt;/a&gt; in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha. He then joined Darya Kh\u00e1n, whom he called from the Deccan, and obtained help in money from Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk of Surat and from \u00c1lp Kh\u00e1n of Dholka. Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk wrote to the Sult\u00e1n asking forgiveness for the rebels.\nBut before the Sult\u00e1n, who was mercifully disposed, could grant them pardon, \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n and Darya Kh\u00e1n again committed themselves by acts of open revolt. The Sult\u00e1n displeased with the part Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk had taken in the rising summoned him to Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner where, with the Sult\u00e1n's connivance, his camp was given over to pillage. The Sult\u00e1n disclaimed all knowledge of this attack and at Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk's request allowed him to go on pilgrimage to &lt;a href=\"Mecca\"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt;. In 1545 as he was preparing to start for pilgrimage, Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk was killed. He was succeeded in Surat by Khud\u00e1wand Kh\u00e1n R\u00fami, who had held Surat under him, and who, in spite of Portuguese opposition and intrigue, had five years before completed the building of &lt;a href=\"Surat%20Castle\"&gt;Surat Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, \u00c1lam Kh\u00e1n and Darya Kh\u00e1n were driven from Gujar\u00e1t and forced to take shelter with the sovereign of Dehli. The king now appointed as his own minister Afzal Kh\u00e1n, the minister of the late Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, and though Afzal Kh\u00e1n lived in retirement, his counsel was taken on measures of importance. Other great nobles were Sayad Mub\u00e1rak, Fateh Kh\u00e1n Baloch, and Abdul Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, who received the title of \u00cdtim\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, and was so entirely in the Sult\u00e1n's confidence that he was admitted to the harem. Mahm\u00fad now consulted \u00c1sif Kh\u00e1n as to the propriety of conquering M\u00e1lwa.\n\u00c1sif Kh\u00e1n advised him rather to deprive the R\u00e1jput chiefs and proprietors of their \"w\u00e1ntas\" or hereditary lands. The attempt to follow this advice stirred to resistance the chief men of &lt;a href=\"Idar%20State\"&gt;Idar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sirohi\"&gt;Sirohi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dungarpur\"&gt;Dungarpur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banswada\"&gt;Banswada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lunavada\"&gt;Lunavada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rajpipla\"&gt;Rajpipla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dahod\"&gt;Dahod&lt;/a&gt;, and the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Mahi%20river\"&gt;Mahi river&lt;/a&gt;. The king strengthened his line of outposts, establishing one at Sirohi and another at \u00cddar, besides fresh posts in other places. At the same time he began to persecute the Hindus, allowing them to be killed on the slightest pretence, branding R\u00e1jputs and Kolis, forcing them to wear a red rag on the right sleeve, forbidding them to ride in \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d, and punishing the celebration of &lt;a href=\"Holi\"&gt;Holi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diwali\"&gt;Diwali&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1554 Burh\u00e1n, a servant of the king's, conceived the idea of killing him and reigning in his stead. He accordingly gave his master an intoxicating drug, and when he was overcome with sleep stabbed him to the heart. Then summoning the principal nobles in the king's name, he put to death \u00c1saf Kh\u00e1n the prime minister and twelve others, and endeavoured to have himself accepted as Sult\u00e1n. No one aided him; even his accomplices deserted him. Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk R\u00fami, Ulugh Kh\u00e1n, and others joined to oppose him, and when marching against them he was cut down by Shirw\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n. Mahm\u00fad's persecutions had raised such bitter hate among the Hindus, that they regarded Burh\u00e1n as a saviour. Mahm\u00fad moved his capital from \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d to &lt;a href=\"Mahemdavad\"&gt;Mehmudabad&lt;/a&gt;, eighteen miles south of \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d where he built a palace and enclosed a deer park. At each corner of the park he raised a palace the stone walls and ceilings of which were ornamented with beautiful and precious gold traceries and arabesques. His strict regard for public morals led him to forbid Muslim women visiting saints\u2019 tombs as the practice gave rise to irregularities. He died at the age of twenty-eight after a reign of eighteen years."
