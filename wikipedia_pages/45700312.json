    "text": "Peter Victor Ferdinand Cazalet &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20Lieutenant\"&gt;DL&lt;/a&gt; (15 January 1907 \u2013 29 May 1973) was a British &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;er, &lt;a href=\"jockey\"&gt;jockey&lt;/a&gt;, racehorse owner and &lt;a href=\"horse%20trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Shipbourne\"&gt;Shipbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;. He played &lt;a href=\"first-class%20cricket\"&gt;first-class cricket&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Kent County Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Marylebone Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;. He served in the &lt;a href=\"Guards%20Armoured%20Division\"&gt;Guards Armoured Division&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, reaching the rank of Major. Post-war, he trained many horses owned by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20the%20Queen%20Mother\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother&lt;/a&gt; and other notable owners. He was &lt;a href=\"British%20jump%20racing%20Champion%20Trainer\"&gt;British jump racing Champion Trainer&lt;/a&gt; on three occasions.\nPersonal life.\nPeter Victor Ferdinand Cazalet was born at &lt;a href=\"Fairlawne\"&gt;Fairlawne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shipbourne\"&gt;Shipbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; on 15 January 1907. He was the third son and youngest child of &lt;a href=\"William%20Marshall%20Cazalet\"&gt;William Marshall Cazalet&lt;/a&gt; and Maud Cazalet. His brothers were Edward and &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Cazalet\"&gt;Victor&lt;/a&gt;; his sister was &lt;a href=\"Thelma%20Cazalet\"&gt;Thelma&lt;/a&gt;. Edward was killed in action in 1916.; Victor was killed in a plane crash in 1943. He was educated at &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;Christ Church, Oxford&lt;/a&gt;. Cazalet was good at racquet sports and &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;, playing &lt;a href=\"lawn%20tennis\"&gt;lawn tennis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rackets%20%28sport%29\"&gt;rackets&lt;/a&gt;.\nCazalet's father died on 22 October 1932. Shortly afterwards, it was announced that Peter would marry Leonora Wodehouse, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"P.%20G.%20Wodehouse\"&gt;P. G. Wodehouse&lt;/a&gt;. They were married at &lt;a href=\"St%20Giles%27%20Church%2C%20Shipbourne\"&gt;St Giles' Church, Shipbourne&lt;/a&gt;, on 14 December 1932. His brother Victor was the best man. They had a son, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Cazalet\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt;, and a daughter, Sheran. Edward in later life became a &lt;a href=\"high%20court\"&gt;high court&lt;/a&gt; judge; Sheran married &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Hornby\"&gt;Sir Simon Hornby&lt;/a&gt; in 1967.\nLeonora died in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; on 16 May 1944 during a routine &lt;a href=\"surgery\"&gt;operation&lt;/a&gt;. Cazalet was given a few days leave from the army to attend her funeral. Leonora was cremated and her ashes were scattered at Fairlawne. A window in St Giles' Church is dedicated to her.\nIn 1949, Cazalet married Zara Strutt, the former wife of &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Strutt%2C%204th%20Baron%20Belper\"&gt;Lord Belper&lt;/a&gt;, and daughter of &lt;a href=\"Mainwaring%20baronets\"&gt;Sir Harry Mainwaring&lt;/a&gt;. They had three sons, although one, David, died in infancy. He is commemorated by a silver cross in St Giles' Church. In 1957, Cazalet was nominated for the position of &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff%20of%20Kent\"&gt;High Sheriff of Kent&lt;/a&gt;, a position to which he was appointed in 1960. Zara Cazalet died in 2004 at the age of 87.\nCricket.\nAs a cricketer, Cazalet was a right-handed batsman, sometimes playing as an opener. He played for Eton and scored a century in the &lt;a href=\"Eton%20v%20Harrow\"&gt;Eton v Harrow&lt;/a&gt; cricket match at &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s\"&gt;Lord's&lt;/a&gt; in July 1926. \"&lt;a href=\"Wisden\"&gt;Wisden&lt;/a&gt;\", in its 1927 review of public school cricket, wrote that he had been \"at once the most successful and the best\" of the school's batsmen: \"He has the quickness of foot and the nicety of timing that one expects in a good &lt;a href=\"Racquets%20%28sport%29\"&gt;racquets&lt;/a&gt; player, but his defence was also good and he was clever at forcing the ball to the on.\" In 1926 he played one Second XI match for Kent and in September 1927 played at &lt;a href=\"The%20Oval\"&gt;The Oval&lt;/a&gt; in a match between the Young Amateurs of Kent versus the Young Amateurs of Surrey, scoring 117 runs.\nWhilst at Oxford, Cazalet played &lt;a href=\"first-class%20cricket\"&gt;first-class cricket&lt;/a&gt; regularly during 1927 for the &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Oxford University side&lt;/a&gt;. Against &lt;a href=\"Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt; he shared in a first-wicket partnership of 207 with &lt;a href=\"Aidan%20Crawley\"&gt;Aidan Crawley&lt;/a&gt;, although he contributed only 66 runs, Crawley making 150. The following week against &lt;a href=\"Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt; his innings was cited by \"Wisden\" as the brightest part of a disappointing batting performance by the University. Following these innings he was awarded his &lt;a href=\"Blue%20%28university%20sport%29\"&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt; for cricket and appeared in the &lt;a href=\"University%20Match%20%28cricket%29\"&gt;University Match&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a preview of the 1928 season in \"The Times\", Cazalet was expected to be one of the mainstays of University batting line-up. In a move that was not uncommon at the time, as an established Oxford player he was \"stood down\" from the early-season match against &lt;a href=\"Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Kent County Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;, appearing instead for the county side. He responded by scoring 150, sharing a partnership of 204 with &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Woolley\"&gt;Frank Woolley&lt;/a&gt;. \"The Times\" commented that Cazalet was not even overshadowed by Woolley, one of Kent's greatest players. Cazalet returned to the Oxford side for most of the rest of the university season, but was not successful, and before the end of June he had lost his place in the side and was not picked for the 1928 University Match.\nCazalet did not play any first-class cricket between 1929 and 1931, but reappeared in two matches for Kent in 1932 without making much impact. In all, Cazalet played in 22 first-class matches from 1927 to 1932, scoring 744 runs at an &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28cricket%29\"&gt;average&lt;/a&gt; of 21.88 runs per innings.\nAs well as gaining a cricket blue at Oxford, Cazalet also won blues in racquets, tennis and squash. He was considered a \"fine all-round sportsman\" in his \"Wisden\" obituary.\nPre-war racing career.\nCazalet started his career as a jockey in &lt;a href=\"point-to-point%20racing\"&gt;point-to-point racing&lt;/a&gt;. He came second on Beau Geste at the North Cotswold Hunt in April 1929. In 1930, he moved up to &lt;a href=\"National%20Hunt%20racing\"&gt;National Hunt racing&lt;/a&gt;. He rode Rocquefort II at &lt;a href=\"Haydock%20Park%20Racecourse\"&gt;Haydock Park&lt;/a&gt; in December of that year. At this time, Cazalet was building a stable of &lt;a href=\"Steeplechase%20%28horse%20racing%29\"&gt;steeplechase&lt;/a&gt;rs at Fairlawne. They were trained by Harry Whiteman. Cazalet gave &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Taylor\"&gt;Elizabeth Taylor&lt;/a&gt; instruction in &lt;a href=\"equestrianism\"&gt;horse-riding&lt;/a&gt; when she was a girl.\nCazalet rode in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20National\"&gt;Grand National&lt;/a&gt; three times. He rode Master Orange in 1934, and Emancipator in 1935 and 1937.\nIn November 1937, Cazalet announced he would retire from riding as an amateur jockey due to pressures of his business interests. He remained an owner, with Whiteman continuing to train his horses. One of Cazalet's final runners before war broke out was at &lt;a href=\"Folkestone%20Racecourse\"&gt;Folkestone&lt;/a&gt;, where French Beggar came third on 4 May 1939.\nWartime career.\nFollowing the outbreak of war in 1939, Cazalet joined the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Artillery\"&gt;Royal Artillery&lt;/a&gt;. He transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Guards\"&gt;Welsh Guards&lt;/a&gt;, along with his friend &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Bingham%20Mildmay%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Mildmay%20of%20Flete\"&gt;Anthony Mildmay&lt;/a&gt;. In 1941, the &lt;a href=\"Guards%20Armoured%20Division\"&gt;Guards Armoured Division&lt;/a&gt; was formed under the command of Sir &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Leese\"&gt;Oliver Leese&lt;/a&gt; and Cazalet was transferred to the new unit. The Armoured Guards landed at &lt;a href=\"Arromanches\"&gt;Arromanches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manche\"&gt;Manche&lt;/a&gt;, France on 25 June 1944 and served as a reconnaissance unit during the push across Europe before the German surrender in May 1945. In February 1945, it was reported that Cazalet had been wounded in action. Both Cazalet and Mildmay were involved in an action at &lt;a href=\"Visselh%C3%B6vede\"&gt;Visselh\u00f6vede&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Saxony\"&gt;Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt;, Germany on the night of 18\u201319 April 1945 in which they were attacked by German Marines. The Guards Armoured Division was disbanded at &lt;a href=\"Rotenburg%20an%20der%20W%C3%BCmme\"&gt;Rotenburg an der W\u00fcmme&lt;/a&gt;, Lower Saxony on 9 June 1945.\nPost-war career.\nCazalet started his career as a racehorse trainer in November 1945. He paid &lt;a href=\"guinea%20%28British%20coin%29\"&gt;4,000 guineas&lt;/a&gt; for the five-year-old gelding Fishermans Yarn at &lt;a href=\"Newmarket%2C%20Suffolk\"&gt;Newmarket&lt;/a&gt;. Another of his early horses was The Hood, who was entered for a novice &lt;a href=\"Hurdling%20%28horse%20race%29\"&gt;hurdle race&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Racecourse\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt; in March 1946. In the 1946\u201347 season, he had 40 winners, 32 of them ridden by Mildmay.\nIn 1949, Cazalet and Mildmay stayed at &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Castle\"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt; as guests of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother\"&gt;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;. It was during their stay that they persuaded the Queen to buy a &lt;a href=\"Steeplechase%20%28horse%20racing%29\"&gt;steeplechase&lt;/a&gt;r, which Cazalet would train. An early success was &lt;a href=\"Manicou%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Manicou&lt;/a&gt;, who won the &lt;a href=\"King%20George%20VI%20Chase\"&gt;King George VI Chase&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kempton%20Park%20Racecourse\"&gt;Kempton Park Racecourse&lt;/a&gt; in 1950. Another of the Queen's horses trained by Cazalet was Monaveen, jointly owned with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Princess Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;. Following Mildmay's death in May 1950, Cazalet inherited the horses owned by Mildmay and &lt;a href=\"Pound%20Sterling\"&gt;\u00a310,000&lt;/a&gt;.\nCazalet also trained the Queen Mother's &lt;a href=\"Devon%20Loch\"&gt;Devon Loch&lt;/a&gt;, who fell on the run-in to the finish line at the 1956 &lt;a href=\"Grand%20National\"&gt;Grand National&lt;/a&gt; when clear of &lt;a href=\"E.S.B.%20%28horse%29\"&gt;E.S.B.&lt;/a&gt;, who won. Devon Loch subsequently failed to finish. His jockey was &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Francis\"&gt;Dick Francis&lt;/a&gt;, who had been designated as Cazalet's first jockey in 1953. He trained over 250 winners for the Queen Mother and was champion trainer three times. Cazalet's personal chef for eight years was &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Roux\"&gt;Albert Roux&lt;/a&gt;.\nCazalet trained Antiar, who won the Ovaltine Hurdle at &lt;a href=\"Fontwell%20Park%20Racecourse\"&gt;Fontwell Park Racecourse&lt;/a&gt; on 22 December 1962, the last day of racing before &lt;a href=\"Winter%20of%201962%E2%80%9363%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;The Big Freeze&lt;/a&gt; set in. When racing resumed in March 1963, Cazalet had two winners at &lt;a href=\"Newbury%20Racecourse\"&gt;Newbury&lt;/a&gt; on 8 March and four the next day. In the 1964\u201365 season, Cazalet had a record 82 winners. By 1967, he had had his one thousandth winner. His final runner was Soundless at &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20Racecourse\"&gt;Doncaster&lt;/a&gt; on 24 March 1973.\nDeath.\nCazalet died at Fairlawne on 29 May 1973. He was buried at St. Giles' Church; four of his jockeys carried his coffin. A memorial service was held at the &lt;a href=\"Guards%20Chapel%2C%20Wellington%20Barracks\"&gt;Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; on 15 June. Following his death, &lt;a href=\"Fulke%20Walwyn\"&gt;Fulke Walwyn&lt;/a&gt; was appointed trainer to the Queen Mother.\nFairlawne was inherited by Edward Cazalet. He was unable to continue the racing stable due to his career as a &lt;a href=\"barrister\"&gt;barrister&lt;/a&gt;, and later a High Court judge. In 1979, Fairlawne was sold to racehorse owner &lt;a href=\"Khalid%20ibn%20Abdullah\"&gt;Khalid Abdullah&lt;/a&gt;."
