    "text": "The Kings of the Lombards or reges Langobardorum (singular \"rex Langobardorum\") were the monarchs of the &lt;a href=\"Lombards\"&gt;Lombard people&lt;/a&gt; from the early 6th century until the Lombardic identity became lost in the 9th and 10th centuries. After 568, the Lombard kings sometimes styled themselves &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Kings of Italy&lt;/a&gt; (\"rex totius Italiae\"). After 774, they were not Lombards, but &lt;a href=\"Franks\"&gt;Franks&lt;/a&gt;. From the 12th century, the &lt;a href=\"votive%20crown\"&gt;votive crown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"reliquary\"&gt;reliquary&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Crown%20of%20Lombardy\"&gt;Iron Crown&lt;/a&gt; (\"Corona Ferrea\") retrospectively became a symbol of their rule, though it was never used by Lombard kings.\nThe primary sources for the Lombard kings before the Frankish conquest are the anonymous 7th-century \"&lt;a href=\"Origo%20Gentis%20Langobardorum\"&gt;Origo Gentis Langobardorum&lt;/a&gt;\" and the 8th-century \"&lt;a href=\"Historia%20Langobardorum\"&gt;Historia Langobardorum&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20the%20Deacon\"&gt;Paul the Deacon&lt;/a&gt;. The earliest kings (the pre-Lethings) listed in the \"Origo\" are almost certainly legendary. They purportedly reigned during the &lt;a href=\"Migration%20Period\"&gt;Migration Period&lt;/a&gt;. The first ruler attested independently of Lombard tradition is Tato.\nEarly rulers.\n&lt;a href=\"Lething%20Dynasty\"&gt;Lething Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lethings were an early dynasty from the time of Lethuc. The last ruling descendant of Lethuc was &lt;a href=\"Walthari\"&gt;Walthari&lt;/a&gt;, whose son was in turn displaced by &lt;a href=\"Audoin\"&gt;Audoin&lt;/a&gt; of the family of the Gausi.\nKings in Italy.\n&lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20Dynasty\"&gt;Carolingian Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharlemagne conquered the Lombards in 774 at the invitation of &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Adrian%20I\"&gt;Pope Adrian I&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe title \"rex Langobardorum\", synonymous with \"rex Italiae\", lasted well into the &lt;a href=\"High%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;High Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, but subsequent holders are found at &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Italy\"&gt;King of Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamily tree.\n "
