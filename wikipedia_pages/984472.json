    "title": "ZMA (supplement)",
    "text": "ZMA (&lt;a href=\"zinc\"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monomethionine\"&gt;monomethionine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"aspartate\"&gt;aspartate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magnesium%20aspartate\"&gt;magnesium aspartate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20B6\"&gt;vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt;) is a supplement used primarily by &lt;a href=\"sportsperson\"&gt;athletes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gymnasts\"&gt;gymnasts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"bodybuilders\"&gt;bodybuilders&lt;/a&gt;. It was developed by &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Conte\"&gt;Victor Conte&lt;/a&gt; (founder of &lt;a href=\"BALCO\"&gt;BALCO Laboratories&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Burlingame%2C%20California\"&gt;Burlingame, California&lt;/a&gt;). No high quality scientific study has found it to have any beneficial effects on muscle building or strength, and the &lt;a href=\"International%20Society%20of%20Sports%20Nutrition\"&gt;International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Institute%20of%20Sport\"&gt;Australian Institute of Sport&lt;/a&gt; regard it as having no clear benefits.\nFormula.\nThe original ZMA formula is composed of zinc monomethionine and &lt;a href=\"aspartate\"&gt;aspartate&lt;/a&gt; (30\u00a0mg), magnesium aspartate (450\u00a0mg), and vitamin B6 as &lt;a href=\"pyridoxine\"&gt;pyridoxine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hydrochloride\"&gt;hydrochloride&lt;/a&gt; (10.5\u00a0mg). According to the label directions, ZMA should be taken 30 \u2013 60 minutes prior to bedtime and on an empty stomach to help synchronise &lt;a href=\"Absorption%20%28pharmacokinetics%29\"&gt;absorption&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"sleep\"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the product should not be taken with foods or supplements containing &lt;a href=\"calcium\"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; because calcium blocks the absorption of zinc.\nSince ZMA is not a &lt;a href=\"patented\"&gt;patented&lt;/a&gt; formula, other manufacturers can produce supplements using the original ZMA formula. However, as ZMA is a &lt;a href=\"registered%20trademark\"&gt;registered trademark&lt;/a&gt; of SNAC Nutrition (SNAC Systems Inc.), other manufacturers can only brand a product as ZMA, or use the term in marketing, when they have been licensed to do so by SNAC Nutrition. A number of manufacturers take the original ZMA formula and seek to enhance it with added ingredients. SNAC Nutrition itself has ZMA-5 (ZMA formula with &lt;a href=\"5-Hydroxytryptophan\"&gt;5-Hydroxytryptophan&lt;/a&gt;) marketed as a sleep enhancer and ZMA Nightcap (ZMA-based proprietary blend with 5-hydroxytryptophan) marketed as an &lt;a href=\"anabolic\"&gt;anabolic&lt;/a&gt; mineral support. Like all 5-HTP-containing supplements, vivid dreams and/or nightmares are a recognized possible side effect within a subset of users.\nScientific studies.\nAll three basic components in ZMA formula are important in biological processes, and while studies have shown that most Americans get enough zinc and vitamin B6, more than 50% don't meet the U.S. government's recommendation for &lt;a href=\"magnesium\"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;.\nA 1998 study was undertaken on &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; players during an 8-week spring training program. The control group was told to cease taking any nutritional supplements. Those who took the ZMA tablets claimed greater increases in muscle strength. This study was funded by SNAC Systems Inc, the intellectual property right holder, and one of the study's authors, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Conte\"&gt;Victor Conte&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href=\"ownership%20equity\"&gt;ownership equity&lt;/a&gt; in this company.\nIn 2004, a study funded by a research grant from Cytodyne (another supplement producing company) with 42 resistance trained males showed that ZMA supplementation had no significant effects on total and free testosterone, IGF-1, growth hormone, cortisol, the &lt;a href=\"Testosterone-cortisol%20ratio\"&gt;ratio of cortisol to testosterone&lt;/a&gt;, or muscle and liver enzymes in response to training. No significant effects were observed in changes in strength, upper or lower body muscle endurance, or anaerobic sprint capacity.\nIn another study done in 2006, a team of German scientists conducted a study on the effect of ZMA and testosterone levels in the body. The result showed an increase in zinc secretions in urine making it much darker, but no effect on the level of testosterone in the body."
