Its &lt;a href=\"call%20sign\"&gt;call sign&lt;/a&gt; was the . It was formed 16 June 1938 in &lt;a href=\"Osaka\"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt; as a B-class &lt;a href=\"square%20division\"&gt;square division&lt;/a&gt;. The nucleus for the formation was the &lt;a href=\"4th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29\"&gt;4th division&lt;/a&gt; headquarters. The division was originally subordinated to the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Northern%20China%20Area%20Army\"&gt;Northern China Area Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOriginally the \"104th division\" was sent for the escalating &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Lake%20Khasan\"&gt;Battle of Lake Khasan&lt;/a&gt; on Soviet border, but the battle was finished 11 August 1938. Therefore, the \"104th division\" was attached to &lt;a href=\"Twenty-First%20Army%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;21st Army&lt;/a&gt; on 19 September 1938 and sailed from &lt;a href=\"Dalian\"&gt;Dalian&lt;/a&gt; on 4 October 1938. It arrived in &lt;a href=\"Daya%20Bay\"&gt;Daya Bay&lt;/a&gt; on 12 October 1938. The 137th Infantry Regiment then landed and proceeded inland to isolate &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the large-scale &lt;a href=\"Canton%20Operation\"&gt;Canton Operation&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, the main garrison of the 104th Division was established in &lt;a href=\"Conghua%20District\"&gt;Conghua District&lt;/a&gt;. On 9 February 1940 the &lt;a href=\"Twenty-First%20Army%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;21st Army&lt;/a&gt; was dissolved and the 104th Division was reassigned to the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Southern%20China%20Area%20Army\"&gt;Southern China Area Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 104th Division was reassigned to the &lt;a href=\"Twenty-Third%20Army%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;23rd Army&lt;/a&gt; in January 1941, and simultaneously lost the 170th Infantry Regiment, becoming a &lt;a href=\"triangular%20division\"&gt;triangular division&lt;/a&gt;. The detached regiment was converted into the &lt;a href=\"21st%20Independent%20Mixed%20Brigade%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29\"&gt;21st Independent Mixed Brigade&lt;/a&gt; which was eventually sent to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20invasion%20of%20French%20Indochina%23Aftermath\"&gt;Invasion of Southern French Indochina&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a long garrison service in &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, the 104th Division participated in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Ichi-Go\"&gt;Operation Ichi-Go&lt;/a&gt;, capturing &lt;a href=\"Zhaoqing\"&gt;Zhaoqing&lt;/a&gt; on 16 September 1944, &lt;a href=\"Wuxuan%20County\"&gt;Wuxuan County&lt;/a&gt; on 4 November 1944 and &lt;a href=\"Xiangzhou%20County\"&gt;Xiangzhou County&lt;/a&gt; on 6 November 1944. Also, it captured &lt;a href=\"Huizhou\"&gt;Huizhou&lt;/a&gt; on 15 January 1945 and &lt;a href=\"Haifeng%20County\"&gt;Haifeng County&lt;/a&gt; on 18 January 1945. Until the &lt;a href=\"surrender%20of%20Japan\"&gt;surrender of Japan&lt;/a&gt; on 15 August 1945, the 104th Division built coastal fortifications along the &lt;a href=\"Daya%20Bay\"&gt;Daya Bay&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Haifeng%20County\"&gt;Haifeng County&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Lufeng%2C%20Guangdong\"&gt;Lufeng&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Huizhou\"&gt;Huizhou&lt;/a&gt; line. The 161st Infantry Regiment and 104th Transport Regiment were concentrated at &lt;a href=\"Daya%20Bay\"&gt;Daya Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The 108th Infantry Regiment was at &lt;a href=\"Dongguan\"&gt;Dongguan&lt;/a&gt;. It was moved to the port of &lt;a href=\"Taiping%2C%20Perak\"&gt;Taiping, Perak&lt;/a&gt; by 16 February 1946. The 137th Infantry Regiment was garrisoned at &lt;a href=\"Haifeng%20County\"&gt;Haifeng County&lt;/a&gt;, and was moved to &lt;a href=\"Humen%20Town\"&gt;Humen Town&lt;/a&gt; port on 19 February 1946. The 104th Artillery Regiment was located on the southern outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Huizhou\"&gt;Huizhou&lt;/a&gt;, but was transferred on 18 February 1946 to &lt;a href=\"Dongguan\"&gt;Dongguan&lt;/a&gt;. The 104th Engineer Regiment was in &lt;a href=\"Huizhou\"&gt;Huizhou&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe division departed from &lt;a href=\"Humen%20Town\"&gt;Humen Town&lt;/a&gt; port between 28 March and 2 April 1946, and arrived at &lt;a href=\"Uraga%2C%20Kanagawa\"&gt;Uraga, Kanagawa&lt;/a&gt; between 6 and 19 April 1946. The dissolution of the 104th Division was complete by 23 May 1946."
