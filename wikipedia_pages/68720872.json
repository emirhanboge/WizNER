    "text": "James Rawson Carroll (1830 \u2013 November 30, 1911) was an &lt;a href=\"Irish%20people\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"architect\"&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt; who was involved in many projects throughout Ireland during the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Era\"&gt;Victorian Era&lt;/a&gt;. He was a founding partner of the &lt;a href=\"Carroll%20%26amp%3B%20Batchelor\"&gt;Carroll &amp; Batchelor&lt;/a&gt; architectural firm in 1892, alongside Frederick Batchelor. \nLife.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; in 1830, James was the youngest son of Thomas Carroll, of Leinster Street and Waterloo Road. He had three known siblings, Thomas, Howard and Charles. He was educated in &lt;a href=\"Delgany\"&gt;Delgany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Wicklow\"&gt;County Wicklow&lt;/a&gt; and was admitted to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dublin%20Society\"&gt;Royal Dublin Society&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"National%20College%20of%20Art%20and%20Design\"&gt;School of Drawing in Architecture&lt;/a&gt; in 1846. He was subsequently articled to &lt;a href=\"George%20Fowler%20Jones\"&gt;George Fowler Jones&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and worked as his assistant until 1856. His brother Thomas built the stonework for &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Oliver\"&gt;Castle Oliver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Limerick\"&gt;County Limerick&lt;/a&gt; in 1850, which was designed by Jones. During his time in England Carroll also worked at the office of &lt;a href=\"John%20Raphael%20Rodrigues%20Brandon\"&gt;John Raphael Brandon&lt;/a&gt;. Carroll returned to Ireland in 1857 and set up his own practice at 180 &lt;a href=\"Pearse%20Street\"&gt;Great Brunswick Street&lt;/a&gt;, Dublin.\nAs Ireland recovered from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Famine&lt;/a&gt; in the late 19th century, Carroll was able to gain considerable experience designing country houses, ornate churches and public buildings. He presented designs at the Royal Dublin Society's Exhibition of Fine Arts in 1861 and was later chosen as the lead architect for British Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Palmerston\"&gt;Lord Palmerston&lt;/a&gt;'s estate home at &lt;a href=\"Mullaghmore%20Peninsula\"&gt;Mullaghmore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Sligo\"&gt;County Sligo&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Classiebawn%20Castle\"&gt;Classiebawn Castle&lt;/a&gt; was not completed until 1874, nine years after Palmerston's death. In 1870 he was appointed the architect for the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Kilmore%2C%20Elphin%20and%20Ardagh\"&gt;Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh&lt;/a&gt;. Carroll twice represented Ireland at the General Conference of Architects at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects\"&gt;RIBA&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, in 1876 and 1878.\nIn 1892 Carroll formed a new architectural partnership with his chief assistant Frederick Batchelor, called &lt;a href=\"Carroll%20%26amp%3B%20Batchelor\"&gt;Carroll &amp; Batchelor&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of changing social conditions in rural Ireland, most of the projects undertaken by Carroll &amp; Batchelor were large public works concentrated in &lt;a href=\"County%20Dublin\"&gt;County Dublin&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, the firm designed numerous hospitals throughout the 1890s and early 1900s. Carroll was less interested in these projects as he preferred work that had a more personal character. He retired in 1905.\nHis last registered address was at 56 &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Street%20Lower\"&gt;Lower Mount Street&lt;/a&gt;, Dublin. He died on 30 November 1911. At the time of his death, he left his widow Louisa M. Carroll a sum of \u00a34,075 (equivalent to around \u00a3500,000 in 2020). His obituary in the \"&lt;a href=\"Irish%20Builder\"&gt;Irish Builder&lt;/a&gt;\" described him as:\nWork.\nThe nature of Carroll's work was very heavily influenced by the social conditions of his day. Many of his earlier works were either \"&lt;a href=\"Anglo-Irish%20big%20house\"&gt;Big Houses&lt;/a&gt;\" for the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Irish\"&gt;Anglo-Irish&lt;/a&gt; landed gentry or &lt;a href=\"Anglican\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; churches for the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Church of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, which built dozens of churches in rural Ireland during the latter half of the 1800s in an attempt to expand its influence in traditionally &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; areas.\nCarroll's later career coincided with a period of upheaval and instability in Ireland. External factors such as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression%20of%20British%20Agriculture\"&gt;Great Agricultural Depression&lt;/a&gt; (1873-1896), widespread rural agitation and violence (\"\"the &lt;a href=\"Land%20War\"&gt;Land War&lt;/a&gt;\"\"), the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20National%20Land%20League\"&gt;Irish National Land League&lt;/a&gt;, and the land reform acts of 1885 and 1891 heralded the end of the estates period in Ireland. The Anglo-Irish aristocracy grew increasingly indebted and could no longer fund the construction of grand estate homes or churches in their locale.\nWork on such projects all but dried up by 1890 and Carroll spent the last decade of his career overseeing the design or remodelling of public buildings, especially hospitals."
