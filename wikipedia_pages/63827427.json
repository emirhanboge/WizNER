    "text": "Robert Samatan, nicknamed \"Bob la Science\" (&lt;a href=\"Toulouse\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;, 16 April 1909 - &lt;a href=\"Antibes\"&gt;Antibes&lt;/a&gt;, 4 May 1986) was a French &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; footballer.\nHe debuted for &lt;a href=\"Toulouse%20Olympique%20Employ%C3%A9s%20Club\"&gt;T.O.E.C&lt;/a&gt; (rugby union), 1.78m tall and weighing 76\u00a0kg at his debut, later he played at left wing for &lt;a href=\"SU%20Agen%20Lot-et-Garonne\"&gt;SU Agen&lt;/a&gt; (but also as right wing or number eight).\nA very powerful player, he is the forerunner of the modern wingers' playing style. The first player to be inspired by his lively and alert technique was &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Dauger\"&gt;Jean Dauger&lt;/a&gt;, who played for Bayonne.\nIn March &lt;a href=\"1934%20in%20sports\"&gt;1934&lt;/a&gt;, he was dismissed from &lt;a href=\"SU%20Agen%20Lot-et-Garonne\"&gt;SU Agen&lt;/a&gt;, and was part of the rugby league team of the \"Galia\u2019s Boys\" who made a memorable tour in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; under the management and captainship of its creator &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Galia\"&gt;Jean Galia&lt;/a&gt;. His status as a Pioneer (Galia's Boy) did not qualify him as a French International.\nOpting for rugby league, he integrated the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Roanne%20XIII\"&gt;Roanne XIII&lt;/a&gt; squad where &lt;a href=\"Max%20Rousi%C3%A9\"&gt;Max Rousi\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Dauger\"&gt;Jean Dauger&lt;/a&gt; played alongside him in 1938.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1951%20in%20sports\"&gt;1951&lt;/a&gt;, he led the first French tour of a team sport (e.g. France national rugby league team) in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his civil life, he worked as wholesaler in the alimentar sector.\nBiography.\nIn March 1934, Robert Samatan made an interview for &lt;a href=\"L%27%C3%89quipe\"&gt;L'Auto&lt;/a&gt; after switching to rugby league where he denounced the hypocrisy and the 'shamateurism' within the &lt;a href=\"French%20Rugby%20Federation\"&gt;French Rugby Federation&lt;/a&gt; since several years. Playing then at the Toulouse Lyceum, he received an offer from Annibert (of &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Toulousain\"&gt;Stade Toulousain&lt;/a&gt;, who later became a member of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Athletics%20Federation\"&gt;French Athletics Federation&lt;/a&gt; where he dictated the laws of the full amateurism). Annibert promised him a success at his exams and numerous advantages and Mr. Furst of Stade Toulousain also proposed him 200 francs per month, which convinced Samatan to sign. After some months, his salary quadrupled and numerous clubs offered him a better salary like &lt;a href=\"US%20Quillan\"&gt;Quillan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"US%20Carcassonne\"&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt;, but it is finally Agen through Mr. Armand Bastoul's intermediary which obtained his signature for 25.000 &lt;a href=\"French%20franc\"&gt;francs&lt;/a&gt; and a situation, which later convinced &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Porra\"&gt;Maurice Porra&lt;/a&gt; to join him at Agen for 1.500 francs per month. He decided to take part of the creation of a French rugby league team with &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Galia\"&gt;Jean Galia&lt;/a&gt;. Appointed by the latter to convince some players to switch to rugby league, he faced overbids from rugby union clubs which were yet amateur in principle, such as &lt;a href=\"USA%20Perpignan\"&gt;USA Perpignan&lt;/a&gt;."
