    "text": "USS \"Richmond\" (CL-9) was an &lt;a href=\"light%20cruiser\"&gt;light cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, originally classified as a &lt;a href=\"scout%20cruiser\"&gt;scout cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;. She was the third Navy ship named for the city of &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt;, Virginia.\nBuilt in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\"Richmond\" was originally authorized on 29 August 1916, and awarded to &lt;a href=\"William%20Cramp%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;William Cramp &amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; on 30 July 1917. She was laid down on 16 February 1920, and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20naming%20and%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 29 September 1921, sponsored by Miss Elizabeth S. Scott. \"Richmond\" was &lt;a href=\"ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 2 July 1923, with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-6%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"David%20F.%20Boyd\"&gt;David F. Boyd&lt;/a&gt; in command.\nCharacteristics.\n\"Richmond\" was &lt;a href=\"length%20at%20the%20waterline\"&gt;long at the waterline&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;overall&lt;/a&gt; length of , her &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; was and a mean &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . Her &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement\"&gt;standard displacement&lt;/a&gt; was and at &lt;a href=\"Full-load%20displacement\"&gt;full load&lt;/a&gt;. Her crew, during peace time, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men.\nPower plant.\n\"Richmond\" was powered by four &lt;a href=\"Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company\"&gt;Parsons steam turbines&lt;/a&gt; geared &lt;a href=\"steam%20turbine\"&gt;steam turbine&lt;/a&gt;s, each driving one &lt;a href=\"Propeller\"&gt;screw&lt;/a&gt;, using steam generated by 12 &lt;a href=\"White-Forster%20boiler\"&gt;White-Forster boiler&lt;/a&gt;s. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . She was designed to provide a range of at a speed of , but was only capable of at a speed of \nOriginal armament.\n\"Richmond\"s main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten &lt;a href=\"6-inch/53-caliber%20gun\"&gt;/53&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"caliber%20%28artillery%29\"&gt;caliber&lt;/a&gt; guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered &lt;a href=\"Casemate%23Single%20casemates%20%281889%20onwards%29\"&gt;casemates&lt;/a&gt; on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After America's entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-in/53 caliber guns in two twin &lt;a href=\"Gun%20turret%23Warships\"&gt;gun turrets&lt;/a&gt; fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two &lt;a href=\"3-inch/50-caliber%20gun\"&gt;/50&lt;/a&gt; caliber &lt;a href=\"Anti-aircraft%20warfare\"&gt;anti-aircraft&lt;/a&gt; guns in single mounts. \"Richmond\" was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 &lt;a href=\"naval%20mine\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;, but these were removed early in her career to make way for more crew accommodations. She also carried two triple and two twin, above-water, &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt; mounts for &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper &lt;a href=\"deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt;, aft of the &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20catapult\"&gt;aircraft catapult&lt;/a&gt;s, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull.\nThe ship lacked a full-length &lt;a href=\"waterline\"&gt;waterline&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Belt%20armor\"&gt;armor belt&lt;/a&gt;. The sides of her &lt;a href=\"Engine%20room\"&gt;boiler and engine room&lt;/a&gt;s and steering gear were protected by of armor. The transverse &lt;a href=\"bulkhead%20%28partition%29\"&gt;bulkhead&lt;/a&gt;s at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against &lt;a href=\"muzzle%20blast\"&gt;muzzle blast&lt;/a&gt; and the conning tower had 1.5 inches of armor. \"Richmond\" carried two &lt;a href=\"floatplane\"&gt;floatplane&lt;/a&gt;s aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably &lt;a href=\"Vought%20VE-7\"&gt;Vought VE-9s&lt;/a&gt; until the early 1930s when the ship may have operated &lt;a href=\"Berliner-Joyce%20OJ\"&gt;OJ-2&lt;/a&gt; until 1935 and &lt;a href=\"Curtiss%20SOC%20Seagull\"&gt;Curtiss SOC Seagull&lt;/a&gt;s until 1940 when &lt;a href=\"Vought%20OS2U%20Kingfisher\"&gt;Vought OS2U Kingfisher&lt;/a&gt;s were used on ships without hangars.\nArmament changes.\nDuring her career \"Richmond\" went through several armament changes, some of these changes were save weight, but others were to increase her AA armament. The lower torpedo tube mounts proved to be very wet and were removed, and the openings plated over, before the start of World War II. Another change made before the war was to increase the 3-inch guns to eight, all mounted in the ship's waist. After 1940, the lower aft 6-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts. The ship's anti-aircraft armament were augmented by three twin &lt;a href=\"Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun%23Naval\"&gt;Bofors guns&lt;/a&gt; along with 12 &lt;a href=\"Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon\"&gt;Oerlikon cannons&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the war.\nInter-war period.\nOn completion of a three-month shakedown cruise to &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, \"Richmond\" underwent post-shakedown availability and in December departed Norfolk for &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. There, at the end of 1923, she became flagship of the &lt;a href=\"Scouting%20Force\"&gt;Scouting Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn early January 1924, she got underway to participate in &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Problem%20III\"&gt;Fleet Problem III&lt;/a&gt; which tested &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; defenses and transit facilities of the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal\"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt;. On the 19th, she arrived off &lt;a href=\"Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt;, rescued survivors of , wrecked on &lt;a href=\"Blanquilla%20Reef\"&gt;Blanquilla Reef&lt;/a&gt;; then proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Tampico\"&gt;Tampico&lt;/a&gt; to stand by as political tension rose. On the 26th, she headed for &lt;a href=\"Galveston\"&gt;Galveston&lt;/a&gt;, only to return to &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; on 3 February to evacuate refugees from &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Mexico\"&gt;Puerto Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and transport them to Veracruz. On the 17th, she headed east and joined in exercises off &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May, \"Richmond\" returned briefly to New Orleans, then steamed for the northeast coast and further exercises. Toward the end of July she departed Newport, R.I., for duty as a station ship along the route of &lt;a href=\"First%20aerial%20circumnavigation\"&gt;USAAS's first aerial circumnavigation&lt;/a&gt; of the world. On 2 August, she attempted to take in tow the &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20World%20Cruiser\"&gt;Douglas World Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; \"Boston\", downed on the Atlantic Ocean after engine trouble, but the floatplane capsized in rough seas, although the two crew were rescued. Then, from September through December, she underwent overhaul at the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Navy%20Yard\"&gt;New York Navy Yard&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn January 1925, \"Richmond\", flagship of Light Cruiser Divisions, Scouting Fleet, again participated in Caribbean exercises. In February, she transited the Panama Canal and during March trained off the &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; coast. In April, she steamed to &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; for joint Army-Navy maneuvers, after which she joined the Battle Fleet for a good will cruise to &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturning to Norfolk on 23 November, \"Richmond\" operated off the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean through 1926. On 1 February 1927, she again transited the Panama Canal; conducted exercises in Hawaiian waters; then continued on to &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, arriving at &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; on 3 April. She remained on the China Station for a year, with only infrequent diversions to the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; for repairs and exercises. On 14 April 1928, she sailed eastward and less than three months later departed &lt;a href=\"San%20Pedro%2C%20California\"&gt;San Pedro, California&lt;/a&gt;, for &lt;a href=\"Corinto%20%28Nicaragua%29\"&gt;Corinto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nicaragua\"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt; with a Navy Battalion embarked. On 25 July, she retransited the Panama Canal and for the next six years operated off the &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; and mid-Atlantic coasts and in the Caribbean with occasional interruptions for fleet problems and exercises in the eastern Pacific.\nFrom September 1934 to December 1937, \"Richmond\" operated off the west coast as a unit of the Scouting Fleet. On 12 February 1935, she rescued 64 members of the crew of the downed airship &lt;a href=\"USS%20Macon%20%28ZRS-5%29\"&gt;USS \"Macon\"&lt;/a&gt;. After 21 December 1937, she served as flagship of the Submarine Force, and on 10 May 1938, she headed back to the east coast. On 26 August, she returned to San Diego and resumed her previous duty with the Submarine Force. In the winter of 1939 and the fall of 1940, she returned to the Atlantic for fleet and submarine exercises, and, at the end of December 1940, hauled down the flag of the Submarine Force.\nWith the new year, 1941, \"Richmond\" shifted to Pearl Harbor; and, from January to June, served as flagship, Scouting Force. Into October, she remained in Hawaiian waters, operating with Cruiser Division 3 (CruDiv 3), then she returned to California and in November began Neutrality Patrols off the west coasts of the Americas. On 7 December, she was \"en route\" to &lt;a href=\"Valpara%C3%ADso\"&gt;Valpara\u00edso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld War II.\nRecalled from her original mission, she took up patrol off Panama and in 1942 commenced escorting reinforcement convoys to the &lt;a href=\"Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands\"&gt;Gal\u00e1pagos Islands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Society%20Islands\"&gt;Society Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Later, returning to patrols from Panama to Chile, she put into San Francisco for overhaul in December and in January 1943 sailed for the &lt;a href=\"Aleutians\"&gt;Aleutians&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Richmond\" arrived at &lt;a href=\"Unalaska\"&gt;Unalaska&lt;/a&gt; on 28 January 1943. On 3 February, she became flagship of Task Group 16.6 (TG 16.6), a cruiser-destroyer task group assigned to defend the approaches to recently occupied &lt;a href=\"Amchitka\"&gt;Amchitka&lt;/a&gt;. On the 10th, she underwent her first enemy air raid and on the 18th she participated in the initial bombardment of &lt;a href=\"Holtz%20Bay\"&gt;Holtz Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chichagof%20Harbor\"&gt;Chichagof Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Attu%20Island\"&gt;Attu Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe force then resumed patrols to enforce the blockade of enemy installations on Attu and &lt;a href=\"Kiska\"&gt;Kiska&lt;/a&gt;. In March, the Japanese decided to run the blockade and on the 22nd dispatched a force of two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, four destroyers, and three transports from &lt;a href=\"Paramushiro\"&gt;Paramushiro&lt;/a&gt;. TG 16.6, one light cruiser, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers, intercepted the Japanese on the 26th approximately 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) west of Attu and 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) south of the &lt;a href=\"Komandorski%20Islands\"&gt;Komandorski Islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Japanese sent the transports and one destroyer on, then turned to meet \"Richmond\"s force. At 0840, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Komandorski%20Islands\"&gt;Battle of the Komandorski Islands&lt;/a&gt; began.\nInitially firing on \"Richmond\", the Japanese soon concentrated on , the only American ship with the firing range to reach them. In the running, retiring action which ensued and lasted until shortly after noon, \"Salt Lake City\" went dead in the water, but continued firing. \"Richmond\" went to her aid as the American destroyers closed the Japanese for a torpedo attack. The enemy, however, low on fuel and ammunition did not press their advantage. Changing course, they headed west, pursued by the American destroyers. \"Salt Lake City\" regained power after four minutes and \"Richmond\" joined the destroyers, but the action was broken off as the Japanese outdistanced TG 16.6.\nThe transports sent ahead by the Japanese turned back for the &lt;a href=\"Kuriles\"&gt;Kuriles&lt;/a&gt; before reaching Attu. TG 16.6 had succeeded in its mission. In May, a week-long struggle resulted in the reoccupation of Attu by American forces.\nIn August, Kiska became the target, and \"Richmond\" joined in the preinvasion bombardment. The landings took place on the 15th and met no resistance. The Japanese had pulled out undetected, before the end of July.\nOn 24 August, \"Richmond\" departed the Aleutians; underwent overhaul at &lt;a href=\"Mare%20Island\"&gt;Mare Island&lt;/a&gt;; then returned to Kiska. Through the remainder of the year, she conducted patrols to the west of the outer Aleutians. On 4 February 1944, she began bombardment missions in the Kuriles which continued, alternated with antishipping sweeps, for the remainder of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the end of hostilities, \"Richmond\" covered the occupation of northern Japan. On 14 September 1945, she departed &lt;a href=\"Ominato\"&gt;Ominato&lt;/a&gt; for Pearl Harbor, where she was routed on to Philadelphia for inactivation. Decommissioned on 21 December, \"Richmond\" was struck from the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Vessel%20Register\"&gt;Naval Vessel Register&lt;/a&gt; on 21 January 1946, and was sold on 18 December to the Patapsco Scrap Co., Bethlehem, Pa.\nAwards.\n\"Richmond\" earned two &lt;a href=\"Battle%20star%23Navy%20warships\"&gt;battle star&lt;/a&gt;s for World War II service."
