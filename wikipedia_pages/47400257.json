    "text": "Eir Sport 2 (stylised as eir Sport 2, formerly Setanta Sports 1) was an &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pay%20television\"&gt;pay television&lt;/a&gt; channel owned by Setanta Sports Channel Ireland.\nThe channel carried coverage of &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; (including top-flight European leagues and &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;), boxing, golf, motorsport, and coverage of the SSE Airtricity League.\nOn 16 December 2013 Setanta Sports launched a high-definition of Setanta Sports 1. Setanta Sports 1 HD was first exclusively available through &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Media%20Ireland\"&gt;Virgin Media Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, but later launched on Sky on 20 July 2015, along with Premier Sports HD.\nOn 15 August 2019, Eir Sport and &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Media%20Sport\"&gt;Virgin Media Sport&lt;/a&gt; contracted a deal to show &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Media%20Sport%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;Virgin Media Sport&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Eir%20Vision\"&gt;Eir Vision&lt;/a&gt; and Eir Sport 1 on &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Media%20Ireland\"&gt;Virgin Media Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs per eir's announcement on 19 May 2021, Eir Sport 2 closed on 20 July 2021. Eir also announced that &lt;a href=\"Eir%20Sport%201\"&gt;Eir Sport 1&lt;/a&gt; will also close before the end of 2021.\nBroadcast rights.\nMost of these aired on both &lt;a href=\"Setanta%20Ireland\"&gt;Setanta Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and Setanta Sports 1 and were shared between the two channels. In some instances (largely &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; coverage) Setanta only possessed &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; rights, during such programming the channel is unavailable in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, live coverage of GAA Championship matches was available only in Northern Ireland and not the Republic.\nOther programming.\nSetanta's major in-house programme was \"The Sports Show\" (formerly \"The Hub\") which aired daily. It also simulcasted the radio show Off The Ball from &lt;a href=\"Newstalk\"&gt;Newstalk&lt;/a&gt;.\nSetanta Sports Cup.\nSetanta was the sponsor of the &lt;a href=\"Setanta%20Sports%20Cup\"&gt;Setanta Sports Cup&lt;/a&gt;, an annual soccer tournament which featured teams from the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;League of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"IFA%20Premiership\"&gt;Irish Football League&lt;/a&gt;.\nAvailability.\nAs of July 2016 in the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, the Eir Sport Package was available for free to any Eir broadband customer. This included the &lt;a href=\"BT%20Sport\"&gt;BT Sport&lt;/a&gt; package. Additionally the Eir Sport Package was available on &lt;a href=\"Eir\"&gt;Eir TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Media%20Ireland\"&gt;Virgin Media Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Ireland\"&gt;Sky Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vodafone%20Ireland\"&gt;Vodafone TV&lt;/a&gt;. Eir Sport offered commercial venues in Ireland programming of sports such as &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; (soccer), &lt;a href=\"Gaelic%20football\"&gt;Gaelic football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hurling\"&gt;hurling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 12 September 2019, Eir Sport 2 was removed from Sky in Ireland and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Media%20Sport%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;Virgin Media Sport&lt;/a&gt;. On 13 August 2020, Virgin Media Sport's feeds on &lt;a href=\"Eir%20%28telecommunications%29\"&gt;Eir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Ireland\"&gt;Sky Ireland&lt;/a&gt; that were provided by Eir were replaced by Eir Sport 2 on those platforms, as Eir refused to pay the contracted distribution license fee."
