The school has two buildings on its campus; one is for elementary grades and the other holds the middle and high school classes. The school serves Stillwater and portions of the cities of &lt;a href=\"Saratoga%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Saratoga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Easton%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Easton&lt;/a&gt;.\nStudent life.\nThe school mascot is the Warriors and the colors are maroon and white, although black has been used on some older uniforms. Recently, a new &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; field with lights replaced the old. The field has a turf surface and was built over the old &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; field. The new baseball field was moved to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Legion\"&gt;American Legion&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of the village. Along with that, a new gymnasium has been built to better serve the school.\nSports that are offered by the school include football, boys and girls soccer, golf, girls volleyball, cross country, basketball and football cheerleading, alpine skiing, boys and girls basketball, indoor track, baseball, softball, outdoor track, and a Rowing Club.\nStudents at Stillwater Central School District have access to several extracurriculars and clubs, including nationally recognized programs such as &lt;a href=\"Link%20Crew\"&gt;Link Crew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Key%20Club\"&gt;Key Club&lt;/a&gt;."
