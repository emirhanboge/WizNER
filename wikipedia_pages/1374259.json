    "text": "Alec Raymond \"Ray\" Cashley (born 23 October 1951 in &lt;a href=\"Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, England) is an English former professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe joined &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol City&lt;/a&gt; as a youth player and was their number one goalkeeper in the early 1970s despite starting his career as a fullback. He made his debut for Bristol City against Southampton in the FA Cup in 1970. In the 1975\u201376 season, City were promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; but Cashley lost his place to &lt;a href=\"John%20Shaw%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201954%29\"&gt;John Shaw&lt;/a&gt; soon afterwards and had only brief spells in the side for the remainder of his time with City. Cashley even scored a goal for City on 18 September &lt;a href=\"1973-74%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt;, with a long clearance from his own penalty area against &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt; on a gusty night. In total, he made 262 appearances, 227 of those in the league for The Robins.\nCashley had a loan spell with &lt;a href=\"Hereford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Hereford United&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, making 20 league and 6 additional appearances for The Whites before playing for &lt;a href=\"Clevedon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Clevedon Town&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 1982 he returned to professional football with &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol Rovers&lt;/a&gt;, who he made 53 league appearances for. He then played for &lt;a href=\"Trowbridge%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Trowbridge Town&lt;/a&gt; before again returning to &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20League\"&gt;The Football League&lt;/a&gt; when he joined &lt;a href=\"Chester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Chester City&lt;/a&gt; in October 1985. Cashley made nine appearances as City were promoted from &lt;a href=\"Division%20Four\"&gt;Division Four&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the season.\nAfter Chester, City came calling yet again, offering Cashley a role in the reserves, albeit without a contract. He would be able to step in to play for City if &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Waugh\"&gt;Keith Waugh&lt;/a&gt; was unable and Cashley jumped at the chance for full-time football once again.\nHe subsequently played for non-league sides &lt;a href=\"East%20Worle%20F.C.\"&gt;East Worle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weston-super-Mare%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Weston-super-Mare&lt;/a&gt;."
