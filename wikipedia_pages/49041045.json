He played very well and settled in both on and off the pitch,\" said Nick Oswald, the Caledonia chief executive, who added: \"We are now very relieved and pleased that he is available to play for us.\"\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Caledonia%20Reds\"&gt;Caledonia Reds&lt;/a&gt; was disbanded in 1998, Patterson moved to play for &lt;a href=\"Glasgow%20Warriors\"&gt;Glasgow Warriors&lt;/a&gt; under its newly merged name Glasgow Caledonians.

I believe I'm still good enough to perform at the highest level.\"\nMoving again after one season, for 2000 - 01 season, he hoped for a return to Scotland but instead he was signed by Italian side &lt;a href=\"Petrarca%20Rugby\"&gt;Petrarca Rugby&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatterson was also to play for .\nInternational career.\nHe represented &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; twice; the first cap against South Africa at Murrayfield, the second cap against Tonga in Pretoria, South Africa at the 1995 World Cup.
