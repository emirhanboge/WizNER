    "title": "Fermented fish",
    "text": "Fermented fish is a traditional preservation of fish. Before refrigeration, canning and other modern preservation techniques became available, fermenting was an important preservation method. Fish rapidly spoils, or goes rotten, unless some method is applied to stop the bacteria that produce the spoilage. &lt;a href=\"Fermentation\"&gt;Fermentation&lt;/a&gt; is a method which attacks the ability of &lt;a href=\"microbial\"&gt;microbial&lt;/a&gt;s to spoil fish. It does this by making the fish muscle more acidic; bacteria usually cease multiplying when the &lt;a href=\"pH\"&gt;pH&lt;/a&gt; drops below 4.5.\nA modern approach, &lt;a href=\"biopreservation\"&gt;biopreservation&lt;/a&gt;, adds &lt;a href=\"lactic%20acid%20bacteria\"&gt;lactic acid bacteria&lt;/a&gt; to the fish to be fermented. This produces active antimicrobials such as lactic and acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and &lt;a href=\"peptide\"&gt;peptide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bacteriocin\"&gt;bacteriocin&lt;/a&gt;s. It can also produce the antimicrobial &lt;a href=\"nisin\"&gt;nisin&lt;/a&gt;, a particularly effective preservative.\nFermented fish preparations can be notable for their putrid smell. These days there are many other techniques of preserving fish, but fish is still fermented because some people enjoy the taste.\nRisks.\n&lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; has witnessed a steady increase of cases of &lt;a href=\"botulism\"&gt;botulism&lt;/a&gt; since 1985. It has more cases of foodborne botulism than any other state in the United States of America. This is caused by the traditional &lt;a href=\"Eskimo\"&gt;Eskimo&lt;/a&gt; practice of allowing animal products such as whole fish, fish heads, &lt;a href=\"walrus\"&gt;walrus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sea%20lion\"&gt;sea lion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"whale\"&gt;whale&lt;/a&gt; flippers, &lt;a href=\"beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt; tails, seal oil, birds, etc., to ferment for an extended period of time before being consumed. The risk is exacerbated when a &lt;a href=\"plastic%20container\"&gt;plastic container&lt;/a&gt; is used for this purpose instead of the old-fashioned, traditional method, a grass-lined hole, as the &lt;a href=\"Clostridium%20botulinum\"&gt;botulinum&lt;/a&gt; bacteria thrive in the anaerobic conditions created by the air-tight enclosure in plastic."
