    "text": "Bijan Elahi (; ; 7 July 1945\u00a0\u2013 1 December 2010) was an Iranian modernist poet and translator. He was for most of his life known as a leading figure of a &lt;a href=\"Modernism\"&gt;modernist&lt;/a&gt; poetry movement in Iran called \"The Other Poetry\" ().\nElahi's poems were posthumously published in two volumes: \"Vision\" (2014) and \"Youths\" (2015). \"Youths\" brings together what the poet\u2019s calls his \u201cyoung poems\u201d (\"Javaniha\", 233), many of which had been published in serial form prior to the 1979 revolution. Vision is a collection of four poem cycles that indicate the fullness of Elahi\u2019s contribution to Persian literature.\n&lt;a href=\"Rebecca%20Ruth%20Gould\"&gt;Rebecca Ruth Gould&lt;/a&gt; and Kayvan Tahmasebian have argued that \"A considerable strand of Persian poetry today is directly and indirectly inspired by Elahi's inventions and inspirations.\"\nElahi's poems have appeared in English in \"Poetry Wales\", \"Waxwing\", \"The McNeese Review\", and \"Tin House\".The first book-length translation of his poetry appeared in 2019 under the title \"High Tide of the Eyes: Poems by Bijan Elahi\", translated by Rebecca Ruth Gould and Kayvan Tahmasebian."
