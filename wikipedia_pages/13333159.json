    "text": "Holts Landing State Park is a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Delaware%20state%20parks\"&gt;Delaware state park&lt;/a&gt; northwest of &lt;a href=\"Bethany%20Beach%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;Bethany Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sussex%20County%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;Sussex County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Delaware\"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, USA. Prior to becoming a state park the land of Holts Landing State Park was the Holt &lt;a href=\"family%20farm\"&gt;family farm&lt;/a&gt;. The Holts sold the land to the state of Delaware in 1957 and Holts Landing State Park was opened to the public in 1965. The park is on the southern shore of &lt;a href=\"Indian%20River%20Bay\"&gt;Indian River Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Holts Landing State Park is open for year-round recreation and features the only &lt;a href=\"pier\"&gt;pier&lt;/a&gt; on the east coast of Delaware that has been purpose-built for &lt;a href=\"crabbing\"&gt;crabbing&lt;/a&gt;, the recreational harvesting of &lt;a href=\"Callinectes%20sapidus\"&gt;blue crab&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nHolts Landing State Park, on Indian River Bay, has long been a center of crabbing, fishing, hunting, and farming dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Pre-Columbian\"&gt;Pre-Columbian&lt;/a&gt; history of what is now southeastern Delaware. &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native peoples&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of the abundant &lt;a href=\"seafood\"&gt;seafood&lt;/a&gt; that was harvested in the shallow waters of the inland bays. They also hunted wildlife in the surrounding &lt;a href=\"marsh\"&gt;marsh&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe arrival of colonists from &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; signalled the end of the way of life that the Native Americans had known. They were driven out by war and disease and were displaced by people of European ancestry who began farming the land on the southern coast of Indian River Bay. These colonists continued the practice of harvesting seafood from the bay and expanded their farming operations slowly over the years. The Holt family operated a small family farm and boat landing for many years before selling their property to the state in 1957. Holts Landing State Park was opened for public use in 1965.\nBy 2014, Holts Landing State Park had begun to show signs of neglect. An estimated 6,000 people visited the park that year and, thanks to a &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20Division%20of%20Parks%20and%20Recreation\"&gt;Delaware Division of Parks and Recreation&lt;/a&gt; funding formula that allocated funding for maintenance and improvements based on annual visitor totals, the park had received little funding over the previous 10 to 12 years due to its limited number of annual visitors. A negative cycle had begun in which fewer and fewer visitors came to the park as its facilities deteriorated, resulting in fewer and fewer funds with which to correct deficiencies there. To address the situation, local residents formed a volunteer organization, the Friends of Holts Landing State Park, in October 2014 to sponsor clean-up and maintenance activities at the park and to partner with Delaware Parks and Recreation officials in maintaining the park's grounds and facilities and constructing improvements at the park. Between January and May 2015, the Friends of Holts Landing State Park cleaned up the park's trails, installed new trail signs and markers, worked with the &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20Department%20of%20Natural%20Resources%20and%20Environmental%20Control\"&gt;Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control&lt;/a&gt; to reconfigure trails to avoid anticipated problems with a rise in sea level expected over the next 20 years, and installed new benches and picnic tables. In the summer of 2015, the park celebrated its 50th anniversary and its recent improvements with its first summer music concert series, held as part of a summer series of monthly \"Family Fun Nights\" that began that year.\nIn October 2015, the park's old single-lane &lt;a href=\"boat%20ramp\"&gt;boat ramp&lt;/a&gt; closed. It was removed and replaced with an updated, two-lane concrete ramp leading to a newly &lt;a href=\"Dredging\"&gt;dredged&lt;/a&gt; channel. The new ramp opened in April 2016.\nRecreation.\nHolts Landing State Park has 2,000 feet (610 meters) of shoreline along the south coast of the Indian River Bay. The park's 220-foot (67-meter) crabbing pier on the bay was constructed in 2001 to provide visitors with easy access to the abundant blue crabs of the park; crabbers lower a baited basket into the waters of the bay and wait for the crabs to take the bait before pulling them out of the water. The pier also is open for &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;; the common game fish in the bay are &lt;a href=\"sea%20trout\"&gt;sea trout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flounder\"&gt;flounder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bluefish\"&gt;bluefish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"perch\"&gt;perch&lt;/a&gt;. Visitors may also wade into the shallow waters of the bay to harvest &lt;a href=\"clam\"&gt;clam&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe park's two-lane concrete boat ramp provides the only public boat and &lt;a href=\"kayak\"&gt;kayak&lt;/a&gt; access on the south shore of the Indian River Bay between &lt;a href=\"Millsboro%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;Millsboro&lt;/a&gt; to the west and the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20River%20Inlet\"&gt;Indian River Inlet&lt;/a&gt; to the east; the launching facilities lead to a channel 60 feet (18.3 meters) wide by 4 feet (1.2 meters) deep, and the ramp can accommodate boats up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) in length. The ramp has its own parking area and is popular with &lt;a href=\"fishermen\"&gt;fishermen&lt;/a&gt; and recreational boaters.\nThe park encompasses 204 acres (82.5 hectares) of upland forest, within which are several hidden &lt;a href=\"fresh%20water\"&gt;fresh water&lt;/a&gt; ponds which have evolved naturally from borrow pits left behind by the &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;Delaware Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; after road construction. The park has three 20-acre (8-hectare) wilderness campsites, all located within the forest, and two main trails \u2013 the Sea Hawk Trail and the Seahorse Trail \u2013 and three lesser trails with a combined length of 3.1 miles (5\u00a0km) and open for easy hiking, biking, and equestrian use:\nHolts Landing State Park's &lt;a href=\"picnic\"&gt;picnic&lt;/a&gt; facilities include picnic tables located in shady sections of the park. There are nearby charcoal grills and a large lawn for the spreading of picnic blankets. A &lt;a href=\"pavilion\"&gt;pavilion&lt;/a&gt; with a large grill and a seating capacity of 80 people is available to rent for events such as family reunions, church gatherings, and company picnics. Holts Landing State Park also features a &lt;a href=\"playground\"&gt;playground&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"horseshoes\"&gt;horseshoes&lt;/a&gt; pits. &lt;a href=\"Public%20toilet\"&gt;Public toilet&lt;/a&gt; facilities are located between the main parking area and the crabbing pier.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Assawoman%20Canal\"&gt;Assawoman Canal&lt;/a&gt;, which connects Indian River Bay to the north with &lt;a href=\"Little%20Assawoman%20Bay\"&gt;Little Assawoman Bay&lt;/a&gt; to the south, is part of Holts Landing State Park. Immigrant laborers initially dug the &lt;a href=\"canal\"&gt;canal&lt;/a&gt; by hand in the 1890s. Last &lt;a href=\"dredge\"&gt;dredge&lt;/a&gt;d in the 1950s, the canal is no longer deep enough to handle the boat traffic that once passed through it when it was part of the &lt;a href=\"Intracoastal%20Waterway\"&gt;Intracoastal Waterway&lt;/a&gt;. Although a privately owned &lt;a href=\"marina\"&gt;marina&lt;/a&gt; lies within the park at the northern end of the canal, most of the rest of the canal is too shallow and narrow for recreational motorboats to navigate safely. The canal has become a haven for recreational kayakers.\nThe recreational facilities at Holts Landing State Park are open daily from 8:00\u00a0a.m. &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;Eastern Time&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"sunset\"&gt;sunset&lt;/a&gt; except for the boat ramp, which is open 24 hours a day.\nIn 2015, an annual summer music concert series began at Holts Landing State Park as part of a series of monthly summer \"Family Fun Nights\" at the park, sponsored during their first year by the Delaware Division of Parks and Recreation in honor of the park's 50th anniversary. In 2016, the Friends of Holts Landing State Park volunteer group took over sponsorship of the Family Fun Nights and their associated concert series.\nWildlife.\nHolts Landing State Park is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Commonly seen wading birds include &lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;heron&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"egret\"&gt;egret&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ibis\"&gt;ibis&lt;/a&gt;es. &lt;a href=\"Hawk\"&gt;Hawk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"osprey\"&gt;osprey&lt;/a&gt;s are the most often seen birds of prey at the park. The forests are populated with &lt;a href=\"songbird\"&gt;songbird&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"white-tailed%20deer\"&gt;white-tailed deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"raccoon\"&gt;raccoon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"muskrat\"&gt;muskrat&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"opossum\"&gt;opossum&lt;/a&gt;s. The small &lt;a href=\"pond\"&gt;pond&lt;/a&gt;s that evolved when the abandoned road construction pits filled with fresh water have created habitats for local animals and plants. The Assawoman Canal also provides a habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. Possible development along the canal has drawn the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Club\"&gt;Sierra Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nNearby state parks.\nThe following state parks are within of Holts Landing State Park:"
