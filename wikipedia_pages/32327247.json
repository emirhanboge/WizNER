    "text": "Apple silicon is a series of &lt;a href=\"system%20on%20a%20chip\"&gt;system on a chip&lt;/a&gt; (SoC) and &lt;a href=\"System%20in%20package\"&gt;system in a package&lt;/a&gt; (SiP) processors designed by &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Inc.\"&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, mainly using the &lt;a href=\"ARM%20architecture\"&gt;ARM architecture&lt;/a&gt;. It is the basis of most new &lt;a href=\"Macintosh\"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt; computers as well as &lt;a href=\"iPhone\"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iPad\"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apple%20TV\"&gt;Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Watch\"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and of products such as &lt;a href=\"AirPods\"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"HomePod\"&gt;HomePod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iPod%20Touch\"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"AirTag\"&gt;AirTag&lt;/a&gt;.\nApple announced its plan to &lt;a href=\"Mac%20transition%20to%20Apple%20silicon\"&gt;switch Mac computers from Intel processors&lt;/a&gt; to Apple silicon at &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Worldwide%20Developers%20Conference%232020\"&gt;WWDC 2020&lt;/a&gt; on June 22, 2020. The first Macs built around the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20M1\"&gt;Apple M1&lt;/a&gt; processor were unveiled on November 10, 2020. By early 2022, most Mac models were built on Apple silicon; exceptions include the 27\u2011inch &lt;a href=\"iMac\"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mac%20Pro\"&gt;Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt;.\nApple outsources the chips' manufacture but fully controls their integration with the company's hardware and software. &lt;a href=\"Johny%20Srouji\"&gt;Johny Srouji&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of Apple's silicon design.\nEarly series.\nApple first used SoCs in early versions of the &lt;a href=\"iPhone\"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iPod%20touch\"&gt;iPod touch&lt;/a&gt;. They combine in one package a single &lt;a href=\"ARM%20architecture\"&gt;ARM-based&lt;/a&gt; processing core (&lt;a href=\"CPU\"&gt;CPU&lt;/a&gt;), a graphics processing unit (&lt;a href=\"GPU\"&gt;GPU&lt;/a&gt;), and other electronics necessary for mobile computing.\nThe APL0098 (also 8900B or S5L8900) is a &lt;a href=\"package%20on%20package\"&gt;package on package&lt;/a&gt; (PoP) system on a chip (SoC) that was introduced on June 29, 2007, at the launch of the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%20%281st%20generation%29\"&gt;original iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a 412\u00a0MHz single-core &lt;a href=\"ARM11\"&gt;ARM11&lt;/a&gt; CPU and a PowerVR MBX Lite GPU. It was manufactured by Samsung on a &lt;a href=\"90%20nm\"&gt;90 nm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"semiconductor%20device%20fabrication\"&gt;process&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"iPhone%203G\"&gt;iPhone 3G&lt;/a&gt; and the first-generation iPod touch also use it.\nThe APL0278 (also S5L8720) is a PoP SoC introduced on September 9, 2008, at the launch of the &lt;a href=\"iPod%20touch%20%282nd%20generation%29\"&gt;second-generation iPod touch&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a 533\u00a0MHz single-core ARM11 CPU and a &lt;a href=\"PowerVR\"&gt;PowerVR&lt;/a&gt; MBX Lite GPU. It was manufactured by Samsung on a &lt;a href=\"65%20nm\"&gt;65 nm&lt;/a&gt; process.\nThe APL0298 (also S5L8920) is a PoP SoC introduced on June 8, 2009, at the launch of the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%203GS\"&gt;iPhone 3GS&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a 600\u00a0MHz single-core &lt;a href=\"ARM%20Cortex-A8\"&gt;Cortex-A8&lt;/a&gt; CPU and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. It was manufactured by Samsung on a 65\u00a0nm process.\nThe APL2298 (also S5L8922) is a &lt;a href=\"45%20nm\"&gt;45 nm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"die%20shrink\"&gt;die shrunk&lt;/a&gt; version of the iPhone 3GS SoC and was introduced on September 9, 2009, at the launch of the &lt;a href=\"iPod%20touch%20%283rd%20generation%29\"&gt;third-generation iPod touch&lt;/a&gt;.\nA series.\n is a family of &lt;a href=\"system%20on%20a%20chip\"&gt;SoCs&lt;/a&gt; used in certain models of the &lt;a href=\"iPhone\"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iPad\"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt; other than the &lt;a href=\"iPad%20Pro%20%285th%20generation%29\"&gt;fifth generation iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iPod%20Touch\"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20TV\"&gt;Apple TV&lt;/a&gt; digital media player. They integrate one or more &lt;a href=\"ARM%20architecture\"&gt;ARM-based&lt;/a&gt; processing cores (&lt;a href=\"CPU\"&gt;CPU&lt;/a&gt;), a graphics processing unit (&lt;a href=\"GPU\"&gt;GPU&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"CPU%20cache\"&gt;cache memory&lt;/a&gt; and other electronics necessary to provide mobile computing functions within a single physical package.\nApple A4.\nThe Apple A4 is a PoP SoC manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Samsung\"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, the first SoC Apple designed in-house. It combines an &lt;a href=\"ARM%20architecture\"&gt;ARM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ARM%20Cortex-A8\"&gt;Cortex-A8&lt;/a&gt; CPU also used in Samsung's S5PC110A01 SoC and a &lt;a href=\"PowerVR%23Series5%20%28SGX%29\"&gt;PowerVR SGX 535&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"graphics%20processing%20unit\"&gt;graphics processor&lt;/a&gt; (GPU), all built on Samsung's 45-nanometer silicon chip fabrication process. The design emphasizes power efficiency. The A4 commercially debuted in 2010, in Apple's iPad &lt;a href=\"tablet%20computer\"&gt;tablet&lt;/a&gt;, and was later used in the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%204\"&gt;iPhone 4&lt;/a&gt; smartphone, the &lt;a href=\"iPod%20Touch%20%284th%20generation%29\"&gt;fourth-generation iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;, and the 2nd-generation &lt;a href=\"Apple%20TV\"&gt;Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cortex-A8 core used in the A4, dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"Samsung%20Hummingbird\"&gt;Hummingbird&lt;/a&gt;\", is thought to use performance improvements developed by Samsung in collaboration with chip designer &lt;a href=\"Intrinsity\"&gt;Intrinsity&lt;/a&gt;, which was subsequently acquired by Apple It can run at far higher clock rates than other Cortex-A8 designs yet remains fully compatible with the design provided by ARM. The A4 runs at different speeds in different products: 1\u00a0GHz in the first iPads, 800\u00a0MHz in the iPhone 4 and fourth-generation iPod touch, and an undisclosed speed in the 2nd-generation Apple TV.\nThe A4's SGX535 GPU could theoretically push 35 million polygons per second and 500\u00a0million pixels per second, although real-world performance may be considerably less. Other performance improvements include additional &lt;a href=\"CPU%20cache\"&gt;L2 cache&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe A4 processor package does not contain &lt;a href=\"random-access%20memory\"&gt;RAM&lt;/a&gt;, but supports &lt;a href=\"package%20on%20package\"&gt;PoP&lt;/a&gt; installation. The 1st-generation iPad, &lt;a href=\"iPod%20Touch%204th%20Generation\"&gt;fourth-generation iPod touch&lt;/a&gt;, and the 2nd-generation Apple TV have an A4 mounted with two low-power 128\u00a0MB &lt;a href=\"DDR%20SDRAM\"&gt;DDR SDRAM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Integrated%20circuit\"&gt;chips&lt;/a&gt; (totaling 256\u00a0MB), while the iPhone 4 has two 256\u00a0MB packages for a total of 512\u00a0MB. The RAM is connected to the processor using ARM's &lt;a href=\"64-bit%20computing\"&gt;64-bit&lt;/a&gt;-wide &lt;a href=\"ABMA%203%20AXI\"&gt;AMBA 3 AXI&lt;/a&gt; bus. To give the iPad high graphics bandwidth, the width of the RAM data bus is double that used in previous ARM11- and ARM9-based Apple devices.\nApple A5.\nThe Apple A5 is an SoC manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Samsung\"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; that replaced the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20A4\"&gt;A4&lt;/a&gt;. The chip commercially debuted with the release of Apple's &lt;a href=\"iPad%202\"&gt;iPad 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tablet%20computer\"&gt;tablet&lt;/a&gt; in March 2011, followed by its release in the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%204S\"&gt;iPhone 4S&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"smartphone\"&gt;smartphone&lt;/a&gt; later that year. Compared to the A4, the A5 &lt;a href=\"CPU\"&gt;CPU&lt;/a&gt; \"can do twice the work\" and the &lt;a href=\"Graphics%20processing%20unit\"&gt;GPU&lt;/a&gt; has \"up to nine times the graphics performance\", according to Apple.\nThe A5 contains a dual-core &lt;a href=\"ARM%20Cortex-A9%20MPCore\"&gt;ARM Cortex-A9&lt;/a&gt; CPU with ARM's advanced &lt;a href=\"SIMD\"&gt;SIMD&lt;/a&gt; extension, marketed as &lt;a href=\"ARM%20NEON\"&gt;NEON&lt;/a&gt;, and a dual core &lt;a href=\"PowerVR\"&gt;PowerVR&lt;/a&gt; SGX543MP2 GPU. This GPU can push between 70 and 80 million polygons/second and has a pixel fill rate of 2\u00a0billion pixels/second. The iPad 2's technical specifications page says the A5 is clocked at 1\u00a0GHz, though it can adjust its frequency to save battery life. The clock speed of the unit used in the iPhone 4S is 800\u00a0MHz. Like the A4, the A5 process size is 45\u00a0nm.\nAn updated &lt;a href=\"32%20nm\"&gt;32 nm&lt;/a&gt; version of the A5 processor was used in the 3rd-generation Apple TV, the &lt;a href=\"iPod%20Touch%20%285th%20generation%29\"&gt;fifth-generation iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;, the iPad Mini, and the new version of iPad 2 (version iPad2,4). The chip in the Apple TV has one core locked. Markings on the square package indicate that it is named \"APL2498\", and in software, the chip is called \"S5L8942\". The &lt;a href=\"32%20nanometer\"&gt;32\u00a0nm&lt;/a&gt; variant of the A5 provides around 15% better battery life during web browsing, 30% better when playing 3D games and about 20% better battery life during video playback.\nIn March 2013, Apple released an updated version of the 3rd-generation Apple TV (Rev A, model A1469) containing a smaller, single-core version of the A5 processor. Unlike the other A5 variants, this version of the A5 is not a PoP, having no stacked RAM. The chip is very small, just 6.1\u00d76.2\u00a0mm, but as the decrease in size is not due to a decrease in feature size (it is still on a 32\u00a0nm fabrication process), this indicates that this A5 revision is of a new design. Markings tell that it is named \"APL7498\", and in software, the chip is called \"S5L8947\".\nApple A5X.\nThe Apple A5X is an SoC announced on March 7, 2012, at the launch of the &lt;a href=\"iPad%20%283rd%20generation%29\"&gt;third-generation iPad&lt;/a&gt;. It is a high-performance variant of the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20A5\"&gt;Apple A5&lt;/a&gt;; Apple claims it has twice the graphics performance of the A5. It was superseded in the &lt;a href=\"iPad%20%284th%20generation%29\"&gt;fourth-generation iPad&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20A6X\"&gt;Apple A6X&lt;/a&gt; processor.\nThe A5X has a quad-core graphics unit (PowerVR SGX543MP4) instead of the previous dual-core as well as a quad-channel memory controller that provides a memory bandwidth of 12.8\u00a0GB/s, roughly three times more than in the A5. The added graphics cores and extra memory channels add up to a very large die size of 165\u00a0mm\u00b2, for example twice the size of &lt;a href=\"Nvidia\"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tegra%203\"&gt;Tegra 3&lt;/a&gt;. This is mainly due to the large PowerVR SGX543MP4 GPU. The clock frequency of the dual ARM Cortex-A9 cores have been shown to operate at the same 1\u00a0GHz frequency as in A5. The RAM in A5X is separate from the main CPU package.\nApple A6.\nThe Apple A6 is a PoP SoC introduced on September 12, 2012, at the launch of the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%205\"&gt;iPhone 5&lt;/a&gt;, then a year later was inherited by its minor successor the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%205C\"&gt;iPhone 5C&lt;/a&gt;. Apple states that it is up to twice as fast and has up to twice the graphics power compared to its predecessor the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20A5\"&gt;Apple A5&lt;/a&gt;. It is 22% smaller and draws less power than the 45\u00a0nm A5.\nThe A6 is said to use a 1.3\u00a0GHz custom Apple-designed &lt;a href=\"ARM%20architecture\"&gt;ARMv7&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href=\"Multi-core%20processor\"&gt;dual-core CPU&lt;/a&gt;, called Swift, rather than a licensed CPU from ARM like in previous designs, and an integrated 266\u00a0MHz triple-core &lt;a href=\"PowerVR\"&gt;PowerVR&lt;/a&gt; SGX 543MP3 &lt;a href=\"graphics%20processing%20unit\"&gt;graphics processing unit&lt;/a&gt; (GPU). The Swift core in the A6 uses a new tweaked instruction set, ARMv7s, featuring some elements of the &lt;a href=\"ARM%20Cortex-A15%20MPCore\"&gt;ARM Cortex-A15&lt;/a&gt; such as support for the &lt;a href=\"ARM%20architecture\"&gt;Advanced SIMD v2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"VFP%20%28instruction%20set%29\"&gt;VFPv4&lt;/a&gt;. The A6 is manufactured by Samsung on a &lt;a href=\"high-%CE%BA%20dielectric\"&gt;high-\u03ba&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"metal%20gate\"&gt;metal gate&lt;/a&gt; (HKMG) 32\u00a0nm process.\nApple A6X.\nApple A6X is an SoC introduced at the launch of the &lt;a href=\"iPad%20%284th%20generation%29\"&gt;fourth-generation iPad&lt;/a&gt; on October 23, 2012. It is a high-performance variant of the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20A6\"&gt;Apple A6&lt;/a&gt;. Apple claims the A6X has twice the CPU performance and up to twice the graphics performance of its predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20A5X\"&gt;Apple A5X&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the A6, this SoC continues to use the dual-core Swift CPU, but it has a new quad core GPU, quad channel memory and slightly higher 1.4\u00a0GHz CPU clock rate. It uses an integrated quad-core &lt;a href=\"PowerVR\"&gt;PowerVR&lt;/a&gt; SGX 554MP4 &lt;a href=\"graphics%20processing%20unit\"&gt;graphics processing unit&lt;/a&gt; (GPU) running at 300\u00a0MHz and a quad-channel &lt;a href=\"Memory%20controller\"&gt;memory subsystem&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the A6 the A6X is 30% larger, but it continues to be manufactured by Samsung on a &lt;a href=\"high-%CE%BA%20dielectric\"&gt;high-\u03ba&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"metal%20gate\"&gt;metal gate&lt;/a&gt; (HKMG) 32\u00a0nm process.\nApple A7.\nThe Apple A7 is a &lt;a href=\"64-bit%20computing\"&gt;64-bit&lt;/a&gt; PoP SoC whose first appearance was in the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%205S\"&gt;iPhone 5S&lt;/a&gt;, which was introduced on September 10, 2013. The chip would also be used in the &lt;a href=\"iPad%20Air\"&gt;iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iPad%20Mini%202\"&gt;iPad Mini 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iPad%20Mini%203\"&gt;iPad Mini 3&lt;/a&gt;. Apple states that it is up to twice as fast and has up to twice the graphics power compared to its predecessor the Apple A6. The Apple A7 chip is the first 64-bit chip to be used in a smartphone.\nThe A7 features an Apple-designed 1.3\u20131.4\u00a0GHz 64-bit &lt;a href=\"ARMv8\"&gt;ARMv8&lt;/a&gt;-A dual-core CPU, called Cyclone, and an integrated &lt;a href=\"PowerVR%23Series%206%20%28Rogue%29\"&gt;PowerVR G6430&lt;/a&gt; GPU in a four cluster configuration. The ARMv8-A architecture doubles the number of &lt;a href=\"Processor%20register\"&gt;registers&lt;/a&gt; of the A7 compared to the A6. It now has 31 general-purpose registers that are each &lt;a href=\"64-bit%20computing\"&gt;64-bits&lt;/a&gt; wide and 32 floating-point/&lt;a href=\"ARM%20NEON\"&gt;NEON&lt;/a&gt; registers that are each 128-bits wide. The A7 is manufactured by Samsung on a &lt;a href=\"high-%CE%BA%20dielectric\"&gt;high-\u03ba&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"metal%20gate\"&gt;metal gate&lt;/a&gt; (HKMG) &lt;a href=\"28%20nanometer\"&gt;28 nm&lt;/a&gt; process and the chip includes over 1\u00a0billion &lt;a href=\"Transistor%20count\"&gt;transistors&lt;/a&gt; on a die 102\u00a0mm2 in size.\nApple A8.\nThe Apple A8 is a &lt;a href=\"64-bit%20computing\"&gt;64-bit&lt;/a&gt; PoP SoC manufactured by TSMC. Its first appearance was in the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%206\"&gt;iPhone 6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iPhone%206%20Plus\"&gt;iPhone 6 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which were introduced on September 9, 2014. A year later it would drive the &lt;a href=\"iPad%20Mini%204\"&gt;iPad Mini 4&lt;/a&gt;. Apple states that it has 25% more CPU performance and 50% more graphics performance while drawing only 50% of the power compared to its predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20A7\"&gt;Apple A7&lt;/a&gt;. On February 9, 2018, Apple released the HomePod, which is powered by an Apple A8 with 1 GB of RAM.\nThe A8 features an Apple-designed 1.4\u00a0GHz 64-bit &lt;a href=\"ARMv8\"&gt;ARMv8&lt;/a&gt;-A dual-core CPU, and an integrated custom &lt;a href=\"PowerVR%23Series%206XT\"&gt;PowerVR GX6450&lt;/a&gt; GPU in a four cluster configuration. The GPU features custom shader cores and compiler. The A8 is manufactured on a 20\u00a0nm process by &lt;a href=\"TSMC\"&gt;TSMC&lt;/a&gt;, which replaced &lt;a href=\"Samsung\"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; as the manufacturer of Apple's mobile device processors. It contains 2\u00a0billion transistors. Despite that being double the number of transistors compared to the A7, its physical size has been reduced by 13% to 89\u00a0mm2 (consistent with a shrink only, not known to be a new microarchitecture).\nApple A8X.\nThe Apple A8X is a &lt;a href=\"64-bit%20computing\"&gt;64-bit&lt;/a&gt; SoC introduced at the launch of the &lt;a href=\"iPad%20Air%202\"&gt;iPad Air 2&lt;/a&gt; on October 16, 2014. It is a high performance variant of the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20A8\"&gt;Apple A8&lt;/a&gt;. Apple states that it has 40% more CPU performance and 2.5 times the graphics performance of its predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20A7\"&gt;Apple A7&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike the A8, this SoC uses a &lt;a href=\"triple-core\"&gt;triple-core&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Central%20processing%20unit\"&gt;CPU&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=\"octa-core\"&gt;octa-core&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Graphics%20processing%20unit\"&gt;GPU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dual%20channel%20memory%20architecture\"&gt;dual channel memory&lt;/a&gt; and slightly higher 1.5\u00a0GHz CPU clock rate. It uses an integrated custom octa-core &lt;a href=\"PowerVR\"&gt;PowerVR&lt;/a&gt; GXA6850 &lt;a href=\"graphics%20processing%20unit\"&gt;graphics processing unit&lt;/a&gt; (GPU) running at 450\u00a0MHz and a dual-channel &lt;a href=\"Memory%20controller\"&gt;memory subsystem&lt;/a&gt;. It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"TSMC\"&gt;TSMC&lt;/a&gt; on their 20\u00a0nm fabrication process, and consists of 3\u00a0billion &lt;a href=\"Transistor%20count\"&gt;transistors&lt;/a&gt;.\nApple A9.\nThe Apple A9 is a &lt;a href=\"64-bit%20computing\"&gt;64-bit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ARMv8-A\"&gt;ARM-based&lt;/a&gt; SoC that first appeared in the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%206S\"&gt;iPhone 6S&lt;/a&gt; and 6S Plus, which were introduced on September 9, 2015. Apple states that it has 70% more CPU performance and 90% more graphics performance compared to its predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20A8\"&gt;Apple A8&lt;/a&gt;. It is dual sourced, a first for an Apple SoC; it is manufactured by Samsung on their 14\u00a0nm FinFET LPE process and by TSMC on their 16\u00a0nm FinFET process. It was subsequently included in the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%20SE%20%281st%20generation%29\"&gt;first-generation iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"iPad%20%285th%20generation%29\"&gt;iPad (5th generation)&lt;/a&gt;. The Apple A9 was the last CPU that Apple manufactured through a contract with Samsung, as all A-series chips after are manufactured by TSMC.\nApple A9X.\nThe Apple A9X is a &lt;a href=\"64-bit%20computing\"&gt;64-bit&lt;/a&gt; SoC that was announced on September 9, 2015, and released on November 11, 2015, and first appeared in the &lt;a href=\"iPad%20Pro\"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It offers 80% more CPU performance and two times the GPU performance of its predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20A8X\"&gt;Apple A8X&lt;/a&gt;. It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"TSMC\"&gt;TSMC&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"16%20nm\"&gt;16 nm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"FinFET\"&gt;FinFET&lt;/a&gt; process.\nApple A10 Fusion.\nThe Apple A10 Fusion is a &lt;a href=\"64-bit%20computing\"&gt;64-bit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ARMv8-A\"&gt;ARM-based&lt;/a&gt; SoC that first appeared in the &lt;a href=\"iPhone%207\"&gt;iPhone 7&lt;/a&gt; and 7 Plus, which were introduced on September 7, 2016. The A10 is also featured in the &lt;a href=\"IPad%20%286th%20generation%29\"&gt;sixth-generation iPad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"IPad%20%287th%20generation%29\"&gt;seventh-generation iPad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iPod%20Touch%20%287th%20generation%29\"&gt;seventh-generation iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;. It has a new &lt;a href=\"ARM%20big.LITTLE\"&gt;ARM big.LITTLE&lt;/a&gt; quad core design with two high performance cores, and two smaller highly efficient cores. It is 40% faster than the A9, with 50% faster graphics. It is manufactured by TSMC on their 16\u00a0nm FinFET process.\nApple A10X Fusion.\nThe Apple A10X Fusion is a &lt;a href=\"64-bit%20computing\"&gt;64-bit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ARMv8-A\"&gt;ARM-based&lt;/a&gt; SoC that first appeared in the 10.5\" &lt;a href=\"iPad%20Pro\"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the second generation of the 12.9\" iPad Pro, which were both announced on June 5, 2017.
