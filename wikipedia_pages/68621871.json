When relations between him and Ferrari Orsi became very tense, he was relieved of command on February 28, 1942, replaced by General &lt;a href=\"Giorgio%20Calvi%20di%20Bergolo\"&gt;Giorgio Calvi di Bergolo&lt;/a&gt; and assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20War\"&gt;Ministry of War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the meantime Pizzolato had been promoted to &lt;a href=\"major%20general\"&gt;major general&lt;/a&gt; in January 1942, and from 15 May he was appointed commander of the new &lt;a href=\"80th%20Infantry%20Division%20La%20Spezia\"&gt;80th Infantry Division La Spezia&lt;/a&gt;, an airborne unit, initially intended for use in the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Herkules\"&gt;planned assault on Malta&lt;/a&gt;, but then sent to &lt;a href=\"Libya\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; in October 1942.
