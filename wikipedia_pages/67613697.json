    "text": "The 1997 Atlanta mayoral election occurred on November 4, 1997, with a &lt;a href=\"runoff%20election\"&gt;runoff election&lt;/a&gt; held on November 25, 1997.\nSince no candidate received a &lt;a href=\"majority\"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; in the general election, a &lt;a href=\"runoff%20election\"&gt;runoff election&lt;/a&gt; was held between the top-two finishers. Incumbent mayor &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Campbell%20%28mayor%29\"&gt;Bill Campbell&lt;/a&gt; won reelection in the runoff.\nCampaign.\nAhead of the November 4 election, incumbent Campbell and challenger Arrington exchanged attacks, including personal attacks. Personal attacks between the candidates increased in the runoff. The race was regarded as one of the nastiest mayoral campaigns the city had seen in more than two decades.\nThe discourse of the runoff campaign, which was between two &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; candidates, took on &lt;a href=\"racial\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; tones. Former mayor &lt;a href=\"Maynard%20Jackson\"&gt;Maynard Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, a supporter of Campbell, likened &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;White&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;, who largely supported Arrington in the election, to \"&lt;a href=\"Lester%20Maddox\"&gt;Lester Maddox&lt;/a&gt; types\", and argued that, if Arrington were elected, it would reverse &lt;a href=\"civil%20rights\"&gt;civil rights&lt;/a&gt; progress that the city had made. Arrington denounced such remarks as &lt;a href=\"race%20baiting\"&gt;race baiting&lt;/a&gt;. Days later, Arrington attacked Jackson, accusing him of not participating in the &lt;a href=\"civil%20rights%20movement\"&gt;civil rights movement&lt;/a&gt;, and argued that he had instead been \"in &lt;a href=\"Cleveland\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, passing\", which was widely interpreted as meaning that the &lt;a href=\"light%20skin\"&gt;light skin&lt;/a&gt;ned Jackson was \"&lt;a href=\"Passing%20%28sociology%29\"&gt;passing&lt;/a&gt;\" as White. Many saw Arrington's remarks as having brought to the surface the political dynamics related to Campbell being a light-skinned black candidate and Arrington being a &lt;a href=\"dark%20skin\"&gt;dark skin&lt;/a&gt;ned black candidate. After Arrington's remarks sparked outrage, Arrington argued that he had instead meant to say that, during the early days of the civil rights movement, Jackson, \"was in Cleveland, passing out &lt;a href=\"dictionaries\"&gt;dictionaries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"encyclopedia\"&gt;encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;s.\" In response to Arrington's remarks, Jackson called Arrington, \"an old burned-out, do-nothing, lackluster politician with serious insecurities and hidden angers.\"\nCampbell distributed materials by mail which argued that the, mayor's race \"is now a civil rights issue\", warning that, \"if the ultra&lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservatives&lt;/a&gt; control City Hall we will lose the gains achieved during the last 25 years.\" Arrington criticized these mailers, arguing that they were &lt;a href=\"Loaded%20language\"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; for saying that \"White north Atlanta\" would control City Hall if Arrington were elected.\nBoth candidates sought to win the black vote, seen as critical to either candidate's paths to victory in a city where black people comprised two-thirds of the populace.\nCampbell's campaign spent roughly $3 million, which was roughly twice what Arrington's campaign spent.\nOther campaign issues included &lt;a href=\"crime\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; and the safety of the city's &lt;a href=\"water%20system\"&gt;water system&lt;/a&gt;.\nTurnout for the runoff was considered low."
