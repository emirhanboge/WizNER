    "text": "The Thai Human Imagery Museum () is a &lt;a href=\"wax%20museum\"&gt;wax museum&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Nakhon%20Pathom%20Province\"&gt;Nakhon Pathom Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the tropical climate of Thailand the figures are made of &lt;a href=\"fibreglass\"&gt;fibreglass&lt;/a&gt; instead of the traditional wax. The museum practices dual pricing, with people who do not look Thai paying a 10 times higher entry fee.\nHistory.\nThe museum was opened on 14 June 1989. Thai Human Imagery Museum created by inspired Artist &lt;a href=\"Duangkaew%20Phityakornsilp\"&gt;Duangkaew Phityakornsilp&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues with an aim to promote and to preserve traditional Thai arts and culture. These artists spent over 10 years studying and experimenting on wax sculpture using fibre glass before succeeding in creating beautiful, exquisite, and durable ones.\nExhibitions.\nExhibits include Thai historical figures, including kings of the &lt;a href=\"Chakri%20Dynasty\"&gt;Chakri Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, displays of Thai culture and traditions, and famous fictional characters, including those from &lt;a href=\"Sunthorn%20Phu\"&gt;Sunthorn Phu&lt;/a&gt;'s epic poem, &lt;a href=\"Phra%20Aphai%20Mani\"&gt;Phra Aphai Mani&lt;/a&gt;."
