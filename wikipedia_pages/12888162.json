    "text": "Campus Bay is a baylet of the &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20Inner%20Harbor\"&gt;Richmond Inner Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20California\"&gt;Richmond, California&lt;/a&gt; formed by conflicting drainage on opposite ends from &lt;a href=\"Meeker%20Slough%20%28Creek%29\"&gt;Meeker Slough Creek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baxter%20Creek\"&gt;Baxter Creek&lt;/a&gt;'s deltas &lt;a href=\"Meeker%20Slough\"&gt;Meeker Slough&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stege%20Marsh\"&gt;Stege Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. The area is formed of intertidal mud flats which are generally submerged except for the lowest of tides. The baylet borders the Campus Bay neighborhood and is a highly environmentally sensitive area due to being one of the few remaining wetlands areas in the San Francisco Bay and from pollution from a former UC Berkeley Field Station."
