The memorable fight scenes were choreographed by &lt;a href=\"Yuen%20Woo-ping\"&gt;Yuen Woo-ping&lt;/a&gt;, better known for choreographing &lt;a href=\"Crouching%20Tiger%2C%20Hidden%20Dragon\"&gt;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Matrix\"&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;.\nSynopsis.\nA roving band of &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20people\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"karate\"&gt;karate&lt;/a&gt; fighters led by a masked, long-haired warrior (Kuan Tai Chen) enter a remote village in &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; hoping to get their hands on the local supply of \"Dragon Herb.\" There they come into conflict with a group of &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kung%20fu%20%28term%29\"&gt;kung fu&lt;/a&gt; fighters seeking to defend the herb. Tensions escalate, and the Chinese are defeated in several fights with the clearly superior Japanese force. Luckily, help arrives in the form of an outlaw kung fu expert (Chen Sing), who faces off against the Japanese leader in a climactic fight on the beach.\nBackground.\nAuthors of \"The Encyclopedia of Martial Arts Movies\" said \"The Bloody Fists\" was &lt;a href=\"See-Yuen%20Ng\"&gt;See-Yuen Ng&lt;/a&gt;'s \"first directorial effort\". They said, \"Though the martial arts are rather primitive, its success as a low-budget independent production encouraged other directors to follow suit.\" Bey Logan, writing in \"Hong Kong Action Cinema\", said \"The Bloody Fists\" was \"widely distributed\" and the director's \"first hit\". Richard Meyers, writing in \"Films of Fury: The Kung Fu Movie Book\", said the film was an \"independently produced milestone\" for the director.\n&lt;a href=\"Kuan%20Tai%20Chen\"&gt;Kuan Tai Chen&lt;/a&gt; was a contract actor cast in the film by &lt;a href=\"Shaw%20Brothers%20Studio\"&gt;Shaw Brothers Studio&lt;/a&gt;, but the studio recalled him, resulting in numerous appearances of his character being played by another actor wearing a black mask to conceal his identity.\nReception.\nA film critic for \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time Out&lt;/a&gt;\" called \"The Bloody Fists\" \"a lively example\" of an independent production \"with a good portrait of collective villainy\". The critic commended the \"stylish visuals and the care taken to provide adequate motivation for the usual conflict of interests between the Chinese and the Japanese\"."
