    "text": "The San Remo conference was an international meeting of the post-&lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Allied%20Supreme%20Council\"&gt;Allied Supreme Council&lt;/a&gt; as an outgrowth of the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919\"&gt;Paris Peace Conference&lt;/a&gt;, held at Villa Devachan in &lt;a href=\"Sanremo\"&gt;Sanremo&lt;/a&gt;, Italy, from 19 to 26 April 1920. The San Remo Resolution passed on 25 April 1920 determined the allocation of Class \"A\" &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Nations%20mandate\"&gt;League of Nations mandate&lt;/a&gt;s for the administration of three then-undefined &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; territories in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;: \"&lt;a href=\"Mandate%20for%20Palestine\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Mandate%20for%20Syria%20and%20the%20Lebanon\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Mandate%20for%20Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt;\". The boundaries of the three territories were \"to be determined [at a later date] by the Principal Allied Powers\", leaving the status of outlying areas such as &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Zor\"&gt;Zor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interregnum%20%28Transjordan%29\"&gt;Transjordan&lt;/a&gt; unclear.\nThe conference was attended by the four Principal &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Allied Powers of World War I&lt;/a&gt; who were represented by the prime ministers of &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"David%20Lloyd%20George\"&gt;David Lloyd George&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Millerand\"&gt;Alexandre Millerand&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Nitti\"&gt;Francesco Nitti&lt;/a&gt;) and by &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s Ambassador &lt;a href=\"Matsui%20Keishir%C5%8D\"&gt;Keishir\u014d Matsui&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior events.\nIt was convened following the February &lt;a href=\"Conference%20of%20London%20%281920%29\"&gt;Conference of London&lt;/a&gt; where the allies met to discuss the &lt;a href=\"partitioning%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;partitioning of the Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the negotiation of agreements that would become the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20S%C3%A8vres\"&gt;Treaty of S\u00e8vres&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 30 September 1918 supporters of the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Revolt\"&gt;Arab Revolt&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Damascus\"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt; had declared a government loyal to &lt;a href=\"Hussein%20bin%20Ali%2C%20Sharif%20of%20Mecca\"&gt;Sharif Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, who had been declared \"King of the Arabs\" by religious leaders and other notables in &lt;a href=\"Mecca\"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt;. During the meetings of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Four%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Council of Four&lt;/a&gt; in 1919, British Prime Minister Lloyd George stated that the &lt;a href=\"McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein%20Correspondence\"&gt;McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence&lt;/a&gt; was the basis for the &lt;a href=\"Sykes%E2%80%93Picot%20Agreement\"&gt;Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, which proposed an independent Arab state or confederation of states. In July 1919 the parliament of Greater Syria had refused to acknowledge any right claimed by the French Government to any part of Syrian territory.\nOn 6 January 1920 Hussein's son Prince &lt;a href=\"Faisal%20I%20of%20Iraq\"&gt;Faisal&lt;/a&gt; initialled an agreement with French Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Clemenceau\"&gt;Georges Clemenceau&lt;/a&gt; which acknowledged \"the right of the Syrians to unite to govern themselves as an independent nation\". A &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Pan-Syrian Congress&lt;/a&gt;, meeting in Damascus, had proclaimed an independent &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Kingdom%20of%20Syria\"&gt;Arab Kingdom of Syria&lt;/a&gt; on 8 March 1920. The new state included modern Syria and Jordan, portions of northern Mesopotamia which had been set aside under the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement for an independent Arab state or confederation of states, and nominally the areas of modern Israel-Palestine and Lebanon, although the latter areas were never under Faisal's control. Faisal was declared the head of state. At the same time &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Zeid%20bin%20Hussein\"&gt;Prince Zeid&lt;/a&gt;, Faisal's brother, was declared regent of Mesopotamia.\nAttendees.\nThe conference was attended by the allies, the US representative joining the meeting later in an observer capacity \nBritish Empire: \nFrance: \nItaly: \nJapan:\nInterpreter:\nUnited States of America (as observers):\nIssues addressed.\nThe peace treaty with Turkey, the granting of League of Nation mandates in the Middle East, Germany's obligations under the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Versailles Peace Treaty&lt;/a&gt; of 1919, and the Allies' position on Soviet Russia.\nAgreements reached.\nAsserting that not all parts of the Middle East were ready for full independence, mandates were established for the government of three territories: Syria, Mesopotamia and Palestine. In each case, one of the Allied Powers was assigned to implement the mandate until the territories in question could \"stand alone.\" Great Britain and France agreed to recognize the provisional independence of Syria and Mesopotamia, while claiming mandates for their administration. Palestine was included within the Ottoman administrative districts of the &lt;a href=\"Mutasarrifate%20of%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; together with the &lt;a href=\"Sanjak%20of%20Nablus\"&gt;Sanjak of Nablus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanjak%20of%20Acre\"&gt;Sanjak of Akka (Acre)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe decisions of the San Remo conference confirmed the mandate allocations of the Conference of London. The San Remo Resolution adopted on 25 April 1920 incorporated the &lt;a href=\"Balfour%20Declaration\"&gt;Balfour Declaration&lt;/a&gt; of 1917. It and Article 22 of the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20of%20the%20League%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Covenant of the League of Nations&lt;/a&gt; were the basic documents upon which the &lt;a href=\"Mandatory%20Palestine\"&gt;British Mandate for Palestine&lt;/a&gt; was constructed. Under the Balfour Declaration, the British government had undertaken to favour the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine without prejudice to the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. Article 22, para.4 of the Covenant, classified certain populations as \"communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire\" as having \"reached a stage of development where their existence as [an] independent nation can be provisionally recognized\" (the &lt;a href=\"League_of_Nations_mandate%23Types_of_mandates%20Class%20A%20mandates\"&gt;League_of_Nations_mandate#Types_of_mandates Class A mandates&lt;/a&gt;), and tasked the mandatory with rendering to those territories \"administrative advice and assistance until such time as they are able to stand alone\"\nBritain received the mandate for Palestine and &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;; France gained control of Syria, including present-day Lebanon. Following the &lt;a href=\"1918%20Clemenceau%E2%80%93Lloyd%20George%20Agreement%20%28Middle%20East%29\"&gt;1918 Clemenceau\u2013Lloyd George Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, Britain and France also signed the &lt;a href=\"San%20Remo%20Oil%20Agreement\"&gt;San Remo Oil Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, whereby Britain granted France a 25 percent share of the oil production from Mosul, with the remainder going to Britain and France undertook to deliver oil to the Mediterranean. The draft peace agreement with Turkey signed at the conference became the basis for the 1920 Treaty of S\u00e8vres. Germany was called upon to carry out its military and reparation obligations under the Versailles Treaty, and a resolution was adopted in favor of restoring trade with Russia.\nWhilst Syria and Mesopotamia were provisionally recognized as states which would be given Mandatory assistance, Palestine would instead be administered by the Mandatory under an obligation to implement the &lt;a href=\"Balfour%20Declaration\"&gt;Balfour Declaration&lt;/a&gt; and Article 22 of the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20of%20the%20League%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Covenant of the League of Nations&lt;/a&gt;. \nSan Remo Resolution \u2013 25 April 1920.\nIt was agreed \u2013\n(a) To accept the terms of the Mandates Article as given below with reference to Palestine, on the understanding that there was inserted in the &lt;a href=\"proc%C3%A8s-verbal\"&gt;proc\u00e8s-verbal&lt;/a&gt; an undertaking by the Mandatory Power that this would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine; this undertaking not to refer to the question of the religious protectorate of France, which had been settled earlier in the previous afternoon by the undertaking given by the French Government that they recognized this protectorate as being at an end.\n(b) that the terms of the Mandates Article should be as follows:\nThe High Contracting Parties agree that Syria and Mesopotamia shall, in accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 22, Part I (Covenant of the League of Nations), be provisionally recognized as independent States, subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The boundaries of the said States will be determined, and the selection of the Mandatories made, by the Principal Allied Powers.\nThe High Contracting Parties agree to entrust, by application of the provisions of Article 22, the administration of Palestine, within such boundaries as may be determined by the Principal Allied Powers, to a Mandatory, to be selected by the said Powers. The Mandatory will be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on the 8th [2nd] November, 1917, by the British Government, and adopted by the other Allied Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\n\"La Puissance mandataire s\u2019engage \u00e0 nommer dans le plus bref delai une Commission speciale pour etudier toute question et toute reclamation concernant les differentes communautes religieuses et en etablir le reglement. Il sera tenu compte dans la composition de cette Commission des interets religieux en jeu. Le President de la Commission sera nomm\u00e9 par le Conseil de la Societ\u00e9 des Nations.\"\n[The Mandatory undertakes to appoint in the shortest time a special commission to study any subject and any queries concerning the different religious communities and regulations. The composition of this Commission will reflect the religious interests at stake. The President of the Commission will be appointed by the Council of the League of Nations.]\nThe terms of the mandates in respect of the above territories will be formulated by the Principal Allied Powers and submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for approval.\nTurkey hereby undertakes, in accordance with the provisions of Article [132 of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres] to accept any decisions which may be taken in this connection.\n(c) \"Les mandataires choisis par les principales Puissances alli\u00e9s sont: la France pour la Syrie, et la Grande Bretagne pour la Mesopotamie, et la Palestine.\"\n[The officers chosen by the principal allied Powers are: France for Syria and Great Britain for Mesopotamia and Palestine.]\nIn reference to the above decision the Supreme Council took note of the following reservation of the Italian Delegation:\n\"La Delegation Italienne en consideration des grands inter\u00eats economiques que l\u2019Italie en tant que puissance exclusivement mediterran\u00e9enne poss\u00e8de en Asie Mineure, reserve son approbation \u00e0 la presente resolution, jusqu\u2019au reglement des inter\u00eats italiens en Turquie d\u2019Asie.\"\n[The Italian delegation, in view of the great economic interests that Italy, as an exclusively Mediterranean power, possesses in Asia Minor, withholds its approval of this resolution until Italian interests in Turkey in Asia shall have been settled.]\nSubsequent events.\nWhile Transjordan was not mentioned during the discussions, three months later, in July 1920, the French defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Kingdom%20of%20Syria\"&gt;Arab Kingdom of Syria&lt;/a&gt; state precipitated the British need to know 'what is the \"Syria\" for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?' and \"does it include Transjordania?\" \u2013 it subsequently decided to pursue a policy of associating Transjordan with the mandated area of Palestine but not to apply the special provisions which were intended to provide a national home for the Jewish people West of the Jordan \u2013 and the French proclaimed &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Lebanon\"&gt;Greater Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"French%20Mandate%20for%20Syria%20and%20the%20Lebanon\"&gt;other component states of its Syrian mandate&lt;/a&gt; on 31 August 1920.\nFor France, the San Remo decision meant that most of its claims in Syria were internationally recognized and relations with Faisal were now subject to French military and economic considerations. The ability of Great Britain to limit French action was also significantly diminished. France issued an ultimatum and intervened militarily at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Maysalun\"&gt;Battle of Maysalun&lt;/a&gt; in July 1920, deposing the Arab government and removing King Faisal from Damascus in August 1920. In 1920, Great Britain appointed &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Samuel%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Samuel\"&gt;Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel&lt;/a&gt; as high commissioner and established a mandatory government in Palestine that remained in power until 1948.\nArticle 22 of the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20of%20the%20League%20of%20Nations\"&gt;League of Nations Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, which contained the general rules to be applied to all &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Nations%20mandate\"&gt;Mandated Territories&lt;/a&gt;, was written two months before the signing of the Versaille Peace Treaty. It was not known at that time to which territories paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 would relate. The territories which came under the regime set up by this article were three former parts of the Ottoman Empire and seven former overseas possessions of Germany referred to in Part IV, Section I, of the treaty of peace. Those 10 territorial areas were originally administered under 15 mandates."
