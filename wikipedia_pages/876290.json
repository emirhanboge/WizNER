    "text": "ESPNews (pronounced \"ESPN News\", stylized ESPNEWS) is an American multinational &lt;a href=\"digital%20cable\"&gt;digital cable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"satellite%20television\"&gt;satellite television&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"television%20network\"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; owned by &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Inc.\"&gt;ESPN Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"joint%20venture\"&gt;joint venture&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Disney%20Media%20Networks\"&gt;Disney Media Networks&lt;/a&gt; division of &lt;a href=\"The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company\"&gt;The Walt Disney Company&lt;/a&gt; (which owns a controlling 80% stake) and the &lt;a href=\"Hearst%20Communications\"&gt;Hearst Communications&lt;/a&gt; (which owns the remaining 20%).\nKnown as \"ESPN3\" in its planning stages and proposed as early as 1993, the channel launched on November 1, 1996, and originally featured a &lt;a href=\"rolling%20news\"&gt;rolling news&lt;/a&gt; format with 24-hour coverage of sports news and highlights. Since 2010, the network has largely shifted away from this format, and now primarily carries television &lt;a href=\"simulcast\"&gt;simulcast&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Radio\"&gt;ESPN Radio&lt;/a&gt; shows, encores of ESPN's weekday lineup of studio programs, and overflow event programming in the event of conflicts with the other ESPN networks.\nAs of November 2021, ESPNews reaches approximately 59 million television households in the United States.\nFormat and programming.\nESPNews is typically offered on the digital tiers of U.S. cable providers, and is carried as a &lt;a href=\"pay%20television\"&gt;premium channel&lt;/a&gt; in some areas; satellite providers offer it on their standard package. Some &lt;a href=\"regional%20sports%20network\"&gt;regional sports network&lt;/a&gt;s that are not associated with &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Sports%20Networks\"&gt;Fox Sports Networks&lt;/a&gt; had previously aired ESPNews during the overnight or morning hours to provide a pseudo-national sportscast to their viewers, and to fill time that would otherwise be taken up by &lt;a href=\"informercial\"&gt;paid programming&lt;/a&gt; or other lower-profile programs, though as &lt;a href=\"vertical%20integration\"&gt;vertical integration&lt;/a&gt; has occurred with the sports networks now owned by &lt;a href=\"Comcast\"&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; (with &lt;a href=\"NBC%20Sports\"&gt;NBC Sports&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Charter%20Communications\"&gt;Charter Communications&lt;/a&gt;, ESPNews programming has been dropped from these networks; however, its programming is still carried during the overnight hours on &lt;a href=\"MASN2\"&gt;MASN2&lt;/a&gt;. If a national ESPN broadcast is &lt;a href=\"blackout%20%28broadcasting%29\"&gt;blacked out&lt;/a&gt; in a particular market, the ESPN broadcast will usually be replaced by ESPNews.\nThe network was formerly &lt;a href=\"simulcast\"&gt;simulcast&lt;/a&gt; on ESPN during coverage of major breaking sports news before that network expanded \"SportsCenter\" into additional daytime slots in 2008; additionally, &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s early morning newscast, \"&lt;a href=\"America%20This%20Morning\"&gt;America This Morning&lt;/a&gt;,\" previously ran a highlights segment rundown featuring sports news headlines and highlights of the previous night's sporting events presented by an ESPNews overnight anchor.\nThe channel's &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20BottomLine\"&gt;BottomLine&lt;/a&gt; ticker was formerly more in-depth than the versions used by ESPN's other networks. It contained not only scores, but also statistics and brief news alerts about the day's sports headlines. However, in June 2010, the network switched to the standard BottomLine and screen presentation used by all other ESPN networks in preparation for the launch of \"SportsCenter\" broadcasts..\nOn November 11, 2006, the channel marked its 10-year anniversary; programming commemorating the occasion included a montage of highlights covering the past 10 years in sports. The network began airing \"SportsCenter\" on nights when sporting event telecasts on ESPN and ESPN2, such as &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; games, were scheduled to overrun into the program's regular timeslots on ESPN and ESPN2's own sports analysis programs, which until 2010 would be the only incidences in which \"SportsCenter\" would be carried over to ESPNews.\n&lt;a href=\"XM%20Satellite%20Radio\"&gt;XM Satellite Radio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sirius%20Satellite%20Radio\"&gt;Sirius Satellite Radio&lt;/a&gt; both provide channels with audio simulcasts of ESPNEWS, with the network's television advertisements replaced with radio ads from each service. On February 4, 2008, XM rebranded its channel as \"&lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Xtra\"&gt;ESPN Xtra&lt;/a&gt;\", and added radio programs from local ESPN Radio affiliates as well as the audio simulcast of ESPNEWS.\nIn August 2010, telecasts of \"SportsCenter\" on ESPNews increased in frequency, now airing whenever ESPN or ESPN2 were unable to air the program due to scheduling conflicts, along with an afternoon expansion of \"SportsCenter\" to the channel's afternoon schedule rather than rolling \"ESPNews\"-branded coverage, while ESPN and ESPN2 carry sports talk and debate programming. \"The Beat\" (a show showing &lt;a href=\"popular%20culture\"&gt;pop culture&lt;/a&gt; and sports action to the tune of a beat) was shown while \"SportsCenter\" aired on ESPN at 6:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time until its cancellation in July 2011, and replacement by a rebroadcast of the ESPN2 sports talk program \"&lt;a href=\"SportsNation%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;SportsNation&lt;/a&gt;\". By early 2013, the only other programs featured on ESPNews were \"Highlight Express\" (a half-hour program showing the previous day's sports highlights, running from 10:00\u00a0p.m. to 3:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time in the afternoon), and the overnight soccer program \"ESPNFC Press Pass\". The network also airs programming under the \"&lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Live\"&gt;College Football Live&lt;/a&gt;\" banner on Saturday afternoons during college football season, a whip-around program similar to &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Goal%20Line\"&gt;ESPN Goal Line&lt;/a&gt;, which gives live look-ins to multiple college football games happening simultaneously.\nOn June 13, 2013, \"Highlight Express\" was canceled due to low ratings and company-wide downsizing, leaving the overnight \"ESPNFC Press Pass\", produced primarily for &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20International\"&gt;ESPN International&lt;/a&gt;, as the only program on the network that was exclusively broadcast (within the U.S.) on ESPNews; that program was removed from the schedule in August 2013, after it was supplanted by a new ESPN2 program simply titled \"ESPN FC\". Additional runs of \"SportsCenter\" and other same-day airings of ESPN sports debate programming or the newsmagazine \"\" now fill the network's schedule, along with encores such as \"&lt;a href=\"Boxing%20on%20ESPN\"&gt;Friday Night Fights&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as programming affected by sports-induced pre-emptions and overruns such as \"&lt;a href=\"Olbermann%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Olbermann&lt;/a&gt;\" during the US Open. The highlights and segment package for \"America This Morning\" came under the purview of the late-night \"SportsCenter\" team from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; from that day forward.\nOn November 29, 2017 as part of an expected announcement of 150 behind the scenes staffs being laid off from the network, ESPN announced that the primetime \"SportsCenter\" editions carried in primetime on ESPNews would be terminated after November 30 to cut costs (breaking sports news coverage will be maintained when needed). They were replaced by a block of reruns of ESPN and ESPN2's daytime talk programs, including \"&lt;a href=\"Around%20the%20Horn\"&gt;Around the Horn&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Highly%20Questionable\"&gt;Highly Questionable&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Outside%20the%20Lines\"&gt;Outside the Lines&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Pardon%20the%20Interruption\"&gt;Pardon the Interruption&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"SportsNation%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;SportsNation&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn March 2019, ESPNews premiered \"Daily Wager\", a new weekday studio show devoted to &lt;a href=\"sports%20betting\"&gt;sports betting&lt;/a&gt;. In August 2019, it was announced that \"Daily Wager\" would move to ESPN2 on August 20, and that ESPNews would add a new L-bar to its on-screen graphics during non-event programming (as well as during \"Daily Wager\" on ESPN2), featuring betting lines and other statistics. The feature is part of ESPN's partnership with the &lt;a href=\"sportsbook\"&gt;sportsbook&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Caesars%20Entertainment%20Corporation\"&gt;Caesars Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse as an overflow feed for live coverage.\nESPNEWS ran a simulcast of &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Radio\"&gt;ESPN Radio&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Mike%20and%20Mike%20in%20the%20Morning\"&gt;Mike and Mike in the Morning&lt;/a&gt;\" from 2004 to 2005; the program moved to ESPN2 in 2006, although it still occasionally airs on ESPNEWS when live sports events (such as tennis' &lt;a href=\"French%20Open\"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Championships%2C%20Wimbledon\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt;) air on ESPN2. When ESPN2 televised the &lt;a href=\"2009%20US%20Open%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;2009 U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt; tennis tournament, \"SportsNation\" aired on ESPNEWS instead from August 31 to September 11, 2009.\nAs &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Classic\"&gt;ESPN Classic&lt;/a&gt;'s carriage has declined more into specialty cable tiers due to bandwidth conservation concerns and low viewership, along with the fact that ESPN Classic does not yet have an HD simulcast channel (the former factors eventually led ESPN to transition ESPN Classic into a &lt;a href=\"video%20on%20demand\"&gt;video on demand&lt;/a&gt; service beginning in 2014), ESPNEWS has become the primary overflow network for situations in which ESPN and ESPN2 carry live sports coverage.\nAdditionally, ESPNEWS simulcasted &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Deportes\"&gt;ESPN Deportes&lt;/a&gt;' coverage of the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a\"&gt;2018 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;, the first time it has aired Spanish-language programming although the BottomLine ticker continued to be displayed in English.\nESPN Radio segment.\nIn 2007, ESPNEWS began broadcasting a half-hour segment of &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Radio\"&gt;ESPN Radio&lt;/a&gt; programming on Sunday mornings. The broadcast includes three commentators (a retired coach, a retired player, and an analyst) to break down the events of the featured sport, while an on-screen graphical list of standings, statistical leaders, and other statistics of the featured sport is displayed; the upper-right of the screen shows sports highlights (usually of the player or team of discussion); a fan comment board appears at the bottom of the screen, above the ESPNEWS BottomLine.\nHigh definition.\nESPNEWS operates a &lt;a href=\"High-definition%20television\"&gt;high definition&lt;/a&gt; simulcast feed, which broadcasts in &lt;a href=\"720p\"&gt;720p&lt;/a&gt; (the default resolution format for The Walt Disney Company's television properties) and was launched on March 30, 2008. Originally, the layout and graphics were reworked specifically for viewing on widescreen television sets, offering additional content not available on the channel's &lt;a href=\"standard-definition%20television\"&gt;standard definition&lt;/a&gt; feed. It utilized reworked HD sideline graphics, a descendant of the \"Rundown\" used on overnight editions of \"SportsCenter\" on ESPN, which wrapped around the top left and bottom of the widescreen picture. The HD Sideline offered the display of textual information, headshots, news and scores, while still delivering video highlights in the HD format.\nThe enhanced format was discontinued in June 2010 and the channel now broadcasts in near-fullscreen , with regular gray and red graphics similar to those used by the other ESPN channels. The move was made to \"accommodate the high number of \"SportsCenter\"s that moved to the network during the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOn May 20, 2012, ESPNEWS switched the presentation of its standard definition feed from to a downscaled &lt;a href=\"widescreen\"&gt;widescreen&lt;/a&gt; letterbox version of the HD feed, becoming the last ESPN network with a HD companion channel to make the conversion to a full-widescreen presentation. ESPNEWS HD was added to Dish Network on March 18, 2014, as part of a new carriage agreement that ended a four-year dispute that removed existing HD simulcast feeds of Disney-owned channels.\nInternational versions.\nWhile not operating under the ESPN name, &lt;a href=\"CTV%20Specialty%20Television\"&gt;CTV Specialty Television&lt;/a&gt; (which is partly owned by ESPN) operates &lt;a href=\"RDS%20Info\"&gt;RDS Info&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French-language&lt;/a&gt; sister network to &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9seau%20des%20sports\"&gt;R\u00e9seau des sports&lt;/a&gt; (RDS) (which in turn, is a sister network to the English language &lt;a href=\"The%20Sports%20Network\"&gt;TSN&lt;/a&gt;), which maintains a sports news format and ticker similar to that used by ESPNews, and carries continuous broadcasts of \"Sports 30\" (RDS's equivalent of \"SportsCenter\"). Until October 2011, when &lt;a href=\"RDS2\"&gt;RDS2&lt;/a&gt; was launched, RDS Info was also used as a part-time secondary outlet for RDS in the event of scheduling conflicts. It has since served as an occasional tertiary outlet for RDS programming, similar to the role now served by ESPNews.\n&lt;a href=\"Fox%20Sports%20%28Southeast%20Asian%20TV%20network%29\"&gt;ESPN Star Sports&lt;/a&gt; (a joint venture between &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20International\"&gt;ESPN International&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Networks%20Group%20Asia%20Pacific\"&gt;Star&lt;/a&gt;) operated an Asian version of ESPNews. It was renamed Fox Sports News in 2013, following &lt;a href=\"News%20Corporation%20%281980%E2%80%932013%29\"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt;'s full take over of ESPN Star Sports, before it was closed down in 2017."
