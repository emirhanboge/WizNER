    "text": "New York State Route\u00a037B (NY\u00a037B) is an east\u2013west &lt;a href=\"state%20highway\"&gt;state highway&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Lawrence%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;St. Lawrence County, New York&lt;/a&gt;, in the United States. It serves as a &lt;a href=\"business%20route\"&gt;business route&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%2037\"&gt;NY\u00a037&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Massena%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;village of Massena&lt;/a&gt;. While NY\u00a037B enters the village, NY\u00a037 bypasses it to the south. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY\u00a037 in the town of &lt;a href=\"Louisville%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt;. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY\u00a037 just east of the village limits in the &lt;a href=\"Massena%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;town of Massena&lt;/a&gt;. NY\u00a037B intersects North Main Street, a state-maintained northward extension of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%20420\"&gt;NY\u00a0420&lt;/a&gt;, in Massena's central district.\nThe origins of NY\u00a037B date back to the early 20th century when the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Legislature\"&gt;New York State Legislature&lt;/a&gt; created Route\u00a032, an unsigned &lt;a href=\"legislative%20route\"&gt;legislative route&lt;/a&gt; extending from North Lawrence to &lt;a href=\"Ogdensburg%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Ogdensburg&lt;/a&gt; via Massena. From &lt;a href=\"Waddington%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Waddington&lt;/a&gt; to Massena, Route\u00a032 followed River Road and Town Line Road. This portion of the route became part of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%203\"&gt;NY\u00a03&lt;/a&gt; in 1924. In the &lt;a href=\"1930%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;1930 renumbering of state highways in New York&lt;/a&gt;, the Waddington\u2013Massena segment of NY\u00a03 became NY\u00a037B. The route was extended east into Massena in the 1950s after NY\u00a037 was realigned to follow a new bypass around the village.\nMost of NY\u00a037B west of Massena ran through a low-lying area along the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Lawrence%20River\"&gt;St. Lawrence River&lt;/a&gt;. In 1958, this area was permanently indundated as part of the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Lawrence%20Seaway\"&gt;St. Lawrence Seaway&lt;/a&gt;'s construction. As a result, NY\u00a037B was rerouted to follow a new roadway along the fringe of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20St.%20Lawrence\"&gt;Lake St. Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; to meet NY\u00a037 in Louisville Corner. A connector between NY\u00a037 and NY\u00a037B in Louisville was designated as &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%20131\"&gt;NY\u00a0131&lt;/a&gt; by 1960. The alignments of NY\u00a037B and NY\u00a0131 west of Massena were swapped , placing NY\u00a037B on its modern alignment.\nRoute description.\nNY\u00a037B begins at an intersection with its parent route, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%2037\"&gt;NY\u00a037&lt;/a&gt;, in the town of &lt;a href=\"Louisville%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt;. The route heads to the northeast, paralleling the &lt;a href=\"Grasse%20River\"&gt;Grasse River&lt;/a&gt; as it passes a small number of homes and businesses located in the otherwise rural town. There are small patches of forested areas along the way to the &lt;a href=\"Massena%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Massena village&lt;/a&gt; line (and the town's line of the same name), where it intersects with Town Line Road (&lt;a href=\"County%20Route%2043%20%28St.%20Lawrence%20County%2C%20New%20York%29\"&gt;County Route\u00a043&lt;/a&gt;). Once in Massena, the amount of development along the highway begins to increase. NY\u00a037B, now known as Maple Street, continues northeast through Massena for three blocks before veering eastward upon passing Massena Memorial Hospital.\nIn the center of Massena, NY\u00a037B intersects North Main Street, which connects to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%20420\"&gt;NY\u00a0420&lt;/a&gt; south of the village. The portion of Main Street between NY\u00a0420 and NY\u00a037B is maintained by the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;New York State Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; as NY\u00a0970B, an unsigned &lt;a href=\"reference%20route%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;reference route&lt;/a&gt;. Past North Main Street, NY\u00a037B follows Maple Street southeast to Center Street. The route merges with Center Street and becomes a &lt;a href=\"divided%20highway\"&gt;divided highway&lt;/a&gt; as it connects to Willow Street by way of an interchange and intersects an eastward extension of Center Street.\nNY\u00a037B turns south at the interchange, becoming Parker Avenue and crossing over the Grasse River to meet East Orvis Street on the southern riverbank. Here, the route turns east to follow East Orvis Street northeastward through the residential and commercial areas that comprise southeastern Massena. At the &lt;a href=\"Massena%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Massena village&lt;/a&gt; line, East Orvis Street becomes Highland Road, a name NY\u00a037B retains for a short distance eastward to a junction with NY\u00a037 (St. Regis Boulevard). Although Highland Road continues through the intersection, NY\u00a037B ends at the junction.\nHistory.\nIn 1908, the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Legislature\"&gt;New York State Legislature&lt;/a&gt; created Route\u00a032, an unsigned &lt;a href=\"legislative%20route\"&gt;legislative route&lt;/a&gt; extending from North Lawrence to &lt;a href=\"Ogdensburg%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Ogdensburg&lt;/a&gt; via Winthrop and &lt;a href=\"Massena%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Massena&lt;/a&gt;. It entered Massena on what is now &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%20420\"&gt;NY\u00a0420&lt;/a&gt; and followed Main Street and Maple Street through the village. West of Massena, the highway was routed on Town Line Road and River Road to a junction east of &lt;a href=\"Waddington%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Waddington&lt;/a&gt;, where Route\u00a032 continued west on modern &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%2037\"&gt;NY\u00a037&lt;/a&gt; to Waddington. When state highways in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; were first posted in 1924, the portion of Route\u00a032 between Waddington and Massena became part of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%203\"&gt;NY\u00a03&lt;/a&gt;, a highway extending across the width of the state.\nThe segment of NY\u00a03 east of &lt;a href=\"Watertown%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Watertown&lt;/a&gt; was rerouted as part of the &lt;a href=\"1930%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;1930 renumbering of state highways in New York&lt;/a&gt; to largely follow its modern alignment between Watertown and &lt;a href=\"Plattsburgh%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Plattsburgh&lt;/a&gt;. Most of NY\u00a03's former alignment along the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Lawrence%20River\"&gt;St. Lawrence River&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Alexandria%20Bay%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Alexandria Bay&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hogansburg%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Hogansburg&lt;/a&gt; became part of the new &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%2037\"&gt;NY\u00a037&lt;/a&gt;; however, from Waddington to Massena, NY\u00a037 used a more inland routing. As a result, the former routing of NY\u00a03 between the two villages became NY\u00a037B instead. In the mid-to-late 1950s, NY\u00a037 was rerouted to follow a new bypass around the southern edge of Massena. Following its completion, NY\u00a037B was extended eastward along NY\u00a037's former routing on Maple Street, Parker Avenue, and Orvis Street to meet the bypass east of the village.\nIn the 1950s, construction began on the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Lawrence%20Seaway\"&gt;St. Lawrence Seaway&lt;/a&gt;, a system of canals and locks that would make the St. Lawrence River suitable for shipping. As part of the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; and New York between Waddington, New York, and &lt;a href=\"Cornwall%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Cornwall, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, would be inundated with water in order to create a navigable channel through the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Sault\"&gt;Long Sault&lt;/a&gt; rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY\u00a037B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July\u00a01, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a &lt;a href=\"cofferdam\"&gt;cofferdam&lt;/a&gt; upstream, creating what is now known as &lt;a href=\"Lake%20St.%20Lawrence\"&gt;Lake St. Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; and inundating the majority of NY\u00a037B west of Massena.\nFollowing the destruction of the majority of NY\u00a037B, the route was realigned west of Massena to follow a new riverside roadway to the &lt;a href=\"hamlet%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;hamlet&lt;/a&gt; of Louisville Corner, where it came to an end at NY\u00a037. The remainder of NY\u00a037B along the Massena\u2013&lt;a href=\"Louisville%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt; town line road and in Massena was unchanged. By 1960, a connector between NY\u00a037 in Louisville and NY\u00a037B and Massena utilizing NY\u00a037's former routing west of the village was designated as &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%20131\"&gt;NY\u00a0131&lt;/a&gt;. The alignments of NY\u00a037B and NY\u00a0131 west of the Maple Street\u00a0/ Town Line Road intersection were flipped , placing NY\u00a0131 on the riverside and town line roads and NY\u00a037B on NY\u00a037's former routing into Massena."
