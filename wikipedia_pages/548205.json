    "text": "Marcia Rachel Clark (' Kleks, formerly Horowitz; born August 31, 1953) is an American &lt;a href=\"prosecutor\"&gt;prosecutor&lt;/a&gt;, author, &lt;a href=\"correspondent\"&gt;television correspondent&lt;/a&gt; and television producer. She is known for being the lead prosecutor in the infamous &lt;a href=\"O.%20J.%20Simpson%20murder%20case\"&gt;O. J. Simpson murder case&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education.\nClark was born Marcia Rachel Kleks in &lt;a href=\"Alameda%2C%20California\"&gt;Alameda&lt;/a&gt;, California, the daughter of Rozlyn (n\u00e9e Masur) and Abraham Kleks. Her father was born and raised in Israel, and worked as a chemist for the &lt;a href=\"Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration\"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;. She was raised in a Jewish family. She has a younger brother by six years who became an engineer. Due to her father's job with the FDA, the family moved many times, living in California, New York, Michigan, and Maryland.\nKleks graduated from &lt;a href=\"Susan%20E.%20Wagner%20High%20School\"&gt;Susan E. Wagner High School&lt;/a&gt;, a public school in the &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Heights\"&gt;Manor Heights&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=\"Staten%20Island\"&gt;Staten Island&lt;/a&gt;, New York City. She studied at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, graduating in 1976 with a degree in political science, then earned a &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Doctor\"&gt;Juris Doctor&lt;/a&gt; degree at &lt;a href=\"Southwestern%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Southwestern University School of Law&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nAttorney.\nClark was admitted to the &lt;a href=\"State%20Bar%20of%20California\"&gt;State Bar of California&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. She was in private practice and worked as a &lt;a href=\"public%20defender\"&gt;public defender&lt;/a&gt; for the city of Los Angeles before she made a complete turnaround and became a prosecutor in 1981. She worked as a deputy district attorney for &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/a&gt;, California, and was mentored by prosecutor Harvey Giss.\nClark is best remembered as the lead prosecutor in the &lt;a href=\"O.%20J.%20Simpson%20murder%20case\"&gt;1995 trial&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"O.%20J.%20Simpson\"&gt;O. J. Simpson&lt;/a&gt; on charges of the murders of his ex-wife &lt;a href=\"Nicole%20Brown%20Simpson\"&gt;Nicole Brown Simpson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Goldman\"&gt;Ron Goldman&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to this trial, Clark's highest-profile prosecution was in 1991, when she prosecuted &lt;a href=\"Robert%20John%20Bardo\"&gt;Robert John Bardo&lt;/a&gt; for the murder of television star &lt;a href=\"Rebecca%20Schaeffer\"&gt;Rebecca Schaeffer&lt;/a&gt;.\nClark said that the media attention she received during the trial was \"the hell of the trial\", calling herself \"famous in a way that was kind of terrifying\". Clark was advised by a jury consultant to \"talk softer, dress softer, wear pastels\" as a means to improve her image. She subsequently changed her hairstyle into a &lt;a href=\"Perm%20%28hairstyle%29\"&gt;perm&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Times\"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;\" described her as looking like \"&lt;a href=\"Sigourney%20Weaver\"&gt;Sigourney Weaver&lt;/a&gt;, only more professional\". \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" commented that \"the transformation was not entirely seamless\".\nCommentator and author.\nClark resigned from the District Attorney's office after she lost the O. J. Simpson case and left trial practice behind her. She and &lt;a href=\"Teresa%20Carpenter\"&gt;Teresa Carpenter&lt;/a&gt; wrote a book about the Simpson case, \"Without a Doubt\", in a deal reported to be worth $4.2 million.\nSince the Simpson trial, Clark has made numerous appearances on television, including being a \"special correspondent\" for \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Tonight\"&gt;Entertainment Tonight&lt;/a&gt;.\" She provided coverage of high-profile trials and reported from the &lt;a href=\"red%20carpet\"&gt;red carpet&lt;/a&gt; at awards shows such as the &lt;a href=\"Emmy%20Award\"&gt;Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt;s. She was a guest attorney on the short-lived television series \"&lt;a href=\"Power%20of%20Attorney%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Power of Attorney&lt;/a&gt;\", and was also featured on \"&lt;a href=\"Headline%20News\"&gt;Headline News&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"HLN\"), where she analyzed the &lt;a href=\"Casey%20Anthony\"&gt;Casey Anthony&lt;/a&gt; trial. In July 2013, Clark provided commentary for &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"trial%20of%20George%20Zimmerman\"&gt;trial of George Zimmerman&lt;/a&gt; in Florida for the homicide of &lt;a href=\"Trayvon%20Martin\"&gt;Trayvon Martin&lt;/a&gt;.\nClark wrote a &lt;a href=\"TV%20pilot\"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; script for a TV series called \"Borderland\", centering on \"a very dark version of the DA's office\", which was purchased by &lt;a href=\"FX%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;FX&lt;/a&gt; but never produced. She has contributed &lt;a href=\"true%20crime\"&gt;true crime&lt;/a&gt; articles to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Beast\"&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt;\".\nClark has written several novels. Her \"Rachel Knight\" series centers on a prosecutor in the Los Angeles District Attorney's office, and includes \"Guilt By Association\" (2011), \"Guilt By Degrees\" (2012), \"Killer Ambition\" (2013), and \"The Competition\" (2014). \"Guilt by Association\" was adapted as a television pilot for &lt;a href=\"TNT%20%28U.S.%20TV%20network%29\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.\nIn contrast, Clark's \"Samantha Brinkman\" series features a woman who is a defense attorney. It includes \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Defense\"&gt;Blood Defense&lt;/a&gt;\" (2016), \"&lt;a href=\"Moral%20Defense\"&gt;Moral Defense&lt;/a&gt;\" (2016), and \"&lt;a href=\"Snap%20Judgment%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Snap Judgment&lt;/a&gt;\" (2017), and is being adapted into a TV series for &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, co-written by Clark. Clark never expected to be an author, but said, \"As a lawyer, I came to understand early that storytelling plays a very important part when you address a jury. So I guess my instincts have always kind of been there when it comes to weaving a narrative.\" She read \"&lt;a href=\"Nancy%20Drew\"&gt;Nancy Drew&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hardy%20Boys\"&gt;The Hardy Boys&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"mystery%20fiction\"&gt;mystery fiction&lt;/a&gt; as a child, and said \"I have been addicted to crime since I was born. I was making up crime stories when I was a 4- or 5-year-old kid.\"\nIn popular culture.\nIn August 2013, Clark appeared as Attorney Sidney Barnes in the \"&lt;a href=\"Pretty%20Little%20Liars%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/a&gt;\" episode, \"&lt;a href=\"Now%20You%20See%20Me%2C%20Now%20You%20Don%27t%20%28Pretty%20Little%20Liars%29\"&gt;Now You See Me, Now You Don't&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2015, Clark was parodied on the sitcom \"&lt;a href=\"Unbreakable%20Kimmy%20Schmidt\"&gt;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;\" in the form of the character \"Marcia\", implied to be Marcia Clark, now in a relationship with \"Chris\" Darden, portrayed by &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Fey\"&gt;Tina Fey&lt;/a&gt;. Fey was nominated for a &lt;a href=\"Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Guest%20Actress%20in%20a%20Comedy%20Series\"&gt;Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series&lt;/a&gt; for the role.\nClark appears in the 2016 documentary miniseries '. She is played by &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Paulson\"&gt;Sarah Paulson&lt;/a&gt; in the 2016 television series ', which focuses on the O. J. Simpson trial. Paulson's performance as Clark earned wide acclaim, and she earned a &lt;a href=\"Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Lead%20Actress%20in%20a%20Limited%20Series%20or%20Movie\"&gt;Primetime Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Globe%20Award\"&gt;Golden Globe Award&lt;/a&gt; for the role. Clark attended the Emmy Awards with Paulson on September 18, 2016. Katey Rich wrote in \"&lt;a href=\"Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt;\" that the series positions Clark as a \"feminist hero\".\nIn 2019, Clark appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Hell%27s%20Kitchen%20%28American%20season%2018%29\"&gt;18th season&lt;/a&gt; finale of &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Ramsay\"&gt;Gordon Ramsay&lt;/a&gt;'s reality series \"&lt;a href=\"Hell%27s%20Kitchen%20%28American%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Hell's Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;\" as a VIP guest diner for winner and &lt;a href=\"Hell%27s%20Kitchen%20%28American%20season%206%29\"&gt;season six&lt;/a&gt; veteran Ariel Contreras-Fox.\nPersonal life.\nWhen Clark was 17 years old, she was raped on a trip to &lt;a href=\"Eilat\"&gt;Eilat&lt;/a&gt;, Israel. She has said it was an experience she did not deal with until much later, and that it influenced much of why she became a prosecutor.\nIn 1976, Clark married Gabriel Horowitz, an Israeli professional &lt;a href=\"backgammon\"&gt;backgammon&lt;/a&gt; player whom she met while they were students at UCLA. \n They obtained a \"&lt;a href=\"Mexican%20divorce\"&gt;Tijuana divorce&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1980, and had no children. Horowitz was briefly in the news after he sold topless photos of Clark to the \"&lt;a href=\"National%20Enquirer\"&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/a&gt;\" during the O. J. Simpson trial.\nIn 1980, Clark married her second husband, Gordon Clark, a computer programmer and systems administrator who was employed at the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Scientology\"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;. They were divorced in 1995 and had two sons, born circa 1990 and 1992. Gordon argued at a custody hearing during the Simpson trial that he should receive full custody of their children due to the long hours Marcia spent working for the trial.\nClark no longer considers herself a religious person, although she was raised Jewish and her first wedding was a &lt;a href=\"conservative%20Judaism\"&gt;Conservative Jewish&lt;/a&gt; ceremony. She was a member of the Church of Scientology but since 1980 is no longer associated with it.\nShe resides in &lt;a href=\"Calabasas%2C%20California\"&gt;Calabasas, California&lt;/a&gt;."
