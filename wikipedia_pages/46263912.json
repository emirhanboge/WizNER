    "text": "R\u00e9alit\u00e9s was a French monthly of the post World War II era which commenced publication in February 1946, flourishing during the \"&lt;a href=\"Trente%20Glorieuses\"&gt;Trente Glorieuses&lt;/a&gt;\", a period of optimism, recovery and prosperity in France after the austerity of &lt;a href=\"German%20military%20administration%20in%20occupied%20France%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Occupation&lt;/a&gt;, ceasing in 1978 in France, although the later US edition continued until 1981. Its articles ranged across French culture, economy and politics, and featured profusely illustrated stories of interest to tourists, especially those traveling to French colonies.\nEditorial objectives.\nThe magazine's founders were entrepreneurs Humbert Frerejean (1914-2001) and Didier R\u00e9mon (1922\u2013), the editor Alfred Max, and first artistic director Alfred Brandler, replaced in 1950 by &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Edouard%20Gilou\"&gt;Albert Gilou&lt;/a&gt;. They proclaimed an intention to produce a high-class, profusely-illustrated publication which was to be outward-looking, an 'observatory on the world', after the years of Occupation during which information about the rest of the world was restricted. In a mission statement they expressed interest in leading readers to discover \"how the other lives, whether a thousand kilom\u00e8tres away or close by, how they eat, dress, work, love, entertain\". (\"Comment vit l'autre, \u00e0 des milleurs de kilom\u00e8tres ou \u00e0 proximit\u00e9, comment il mange, s'habille, travail, aime, s'amuse.\").\nIn November 1946 Didier R\u00e9mon created \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9tudes et de publications \u00e9conomiques\" (SEPE) (Society of studies and business publications), registering \"R\u00e9alit\u00e9s\" as a press and publishing group, and which from 1960 becomes part of the &lt;a href=\"Hachette%20%28publisher%29\"&gt;Hachette&lt;/a&gt; group. From 1947 the magazine included a literary supplement, with theatre plays, novels, or topical documents, and other supplements and special issues devoted to visual arts, fashion, business affairs, children and youth, followed. In November 1956, after 130 issues, the title merged with \"Femina-Illustration\" founded by &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne%20Gordon-Lazareff\"&gt;H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Gordon-Lazareff&lt;/a&gt;. Its offices were then installed in the L'Illustration building, at 13 rue Saint-Georges (Paris). Until May 1964, the magazine was called \"R\u00e9alit\u00e9s Femina-Illustration\", having absorbed the old \"Monde illustr\u00e9\" in the process. In June 1964, R\u00e9alit\u00e9s resumed its original title and came under the direction of Robert Salmon. After number 390, the title merged in December 1978 with \"Le Spectacle du monde\".\nReadership and influence.\nColourful, slick and glossy, roughly A4 in size (slightly larger than 8 \u00bd\u201d x 11\u201d), and costing 150 &lt;a href=\"franc\"&gt;franc&lt;/a&gt;s per issue (approximately the value of $US25-$US30 in 2015), \"R\u00e9alit\u00e9s\" catered to the sophisticated and wealthy reader. In its early years at least, on average, 160,000 copies were distributed each month, mostly by &lt;a href=\"Subscription%20business%20model\"&gt;subscription&lt;/a&gt;. Its content included stories on the economy and politics alongside articles of interest to tourists and on French culture.\nThe publisher of R\u00e9alit\u00e9s, the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9tudes et publications \u00e9conomiques, \"received funding from the 'Mission France' initiative of the &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Plan\"&gt;Marshall Plan&lt;/a&gt;. It therefore also served to promote American culture and political influence in France and Europe, which was prompted by a pervasive American &lt;a href=\"francophile\"&gt;francophilia&lt;/a&gt; and perception of France as a frontier against &lt;a href=\"Nazi\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; resurgence and &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; influence. Copies were circulated in &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;. From as early as 1952 the magazine was also issued in the UK in an English language edition; additionally, there was an edition for the United States, \"R\u00e9alit\u00e9s in America\" (c.1949\u20131974, later relaunched in January 1979 as \"R\u00e9alit\u00e9s\" but ceasing publication again in 1981) and in 1971 a Japanese-language version was launched.\nPhotography.\nPhotography was given central place in the magazine under art director &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Edouard%20Gilou\"&gt;Albert Gilou&lt;/a&gt;. In 1949, photographs replaced the hand-drawn illustration which had hitherto appeared on each cover of \"R\u00e9alit\u00e9s\". Covers were devoted to photos which would generate surprise, intrigue or mystery, but not shock or horror. All sorts of images were employed but the dominant genre, at least through the early years, was &lt;a href=\"humanist%20photography\"&gt;humanist photography&lt;/a&gt;, in particular that of staffers &lt;a href=\"%C3%89douard%20Boubat\"&gt;\u00c9douard Boubat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jean-Philippe%20Charbonnier\"&gt;Jean-Philippe Charbonnier&lt;/a&gt;, espousing the optimistic values of the contemporary exhibition &lt;a href=\"The%20Family%20of%20Man\"&gt;The Family of Man&lt;/a&gt; in which both exhibited. An emphasis on photography helped promote the reputation of the publication. Among the photographers (of whom, after 1950, &lt;a href=\"%C3%89douard%20Boubat\"&gt;\u00c9douard Boubat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jean-Philippe%20Charbonnier\"&gt;Jean-Philippe Charbonnier&lt;/a&gt;, Gilles Ehrmann and &lt;a href=\"Jean-Louis%20Swiners\"&gt;Jean-Louis Swiners&lt;/a&gt; became salaried employees) were contributors &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Savitry\"&gt;\u00c9mile Savitry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Cartier-Bresson\"&gt;Henri Cartier-Bresson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Doisneau\"&gt;Robert Doisneau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20Burri\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 Burri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Steichen\"&gt;Edward Steichen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Capa\"&gt;Robert Capa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Klein%20%28photographer%29\"&gt;William Klein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Avedon\"&gt;Richard Avedon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Irving%20Penn\"&gt;Irving Penn&lt;/a&gt;. At first each issue carried sixty pictures in black and white, though the magazine printed colour photographs from 1950. Then, from the mid sixties, most images were in colour, almost exclusively so from the late sixties. Photo essays often extended over twenty pages. &lt;a href=\"Edouard%20Boubat\"&gt;Edouard Boubat&lt;/a&gt;, who was on staff 1951\u20131965, described the experience of working for \"R\u00e9alit\u00e9s\": \nCessation.\n\"R\u00e9alit\u00e9s\" magazine was most influential between the years 1950 and 1970, employing a journalistic style of long articles associated with pictorial illustration which is now generally replaced by other media. Its last French edition was published in December 1978 with the number 390, and it was then absorbed by \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Spectacle%20du%20Monde\"&gt;Le Spectacle du Monde&lt;/a&gt;\". The US edition was however relaunched in January 1979, although it only lasted two years."
