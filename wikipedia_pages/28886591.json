The headwaters of the Howqua River rise below &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Howitt\"&gt;Mount Howitt&lt;/a&gt; in the western slopes of the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Alps\"&gt;Victorian Alps&lt;/a&gt;, and descend to flow into the &lt;a href=\"Goulburn%20River\"&gt;Goulburn River&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Eildon\"&gt;Lake Eildon&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation and features.\nThe river rises below Mount Howitt on the western slopes of the Victorian Alps, within the &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20National%20Park\"&gt;Alpine National Park&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shire%20of%20Mansfield\"&gt;Shire of Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;. The river flow generally west, joined by five minor tributaries, before reaching its &lt;a href=\"confluence\"&gt;confluence&lt;/a&gt; with the Goulburn River within Lake Eildon, created by the Eildon Weir. The river descends over its &lt;a href=\"watercourse\"&gt;course&lt;/a&gt;.\nCultural references.\nThe Howqua valley was seasonally occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Taungurong\"&gt;Taungurong&lt;/a&gt; people with the valley being a major route for trade or war between tribes in the area. The Howqua River valley contains a number of archaeological sites of significance including at least two quarry sites for &lt;a href=\"Greenschist\"&gt;greenstone&lt;/a&gt;, an exceptionally hard rock used for stone axes, spears and other cutting tools which the Taungurong traded with other tribes.\nThe character of Billy Slim in &lt;a href=\"Nevil%20Shute\"&gt;Nevil Shute&lt;/a&gt;'s 1952 novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Far%20Country%20%281952%20novel%29\"&gt;The Far Country&lt;/a&gt;\" was based on Fred Fry, a notable fly fisherman, who constructed several huts along the Howqua River and eked out a quiet existence in the river valley.\nThe Howqua River was one of just thirteen locations worldwide featured on the &lt;a href=\"fly%20fishing\"&gt;fly fishing&lt;/a&gt; documentary television series \"&lt;a href=\"A%20River%20Somewhere\"&gt;A River Somewhere&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEtymology.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Aboriginal%20languages\"&gt;Aboriginal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Woiwurrung%20language\"&gt;Woiwurrung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daungwurrung%20language\"&gt;Daungwurrung&lt;/a&gt; languages, the river is named Pyerlite, with no clearly defined meaning.\nThere are four possible origins of the river's current name: firstly, after John \"Howka\" Hunter (1820\u201368), a &lt;a href=\"Pastoral%20farming\"&gt;pastoralist&lt;/a&gt;; secondly, a &lt;a href=\"portmanteau\"&gt;portmanteau&lt;/a&gt; name from Mount Howitt, where the river rises, and \"aqua\"; thirdly, after Howqua, a popular brand of Chinese tea in the early nineteenth century; and fourthly, after Akin Howqua (Ah Kin Wowqua), a Chinese surveyor and early resident of Melbourne."
