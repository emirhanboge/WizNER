    "text": "Boom! Studios (styled BOOM! Studios) is an &lt;a href=\"American%20comic%20book\"&gt;American comic book&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"graphic%20novel\"&gt;graphic novel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"publisher\"&gt;publisher&lt;/a&gt;, headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIn the early 2000s, &lt;a href=\"Ross%20Richie\"&gt;Ross Richie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Cosby\"&gt;Andrew Cosby&lt;/a&gt; had been working in &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, helping to option comic book projects as producers and working to develop them into films with the studios, but were getting increasingly frustrated with the process. Richie planned to start Boom! to get away from Hollywood.\nBefore Boom!, Richie and Cosby worked briefly with Dave Elliott and Garry Leach in 2004 to revive 1980s comic book publishing house &lt;a href=\"Atomeka%20Press\"&gt;Atomeka Press&lt;/a&gt;. While working with Atomeka, Richie cut a deal with &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Giffen\"&gt;Keith Giffen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J.M.%20DeMatteis\"&gt;J.M. DeMatteis&lt;/a&gt; to publish their series \"&lt;a href=\"Hero%20Squared\"&gt;Hero Squared&lt;/a&gt;,\" with the \"Hero Squared X-Tra Sized Special\" one-shot. When Giffen was featured as a guest at the Los Angeles Comic Book and Science Fiction Convention, he grabbed a drink with Richie after the show and persuaded him to part ways with Atomeka Press, and start his own outfit, Boom!. Boom!'s first publication was \"Zombie Tales\" #1, a horror zombie anthology, released under the Boom! and Atomeka Press logos on June 29, 2005. The issue was originally solicited by Atomeka but released after Richie had left the company to start Boom! Studios. Giffen and DeMatteis imported their \"Hero Squared\" series from Atomeka to Boom! and \"Hero Squared\" became the very first Boom! comic book solicited solely under the Boom! logo, shipping July 27, 2005.\nDuring this time in its history, Boom! focused on publishing an array of original series created by a slew of industry veterans: Giffen worked on \"Hero Squared\", \"Planetary Brigade\", \"10\", \"Jeremiah Harm\", and the Tales titles like \"Zombie Tales\" and \"Cthulhu Tales\". DeMatteis collaborated with Giffen on \"Hero Squared\" and \"Planetary Brigade\" and brought his own series, \"The Stardust Kid\", with &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Ploog\"&gt;Mike Ploog&lt;/a&gt;, over from &lt;a href=\"Image%20Comics\"&gt;Image Comics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Mignola\"&gt;Mike Mignola&lt;/a&gt; and Troy Nixey's &lt;a href=\"Oni%20Press\"&gt;Oni Press&lt;/a&gt; series \"Jenny Finn\" migrated to Boom! and finally completed its story. Eisner Award winner Dave Johnson created covers for \"Zombie Tales\" and \"Cthulhu Tales\". &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Casey\"&gt;Joe Casey&lt;/a&gt; created \"The Black Plague\" while &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Albuquerque%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Rafael Albuquerque&lt;/a&gt;'s first American work debuted in \"The Savage Brothers\".\n2006 saw Boom! move into licensing for the first time with the debut of &lt;a href=\"Games%20Workshop\"&gt;Games Workshop&lt;/a&gt; series \"&lt;a href=\"Warhammer%2040%2C000\"&gt;Warhammer 40,000&lt;/a&gt;: Damnation Crusade\", based on the popular miniatures game of the same name.\nIn 2007, Boom! published &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Grant\"&gt;Steven Grant&lt;/a&gt;'s crime/action comic \"&lt;a href=\"2%20Guns\"&gt;2 Guns&lt;/a&gt;\" which Cosby and Ritchie co-produced for Universal Studios in 2013.\nAt the 2007 &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Comic%20Con\"&gt;San Diego Comic Con&lt;/a&gt;, Boom! announced plans to launch its first imprint, a new line of comics for children originally announced with the name ZOOM!, but when the imprint launched in 2009, the imprint debuted as \"BOOM Kids!\". Boom! also signed a deal with Pixar to produce comic books based on their properties and secured newsstand distribution. The first included \"The Muppet Show\" by Roger Langridge and \"The Incredibles: Family Matters\" by Mark Waid and artist Marcio Takara. In February 2011, Boom! re-branded Boom! Kids as KaBoom!, re-focusing the imprint to be appealing to all ages rather than only children.\nAlso during the 2007 San Diego &lt;a href=\"Comic%20book%20convention\"&gt;Comic Con&lt;/a&gt;, Boom! announced the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Waid\"&gt;Mark Waid&lt;/a&gt; as Editor-in-Chief. This role would eventually grow to Chief Creative Officer in August 2010 before his eventual return to freelance work in December of that year. While in these leadership roles, Waid also created multiple successful titles, including \"&lt;a href=\"Irredeemable\"&gt;Irredeemable&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2009, which became Boom!'s longest-running series at that time, lasting 37 issues, and a sister book \"&lt;a href=\"Incorruptible\"&gt;Incorruptible&lt;/a&gt;\".\n2010s.\nFormer Managing Editor Matt Gagnon was promoted to Editor-in-Chief in July 2010.\nAt the beginning of 2013, the company launched its #WeAreBoom! campaign, spotlighting a philosophy that Boom! isn't just composed of its writers, artists, and staff but also of the fans that read its comics and the retailers that sell them. In June 2013, Boom! acquired &lt;a href=\"Archaia%20Studios%20Press\"&gt;Archaia Studios Press&lt;/a&gt;, merging it into Boom! and retaining it as a stand-alone imprint. In October 2013, Boom! signed a &lt;a href=\"first-look%20deal\"&gt;first-look deal&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"20th%20Century%20Fox\"&gt;20th Century Fox&lt;/a&gt; giving Fox the right of first refusal to develop any Boom! comic properties into a film or TV series, and Boom! would get &lt;a href=\"first-dollar%20gross\"&gt;first-dollar gross&lt;/a&gt; on any profits. As a publisher of creator-owned works, that share would be split between Boom! and the creator(s) of the adapted work.\nIn January 2015, Boom! launched \"Push Comics Forward\", a public relations campaign aimed at generating a discussion about how comic book publishing can become more inclusive and diverse.\nIn June 2017, 20th Century Fox purchased a minority stake in Boom! Studios, valued at $10 million. &lt;a href=\"The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company\"&gt;The Walt Disney Company&lt;/a&gt; inherited Fox's stake in Boom! Studios after &lt;a href=\"Acquisition%20of%2021st%20Century%20Fox%20by%20Disney\"&gt;Disney acquired 21st Century Fox's assets&lt;/a&gt; on March 20, 2019.\n2020s.\nIn April 2020, Boom! Studios established a first-look television deal with &lt;a href=\"Netflix\"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, while its first-look deal with 20th Century Studios/The Walt Disney Company remains in effect for film projects through 2021. More recently, ex-&lt;a href=\"Marvel%20Television\"&gt;Marvel Television&lt;/a&gt; employee Mark Ambrose joined the studio as head of television.\nImprints.\nBOOM! is composed of four main imprints: the core BOOM! brand, the All-Ages focused KaBOOM!, &lt;a href=\"Archaia%20Entertainment\"&gt;Archaia&lt;/a&gt;, and BOOM! Box.\nBoom! Studios.\nThe BOOM! Studios imprint publishes action-oriented fare which most appropriate for teens or older readers.\nOriginals.\nOriginals under the BOOM! banner explore a wide variety of genres from YA science fiction, like in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Woods%20%28comic%29\"&gt;The Woods&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"James%20Tynion%20IV\"&gt;James Tynion IV&lt;/a&gt; and Michael Dialynas, to horror/action like in the thriller \"Day Men\", which racked up \"Best Inker\" and \"Best Cover Artist\" &lt;a href=\"Harvey%20Awards\"&gt;Harvey Awards&lt;/a&gt; nominations for series artist &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Stelfreeze\"&gt;Brian Stelfreeze&lt;/a&gt; and sold to &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Pictures\"&gt;Universal Pictures&lt;/a&gt; as a movie.

In 2014, they announced an ongoing series written by Bemis called \"Evil Empire\", which ended after 12 issues.\nIn October 2020, Boom! will publish \"&lt;a href=\"BRZRKR\"&gt;BRZRKR&lt;/a&gt;\", a comic book series created and written by &lt;a href=\"Keanu%20Reeves\"&gt;Keanu Reeves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Kindt\"&gt;Matt Kindt&lt;/a&gt; and drawn by &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Garney\"&gt;Ron Garney&lt;/a&gt;.
