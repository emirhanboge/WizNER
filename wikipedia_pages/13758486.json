    "title": "French battleship Gaulois",
    "text": "Gaulois was one of three &lt;a href=\"Charlemagne%20class%20battleship\"&gt;\"Charlemagne\"-class&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pre-dreadnought%20battleship\"&gt;pre-dreadnought battleship&lt;/a&gt;s built for the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; () in the mid-1890s. Completed in 1899, she spent most of her career assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Commander-in-Chief%2C%20Mediterranean%20%28France%29\"&gt;Mediterranean Squadron&lt;/a&gt; (). The ship accidentally &lt;a href=\"Naval%20ram\"&gt;rammed&lt;/a&gt; two other French warships early in her career, although neither was seriously damaged, nor was \"Gaulois\".\nFollowing the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; in August 1914, \"Gaulois\" escorted troop convoys from &lt;a href=\"French%20North%20Africa\"&gt;French North Africa&lt;/a&gt; to France for a month and a half. She was ordered to the &lt;a href=\"Dardanelles\"&gt;Dardanelles&lt;/a&gt; in November 1914 to guard against a sortie into the Mediterranean by the ex-German &lt;a href=\"battlecruiser\"&gt;battlecruiser&lt;/a&gt; . In 1915, \"Gaulois\" joined British ships in &lt;a href=\"Naval%20operations%20in%20the%20Dardanelles%20Campaign\"&gt;bombarding Ottoman fortifications&lt;/a&gt;. She was badly damaged during one such bombardment in March and had to &lt;a href=\"Beaching%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt; herself to avoid sinking. She was refloated and sent to &lt;a href=\"Toulon%20arsenal\"&gt;Toulon&lt;/a&gt; for permanent repairs. \"Gaulois\" returned to the Dardanelles and covered the &lt;a href=\"Gallipoli%20campaign%23Evacuation\"&gt;Allied evacuation&lt;/a&gt; in January 1916. She was en route to the Dardanelles after a refit in France when she was torpedoed and sunk on 27 December by a German &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;; four crewmen were lost.\nDesign and description.\nThe \"Charlemagne\"-class ships were smaller versions of the preceding , albeit with an improved armament. They were &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;long overall&lt;/a&gt; and had a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of . At &lt;a href=\"deep%20load\"&gt;deep load&lt;/a&gt;, the ships had a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28ship%29\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; of forward and aft. They displaced normally, and at deep load. When serving as &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt;s, their crew numbered 750 men, but had 32 officers and 660 &lt;a href=\"naval%20rating\"&gt;ratings&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"private%20ship\"&gt;private ship&lt;/a&gt;s. The ships were powered by three &lt;a href=\"Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion\"&gt;vertical triple-expansion steam engines&lt;/a&gt;, each driving one shaft, using steam generated by 20 &lt;a href=\"Belleville%20boiler\"&gt;Belleville boiler&lt;/a&gt;s. These boilers were coal-burning with auxiliary oil sprayers and were designed to produce to give the \"Charlemagne\" class a speed of . During her &lt;a href=\"sea%20trial\"&gt;sea trial&lt;/a&gt;s, \"Gaulois\" reached a top speed of from . The ships carried enough coal to give them a range of at a speed of .\nThe \"Charlemagne\"s carried their &lt;a href=\"main%20battery\"&gt;main battery&lt;/a&gt; of four &lt;a href=\"Canon%20de%20305%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201893/96%20gun\"&gt;Canon de Mod\u00e8le 1893 gun&lt;/a&gt;s in two twin-&lt;a href=\"gun%20turret\"&gt;gun turret&lt;/a&gt;s, one each fore and aft of the &lt;a href=\"superstructure\"&gt;superstructure&lt;/a&gt;. Their &lt;a href=\"Battleship%20secondary%20armament\"&gt;secondary armament&lt;/a&gt; consisted of ten &lt;a href=\"Canon%20de%20138%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201893%20gun\"&gt;Canon de Mod\u00e8le 1893 guns&lt;/a&gt;, eight of which were mounted in individual &lt;a href=\"Casemate%23Single%20casemates%20%281889%20onwards%29\"&gt;casemates&lt;/a&gt; and the remaining pair in &lt;a href=\"gun%20shield\"&gt;shielded&lt;/a&gt; mounts on the &lt;a href=\"forecastle\"&gt;forecastle&lt;/a&gt; deck &lt;a href=\"amidships\"&gt;amidships&lt;/a&gt;. They also carried eight &lt;a href=\"Canon%20de%20100%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201891\"&gt;Canon de Mod\u00e8le 1893 gun&lt;/a&gt;s in open mounts on the superstructure. The ships' anti-&lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt; defences consisted of twenty &lt;a href=\"QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss\"&gt;Canon de Mod\u00e8le 1885&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20gun\"&gt;Maxim gun&lt;/a&gt;s, fitted in platforms on both masts, on the superstructure, and in casemates in the hull. The ships mounted four &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s, two on each &lt;a href=\"Broadside%20%28naval%29\"&gt;broadside&lt;/a&gt;, one submerged and the other above water. As was common with ships of their generation, they were built with a plough-shaped &lt;a href=\"naval%20ram\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Charlemagne\"-class ships had a complete &lt;a href=\"Belt%20armor\"&gt;waterline belt&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"nickel-steel\"&gt;nickel-steel&lt;/a&gt; armour that ranged in thickness from and was thickest amidships. The gun turrets were protected by of &lt;a href=\"Harvey%20armour\"&gt;Harvey armour&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"barbette\"&gt;barbette&lt;/a&gt;s had plates of the same type of armour. The main armoured &lt;a href=\"Deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; was thick and there was a thick splinter deck below it. The &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt; had a thick face and sides.\nConstruction and career.\n\"Gaulois\", named after the tribes that inhabited France during Roman times, was ordered on 22 January 1895 from the &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20de%20Brest\"&gt;Arsenal de Brest&lt;/a&gt;. Her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt; was being built in the &lt;a href=\"slipway\"&gt;slipway&lt;/a&gt; intended for \"Gaulois\" so the latter ship's construction was delayed until the former was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20naming%20and%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt;. \"Gaulois\" was &lt;a href=\"laid%20down\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 6 January 1896 and launched on 6 October of the same year. She was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; () on 15 January 1899. The ship was initially assigned to the Northern Squadron (), but was then assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the Mediterranean Squadron on 30 September, together with \"Charlemagne\".\nThe sisters remained based in &lt;a href=\"Brest%2C%20France\"&gt;Brest&lt;/a&gt; until they departed for Toulon on 18 January 1900. The following month, while exercising in the harbour at &lt;a href=\"Hy%C3%A8res\"&gt;Hy\u00e8res&lt;/a&gt;, \"Gaulois\" accidentally rammed the &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; , gouging a hole in the smaller ship. \"Hallebarde\" reached Toulon where she was repaired, while the battleship was barely damaged. On 18 July, after combined manoeuvres with the Northern Squadron, the ship participated in a &lt;a href=\"naval%20review\"&gt;naval review&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20France\"&gt;President of France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Loubet\"&gt;\u00c9mile Loubet&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Cherbourg\"&gt;Cherbourg&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, \"Gaulois\" and the Mediterranean Squadron participated in an international naval review by Loubet in Toulon with ships from Spain, Italy and Russia.\nIn October 1901, the 1st Battleship Division, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Rear-Admiral\"&gt;Rear-Admiral&lt;/a&gt; () &lt;a href=\"Leonce%20Caillard\"&gt;Leonce Caillard&lt;/a&gt;, was ordered to proceed to the port of &lt;a href=\"Mytilene\"&gt;Mytilene&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Lesbos\"&gt;Lesbos&lt;/a&gt;, then owned by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. After landing two companies of &lt;a href=\"Fusiliers%20Marins\"&gt;marines&lt;/a&gt; that occupied the major ports of the island on 7 November, &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Hamid%20II\"&gt;Abdul Hamid II&lt;/a&gt; agreed to enforce contracts made with French companies and to repay loans made by French banks. The 1st Division departed Lesbos in early December and returned to Toulon. In May 1902, the ship became the flagship of &lt;a href=\"Vice-Admiral\"&gt;Vice-Admiral&lt;/a&gt; () &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Fournier%20%28naval%20officer%29\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Fournier&lt;/a&gt; who led a small delegation to celebrate the unveiling of the &lt;a href=\"Major%20General%20Comte%20Jean%20de%20Rochambeau\"&gt;statue&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Donatien%20de%20Vimeur%2C%20comte%20de%20Rochambeau\"&gt;Comte de Rochambeau&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lafayette%20Square%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29\"&gt;Lafayette Square&lt;/a&gt;, Washington, D.C. On 23 May &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; was received aboard and the ship visited New York City and Boston before heading back to France. She made another port visit to &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, before arriving back at Toulon on 14 June.\nDuring exercises off &lt;a href=\"Golfe-Juan\"&gt;Golfe-Juan&lt;/a&gt; on 31 January 1903, \"Gaulois\" accidentally rammed \"Bouvet\". The latter was barely damaged, but \"Gaulois\" lost two armour plates from her bow; both &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;s were relieved of their commands. &lt;a href=\"Capitaine%20de%20vaisseau%20%28France%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; () &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Le%20Bris\"&gt;Pierre Le Bris&lt;/a&gt; assumed command of \"Gaulois\" on 20 March. In April 1904, she was one of the ships that escorted Loubet during his state visit to &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year, the ship made port visits in &lt;a href=\"Thessaloniki\"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt; and Athens, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, with the rest of the Mediterranean Squadron. A &lt;a href=\"wireless%20telegraph\"&gt;wireless telegraph&lt;/a&gt; was installed aboard \"Gaulois\" in December 1905. Together with the battleships and \"Bouvet\", the ship aided survivors of the April 1906 eruption of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Vesuvius\"&gt;Mount Vesuvius&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;, Italy. On 16 September she participated in an international naval review in &lt;a href=\"Marseilles\"&gt;Marseilles&lt;/a&gt;, together with British, Spanish and Italian ships.\nFor the rest of the decade, she participated in exercises with the Mediterranean Squadron and made several port visits in France and its dependencies. In January 1907, the ships was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Division and then to the 4th Battleship Division in July 1908 with her sisters. By 5 January 1909, the 4th Division had been reassigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron (). \"Gaulois\" sank the &lt;a href=\"target%20ship\"&gt;target ship&lt;/a&gt; on 18 March after she had been fired upon by four other battleships. By 5 January 1910 the divisions of the battle squadrons had been renumbered and the 4th Division was now the 1st Division of the 2nd Battle Squadron. The squadron was transferred to Brest where it replaced the former Northern Squadron on 27 February. Shortly afterwards, one of \"Gaulois\"s torpedoes moderately damaged the bow of the destroyer while training. On 1 August 1911 the 2nd Battle Squadron was renumbered as the 3rd Battle Squadron and \"Gaulois\" participated in a large naval review by President &lt;a href=\"Armand%20Falli%C3%A8res\"&gt;Armand Falli\u00e8res&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"Cap%20Brun\"&gt;Cap Brun&lt;/a&gt; on 4 September. The ship was reassigned to the Mediterranean Squadron on 16 October 1912 and she participated in a naval review by President &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20Poincar%C3%A9\"&gt;Raymond Poincar\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; on 10 June 1913. The 3rd Battle Squadron was dissolved on 11 November 1913 and the ship was assigned to the Complementary Division () together with \"Bouvet\" and her sister . In June 1914, the Navy planned to assign \"Gaulois\" to the Training Division of the Squadron as of October, but this was cancelled upon the outbreak of war in August.\nWorld War I.\nTogether with the older French pre-dreadnoughts, the ship's first mission in the war was to escort troop convoys from North Africa to France. Later in September, her main turrets required repairs in &lt;a href=\"Bizerte\"&gt;Bizerte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"French%20Tunisia\"&gt;French Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;, as the forward turret was having difficulty traversing. \"Gaulois\" was ordered to &lt;a href=\"Tenedos\"&gt;Tenedos Island&lt;/a&gt;, not far from the Ottoman &lt;a href=\"Gallipoli%20Peninsula\"&gt;Gallipoli Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, in November to guard against a &lt;a href=\"sortie\"&gt;sortie&lt;/a&gt; by the ex-German battlecruiser \"Yavuz Sultan Selim\", relieving the battleship which needed a refit in Toulon. \"Gaulois\" became the flagship of Rear-Admiral &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Paul%20Amable%20Gu%C3%A9pratte\"&gt;\u00c9mile Gu\u00e9pratte&lt;/a&gt; upon her arrival on 15 November. He transferred his flag back to \"Suffren\" when she returned on 10 January 1915.\nOn 19 February, \"Gaulois\" supported \"Suffren\" as the latter ship bombarded Ottoman forts covering the mouth of the Dardanelles. Late in the day, \"Gaulois\" bombarded the fort at Orhaniye Tepe on the Asian side of the strait. During the subsequent bombardment on 25 February, the ship anchored some from the Asiatic shore and engaged the forts at &lt;a href=\"Kum%20Kale\"&gt;Kum Kale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Helles\"&gt;Cape Helles&lt;/a&gt;. Their return fire was heavy enough to force \"Gaulois\" to up anchor before she could suppress their guns. Later in the day, she closed to within of the forts and engaged them with her secondary armament. During the day's action, the ship was hit twice, but these did little damage.\nOn 2 March, the French squadron bombarded targets in the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Saros\"&gt;Gulf of Saros&lt;/a&gt;, at the base of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Five days later, the French squadron attempted to suppress the Ottoman guns defending the Dardanelles while British battleships bombarded the fortifications. \"Gaulois\" was hit by a shell during this attack that caused little damage as it failed to detonate. Gu\u00e9pratte and his squadron returned to the Gulf of Saros on 11 March where they again bombarded Ottoman fortifications.\nThey returned to the Dardanelles to assist in the major attack on the fortifications planned for 18 March. British ships made the initial entry into the &lt;a href=\"strait\"&gt;strait&lt;/a&gt;, but the French ships passed through them to engage the forts at closer range. \"Gaulois\" was hit twice during this bombardment; the first shell struck the quarterdeck, but caused little damage other than deforming the deck. The second shell hit just above the waterline on the starboard bow and appeared to do little damage, but it had pushed in the armour plates below the waterline and opened up a hole by through which water flooded. Little could be done to staunch the inflow and Captain &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9-Casimir%20Biard\"&gt;Andr\u00e9-Casimir Biard&lt;/a&gt; decided to head for the &lt;a href=\"Rabbit%20Islands%20%28%C3%87anakkale%29\"&gt;Rabbit Islands&lt;/a&gt;, north of Tenedos, where he could beach his ship for temporary repairs. He ordered the non-essential crewmen off the ship in case she &lt;a href=\"foundered\"&gt;foundered&lt;/a&gt; en route, but managed to reach the islands, escorted by \"Charlemagne\".\n\"Gaulois\" was refloated on 22 March and departed for Toulon via &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Colony%20of%20Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; three days later, escorted by \"Suffren\". They encountered a storm on 27 March off &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Matapan\"&gt;Cape Matapan&lt;/a&gt; and the ship began taking on water as the repairs began to leak under the pressure of the storm. She radioed for assistance later that night and the &lt;a href=\"armoured%20cruiser\"&gt;armoured cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and three torpedo boats arrived several hours later. The ship arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Navarin\"&gt;Bay of Navarin&lt;/a&gt; the following morning and more repairs were made with the assistance of the crew of the &lt;a href=\"hulk%20%28ship%29\"&gt;hulked&lt;/a&gt; old battleship . \"Gaulois\" arrived without further incident at Toulon on 16 April and entered &lt;a href=\"drydock\"&gt;drydock&lt;/a&gt; the following day. The Navy took the opportunity to increase her stability by lightening her masts, removing some armour from the superstructure and conning tower as well as dismounting two 100\u00a0mm and six 47\u00a0mm guns. The ship was also fitted with &lt;a href=\"anti-torpedo%20bulge\"&gt;anti-torpedo bulge&lt;/a&gt;s () amidships to increase her beam and thus her stability.\nHer repairs were completed by early June and \"Gaulois\" departed for the Dardanelles on 8 June. She reached &lt;a href=\"Lemnos\"&gt;Lemnos&lt;/a&gt; on 17 June and relieved \"Saint Louis\" on 27 July. The ship anchored off the shore on 11 August to bombard an Ottoman &lt;a href=\"artillery%20battery\"&gt;artillery battery&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Achi%20Baba\"&gt;Achi Baba&lt;/a&gt;. Splinters from return fire detonated a 100\u00a0mm shell and started a small fire, but it was put out without much trouble. On her voyage home, \"Gaulois\" ran aground at the harbour entrance and had to unload most of her ammunition before she could be refloated on 21 August. Together with the pre-dreadnought , the ship covered the Allied evacuation from Gallipoli in January 1916. Badly in need of a refit, she sailed for Brest on 20 July where her captain argued that the range of her main armament needed to be increased by if she was to be considered fit for the battleline. Some thought was given to disarming her and converting her into a &lt;a href=\"barracks%20ship\"&gt;barracks ship&lt;/a&gt;, but nothing was done before the ship was ordered back to the Eastern Mediterranean on 25 November.\nFate.\nBy 27 December, \"Gaulois\" had reached the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Crete\"&gt;Sea of Crete&lt;/a&gt; and was off the southern coast of Greece when she was torpedoed by the at 08:03 despite being escorted by the torpedo boat and two armed &lt;a href=\"fishing%20trawler\"&gt;trawlers&lt;/a&gt;. The single torpedo hit slightly &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aabaft\"&gt;abaft&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"mainmast\"&gt;mainmast&lt;/a&gt; and started uncontrollable flooding below the waterline. It killed two crewmen and another pair drowned as they attempted to abandon ship; the rest of the crew was successfully rescued. The ship &lt;a href=\"capsized\"&gt;capsized&lt;/a&gt; at 09:03 and sank eight minutes later off &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Maleas\"&gt;Cape Maleas&lt;/a&gt; at in of water."
