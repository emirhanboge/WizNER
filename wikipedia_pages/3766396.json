The series features many fictional people and animals, including train drivers, footplate crews, workers and signalmen, whom interact with the railway engine and vehicle characters and form the basis for many of the varying storylines. \nMajor and recurring characters.\nSir Topham Hatt / The Fat Controller.\nSir Topham Hatt, also known as \"The Fat Controller\", is the controller of the North Western Railway on the island of &lt;a href=\"Sodor%20%28fictional%20island%29\"&gt;Sodor&lt;/a&gt;. He sometimes works on the &lt;a href=\"steam%20engine\"&gt;steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s himself, and as a young man he drove a steam-powered lorry named &lt;a href=\"Non-rail%20vehicles%20%28Thomas%20the%20Tank%20Engine%20and%20Friends%29%23Elizabeth\"&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;. Perceptive and shrewd, he has used elaborate schemes to get to the bottom of a problem. He is known in the series for his catchphrases \"You are a really useful engine\" when he is proud of his engines and \"You have caused confusion and delay\" when one of his engines messes up on something. He also scolds his engines.\nLady Hatt.\nLady Hatt is married to Sir Topham Hatt. Although her husband runs a railway, she likes a day out on a boat or in their car.\nStephen and Bridget Hatt.\nStephen Hatt and Bridget Hatt live on Sodor and regularly spend holidays with their grandparents, the Fat Controller and Lady Hatt. They spent a long holiday on &lt;a href=\"Toby%20the%20Tram%20Engine\"&gt;Toby's&lt;/a&gt; old line. Stephen Hatt was excited when he first met Toby, but Bridget Hatt accidentally offended him by assuming he was an electric tram. Some time later, after Toby came to Sir Topham Hatt\u2019s railway, the family traveled with Toby to an old castle and mine on a map the children found.\nFarmer Finney.\nFarmer Finney is the driver of Terence the Tractor.

While she was bedridden, an avalanche blocked the railway line by her house. By hanging a bright red dress from her window, she successfully stopped Thomas' train before it crashed. As a token of gratitude, Sir Topham Hatt paid for Mrs Kyndley to visit Bournemouth to get better. Years later, the other engines, hearing Thomas' story, wished to express thanks to Mrs Kyndley for helping the railway, and threw her a Christmas party at Tidmouth Sheds. Percy's crew helped to gather a good luck package for her daughter's wedding: Old Slow Coach (something old), a new set of buffers (something new), a flatbed (something borrowed), and Thomas (something blue). Once when her sister was unable to make a visit, Sir Topham Hatt went to great lengths to cheer Mrs. Kyndley up. She had a ride with Harold the Helicopter, then was taken by James to open the grounds at Harry Topper's Fair.\nJem Cole.\nJem Cole is Trevor's driver, and helped save him from scrap when Edward found him.
