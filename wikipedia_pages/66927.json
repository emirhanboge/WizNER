    "title": "Jesse Boot, 1st Baron Trent",
    "text": "Jesse Boot, 1st Baron Trent (2 June 1850 \u2013 13 June 1931) transformed &lt;a href=\"The%20Boots%20Company\"&gt;The Boots Company&lt;/a&gt;, founded by his father, &lt;a href=\"John%20Boot\"&gt;John Boot&lt;/a&gt;, into a national retailer, which branded itself as \"Chemists to the Nation\".\nBiography.\nBoot sold his controlling interest to American investors in 1920.\nJohn Boot offered his close friend and business associate John Harston, the opportunity of going into business with him, but Harston declined, feeling the venture was not worth investing in.\nBoot was a great benefactor to the &lt;a href=\"Nottingham\"&gt;City of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;. He donated land for the new University College at Highfields, now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Nottingham\"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;, which opened in 1928 and was presented with the Freedom of the City of Nottingham in 1920. He was also a significant benefactor to his wife's home, &lt;a href=\"Jersey\"&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoot was &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Bachelor\"&gt;knighted&lt;/a&gt; in 1909, created a &lt;a href=\"baronet\"&gt;baronet&lt;/a&gt; in 1917, and announced in the New Year's Honours of 1929 was elevated to the peerage, and created Baron Trent, of &lt;a href=\"Nottingham\"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Nottingham\"&gt;County of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt; on 18 March 1929. These latter honours probably owed as much to his solid support of the Liberal Party as to his &lt;a href=\"philanthropy\"&gt;philanthropy&lt;/a&gt; to the city of his birth.\nHe died in &lt;a href=\"Jersey\"&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt; in 1931. The Sir Jesse Boot Chair in Chemistry at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Nottingham\"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt; was named in his honour. His widow commissioned the French glass artist &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20Lalique\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 Lalique&lt;/a&gt; to refit the church of &lt;a href=\"St%20Matthew%27s%20Church%2C%20Millbrook\"&gt;St Matthew, Millbrook&lt;/a&gt; (popularly known as the \"Glass Church\") as a memorial to him.\nIn 1935 a Primary school was built in Nottingham, Jesse Boot's home town. The School was titled &lt;a href=\"The%20Jesse%20Boot%20Primary%20School\"&gt;The Jesse Boot Primary School&lt;/a&gt; and was located in Bakersfield, Nottingham. The School closed in 2009 after becoming an academy school.\nHis portrait, by &lt;a href=\"Noel%20Denholm%20Davis\"&gt;Noel Denholm Davis&lt;/a&gt;, is in the collection of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Nottingham\"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;. Another, by the same artist, is on loan to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London\"&gt;National Portrait Gallery&lt;/a&gt;."
