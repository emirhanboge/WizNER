    "text": "A Floral formula is a &lt;a href=\"notation\"&gt;notation&lt;/a&gt; for representing the structure of particular types of &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s. Such notations use numbers, letters and various symbols to convey significant information in a compact form. They may represent the floral form of a particular species, or may be generalized to characterize higher &lt;a href=\"taxon\"&gt;taxa&lt;/a&gt;, usually giving ranges of numbers of organs. Floral formulae are one of the two ways of describing flower structure developed during the 19th century, the other being &lt;a href=\"floral%20diagram\"&gt;floral diagram&lt;/a&gt;s. The format of floral formulae differs according to the tastes of particular authors and periods, yet they tend to convey the same information. \nA floral formula is often used along with a &lt;a href=\"floral%20diagram\"&gt;floral diagram&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFloral formulae were developed at the beginning of the 19th century. The first authors using them were Cassel (1820) who first devised lists of integers to denote numbers of parts in named whorls; and Martius (1828). Grisebach (1854) used 4-integer series to represent the 4 whorls of floral parts in his textbook to describe characteristics of floral families, stating numbers of different organs separated by commas and highlighting fusion. Sachs (1873) used them together with floral diagrams, he noted their advantage of being composed of \"ordinary &lt;a href=\"typeface\"&gt;typeface&lt;/a&gt;\". \nAlthough Eichler widely used floral diagrams in his \"Bl\u00fcthendiagramme\", he used floral formulae sparingly, mainly for families with simple flowers. Sattler's \"Organogenesis of Flowers\" (1973) takes advantage of floral formulae and diagrams to describe the &lt;a href=\"ontogeny\"&gt;ontogeny&lt;/a&gt; of 50 plant species. Newer books containing formulae include \"Plant Systematics\" by Judd \"et al.\" (2002) and Simpson (2010). Prenner \"et al.\" devised an extension of the existing model to broaden the descriptive capability of the formula and argued that formulae should be included in formal &lt;a href=\"Biological%20classification\"&gt;taxonomic&lt;/a&gt; descriptions. Ronse De Craene (2010) partially utilized their way of writing the formulae in his book \"Floral Diagrams\".\nContained information.\nOrgan numbers and fusion.\nThe formula expresses counts of different floral organs; these are usually preceded by letters or abbreviations according to the organ type. They are ordered corresponding to the arrangement of the parts of the flower from the outside to the inside:\nThe labels with darker backgrounds are less common. \"V\" used by Prenner \"et al.\" for the number of ovules per gynoecium is followed by lowercase letter describing the type of &lt;a href=\"Ovule%23Location%20within%20the%20plant\"&gt;placentation&lt;/a&gt;. For &lt;a href=\"epicalyx\"&gt;epicalyx&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"calyculus\"&gt;calyculus&lt;/a&gt;, the letter \"k\" is used.\nThe numbers are inserted after the labels, they may be formatted as sub- or superscript. If an organ is absent, its number is written as \"0\" or it is omitted, if there are \"many\" (usually more than 10\u201312) instances, it can be written as \"\u221e\". Whorls of the same organ are separated by \"+\". Organ counts within a whorl can be separated by \":\", for example when part of the whorl is morphologically different. A range can be given if the number is variable, e.g. when the formula summarizes a taxon.\nGroups of organs can be described by writing the number of instances in the group as superscript.\nThe formula can also express organ fusion. Fusion of one organ type can be shown by enclosing the number in a circle, fusion of different organs can be represented by &lt;a href=\"Tie%20%28typography%29\"&gt;ties&lt;/a&gt;, as e.g. in Judd \"et al.\" Prenner \"et al.\" state that this method is difficult to achieve via standard typesetting. Joining of organs can be more readily written using &lt;a href=\"parentheses\"&gt;parentheses&lt;/a&gt; \"(\u2026)\" if instances of the same organ are fused. Fusion between different organs can be achieved by &lt;a href=\"square%20brackets\"&gt;square&lt;/a&gt; \"[\u2026]\", eventually &lt;a href=\"curly%20brackets\"&gt;curly brackets&lt;/a&gt; \"{\u2026}\".\nPrenner \"et al.\" propose superscript zero for a lost organ, and superscript \"r\" for a reduced one. Ronse De Craene uses a &lt;a href=\"degree%20symbol\"&gt;degree symbol&lt;/a&gt; to mark a &lt;a href=\"staminode\"&gt;staminode&lt;/a&gt; (infertile stamen) or &lt;a href=\"pistillode\"&gt;pistillode&lt;/a&gt; (infertile carpel).\nOvary position is shown by alternating the \"G\" label. Simpson circumvents the intricate formatting by expressing the ovary position by words.\nSymmetry.\n&lt;a href=\"Floral%20symmetry\"&gt;Symmetry&lt;/a&gt; or arrangement may be described for the whole flower; in such case the corresponding symbol is usually placed at the beginning of the formula. It may be also outlined separately for different organs, placing it after their labels or numbers, or it may not be included in the formula at all. It is described by following symbols:\nSexuality.\nSexuality of the flower can be highlighted by \u263f or for hermaphrodite (bisexual), \u2642 for male (staminate) and \u2640 for female (pistillate) flower. The symbols are usually placed at the beginning of the formula, after or before the symmetry symbol. Prenner \"et al.\" recommend to use the corresponding symbols (\u2640 and \u2642) only for flowers of separate sexuality. Ronse De Craene utilizes the words \"pistillate\" or \"staminate\" instead of the symbols.\nFloral formula can also incorporate the fruit type, Judd \"et al.\" place it at the very end.\nBr.\n\u21af K3 [C3 A1\u00b0\u20133\u00b0+\u00bd:2\u00b0] \u011e(3) \u2013 the formula of \"&lt;a href=\"Canna%20indica\"&gt;Canna indica&lt;/a&gt;\"; asymmetric flower; calyx of three free sepals; corolla of three free petals joined with androecium; androecium in two whorls, the outer whorl contains 1\u20133 staminodes, the inner contains \u00bd of a stamen and 2 staminodes; gynoecium fused of 3 carpels, inferior ovary\nB BtC K3:(2)C\u2193 C3:2r\u2193 A(3):2r\u2193+4r:10 1\u2193 Vm8\u201310 \u2013 the formula of \"&lt;a href=\"Tamarindus%20indica\"&gt;Tamarindus indica&lt;/a&gt;\"; bract and petaloid bracteoles; monosymmetric calyx of three and two petaloid sepals; monosymmetric corolla of three and two reduced petals; two whorls of stamens, the outer monosymmetric from three fused and two reduced stamens, the inner of 4 reduced and 1 lost stamen; monosymmetric gynoecium of 1 carpel with superior ovary; marginal placentation with 8\u201310 ovules per gynoecium.\nUsing boxes.\n3-4 free sepals, 3-4 free petals (or absent), 2-8 stamens, inferior ovary with 2-4 fused carpels}} "
