    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20Buses\"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; B12BLE is a &lt;a href=\"Low-entry%20bus\"&gt;low-entry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"city%20bus\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"intercity%20bus\"&gt;suburban&lt;/a&gt; bus chassis launched in 2001 with a rear-mounted transverse engine. It superseded the &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20B10BLE\"&gt;Volvo B10BLE&lt;/a&gt; and is used as a base for &lt;a href=\"single-decker%20bus\"&gt;single-decker bus&lt;/a&gt;es in Europe and Australia.\nThe B12BLE features the 12-litre Volvo DH12 engine, which is based on the D12 engine from &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20FH\"&gt;Volvo FH&lt;/a&gt; trucks. The DH12D engine meets Euro 3 emission level, and DH12E meets levels 4 and 5 with SCR technology. The engine is mounted horizontally, as it was in the &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20B10BLE\"&gt;B10BLE&lt;/a&gt;. The radiator is mounted at the rear on the right-hand side.\nFrom its launch in 2001 until 2005, it was available with the Euro 3 DH12D engine and &lt;a href=\"ZF%20Friedrichshafen\"&gt;ZF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ZF%20Ecomat\"&gt;Ecomat2&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Voith%20DIWA\"&gt;Voith&lt;/a&gt; D864.3E automatic transmissions. From 2004/2005, the B12BLE was available with an updated electrical system. Available transmissions were 6-speed &lt;a href=\"ZF%20Friedrichshafen\"&gt;ZF&lt;/a&gt; 6HP602C, &lt;a href=\"Voith%20DIWA\"&gt;Voith DIWA&lt;/a&gt;864.3E and the &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20I-Shift\"&gt;Volvo I-Shift&lt;/a&gt;\nIn 2006 the chassis was updated with DH12E engine and &lt;a href=\"ZF%20Friedrichshafen\"&gt;ZF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ZF%20Ecomat\"&gt;Ecomat4&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Voith%20DIWA\"&gt;Voith&lt;/a&gt; D864.5 transmissions to meet Euro 4 &amp; 5 emission standards.\nThe B12BLE was also available in the &lt;a href=\"articulated%20bus\"&gt;articulated&lt;/a&gt; form since 2005, which is known as the B12BLEA chassis. The B12BLE can be available in the &lt;a href=\"rigid%20bus\"&gt;rigid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"multi-axle%20bus\"&gt;tri-axle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"articulated%20bus\"&gt;articulated&lt;/a&gt; form.\nThe B12BLE is also available as a complete integral bus in Europe - the &lt;a href=\"Volvo%208500\"&gt;Volvo 8500LE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Volvo%208700\"&gt;Volvo 8700LE&lt;/a&gt;.\nAustralia.\nNumerous public transport operators in Australia operate copious amounts of the B12BLE, either in its Euro III or Euro IV and Euro V guises.\nThe Volvo B12BLEA was conceptualised for the &lt;a href=\"State%20Transit%20Authority\"&gt;State Transit Authority&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, Australia because the &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20B7LA\"&gt;B7LA&lt;/a&gt; was too underpowered for many of Sydney's bus routes due to the hilly terrain. The world's first B12BLEA entered service with &lt;a href=\"State%20Transit%20Authority\"&gt;State Transit Authority&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; in late 2005.\n&lt;a href=\"State%20Transit%20Authority\"&gt;State Transit Authority&lt;/a&gt; has placed an order for 80 B12BLEA articulated buses, and they will be assembled with Custom Coaches bodywork. The custom buses are powered by the 12-litre Volvo DH12 diesel engine with 6-speed ZF 6HP602C and 6HP604C automatic transmission.\n&lt;a href=\"State%20Transit%20Authority\"&gt;State Transit Authority&lt;/a&gt; also ordered additional B12BLEA's in the Volgren CR228L body. The Volgren bodied buses are mostly seen running the high capacity Metrobus service. Most of the buses are built in Volgren's Tomago factory while the rest were built in Dandenong.\nThe Volvo B12BLE also come in a 12.5m configuration in Custom Coaches bodied CB60 and CB60 Evo 2 bodies. Volgren 12.5m variants were also ordered in both 12.5m and 14.5m bodies both Euro 5 complaint.\nThe 12.5m Custom Coaches CB60 are Euro 3 complaint while the newer CB60 Evo 2 bodied buses are Euro 5 complaint.\nIn October 2013, 20 B12BLEA's were transferred to new operator &lt;a href=\"Transit%20Systems%20Sydney\"&gt;Transit Systems Sydney&lt;/a&gt; who took over &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Metropolitan%20Bus%20Service%20Contracts\"&gt;Region 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2011, &lt;a href=\"Transperth\"&gt;Transperth&lt;/a&gt; ordered 30 Volvo B12BLEAs. They were to be assembled with &lt;a href=\"Volgren\"&gt;Volgren CR228L&lt;/a&gt; bodywork.\nMost of the B12BLE chassis that go to Australia are bodied by Australian companies such as &lt;a href=\"Custom%20Coaches\"&gt;Custom Coaches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Volgren\"&gt;Volgren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bustech\"&gt;Bustech&lt;/a&gt;.\nSingapore.\n2 Volvo B12BLEAs are operated by &lt;a href=\"Sentosa\"&gt;Sentosa&lt;/a&gt; under the guise of a beach tram running on the island's Siloso Beach Tram route. The rear module of the bus consists of a large, sheltered standing area with an al-fresco seating area on the elevated part of the bus where the drive axle is. The buses are bodied by &lt;a href=\"ComfortDelGro%23Automotive%20engineering%20%26amp%3B%20vehicle%20inspection\"&gt;ComfortDelGro Engineering&lt;/a&gt; Corporation and are speed-limited for safety reasons. The vehicles were in Purple Livery."
