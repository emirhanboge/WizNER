    "text": "Steven Leo Driehaus (born June 24, 1966) is an American politician and former &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;U.S. Representative&lt;/a&gt; for , serving from 2009 until 2011. A member of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, he previously served as the Minority &lt;a href=\"Whip%20%28politics%29\"&gt;Whip&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Ohio House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe district includes the western four-fifths of &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, as well as suburbs north and west of the city in &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Butler%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Butler&lt;/a&gt; counties. He was formerly a four-term member of the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Ohio House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, representing the 31st District from 2001 to 2009. His Ohio State House district included western &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; and all of &lt;a href=\"Addyston%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Addyston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheviot%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cheviot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleves%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cleves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Bend%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;North Bend, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education.\nDriehaus, a 1984 graduate and class president of &lt;a href=\"Elder%20High%20School\"&gt;Elder High School&lt;/a&gt; in Cincinnati, studied political science at &lt;a href=\"Miami%20University\"&gt;Miami University&lt;/a&gt; while earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1988. He earned a &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Public%20Administration\"&gt;Master of Public Administration&lt;/a&gt; (MPA) from &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20University%20Bloomington\"&gt;Indiana University Bloomington&lt;/a&gt; in 1995.\nCareer.\nHe served as a &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Corps\"&gt;Peace Corps&lt;/a&gt; volunteer in &lt;a href=\"Senegal\"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt; where he worked with village groups and local schools as a &lt;a href=\"natural%20resource\"&gt;natural resource&lt;/a&gt; volunteer to promote sustainable environmental practices from 1988 to 1990.\nDriehaus then served as Associate Director of the Center for International Education and Development Assistance at &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20University\"&gt;Indiana University&lt;/a&gt;. While serving in this role, he coordinated the South African Internship Program, which was sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Information%20Agency\"&gt;United States Information Agency&lt;/a&gt; that is the largest professional exchange program between the United States and &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. He formerly directed and served as consultant to the Community Building Institute, a collaborative effort of &lt;a href=\"Xavier%20University%20%28Cincinnati%29\"&gt;Xavier University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20Way%20of%20America\"&gt;United Way&lt;/a&gt; &amp; Community Chest that promotes citizen-led, asset-based community development. He is a member of the Price Hill Civic Club and serves on the Board of Seton High School. He was a part-time &lt;a href=\"political%20science\"&gt;political science&lt;/a&gt; instructor at &lt;a href=\"Xavier%20University%20%28Cincinnati%29\"&gt;Xavier University&lt;/a&gt;. He began his political career as an &lt;a href=\"Personal%20assistant\"&gt;aide&lt;/a&gt; for Cincinnati City Council Member &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Portune\"&gt;Todd Portune&lt;/a&gt; and former U.S. Rep. &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Luken\"&gt;Charlie Luken&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s.\nOhio House of Representatives.\nDriehaus served four consecutive terms. He served as Minority Whip of the Ohio House of Representatives from the beginning of his third term in January 2005 until he resigned from the position to be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Strahorn\"&gt;Fred Strahorn&lt;/a&gt; in December 2007 due to his campaign.\nDriehaus took a leadership role on issues such as election law and redistricting reform. He took issue with &lt;a href=\"information%20privacy\"&gt;information privacy&lt;/a&gt; in the state. \nU.S. House of Representatives.\nCommittee assignments.\nDriehaus has been a highly regarded politician. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cincinnati%20Enquirer\"&gt;The Cincinnati Enquirer&lt;/a&gt;\" named him legislative \"Rookie of the Year\" during his first term. In 2008, the ARC of Ohio and the Ohio Association of Election Officials named him Democratic Legislator of the Year. He had a reputation as an &lt;a href=\"anti-abortion\"&gt;anti-abortion&lt;/a&gt; fiscal &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical campaigns.\nOhio House campaigns.\nIn 2000, Driehaus ran for the Ohio House of Representatives from the 33rd district, which at the time included &lt;a href=\"Delhi%20Township%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Delhi Township&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Price%20Hill%2C%20Cincinnati\"&gt;Price Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sayler%20Park%2C%20Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Sayler Park&lt;/a&gt; and other parts of western Hamilton County.\nThe incumbent, &lt;a href=\"Jerome%20F.%20Luebbers\"&gt;Jerome Luebbers&lt;/a&gt;, had surrendered his seat due to term limits. In the 2002 redistricting, Driehaus' district became the 31st district and surrendered many Republican constituents. Driehaus has served the 31st Ohio House of Representatives district, which has included &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;wards&lt;/a&gt; 19\u201322, 25 &amp; 26 of Cincinnati as well as Cheviot, Cleves, North Bend, and Addyston since the 2002 redistricting. This district is fully contained within Ohio's 1st congressional district. It is also (along with districts 32 and 33) part of &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20Senate\"&gt;Ohio Senate&lt;/a&gt; district 9, which encompasses the south central portion of Hamilton County.\nDriehaus did not have an opponent in any of his Democratic primaries, and he earned at least 57% shares of the vote in each of his general elections for state legislature.\n2006 elections.\nDriehaus had been the choice of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Congressional%20Campaign%20Committee\"&gt;Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee&lt;/a&gt; (DCCC) to run in Ohio's 1st congressional district for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%202006\"&gt;2006 United States House of Representatives elections&lt;/a&gt;, but he decided to run for re-election in his Ohio House of Representatives seat. He had been elected as the Minority Whip of the Ohio House of Representatives, replacing &lt;a href=\"Dale%20Miller\"&gt;Dale Miller&lt;/a&gt; for the beginning of the 2005 session, in a November 2004 vote after being reelected to his third term. Driehaus survived his own challenge from Scott Gehring with a 2:1 victory margin in the 2006 election for his state house seat.\nBased on the &lt;a href=\"2000%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2004%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2004 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt;s, the district has voted 1% more Republican than the nation as a whole. The district is regarded as a Democratically shifting maturing suburban district that is expected to vote more city-like as it becomes more dense. The district was one of four Republican Ohio congressional seats that the party had targeted for takeover, but Chabot held off &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; Councilman &lt;a href=\"John%20Cranley\"&gt;John Cranley&lt;/a&gt; by a 52% to 48% margin and the Republicans held on to three of the four seats.\n2008 congressional campaign.\nAlthough Driehaus passed on the 2006 race, he began planning a run for the district in 2008 almost as soon as the 2006 election cycle ended. This was largely because he was barred from running for a fifth term in the state house. Ohio's 1st district was very high on the target list for the Democrats in both 2006 and 2008. Seven-term Republican incumbent &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Chabot\"&gt;Steve Chabot&lt;/a&gt;, elected in the Republican wave of 1994, had won the district consistently, but with varying margins. He had won the seat with less than 55% of the vote in four of his seven previous victories.\nIn previous elections, the 1st congressional district was hotly contested. It narrowly favored Democratic &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20Governor\"&gt;Ohio Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Strickland\"&gt;Ted Strickland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senator\"&gt;United States Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sherrod%20Brown\"&gt;Sherrod Brown&lt;/a&gt; in 2006; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20President\"&gt;United States President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; narrowly outpaced Democratic nominee &lt;a href=\"John%20Kerry\"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; by just 1 percentage point in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2004 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. Driehaus was recruited for the race by Democratic party officials, and he received early contributions for this race from &lt;a href=\"Nancy%20Pelosi\"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steny%20H.%20Hoyer\"&gt;Steny H. Hoyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20E.%20Clyburn\"&gt;James E. Clyburn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Van%20Hollen\"&gt;Chris Van Hollen&lt;/a&gt;, that were included in his 2007 second quarter financial filings. From the time of the first official announcement on May 3, 2007 and first financial filing deadline on July 15, 2007, the race has been closely watched in the national media, and \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;\" described it as one of the 15 Congressional races to watch in the 2008 election. The DCCC has named the district's race as one of the thirteen that it is supporting in hopes of ousting a Republican incumbent in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%202008\"&gt;2008 United States House of Representatives elections&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the midst of the &lt;a href=\"financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932010\"&gt;financial crisis of 2007\u20132010&lt;/a&gt;, especially the &lt;a href=\"subprime%20mortgage%20crisis\"&gt;subprime mortgage crisis&lt;/a&gt;, one of the issues in the race has been the candidates stances on &lt;a href=\"foreclosure\"&gt;foreclosure&lt;/a&gt;s. The race was considered to be close. As of October 14, 2008 (three weeks before election day), \"The Rothenberg Political Report\" considered the race to be a toss-up. A poll by &lt;a href=\"Survey%20USA\"&gt;Survey USA&lt;/a&gt; indicated that &lt;a href=\"African-American\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; turnout would probably determine who won the race.\nAlthough a marginally Republican district, 27 percent of the district's voters are African-American \u2014 one of the highest percentages for a Republican-held district in the 109th Congress. The district includes nearly all of Cincinnati's African-American voters. In the November 4 election, Driehaus defeated incumbent Chabot with 52 percent of the vote, largely on the strength of a 16,000-vote margin in Hamilton County. &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; carried the district with 55 percent of the vote. \n2010 congressional campaign.\nDriehaus was challenged by Republican nominee and his predecessor, former U.S. Congressman &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Chabot\"&gt;Steve Chabot&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Libertarian%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Libertarian&lt;/a&gt; nominee James Berns, and &lt;a href=\"Green%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; nominee Richard Stevenson. As Chabot was ahead in public opinion polls, the DCCC pulled its financial support for TV ads from the Driehaus campaign, indicating to NBC pundit &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Todd\"&gt;Chuck Todd&lt;/a&gt; that they expected Driehaus to be defeated, which he was, 52% to 45%. To date, he is the last Democrat to have represented Cincinnati in Congress. \nIn October 2012 Driehaus filed a criminal complaint against the &lt;a href=\"Susan%20B.%20Anthony%20List\"&gt;Susan B. Anthony List&lt;/a&gt; claiming the organization violated Ohio law against making false statements in a campaign advertisement. He later asked that the complaint be dropped. Driehaus later &lt;a href=\"Susan%20B.%20Anthony%20List%23Driehaus%20political%20ad%20litigation\"&gt;sued the List&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the group caused his \"loss of livelihood\" by \"defaming\" him by saying he supported taxpayer funded abortion due to his vote for the &lt;a href=\"Affordable%20Care%20Act\"&gt;Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt;. The case was decided in favor of the Susan B. Anthony List (Defendants) (805 F.Supp.2d 412 (2011)).\nPeace Corps.\nIn March 2011, Driehaus was selected for an approximately two and a half years tenure as the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Corps\"&gt;Peace Corps&lt;/a&gt;' director of &lt;a href=\"HIV\"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and AIDS education in &lt;a href=\"Swaziland\"&gt;Swaziland&lt;/a&gt;. This follows on his prior African Peace Corps experience as a volunteer. His wife and three children moved along with him. On June 29, 2011, he completed his staff training and was sworn in for service.\nPersonal.\nDriehaus was raised in &lt;a href=\"Green%20Township%2C%20Hamilton%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Green Township&lt;/a&gt; by H. Donald and Clare Driehaus, along with his seven siblings. He lives with his wife, Lucienne, in &lt;a href=\"Price%20Hill%2C%20Cincinnati\"&gt;Price Hill, Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;. They are congregants at St. Teresa of Avila Catholic parish. His father, Don Driehaus, is a former Hamilton County Democratic Party co-chairman.\nHe was succeeded in the Ohio House of Representatives by his sister &lt;a href=\"Denise%20Driehaus\"&gt;Denise&lt;/a&gt;. Their father died on September 21, 2008, aged 75.\nIn 2018, Driehaus launched GoodGovernmentGroup, a consulting firm based in Cincinnati."
