    "text": "Tuperssuatsiaite is a rare &lt;a href=\"clay%20mineral\"&gt;clay mineral&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Namibia\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=\"hydrate\"&gt;hydrate&lt;/a&gt;d &lt;a href=\"phyllosilicate\"&gt;phyllosilicate&lt;/a&gt; (sheet silicate) of &lt;a href=\"sodium\"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiscovery.\nTuperssuatsiaite was first found by Karup-Moller and Petersen in Greenland, in 1984, and given the &lt;a href=\"International%20Mineralogical%20Association\"&gt;International Mineralogical Association&lt;/a&gt; designation IMA1984-002. It was later named after the type locality, Tuperssuatsiat Bay, &lt;a href=\"Ilimaussaq%20intrusive%20complex\"&gt;Ilimaussaq&lt;/a&gt;, Greenland. In 1992 Karup-Moller and Petersen, together with von Knorring and Leonardsen, found more specimens from a second find in the &lt;a href=\"Windhoek\"&gt;Aris Quarry&lt;/a&gt; in Namibia, that allowed a better definition of the properties and composition of the mineral. Later still, in 2005, more material was found by a group of researchers from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo\"&gt;University of S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt; at the Bortolan Quarry, &lt;a href=\"Pocos%20de%20Caldas\"&gt;Pocos de Caldas&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil, and although the crystals were small, accurate determinations were made of their physical and optical properties, which differed slightly from those of the specimens from Greenland and Namibia.\nMineral group.\nTuperssuatsiaite is a member of the &lt;a href=\"palygorskite\"&gt;palygorskite&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"sepiolite\"&gt;sepiolite&lt;/a&gt; group, palygorskite subgroup.\nSubgroup members (formulae according to the IMA): \n&lt;a href=\"Iron\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; occurs both in the &lt;a href=\"ferric\"&gt;ferric&lt;/a&gt; state Fe3+ and the &lt;a href=\"ferrous\"&gt;ferrous&lt;/a&gt; state Fe2+. The formula for tuperssuatsiaite contains only ferric iron, and the Greenland material is consistent with this. Analysis of the Namibian material, however, shows that part of the iron is in the ferrous state. &lt;a href=\"Manganese\"&gt;Manganese&lt;/a&gt; is also present as a substitute for iron, and a &lt;a href=\"zinc\"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;-rich material has been reported from Greenland.\nStructure.\nThe mineral belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Monoclinic%20crystal%20system\"&gt;monoclinic crystal class&lt;/a&gt; 2/m, meaning that it has a twofold axis of &lt;a href=\"rotational%20symmetry\"&gt;rotational symmetry&lt;/a&gt; perpendicular to a &lt;a href=\"reflection%20symmetry\"&gt;mirror plane&lt;/a&gt;. At one time it was thought that the material from Namibia might belong to the monoclinic class 2, without the mirror plane, but a more recent study gives it as 2/m, the same as the material from Greenland.\nThe &lt;a href=\"space%20group\"&gt;space group&lt;/a&gt; is B2/m, meaning that in the &lt;a href=\"unit%20cell\"&gt;unit cell&lt;/a&gt; there is one structural unit at each vertex, and one in the centre of each B face. The palygorskite-sepiolite minerals are clay minerals with a layered structure. In tuperssuatsiaite ribbons of SiO4 &lt;a href=\"Tetrahedron\"&gt;tetrahedra&lt;/a&gt;, similar to those in the &lt;a href=\"amphibole\"&gt;amphibole&lt;/a&gt; structure, are aligned parallel to the c &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20structure\"&gt;crystal axis&lt;/a&gt;, and they link to form layers parallel to the plane containing the a and b axes. The spacing between the layers, in the c direction, is about 5\u00a0&lt;a href=\"angstrom\"&gt;\u00c5&lt;/a&gt;, which is typical for minerals with an amphibole-type structure, due to the repeat distance along the chains of tetrahedra. Channels occur that could be occupied by as in &lt;a href=\"palygorskite\"&gt;palygorskite&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnit cell.\nThere are two formula units per &lt;a href=\"unit%20cell\"&gt;unit cell&lt;/a&gt; (Z = 2), and the cell dimensions vary slightly for specimens from different locations; for all specimens, to the nearest \u00c5, a = 14\u00a0\u00c5, b = 18\u00a0\u00c5 and c = 5\u00a0\u00c5, and the angle \u03b2 = 103\u00b0 to 105\u00b0.\nFor the three main localities the reported values are:\nAppearance.\nTuperssuatsiaite occurs as fan-shaped aggregates up to several centimeters across, as rosettes and as fibers elongated parallel to the c axis. It is red-brown in reflected light, and colorless to light yellowish brown in transmitted light, with a brownish yellow &lt;a href=\"Streak%20%28mineralogy%29\"&gt;streak&lt;/a&gt;. Crystals are transparent with a bright vitreous &lt;a href=\"Lustre%20%28mineralogy%29\"&gt;luster&lt;/a&gt;, but aggregates may be dull and translucent.\nOptical properties.\nThe mineral is &lt;a href=\"Birefringence\"&gt;biaxial&lt;/a&gt; (+), with &lt;a href=\"Refractive%20index\"&gt;refractive indices&lt;/a&gt; Nx ~ 1.54, Ny ~ 1.56 and Nz ~ 1.58 to 1.60.\nFor the three main localities the reported values are:\nIt is mildly &lt;a href=\"Pleochroism\"&gt;pleochroic&lt;/a&gt;, with X colorless, Y colorless to pale brown or green and Z generally reddish brown. No &lt;a href=\"fluorescence\"&gt;fluorescence&lt;/a&gt; has been observed.\nPhysical properties.\n&lt;a href=\"Cleavage%20%28mineralogy%29\"&gt;Cleavage&lt;/a&gt; is good on a plane containing the b and c &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20structure\"&gt;crystal axes&lt;/a&gt;, parallel to the layers within the structure, and &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20twinning\"&gt;twinning&lt;/a&gt; is common.\n&lt;a href=\"Fracture%20%28mineralogy%29\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt; is uneven to conchoidal (shell-like) and the mineral is brittle; it is quite light, with &lt;a href=\"specific%20gravity\"&gt;specific gravity&lt;/a&gt; 2.465, which is similar to that of &lt;a href=\"quartz\"&gt;quartz&lt;/a&gt;.\nType locality.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Type%20locality%20%28geology%29\"&gt;type locality&lt;/a&gt; is Tuperssuatsiat Bay, Tunugdliarfik Firth (Eriksfjord), Ilimaussaq complex, Narsaq, Kitaa (West Greenland) Province, Greenland, and &lt;a href=\"Type%20specimen%20%28mineralogy%29\"&gt;type material&lt;/a&gt; is conserved at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Copenhagen\"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, Copenhagen, Denmark, and at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History\"&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;, Washington DC, US, reference number 162402."
