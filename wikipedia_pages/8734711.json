    "text": "Anne Viensouk Keothavong Bretherton (n\u00e9e Keothavong; born 16 September 1983) is a retired British &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; player. During her career, she won a total of 28 titles on the &lt;a href=\"ITF%20Women%27s%20Circuit\"&gt;ITF Women's Circuit&lt;/a&gt;, and reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 48 (achieved on 23 February 2009). She also reached the semifinals of six &lt;a href=\"WTA%20International%20tournaments\"&gt;WTA International tournaments&lt;/a&gt;, and the semifinals of one &lt;a href=\"WTA%20Premier%20tournaments\"&gt;Premier tournament&lt;/a&gt;. Anne was British No. 1 at the year-end rankings five times, and in 2009 became the first British player to make the &lt;a href=\"WTA%20rankings\"&gt;WTA&lt;/a&gt; top 50 since 1993. In April 2001, aged 17, she became, until &lt;a href=\"Katie%20Swan\"&gt;Katie Swan&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, the youngest player ever to play in the &lt;a href=\"Fed%20Cup\"&gt;Fed Cup&lt;/a&gt; for Great Britain, and she is second (alongside &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Baltacha\"&gt;Elena Baltacha&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Wade\"&gt;Virginia Wade&lt;/a&gt;'s record for most Fed Cup ties played for Great Britain with 39.\nKeothavong announced her retirement on 24 July 2013. After that, she became a member of &lt;a href=\"BT%20Sport\"&gt;BT Sport&lt;/a&gt;'s tennis coverage team, alongside &lt;a href=\"Martina%20Navratilova\"&gt;Martina Navratilova&lt;/a&gt; and fellow British ex-number one &lt;a href=\"Samantha%20Smith%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;Sam Smith&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, Keothavong became Fed Cup captain for Great Britain, leading the team to win all four ties played in the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Fed%20Cup%23Europe/Africa_Zone\"&gt;Europe/Africa Zone Group I&lt;/a&gt;. She continued as captain for the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Fed%20Cup\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2019%20Fed%20Cup\"&gt;2019 Fed Cup&lt;/a&gt;, winning promotion in April 2019 to World Group II for the first time in 26 years.\nPersonal life.\nAnne Keothavong was born in &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Hackney\"&gt;Hackney&lt;/a&gt; in London, to parents who had fled from their wartorn home country of &lt;a href=\"Laos\"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s. Her father, Somsak, encouraged her to play &lt;a href=\"short%20tennis\"&gt;short tennis&lt;/a&gt; from an early age. Her mother's name is Vathana and she has two brothers: James, who is a &lt;a href=\"Official%20%28tennis%29%23Chair%20umpire\"&gt;tennis umpire&lt;/a&gt;, and Mark. She also has a sister, Lena. Keothavong married Andrew Bretherton on 28 February 2015.\nKeothavong attended &lt;a href=\"Kingsland%20Secondary%20School\"&gt;Kingsland Secondary School&lt;/a&gt; in Hackney. At the age of seven, she took up tennis at &lt;a href=\"Hackney%20Downs\"&gt;Hackney Downs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Highbury%20Fields\"&gt;Highbury Fields&lt;/a&gt;. Her preferred surface was hardcourt.\nCareer.\nJunior (1996\u20132001).\nKeothavong played her first match on the &lt;a href=\"ITF%20Junior%20Circuit\"&gt;ITF Junior Circuit&lt;/a&gt; in February 1996, at age 12, and her last in August 2001. In singles, she won one title at the LTA Junior International Tournament \u2013 Bisham Abbey where she beat compatriot &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Baltacha\"&gt;Elena Baltacha&lt;/a&gt; in the final. She also reached a total of three semifinals (one of which was at the &lt;a href=\"2001%20Wimbledon%20Championships%23Juniors\"&gt;2001 Wimbledon Championships&lt;/a&gt; where she was beaten by &lt;a href=\"Dinara%20Safina\"&gt;Dinara Safina&lt;/a&gt;, the future world number one, who like Anne, went on to reach a higher ranking in seniors than in juniors) and ten quarterfinals.\nIn junior doubles, she won one tournament, the 13th Salik Open, and lost in the final of two others: the LTA International Junior Tournament \u2013 Bisham Abbey and the 11th Malaysian International Junior Championships. All three of these were in 1999 and all three were partnering Elena Baltacha.\n1998\u20132001.\nKeothavong played her first professional match on the &lt;a href=\"ITF%20Women%27s%20Circuit\"&gt;ITF Women's Circuit&lt;/a&gt; in April 1998, at age 14, when she fell in the first round of qualifying for a $10k tournament in Birmingham. That year she played only two more matches (in the qualifying tournaments for $10k events in Hatfield, Hertfordshire and Felixstowe) and lost both of them. She finished the year without a world ranking.\nDuring May 1999, Keothavong played in a total of five ITF tournaments with her best result being in the $10k event in Sunderland where she won three matches to qualify and then reached the second round. In the other four events, she either lost in the first round or qualifying stages. Her final ranking of the year was world No. 702.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2000%20WTA%20Tour\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, Keothavong played ten ITF events, losing in the qualifying stages in one, round one in three others, the second round four times (once as a &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20loser%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;lucky loser&lt;/a&gt;) and the quarterfinal in the $50k tournament in Cardiff. The other tournament she entered was the qualifying event for &lt;a href=\"2000%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; in which she participated courtesy of a &lt;a href=\"Wild%20card%20%28sports%29\"&gt;wild card&lt;/a&gt;. She beat Eva Martincov\u00e1 in round one of qualifying before losing to Yuka Yoshida. She improved her ranking to world No. 377.\n&lt;a href=\"2001%20WTA%20Tour\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; started well for Keothavong; in her first tournament of the year she won the title by beating compatriot &lt;a href=\"Emily%20Webley-Smith\"&gt;Emily Webley-Smith&lt;/a&gt; in the quarterfinals and Elodie Le Bescond in the final. She then reached the quarterfinals of her next tournament, the $10k event in Tipton. In February, she reached the semifinals in Sutton, London ($25k) as a qualifier. She played in the &lt;a href=\"2001%20Fed%20Cup\"&gt;Fed Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in April and lost all three of her singles rubbers in straight sets. In June she was given wild cards into the qualifying draws for the &lt;a href=\"DFS%20Classic\"&gt;DFS Classic&lt;/a&gt; (where she was beaten in the first round of qualifying) and the &lt;a href=\"Aegon%20International\"&gt;Britannic Asset Management International Championships&lt;/a&gt; (where she reached the second round of qualifying) and the main draw of &lt;a href=\"2001%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt;. She faced &lt;a href=\"Janet%20Lee\"&gt;Janet Lee&lt;/a&gt; in round one and lost. In September and October, she reached three ITF quarterfinals (one $50k, one $25k and one $10k) and one semifinal ($25k). Her world ranking at the end of 2001 was No. 268.\n2002.\nShe started slowly the new season; she played in 13 ITF tournaments and did not pass the second round in any. In June, she was given a wildcard into the qualifying draw for the DFS Classic where she lost in round one. She also attempted to qualify for the Britannic Asset Management International Championships and was again beaten in the first round. She next competed in the main draw of &lt;a href=\"2002%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; where in the first round, she lost to &lt;a href=\"Virginie%20Razzano\"&gt;Virginie Razzano&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately after Wimbledon she headed to Felixstowe to participate in a $25k tournament where she reached the quarterfinals. In August and September, she reached four consecutive ITF finals, winning three. She won the first in Bath beating Hannah Collin in the final. She was victorious in London when she defeated Yvonne Doyle but lost in the third final in Glasgow to &lt;a href=\"Selima%20Sfar\"&gt;Selima Sfar&lt;/a&gt;. In Sunderland, her fourth consecutive final of August and September, she won by again beating Hannah Collin. She competed in three more $25k tournaments that year and reached the semifinals in two of them. Her final ranking of 2002 was world No. 233.\n2003.\nThe first tournament of &lt;a href=\"2003%20WTA%20Tour\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; for her was the qualifying event for the &lt;a href=\"Moorilla%20Hobart%20International\"&gt;Hobart International&lt;/a&gt; where she lost to &lt;a href=\"Tiffany%20Dabek\"&gt;Tiffany Dabek&lt;/a&gt; in the first round. Keothavong then headed to the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt; in order to attempt to qualify and she again lost in the first round to &lt;a href=\"Sandra%20Kl%C3%B6sel\"&gt;Sandra Kl\u00f6sel&lt;/a&gt;. After this she headed to the ITF Circuit and won the $25k event in Belfort by defeating &lt;a href=\"Nathalie%20Vi%C3%A9rin\"&gt;Nathalie Vi\u00e9rin&lt;/a&gt; in the final. Two weeks later she reached the quarterfinals of a $25k in Redbridge, London and the week after that lost in the final of yet another $25k event in Ostrava. In March, she reached the quarterfinals of Redding, California ($25k) and in April she headed to Portugal to represent Great Britain in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Fed%20Cup\"&gt;Fed Cup&lt;/a&gt;. She won two of her four singles rubbers. May saw Keothavong reach the second round of qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"2003%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt;. In her next tournament (Surbiton $25k), she reached the semifinals but had to withdraw before the match. Keothavong did not compete again until mid-June when she was given a wild card into the main draw of the Hastings Direct International where she was defeated by Japanese veteran, &lt;a href=\"Ai%20Sugiyama\"&gt;Ai Sugiyama&lt;/a&gt;. A second consecutive wild card gave her entry into the main draw of &lt;a href=\"2003%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; where she had to withdraw during her first-round match against &lt;a href=\"Katarina%20Srebotnik\"&gt;Katarina Srebotnik&lt;/a&gt; with the score at 2\u20136, 0\u20134. After Wimbledon she reached the final round of qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"2003%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;US Open&lt;/a&gt; and lost to &lt;a href=\"Maureen%20Drake\"&gt;Maureen Drake&lt;/a&gt; but had no more notable results that year. She finished the year with a singles ranking of world No. 177.\n2004.\n&lt;a href=\"2004%20WTA%20Tour\"&gt;The season&lt;/a&gt; began well for Keothavong as she started off by qualifying for the Tier-V Hobart International, beating &lt;a href=\"Kaia%20Kanepi\"&gt;Kaia Kanepi&lt;/a&gt; along the way. In the first round she faced world No. 69, &lt;a href=\"Rita%20Grande\"&gt;Rita Grande&lt;/a&gt;, but was beaten. This was followed by an attempt to qualify for the first Grand Slam of the season, the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt;. She was beaten in the first round of qualifying by Stephanie Gehrlein. In February, she reached the quarterfinals of ITF events in Sunderland ($25k) and Saint Paul ($50k), beaten by Lisa Stanciute and &lt;a href=\"Jill%20Craybas\"&gt;Jill Craybas&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The next month she won the sixth ITF title of her career by beating &lt;a href=\"Mashona%20Washington\"&gt;Mashona Washington&lt;/a&gt; in the final of the $25k event in Redding. In late April and early May, she represented Britain in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Fed%20Cup\"&gt;Fed Cup&lt;/a&gt; and won all three of her singles rubbers, but lost her one and only doubles match with partner, Elena Baltacha, before going on to lose in the first round of qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"2004%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kv%C4%9Bta%20Peschke\"&gt;Kv\u011bta Peschke&lt;/a&gt;. In the run up to Wimbledon, Keothavong was given a wild card into the main draw of the DFS Classic where in the first round she faced world No. 60, &lt;a href=\"Marta%20Marrero\"&gt;Marta Marrero&lt;/a&gt;, who she managed to beat in three sets. Keothavong came up against world No. 56, &lt;a href=\"Mar%C3%ADa%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Lorenzo\"&gt;Mar\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Lorenzo&lt;/a&gt; (the 16th seed) in the second round and lost in three sets. She headed to the main draw of the Hastings International Direct, a &lt;a href=\"WTA%20Tier%20II%20Events\"&gt;Tier-II event&lt;/a&gt; after whis and faced No. 8 seed, &lt;a href=\"Magdalena%20Maleeva\"&gt;Magdalena Maleeva&lt;/a&gt;, and was again beaten in three sets. A wildcard granted Keothavong entry to the main draw of Wimbledon for the fourth consecutive year where she won her first-round match, beating Nicole Pratt, the world No. 41, in a performance assisted by a rain delay when Keothavong was 3\u20131 down in the first set. The eventual champion Maria Sharapova beat her in the second round. After Wimbledon, Keothavong played in two $50k events in the United States reaching the second round in one and the quarterfinals in the second, in Lexington, Kentucky where she had to withdraw due to sustaining serious ligament damage with the score at 5\u20137, 3\u20135. She did not play again that year and finished with a ranking of world No. 175.\n2005.\nKeothavong recovered well from her injury and returned to action ahead of schedule in March at the $10k tournament in Sunderland where she suffered a three-set first-round defeat by &lt;a href=\"Verdiana%20Verardi\"&gt;Verdiana Verardi&lt;/a&gt;. She then immediately reached three successive $10k finals; the first in Bolton and the second two in Bath. She won the first two by beating Veronika Chvojkov\u00e1 and Claire Peterzan respectively and lost the third to compatriot, &lt;a href=\"Melanie%20South\"&gt;Melanie South&lt;/a&gt;. The first of the two tournaments in Bath was also the only time Keothavong competed with her sister Lena in doubles on the ITF Circuit. They reached the quarterfinals together. In late April, Keothavong competed in the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Fed%20Cup\"&gt;Fed Cup&lt;/a&gt; and helped Britain avoid relegation from the Africa/Europe Zone Group I by beating &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20Wozniacki\"&gt;Caroline Wozniacki&lt;/a&gt; to help Britain beat &lt;a href=\"Denmark%20Fed%20Cup%20team\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;. This meant that although they lost ties against &lt;a href=\"Serbia%20Fed%20Cup%20team\"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slovenia%20Fed%20Cup%20team\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, they avoided a place in the relegation play-offs for another year. In May, she reached the semifinals of a $25k event in Monz\u00f3n where she lost to &lt;a href=\"Angelique%20Kerber\"&gt;Angelique Kerber&lt;/a&gt;. She was then given a wildcard into the main draw of the DFS Classic where she lost to &lt;a href=\"Laura%20Granville\"&gt;Laura Granville&lt;/a&gt; in the first round. This was followed by a wild card into the Hastings Direct International qualifying tournament where &lt;a href=\"Arantxa%20Parra%20Santonja\"&gt;Arantxa Parra Santonja&lt;/a&gt; defeated her in the first round. After this, another wildcard allowed Keothavong entry into the main draw of the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Wimbledon Championships&lt;/a&gt; where she faced &lt;a href=\"Mariana%20D%C3%ADaz%20Oliva\"&gt;Mariana D\u00edaz Oliva&lt;/a&gt; in the first round and lost in straight sets.\nAfter Wimbledon, Keothavong competed on the ITF Circuit for the rest of the year (except when she reached the second round of the &lt;a href=\"WTA%20Tier%20III%20Events\"&gt;Tier-III event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Challenge\"&gt;Bell Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, where she lost to &lt;a href=\"Sofia%20Arvidsson\"&gt;Sofia Arvidsson&lt;/a&gt;) and won two more titles. The first was in Nottingham, a $10k event, where she beat &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Paterson\"&gt;Karen Paterson&lt;/a&gt; in a three-set final and the second was a $25k tournament in Lagos where she defeated &lt;a href=\"Ma%C5%A1a%20Zec%20Pe%C5%A1kiri%C4%8D\"&gt;Ma\u0161a Zec Pe\u0161kiri\u010d&lt;/a&gt; to win the title. She also reached one more $25k final this year, also in Lagos, where she lost to &lt;a href=\"Petra%20Cetkovsk%C3%A1\"&gt;Petra Cetkovsk\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; in three sets. Her year-end ranking for 2005 was world No. 239.\n2006.\nKeothavong started her &lt;a href=\"2006%20WTA%20Tour\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; season by losing in the first round of qualifying for the Brisbane International (Tier III), the final round of qualifying for the Hobart International and the second round of qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt;. In February, Keothavong returned to Britain and reached the final of the &lt;a href=\"2006%20ITF%20Women%27s%20Circuit\"&gt;ITF&lt;/a&gt; tournament in Jersey where she beat &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Vrlji%C4%87\"&gt;Ana Vrlji\u0107&lt;/a&gt; to win the title. She then entered the $25k tournament in Sunderland where she beat four compatriots; Melanie South, &lt;a href=\"Rebecca%20Llewellyn\"&gt;Rebecca Llewellyn&lt;/a&gt;, Sarah Coles and &lt;a href=\"Katie%20O%27Brien\"&gt;Katie O'Brien&lt;/a&gt; in straight sets to reach the final where she was beaten by Elise Tama\u00ebla. Later in February, Keothavong reached the quarterfinals of an ITF tournament in Orange, California ($25k) and one month later, in March, she reached another ITF final, again $25k. In April, she reached the semifinals of the $25k event in &lt;a href=\"Patras\"&gt;Patras&lt;/a&gt; and competed for Great Britain in the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Fed%20Cup\"&gt;Fed Cup&lt;/a&gt; where she won one of her three singles rubbers. She qualified for the &lt;a href=\"Internationaux%20de%20Strasbourg\"&gt;Internationaux de Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt;, a Tier-III tournament, where she lost to &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Smashnova\"&gt;Anna Smashnova&lt;/a&gt; in the first round.\nKeothavong competed in four tournaments in June: a $25k event in Surbiton, the DFS Classic, the Hastings Direct Championships and &lt;a href=\"2006%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt;. She was beaten by Laura Granville in the semifinals, &lt;a href=\"Eleni%20Daniilidou\"&gt;Eleni Daniilidou&lt;/a&gt; in round one, &lt;a href=\"Vera%20Dushevina\"&gt;Vera Dushevina&lt;/a&gt; in the first round and &lt;a href=\"Karolina%20%C5%A0prem\"&gt;Karolina \u0160prem&lt;/a&gt; in the first round respectively. During her American hard-court season, she reached the quarterfinals of a $50k tournament in Lexington where she fell to &lt;a href=\"Camille%20Pin\"&gt;Camille Pin&lt;/a&gt; of France. In August, Keothavong lost in the first round of qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"2006%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;US Open&lt;/a&gt; and followed this up with three consecutive first-round losses in WTA events. She then returned to the ITF Circuit playing $25k tournaments and won one more title, in P\u0159erov. She also reached two semifinals (Glasgow and Opole) and a quarterfinal in Jersey. She ended the season with her world ranking at No. 168.\n2007.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2007%20WTA%20Tour\"&gt;new season&lt;/a&gt; began in the same way as the 2006 for Keothavong; she again started her year by falling in qualifying for the WTA events in the Moorilla Hobart International and the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt;. In February she reached two consecutive &lt;a href=\"2007%20ITF%20Women%27s%20Circuit\"&gt;ITF&lt;/a&gt; semifinals in Tipton ($25k) and St. Paul ($50k) before going on to lose in qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20Morgan%20Keegan%20Championships%20and%20the%20Cellular%20South%20Cup\"&gt;Cellular South Cup&lt;/a&gt; and in qualifying for &lt;a href=\"2007%20Pacific%20Life%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Indian Wells&lt;/a&gt; in March.

In May she reached the semifinals of an $25k in Antalya and lost in the second round of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt; qualifying tournament to &lt;a href=\"Mar%C3%ADa%20Emilia%20Salerni\"&gt;Mar\u00eda Emilia Salerni&lt;/a&gt;. As in 2006, June saw Keothavong lose in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20DFS%20Classic\"&gt;DFS Classic&lt;/a&gt;, the Hastings Direct International and &lt;a href=\"2007%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; after she was given a wildcard into each of these events. Elena Baltacha was her conqueror in the Hastings Direct whereas &lt;a href=\"Jelena%20Jankovi%C4%87\"&gt;Jelena Jankovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; was the victor over Keothavong in Wimbledon.\nAfter Wimbledon, Keothavong reached two consecutive finals of $50k events in Lexington and Vancouver, facing &lt;a href=\"St%C3%A9phanie%20Dubois\"&gt;St\u00e9phanie Dubois&lt;/a&gt; in the finals of both and winning once. Following this she lost in qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Rogers%20Cup%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Rogers Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"2007%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;US Open&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2007%20Commonwealth%20Bank%20Tennis%20Classic%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; before going on to reach her first ever WTA Tour semifinal in the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Sunfeast%20Open\"&gt;Sunfeast Open&lt;/a&gt;, a Tier-III tournament held in Kolkata. She did this by defeating &lt;a href=\"Sara%20Errani\"&gt;Sara Errani&lt;/a&gt; in the first round, &lt;a href=\"Sunitha%20Rao\"&gt;Sunitha Rao&lt;/a&gt; in round two and &lt;a href=\"Tzipi%20Obziler\"&gt;Tzipi Obziler&lt;/a&gt; in the quarterfinals. She lost to &lt;a href=\"Mariya%20Koryttseva\"&gt;Mariya Koryttseva&lt;/a&gt; in the semifinals. In October, she reached the quarterfinals of the $25k tournament in Rockhampton, Queensland and her year-ending singles ranking was world No. 122.\n2008.\nKeothavong's &lt;a href=\"2008%20WTA%20Tour\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; campaign began when Keothavong failed to qualify for the Tier-II tournament, the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Medibank%20International%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Medibank International&lt;/a&gt;. She then attempted to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt; and won her first match against &lt;a href=\"Jorgelina%20Cravero\"&gt;Jorgelina Cravero&lt;/a&gt; before losing her second to &lt;a href=\"Monica%20Niculescu\"&gt;Monica Niculescu&lt;/a&gt;. February saw her join compatriots, Melanie South, Katie O'Brien and Elena Baltacha, to represent Britain in the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Fed%20Cup\"&gt;Fed Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Keothavong winning each of her three singles matches in the round robin stage, Britain was forced to fight relegation from the Europe/Africa Group I by playing &lt;a href=\"Portugal%20Fed%20Cup%20team\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. They won 2\u20130 thanks to yet another victory in singles from Keothavong and a singles victory from O'Brien. For the remainder of February, Keothavong competed on the &lt;a href=\"2008%20ITF%20Women%27s%20Circuit\"&gt;ITF circuit&lt;/a&gt; and reached the quarterfinals of a $25k event in Stockholm and won a $25k title in Capriolo. In early April, she lost in the final of a $50k tournament; this one in Patras where &lt;a href=\"Magdal%C3%A9na%20Ryb%C3%A1rikov%C3%A1\"&gt;Magdal\u00e9na Ryb\u00e1rikov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; defeated her in straight sets. Continuing competition on the ITF Circuit, she won a $50k tournament in Jounieh, Lebanon (despite break outs of fighting between &lt;a href=\"Shia\"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hezbollah\"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; militia less than ten miles away in Beirut). This tournament win propelled Keothavong into the top 100 for the first time in her career and guaranteed her a place in the main draw of Wimbledon for the first time in her career; the first time a British woman had entered Wimbledon on merit since 1999. She then fell in the first round of qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"2008%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt; before reaching another $50k final (in Surbiton).\nIn the run up to Wimbledon, Keothavong lost in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20DFS%20Classic%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;DFS Classic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kateryna%20Bondarenko\"&gt;Kateryna Bondarenko&lt;/a&gt; and in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Ordina%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Ordina Open&lt;/a&gt; to Sara Errani. In her first-round match in Wimbledon, she faced American, Vania King, and lost the first set. She regrouped during a toilet break at the end of the first set and came back to win the match in three sets despite being 2\u20130 down in the deciding set. She then lost to the eventual champion, Venus Williams, in the second round. After Wimbledon, Keothavong made a successful start to her American hard-court season by winning three matches to qualify for the Tier II event in &lt;a href=\"2008%20Bank%20of%20the%20West%20Classic%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;. She then defeated &lt;a href=\"Sania%20Mirza\"&gt;Sania Mirza&lt;/a&gt; in the first round before giving &lt;a href=\"Marion%20Bartoli\"&gt;Marion Bartoli&lt;/a&gt; a tough time in round two in a match which she eventually lost in three tight sets. In August she entered the US Open for the first time in her career and faced Alexa Glatch in round one. She won the match and then went on to beat Francesca Schiavone in the second round in three sets. However No. 5 seed, Elena Dementieva, proved too much for Keothavong in the third round; Keothavong lost. After the US Open, Keothavong won two more ITF events: &lt;a href=\"Aegon%20GB%20Pro-Series%20Barnstaple\"&gt;Barnstaple&lt;/a&gt; ($50k) and Krak\u00f3w ($100k) and as a result, her year-end ranking was world No. 61.\n2009.\nKeothavong began her &lt;a href=\"2009%20WTA%20Tour\"&gt;2009 season&lt;/a&gt; by launching her official website before heading to the &lt;a href=\"2009%20ASB%20Classic%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;ASB Classic&lt;/a&gt; where she reached the semifinals. En route, she defeated &lt;a href=\"Mirjana%20Lu%C4%8Di%C4%87\"&gt;Mirjana Lu\u010di\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, No. 8 seed &lt;a href=\"Carla%20Su%C3%A1rez%20Navarro\"&gt;Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayumi%20Morita\"&gt;Ayumi Morita&lt;/a&gt; before falling in a three-hour, three set battle to &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Vesnina\"&gt;Elena Vesnina&lt;/a&gt;. This was only the second time in her career that she reached the semifinals of a WTA Tour event. Keothavong then competed in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Moorilla%20Hobart%20International%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;Hobart International&lt;/a&gt; where she faced a tough draw in round one against world No. 25, &lt;a href=\"%C3%81gnes%20Sz%C3%A1vay\"&gt;\u00c1gnes Sz\u00e1vay&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, Keothavong came through without too much difficulty, beating Sz\u00e1vay in two sets. She lost to &lt;a href=\"Virginie%20Razzano\"&gt;Virginie Razzano&lt;/a&gt; in the second round. Keothavong then headed to the main draw of the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in her career where she came up against &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Chakvetadze\"&gt;Anna Chakvetadze&lt;/a&gt;, who was the 17th seed. She lost in a controversial match where a mistake by the umpire allowed Chakvetadze to serve first in the final set, an advantage which should have gone to Keothavong. Keothavong was the fourth seed in her next tournament, the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Cellular%20South%20Cup%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;Cellular South Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and she followed up on this seeding by reaching the semifinals of a WTA event for the second time in 2009. She defeated &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Elena%20Camerin\"&gt;Maria Elena Camerin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Larcher%20de%20Brito\"&gt;Michelle Larcher de Brito&lt;/a&gt; and No. 5 seed &lt;a href=\"Marina%20Erakovic\"&gt;Marina Erakovic&lt;/a&gt; on the way to being demolished by top seed Caroline Wozniacki in the semifinals. Despite this crushing defeat, a semifinal run was enough to help Keothavong make the hop from world No. 52 to world No. 48, her debut in the top 50. Keothavong then endured three consecutive first round defeats in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20BNP%20Paribas%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;BNP Paribas Open&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Sony%20Ericsson%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Sony Ericsson Open&lt;/a&gt; (both &lt;a href=\"WTA%20Premier%20tournaments\"&gt;Premier Mandatory tournaments&lt;/a&gt;) and a $100k &lt;a href=\"2009%20ITF%20Women%27s%20Circuit\"&gt;ITF&lt;/a&gt; tournament in Tourhout, Belgium, where she was forced to retire due to a viral illness.\nFollowing this, Keothavong began her &lt;a href=\"clay%20court\"&gt;clay court&lt;/a&gt; season by defeating &lt;a href=\"Maret%20Ani\"&gt;Maret Ani&lt;/a&gt; to reach the second round of the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Grand%20Prix%20SAR%20La%20Princesse%20Lalla%20Meryem%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;Grand Prix in Fes, Morocco&lt;/a&gt; where she was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Lourdes%20Dom%C3%ADnguez%20Lino\"&gt;Lourdes Dom\u00ednguez Lino&lt;/a&gt;. This was followed by another first-round defeat in a Premier event in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Internazionali%20BNL%20d%27Italia%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Italian Open&lt;/a&gt;, this one at the hands of Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro. In the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Mutua%20Madrile%C3%B1a%20Madrid%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Madrid Open&lt;/a&gt;, she beat &lt;a href=\"Mariana%20Duque%20Marino\"&gt;Mariana Duque Marino&lt;/a&gt; in round one before losing to &lt;a href=\"Lucie%20%C5%A0af%C3%A1%C5%99ov%C3%A1\"&gt;Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; in the second round. In her very next tournament, she reached the fourth WTA Tour semifinal of her career and her third in 2009 in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Warsaw%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;Warsaw Open&lt;/a&gt;. She faced No. 7 seed, &lt;a href=\"Bethanie%20Mattek-Sands\"&gt;Bethanie Mattek-Sands&lt;/a&gt;, in round one, American veteran &lt;a href=\"Jill%20Craybas\"&gt;Jill Craybas&lt;/a&gt; in the second round, qualifier &lt;a href=\"Ioana%20Raluca%20Olaru\"&gt;Ioana Raluca Olaru&lt;/a&gt; in the quarterfinals and was beaten by eighth seed &lt;a href=\"Alona%20Bondarenko\"&gt;Alona Bondarenko&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, in reaching the semifinals she became the first British woman to reach the semifinals of a WTA clay-court event since &lt;a href=\"Jo%20Durie\"&gt;Jo Durie&lt;/a&gt; reached the semifinals of the &lt;a href=\"1983%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;1983 French Open&lt;/a&gt;, 26 years before. She then came up against reigning &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20WTA%20number%201%20ranked%20players\"&gt;world No. 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dinara%20Safina\"&gt;Dinara Safina&lt;/a&gt;, in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2009%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt; and endured the dreaded \"double bagel\" when she was defeated, 0\u20136, 0\u20136. Keothavong began her &lt;a href=\"grass%20court\"&gt;grass court&lt;/a&gt; season on home turf with a victory over Sofia Arvidsson in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Aegon%20Classic%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;Aegon Classic&lt;/a&gt; before losing to eventual semifinalist, &lt;a href=\"Sania%20Mirza\"&gt;Sania Mirza&lt;/a&gt;, in round two. She was then defeated in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Aegon%20International%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Aegon International&lt;/a&gt; by world No. 28, &lt;a href=\"Sybille%20Bammer\"&gt;Sybille Bammer&lt;/a&gt;, but saw off a mugger in central London who tried to snatch her handbag before heading to &lt;a href=\"2009%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt;, where she experienced a first round loss to world No. 80, &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Mayr\"&gt;Patricia Mayr&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this, Keothavong played the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20the%20West%20Classic\"&gt;Bank of the West Classic&lt;/a&gt; in Stanford, California where she lost in the opening round of the singles to &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Dementieva\"&gt;Elena Dementieva&lt;/a&gt;. Keothavong also played in the doubles with &lt;a href=\"Ayumi%20Morita\"&gt;Ayumi Morita&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Julie%20Coin\"&gt;Julie Coin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marie-%C3%88ve%20Pelletier\"&gt;Marie-\u00c8ve Pelletier&lt;/a&gt;, trailing 4\u20136, 5\u20133 when she attempted to run down a &lt;a href=\"drop%20shot\"&gt;drop shot&lt;/a&gt; and, in trying to avoid a collision with the net post, suffered a serious knee injury, rupturing her left &lt;a href=\"anterior%20cruciate%20ligament\"&gt;anterior cruciate ligament&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meniscus%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;meniscus&lt;/a&gt;, a similar injury to the one she suffered in 2004 in her right knee. This injury ended Keothavong's year and as a result, her year-end ranking dropped to world No. 84.\n2010.\nAfter six months out of action due to her knee injury, Keothavong returned to competitive action in February &lt;a href=\"2010%20WTA%20Tour\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Fed%20Cup\"&gt;Fed Cup&lt;/a&gt;. She faced Patricia Mayr of &lt;a href=\"Austria%20Fed%20Cup%20team\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; in her first match back and was beaten in straight sets. She partnered &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Borwell\"&gt;Sarah Borwell&lt;/a&gt; to take on Mayr and &lt;a href=\"Yvonne%20Meusburger\"&gt;Yvonne Meusburger&lt;/a&gt; in the doubles and again lost in straight sets. However Keothavong did manage to claim victory in her other two singles ties against players from &lt;a href=\"Belarus%20Fed%20Cup%20team\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20Fed%20Cup%20team\"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeothavong then returned to the tour at the &lt;a href=\"Dow%20Corning%20Tennis%20Classic\"&gt;Dow Corning Tennis Classic&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan in the 100k event. She battled past &lt;a href=\"Ivana%20Lisjak\"&gt;Ivana Lisjak&lt;/a&gt; in three sets before only dropping two games in a drubbing of Daniilidou. She then faced &lt;a href=\"Marta%20Domachowska\"&gt;Marta Domachowska&lt;/a&gt; and went down in three sets after she won the first.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20Morgan%20Keegan%20Championships%20and%20the%20Cellular%20South%20Cup\"&gt;Cellular South Cup in Memphis&lt;/a&gt;, Keothavong reached the semifinals, on her return to the main tour. By defeating &lt;a href=\"Kristina%20Barrois\"&gt;Kristina Barrois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Larcher%20de%20Brito\"&gt;Michelle Larcher de Brito&lt;/a&gt;, and Karolina \u0160prem in three impressive wins, all in straight sets. She then fell in three sets to Sofia Arvidsson in the semifinals, after battling back from a set down lost she lost the decider.\nKeothavong then competed in two &lt;a href=\"WTA%20Premier%20tournaments\"&gt;Premier tournaments&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"BNP%20Paribas%20Open\"&gt;BNP Paribas Open&lt;/a&gt; in Indian Wells and &lt;a href=\"Sony%20Ericsson%20Open\"&gt;Sony Ericsson Open&lt;/a&gt; in Miami. Keothavong crashed out in round one in both tournaments. To Anna Chakvetadze of Russia in three sets, after winning the first to continue her losing record against her in Indian Wells. And under sad circumstances in Miami, as she lost in straight sets to &lt;a href=\"Tamira%20Paszek\"&gt;Tamira Paszek&lt;/a&gt; and said afterwards \"Frankly tennis didn\u2019t seem that important today\" after receiving news before the match that her grandmother had died.\nLess than a week after her loss in Miami, Keothavong bounced back in a 75k event in Monz\u00f3n, Spain. She reached the quarterfinals after beating two Asian players, &lt;a href=\"Yurika%20Sema\"&gt;Yurika Sema&lt;/a&gt; in straight sets and &lt;a href=\"Tamarine%20Tanasugarn\"&gt;Tamarine Tanasugarn&lt;/a&gt; in three after losing a tight first set. She bowed out to Maria Elena Camerin in straight sets.\nKeothavong then moved on to Torhout, Belgium for a $50k event. She made it to the semifinals after taking out Shapatava of Georgia, Ukraine's &lt;a href=\"Kristina%20Antoniychuk\"&gt;Kristina Antoniychuk&lt;/a&gt; and Canada's &lt;a href=\"Val%C3%A9rie%20T%C3%A9treault\"&gt;Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault&lt;/a&gt; in straight sets. In the semifinals she faced another Canadian, &lt;a href=\"Rebecca%20Marino\"&gt;Rebecca Marino&lt;/a&gt;, Keothavong lost.\nAt &lt;a href=\"2010%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; she was defeated in the first round by &lt;a href=\"Anastasia%20Rodionova\"&gt;Anastasia Rodionova&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeothavong entered the &lt;a href=\"2010%20BGL%20Luxembourg%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;Luxembourg Open&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20tennis%20terms%23protected%20ranking\"&gt;protected ranking&lt;/a&gt; and reached the semifinals after beating Virginie Razzano, Patty Schnyder and &lt;a href=\"Iveta%20Bene%C5%A1ov%C3%A1\"&gt;Iveta Bene\u0161ov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; but was beaten by Roberta Vinci, preventing Keothavong from making her first WTA Tour final.\nThis year, Keothavong and Laura Robson, as members of Team &lt;a href=\"Aegon%20UK\"&gt;Aegon&lt;/a&gt;, received the equivalent of \u00a348k to provide them with personal coaches plus a \u00a312k travel budget.\n2011.\nAt the beginning of the year in Australia, Keothavong reached the second round of the &lt;a href=\"2011%20ASB%20Classic\"&gt;Auckland Open&lt;/a&gt; losing to Kateryna Bondarenko, and the second round of the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Australian%20Open\"&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt;, where she qualified, losing to 30th seed &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Petkovic\"&gt;Andrea Petkovic&lt;/a&gt; in three sets.\nKeothavong then played several &lt;a href=\"2011%20ITF%20Women%27s%20Circuit\"&gt;ITF Circuit&lt;/a&gt; events with limited success. She then entered the &lt;a href=\"2011%20French%20Open\"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt; where she lost a closely fought match in the first round to &lt;a href=\"Vesna%20Dolonc\"&gt;Vesna Dolonc&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe then moved onto grass in her home country and won a round at the $100k event in Nottingham before losing to &lt;a href=\"St%C3%A9phanie%20Dubois\"&gt;St\u00e9phanie Dubois&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"2011%20Aegon%20International\"&gt;Eastbourne&lt;/a&gt;, Keothavong entered the qualifying round, defeating eighth seed &lt;a href=\"Aliz%C3%A9%20Cornet\"&gt;Aliz\u00e9 Cornet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorana%20C%C3%AErstea\"&gt;Sorana C\u00eerstea&lt;/a&gt; before losing in the final round to &lt;a href=\"Mirjana%20Lu%C4%8Di%C4%87\"&gt;Mirjana Lu\u010di\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"2011%20Wimbledon%20Championships\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt;, Keothavong defeated fellow Briton &lt;a href=\"Naomi%20Broady\"&gt;Naomi Broady&lt;/a&gt; in the first round before losing in the second round to No. 8 seed and eventual champion, &lt;a href=\"Petra%20Kvitov%C3%A1\"&gt;Petra Kvitov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeothavong had little success during the U.S. Hardcourt Series, but the majority of her successes for 2011 came during the European hard court series towards the end of the year. Keothavong qualified and reached the second round of the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Generali%20Ladies%20Linz\"&gt;Generali Ladies Linz&lt;/a&gt;, losing a close match to third seed Jelena Jankovi\u0107. Keothavong then qualified again and this time reached the semifinals of the &lt;a href=\"2011%20BGL%20Luxembourg%20Open\"&gt;Luxembourg Open&lt;/a&gt;, defeating &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Ivanovic\"&gt;Ana Ivanovic&lt;/a&gt; in straight sets along the way before losing a close match to Monica Niculescu.\nKeothavong then won back-to-back ITF events. She won the $75k event in Barnstaple, defeating Marta Domachowska in the finaland she also won the doubles event with &lt;a href=\"Eva%20Birnerov%C3%A1\"&gt;Eva Birnerov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;.

She defeated Australian wild card Emily Fanning in the first round, and followed this with a victory over Varvara Lepchenko. In the third round Keothavong lost to &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Hampton\"&gt;Jamie Hampton&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeothavong went straight into the main draw at the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Australian%20Open\"&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt;, but had to retire due to illness from her first-round match after losing the first set to &lt;a href=\"Mona%20Barthel\"&gt;Mona Barthel&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeothavong was selected for the British Fed Cup team to play in the Europe/Africa Group 1 match at Eilat, Israel on 1\u20134 February 2012. In the group stages she played singles, defeating opponents from Portugal, and Israel in the group stages but losing to the Netherlands. The team qualified for a play-off against Austria in which Keothavong beat Patricia Mayr-Achleitner and Great Britain won 2\u20130 to secure a place in the World Group II play-off to be held in April 2012.\nKeothavong lost in straight sets to &lt;a href=\"Melinda%20Czink\"&gt;Melinda Czink&lt;/a&gt; in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2012%20French%20Open\"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Wimbledon, Keothavong lost her second-round match against Sara Errani, 1\u20136, 1\u20136.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2012 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, she was knocked out in the first round by Caroline Wozniaki, and she and team-mate Elena Baltacha were also knocked out in the first round of the women's doubles.\n2013.\nKeothavong made a disappointing start to 2013, losing in the first round qualifier in the Australian Open to &lt;a href=\"Grace%20Min\"&gt;Grace Min&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, she was still named in the Fed Cup team alongside Laura Robson, Heather Watson and &lt;a href=\"Johanna%20Konta\"&gt;Johanna Konta&lt;/a&gt; to face Portugal, Hungary and Bosnia.\nKeothavong reached her first WTA final with doubles partner &lt;a href=\"Valeria%20Savinykh\"&gt;Valeria Savinykh&lt;/a&gt;, surprisingly reaching the doubles final of the Brasil Tennis Cup. They were, however, beaten by top seeds Anabel Medina Garrigues and Yaroslava Shvedova. She played her final match of her career at the Wimbledon Championships, losing in the first round to teenager &lt;a href=\"Garbi%C3%B1e%20Muguruza\"&gt;Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza&lt;/a&gt;, in straight sets.\nRetirement.\nOn 24 July 2013, she announced her retirement from professional tennis.\nIn December 2016, Keothavong was selected as the new captain for the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20Fed%20Cup%20team\"&gt;Great Britain Fed Cup team&lt;/a&gt;, replacing Judy Murray. She was involved in controversy in 2017 when &lt;a href=\"Ilie%20N%C4%83stase\"&gt;Ilie N\u0103stase&lt;/a&gt;, captain of the &lt;a href=\"Romania%20Fed%20Cup%20team\"&gt;Romania Fed Cup team&lt;/a&gt;, used obscene language towards her and the British team during a match. At the pre-match dinner the day before, Nastase asked for Keothavong's room number.\nKeothavong was appointed &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire\"&gt;Member of the Order of the British Empire&lt;/a&gt; (MBE) in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20New%20Year%20Honours\"&gt;2021 New Year Honours&lt;/a&gt; for services to tennis.\nPlaying style.\nKeothavong's greatest strength is her powerful &lt;a href=\"forehand\"&gt;forehand&lt;/a&gt; which she uses to try to dominate play from the baseline and she adds as much &lt;a href=\"topspin\"&gt;topspin&lt;/a&gt; as possible to increase the probability of the ball landing in court. As well as her forehand, she can rely on her first-&lt;a href=\"Serve%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;serve&lt;/a&gt; to get her some easy points as she often has a high first-serve percentage and usually wins the majority of points on her first-serve. She rarely has a match where she serves no &lt;a href=\"Ace%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;aces&lt;/a&gt; at all, and in her second round match at the &lt;a href=\"2008%20US%20Open%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;2008 US Open&lt;/a&gt; she served a total of seven aces."
