    "text": "Proletarian Line () was a &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; group in &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;. It emerged from the Carlos Alberto Morales Regional Committee (based in the &lt;a href=\"coffee\"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; districts) of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Colombia%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29\"&gt;Communist Party of Colombia (Marxist-Leninist)&lt;/a&gt; (PCC(ML)), which had broken away from the mother party in 1976. The leader of the group was Julio Bedoya. Linea Proletaria strived for the build-up of an 'independent political labour movement', and less focus on armed struggle than PCC(ML).\nIn 1982 the group merged into the &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Unification%20Movement%20-%20Marxist-Leninist\"&gt;Revolutionary Unification Movement - Marxist-Leninist&lt;/a&gt;."
