    "text": "Hrabri (Brave) was the &lt;a href=\"lead%20ship\"&gt;lead boat&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Hrabri-class%20submarine\"&gt;\"Hrabri\"-class submarines&lt;/a&gt;; built by the &lt;a href=\"Vickers-Armstrongs\"&gt;Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom, for the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&lt;/a&gt; (later Yugoslavia). &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;Launched&lt;/a&gt; in 1927, her design was based on the &lt;a href=\"British%20L-class%20submarine\"&gt;British L-class submarine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, and she was built using parts originally assembled for a submarine of the class that was never completed. She was armed with six bow-mounted &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tubes\"&gt;torpedo tubes&lt;/a&gt;, two guns and one &lt;a href=\"machine%20gun\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt;, and could dive to .\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, she participated in several cruises to &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; ports. During the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href=\"Axis%20Powers\"&gt;Axis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;invasion of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; in April 1941, she was captured by &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Italian forces&lt;/a&gt;. She was given the number \"N3\" but was not recommissioned, and was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20breaking\"&gt;scrapped&lt;/a&gt; later in 1941 due to her poor condition.\nDescription and construction.\nYugoslav naval policy in the &lt;a href=\"interwar%20period\"&gt;interwar period&lt;/a&gt; lacked direction until the mid-1920s. It was generally accepted by the Yugoslav government that the &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic&lt;/a&gt; coastline was effectively a sea frontier, which the naval arm was responsible for securing with the resources made available. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s, coastal &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20bomber\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; and conventional &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt; aircraft to perform this role. The &lt;a href=\"Hrabri-class%20submarine\"&gt;\"Hrabri\"-class&lt;/a&gt; submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.\n\"Hrabri\" (Brave) was built for the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&lt;/a&gt; (later Yugoslavia) by the &lt;a href=\"Vickers-Armstrongs\"&gt;Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Tyne\"&gt;River Tyne&lt;/a&gt;, in the United Kingdom. Her design was based on the &lt;a href=\"British%20L-class%20submarine\"&gt;British L-class submarine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, and she was built using parts originally assembled for HMS \"L67\", which was never completed. Like her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister submarine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20submarine%20Nebojsa\"&gt;\"Nebojsa\"&lt;/a&gt;, she had an &lt;a href=\"Length%20overall\"&gt;overall length&lt;/a&gt; of , a &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of , and a surfaced &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; of . Her surfaced &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displacement&lt;/a&gt; was or submerged, and her crew consisted of 45 officers and enlisted men. She had an operational depth of .\nFor surface running, \"Hrabri\"-class boats were powered by two &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s which were rated at that drove two &lt;a href=\"propeller%20shaft\"&gt;propeller shaft&lt;/a&gt;s. When submerged, the propellers were driven by two electric motors generating . They could reach a top speed of on the surface and using their electric motors when submerged. On the surface, the boats had a range of at .\nThe boats were armed with six bow-mounted &lt;a href=\"British%2021%20inch%20torpedo\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tubes\"&gt;torpedo tubes&lt;/a&gt;, and carried twelve torpedoes. They were also equipped with two &lt;a href=\"QF%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20IV%2C%20XII%2C%20XXII\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"deck%20gun\"&gt;deck gun&lt;/a&gt;s (one forward and one &lt;a href=\"aft\"&gt;aft&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt;), and one &lt;a href=\"machine%20gun\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt;.\nService career.\n\"Hrabri\" was &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in 1927, as the first submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which later became the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Yugoslav Navy&lt;/a&gt;. Along with \"Neboj\u0161a\", she left the Tyne in late January 1928. In company with the Yugoslav &lt;a href=\"submarine%20tender\"&gt;submarine tender&lt;/a&gt; , the two submarines arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Kotor\"&gt;Bay of Kotor&lt;/a&gt; on the southern Adriatic coast on 8 April 1928. In May and June 1929, \"Hrabri\", \"Neboj\u0161a\", \"Hvar\" and six torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser \"&lt;a href=\"SMS%20Niobe\"&gt;Dalmacija&lt;/a&gt;\" on a cruise to &lt;a href=\"Valletta\"&gt;Valletta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Colony%20of%20Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;, the Greek island of &lt;a href=\"Corfu\"&gt;Corfu&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ionian%20Sea\"&gt;Ionian Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bizerte\"&gt;Bizerte&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"French%20protectorate%20of%20Tunisia\"&gt;French protectorate of Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;. According to the British naval &lt;a href=\"attach%C3%A9\"&gt;attach\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, the ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.\nIn June and July 1930, \"Hrabri\", \"Neboj\u0161a\" and the fleet auxiliary \"Sitnica\" again cruised the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;, visiting &lt;a href=\"Alexandria\"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beirut\"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. In 1932, the British naval attach\u00e9 reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises or manoeuvres due to reduced budgets. In 1934, \"Hrabri\" again visited Valletta and also the &lt;a href=\"Kelibia\"&gt;Kelibia&lt;/a&gt; Roads off the coast of Tunisia. In August 1935, \"Hrabri\" visited Malta; this time in company with the more modern French-designed submarine &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20submarine%20Osvetnik\"&gt;\"Osvetnik\"&lt;/a&gt;. In August and September 1937, \"Hrabri\", along with the other French-made submarine &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20submarine%20Smeli\"&gt;\"Smeli\"&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"depot%20ship\"&gt;depot ship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20minelayer%20Zmaj\"&gt;\"Zmaj\"&lt;/a&gt;, visited Greece, including the port of &lt;a href=\"Piraeus\"&gt;Piraeus&lt;/a&gt;, and the islands of &lt;a href=\"Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt; and Corfu.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href=\"Axis%20Powers\"&gt;Axis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;invasion of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; began on 6 April 1941, she was located in the Bay of Kotor along with the three other submarines of the flotilla. On 10 April, \"Hrabri\" and \"Osvetnik\" received orders for an operation against the Italian enclave of &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Zara\"&gt;Zara&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dalmatia\"&gt;Dalmatia&lt;/a&gt;n coastline, but the mission did not proceed. Later during the invasion she was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"XVII%20Corps%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;XVII Corps&lt;/a&gt; at the Bay of Kotor. She was given the number \"N3\" by the Italians but was not recommissioned, and was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20breaking\"&gt;scrapped&lt;/a&gt; later that year due to her poor condition."
