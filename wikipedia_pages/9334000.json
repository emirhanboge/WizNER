    "text": "Woodcross is a residential area of &lt;a href=\"Coseley\"&gt;Coseley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20%28county%29\"&gt;West Midlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. It is set within the &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton\"&gt;City of Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt;, though the area traditionally existed within the boundaries of &lt;a href=\"Sedgley\"&gt;Sedgley&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Coseley\"&gt;Coseley&lt;/a&gt; until 1966.\nHistory.\nThe first known record of the name was in 1614, where it was recorded as \"Woodcrosse\" - likely meaning 'the cross at the wood' or 'the wooden cross'.\nPrior to 1930, Woodcross was a largely rural area which consisted of a few residential properties on the slope of Beacon Hill as well as extensive farmland. But over the next 40 years, the area was heavily developed for housing (most of which was built by Coseley UDC).\nWoodcross borders &lt;a href=\"Ettingshall\"&gt;Ettingshall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lanesfield\"&gt;Lanesfield&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Sedgley\"&gt;Sedgley&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Woodsetton\"&gt;Woodsetton&lt;/a&gt; to the south and &lt;a href=\"Coseley\"&gt;Coseley&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Roseville%2C%20West%20Midlands\"&gt;Roseville&lt;/a&gt; to the south and east.\nToday.\nNotable landmarks in Woodcross are Beacon Hill Cemetery, Manor Primary School and St Mary's Church. There is also a statue in honour of local doctor Frederick Baker, who died in 1912, that is located on the corner of Hall Lane and Gorge Road.\nWoodcross was a largely rural area until the 1930s when Coseley Urban District Council built a number of houses in and around Woodcross Lane. After the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; in 1945, the Council built many more houses, this time creating a large estate with many streets named after Coseley councillors and famous local people, including &lt;a href=\"Tipton\"&gt;Tipton&lt;/a&gt; born runner &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Holden%20%28athlete%29\"&gt;Jack Holden&lt;/a&gt;, whose name is featured on Jack Holden Avenue.\nThe 2001 Census tells us that the majority of Woodcross's population is of English ethnicity (89.4% White British), with the largest minority population being of Indian ethnicity (5.2% Asian Indian).\nWoodcross has several estate based pubs. 'The Three Crowns' on Dovedale Road, the 'Horse and Jockey' on the corner of Evans Street and Robert Wynd, and the 'Gate Hangs Well' on Hurst Road. There is also a working men's club complete with function rooms, the 'Woodcross Club' on Woodcross Lane. The 'New Spread Eagle' (formerly the 'Spread Eagle') on Meadow Lane off the Birmingham New Road was closed in 2010 and demolished in the spring of 2011 to make way for a new nursing home.\nWoodcross is served by Manor Primary School, for pupils aged 3\u201311 years. It began life in 1933, when Woodcross was still in the early stages of development, as Manor Secondary School for pupils aged 11 and above. However, the vast growth of Woodcross and nearby &lt;a href=\"Lanesfield\"&gt;Lanesfield&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the construction of the new Ettingshall Park estate, after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; led to increased pressure on places at the school, and it was replaced by Parkfield Secondary Modern School on Lawnswood Avenue, Lanesfield, in April 1962. Manor Primary School opened in its buildings in September 1962.\nThe nearest railway station is &lt;a href=\"Coseley%20railway%20station\"&gt;Coseley&lt;/a&gt; on the Wolverhampton to Birmingham line. &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20Trains\"&gt;West Midlands Trains&lt;/a&gt; services operate every 30 minutes serving all stations with additional express services towards &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20New%20Street%20railway%20station\"&gt;Birmingham New Street&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20railway%20station\"&gt;Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt;.\nBus services in Woodcross include services 81 between &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20bus%20station\"&gt;Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merry%20Hill%20Shopping%20Centre\"&gt;Merry Hill Shopping Centre&lt;/a&gt; and 223/224 between &lt;a href=\"Bilston\"&gt;Bilston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sedgley\"&gt;Sedgley&lt;/a&gt;, service 223 continuing to &lt;a href=\"Gornal%20Wood\"&gt;Gornal Wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dudley\"&gt;Dudley&lt;/a&gt;. In addition frequent buses operate along &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20New%20Road\"&gt;Birmingham New Road&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton\"&gt;Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roseville%2C%20Dudley\"&gt;Roseville&lt;/a&gt;. Services are operated by &lt;a href=\"National%20Express%20West%20Midlands\"&gt;National Express West Midlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20West%20Midlands\"&gt;Diamond Bus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Banga%20Bus\"&gt;Banga Bus&lt;/a&gt;."
