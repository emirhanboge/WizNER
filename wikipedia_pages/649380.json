    "text": "Mount Whyte is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alberta\"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Banff%20National%20Park\"&gt;Banff National Park&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Louise%2C%20Alberta\"&gt;Lake Louise&lt;/a&gt;. The mountain can be seen from the &lt;a href=\"Trans-Canada%20Highway\"&gt;Trans-Canada Highway&lt;/a&gt;, and offers views of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Ten%20Peaks\"&gt;Valley of the Ten Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Chateau%20Lake%20Louise\"&gt;Chateau Lake Louise&lt;/a&gt;. The mountain is also visible from the hiking trail that skirts the northern shore of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Agnes%20%28Alberta%29\"&gt;Lake Agnes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mountain was named in 1898 by Sir &lt;a href=\"William%20Methuen\"&gt;William Methuen&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"William%20Whyte%20%28railway%20manager%29\"&gt;William Whyte&lt;/a&gt;, a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway\"&gt;Canadian Pacific Railway&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimbing.\nMt. Whyte is usually combined with &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Niblock\"&gt;Mount Niblock&lt;/a&gt; () when done as a &lt;a href=\"scrambling\"&gt;scramble&lt;/a&gt;. However, while Mt. Niblock is rated a moderate scramble, Mt. Whyte is much more difficult due to additional &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20climbing%20terms%23exposure\"&gt;exposure&lt;/a&gt; and loose rock. The scramble should not be attempted in snowy conditions due to considerable fall distance which would likely prove fatal.\nFor rock climbers, the Perren Route (II 5.6) is another option. While mostly a scramble as well, a short section of difficult climbing near the top in addition to route finding challenges and loose rock will not make it an easy ascent."
