    "text": "De Witt (also: De Wit, De Witte and De With) is the name of an old Dutch &lt;a href=\"Patrician%20%28post-Roman%20Europe%29\"&gt;patrician&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"regenten\"&gt;regenten&lt;/a&gt; family. Originally from &lt;a href=\"Dordrecht\"&gt;Dordrecht&lt;/a&gt;, the genealogy of the family begins with Jan de Witte, a patrician who lived around 1295. The family have played an important role during the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Golden%20Age\"&gt;Dutch Golden Age&lt;/a&gt;. They were at the centre of Dordrecht and &lt;a href=\"Holland\"&gt;Holland&lt;/a&gt; oligarchy from the end of the 16th century until 1672, and belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20States%20Party\"&gt;Dutch States Party&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe De Witt family during the Dutch Golden Age.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Golden%20Age\"&gt;Dutch Golden Age&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; de Witt family opposed the &lt;a href=\"royalists\"&gt;royalists&lt;/a&gt; associated with the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Orange-Nassau\"&gt;House of Orange-Nassau&lt;/a&gt;. With other republican political leaders at Dordrecht, such as the van Slingelandts, and at Amsterdam with the &lt;a href=\"Bicker%20family\"&gt;Bicker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"de%20Graeff\"&gt;de Graeff&lt;/a&gt; families, the de Witts worked to abolish &lt;a href=\"stadtholder\"&gt;stadtholder&lt;/a&gt;ship. They sought full sovereignty for individual regions, so that the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Republic\"&gt;Republic of the United Seven Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; would not yield to authoritarianism. Instead of a sovereigns (or stadtholder), political and military power would be entrusted to the States General and Holland's city &lt;a href=\"regent\"&gt;regent&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFrom 1650 into the 1670s, the de Witts played leading roles in Dutch government. Republicans called this era the \"Ware Vrijheid\" (True Freedom), the &lt;a href=\"First%20Stadtholderless%20Period\"&gt;First Stadtholderless Period&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe de Witt family lost its leadership role in &lt;a href=\"Rampjaar\"&gt;Rampjaar&lt;/a&gt; 1672, when &lt;a href=\"Orangism%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;Orangists&lt;/a&gt; resumed leadership and murdered brothers &lt;a href=\"Johan%20de%20Witt\"&gt;Johan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cornelis%20de%20Witt\"&gt;Cornelis de Witt&lt;/a&gt;."
