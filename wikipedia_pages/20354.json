    "text": "A month is a unit of &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, used with &lt;a href=\"calendar\"&gt;calendar&lt;/a&gt;s, that is approximately as long as a natural &lt;a href=\"orbital%20period\"&gt;orbital period&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;; the words \"month\" and \"Moon\" are &lt;a href=\"cognate\"&gt;cognate&lt;/a&gt;s. The traditional concept arose with the cycle of &lt;a href=\"Moon%20phase\"&gt;Moon phase&lt;/a&gt;s; such &lt;a href=\"lunar%20month\"&gt;lunar month&lt;/a&gt;s (\"lunations\") are &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20month%23Synodic%20month\"&gt;synodic months&lt;/a&gt; and last approximately 29.53 &lt;a href=\"day\"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt;s. From excavated &lt;a href=\"tally%20stick\"&gt;tally stick&lt;/a&gt;s, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the &lt;a href=\"Paleolithic\"&gt;Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's &lt;a href=\"orbital%20period\"&gt;orbital period&lt;/a&gt; with respect to the Earth\u2013Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the &lt;a href=\"year\"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of months in astronomy.\nThe following types of months are mainly of significance in astronomy, most of them (but not the distinction between sidereal and tropical months) first recognized in &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20theory%23Babylon\"&gt;Babylonian lunar astronomy&lt;/a&gt;.\nA synodic month is longer than a sidereal month because the Earth-Moon system is orbiting the Sun in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth. The Sun moves eastward with respect to the stars (as does the Moon) and it takes about 2.2 days longer for the Moon to return to the same apparent position with respect to the Sun.\nAn anomalistic month is longer than a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in nine years. Therefore, the Moon takes a little longer to return to perigee than to return to the same star.\nA draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month because the nodes move in the opposite direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in 18.6 years. Therefore, the Moon returns to the same node slightly earlier than it returns to the same star.\nCalendrical consequences.\nAt the simplest level, most well-known lunar calendars are based on the initial approximation that 2 lunations last 59 &lt;a href=\"solar%20day\"&gt;solar day&lt;/a&gt;s: a 30-day full month followed by a 29-day hollow month\u2014but this is only roughly accurate and eventually needs &lt;a href=\"intercalation%20%28timekeeping%29\"&gt;intercalation&lt;/a&gt; (correction). Additionally, the synodic month does not fit easily into the &lt;a href=\"tropical%20year\"&gt;solar (or 'tropical') year&lt;/a&gt;, which makes accurate, rule-based 'lunisolar' calendars complicated. The most common solution to this problem is the &lt;a href=\"Metonic%20cycle\"&gt;Metonic cycle&lt;/a&gt;, which takes advantage of the fact that 235 lunations are approximately 19 tropical years (which add up to not quite 6,940 days). However, a &lt;a href=\"Metonic%20calendar\"&gt;Metonic calendar&lt;/a&gt; will drift against the seasons by about one day every 200 years. Metonic calendars include the calendar used in the &lt;a href=\"Antikythera%20Mechanism\"&gt;Antikythera Mechanism&lt;/a&gt; about 2,000 years ago, and the &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20calendar\"&gt;Hebrew calendar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe complexity required in an accurate lunisolar calendar may explain why &lt;a href=\"solar%20calendar\"&gt;solar calendar&lt;/a&gt;s (which have months which no longer relate to the phase of the Moon, but are based only on the motion of the Sun relative to the equinoxes and solstices) have generally replaced lunar calendars for civil use in most societies. Conversely, exclusively lunar calendars such as the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20calendar\"&gt;Islamic calendar&lt;/a&gt;, do not try to synchronise with the solar year. (Consequently, an Islamic year is shorter than a solar year and the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20New%20Year\"&gt;Islamic New Year&lt;/a&gt; has a different &lt;a href=\"Gregorian%20calendar\"&gt;Gregorian calendar&lt;/a&gt; date in each (solar) year.)\nMonths in various calendars.\nBeginning of the lunar month.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20calendars\"&gt;Hellenic calendars&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20calendar\"&gt;Hebrew Lunisolar calendar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20calendar\"&gt;Islamic Lunar calendar&lt;/a&gt; started the month with the first appearance of the thin crescent of the &lt;a href=\"new%20moon\"&gt;new moon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the motion of the Moon in its &lt;a href=\"orbit\"&gt;orbit&lt;/a&gt; is very complicated and its period is not constant. The date and time of this actual observation depends on the exact geographical longitude as well as latitude, atmospheric conditions, the visual acuity of the observers, etc. Therefore, the beginning and lengths of months defined by observation cannot be accurately predicted.\nWhile some like orthodox Islam and the Jewish &lt;a href=\"Karaite%20%28Jewish%20sect%29\"&gt;Karaites&lt;/a&gt; still rely on actual moon observations, reliance on &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20calendar%23Astronomical%20considerations\"&gt;astronomical calculations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tabular%20Islamic%20calendar\"&gt;tabular methods&lt;/a&gt; is increasingly common in practice.\n&lt;a href=\"Pingelapese%20language\"&gt;Pingelapese&lt;/a&gt;, a language from &lt;a href=\"Micronesia\"&gt;Micronesia&lt;/a&gt;, also uses a lunar calendar. There are 12 months associated with their calendar. The moon first appears in March, they name this month \"Kahlek\". This system has been used for hundreds of years and throughout many generations. This calendar is cyclical and relies on the position and shape of the moon.\nRoman calendar.\n&lt;a href=\"Roman%20calendar\"&gt;Roman calendar&lt;/a&gt; was reformed several times, the last three enduring reforms during historical times. The last three reformed Roman calendars are called the \"Julian\", \"Augustan\", and \"Gregorian\"; all had the same number of days in their months. Despite other attempts, the names of the months after the &lt;a href=\"Augustan%20calendar\"&gt;Augustan calendar&lt;/a&gt; reform have persisted, and the number of days in each month (except February) have remained constant since before the &lt;a href=\"Julian%20calendar\"&gt;Julian reform&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Gregorian%20calendar\"&gt;Gregorian calendar&lt;/a&gt;, like the &lt;a href=\"Julian%20calendar\"&gt;Roman calendars&lt;/a&gt; before it, has twelve months, whose &lt;a href=\"Anglicized\"&gt;Anglicized&lt;/a&gt; names are:\nThe famous &lt;a href=\"mnemonic\"&gt;mnemonic&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Thirty%20days%20hath%20September\"&gt;Thirty days hath September&lt;/a&gt;\" is a common way of teaching the lengths of the months in the English-speaking world. The knuckles of the four fingers of one's hand and the spaces between them can be used to remember the lengths of the months. By making a fist, each month will be listed as one proceeds across the hand. All months landing on a knuckle are 31\u00a0days long and those landing between them are 30\u00a0days long, with variable February being the remembered exception. When the knuckle of the index finger is reached (July), go over to the first knuckle on the other fist, held next to the first (or go back to the first knuckle) and continue with August. This physical mnemonic has been taught to primary school students for many decades, if not centuries.\nThis cyclical pattern of month lengths matches the &lt;a href=\"musical%20keyboard\"&gt;musical keyboard&lt;/a&gt; alternation of wide white keys (31\u00a0days) and narrow black keys (30\u00a0days). The note F corresponds to January, and the \"&lt;a href=\"diabolis%20in%20musica\"&gt;diabolis in musica&lt;/a&gt;\" note F corresponds to February, the exceptional 28\u201329\u00a0day month.\nNumerical relations.\nThe mean month-length in the Gregorian calendar is 30.436875\u00a0days.\nAny five consecutive months, that do not include February, contain 153\u00a0days.\nCalends, nones, and ides.\nMonths in the pre-Julian &lt;a href=\"Roman%20calendar\"&gt;Roman calendar&lt;/a&gt; included:\nThe Romans divided their months into three parts, which they called the \"calends\", the \"nones\", and the \"ides\". Their system is somewhat intricate. \nThe &lt;a href=\"ides%20%28calendar%29\"&gt;ides&lt;/a&gt; occur on the thirteenth day in eight of the months, but in March, May, July, and October, they occur on the fifteenth. The &lt;a href=\"Roman%20calendar%23Months\"&gt;nones&lt;/a&gt; always occur 8\u00a0days (one Roman \u2018week\u2019) before the ides, i.e., on the fifth or the seventh. The &lt;a href=\"calends\"&gt;calends&lt;/a&gt; are always the first day of the month, and before Julius Caesar's reform fell sixteen days (two Roman weeks) after the ides (except the ides of February and the intercalary month).\nRelations between dates, weekdays, and months in the Gregorian calendar.\nWithin a month, the following dates fall on the same day of the week:\nSome months have the same date/weekday structure.\nIn a non-leap year:\nIn a leap year:\nHebrew calendar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20calendar\"&gt;Hebrew calendar&lt;/a&gt; has 12 or 13 months.\nAdar 1 is only added 7 times in 19 years. In ordinary years, Adar 2 is simply called Adar.\nIslamic calendar.\nThere are also twelve months in the Islamic calendar. They are named as follows:\nSee &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20calendar\"&gt;Islamic calendar&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the Islamic calendar.\nHindu calendar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20calendar\"&gt;Hindu calendar&lt;/a&gt; has various systems of naming the months. The months in the lunar calendar are:\nThese are also the names used in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20national%20calendar\"&gt;Indian national calendar&lt;/a&gt; for the newly redefined months. Purushottam Maas or Adhik Maas (&lt;a href=\"Romanisation%20of%20Hindi\"&gt;translit.&lt;/a&gt; ' = 'extra', ' = 'month') is an extra month in the &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20calendar\"&gt;Hindu calendar&lt;/a&gt; that is inserted to keep the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20calendar\"&gt;lunar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"solar%20calendar\"&gt;solar calendar&lt;/a&gt;s aligned. \"Purushottam\" is an epithet of &lt;a href=\"Vishnu\"&gt;Vishnu&lt;/a&gt;, to whom the month is dedicated.\nThe names in the solar calendar are just the names of the &lt;a href=\"zodiac\"&gt;zodiac&lt;/a&gt; sign in which the sun travels. They are\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed calendar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20calendar\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed calendar&lt;/a&gt; is the calendar used by the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith&lt;/a&gt;. It is a solar calendar with regular years of 365 days, and &lt;a href=\"leap%20year\"&gt;leap year&lt;/a&gt;s of 366 days. Years are composed of 19 months of 19 days each (361 days), plus an extra period of \"&lt;a href=\"Ayy%C3%A1m-i-H%C3%A1\"&gt;Intercalary Days&lt;/a&gt;\" (4 in regular and 5 in leap years). The months are named after the attributes of God. Days of the year begin and end at sundown.\nIranian calendar (Persian calendar).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20calendar\"&gt;Iranian / Persian calendar&lt;/a&gt;, currently used in &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, also has 12 months. The &lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; names are included in the parentheses. It begins on the northern Spring equinox.\nReformed Bengali calendar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bangla%20calendar\"&gt;Bangla calendar&lt;/a&gt;, used in &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, follows solar months and it has six seasons. The months and seasons in the calendar are:\nNanakshahi calendar.\nThe months in the &lt;a href=\"Nanakshahi%20calendar\"&gt;Nanakshahi calendar&lt;/a&gt; are:\nKhmer calendar.\nLike the Hindu calendar, the Khmer calendar consists of both a lunar calendar and a solar calendar. The solar is used more commonly than the lunar calendar. There are 12 months and the numbers of days follow the Julian and Gregorian calendar.\nThe Khmer lunar calendar contains 12 months; however, the eighth month is repeated (as a \"leap month\") every two or three years, making 13 months instead of 12.\nTongan calendar.\nThe Tongan calendar is based on the cycles of the moon around the earth in one year. The months are:\nSinhalese calendar.\nThe Sinhalese calendar is the &lt;a href=\"Buddhist%20calendar\"&gt;Buddhist calendar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Sinhala%20language\"&gt;Sinhala&lt;/a&gt; names. Each full moon &lt;a href=\"Poya\"&gt;Poya&lt;/a&gt; day marks the start of a Buddhist lunar month. The first month is Vesak. \nGermanic calendar.\nThe old Icelandic calendar is not in official use anymore, but some Icelandic holidays and annual feasts are still calculated from it. It has 12 months, broken down into two groups of six often termed \"winter months\" and \"summer months\". The calendar is peculiar in that the months always start on the same &lt;a href=\"weekday\"&gt;weekday&lt;/a&gt; rather than on the same &lt;a href=\"calendar%20date\"&gt;date&lt;/a&gt;. Hence \u00deorri always starts on a Friday sometime between January 22 and January 28 \"\", G\u00f3a always starts on a Sunday between February 21 and February 27 \"\".\nOld Georgian calendar.\n \"New Year in ancient &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; started from September.\"\nOld English calendar.\nLike the Old Norse calendar, the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxons\"&gt;Anglo-Saxons&lt;/a&gt; had their own calendar before they were &lt;a href=\"Christianized\"&gt;Christianized&lt;/a&gt; which reflected native traditions and deities. These months were attested by &lt;a href=\"Bede\"&gt;Bede&lt;/a&gt; in his works \"On Chronology\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Reckoning%20of%20Time\"&gt;The Reckoning of Time&lt;/a&gt;\" written in the 8th\u00a0century. His &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; month names are probably written as pronounced in Bede\u2019s native &lt;a href=\"Northumbrian%20dialect\"&gt;Northumbrian dialect&lt;/a&gt;. The months were named after the moon; the new moon marking the end of an old month and start of a new month; the &lt;a href=\"full%20moon\"&gt;full moon&lt;/a&gt; occurring in the middle of the month, after which the whole month took its name.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Intercalation%20%28timekeeping%29\"&gt;intercalary&lt;/a&gt; month was needed, a third \"Litha\" month was inserted in mid-summer.\nOld Hungarian calendar.\nNagyszombati kalend\u00e1rium (in Latin: \"Calendarium Tyrnaviense\") from 1579.\nHistorically Hungary used a 12-month calendar that appears to have been zodiacal in nature but eventually came to correspond to the Gregorian months as shown below:\nOld Egyptian calendar.\nThe ancient civil Egyptian calendar had a year that was 365 days long and was divided into 12 months of 30 days each, plus 5 extra days (epagomenes) at the end of the year. The months were divided into 3 \"weeks\" of ten days each. Because the ancient Egyptian year was almost a quarter of a day shorter than the solar year and stellar events \"wandered\" through the calendar, it is referred to as Annus Vagus or \"Wandering Year\".\nNisga'a calendar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nisga%27a\"&gt;Nisga'a&lt;/a&gt; calendar coincides with the Gregorian calendar with each month referring to the type of harvesting that is done during the month.\nFrench Republican calendar.\nThis calendar was proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about twelve years from late 1793. There were twelve months of 30 days each, grouped into three ten-day weeks called \"d\u00e9cades\". The five or six extra days needed to approximate the tropical year were placed after the months at the end of each year. A period of four years ending on a leap day was to be called a \"Franciade\". It began at the autumn equinox:\nEastern Ojibwe calendar.\n&lt;a href=\"Ojibwe\"&gt;Ojibwe&lt;/a&gt; month names are based on the key feature of the month. Consequently, months between various regions have different names based on the key feature of each month in their particular region. In the Eastern Ojibwe, this can be seen in when the &lt;a href=\"Catostomidae\"&gt;sucker&lt;/a&gt; makes its run, which allows the Ojibwe to fish for them. Additionally, Rhodes also informs of not only the variability in the month names, but how in Eastern Ojibwe these names were originally applied to the &lt;a href=\"lunar%20month\"&gt;lunar month&lt;/a&gt;s the Ojibwe originally used, which was a &lt;a href=\"lunisolar%20calendar\"&gt;lunisolar calendar&lt;/a&gt;, fixed by the date of \"Akiinaaniwan\" (typically December\u00a027) that marks when sunrise is the latest in the Northern Hemisphere."
