    "text": "The Flow of (u) is a piece of music for three voices by &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Gaburo\"&gt;Kenneth Gaburo&lt;/a&gt;, composed in 1974.\nThe piece consists of \"one &lt;a href=\"note%20%28music%29\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; sung by three singers for twenty-three minutes\" on \"&lt;a href=\"Close%20back%20rounded%20vowel\"&gt;u&lt;/a&gt;\" whose goal is \"to sing in tune to such an extent that \u2026 this would consist of phase-coherent waves of sound.\" This, however, proves impossible, as singers must breathe, &lt;a href=\"Beat%20%28music%29\"&gt;beating&lt;/a&gt; occurs between nearly in tune pitches, and the &lt;a href=\"frequency%20spectrum\"&gt;frequency spectrum&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"harmonic\"&gt;harmonic&lt;/a&gt;s: \"Gently changing balances between the voices would result in very subtle glissandi of the harmonics of the spectrum being heard.\" The piece creates a \"(sonic) universe in this (linguistic) 'grain of sand'\".\nUnlike other minimalist works in which, compared to serial music, \"a certain level of articulational subtlety is eschewed in favor of an overall psycho-acoustic effect,\" in Gaburo's piece \"the focus is even more intense, and the attention to dynamic shaping given to the lines \u2026 is here transferred to the micro-level\".\nAn earlier work from Gaburo's Lingua series, \"Lingua IV\" (1970), for various media, bears a similar subtitle: \"The Flow of (i)2\"."
