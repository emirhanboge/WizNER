    "text": " is a Japanese professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Yokohama\"&gt;Yokohama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kanagawa%20Prefecture\"&gt;Kanagawa Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Tokyo%20Area\"&gt;Greater Tokyo Area&lt;/a&gt;. The club currently plays in the &lt;a href=\"J2%20League\"&gt;J2 League&lt;/a&gt;, which is the second tier of football in the country. The club was formed by fans of &lt;a href=\"Yokohama%20Fl%C3%BCgels\"&gt;Yokohama Fl\u00fcgels&lt;/a&gt; as a protest against Fl\u00fcgels' merger with &lt;a href=\"Yokohama%20Marinos\"&gt;Yokohama Marinos&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, becoming the first supporter-owned professional sports team in Japan.\nSince gaining J.League membership in 2001, Yokohama FC spent a long time in the second tier of the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Japanese football league system&lt;/a&gt;. The club gained promotion to &lt;a href=\"J.League%20Division%201\"&gt;J.League Division 1&lt;/a&gt; for 2007 season, as champions of &lt;a href=\"J.League%20Division%202\"&gt;J.League Division 2&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2006%20J.League%20Division%202\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, but were immediately relegated the following season. After twelve years in the &lt;a href=\"J2%20League\"&gt;J2 League&lt;/a&gt;, they returned to the top flight in the 2020 season, earning promotion the previous year.\nHistory.\nYokohama FC was formed in 1999 following the merger of Yokohama's two &lt;a href=\"J.League\"&gt;J.League&lt;/a&gt; clubs, the &lt;a href=\"Yokohama%20Fl%C3%BCgels\"&gt;Fl\u00fcgels&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yokohama%20F.%20Marinos\"&gt;Marinos&lt;/a&gt;. Fl\u00fcgels supporters felt that their club had essentially been dissolved rather than merged with, so rejected the suggestion that they should start supporting Marinos \u2013 who had been their crosstown rivals. Instead, with money raised through donations from the general public and an affiliation with talent management company &lt;a href=\"IMG%20%28company%29\"&gt;IMG&lt;/a&gt;, the former Fl\u00fcgels supporters founded the Yokohama Fulie Sports Club. Following the \"socio\" model used by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, the Fulie Sports Club created Yokohama FC, the first professional sports team in Japan owned and operated by its supporters.\nFor its first season in 1999, Yokohama FC hired former &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;German national team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Littbarski\"&gt;Pierre Littbarski&lt;/a&gt; to be the manager and &lt;a href=\"Yasuhiko%20Okudera\"&gt;Yasuhiko Okudera&lt;/a&gt;, the first Japanese footballer to play professionally in Europe, to be the chairman. The club attempted to gain entry directly into the professional J.League, but the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Japan Football Association&lt;/a&gt; only permitted entry to the amateur &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Football%20League\"&gt;Japan Football League&lt;/a&gt; (JFL), at the time the third level of the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Japanese football league system&lt;/a&gt;, and ruled that the club would not be eligible for promotion into &lt;a href=\"J.League%20Division%202\"&gt;J.League Division 2&lt;/a&gt; at the end of its first season. So, despite finishing as JFL champion in &lt;a href=\"1999%20Japan%20Football%20League\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, Yokohama FC finished as JFL champion again in &lt;a href=\"2000%20Japan%20Football%20League\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; before being promoted to J.League Division 2.\nThe club spent the next 6 seasons in J.League Division 2 before finishing as champions in 2006 and gaining promotion to &lt;a href=\"J.League%20Division%201\"&gt;J.League Division 1&lt;/a&gt;. In 2007, just the ninth year of its existence, Yokohama FC played its first season in the top flight of Japanese football. After a poor season, the team were consigned to relegation with five games of the season still remaining. Despite their early relegation, Yokohama FC nevertheless decided the final outcome at the opposite end of the table; by defeating title contenders &lt;a href=\"Urawa%20Red%20Diamonds\"&gt;Urawa Red Diamonds&lt;/a&gt; on the last day of the season, &lt;a href=\"Kashima%20Antlers\"&gt;Kashima Antlers&lt;/a&gt; secured the J.League Division 1 title.\nIn 2018, Yokohama FC narrowly missed out on automatic promotion by goal difference. The team made it to the J2 promotion final, losing to &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Verdy\"&gt;Tokyo Verdy&lt;/a&gt; on an stoppage time winner. In 2019, Yokohama finished second in J2 and gained automatic promotion to J1.\nFight for promotion.\nAlthough they had a dire season in 2005, ending 11th out of 12, they were in the top half of table throughout the 2006 season. On 26 November they finished in the top spot of the &lt;a href=\"J2%20League\"&gt;J2 League&lt;/a&gt;, and hence were finally promoted to the &lt;a href=\"J.%20League%201\"&gt;J. League 1&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis success story was so dramatic as to make people somewhat excited in Japan. Yokohama FC's financial situation was so poor that they didn't even possess their own football ground or a club house. Players did everything themselves including carrying the goal posts and washing the jerseys.\nOne of their players, &lt;a href=\"Kazuyoshi%20Miura\"&gt;Kazuyoshi Miura&lt;/a&gt;, is 54 and a former player, &lt;a href=\"Atsuhiro%20Miura\"&gt;Atsuhiro Miura&lt;/a&gt; (one of their main players before his 2010 retirement) was 36 when he last played for the club. These players once played for the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Japan national team&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey lost all pre-season matches, even against college students, then also the first official match of the year. After this, they suddenly changed the player-manager to a freshman with little experience named &lt;a href=\"Takuya%20Takagi\"&gt;Takuya Takagi&lt;/a&gt;, who was 38. At the beginning of the season few expected them to become champions.\nCurrent players.\nOut on loan.\n \nColours.\nAs they could not adopt directly Fl\u00fcgels' white and blue strip given its similarity to that of Marinos, Yokohama FC decided to adopt an all-&lt;a href=\"cyan\"&gt;cyan&lt;/a&gt; kit, after &lt;a href=\"NKK%20SC\"&gt;NKK SC&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"works%20team\"&gt;company club&lt;/a&gt; which had closed in 1994. NKK SC was based in &lt;a href=\"Kawasaki%2C%20Kanagawa\"&gt;Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt; and played most matches at &lt;a href=\"Todoroki%20Athletics%20Stadium\"&gt;Todoroki Athletics Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, but used Mitsuzawa Stadium on days when the other Kawasaki clubs at the time (&lt;a href=\"Verdy%20Kawasaki\"&gt;Verdy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toshiba%20SC\"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fujitsu%20SC\"&gt;Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt;) used it.\nManagers.\nAs of 23 February 2020."
