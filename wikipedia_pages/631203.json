    "text": "HMS \"Invincible\" was a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20warship\"&gt;ironclad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;. She was built at the Napier shipyard and completed in 1870. Completed just 10 years after , she still carried sails as well as a &lt;a href=\"steam%20engine\"&gt;steam engine&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmament.\nThe \"Audacious\" class was armed with ten muzzle-loading guns, supported by four muzzle loaders. These were located in a &lt;a href=\"Broadside%20%28naval%29\"&gt;broadside&lt;/a&gt; pattern over a two-&lt;a href=\"Deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; battery amidships\u2014this was the area of the ship least affected by its motion, and made for a very stable gun platform.\nEarly career.\nFor the first year of her career, she was a guardship at &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20upon%20Hull\"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt;, before being replaced by her sister . She was then transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;, where she served until 1886. She was sent to &lt;a href=\"Cadiz\"&gt;Cadiz&lt;/a&gt; in 1873 to prevent ships seized by republicans during the civil war in &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; from leaving harbour. She rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet in 1878 under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Lindsay%20Brine\"&gt;Lindsay Brine&lt;/a&gt;, but her poor state of seamanship attracted the ire of the commander-in-chief, &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20Hornby\"&gt;Geoffrey Hornby&lt;/a&gt;. In early 1879 \"Invincible\" blundered badly, putting two ships at hazard, and Brine was court-martialled. Though acquitted, Brine was relieved by Captain &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Fremantle\"&gt;Edmund Fremantle&lt;/a&gt;. She was &lt;a href=\"Beauchamp%20Seymour\"&gt;Admiral Seymour&lt;/a&gt;'s temporary &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt; at the 1882 &lt;a href=\"Bombardment%20of%20Alexandria%20%281882%29\"&gt;bombardment of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt; because his normal one, , &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;drew&lt;/a&gt; too much to enter the inner harbour. She provided men for the &lt;a href=\"naval%20brigade\"&gt;naval brigade&lt;/a&gt; that was subsequently landed and she also provided men for &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Beresford\"&gt;Charles Beresford&lt;/a&gt;'s naval brigade in the &lt;a href=\"Sudan\"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; campaign of 1885.\nLater career and shipwreck.\nShe made a trip to China in 1886 to carry out a new crew for \"Audacious\" before becoming the guardship at &lt;a href=\"Southampton\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt; until 1893. Her engines were removed in 1901 when she became a depot ship at &lt;a href=\"Sheerness\"&gt;Sheerness&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flotilla\"&gt;flotilla&lt;/a&gt;. She was renamed HMS \"Erebus\" in 1904, a name that she bore until 1906, when she was converted into a training ship at &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; for engineering &lt;a href=\"Armed-forces%20artificer\"&gt;artificer&lt;/a&gt;s and was renamed \"Fisgard II\" (\"Audacious\" had been renamed \"Fisgard\" in 1904).\nOn 17 September 1914, she sank during a storm off &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Bill\"&gt;Portland Bill&lt;/a&gt; with the loss of 21 of her crew of 64. She was being towed from Portsmouth to &lt;a href=\"Scapa%20Flow\"&gt;Scapa Flow&lt;/a&gt; where she was to act as a receiving ship for seamen newly mobilised for &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. She now lies upside down with the bottom of the hull about below sea level.\nHMS \"Fisgard II\" is a Designated vessel under schedule 1 of The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2012."
