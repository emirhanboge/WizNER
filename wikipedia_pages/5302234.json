    "text": "Amancio Amaro Varela, (born 16 October 1939), commonly known simply as Amancio, is a Spanish former &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player. Nicknamed \"El Brujo\" (The Magician) he played &lt;a href=\"Outside%20forward\"&gt;outside right&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a\"&gt;Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20CF\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Spain%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Spain national team&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nAmancio began his career aged 15 at local side Victoria Club de Futbol, in the district of &lt;a href=\"Falperra%E2%80%93Santa%20Luc%C3%ADa\"&gt;Falperra\u2013Santa Luc\u00eda&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1958\u201359 season, he joined &lt;a href=\"Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a\"&gt;Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;, which at that time was in the &lt;a href=\"Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Spanish second division&lt;/a&gt;. When Deportivo were promoted to &lt;a href=\"La%20Liga\"&gt;first division&lt;/a&gt;, Amancio started to call the attention of the scouts for major teams, such as &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20CF\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;.\nReal Madrid.\nThe signing of Amancio by Real Madrid almost did not happen; had it not been for &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Yeste\"&gt;Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Yeste&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s insistence in signing the player, his astronomical signing-fee would have spoiled the negotiations.\nAlong with the signing of Amancio by Real Madrid in June 1962, players such as &lt;a href=\"Ignacio%20Zoco\"&gt;Ignacio Zoco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Muller\"&gt;Lucien Muller&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yanko%20Daucik\"&gt;Yanko Daucik&lt;/a&gt; also arrived. During this time the team was in a transitional phase, since in earlier years the team had swept the competition both in Spain and outside its borders. Amancio made his debut in European competition opposite &lt;a href=\"R.S.C.%20Anderlecht\"&gt;Anderlecht&lt;/a&gt; (3\u20133 result in the &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium\"&gt;Santiago Bernab\u00e9u&lt;/a&gt;); and in the league against &lt;a href=\"Real%20Betis\"&gt;Real Betis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Seville\"&gt;Seville&lt;/a&gt; with a 5\u20132 win for Real Madrid.\nDuring the 1963\u201364 season, Amancio and Real Madrid reached the final of the European Cup, only to be beaten by &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Internazionale%20Milano\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; by 3\u20131. The following season brought more heartache, with &lt;a href=\"S.L.%20Benfica\"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt; eliminating the youthful Madrid side in the quarterfinals. The ensuing season brought success for Madrid, as &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Mu%C3%B1oz\"&gt;Miguel Mu\u00f1oz&lt;/a&gt; added young players such as &lt;a href=\"Pirri\"&gt;Pirri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Vel%C3%A1zquez\"&gt;Vel\u00e1zquez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Sanch%C3%ADs%20Mart%C3%ADnez\"&gt;Sanch\u00eds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20Grosso\"&gt;Grosso&lt;/a&gt;. This was known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Y%C3%A9-y%C3%A9%20%28Real%20Madrid%29\"&gt;Y\u00e9-Y\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\" team. Strong at the back, and devastating going forward, Madrid fought their way to another final, this time against &lt;a href=\"FK%20Partizan\"&gt;FK Partizan&lt;/a&gt;. The venue was &lt;a href=\"King%20Baudouin%20Stadium\"&gt;Heysel Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in Brussels, and on 11 May 1966, Amancio stepped out on to the pitch for his second and last European Cup final. &lt;a href=\"FK%20Partizan\"&gt;FK Partizan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Velibor%20Vasovi%C4%87\"&gt;Velibor Vasovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal of the match. Amancio drew level twenty minutes from the end, after collecting a signature pass, faking out a defender and skillfully booting the ball past the Yugoslav keeper &lt;a href=\"Milutin%20%C5%A0o%C5%A1ki%C4%87\"&gt;Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. Five minutes later, a thunderous shot by teammate &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Serena\"&gt;Serena&lt;/a&gt; from 30 metres out settled the game. It was Amancio's first and only European Cup winner's medal. In his first 6 seasons in Madrid, he won a breathtaking 6 La Liga titles. He would then go on to win another 3, giving him 9 titles in total. He even took the title of Pichichi on back to back occasions, 1969 and 1970.\nAs a Real Madrid player, Amancio's reputation reached such international fame, that he had the honour of being called for a world team, promoted by &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmancio retired in 1976 and joined the coaching staff of Real Madrid.\nSpain.\nAmancio wore the Spanish jersey on 42 occasions, debuting before &lt;a href=\"Romania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. With the team, Amancio was a participant of one of the greatest achievements in the history of the team: winning the &lt;a href=\"1964%20European%20Nations%27%20Cup\"&gt;1964 European Football Championship&lt;/a&gt; by a 2\u20131 score against the defending champions, the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer statistics.\nClubs.\nSource: \nInternational goals.\nSource: \nManagerial career.\nUpon retiring, Amancio began coaching the junior teams of &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20CF\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;. After one season, he decided to dedicate himself to his businesses. In 1982, he was readmitted by Luis de Carlos, who had just won the club's presidential elections.\nAmancio once again took charge of &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20Castilla\"&gt;Castilla CF&lt;/a&gt;, with which he won the &lt;a href=\"Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Segunda Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; in his second season. The team included the legendary \"&lt;a href=\"Quinta%20del%20Buitre\"&gt;Quinta del Buitre&lt;/a&gt;\", Made up of &lt;a href=\"Emilio%20Butrague%C3%B1o\"&gt;Butrague\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%C3%ADchel%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201963%29\"&gt;M\u00edchel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Sanch%C3%ADs%20Hontiyuelo\"&gt;Sanchis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Mart%C3%ADn%20V%C3%A1zquez\"&gt;Mart\u00edn V\u00e1zquez&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Pardeza%20Pichardo\"&gt;Pardeza&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1984\u201385 season, Amancio took charge of the first team. However, the outcome was not as good as expected, and he left his post. After a time as a consultant, Amancio left Real Madrid to join the sports company &lt;a href=\"Kelme%20%28company%29\"&gt;Kelme&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a representative responsible for the Madrid area.\nIn July 2000, Amancio was elected as a member of the board of directors of Real Madrid. From this position, he favored the incorporation of former Real players in different positions of responsibility of the club. The board of directors agreed that Amancio would be in charge of the 100th anniversary of Real Madrid."
