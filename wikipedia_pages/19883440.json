She was of &lt;a href=\"Greeks\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20peoples\"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; descent.\nFamily.\nAntiochis was the second daughter of King &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20I%20Theos%20of%20Commagene\"&gt;Antiochus I Theos of Commagene&lt;/a&gt; and Queen &lt;a href=\"Isias\"&gt;Isias&lt;/a&gt; Philostorgos. Unfortunately very little is known on Antiochis. The identity of her husband is unknown and she had a daughter called Aka, also known as &lt;a href=\"Aka%20I%20of%20Commagene\"&gt;Aka I of Commagene&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe appeared to have died of unknown causes sometime between the late 30s or early 20s BC. Antiochis was buried along with her mother and her daughter on a burial site known as the \"Karakush\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Karaku%C5%9F%20Tumulus\"&gt;Karaku\u015f Tumulus&lt;/a&gt;\"."
