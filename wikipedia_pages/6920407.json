    "text": "Startime International is a &lt;a href=\"record%20label\"&gt;record label&lt;/a&gt; founded in 2000 by Isaac Green, owned by &lt;a href=\"Sony%20Music\"&gt;Sony Music Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, based in New York City, and distributed by &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Records\"&gt;Columbia Records&lt;/a&gt;. Its roster includes &lt;a href=\"Foster%20the%20People\"&gt;Foster the People&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coin%20%28band%29\"&gt;Coin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Prass\"&gt;Natalie Prass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bully%20%28band%29\"&gt;Bully&lt;/a&gt;, Made Violent, &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20Del%20Mar\"&gt;Lewis Del Mar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Moon\"&gt;The Big Moon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nGreen moved to Brooklyn and out of his apartment started the label, armed with one band, the &lt;a href=\"French%20Kicks\"&gt;French Kicks&lt;/a&gt;. Startime's first release was the Kick's EP \"&lt;a href=\"Young%20Lawyer\"&gt;Young Lawyer&lt;/a&gt;\" in late &lt;a href=\"2000%20in%20music\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, and since then the label's roster has grown significantly with bands picked by Green not for their marketability but for sheer talent. This has paid off with a lot of indie cred points, and with more major labels looking to sign away Startime's acts like &lt;a href=\"Brendan%20Benson\"&gt;Brendan Benson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Walkmen\"&gt;The Walkmen&lt;/a&gt;. A compilation of Startime acts has been released, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.startimerecords.com/supercuts.html\"&gt;\"Supercuts\"&lt;/a&gt;."
