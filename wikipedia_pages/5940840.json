    "text": "German submarine \"U-703\" was a &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20VII%20submarine\"&gt;Type VIIC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt;\" deployed during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; against allied shipping in the &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Ocean\"&gt;Arctic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. She was a successful boat, which had a far longer service life than most other &lt;a href=\"U-boats\"&gt;U-boats&lt;/a&gt;, primarily due to the restricted zone of operations in which she fought. Her main mission during the war was to target the &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Convoys\"&gt;Arctic Convoys&lt;/a&gt; which carried supplies to the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; from Britain. At this she was quite successful in her three years of raiding until her presumed demise in 1944.\n\"U-703\" was built at &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; in Northern Germany on the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;. She was completed in the autumn of 1941, and given to the experienced \"&lt;a href=\"Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant\"&gt;Kapit\u00e4nleutnant&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Heinz%20Bielfeld\"&gt;Heinz Bielfeld&lt;/a&gt; to command. He took her on her working-up period in which the boat was tested and the crew trained in the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; and around the German held coastlines, before being dispatched to &lt;a href=\"Narvik\"&gt;Narvik&lt;/a&gt; in Norway for her first war patrol in April 1942.\nDesign.\n&lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20VII%20submarine%23Type%20VIIC\"&gt;German Type VIIC submarines&lt;/a&gt; were preceded by the shorter &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20VII%20submarine%23Type%20VIIB\"&gt;Type VIIB submarines&lt;/a&gt;. \"U-381\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20hull\"&gt;pressure hull&lt;/a&gt; length of , a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of , a height of , and a &lt;a href=\"draught%20%28ship%29\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; of . The submarine was powered by two &lt;a href=\"Germaniawerft\"&gt;Germaniawerft&lt;/a&gt; F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder &lt;a href=\"supercharged\"&gt;supercharged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s producing a total of for use while surfaced, two &lt;a href=\"Garbe%2C%20Lahmeyer%20%26amp%3B%20Co.\"&gt;Garbe, Lahmeyer &amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt; RP 137/c &lt;a href=\"Motor%E2%80%93generator\"&gt;double-acting electric motors&lt;/a&gt; producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two &lt;a href=\"propeller\"&gt;propeller&lt;/a&gt;s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"U-702\" was fitted with five &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es, one &lt;a href=\"8.8%20cm%20SK%20C/35%20naval%20gun\"&gt;SK C/35 naval gun&lt;/a&gt;, 220 rounds, and a &lt;a href=\"2%20cm%20FlaK%2030\"&gt;C/30&lt;/a&gt; anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20company\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; of between forty-four and sixty.\nService history.\nEnjoying the improving Arctic weather, \"U-703\" had an unsuccessful patrol in terms of victims, but the boat began to work better as a team, and the second patrol in May reaped dividends, with the sinking of the 6,000 ton American freighter SS \"Syros\". This ship sank with eleven lives after a torpedo touched off her ammunition. The same patrol scored greater success during the disastrous end to &lt;a href=\"Convoy%20PQ%2017\"&gt;Convoy PQ 17&lt;/a&gt; on the 5 May, when she managed to sink two lone cargo ships, one of them damaged by long range German bombers beforehand. Returning to port at Narvik, \"U-703\" was cheered by her victory, but she struggled to make further impressions during the year, as her two further patrols yielded only one victim, the British &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; , which was fatally crippled by a torpedo near &lt;a href=\"Convoy%20PQ%2018\"&gt;Convoy PQ 18&lt;/a&gt; in September.\nFollowing her lay-over in the winter as her home ports of Narvik, &lt;a href=\"Trondheim\"&gt;Trondheim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfest\"&gt;Hammerfest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harstad\"&gt;Harstad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bergen%2C%20Norway\"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt; were all frozen, \"U-703\" returned to the offensive, again attacking allied convoys in the Arctic Sea. Her first two patrols, in January and April were short and barren, but on the next two in July and August 1943 under her new commander Joachim Br\u00fcnner, she cruised in Soviet waters in the &lt;a href=\"Barents%20Sea\"&gt;Barents Sea&lt;/a&gt; and further east, catching a small Soviet &lt;a href=\"Naval%20trawler\"&gt;armed trawler&lt;/a&gt; on 1 August, and larger Soviet &lt;a href=\"merchant%20ship\"&gt;merchant ship&lt;/a&gt; the next day, sinking the SS \"Sergj Kirov\" near &lt;a href=\"Istvestij%20Island\"&gt;Istvestij Island&lt;/a&gt;. These patrols had shown the vulnerability of older U-boats to newer allied countermeasures and protection, forcing the submarines to divert themselves into backwaters of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic\"&gt;Battle of the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain any victories.\nThe \"U-703\" continued operating in the spring of 1944, but she was obviously less efficient and was given duties deploying weather balloons in the Arctic Sea to test weather conditions for reports to other shipping. This was in part a result of terrible damage she received off Narvik during her first patrol of the season, when allied aircraft strafed her, killing three crew and wounding three more. Just a few days before she had claimed her only victim of the year, the SS \"Empire Tourist\", which was sunk whilst part of &lt;a href=\"Convoy%20RA%2057\"&gt;Convoy RA 57&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelegated to her new duties, \"U-703\" suddenly disappeared around the 25 September 1944. She had left Narvik on her thirteenth war patrol on 14 September, in order to deploy a weather balloon in the Arctic. At the time a heavy gale was running, and it has been assumed that \"U-703\" foundered due to heavy seas in the course of this difficult and highly technical operation. No trace of the boat and her 54 crew has ever been found."
