    "text": "Investors Exchange (IEX) is a &lt;a href=\"stock%20exchange\"&gt;stock exchange&lt;/a&gt; based in the United States. It was founded in 2012 in order to mitigate the effects of &lt;a href=\"high-frequency%20trading\"&gt;high-frequency trading&lt;/a&gt;. IEX was launched as a national securities exchange in September 2016. On October 24, 2017, IEX received regulatory approval from the SEC to list companies. IEX listed its first public company, &lt;a href=\"Interactive%20Brokers\"&gt;Interactive Brokers&lt;/a&gt;, on October 5, 2018. The exchange said that companies would be able to list for free for the first five years, before a flat annual rate of $50,000. On September 23, 2019 it announced it was exiting its listing business.\nIn September 2019, IEX announced that Co-founder and COO John Schwall would retire from the company by the end of 2019.\nThe genesis and early days of the exchange are chronicled in the 2014 book \"\" by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Lewis\"&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFounding and first trading.\nFounded in 2012 and started by &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Katsuyama\"&gt;Brad Katsuyama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ronan%20Ryan\"&gt;Ronan Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, it opened for trading on October 25, 2013. The company\u2019s offices are located at &lt;a href=\"3%20World%20Trade%20Center\"&gt;3 World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. The matching engine is located across the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20River\"&gt;Hudson River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Weehawken%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Weehawken, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, and the initial &lt;a href=\"point%20of%20presence\"&gt;point of presence&lt;/a&gt; is located in a data center in &lt;a href=\"Secaucus%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Secaucus, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. IEX's main innovation is a coil of &lt;a href=\"optical%20fiber\"&gt;optical fiber&lt;/a&gt; placed in front of its trading engine. This 350 microsecond delay adds a round-trip delay of 0.0007 seconds and is designed to negate the certain speed advantages utilized by some high-frequency traders. The exchange's market session runs from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm Eastern Time.\nIn 2020, Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec made a strategic investment in IEX Group.\nFederal approvals.\nThe &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission\"&gt;SEC&lt;/a&gt; approved IEX to be an official exchange on June 17, 2016. In late 2016, IEX hired Sara Furber to lead its listing effort. A former managing director at &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Stanley\"&gt;Morgan Stanley&lt;/a&gt;, she reported to Katsuyama. The company aimed to start listing companies in 2017.\nAfter a 13-month wait, on October 24, 2017, IEX Group Inc. received regulatory approval from the SEC to list companies. IEX said it would begin listings in early 2018, with a focus on getting companies to switch over from other stock exchanges, by undercutting listing fees of rivals. The exchange said that companies would be able to list for free for the first five years, before a flat annual rate of $50,000. In comparison, &lt;a href=\"NYSE\"&gt;NYSE&lt;/a&gt; had annual listing fees as high as $500,000, and &lt;a href=\"Nasdaq\"&gt;Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt; up to $155,000. The \"Wall Street Journal\" wrote that the approval paved \"the way for the first competition to the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc. in nearly a decade... Companies seeking to list their shares on a U.S. exchange haven\u2019t had a choice besides NYSE or Nasdaq since 2008, when the &lt;a href=\"American%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;American Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; was acquired by NYSE.\" Only &lt;a href=\"Wynn%20Resorts\"&gt;Wynn Resorts&lt;/a&gt; Ltd. said publicly that it was considering a listing on IEX at the time of the approval announcement, with IEX not releasing more details on listings.\nExchange features.\nOperating principles.\nIEX was created in response to questionable trading practices that had become widely used across traditional public &lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street\"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; exchanges as well as &lt;a href=\"dark%20pool\"&gt;dark pool&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"alternative%20trading%20system\"&gt;alternative trading system&lt;/a&gt;s. The IEX exchange aims to attract investors by promising to \"play fair\" by operating in a transparent and straightforward manner, while also helping to level the playing field for traders. Strategies to achieve those goals include:\nThese strategies are intended to ensure the trustworthiness of the exchange. A few dark pools are owned by trading companies that pay for certain types of orders to allow them to fill orders within the pool, rather than routing orders to public exchanges. IEX offers no rebates for orders, and only charges a flat fee of $0.0009 per share on trades executed within the dark pool (or 0.30% with shares worth less than $1.00). Trades forwarded to other &lt;a href=\"trading%20venue\"&gt;trading venue&lt;/a&gt;s are charged a lower rate.\nIEX has five &lt;a href=\"order%20%28exchange%29\"&gt;order types&lt;/a&gt;: market, limit, primary peg (pegged to &lt;a href=\"National%20best%20bid%20and%20offer\"&gt;national best bid/offer&lt;/a&gt;), midpoint peg and patent-pending discretionary peg. IEX discretionary peg is a primary peg that may execute at up to midpoint price when the quote is stable. A few optional parameters can be attached to the orders, leaving IEX with many fewer order types than most other exchanges.\nIEX delays the flow of data from the exchange and ensures that it arrives simultaneously at two points of presence in New Jersey. Traders are not allowed to co-locate equipment adjacent to IEX's own servers, unlike many other trading platforms. IEX has its own low-latency links to other trading venues in the New York region, which it can use to execute trades for customers in under 320 microseconds. The point-of-presence links for traders to gain access to IEX have a built-in, round-trip delay of 700 microseconds from a 38-mile coil of fiber, so traders cannot beat IEX's own computers as orders propagate outward. The data delay prevents many predatory behaviors. It deters the practice of liquidity fading, where they peer into various trading venues and try to detect orders as they propagate from a broker's order router, and use this information to withdraw liquidity ahead of toxic order flow.\nBroker priority.\nBefore becoming an exchange, IEX operated a dark pool which did not adhere entirely to priority by price then time, unlike other U.S. trading venues. Instead, the IEX prioritized orders by price, followed by broker, and lastly time. Katsuyama argues that this arrangement advantages regular investors contrarily to high frequency trading (HFT) firms, by preventing, for instance, HFT firms from jumping to the top of the order queue and front-running normal investors.\nWhen IEX applied for exchange status, it dropped the broker-based priority mechanism, and as an exchange it gives priority to the best price first followed by the time of order submittal (as do other exchanges).\nLiquidity.\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20Lewis\"&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/a&gt;' book \"&lt;a href=\"Flash%20Boys\"&gt;Flash Boys&lt;/a&gt;\" focused on the new trading platform, arguing that it was better than other dark pools since it created an equal playing field for investors by slowing down trading and preventing HFT firms from front running orders. An advocacy group for high-frequency traders countered that liquidity-provider firms need speed and direct market connectivity to manage risk, and a market that limits speed, such as IEX, would be illiquid and expensive for &lt;a href=\"price%20discovery\"&gt;price discovery&lt;/a&gt;.\nIEX Cloud.\nIEX also offers an API service, allowing developers to query US and Canadian stock data."
