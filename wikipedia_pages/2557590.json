    "title": "Lagrange's identity",
    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"algebra\"&gt;algebra&lt;/a&gt;, Lagrange's identity, named after &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Louis%20Lagrange\"&gt;Joseph Louis Lagrange&lt;/a&gt;, is:\nwhich applies to any two sets {\"a\"1, \"a\"2, .\u00a0.\u00a0., \"an\"} and {\"b\"1, \"b\"2, .\u00a0.\u00a0., \"bn\"} of &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"complex%20number\"&gt;complex number&lt;/a&gt;s (or more generally, elements of a &lt;a href=\"commutative%20ring\"&gt;commutative ring&lt;/a&gt;). This identity is a generalisation of the &lt;a href=\"Brahmagupta%E2%80%93Fibonacci%20identity\"&gt;Brahmagupta\u2013Fibonacci identity&lt;/a&gt; and a special form of the &lt;a href=\"Binet%E2%80%93Cauchy%20identity\"&gt;Binet\u2013Cauchy identity&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a more compact vector notation, Lagrange's identity is expressed as:\nwhere a and b are \"n\"-dimensional vectors with components that are real numbers. The extension to complex numbers requires the interpretation of the &lt;a href=\"dot%20product\"&gt;dot product&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"inner%20product\"&gt;inner product&lt;/a&gt; or Hermitian dot product. Explicitly, for complex numbers, Lagrange's identity can be written in the form:\ninvolving the &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20value%23Complex%20numbers\"&gt;absolute value&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the right-hand side of the identity is clearly non-negative, it implies &lt;a href=\"Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz%20inequality\"&gt;Cauchy's inequality&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dimension%20%28vector%20space%29\"&gt;finite-dimensional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"real%20coordinate%20space\"&gt;real coordinate space&lt;/a&gt; R\"n\" and its complex counterpart C\"n\".\nGeometrically, the identity asserts that the square of the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by a set of vectors is the &lt;a href=\"Gramian\"&gt;Gram determinant&lt;/a&gt; of the vectors.\nLagrange's identity and exterior algebra.\nIn terms of the &lt;a href=\"wedge%20product\"&gt;wedge product&lt;/a&gt;, Lagrange's identity can be written\nHence, it can be seen as a formula which gives the length of the wedge product of two vectors, which is the area of the parallelogram they define, in terms of the dot products of the two vectors, as\nLagrange's identity and vector calculus.\nIn three dimensions, Lagrange's identity asserts that if a and b are vectors in R3 with lengths |a| and |b|, then Lagrange's identity can be written in terms of the &lt;a href=\"cross%20product\"&gt;cross product&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dot%20product\"&gt;dot product&lt;/a&gt;:\nUsing the definition of angle based upon the &lt;a href=\"Dot%20product%23Geometric%20interpretation\"&gt;dot product&lt;/a&gt; (see also &lt;a href=\"Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz%20inequality%23Applications\"&gt;Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality&lt;/a&gt;), the left-hand side is\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle formed by the vectors a and b. The area of a parallelogram with sides |a| and |b| and angle \"\u03b8\" is known in elementary geometry to be\nso the left-hand side of Lagrange's identity is the squared area of the parallelogram. The cross product appearing on the right-hand side is defined by\nwhich is a vector whose components are equal in magnitude to the areas of the projections of the parallelogram onto the \"yz\", \"zx\", and \"xy\" planes, respectively.\nSeven dimensions.\nFor a and b as vectors in R7, Lagrange's identity takes on the same form as in the case of R3 \nHowever, the cross product in 7 dimensions does not share all the properties of the cross product in 3 dimensions. For example, the direction of a \u00d7 b in 7-dimensions may be the same as c \u00d7 d even though c and d are linearly independent of a and b. Also the &lt;a href=\"seven-dimensional%20cross%20product\"&gt;seven-dimensional cross product&lt;/a&gt; is not compatible with the &lt;a href=\"Jacobi%20identity\"&gt;Jacobi identity&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuaternions.\nA &lt;a href=\"quaternion\"&gt;quaternion&lt;/a&gt; \"p\" is defined as the sum of a scalar \"t\" and a vector v:\nThe product of two quaternions and is defined by\nThe quaternionic conjugate of \"q\" is defined by\nand the norm squared is\nThe multiplicativity of the norm in the quaternion algebra provides, for quaternions \"p\" and \"q\":\nThe quaternions \"p\" and \"q\" are called imaginary if their scalar part is zero; equivalently, if\nLagrange's identity is just the multiplicativity of the norm of imaginary quaternions,\nsince, by definition,\nProof of algebraic form.\nThe vector form follows from the Binet-Cauchy identity by setting \"ci\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"ai\" and \"di\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"bi\". The second version follows by letting \"ci\" and \"di\" denote the &lt;a href=\"complex%20conjugate\"&gt;complex conjugate&lt;/a&gt;s of \"ai\" and \"bi\", respectively,\nHere is also a direct proof. The expansion of the first term on the left side is:\nwhich means that the product of a column of \"a\" and a row of \"b\" yields (a sum of elements of) a square of \"ab\", which can be broken up into a diagonal and a pair of triangles on either side of the diagonal.\nThe second term on the left side of Lagrange's identity can be expanded as:\nwhich means that a symmetric square can be broken up into its diagonal and a pair of equal triangles on either side of the diagonal.\nTo expand the summation on the right side of Lagrange's identity, first expand the square within the summation:\nDistribute the summation on the right side,\nNow exchange the indices \"i\" and \"j\" of the second term on the right side, and permute the \"b\" factors of the third term, yielding:\nBack to the left side of Lagrange's identity: it has two terms, given in expanded form by Equations () and (). The first term on the right side of Equation () ends up canceling out the first term on the right side of Equation (), yielding\nwhich is the same as Equation (), so Lagrange's identity is indeed an identity, &lt;a href=\"Q.E.D.\"&gt;Q.E.D.&lt;/a&gt;.\nProof of Lagrange's identity for complex numbers.\nNormed division algebras require that the norm of the product is equal to the product of the norms. Lagrange's identity exhibits this equality.\nThe product identity used as a starting point here, is a consequence of the norm of the product equality with the product of the norm for scator algebras. This proposal, originally presented in the context of a deformed Lorentz metric, is based on a transformation stemming from the product operation and magnitude definition in hyperbolic scator algebra.\nLagrange's identity can be proved in a variety of ways.\nMost derivations use the identity as a starting point and prove in one way or another that the equality is true. In the present approach, Lagrange's identity is actually derived without assuming it \"a priori\".\nLet formula_21 be complex numbers and the overbar\nrepresents complex conjugate.\nThe product identity formula_22 reduces to the complex Lagrange's identity when fourth order terms, in a series expansion, are considered.\nIn order to prove it, expand the product on the LHS of the product identity in terms of\nseries up to fourth order. To this end, recall that products of the form formula_23 can be expanded in terms of sums as\nformula_24\nwhere formula_25 means terms with order three or higher in formula_26.\nformula_27\nThe two factors on the RHS are also written in terms of series\nformula_28\nThe product of this expression up to fourth order is \nformula_29\nSubstitution of these two results in the product identity give \nformula_30\nThe product of two conjugates series can be expressed as series involving the product of conjugate terms. The conjugate series product is formula_31, thus\nformula_32\nThe terms of the last two series on the LHS are grouped as\nformula_33 in order to obtain the complex Lagrange's identity:\nformula_34\nIn terms of the moduli,\nformula_35\nLagrange's identity for complex numbers has been obtained from a straightforward\nproduct identity. A derivation for the reals is obviously even more succinct. Since the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality is a particular case of Lagrange's identity, this\nproof is yet another way to obtain the CS inequality. Higher order terms in the series produce novel identities."
