    "title": "Bird of prey",
    "text": "Birds of prey, also known as raptors, include species of &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; that primarily hunt and feed on &lt;a href=\"vertebrate\"&gt;vertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s that are large relative to the hunter. Additionally, they have &lt;a href=\"Bird%20vision\"&gt;keen eyesight&lt;/a&gt; for detecting food at a distance or during flight, strong feet equipped with &lt;a href=\"Talon%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;talons&lt;/a&gt; for grasping or killing prey, and powerful, curved &lt;a href=\"beak\"&gt;beak&lt;/a&gt;s for tearing flesh. The term \"raptor\" is derived from the Latin word \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Arapio%23Latin\"&gt;rapio&lt;/a&gt;\", meaning to seize or take by force. In addition to hunting live prey, many birds, such as &lt;a href=\"fish%20eagle\"&gt;fish eagle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vulture\"&gt;vulture&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"condor\"&gt;condor&lt;/a&gt;s, eat &lt;a href=\"carrion\"&gt;carrion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the term bird of prey could theoretically be taken to include all birds that primarily consume animals, &lt;a href=\"Ornithology\"&gt;ornithologists&lt;/a&gt; typically use the narrower definition followed in this page. Examples of birds of prey not encompassed by the ornithological definition include &lt;a href=\"stork\"&gt;stork&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;heron&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gull\"&gt;gull&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Phorusrhacidae\"&gt;phorusrhacid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skua\"&gt;skua&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"penguin\"&gt;penguin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"kookaburra\"&gt;kookaburra&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"shrike\"&gt;shrike&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the many &lt;a href=\"songbird\"&gt;songbird&lt;/a&gt;s that are primarily &lt;a href=\"insectivorous\"&gt;insectivorous&lt;/a&gt;. Some extinct predatory birds had talons similar to those of modern birds of prey, including &lt;a href=\"mousebird\"&gt;mousebird&lt;/a&gt; relatives (&lt;a href=\"Sandcoleidae\"&gt;Sandcoleidae&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Messelasturidae\"&gt;Messelasturidae&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Enantiornithes\"&gt;Enantiornithes&lt;/a&gt;, indicating possibly similar habits.\nCommon names.\nThe common names for various birds of prey are based on structure, but many of the traditional names do not reflect the evolutionary relationships between the groups.\nMany of these &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English language&lt;/a&gt; group names originally referred to particular species encountered in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;. As English-speaking people travelled further, the familiar names were applied to new birds with similar characteristics. Names that have generalised this way include: kite (\"&lt;a href=\"red%20kite\"&gt;Milvus milvus&lt;/a&gt;\"), sparrow-hawk or sparhawk (\"&lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20sparrowhawk\"&gt;Accipiter nisus&lt;/a&gt;\"), goshawk (\"&lt;a href=\"northern%20goshawk\"&gt;Accipiter gentilis&lt;/a&gt;\"), kestrel (\"&lt;a href=\"common%20kestrel\"&gt;Falco tinninculus&lt;/a&gt;\"), hobby (\"&lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20hobby\"&gt;Falco subbuteo&lt;/a&gt;\"), harrier (simplified from \"hen-harrier\", \"&lt;a href=\"hen%20harrier\"&gt;Circus cyaneus&lt;/a&gt;\"), buzzard (\"&lt;a href=\"common%20buzzard\"&gt;Buteo buteo&lt;/a&gt;\").\nSome names have not generalised, and refer to single species (or groups of closely related (sub)species), such as the &lt;a href=\"merlin%20%28bird%29\"&gt;merlin&lt;/a&gt; (\"Falco columbarius\").\nSystematics.\nHistorical classifications.\nThe taxonomy of &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Carl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; grouped birds (class Aves) into orders, genera, and species, with no formal ranks between genus and order. He placed all birds of prey into a single order, \"Accipitres\", subdividing this into four genera: \"&lt;a href=\"Vulture\"&gt;Vultur&lt;/a&gt;\" (vultures), \"&lt;a href=\"Falco%20%28bird%29\"&gt;Falco&lt;/a&gt;\" (eagles, hawks, falcons, etc.), \"&lt;a href=\"Strix%20%28genus%29\"&gt;Strix&lt;/a&gt;\" (owls), and \"&lt;a href=\"Lanius\"&gt;Lanius&lt;/a&gt;\" (shrikes). This approach was followed by subsequent authors such as &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin\"&gt;Gmelin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29\"&gt;Latham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20Turton\"&gt;Turton&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot\"&gt;Louis Pierre Veillot&lt;/a&gt; used additional ranks: order, tribe, family, genus, species. Birds of prey (order Accipitres) were divided into diurnal and nocturnal tribes; the owls remained monogeneric (family \u00c6golii, genus \"Strix\"), whilst the diurnal raptors were divided into three families: Vulturini, Gypa\u00ebti, and Accipitrini. Thus Veillot's families were similar to the Linnaean genera, with the difference that shrikes were no longer included amongst the birds of prey. In addition to the original \"Vultur\" and \"Falco\" (now reduced in scope), Veillot adopted four genera from Savigny: \"Phene\", \"Hali\u00e6etus\", \"Pandion\", and \"Elanus\". He also introduced five new genera of vultures (\"Gypagus\", \"Catharista\", \"Daptrius\", \"Ibycter\", \"Polyborus\") and eleven new genera of accipitrines (\"Aquila\", \"Circa\u00ebtus\", \"Circus\", \"Buteo\", \"Milvus\", \"Ictinia\", \"Physeta\", \"Harpia\", \"Spiza\u00ebtus\", \"Asturina\", \"Sparvius\").\nFalconimorphae is a deprecated &lt;a href=\"superorder\"&gt;superorder&lt;/a&gt; within Raptores, formerly composed of the orders Falconiformes and Strigiformes. The clade was invalidated after 2012. Falconiformes is now placed in &lt;a href=\"Eufalconimorphae\"&gt;Eufalconimorphae&lt;/a&gt;, while Strigiformes is placed in &lt;a href=\"Afroaves\"&gt;Afroaves&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern systematics.\nThe order Accipitriformes is believed to have originated 44\u00a0million years ago when it split from the common ancestor of the &lt;a href=\"secretarybird\"&gt;secretarybird&lt;/a&gt; (\"Sagittarius serpentarius\") and the accipitrid species. The phylogeny of Accipitriformes is complex and difficult to unravel. Widespread &lt;a href=\"Paraphyly\"&gt;paraphylies&lt;/a&gt; were observed in many phylogenetic studies. More recent and detailed studies show similar results. However, according to the findings of a 2014 study, the sister relationship between larger clades of \"Accipitriformes\" was well supported (e.g. relationship of \"Harpagus\" kites to buzzards and sea eagles and these latter two with \"Accipiter\" hawks are sister taxa of the clade containing \"Aquilinae\" and \"Harpiinae\").\nThe &lt;a href=\"Diurnality\"&gt;diurnal&lt;/a&gt; birds of prey are formally classified into six &lt;a href=\"family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;families&lt;/a&gt; of three different orders (Accipitriformes, Falconiformes and Cariamiformes).\nThese families (with the exception of Cariamidae) were traditionally grouped together in a single order &lt;a href=\"Falconiformes\"&gt;Falconiformes&lt;/a&gt; but are now split into two orders, the Falconiformes and &lt;a href=\"Accipitriformes\"&gt;Accipitriformes&lt;/a&gt;. The Cathartidae are sometimes placed separately in an enlarged stork family, Ciconiiformes, and may be raised to an order of their own, Cathartiiformes.\nThe secretary bird and/or osprey are sometimes listed as subfamilies of Acciptridae: Sagittariinae and Pandioninae, respectively.\nAustralia's &lt;a href=\"letter-winged%20kite\"&gt;letter-winged kite&lt;/a&gt; is a member of the family &lt;a href=\"Accipitridae\"&gt;Accipitridae&lt;/a&gt;, although it is a nocturnal bird.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nocturnal\"&gt;nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; birds of prey\u2014the &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014are classified separately as members of two &lt;a href=\"Extant%20taxon\"&gt;extant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;families&lt;/a&gt; of the order &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;Strigiformes&lt;/a&gt;:\nPhylogeny.\nBelow is a simplified phylogeny of &lt;a href=\"Telluraves\"&gt;Telluraves&lt;/a&gt; which is the clade where the birds of prey belong to along with passerines and several near-passerine lineages. The orders in bold text are birds of prey orders; this is to show the polyphly of the group as well as their relationships to other birds.\nMigration.\nMigratory behaviour evolved multiple times within accipitrid raptors.\nThe earliest event occurred nearly 14 to 12\u00a0million years ago. This result seems to be one of the oldest dates published so far in the case of birds of prey. For example, a previous reconstruction of migratory behaviour in one \"Buteo\" clade with a result of the origin of migration around 5\u00a0million years ago was also supported by that study.\nMigratory species of raptors may have had a southern origin because it seems that all of the major lineages within Accipitridae had an origin in one of the biogeographic realms of the Southern Hemisphere. The appearance of migratory behaviour occurred in the tropics parallel with the range expansion of migratory species to temperate habitats. Similar results of southern origin in other taxonomic groups can be found in the literature.\nDistribution and biogeographic history highly determine the origin of migration in birds of prey. Based on some comparative analyses, diet breadth also has an effect on the evolution of migratory behaviour in this group, but its relevance needs further investigation. The evolution of migration in animals seems to be a complex and difficult topic with many unanswered questions.\nA recent study discovered new connections between migration and the ecology, life history of raptors. A brief overview from abstract of the published paper shows that \"clutch size and hunting strategies have been proved to be the most important variables in shaping distribution areas, and also the geographic dissimilarities may mask important relationships between life history traits and migratory behaviours. The West Palearctic-Afrotropical and the North-South American migratory systems are fundamentally different from the East Palearctic-Indomalayan system, owing to the presence versus absence of ecological barriers.\" Maximum entropy modelling can help in answering the question: why species winters at one location while the others are elsewhere. Temperature and precipitation related factors differ in the limitation of species distributions. \"This suggests that the migratory behaviours differ among the three main migratory routes for these species\" which may have important conservational consequences in the protection of migratory raptors.\nSexual dimorphism.\nBirds of prey (raptors) are known to display patterns of &lt;a href=\"sexual%20dimorphism\"&gt;sexual dimorphism&lt;/a&gt;. It is commonly believed that the dimorphisms found in raptors occur due to sexual selection or environmental factors. In general, hypotheses in favor of ecological factors being the cause for sexual dimorphism in raptors are rejected. This is because the ecological model is less &lt;a href=\"Maximum%20parsimony%20%28phylogenetics%29\"&gt;parsimonious&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that its explanation is more complex than that of the &lt;a href=\"sexual%20selection\"&gt;sexual selection&lt;/a&gt; model. Additionally, ecological models are much harder to test because a great deal of data is required.\nDimorphisms can also be the product of &lt;a href=\"intrasexual%20selection\"&gt;intrasexual selection&lt;/a&gt; between males and females. It appears that both sexes of the species play a role in the sexual dimorphism within raptors; females tend to compete with other females to find good places to nest and attract males, and males competing with other males for adequate hunting ground so they appear as the most healthy mate.\nIt has also been proposed that sexual dimorphism is merely the product of &lt;a href=\"disruptive%20selection\"&gt;disruptive selection&lt;/a&gt;, and is merely a stepping stone in the process of speciation, especially if the traits that define gender are independent across a species. Sexual dimorphism can be viewed as something that can accelerate the rate of speciation.\nIn non-predatory birds, males are typically larger than females. However, in birds of prey, the opposite is the case. For instance, the &lt;a href=\"kestrel\"&gt;kestrel&lt;/a&gt; is a type of falcon in which males are the primary providers, and the females are responsible for nurturing the young. In this species, the smaller the kestrels are, the less food is needed and thus, they can survive in environments that are harsher. This is particularly true in the male kestrels. It has become more energetically favorable for male kestrels to remain smaller than their female counterparts because smaller males have an agility advantage when it comes to defending the nest and hunting. Larger females are favored because they can incubate larger numbers of offspring, while also being able to brood a larger clutch size.\nOlfaction.\nIt is a long-standing belief that birds lack any sense of smell, but it has become clear that many birds do have functional &lt;a href=\"olfactory%20systems\"&gt;olfactory systems&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, most raptors are still considered to primarily rely on vision, with raptor vision being extensively studied. A 2020 review of the existing literature combining anatomical, genetic, and behavioural studies showed that, in general, raptors have functional olfactory systems that they are likely to use in a range of different contexts.\nPersecution.\nBirds of prey have been historically persecuted both directly and indirectly. In the Danish Faeroe Islands, there were rewards \"Naebbetold\" (by royal decree from 1741) given in return for the bills of birds of prey shown by hunters. In Britain, kites and buzzards were seen as destroyers of game and killed, for instance in 1684-5 alone as many as 100 kites were killed. Rewards for their killing were also in force in the Netherlands from 1756. From 1705 to 1800, it has been estimated that 624087 birds of prey were killed in a part of Germany that included Hannover, Luneburg, Lauenburg and Bremen with 14125 claws deposited just in 1796-7. Many species also suffered from &lt;a href=\"lead%20poisoning\"&gt;lead poisoning&lt;/a&gt; after accidental consumption of lead shot when feeding on animals that had been shot by hunters. Lead pellets from direct shooting that the birds have escaped from also cause reduced fitness and premature deaths.\nAttacks on humans.\nSome evidence supports the contention that the &lt;a href=\"Crowned%20eagle\"&gt;African crowned eagle&lt;/a&gt; occasionally views human children as prey, with a witness account of one attack (in which the victim, a seven-year-old boy, survived and the eagle was killed), and the discovery of part of a human child skull in a nest. This would make it the only living bird known to prey on humans, although other birds such as ostriches and &lt;a href=\"Cassowary\"&gt;cassowaries&lt;/a&gt; have killed humans in self-defense and a &lt;a href=\"lammergeier\"&gt;lammergeier&lt;/a&gt; might have killed &lt;a href=\"Aeschylus\"&gt;Aeschylus&lt;/a&gt; by accident. Many stories of Brazilian Indians speak about children mauled by Uiruuet\u00ea, the &lt;a href=\"Harpy%20Eagle\"&gt;Harpy Eagle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tupi%20language\"&gt;Tupi language&lt;/a&gt;. Various large raptors like &lt;a href=\"golden%20eagles\"&gt;golden eagles&lt;/a&gt; are reported attacking human beings, but its unclear if they intend to eat them or if they have ever been successful in killing one.\nSome fossil evidence indicates large &lt;a href=\"birds%20of%20prey\"&gt;birds of prey&lt;/a&gt; occasionally preyed on prehistoric hominids. The &lt;a href=\"Taung%20Child\"&gt;Taung Child&lt;/a&gt;, an early human found in Africa, is believed to have been killed by an eagle-like bird similar to the &lt;a href=\"crowned%20eagle\"&gt;crowned eagle&lt;/a&gt;. The extinct &lt;a href=\"Haast%27s%20eagle\"&gt;Haast's eagle&lt;/a&gt; may have preyed on humans in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, and this conclusion would be consistent with &lt;a href=\"Maori%20folklore\"&gt;Maori folklore&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Leptoptilos%20robustus\"&gt;Leptoptilos robustus&lt;/a&gt;\" might have preyed on both \"&lt;a href=\"Homo%20floresiensis\"&gt;Homo floresiensis&lt;/a&gt;\" and anatomically modern humans, and the &lt;a href=\"Malagasy%20crowned%20eagle\"&gt;Malagasy crowned eagle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"teratorns\"&gt;teratorns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Woodward%27s%20eagle\"&gt;Woodward's eagle&lt;/a&gt; and \"Caracara major\" are similar in size to the Haast's eagle, implying that they similarly could pose a threat to a human being.\nAlthough not birds of prey, &lt;a href=\"Australian%20magpie\"&gt;Australian magpie&lt;/a&gt;s have injured bike riders and passersby alike by swooping at the back of their heads. In an extreme case, one swooping caused a mother who was carrying her five-month-old baby to trip over and fall, leading to the baby's death from critical &lt;a href=\"Traumatic%20brain%20injury\"&gt;brain injuries&lt;/a&gt; in August 2021."
