His side lost 2\u20130 on aggregate to eventual winners &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20de%20Marseille\"&gt;Olympique de Marseille&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;second round&lt;/a&gt; qualifiers for the group stage of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; in 1993.

In his second stint Raja had surprisingly sacked him in the 2001\u201302 season when they were seven points clear in the standings but officials felt the team were not playing attractive football and Raja ended up third after replacing him. During his third spell at the club Moldovan won the &lt;a href=\"Coupe%20du%20Tr%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Coupe du Tr\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt; and led the Moroccan side to the semifinals of the &lt;a href=\"CAF%20Champions%20League\"&gt;CAF Champions League&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2005%20CAF%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; losing 2\u20130 on aggregate against Tunisian side &lt;a href=\"%C3%89toile%20du%20Sahel\"&gt;\u00c9toile du Sahel&lt;/a&gt;.
