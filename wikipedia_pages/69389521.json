Although Puerto Rico has no natural units in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Park%20Service\"&gt;National Park System&lt;/a&gt;, the biodiversity of the island is recognized and protected through a &lt;a href=\"National%20forest%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;national forest&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"National%20Wildlife%20Refuge\"&gt;national wildlife refuge&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"National%20Wilderness%20Preservation%20System\"&gt;national wilderness&lt;/a&gt;, and numerous &lt;a href=\"State%20park\"&gt;state parks&lt;/a&gt; (often called \"national parks\" in Puerto Rico), nature reserves, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Puerto%20Rico%20state%20forests\"&gt;state forests&lt;/a&gt;, wildlife preserves and other designations on state, municipal and public-private administration levels."
