    "text": "The Vi\u1ec7t Minh (; abbreviated from , &lt;a href=\"Ch%E1%BB%AF%20N%C3%B4m\"&gt;Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A1n%20t%E1%BB%B1\"&gt;H\u00e1n t\u1ef1&lt;/a&gt;: ; , ) was a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20historical%20separatist%20movements\"&gt;national independence&lt;/a&gt; coalition formed at &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A1c%20B%C3%B3\"&gt;P\u00e1c B\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ho%20Chi%20Minh\"&gt;H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh&lt;/a&gt; on May 19, 1941. Also known as the Vi\u1ec7t Minh Front, it was created by the &lt;a href=\"Indochinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Indochinese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; as a form of &lt;a href=\"united%20front\"&gt;united&lt;/a&gt; national &lt;a href=\"front%20organization\"&gt;front&lt;/a&gt; in Vietnam.\nThe \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam \u0110\u1ed9c L\u1eadp \u0110\u1ed3ng Minh H\u1ed9i\" had previously formed in &lt;a href=\"Nanjing\"&gt;Nanjing&lt;/a&gt;, China, at some point between August 1935 and early 1936 when Vietnamese nationalist parties formed an anti-imperialist &lt;a href=\"united%20front\"&gt;united front&lt;/a&gt;. This organization soon lapsed into inactivity, only to be revived by the &lt;a href=\"Indochinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Communist party Of Indochina&lt;/a&gt; (ICP) and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh in 1941. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh established itself as the only organized anti-French and anti-Japanese resistance group. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh initially formed to seek independence for &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;French Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The United States supported France. When the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;Japanese occupation&lt;/a&gt; began, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh opposed Japan with support from the United States and the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh opposed the re-occupation of Vietnam by France, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Indochina%20War\"&gt;Indochina War&lt;/a&gt;, and later opposed &lt;a href=\"South%20Vietnam\"&gt;South Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; and the United States in the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe political leader and founder of Vi\u1ec7t Minh was H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. The military leadership was under the command of &lt;a href=\"V%C3%B5%20Nguy%C3%AAn%20Gi%C3%A1p\"&gt;V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p&lt;/a&gt;. Other founders were &lt;a href=\"L%C3%AA%20Du%E1%BA%A9n\"&gt;L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ph%E1%BA%A1m%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng\"&gt;Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam \u0110\u1ed9c L\u1eadp \u0110\u1ed3ng Minh H\u1ed9i\" is not to be confused with the \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam C\u00e1ch M\u1ea1ng \u0110\u1ed3ng Minh H\u1ed9i\" (League for the Vietnamese Revolution, abbreviated as \"Vi\u1ec7t C\u00e1ch\") which was founded by &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20H%E1%BA%A3i%20Th%E1%BA%A7n\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1ea3i Th\u1ea7n&lt;/a&gt;. Viet Cach later joined the Vietnamese National Coalition in 1946.\nWorld War II.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; occupied &lt;a href=\"French%20Indochina\"&gt;French Indochina&lt;/a&gt;. As well as fighting the French in the &lt;a href=\"battles%20of%20Khai%20Phat%20and%20Na%20Ngan\"&gt;battles of Khai Phat and Na Ngan&lt;/a&gt;, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh started a &lt;a href=\"Military%20campaign\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; against the Japanese. As of the end of 1944, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh claimed a membership of 500,000, of which 200,000 were in &lt;a href=\"Tonkin%20%28French%20protectorate%29\"&gt;Tonkin&lt;/a&gt;, 150,000 in &lt;a href=\"Annam%20%28French%20protectorate%29\"&gt;Annam&lt;/a&gt;, and 150,000 in &lt;a href=\"French%20Cochinchina\"&gt;Cochinchina&lt;/a&gt;. Due to their opposition to the Japanese, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh received funding from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. After the takeover of nationalist organizations and Emperor &lt;a href=\"B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i\"&gt;B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i&lt;/a&gt;'s abdication to the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, &lt;a href=\"Ho%20Chi%20Minh\"&gt;H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh&lt;/a&gt; declared Vietnam's independence by proclaiming the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;Democratic Republic of Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; on September 2, 1945.\nFirst Indochina War.\nWithin days, the Chinese &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; (Nationalist) Army arrived in Vietnam to supervise the repatriation of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Army\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Army&lt;/a&gt;. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam therefore existed only in theory and effectively controlled no territory. A few months later, the Chinese, Vietnamese and French came to a three-way understanding. The French gave up certain rights in China, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh agreed to the return of the French in exchange for promises of independence within the &lt;a href=\"French%20Union\"&gt;French Union&lt;/a&gt;, and the Chinese agreed to leave. Negotiations between the French and Vi\u1ec7t Minh broke down quickly. What followed was nearly ten years of war against France. This was known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Indochina%20War\"&gt;First Indochina War&lt;/a&gt; or, to the Vietnamese; \"the French War\".\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Minh, who were short on modern military knowledge, created a military school in &lt;a href=\"Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Ng%C3%A3i%20Province\"&gt;Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province&lt;/a&gt; in June 1946. More than 400 Vietnamese were trained by Japanese defectors in this school. These soldiers were considered to be students of the Japanese. Later, some of them fought as generals against the United States in the Vietnam War or, to the Vietnamese; \"the American War\".\nFrench General &lt;a href=\"Jean%20%C3%89tienne%20Valluy\"&gt;Jean \u00c9tienne Valluy&lt;/a&gt; quickly pushed the Vi\u1ec7t Minh out of &lt;a href=\"Hanoi\"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;. His French infantry with armored units went through Hanoi, fighting small battles against isolated Vi\u1ec7t Minh groups. The French encircled the Vi\u1ec7t Minh base, &lt;a href=\"Vi%E1%BB%87t%20B%E1%BA%AFc\"&gt;Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc&lt;/a&gt;, in 1947, but failed to defeat the Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces, and had to retreat soon after. The campaign is now widely considered a Vi\u1ec7t Minh victory over the well-equipped French force.\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Minh continued fighting against the French until 1949, when the border of China and Vietnam was linked together as a result of the campaign called \"Chi\u1ebfn d\u1ecbch Bi\u00ean gi\u1edbi\" (\"Borderland Campaign\"). The newly communist &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; gave the Vi\u1ec7t Minh both sheltered bases and heavy weapons with which to fight the French. With the additional weapons, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh were able to take control over many rural areas of the country. Soon after that, they began to advance towards the French-occupied areas.\nNorth Vietnam and the end of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh.\nFollowing their defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu\"&gt;Battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7&lt;/a&gt;, the French began negotiations to leave Vietnam. As a result of peace accords worked out at the &lt;a href=\"Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29\"&gt;Geneva Conference&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Geneva\"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland, Vietnam was divided into &lt;a href=\"North%20Vietnam\"&gt;North Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Vietnam\"&gt;South Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"17th%20parallel%20north\"&gt;17th Parallel&lt;/a&gt; as a temporary measure until unifying elections could take place in 1956. Transfer of civil administration of North Vietnam to the Vi\u1ec7t Minh was given on October 11, 1954. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was appointed &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20North%20Vietnam\"&gt;Prime Minister of North Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, which would be run as a &lt;a href=\"socialist%20state\"&gt;socialist state&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ngo%20Dinh%20Diem\"&gt;Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m&lt;/a&gt;, who was previously appointed Prime Minister of South Vietnam by Emperor &lt;a href=\"B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i\"&gt;B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i&lt;/a&gt;, eventually assumed control of South Vietnam.\nThe Geneva Accords promised elections in 1956 to determine a national government for a united Vietnam. Neither the United States government nor Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m's State of Vietnam signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference. With respect to the question of reunification, the non-communist Vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam, but lost out when the French accepted the proposal of Vi\u1ec7t Minh delegate &lt;a href=\"Ph%E1%BA%A1m%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng\"&gt;Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng&lt;/a&gt;, who proposed that Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of \"local commissions\". The United States countered with what became known as the \"American Plan\", with the support of South Vietnam and the United Kingdom. It provided for unification elections under the supervision of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, but was rejected by the Soviet delegation. From his home in France, Vietnamese Emperor &lt;a href=\"B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i\"&gt;B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i&lt;/a&gt; appointed Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m as &lt;a href=\"Leaders%20of%20South%20Vietnam%23Prime%20Ministers\"&gt;Prime Minister of South Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;. With United States support in rigging the referendum of 1955 using secret &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CIA) funding, Di\u1ec7m removed the Emperor and declared himself the &lt;a href=\"Leaders%20of%20South%20Vietnam\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Vietnam\"&gt;Republic of Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe United States believed Ho Chi Minh would win the nation wide election proposed at the Geneva Accords. In a secret memorandum, Director of CIA &lt;a href=\"Allen%20Dulles\"&gt;Allen Dulles&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that \"The evidence [shows] that a majority of the people of Vietnam supported the Viet Minh rebels.\" Diem refused to hold the elections by citing that the South had not signed and were not bound to the Geneva Accords and that it was impossible to hold free elections in the communist North. Vietnam wide elections never happened and Vi\u1ec7t Minh cadres who stayed behind in South Vietnam were activated and launched an insurgency against the government. North Vietnam also occupied portions of Laos to assist in supplying the insurgents known as the &lt;a href=\"Viet%20Cong\"&gt;National Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; (\"Viet Cong\") in South Vietnam. The war gradually escalated into the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Second Indochina War&lt;/a&gt;, more commonly known as the \"Vietnam War\" in the West and the \"American War\" in Vietnam.\nKhmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh.\nThe Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh were the 3,000 to 5,000 &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Kampuchea\"&gt;Cambodian communist&lt;/a&gt; cadres, left-wing members of the &lt;a href=\"Khmer%20Issarak\"&gt;Khmer Issarak&lt;/a&gt; movement regrouped in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Issarak%20Front\"&gt;United Issarak Front&lt;/a&gt; after 1950, most of whom lived in exile in North Vietnam after the &lt;a href=\"Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29\"&gt;1954 Geneva Conference&lt;/a&gt;. Khmer Issarak and United Issrak Front were under leadership of &lt;a href=\"Son%20Ngoc%20Minh\"&gt;Son Ngoc Minh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tou%20Samouth\"&gt;Tou Samouth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sieu%20Heng\"&gt;Sieu Heng&lt;/a&gt;, etc. It was a derogatory term used by &lt;a href=\"Norodom%20Sihanouk\"&gt;Norodom Sihanouk&lt;/a&gt;, dismissing the Cambodian leftists who had been organizing pro-independence agitations in alliance with the Vietnamese. Sihanouk's public criticism and mockery of the Khmer Issarak had the damaging effect of increasing the power of the hardline, anti-Vietnamese, but also anti-monarchist, members of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Kampuchea\"&gt;Communist Party of Kampuchea&lt;/a&gt; (CPK), led by &lt;a href=\"Pol%20Pot\"&gt;Pol Pot&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Khmer Issarak and United Issarak Front were instrumental in the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Kampuchean%20United%20Front%20for%20National%20Salvation\"&gt;Cambodian Salvation Front&lt;/a&gt; (FUNSK) in 1978. The FUNSK invaded Cambodia along with the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Army%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnamese Army&lt;/a&gt; and overthrew the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Kampuchea\"&gt;Democratic Kampuchea&lt;/a&gt; Pol Pot state. Many of the Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh had married Vietnamese women during their long exile in Vietnam.\nLaotian Vi\u1ec7t Minh.\n&lt;a href=\"Lao%20Issara\"&gt;Lao Issara&lt;/a&gt; (\"Free Laos\") is a political &amp; military organization of Laotian communists, led by &lt;a href=\"Phetsarath\"&gt;Phetsarath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Souphanouvong\"&gt;Souphanouvong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaysone%20Phomvihane\"&gt;Kaysone Phomvihane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phoumi%20Vongvichit\"&gt;Phoumi Vongvichit&lt;/a&gt; Lao Issara received training and supports from &lt;a href=\"Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Minh\"&gt;Vi\u1ec7t Minh&lt;/a&gt;. Under French intervention, Lao Issara was split into non-communists and communists. Laotian non-communists under leadership of Pretsarath later established the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Laos\"&gt;Kingdom of Laos&lt;/a&gt; which is part of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Union\"&gt;French Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever Laotian communists rejected the French offer and fought side by side with Vietnamese communists during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Indochina%20War\"&gt;First Indochina War&lt;/a&gt;. In 1950 Lao Issara was renamed to &lt;a href=\"Pathet%20Lao\"&gt;Pathet Lao&lt;/a&gt; (\"Laos Nation\") under leadership of &lt;a href=\"Souphanouvong\"&gt;Souphanouvong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaysone%20Phomvihane\"&gt;Kaysone Phomvihane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phoumi%20Vongvichit\"&gt;Phoumi Vongvichit&lt;/a&gt;, etc."
