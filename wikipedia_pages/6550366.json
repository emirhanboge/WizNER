    "text": "William Bowra (1752 \u2013 7 May 1820) was an English &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;er who played regularly for Kent teams from 1768 until 1788 and then for Sussex until 1792. He had 50 known first-class appearances between 1775 and 1792. His name was pronounced \"Borra\".\nBowra is thought to have been born at &lt;a href=\"Sevenoaks\"&gt;Sevenoaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;. In a \"Hampshire Chronicle\" report of a 1775 game, his name is spelt \"Bower\". Bowra was a useful batsman who was employed by &lt;a href=\"John%20Frederick%20Sackville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Dorset\"&gt;John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset&lt;/a&gt; as a gamekeeper. He is believed to have been an outstanding fielder in close positions as a great many catches were credited to him.\nThe Duke of Dorset was a great admirer of his play and the sources have recorded, perhaps as an anecdote, that Dorset used to sit on the railing round the &lt;a href=\"Vine%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Sevenoaks Vine&lt;/a&gt; ground to watch him bat, often exclaiming: \"Bravo, my little Bowra\".\nBowra subsequently played for the Brighton team during 1790\u20131792 and once made 60 not out for Brighton v &lt;a href=\"Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Marylebone Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;. At this time he was perhaps employed on one of Dorset\u2019s estates in Sussex. He returned to &lt;a href=\"Knole%20House\"&gt;Knole House&lt;/a&gt; in 1807, again as gamekeeper, and it is believed he stayed there till his death in 1820."
