    "title": "USS Nautilus (1799)",
    "text": "Nautilus was a &lt;a href=\"schooner\"&gt;schooner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ship%20naming%20and%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in 1799. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; purchased her in May 1803 and commissioned her USS \"Nautilus\"; she thus became the first ship to bear that name. She served in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Barbary%20War\"&gt;First Barbary War&lt;/a&gt;. She was altered to a &lt;a href=\"brigantine\"&gt;brigantine&lt;/a&gt;. The British captured \"Nautilus\" early in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt; and renamed her HMS \"Emulous\". After her service with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;, the Admiralty sold her in 1817.\nOrigins.\nHenry Spencer built \"Nautilus\" in 1799 as a merchant vessel on the Eastern Shore of &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. The Navy purchased her at &lt;a href=\"Baltimore\"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, Maryland, from Thomas Tennant. She was commissioned 24 June 1803, under Lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Somers\"&gt;Richard Somers&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst Barbary War.\n\"Nautilus\" sailed to &lt;a href=\"Hampton%20Roads\"&gt;Hampton Roads&lt;/a&gt;, whence she got underway on 30 June for the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;, carrying dispatches for the U.S. &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Squadron%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Mediterranean Squadron&lt;/a&gt; stationed there assigned to protect the interests of the United States and its citizens residing or trading in that area, and threatened at that time by the &lt;a href=\"Barbary%20States\"&gt;Barbary States&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Nautilus\" arrived at &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt; on 27 July and departed again on the 31st to deliver dispatches to Captain &lt;a href=\"John%20Rodgers%20%28naval%20officer%2C%20War%20of%201812%29\"&gt;John Rodgers&lt;/a&gt; in , then returned to Gibraltar to await the arrival of Commodore &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Preble\"&gt;Edward Preble&lt;/a&gt;, in , and join his squadron. \"Constitution\" arrived at Gibraltar on 12 September, and after provisioning, the squadron, less , sailed 6 October with vessels of Capt. Rodgers's squadron to &lt;a href=\"Tangier\"&gt;Tangier&lt;/a&gt;. This display of naval strength induced the Emperor of &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; to renew the &lt;a href=\"Moroccan%E2%80%93American%20Treaty%20of%20Friendship\"&gt;treaty of 1786&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 31 October 1803, the Tripolitans captured \"Philadelphia\" and the squadron's interests came to focus on &lt;a href=\"Tripoli\"&gt;Tripoli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tunis\"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;. Using &lt;a href=\"Syracuse%2C%20Italy\"&gt;Syracuse&lt;/a&gt; as their rendezvous point, the vessels appeared off Tunis and Tripoli at different times between November 1803 and May 1804. In February 1804, while Lt. &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Decatur\"&gt;Stephen Decatur&lt;/a&gt; daringly sailed into Tripoli harbor and burned the captured \"Philadelphia\", \"Nautilus\" cruised off Tunis.\nToward the end of the month \"Nautilus\" retired to Syracuse, returning to Tripoli in mid-March. During May and June she repaired at &lt;a href=\"Messina\"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt;. Departing 5 July, she joined \"Constitution\" off Tripoli on 25 July. During August and early September, she took part in the siege of Tripoli and saw action in five general attacks between 3 August and 3 September. For the next five months, she continued to cruise off Tripoli and Tunis, retiring periodically to Syracuse and &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;, whence in February 1805, she sailed to &lt;a href=\"Livorno\"&gt;Livorno&lt;/a&gt; to acquire a new mainmast.\nOn 27 April 1805, she arrived off &lt;a href=\"Derna%2C%20Libya\"&gt;Derna&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Derne\"&gt;attack, capture, and occupation&lt;/a&gt; of that town. She remained until 17 May, during which time she provided cover for the forces of &lt;a href=\"Hamet%20Caramanli\"&gt;Hamet Caramanli&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"Pasha\"&gt;Bashaw&lt;/a&gt; of Tripoli, as they went into action against the army of Hamet's brother &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20ibn%20Ali%20Karamanli\"&gt;Yusuf ibn Ali Karamanli&lt;/a&gt;, who had overthrown Hamet and assumed his title. Departing on the 17th, \"Nautilus\" retired to Malta with dispatches and casualties. At the end of the month, she returned to Tripoli and on 10 June hostilities ceased with the signing of a peace treaty.\n\"Nautilus\" remained in the Mediterranean for a year after the treaty went into effect, conducting operations from Malta and Gibraltar. In the spring of 1806 she was assigned to &lt;a href=\"Algiers\"&gt;Algiers&lt;/a&gt; for dispatch duty, sailing in June for the United States.\nBetween wars.\nArriving at Washington, D.C., in mid-July, \"Nautilus\" entered the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Navy%20Yard\"&gt;Washington Navy Yard&lt;/a&gt; there and was placed &lt;a href=\"Reserve%20fleet\"&gt;in ordinary&lt;/a&gt;. Reactivated in 1808, she was employed on the East Coast until entering the Navy Yard again in 1810. The Navy then altered her to a brig, giving her a battery of twelve 18-pounder (8\u00a0kg) &lt;a href=\"carronade\"&gt;carronade&lt;/a&gt;s. The Navy recommissioned \"Nautilus\" in 1811 and she joined &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Decatur\"&gt;Stephen Decatur&lt;/a&gt;'s squadron.\nCapture.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt; with Britain broke out on 18 June 1812, \"Nautilus\" gained the dubious distinction of being the first vessel lost on either side. A squadron built around the &lt;a href=\"Third%20rate\"&gt;Third Rate&lt;/a&gt; (64 guns) and the two &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20rate\"&gt;Fifth Rate&lt;/a&gt; frigates, (38 guns) and (32 guns), captured her off northern &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. \"Nautilus\" was 24 hours out on a cruise from New York when \"Shannon\" and \"Aeolus\" captured her on 17 July. At the time of her capture she mounted 16 guns, had crew of 106 men and was under the command of Lieutenant &lt;a href=\"William%20M.%20Crane\"&gt;William M. Crane&lt;/a&gt;.\nHMS \"Emulous\".\nThe British immediately but informally took \"Nautilus\" into service under the name \"Emulous\", having just lost the on 2 August. On 29 August the Admiralty formally purchased \"Nautilus\"/\"Emulous\" for \u00a33,252 17&lt;a href=\"shilling\"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; 2&lt;a href=\"pence\"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;. On 2 February 1813 \"Emulous\" was commissioned under Commander William Mackenzie Godfrey, on the &lt;a href=\"Halifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; station.\n\"Emulous\" proceeded to capture a number of American privateers or merchant vessels listed below:\nPost-war and fate.\nOn 22 July 1814, Godfrey removed to . Captain John Gore then took command on 23 July 1814 and remained until 3 February 1815. In June 1815 \"Emulous\" came under the command of Commander John Undrell, still on the &lt;a href=\"Jamaica%20Station%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;Jamaica station&lt;/a&gt;. His replacement was the newly promoted Commander Thomas Wrenn Carter, who removed to in April 1816. Her last commander was Lieutenant Caleb Jackson (acting).\n\"Emulous\" arrived at Deptford on 19 June 1816 to pay off and was laid up there. The Admiralty sold her for \u00a3900 in August 1817."
