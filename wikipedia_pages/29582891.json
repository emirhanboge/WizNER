    "text": "Two Step Cliffs () is the eastern face of a flat-topped sedimentary &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;, rising to about 680 m, immediately east of &lt;a href=\"Mars%20Glacier\"&gt;Mars Glacier&lt;/a&gt; on the east coast of &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Island\"&gt;Alexander Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antarctica\"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;. At the bottom of the cliffs is the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Step%20Moraine\"&gt;Two Step Moraine&lt;/a&gt;. First seen from the air by &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20Ellsworth\"&gt;Lincoln Ellsworth&lt;/a&gt; on November 23, 1935, and mapped from photos obtained on that flight by &lt;a href=\"W.L.G.%20Joerg\"&gt;W.L.G. Joerg&lt;/a&gt;. Roughly surveyed from the ground in 1936 by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Graham%20Land%20Expedition\"&gt;British Graham Land Expedition&lt;/a&gt; and in 1940-41 by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Antarctic%20Service\"&gt;United States Antarctic Service&lt;/a&gt;, who used the names \"Two Step Mountains\" and \"Table Mountain\" for this feature. The name Two Step Cliffs derives from the name used by USAS, and was suggested by &lt;a href=\"Falkland%20Islands%20Dependencies%20Survey\"&gt;Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey&lt;/a&gt; following surveys in 1949 as being particularly descriptive of this feature."
