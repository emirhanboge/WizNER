    "text": "Kanake (or Kanacke, Kana(c)k; pl. \"Kanacken\" or \"Kanaks/Kanax\") is a &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20ethnic%20slurs\"&gt;slur&lt;/a&gt; for people from &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20territorial%20entities%20where%20German%20is%20an%20official%20language\"&gt;German-speaking countries&lt;/a&gt; with roots from &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Europe\"&gt;Southeast Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Near%20East\"&gt;Near&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It is used as a &lt;a href=\"pejorative\"&gt;derogatory word&lt;/a&gt;, but also as a self-denomination.\nIt was transferred with more ambiguous connotations to Southern European immigrants in the 1960s, and is now usually used with an exclusively derogatory connotation against people with roots in the \"Orient\" (German term for the region which includes &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe word is originally derived from the &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20language\"&gt;Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt; word for human, \"kanaka\". Until 2009, several rough translations of the word \"Kanak\" were admitted: \"goddess\". In its resolution n\u00b05195, the Academy of the Polynesian languages Pa'umotu specified a definition more faithful to the primal &lt;a href=\"Polynesian%20languages\"&gt;Polynesian language&lt;/a&gt; \"Mamaka Ka\u00efo\" of origin, that of \"free man\"."
