It is mostly used for &lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs per the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aviation%20Administration\"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt;, this airport had 4,415 passenger boardings (enplanements) in &lt;a href=\"calendar%20year\"&gt;calendar year&lt;/a&gt; 2008, 3,560 in 2009, and 3,679 in 2010. The &lt;a href=\"National%20Plan%20of%20Integrated%20Airport%20Systems\"&gt;National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems&lt;/a&gt; for 2011\u20132015 categorized it as a \"&lt;a href=\"FAA%20airport%20categories\"&gt;non-primary commercial service&lt;/a&gt;\" airport.\nUntil 2018, the airport was subsidized by the &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Air%20Service\"&gt;Essential Air Service&lt;/a&gt; to provide passenger air service. The EAS funding was terminated in January 2018, as not enough passengers were utilizing the airport.\nFacilities and aircraft.\nChautauqua County/Jamestown Airport covers an area of 788 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s (319 &lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;ha&lt;/a&gt;) at an &lt;a href=\"elevation\"&gt;elevation&lt;/a&gt; of 1,723 feet (525 m) above &lt;a href=\"mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;mean sea level&lt;/a&gt;.

The Federal Aviation Administration rejected any restoration of EAS funding to the airport in February 2019, reiterating its previous stance in withdrawing the funds.\nGround transportation.\nThe airport is served by &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%2060\"&gt;New York State Route 60&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Tier%20Expressway\"&gt;Southern Tier Expressway&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarious taxis have access to and from the airport. &lt;a href=\"The%20Hertz%20Corporation\"&gt;The Hertz Corporation&lt;/a&gt; has a car rental counter.\nShops and restaurants.\nThe airport currently has no permanent shops.
