    "text": "The Appian Way (&lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;: Via Appia) is one of the earliest and strategically most important &lt;a href=\"Roman%20road\"&gt;Roman road&lt;/a&gt;s of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;. It connected &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Brindisi\"&gt;Brindisi&lt;/a&gt;, in southeast &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. Its importance is indicated by its common name, recorded by &lt;a href=\"Statius\"&gt;Statius&lt;/a&gt;, of (\"the Appian Way, the queen of the long roads\").\nThe road is named after &lt;a href=\"Appius%20Claudius%20Caecus\"&gt;Appius Claudius Caecus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20censor\"&gt;Roman censor&lt;/a&gt; who began and completed the first section as a military road to the south in 312 BC during the &lt;a href=\"Samnite%20Wars\"&gt;Samnite Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins.\nThe need for roads.\nThe Appian Way was a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20road\"&gt;Roman road&lt;/a&gt; used as a main route for military supplies since its construction for that purpose in 312 BC.\nThe Appian Way was the first long road built specifically to transport troops outside the smaller region of greater &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; (this was essential to the Romans). The few roads outside the early city were &lt;a href=\"Etruscan%20civilization\"&gt;Etruscan&lt;/a&gt; and went mainly to &lt;a href=\"Etruria\"&gt;Etruria&lt;/a&gt;. By the late &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Republic&lt;/a&gt;, the Romans had expanded over most of &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and were masters of road construction. Their roads began at Rome, where the master , or list of destinations along the roads, was located, and extended to the borders of their domain\u00a0\u2013 hence the expression, \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aall%20roads%20lead%20to%20Rome\"&gt;All roads lead to Rome&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Samnite Wars.\nRomans had an affinity for the people of &lt;a href=\"Campania\"&gt;Campania&lt;/a&gt;, who, like themselves, traced their backgrounds to the &lt;a href=\"Etruscans\"&gt;Etruscans&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Samnite%20Wars\"&gt;Samnite Wars&lt;/a&gt; were instigated by the &lt;a href=\"Samnites\"&gt;Samnites&lt;/a&gt; when Rome attempted to ally itself with the city of &lt;a href=\"Capua\"&gt;Capua&lt;/a&gt; in Campania. The &lt;a href=\"Italic%20languages\"&gt;Italic&lt;/a&gt; speakers in &lt;a href=\"Latium\"&gt;Latium&lt;/a&gt; had long ago been subdued and incorporated into the Roman state. They were responsible for changing Rome from a primarily Etruscan to a primarily Italic state.\nDense populations of sovereign Samnites remained in the mountains north of Capua, which is just north of the &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Neapolis&lt;/a&gt;. Around 343\u00a0BC, Rome and Capua attempted to form an alliance. The Samnites reacted with military force.\nThe barrier of the Pontine Marshes.\nBetween Capua and Rome lay the &lt;a href=\"Pontine%20Marshes\"&gt;Pontine Marshes&lt;/a&gt; (\"Pomptinae paludes\"), a &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt; infested with &lt;a href=\"malaria\"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;. A tortuous coastal road wound between &lt;a href=\"Ostia%20Antica%20%28archaeological%20site%29\"&gt;Ostia&lt;/a&gt; at the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Tiber\"&gt;Tiber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neapolis%2C%20Apulia\"&gt;Neapolis&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Via%20Latina\"&gt;Via Latina&lt;/a&gt; followed its ancient and scarcely more accessible path along the foothills of &lt;a href=\"Monti%20Laziali\"&gt;Monti Laziali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Monti%20Lepini\"&gt;Monti Lepini&lt;/a&gt;, which are visible towering over the former marsh.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"First%20Samnite%20War\"&gt;First Samnite War&lt;/a&gt; (343\u2013341\u00a0BC) the Romans found they could not support or resupply troops in the field against the Samnites across the marsh. A revolt of the &lt;a href=\"Latin%20League\"&gt;Latin League&lt;/a&gt; drained their resources further. They gave up the attempted alliance and settled with &lt;a href=\"Samnium\"&gt;Samnium&lt;/a&gt;.\nColonization to the southeast.\nThe Romans were only biding their time while they looked for a solution. The first answer was the &lt;a href=\"colony\"&gt;colonia&lt;/a&gt;, a \"cultivation\" of settlers from Rome, who would maintain a permanent base of operations. The &lt;a href=\"Second%20Samnite%20War\"&gt;Second Samnite War&lt;/a&gt; (327\u2013304\u00a0BC) erupted when Rome attempted to place a colony at &lt;a href=\"Cales\"&gt;Cales&lt;/a&gt; in 334 BC and again at &lt;a href=\"Fregellae\"&gt;Fregellae&lt;/a&gt; in 328 BC on the other side of the marshes. The Samnites, now a major power after defeating the &lt;a href=\"Greeks%20in%20Italy\"&gt;Greeks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Taranto\"&gt;Tarentum&lt;/a&gt;, occupied Neapolis to try to ensure its loyalty. The Neapolitans appealed to Rome, which sent an army and expelled the Samnites from Neapolis.\nAppius Claudius' beginning of the works.\nIn 312\u00a0BC, &lt;a href=\"Appius%20Claudius%20Caecus\"&gt;Appius Claudius Caecus&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"Roman%20censor\"&gt;censor&lt;/a&gt; at Rome. He was of the &lt;a href=\"gens%20Claudia\"&gt;gens Claudia&lt;/a&gt;, who were &lt;a href=\"Patrician%20%28ancient%20Rome%29\"&gt;patricians&lt;/a&gt; descended from the &lt;a href=\"Sabines\"&gt;Sabines&lt;/a&gt; taken into the early Roman state. He had been given the name of the founding ancestor of the gens, Appius Claudius (Attus Clausus in Sabine). He was a &lt;a href=\"Populism\"&gt;populist&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., an advocate of the common people. A man of inner perspicacity, in the years of success he was said to have lost his outer vision and thus acquired the name , \"blind\".\nWithout waiting to be told what to do by the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Senate\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;, Appius Claudius began bold public works to address the supply problem. An aqueduct (the &lt;a href=\"Aqua%20Appia\"&gt;Aqua Appia&lt;/a&gt;) secured the water supply of the city of Rome. By far the best known project was the road, which ran across the &lt;a href=\"Pontine%20Marshes\"&gt;Pontine Marshes&lt;/a&gt; to the coast northwest of &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;, where it turned north to Capua. On it, any number of fresh troops could be sped to the theatre of operations, and supplies could be moved en masse to Roman bases without hindrance by either enemy or terrain. It is no surprise that, after his term as censor, Appius Claudius became &lt;a href=\"Roman%20consul\"&gt;consul&lt;/a&gt; twice, subsequently held other offices, and was a respected consultant to the state even during his later years.\nThe success of the road.\nThe road achieved its purpose. The outcome of the Second Samnite War was at last favorable to Rome. In a series of blows the Romans reversed their fortunes, bringing Etruria to the table in 311\u00a0BC, the very year of their revolt, and &lt;a href=\"Samnium\"&gt;Samnium&lt;/a&gt; in 304 BC. The road was the main factor that allowed them to concentrate their forces with sufficient rapidity and to keep them adequately supplied, whereafter they became a formidable opponent.\nConstruction of the road.\nThe main part of the Appian Way was started and finished in 312\u00a0BC.\nThe road began as a leveled dirt road upon which small stones and &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20%28masonry%29\"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt; were laid. Gravel was laid upon this, which was finally topped with tight fitting, interlocking stones to provide a flat surface. The historian Procopius said that the stones fit together so securely and closely that they appeared to have grown together rather than to have been fitted together. The road was cambered in the middle (for water runoff) and had ditches on either side of the road which were protected by retaining walls.\nBetween Rome and Lake Albano.\nThe road began in the &lt;a href=\"Forum%20Romanum\"&gt;Forum Romanum&lt;/a&gt;, passed through the &lt;a href=\"Servian%20Wall\"&gt;Servian Wall&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"porta%20Capena\"&gt;porta Capena&lt;/a&gt;, went through a cutting in the &lt;a href=\"clivus%20Martis\"&gt;clivus Martis&lt;/a&gt;, and left the city. For this stretch of the road, the builders used the Via Latina. The building of the &lt;a href=\"Aurelian%20Wall\"&gt;Aurelian Wall&lt;/a&gt; centuries later required the placing of another gate, the &lt;a href=\"Porta%20Appia\"&gt;Porta Appia&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of Rome the new Via Appia went through well-to-do suburbs along the Via Norba, the ancient track to the &lt;a href=\"Alban%20hills\"&gt;Alban hills&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Norba\"&gt;Norba&lt;/a&gt; was situated. The road at the time was a via glarea, a gravel road. The Romans built a high-quality road, with layers of cemented stone over a layer of small stones, cambered, drainage ditches on either side, low retaining walls on sunken portions, and dirt pathways for sidewalks. The Via Appia is believed to have been the first Roman road to feature the use of lime cement. The materials were volcanic rock. The surface was said to have been so smooth that you could not distinguish the joints. The Roman section still exists and is lined with monuments of all periods, although the cement has eroded out of the joints, leaving a very rough surface.\nAcross the marsh.\nThe road concedes nothing to the &lt;a href=\"Alban%20hills\"&gt;Alban hills&lt;/a&gt;, but goes straight through them over cuts and fills. The gradients are steep. Then it enters the former Pontine Marshes. A stone causeway of about led across stagnant and foul-smelling pools blocked from the sea by sand dunes. Appius Claudius planned to drain the marsh, taking up earlier attempts, but he failed. The causeway and its bridges subsequently needed constant repair. No one enjoyed crossing the marsh. In 162\u00a0BC, Marcus Cornelius Cathegus had a canal constructed along the road to relieve the traffic and provide an alternative when the road was being repaired. Romans preferred using the canal.\nAlong the coast.\nThe Via Appia picked up the coastal road at &lt;a href=\"Terracina\"&gt;Tarracina&lt;/a&gt; (Terracina). However, the Romans straightened it somewhat with cuttings, which form cliffs today. From there the road swerved north to Capua, where, for the time being, it ended. Caudine Forks was not far to the north. The itinerary was &lt;a href=\"Ariccia\"&gt;Aricia&lt;/a&gt; (Ariccia), &lt;a href=\"Three%20Taverns\"&gt;Tres Tabernae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forum%20Appii\"&gt;Forum Appii&lt;/a&gt;, Tarracina, &lt;a href=\"Fondi%2C%20Italy\"&gt;Fundi&lt;/a&gt; (Fondi), &lt;a href=\"Formiae\"&gt;Formiae&lt;/a&gt; (Formia), &lt;a href=\"Minturnae\"&gt;Minturnae&lt;/a&gt; (Minturno), &lt;a href=\"Suessa%20Pometia\"&gt;Suessa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Casilinum\"&gt;Casilinum&lt;/a&gt; and Capua, but some of these were colonies added after the Samnite Wars. The distance was . The original road had no milestones, as they were not yet in use. A few survive from later times, including a first milestone near the porta Appia.\nExtension to Beneventum.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Third%20Samnite%20War\"&gt;Third Samnite War&lt;/a&gt; (298\u2013290\u00a0BC) is perhaps misnamed. It was an all-out attempt by all the neighbors of Rome: Italics, Etruscans and &lt;a href=\"Gauls\"&gt;Gauls&lt;/a&gt;, to check the power of Rome. The Samnites were the leading people of the conspiracy. Rome dealt the northerners a crushing blow at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sentinum\"&gt;Battle of Sentinum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Umbria\"&gt;Umbria&lt;/a&gt; in 295. The Samnites fought on alone. Rome now placed 13 colonies in Campania and Samnium. It must have been during this time that they extended the Via Appia 35 miles beyond Capua past the Caudine forks to a place the Samnites called Maloenton, \"passage of the flocks\". The itinerary added &lt;a href=\"Calatia\"&gt;Calatia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caudium\"&gt;Caudium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benevento\"&gt;Beneventum&lt;/a&gt; (not yet called that). Here also ended the &lt;a href=\"Via%20Latina\"&gt;Via Latina&lt;/a&gt;.\nExtension to Apulia and Calabria.\nBy 290\u00a0BC, the sovereignty of the Samnites had ended. The heel of Italy lay open to the Romans. The dates are somewhat uncertain and there is considerable variation in the sources, but during the Third Samnite War the Romans seem to have extended the road to &lt;a href=\"Venusia\"&gt;Venusia&lt;/a&gt;, where they placed a colony of 20,000\u00a0men. After that they were at Tarentum.\nRoman expansion alarmed Tarentum, the leading city of the Greek presence (Magna Graecia) in southern Italy. They hired the mercenary, King &lt;a href=\"Pyrrhus%20of%20Epirus\"&gt;Pyrrhus of Epirus&lt;/a&gt;, in neighboring &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; to fight the Romans on their behalf. In 280\u00a0BC the Romans suffered a defeat at the hands of Pyrrhus at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Heraclea\"&gt;Battle of Heraclea&lt;/a&gt; on the coast west of &lt;a href=\"Taranto\"&gt;Tarentum&lt;/a&gt;. The battle was costly for both sides, prompting Pyrrhus to remark \"One more such victory and I am lost.\" Making the best of it, the Roman army turned on Greek &lt;a href=\"Rhegium\"&gt;Rhegium&lt;/a&gt; and effected a massacre of Pyrrhian partisans there.\nRather than pursue them, Pyrrhus went straight for Rome along the Via Appia and then the Via Latina. He knew that if he continued on the Via Appia he could be trapped in the marsh. Wary of such entrapment on the Via Latina also, he withdrew without fighting after encountering opposition at &lt;a href=\"Anagni\"&gt;Anagni&lt;/a&gt;. Wintering in &lt;a href=\"Campania\"&gt;Campania&lt;/a&gt;, he withdrew to Apulia in 279\u00a0BC, where, pursued by the Romans, he won a second costly victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Asculum\"&gt;Battle of Asculum&lt;/a&gt;. Withdrawing from Apulia for a Sicilian interlude, he returned to Apulia in 275\u00a0BC and started for Campania up the Roman road.\nSupplied by that same road, the Romans successfully defended the region against Pyrrhus, crushing his army in a two-day fight at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Beneventum%20%28275%20BC%29\"&gt;Battle of Beneventum&lt;/a&gt; in 275\u00a0BC. The Romans renamed the town from \"Maleventum\" (\"site of bad events\") to Beneventum (\"site of good events\") as a result. Pyrrhus withdrew to Greece, where he died in a street fight in Argos in 272\u00a0BC. Tarentum fell to the Romans that same year, who proceeded to consolidate their rule over all of Italy.\nThe Romans pushed the Via Appia to the port of &lt;a href=\"Brundisium\"&gt;Brundisium&lt;/a&gt; in 264\u00a0BC. The itinerary from Beneventum was now &lt;a href=\"Venusia\"&gt;Venusia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gravina%20in%20Puglia\"&gt;Silvium&lt;/a&gt;, Tarentum, &lt;a href=\"Oria%20%28town%29\"&gt;Uria&lt;/a&gt; and Brundisium. The Roman Republic was the government of Italy, for the time being. Appius Claudius died in 273, but in extending the road a number of times, no one has tried to displace his name upon it.\nRediscovery.\nThe Appian Way's path across today's regions &lt;a href=\"Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Campania\"&gt;Campania&lt;/a&gt; has always been well known, while the exact position of the part located in Apulia (the original one, not the extension by Trajan) was unknown, since there were no visible remains of the Appian Way in that region.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the professor of ancient Roman topography &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Lugli\"&gt;Giuseppe Lugli&lt;/a&gt; managed to discover, with the then innovative technique of &lt;a href=\"photogrammetry\"&gt;photogrammetry&lt;/a&gt;, what probably was the route of the Appian Way from &lt;a href=\"Gravina%20in%20Puglia\"&gt;Gravina in Puglia&lt;/a&gt; (\"Silvium\") up to &lt;a href=\"Taranto\"&gt;Taranto&lt;/a&gt;. When analysing &lt;a href=\"aerophotogrammetry\"&gt;aerophotogrammetric&lt;/a&gt; shots of the area, Lugli noticed a path () named \"la Tarantina\", whose direction was still largely influenced by the &lt;a href=\"centuriation\"&gt;centuriation&lt;/a&gt;; this, according to Lugli, was the path of the Appian Way. This path, as well as the part located in today's &lt;a href=\"Apulia\"&gt;Apulia&lt;/a&gt; region, was still in use in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. A further piece of evidence for Lugli's proposed path is the presence of a number of archaeological remains in that region, among them the ancient settlement of Jesce.\nBy studying the distances given in the &lt;a href=\"Antonine%20Itinerary\"&gt;Antonine Itinerary&lt;/a&gt;, Lugli also assigned the Appian Way stations \"Blera\" and \"Sublupatia\" (which also occurs on the \"&lt;a href=\"Tabula%20Peutingeriana\"&gt;Tabula Peutingeriana&lt;/a&gt;\") respectively to the areas \"Murgia Catena\" and \"Taverna\" (between masseria (estate farmhouse) S. Filippo and masseria S. Pietro). However, the toponym \"Murgia Catena\" defined too large an area, so that it didn't allow a clear localization of the Appian Way station. Recently Luciano Piepoli, based on the distances given in the &lt;a href=\"Antonine%20Itinerary\"&gt;Antonine Itinerary&lt;/a&gt; and on recent archeological findings, has suggested that \"Silvium\" should be \"Santo Staso\", an area very close to &lt;a href=\"Gravina%20in%20Puglia\"&gt;Gravina in Puglia&lt;/a&gt;, \"Blera\" should be \"masseria Castello\", and \"Sublupatia\" should be \"masseria Caione\".\nExtension by Trajan.\nThe emperor &lt;a href=\"Trajan\"&gt;Trajan&lt;/a&gt; built the &lt;a href=\"Via%20Traiana\"&gt;Via Traiana&lt;/a&gt;, an extension of the Via Appia from Beneventum, reaching Brundisium via &lt;a href=\"Canusium\"&gt;Canusium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bari\"&gt;Bari&lt;/a&gt;um rather than via Tarentum. This was commemorated by an arch at Beneventum.\nTravellers could cross the &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Otranto\"&gt;Otranto Strait&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt; either by landing at present day &lt;a href=\"Durr%C3%ABs\"&gt;Durr\u00ebs&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Via%20Egnatia\"&gt;Via Egnatia&lt;/a&gt; or near the ancient town of &lt;a href=\"Apollonia%20%28Illyria%29\"&gt;Apollonia&lt;/a&gt; and continue towards present day &lt;a href=\"Rrogozhina\"&gt;Rrogozhina&lt;/a&gt; in central Albania.\nNotable historical events along the road.\nThe crucifixion of Spartacus' army.\nIn 73\u00a0BC, a slave revolt (known as the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Servile%20War\"&gt;Third Servile War&lt;/a&gt;) under the ex-gladiator of Capua, &lt;a href=\"Spartacus\"&gt;Spartacus&lt;/a&gt;, began against the Romans. Slavery accounted for roughly every third person in Italy.\nSpartacus defeated many Roman armies in a conflict that lasted for over two years. While trying to escape from Italy at &lt;a href=\"Brundisium\"&gt;Brundisium&lt;/a&gt; he unwittingly moved his forces into the historic trap at &lt;a href=\"Apulia\"&gt;Apulia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Calabria\"&gt;Calabria&lt;/a&gt;. The Romans were well acquainted with the region. Legions were brought home from abroad and Spartacus was pinned between armies. The ex-slave army was defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Siler%20River\"&gt;Siler River&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus\"&gt;Marcus Licinius Crassus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pompey\"&gt;Pompey&lt;/a&gt;'s armies captured and killed several thousand rebels that escaped from the battle and Crassus captured several thousand more. The Romans judged that the slaves had forfeited their right to live. In 71\u00a0BC, 6,000 slaves were &lt;a href=\"crucifixion\"&gt;crucified&lt;/a&gt; along the Via Appia from Rome to Capua.\nThe World War II Battle of Anzio.\nIn 1943, during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allies&lt;/a&gt; fell into the same trap Pyrrhus had retreated to avoid, in the &lt;a href=\"Pontine%20Marshes\"&gt;Pomptine fields&lt;/a&gt;, the successor to the &lt;a href=\"Pomptine%20Marshes\"&gt;Pomptine marshes&lt;/a&gt;. The marsh remained, despite many efforts to drain it, until engineers working for &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Mussolini\"&gt;Benito Mussolini&lt;/a&gt; finally succeeded. (Even so, the fields were infested with &lt;a href=\"malaria\"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;l &lt;a href=\"mosquitos\"&gt;mosquitos&lt;/a&gt; until the advent of &lt;a href=\"DDT\"&gt;DDT&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s.)\nHoping to break a stalemate at &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Cassino\"&gt;Monte Cassino&lt;/a&gt;, the Allies landed on the coast of Italy at &lt;a href=\"Nettuno\"&gt;Nettuno&lt;/a&gt;, ancient Antium, which was midway between &lt;a href=\"Ostia%20Antica%20%28archaeological%20site%29\"&gt;Ostia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terracina\"&gt;Terracina&lt;/a&gt;. They found that the place was undefended. They intended to move along the line of the Via Appia to take Rome, outflanking &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Cassino\"&gt;Monte Cassino&lt;/a&gt;, but they did not do so quickly enough. The Germans occupied Mounts Laziali and Lepini along the track of the old Via Latina, from which they rained down shells on Anzio. Even though the Allies expanded into all the Pomptine region, they gained no ground. The Germans counterattacked down the via Appia from the Alban hills in a front four miles wide, but could not retake Anzio. The battle lasted for four months, one side being supplied by sea, the other by land through Rome. In May 1944, the Allies broke out of Anzio and took &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;. The German forces escaped to the north of &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;.\n1960 Summer Olympics.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"1960%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1960 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, it served as part of the &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20at%20the%201960%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;men's marathon&lt;/a&gt; course that was won by &lt;a href=\"Abebe%20Bikila\"&gt;Abebe Bikila&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia%20at%20the%201960%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;.\nMain sights.\nVia Appia antica.\nAfter the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Western Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the road fell out of use; &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20VI\"&gt;Pope Pius VI&lt;/a&gt; ordered its restoration. A new Appian Way was built in parallel with the old one in 1784 as far as the Alban Hills region. The new road is the \"Via Appia Nuova\" (\"New Appian Way\") as opposed to the old section, now known as \"Via Appia Antica\". The old Appian Way close to Rome is now a free tourist attraction. It was extensively restored for Rome's &lt;a href=\"Millennium\"&gt;Millennium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Jubilee\"&gt;Great Jubilee&lt;/a&gt; celebrations. The first are still heavily used by cars, buses and coaches but from then on traffic is very light and the ruins can be explored on foot in relative safety. The &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Domine%20Quo%20Vadis\"&gt;Church of Domine Quo Vadis&lt;/a&gt; is in the second mile of the road. Along or close to the part of the road closest to Rome, there are three &lt;a href=\"catacombs\"&gt;catacombs&lt;/a&gt; of Roman and early &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; origin and one of &lt;a href=\"Vigna%20Randanini\"&gt;Jewish origin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe construction of Rome's ring road, the &lt;a href=\"Grande%20Raccordo%20Anulare\"&gt;Grande Raccordo Anulare&lt;/a&gt; or GRA, in 1951 caused the Appian Way to be cut in two. More recent improvements to the GRA have rectified this through the construction of a tunnel under the Appia, so that it is now possible to follow the Appia on foot for about from its beginning near the &lt;a href=\"Baths%20of%20Caracalla\"&gt;Baths of Caracalla&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany parts of the original road beyond Rome's environs have been preserved, and some are now used by cars (for example, in the area of &lt;a href=\"Velletri\"&gt;Velletri&lt;/a&gt;). The road inspires the last movement of &lt;a href=\"Ottorino%20Respighi\"&gt;Ottorino Respighi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Pini%20di%20Roma\"&gt;Pini di Roma&lt;/a&gt;\". To this day the Via Appia contains the longest stretch of straight road in Europe, totaling .\nMonuments along the Via Appia.\nRoman bridges along the road.\nThere are the remains of several Roman bridges along the road, including the Ponte di Tre Ponti, Ponte di Vigna Capoccio, Viadotta di Valle Ariccia, Ponte Alto and Ponte Antico."
