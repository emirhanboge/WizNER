    "text": "Hal Browne is an Australian former &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; footballer who played in the 1960s and 1970s. He played for &lt;a href=\"Balmain%20Tigers\"&gt;Balmain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;New South Wales Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; (NSWRL) competition.\nPlaying career.\nBrowne made his first grade debut for Balmain in 1964. Browne did not feature in any of Balmain's finals games that year and subsequent grand final appearance against &lt;a href=\"St%20George%20Dragons\"&gt;St George&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 1966, Balmain would again reach the grand final against the all conquering St George side. Browne was not selected to play in the decider as St George defeated Balmain claiming their 11th straight premiership.\nIn 1969, Balmain finished second on the table and reached the grand final after defeating &lt;a href=\"Manly-Warringah%20Sea%20Eagles\"&gt;Manly-Warringah&lt;/a&gt; in the preliminary final. Balmain's opponents in the grand final were &lt;a href=\"South%20Sydney%20Rabbitohs\"&gt;South Sydney&lt;/a&gt; who went into the game as favourites over Balmain. \nBrowne missed the game through injury as Balmain won their 11th and final premiership 11-2 in a shock win. The grand final is best remembered for Balmain's tactics as Souths had accused them of laying down and feigning injury. In 2017, Browne spoke about the final saying \"At training on the Tuesday night, Nosa said, \u2018This is what we\u2019re going to do \u2014 every time they get a roll-on, one of you go down hurt. I don\u2019t care who it is, just go down hurt on the ground. We\u2019ve got to play them at our pace, not at their pace.\u2019 So we did it and it worked\".\nThe following season in 1970, Balmain were unable to defend their premiership and finished a disappointing 6th place on the table. Browne retired following the conclusion of the 1970 season."
