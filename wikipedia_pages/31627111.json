The club moved again, to the western fields in 2006, which is where they still are today.\nCompetitions.\nThe 1992 Kawana side was coached by Ken Mclean, and after a successful season finished the league in third spot behind the dominant teams in the early 1990s of Buderim and Beegees.\nIt took until 1997 for Kawana to make their next grand final. Between 1997 and 2006 Kawana went on to win five Premierships, six league titles, three cups and three charity shields.
