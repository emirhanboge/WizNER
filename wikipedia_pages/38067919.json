    "text": "The Harz (Lower Saxony) Nature Park () or just Harz Nature Park lies in the districts of &lt;a href=\"Goslar%20%28district%29\"&gt;Goslar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6ttingen%20%28district%29\"&gt;G\u00f6ttingen&lt;/a&gt; (in the area of the former &lt;a href=\"Osterode%20am%20Harz%20%28district%29\"&gt;Osterode am Harz&lt;/a&gt; district) in &lt;a href=\"South%20Lower%20Saxony\"&gt;South Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt;. The nature park in the &lt;a href=\"Harz%20Mountains\"&gt;Harz Mountains&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1960 and is covers an area of around 790\u00a0km\u00b2. It is run by the &lt;a href=\"Harz%20Regional%20Association\"&gt;Harz Regional Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe nature park includes the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Harz\"&gt;Upper Harz&lt;/a&gt; minus the Lower Saxon parts of the &lt;a href=\"Harz%20National%20Park\"&gt;Harz National Park&lt;/a&gt;. Its eastern and southeaster boundary is part of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Green%20Belt\"&gt;German Green Belt&lt;/a&gt;. It borders on the &lt;a href=\"Harz/Saxony-Anhalt%20Nature%20Park\"&gt;Harz/Saxony-Anhalt Nature Park&lt;/a&gt; to the east and the &lt;a href=\"South%20Harz%20Nature%20Park\"&gt;South Harz Nature Park&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast, the entire Harz being a single, large protected area (\"Gro\u00dfschutzgebiet\").\nIn the Harz and thus in the nature park, which is characterised by a rich variety of &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;, are extensive forests, plateaus that are partly used by agriculture, deeply incised valleys with wild river courses and waterfalls, as well as &lt;a href=\"storage%20pond\"&gt;storage pond&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"reservoir\"&gt;reservoir&lt;/a&gt;s. In many places there are signs of a long history of settlement. In addition, there are winter sports areas and the Harz as a whole is a major hiking area.\nThe highest point in the Harz Nature Park (Lower Saxony) is the &lt;a href=\"Wurmberg%20%28Harz%29\"&gt;Wurmberg&lt;/a&gt; ().\nExternal links.\n "
