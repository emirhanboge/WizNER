    "text": " is a Japanese professional racing driver. He participated in three &lt;a href=\"Formula%20One\"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; Grands Prix, d\u00e9buting in the &lt;a href=\"1994%20European%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;1994 European Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;, but did not score any championship points. He replaced &lt;a href=\"Yannick%20Dalmas\"&gt;Yannick Dalmas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Larrousse\"&gt;Larrousse&lt;/a&gt; car for the last three Grands Prix of the season, but failed to finish in any of the three races. In 1995, he joined &lt;a href=\"Simtek\"&gt;Simtek&lt;/a&gt; as a test driver, hoping to get some races in. However, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hanshin%20Earthquake\"&gt;Kobe earthquake&lt;/a&gt; and the folding of the Simtek team ended his brief career.\nA year later, Noda went to America and raced in the &lt;a href=\"Indy%20Lights\"&gt;Indy Lights&lt;/a&gt; and became the only Japanese driver to win a CART-sanctioned event. After a few years in America, Noda moved back to Japan, where he drove a Team Cerumo Toyota Supra with &lt;a href=\"Hironori%20Takeuchi\"&gt;Hironori Takeuchi&lt;/a&gt;. In the annual non-championship All-Star event at Aida, Noda and Takeuchi were forced out with mechanical problems. In 1999, he joined the Esso Tiger Team Le Mans under Koichiro Mori, again to drive a Toyota Supra, ex-Australian V8 Supercar driver &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Gardner\"&gt;Wayne Gardner&lt;/a&gt;. The highlight of their season was a win at Fuji. With 33 points they were equal 17th in the series.\nIn 2002, Noda returned to the United States and drove in six &lt;a href=\"Indy%20Racing%20League\"&gt;Indy Racing League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"IndyCar%20Series\"&gt;IndyCar Series&lt;/a&gt; races for &lt;a href=\"Convergent%20Racing\"&gt;Convergent Racing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indy%20Regency%20Racing\"&gt;Indy Regency Racing&lt;/a&gt; with a best finish of 10th at &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20International%20Raceway\"&gt;Phoenix International Raceway&lt;/a&gt; while with Convergent. He also competed in a round of the inaugural &lt;a href=\"A1%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;A1 Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; season with Japan at &lt;a href=\"Lausitz\"&gt;Lausitz&lt;/a&gt;, where he scored three points for the Japanese team. He has also been seen in the &lt;a href=\"Zytek\"&gt;Zytek&lt;/a&gt; sports-prototype in 2006.\nCareer.\nBefore Formula One.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Osaka\"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt;, Noda began his motor racing career through karting. In 1982 he competed in the Kansai Kart Land J-class category, where he was champion. He then took out the Japanese National A-1 class championship the next year, and won the Japanese National A-1 West Division series in 1985. Moving up to the A-2 class for 1986, Noda was Japanese champion again, before going to Japanese Formula Junior 1600 for 1987, where he won four times and was the top rookie.\nHe moved up into the highly competitive world of Japanese Formula Three in 1988. Driving for the JAX Racing Team in a Reynard 873 with a &lt;a href=\"Toyota\"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; engine, he came fifth as a 19-year-old in his very first race at &lt;a href=\"Suzuka%20Circuit\"&gt;Suzuka&lt;/a&gt;, and repeated the feat in round four, also at Suzuka. Those were his only two points-scoring finishes; a tally of four points; finishing equal 10th in the series.\nAfter then competing in the prestigious Macau Formula Three event at the end of 1988, and harbouring ambitions of Formula One, in 1989 Noda moved to Europe. He raced in both the British Vauxhall Lotus championship (where he came fifth overall with a win at &lt;a href=\"Donington%20Park\"&gt;Donington&lt;/a&gt; plus two third places, at Donington and &lt;a href=\"Mondello%20Park\"&gt;Mondello Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;), and in the GM Opel Lotus Euroseries, where he was ninth in the standings with second-place finishes at &lt;a href=\"Circuit%20Paul%20Ricard\"&gt;Paul Ricard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Circuit%20Park%20Zandvoort\"&gt;Zandvoort&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese exploits were impressive enough to land him a ride in British Formula 3 for 1990 with Alan Docking Racing in a Ralt RT34 Mugen. He scored eight points that season, placing 12th in a year dominated by &lt;a href=\"Mika%20H%C3%A4kkinen\"&gt;Mika H\u00e4kkinen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mika%20Salo\"&gt;Mika Salo&lt;/a&gt;, but he stayed with the same team for &lt;a href=\"1991%20British%20Formula%203%20season\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;. Upgrading to a Ralt RT35, Noda moved up to seventh overall, scoring 36 points, including a win at &lt;a href=\"Silverstone%20Circuit\"&gt;Silverstone&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first time that a Japanese driver had won a Formula Three race outside of his homeland.\nBy 1992 he was racing in Formula 3000 for the Mike Earle's 3001 International team in a Reynard 92D Mugen, but here he found the going much harder. In ten rounds he failed to qualify once, at &lt;a href=\"Hockenheimring\"&gt;Hockenheim&lt;/a&gt;, but when he did make it onto the grid he never reached higher than 21st. His first season was also marred by two accidents at &lt;a href=\"Circuit%20de%20Catalunya\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Autodromo%20di%20Pergusa\"&gt;Enna&lt;/a&gt;, although he became more reliable towards the end of the year, climaxing in an eighth-place finish at &lt;a href=\"Circuit%20de%20Nevers%20Magny-Cours\"&gt;Magny-Cours&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1993 Noda joined the TOM'S team in a Reynard 93D Cosworth, and although like in 1992 he failed to score any points, he managed to qualify in the top 20 a few times. He also did a good job of bringing the car home, a highlight being ninth at &lt;a href=\"Pau%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Pau&lt;/a&gt;. In Noda's third season in F3000, he switched to the Forti Corse team to drive a Reynard 94D Cosworth as teammate to &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Diniz\"&gt;Pedro Diniz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe pair did well at the &lt;a href=\"Silverstone%20Circuit\"&gt;Silverstone&lt;/a&gt; opener, Noda qualified fourth and Diniz started sixth, with Noda eventually finishing fifth and scoring his first Formula 3000 points. He then had a mid-season trot in which he qualified fifth, sixth and fifth respectively at Barcelona, Enna and Hockenheim, scoring a podium finish with third place at Enna. He ended the year in equal ninth spot with six points.\nFormula One.\nBy the end of 1994, though, Noda had landed a Formula One seat. Although his results had not been unimpressive, it was more by virtue of the sponsorship money he brought that he got himself into the financially troubled &lt;a href=\"Larrousse\"&gt;Larrousse&lt;/a&gt; team towards the end of the season. Still a relative unknown on the world stage, though, Noda himself was well aware of the fact that expectations of him were low. As he said himself: \"People think I'm useless.\"\nDespite the limitations of the Larrousse LH94 Ford HB V8 package. As teammate to &lt;a href=\"%C3%89rik%20Comas\"&gt;\u00c9rik Comas&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"1994%20European%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;1994 European Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at Jerez, there were fears that both he and fellow newcomer &lt;a href=\"Domenico%20Schiattarella\"&gt;Domenico Schiattarella&lt;/a&gt; would be so far off the pace that they would not beat &lt;a href=\"Bertrand%20Gachot\"&gt;Bertrand Gachot&lt;/a&gt;'s horrible Pacific to the last grid spot.\nSuch fears proved unfounded, as Noda qualified within a second of Comas' time, and was the 25th fastest. But when &lt;a href=\"David%20Brabham\"&gt;David Brabham&lt;/a&gt;'s best time in the &lt;a href=\"Simtek\"&gt;Simtek&lt;/a&gt; was disallowed, Noda was bumped up to 24th on the grid, alongside Comas in 23rd. But in another department, he had comprehensively thrashed his more experienced teammate. Under braking, he was pulling 4.1g, a Larrousse record, whereas Comas often pulled less than 3g. It showed how quickly he had got the hang of powerful Formula One brakes.\nIn the race, he stalled on the grid, the same as his countryman, &lt;a href=\"Ukyo%20Katayama\"&gt;Ukyo Katayama&lt;/a&gt;. Both were push-started on their way, but while Katayama proceeded to storm back through the field to finish in seventh, Noda could do no more than tour at the back. That he only did for 10 laps, before he suffered a terminal gearbox problem and began limping back to the pits.\nYet as he did so, the front-running pair of &lt;a href=\"Rubens%20Barrichello\"&gt;Rubens Barrichello&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Mansell\"&gt;Nigel Mansell&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"WilliamsF1\"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt; came up to lap him. Noda was a touch too slow in getting out of the way, and both Barrichello and Mansell had to guess which side to pass. Rubens pulled to the right and safely negotiated his way around the Larrousse, but all Nigel could do was lock his brakes and ram the back of the Japanese driver.\nNoda pulled in to retire, and Mansell eventually had to come in for a new nose cone, ruining his race and denting his reputation. Noda's luck would then get no better at his home race in &lt;a href=\"1994%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, where he qualified 23rd, once again only one spot off Comas, although this time he was only 0.013s behind the Frenchman. His experience at Suzuka was obviously paying rich dividends, but when torrential rain drenched the circuit on race day, it would suddenly be a whole new ball game.\nThe opening laps saw cars slide off the circuit, but he would never get the choice to join the chaos, as his fuel injection system failed on the very first lap. In fact the entire Japanese contingent suffered a dreadful race, especially when both Katayama and rookie &lt;a href=\"Taki%20Inoue\"&gt;Taki Inoue&lt;/a&gt; then aquaplaned into the pit wall at the end of lap three in separate incidents. Within the first few minutes all the local heroes were out of the race.\nThe last race in &lt;a href=\"1994%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; was little better. By now Comas had gone, replaced by Swiss &lt;a href=\"pay%20driver\"&gt;pay driver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jean-Denis%20D%C3%A9l%C3%A9traz\"&gt;Jean-Denis D\u00e9l\u00e9traz&lt;/a&gt;. Noda out-qualified his teammate by two grid positions and almost 2.3 seconds. From 23rd on the grid, he was passed off the line by the Simteks of Brabham and Schiattarella, and he trailed around in second-last spot for 18 laps before an oil leak brought his race to a premature end once again.\nStill, in his three outings he had done a respectable enough job, and he was thought to have been in the frame for a few Formula One seats come &lt;a href=\"1995%20Formula%20One%20season\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;. As it turned out, &lt;a href=\"Larrousse\"&gt;Larrousse&lt;/a&gt; folded, and the only deal that came his way was to drive the &lt;a href=\"Simtek\"&gt;Simtek&lt;/a&gt; in the second half of 1995 as &lt;a href=\"Jos%20Verstappen\"&gt;Jos Verstappen&lt;/a&gt;'s teammate, with Schiattarella racing in the first half of the year. Even so, the deposit Noda paid for the seat and the money he was going to bring to the team was of massive importance to the cash-strapped operation.\nHowever, things quickly turned sour. Although he watched the first few races of the 1995 season with envy as &lt;a href=\"Jos%20Verstappen\"&gt;Jos Verstappen&lt;/a&gt; and Schiattarella demonstrated the promise of the new car, the truth was that his funds had taken a battering after the devastating &lt;a href=\"Kobe%20earthquake\"&gt;Kobe earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. It contributed to &lt;a href=\"Simtek\"&gt;Simtek&lt;/a&gt;'s mounting financial problems, resulting in the team's closure after &lt;a href=\"1995%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;. Noda never even got to drive the car; he was forced to forfeit his deposit and the rest of his 1995 went up in smoke. The &lt;a href=\"Forti\"&gt;Forti&lt;/a&gt; team attempted to enter him in the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Pacific%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;1995 Pacific Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; in place of &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Moreno\"&gt;Roberto Moreno&lt;/a&gt;, but he was denied an &lt;a href=\"FIA%20Super%20Licence\"&gt;FIA Super Licence&lt;/a&gt; despite his previous experience. He was also considered for a drive at the team in , but the seat went to &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Badoer\"&gt;Luca Badoer&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nAfter Formula One.\nAmerican Open Wheelers (1996\u20131997).\nWith that, Noda was out of the picture as far as Formula One was concerned, so for 1996 he went across the Atlantic to try his luck in &lt;a href=\"Indy%20Lights\"&gt;Indy Lights&lt;/a&gt; in America. Adapting quickly, he finished third on the streets of Toronto in his first year, and in 1997 continued in the same category, driving a Lola T97/20 for the &lt;a href=\"Indy%20Regency%20Racing\"&gt;Indy Regency Racing&lt;/a&gt; as teammate to Mexican driver &lt;a href=\"Rodolfo%20Lavin\"&gt;Rodolfo Lavin&lt;/a&gt;.\n1997 was actually a very competitive year in &lt;a href=\"Indy%20Lights\"&gt;Indy Lights&lt;/a&gt;, with future CART drivers: &lt;a href=\"Cristiano%20da%20Matta\"&gt;Cristiano da Matta&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Kanaan\"&gt;Tony Kanaan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A9lio%20Castroneves\"&gt;H\u00e9lio Castroneves&lt;/a&gt; all racing for leading teams. Noda was also not the only Japanese driver in the entry lists, with ex-Formula One driver, &lt;a href=\"Naoki%20Hattori\"&gt;Naoki Hattori&lt;/a&gt; and the unrelated &lt;a href=\"Shigeaki%20Hattori\"&gt;Shigeaki Hattori&lt;/a&gt; also in the field. In the end Castroneves and da Matta took three wins each, but despite only taking one victory Kanaan's consistency won him the series. Noda was ninth with 51 points.\nThough he was usually a midfield runner, he did qualify second and finish third on the &lt;a href=\"Molson%20Indy%20Vancouver\"&gt;streets of Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, but it was at &lt;a href=\"Portland%20International%20Raceway\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; where he had his fifteen minutes of fame. There he also started from second on the grid, but come race day it rained and Noda could put his European experience to good use. After dicing with Castroneves for most of the race, he passed the Brazilian on lap 22 for the lead, and when the race was stopped after 29 laps, Noda was declared the winner.\nIt was the first, and to this point, only time a Japanese driver has won a CART-sanctioned event. Those seven laps in front were the only ones Noda led all year. Despite his winning performance, he was never on the Champ Car shopping lists, and by 1998 the American adventure was looking a bit like a dead end.\nBack To Japan (1998\u20132001).\nIn 1998 he returned to Japan, and in the four seasons since has had parallel careers in &lt;a href=\"Formula%20Nippon\"&gt;Formula Nippon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20GT%20Championship\"&gt;Japanese GT Championship&lt;/a&gt;. In the latter he drove a Team Cerumo Toyota Supra in 1998 with &lt;a href=\"Hironori%20Takeuchi\"&gt;Hironori Takeuchi&lt;/a&gt;, finishing fifth at Motegi and third at Sugo, scoring 22 points for equal 21st overall. The season was marred, though, by the abandonment of the Fuji round due to fog, and in the annual non-championship All-Star event at Aida, Noda and Takeuchi were forced out with mechanical problems.\nIn 1999 he joined the Esso Tiger Team Le Mans under Koichiro Mori, again to drive a Toyota Supra, this time alongside ex-500\u00a0cc motorcycle World Champion and Australian V8 Supercar driver &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Gardner\"&gt;Wayne Gardner&lt;/a&gt;. In truth it was an inconsistent season, with several rather average results offset by fastest lap at Sugo (despite a retirement), fifth at both Mine and the non-championship Fuji 1000\u00a0km, and, in the highlight of their season, a fine win plus fastest lap for Noda at Fuji. With 33 points they were equal 17th in the series.\nThe combination of Noda, Gardner and the Esso Le Mans am remained the same for 2000, and this time consistency was their key, finishing six of the seven races in the top 10, with an eighth at Motegi, seventh places at Sugo and Aida, sixth at Suzuka, fifth at Mine and fourth at Fuji. However, they were unable to make it onto the podium, and with 35 points they could only rank equal 14th overall. Also, at the All-Star event held at Sepang, Noda and Gardner took ninth place, albeit a lap down.\nNoda also competed in the &lt;a href=\"Formula%20Nippon\"&gt;Formula Nippon&lt;/a&gt; series from 1998 to 2001. In 1998 he drove for the Cosmo Oil Racing Team in the standard Lola T98/51 chassis with the obligatory Mugen engine, but apart from a third at Sugo and a smattering of fifths and sixths, there were also three spin-outs at Mine and Suzuka, the first of which Noda crashed twice. With nine points he could only manage 10th overall.\nIn 1999 he switched to the Be Brides Impul team. Starting the season in a Lola B99/51 Mugen, he could not break into the top ten in either qualifying or races, and in midstream the team changed to a Reynard 99L chassis. This brought about an upturn in fortunes, and towards the end of the year Noda recorded a sixth at Suzuka, second at Mine and ninth at Motegi, and with seven points ended up in 11th position.\nA full season in a Reynard 99L Mugen for the Le Mans team in 2000 saw Noda jump up to fifth place with 15 points, with a sixth at Fuji, fifths at Suzuka and Motegi, third at Mine and second at Suzuka. But this was very little compared to another ex-Formula One driver, &lt;a href=\"Toranosuke%20Takagi\"&gt;Toranosuke Takagi&lt;/a&gt;, who won eight of the ten rounds for the Nakajima team, scoring a mammoth 86 points to second-placed Michael Krumm's 34.\nAfter the improvement of 2000, though, in 2001 Noda joined the DoCoMo Dandelion Racing team, piloting a Reynard 2KL Mugen. In an ambitious operation, the team also ran an older Reynard 99L for one-time Benetton test driver Hidetoshi Mitsusada and Polish racer Jaroslav Wierczuk. It was probably too much for the outfit, and it showed as Noda failed to score any points at all, retiring from six of the 10 rounds, despite a best qualifying effort of 3rd at Motegi.\nNoda returned to the United States in 2002 and drove in six &lt;a href=\"Indy%20Racing%20League\"&gt;Indy Racing League&lt;/a&gt; races for Convergent Racing and &lt;a href=\"Indy%20Regency%20Racing\"&gt;Indy Regency Racing&lt;/a&gt; (whom Noda drove for in Indy Lights) with a best finish of 10th at &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20International%20Raceway\"&gt;Phoenix International Raceway&lt;/a&gt; while with Convergent.\nA1 Grand Prix (2005\u20132009).\nIn 2005, Noda was announced as the second driver for the &lt;a href=\"A1%20Team%20Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; entry for the &lt;a href=\"2005-06%20A1%20Grand%20Prix%20season\"&gt;2005-06 A1 Grand Prix season&lt;/a&gt;, second to &lt;a href=\"Ryo%20Fukuda\"&gt;Ryo Fukuda&lt;/a&gt;. His first race for the team came at the &lt;a href=\"2005-06%20A1%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20Nations%2C%20Germany\"&gt;second round&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"EuroSpeedway%20Lausitz\"&gt;Lausitz&lt;/a&gt;, where he qualified in 21st place. In sprint race, Noda managed to move up 11 places to finish 10th and score one point for Japan. The feature race saw Noda finish one place higher in ninth place, scoring a further two points for the Japanese A1 GP team. Japan finished 21st at the end of the season, with eight points.\nPersonal life.\nNoda's daughter Juju Noda is also a racing driver and made her d\u00e9but in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20F4%20Danish%20Championship\"&gt;F4 Danish Championship&lt;/a&gt; in June 2020, winning from pole. She would finish the season 6th overall.\nReferences.\nAll Formula One race and championship results are taken from:\nAll IRL race and championship results are taken from:"
