    "text": "Heyrovsky is a small &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20craters\"&gt;lunar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"impact%20crater\"&gt;impact crater&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Far%20side%20%28Moon%29\"&gt;far side&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;. This crater lies just beyond the southwestern limb, in an area of the surface that is sometimes brought into view of the &lt;a href=\"Earth\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; during periods of favorable &lt;a href=\"libration\"&gt;libration&lt;/a&gt; and illumination by &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;light. It lies within the southern part of the wide skirt of ejecta that surrounds the &lt;a href=\"Mare%20Imbrium\"&gt;Mare Imbrium&lt;/a&gt; impact basin.\nThis is a circular crater formation with an interior that is shaped like a bowl. The inner walls are simple in structure, and slope straight town to the small interior floor at the midpoint. The crater interior has a generally higher &lt;a href=\"albedo\"&gt;albedo&lt;/a&gt; than its surroundings, giving it a somewhat brighter appearance."
