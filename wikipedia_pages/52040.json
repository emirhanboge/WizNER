    "text": "Oldsmobile was a &lt;a href=\"brand\"&gt;brand&lt;/a&gt; of American &lt;a href=\"automobile\"&gt;automobile&lt;/a&gt;s, produced for most of its existence by &lt;a href=\"General%20Motors\"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;. Originally established as \"Olds Motor Vehicle Company\" by &lt;a href=\"Ransom%20E.%20Olds\"&gt;Ransom E. Olds&lt;/a&gt; in 1897, it produced over 35 million vehicles, including at least 14 million built at its &lt;a href=\"Lansing%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Lansing, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; factory alone. During its time as a division of General Motors, Oldsmobile slotted into the middle of GM's five (passenger car) divisions (above &lt;a href=\"Chevrolet\"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pontiac%20%28automobile%29\"&gt;Pontiac&lt;/a&gt;, but below &lt;a href=\"Buick\"&gt;Buick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cadillac\"&gt;Cadillac&lt;/a&gt;), and was noted for several groundbreaking technologies and designs.\nOldsmobile's sales peaked at over one million annually from 1983-1986, but by the 1990s the division faced growing competition from premium import brands and sales steadily declined. When shut down in 2004, Oldsmobile was the oldest surviving American automobile &lt;a href=\"marque\"&gt;marque&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the oldest in the world, after &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz\"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peugeot\"&gt;Peugeot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renault\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fiat\"&gt;Fiat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Opel\"&gt;Opel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tatra%20%28company%29\"&gt;Tatra&lt;/a&gt; (initially Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau co.).\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nOldsmobiles were first manufactured by the Olds Motor Vehicle Co. in &lt;a href=\"Lansing%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Lansing, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, a company founded by &lt;a href=\"Ransom%20E.%20Olds\"&gt;Ransom E. Olds&lt;/a&gt; in 1897. In 1901 (the same year that &lt;a href=\"Horace%20Elgin%20Dodge\"&gt;Horace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Francis%20Dodge\"&gt;John Dodge&lt;/a&gt; won a contract to produce transmissions for the Oldsmobile company), the company produced 635 cars, making it the first high-volume gasoline-powered automobile manufacturer. (Electric car manufacturers such as &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Electric\"&gt;Columbia Electric&lt;/a&gt; and steam-powered car manufacturers such as &lt;a href=\"Locomobile%20Company%20of%20America\"&gt;Locomobile&lt;/a&gt; had higher volumes a few years earlier.) Oldsmobile became the top-selling car company in the United States for a few years around 1903\u20131904. Ransom Olds left the company in 1904 because of a dispute with sales manager Frederick Smith, who was questioning production techniques and wanted Mr. Olds to certify that each car that left the plant was free from defects. Mr. Smith then set up an experimental engineering shop without Mr. Olds' knowledge or consent, causing Mr. Olds to leave in 1904 and formed the &lt;a href=\"REO%20Motor%20Car%20Company\"&gt;REO Motor Car Company&lt;/a&gt;. This was a similar situation &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Ford\"&gt;Henry Ford&lt;/a&gt; encountered when he was forced out of the company he founded, the &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Ford%20Company\"&gt;Henry Ford Company&lt;/a&gt; and started the &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Motor%20Company\"&gt;Ford Motor Company&lt;/a&gt; in 1903. After merging with &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20T\"&gt;Diamond T&lt;/a&gt; in 1967, &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Reo%20Trucks\"&gt;Diamond Reo Trucks&lt;/a&gt; also lasted into the 21st century, folding in 2013.\nThe 1902 to 1907 &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Curved%20Dash\"&gt;Oldsmobile Model R \"Curved Dash\"&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20automotive%20superlatives\"&gt;the first mass-produced car&lt;/a&gt;, made from the first automotive &lt;a href=\"assembly%20line\"&gt;assembly line&lt;/a&gt;, an invention which is often incorrectly credited to Henry Ford and the Ford Motor Company. Ford was the first to manufacture cars on a \"moving\" assembly line, while Olds used a stationary assembly line, meaning that the assembled vehicle remained in one place and workers would move from one car to the next and perform one assigned task. This differed from hand-made vehicles in the past where various workers would work on one car until it was completed and was labor- and time-intensive. After Olds merged Olds Motor Vehicle Co. with the Olds Gas Engine Works in 1899, it was renamed \"Olds Motor Works\" and moved to a new plant in Detroit, located at the corner of East Jefferson Avenue and &lt;a href=\"MacArthur%20Bridge%20%28Detroit%29\"&gt;MacArthur Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. By March 1901, the company had a whole line of models ready for mass production. However, a mistake by a worker caused the factory to catch fire, and it burned to the ground, with all of the prototypes destroyed. The only car that survived the fire was a Curved Dash prototype, which was wheeled out of the factory by two workers while escaping the fire. While the factory was being rebuilt from insurance, many subcontractors were used to keep production going, to include &lt;a href=\"Henry%20M.%20Leland\"&gt;Henry M. Leland&lt;/a&gt; for engines and the &lt;a href=\"Dodge%20Brothers\"&gt;Dodge Brothers&lt;/a&gt;. Olds was a strong competitor to other independent companies &lt;a href=\"Buick\"&gt;Buick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cadillac\"&gt;Cadillac&lt;/a&gt; before they became divisions of &lt;a href=\"General%20Motors\"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; between 1908 and 1909. Later after Mr. Olds left the company, Oldsmobile production was moved to &lt;a href=\"Lansing%20Car%20Assembly\"&gt;Lansing&lt;/a&gt;.\nOfficially, the cars were called \"Olds automobiles,\" but were colloquially referred to as \"Oldsmobiles.\" It was this moniker, as applied especially to the Curved Dash Olds, that was popularized in the lyrics and title of the 1905 hit song \"&lt;a href=\"In%20My%20Merry%20Oldsmobile\"&gt;In My Merry Oldsmobile&lt;/a&gt;\". The last Oldsmobile Curved Dash was made in 1907. &lt;a href=\"General%20Motors%20Corporation\"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; purchased the company on November 12, 1908. When GM assumed operations, platform sharing began with Buick products and Oldsmobile shared platforms were identified with the prefix \"Series\" followed by a number, while models developed by pre-GM engineers were identified with the prefix \"Model\" followed by a letter. Early on, Oldsmobile was a competitor to &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20Motor%20Car%20Company\"&gt;Hudson&lt;/a&gt; as some former engineers of Oldsmobile took positions with Hudson.\n1910s.\nThe 1910 &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Limited\"&gt;Limited Touring Series 23&lt;/a&gt; was an early, ambitious, high point for the company. Riding atop 42-inch (1067\u00a0mm) wheels, and equipped with factory \"white\" tires, the Limited was the prestige model in Oldsmobile's two model lineup, with the smaller &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Series%2028\"&gt;Oldsmobile Autocrat Series 32&lt;/a&gt; having 36-inch wheels.\nThe Limited retailed for US$4,600, ($ in dollars ) an amount greater than the price of a new basic three-bedroom house. Buyers received goatskin upholstery, a 60\u00a0hp (45\u00a0kW) 707\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cubic%20inch%23Engine%20displacement\"&gt;CID&lt;/a&gt; (11.6\u00a0L) &lt;a href=\"T-head%20engine\"&gt;T-head&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"straight-six\"&gt;straight-six&lt;/a&gt; engine, Bosch Magneto starter, running boards and room for five. Options included a speedometer, clock, and a full glass windshield. A limousine version was priced at $5,800 ($ in dollars ). While Oldsmobile only sold 725 Limiteds in its three years of production, the car is best remembered for winning a race against the famed &lt;a href=\"20th%20Century%20Limited\"&gt;20th Century Limited&lt;/a&gt; train, an event immortalized in the painting \"Setting the Pace\" by William Hardner Foster.\nThe Limited was at the time considered technologically advanced and cutting edge, if on the expensive side, but it established the division's reputation for innovation. The &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Series%2040\"&gt;Oldsmobile Series 40&lt;/a&gt; was offered in 1912 and was considerably more affordable and smaller, and later the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Light%20Eight\"&gt;Oldsmobile Light Eight&lt;/a&gt; in 1916, Oldsmobile offered a Cadillac-sourced &lt;a href=\"Cadillac%20V8%20engine%23L-head\"&gt;flathead V8 engine&lt;/a&gt; until 1923, while Buick remained with their division exclusive &lt;a href=\"overhead%20valve\"&gt;overhead valve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buick%20Straight-6%20engine\"&gt;straight-six engine&lt;/a&gt; until 1930.\nBeginning in 1910, bodywork was supplied by &lt;a href=\"Fisher%20Body\"&gt;Fisher Body&lt;/a&gt;, a longstanding tradition that led to the company being eventually merged into GM in later years.\n1920s.\nIn 1926, the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Six\"&gt;Oldsmobile Six&lt;/a&gt; came in five body styles, and ushered in a new GM bodystyle platform called the \"&lt;a href=\"GM%20B%20platform\"&gt;GM B platform&lt;/a&gt;\", shared with &lt;a href=\"Buick\"&gt;Buick&lt;/a&gt; products.\nIn 1929, as part of &lt;a href=\"General%20Motors%20Companion%20Make%20Program\"&gt;General Motors' companion make program&lt;/a&gt;, Oldsmobile introduced the higher standard &lt;a href=\"Viking%20%28automobile%29\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt; brand, marketed through the Oldsmobile dealer network. Viking was already discontinued at the end of the 1930 model year although an additional 353 cars were marketed as 1931 models.\n1930s.\nIn the 1930s, Oldsmobile produced two body styles of automobile, the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20F-Series\"&gt;Series F&lt;/a&gt; (straight-6 cylinder) and the longer &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20L-Series\"&gt;Series L&lt;/a&gt; (straight-8 cylinder). In 1933 The \"&lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Program\"&gt;Oldsmobile Program&lt;/a&gt;\" appeared on CBS radio for two years which was a new advertising approach to sell products and services.\nIn 1937, Oldsmobile was a pioneer in introducing a four-speed semi-automatic transmission called the \"Automatic Safety Transmission\", although this accessory was actually built by Buick, which would offer it in its own cars in 1938. This transmission features a conventional &lt;a href=\"clutch\"&gt;clutch&lt;/a&gt; pedal, which the driver presses before selecting either \"low\" or \"high\" range. In \"low,\" the car shifts between first and second gears. In \"high,\" the car shifts among first, third and fourth gears.\n1940s.\nFor the 1940 model, Oldsmobile was the first auto manufacturer to offer a fully &lt;a href=\"automatic%20transmission\"&gt;automatic transmission&lt;/a&gt;, called the \"&lt;a href=\"Hydramatic\"&gt;Hydramatic&lt;/a&gt;\", which features four forward speeds. It has a gas pedal and a brake\u2014no clutch pedal. The gear selector is on the steering column.\nStarting in 1941 and continuing through 1999, Oldsmobile used a two-digit model designation. As originally implemented, the first digit signifies the body size while the second represents the number of cylinders. Body sizes were 6, 7, 8, and 9, and straight six- and straight eight-cylinder engines were offered. Thus, Oldsmobiles were named \"&lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%2066\"&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;\" through \"&lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%2098\"&gt;98&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe last pre-war Oldsmobile rolled off the assembly line on February 5, 1942. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Oldsmobile produced numerous kinds of material for the war effort, including large-caliber guns and shells. Production resumed on October 15, 1945, with a warmed-over 1942 model serving as the offering for 1946.\nOldsmobile once again was a pioneer when, for the 1949 model, the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20V8%20engine\"&gt;Rocket&lt;/a&gt; engine was introduced, which used an &lt;a href=\"overhead%20valve\"&gt;overhead valve&lt;/a&gt; V8 design rather than the &lt;a href=\"flathead%20engine\"&gt;flathead&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"straight-eight\"&gt;straight-eight&lt;/a&gt;\" design which prevailed at the time. The overhead valve was originally exclusive to Buick as they invented the technology and offered it on all of their products. This engine produced far more power than the other engines that were popular during that era, and found favor with hot-rodders and stock car racers. The basic design, with a few minor changes, endured until Oldsmobile redesigned its V8 engines in the mid-1960s.\n1950s.\nOldsmobile entered the 1950s following a divisional image campaign centered on its 'Rocket' engines and the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Race\"&gt;Space Race&lt;/a&gt;, and its cars' appearance followed suit. Oldsmobile's Rocket V8 engine was the leader in performance; its cars were generally considered the fastest on the market; and by the mid-1950s their styling was among the first to offer a wide, \"open maw\" grille, suggestive of fighter jet propulsion. From 1948-1957, Oldsmobile adopted a ringed-globe emblem depicting North America to stress what marketers felt was its universal appeal. Starting in 1958, the grille logo changed again to reflect the rocket image, that was used throughout the late 1950s, the make used twin jet pod-styled taillights as a nod to its \"Rocket\" theme. Oldsmobile was among the first of General Motors' divisions to receive a true &lt;a href=\"hardtop\"&gt;hardtop&lt;/a&gt; in 1950 called the \"Holiday coupe\" (Buick's version was called the \"Riviera\", and Cadillac's was called the \"Coupe De Ville\"), and it was also among the first divisions (along with Buick and Cadillac) to receive a wraparound windshield, a trend that eventually all American makes would share at sometime between 1953 and 1964. New for 1954 on 98 coupes and convertibles (Starfire) would be front and rear \"sweep cut\" fender styling, which would not show up on a Chevrolet until 1956 and not until 1957 on a Pontiac. 1953 models changed to a 12 volt electrical system that made starting easier.\nIn the 1950s the nomenclature changed again, and trim levels also received names that were then mated with the model numbers. This resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%2088\"&gt;Oldsmobile 88&lt;/a&gt; emerging as base &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Dynamic%2088\"&gt;Dynamic 88&lt;/a&gt; and the highline &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Super%2088\"&gt;Super 88&lt;/a&gt;. Other full-size model names included the \"Holiday\" used on hardtops, and \"Fiesta\" used on its station wagons. When the 88 was retired in 1999 (with a Fiftieth Anniversary Edition), its length of service was the longest model name used on American cars after the &lt;a href=\"Chrysler%20New%20Yorker\"&gt;Chrysler New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;. Mid-1955 also saw the introduction of the four-door Holiday pillarless hardtop, the industry's first (along with Buick).\nGeneral Motors' styling as a whole lost its frontrunner status in 1957 when Chrysler introduced &lt;a href=\"Virgil%20Exner\"&gt;Virgil Exner&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"forward%20look\"&gt;forward look&lt;/a&gt;\" designs. When compared side to side, Oldsmobile looked dated next to its price-point competitors &lt;a href=\"DeSoto%20%28automobile%29\"&gt;DeSoto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mercury%20%28automobile%29%231960s\"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;. Compounding the problem for Oldsmobile and Buick was a styling mistake which GM called the \"StratoRoof\", which was reminiscent of the \"greenhouse\" canopy used on the &lt;a href=\"Convair%20B-36%20Peacemaker\"&gt;Convair B-36 Peacemaker&lt;/a&gt; high altitude bomber. Both makes had models which contained the heavily framed rear window, but Detroit had been working with large curved backlights for almost a decade. Consumers disliked the roof and its blind spots, forcing GM to rush a redesign into production on some of its models. Oldsmobile's only off year in the 1950s was 1958. The nation was beginning to feel the results of its first significant post-war recession, and US automobile sales were down for the model year. Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac received a heavy-handed makeover of the 1957 GM designs. The Oldsmobile that emerged in 1958 bore little resemblance to the design of its forerunners; instead the car emerged as a large, over-decorated \"chromemobile\" which many felt had overly ostentatious styling.\nUp front, all 1958 Oldsmobile's received one of General Motors' heavily styled front facias and quad-headlights. Streaking back from the edge of the headlights was a broad belt consisting of two strips of chrome on regular 88s, three strips on Super 88s, and three strips (top and bottom thin, inside thick) on 98s that ended in a point at mid-body. The bottom of the rear fender featured a thick stamping of a half tube that pointed forward, atop which was a chrome assembly of four horizontal chrome speed-lines that terminated into a vertical bar. The tail of the car featured massive vertical chrome taillight housings. Two chrome stars were fitted to the trunklid.\nFord styling consultant &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Tremulis\"&gt;Alex Tremulis&lt;/a&gt; (designer of the &lt;a href=\"Tucker%2048\"&gt;1948 Tucker sedan&lt;/a&gt;) mocked the 1958 Oldsmobile by drawing cartoons of the car, and placing musical notes in the rear trim assembly. Another Detroit stylist employed by Ford bought a used 1958 Oldsmobile in the early 1960s, driving it daily to work. He detached and rearranged the \"Oldsmobile\" lettering above the grille to spell out \"slobmodel\" as a reminder to himself and co-workers of what \"bad\" auto design meant to their business.\nIn 1959, Oldsmobile models were completely redesigned with a rocket motif from front to rear, as the top of the front fenders had a chrome rocket, while the body-length fins were shaped as rocket exhausts which culminated in a fin-top taillight (concave on the 98 models while convex on the 88 models). The 1959 models also offered several roof treatments, such as the pillared sedan with a fastback rear window and the Holiday SportSedan, which was a flat-roofed pillarless hardtop with wraparound front and rear glass. The 1959 models were marketed as \"the linear look\", and also featured a bar-graph speedometer which showed a green indicator through , then changed to orange until , then was red above that until the highest speed read by the speedometer, . Power windows were available on the 98 models, as were two-speed electric windshield wipers with electrically powered windshield washers. The 88 still relied on vacuum-operated windshield wipers without a washer feature. 1959 Oldsmobiles were offered with \"Autronic Eye\" (a dashboard-mounted automatic headlight dimmer) as well as factory-installed air conditioning and power-operated front bench seat as available options. The 1959 body style was continued through the 1960 model year, but the fins were toned down for 1960 and the taillights were moved to the bottom of the fenders.\n1960s.\nNotable achievements for Oldsmobile in the 1960s included the introduction of the first &lt;a href=\"Turbocharger\"&gt;turbocharged&lt;/a&gt; engine and a factory &lt;a href=\"Water%20injection%20%28engine%29\"&gt;water injection&lt;/a&gt; system in 1962 (the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20V8%20engine%23Turbo%20Jetfire\"&gt;Turbo Jetfire&lt;/a&gt;), the first modern &lt;a href=\"front-wheel%20drive\"&gt;front-wheel drive&lt;/a&gt; car produced in the United States (the 1966 &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Toronado\"&gt;Toronado&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Vista%20Cruiser\"&gt;Vista Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; station wagon (noted for its roof glass), and the upscale &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20442\"&gt;442&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"muscle%20car\"&gt;muscle car&lt;/a&gt;. Olds briefly used the names \"Jetstar 88\" (1964\u20131966) and &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%2088%23Sixth%20generation%20%281965%E2%80%931970%29\"&gt;Delmont 88&lt;/a&gt; (1967\u20131968) on its least expensive full-size models in the 1960s. In 1968 the split grille appearance was introduced and remained a traditional feature until production ended in 2004.\nNotable models for the 1960s:\n1970s-1980s.\nThe 1970s and 1980s were good years for the Oldsmobile division; sales soared (reaching an all-time high of 1,066,122 in 1985) based on popular designs, positive reviews from critics, and perceived quality and reliability, with the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Cutlass\"&gt;Cutlass&lt;/a&gt; series becoming North America's top-selling car by 1976. By this time, Olds had displaced Pontiac and Plymouth as the third best-selling brand in the U.S. behind Chevrolet and Ford. In the late 1970s and again in the mid-1980s, model-year production topped one million units, something only Chevrolet and Ford had achieved.\nThe very popularity of Oldsmobile's cars created a problem for the division in the late 1970s, however. At that time, each General Motors division produced its own V8 engines, and in 1977, Oldsmobile, Chevrolet, Pontiac, and Buick each produced a unique 350-cubic-inch displacement V8. It was during the 1977 model year that demand exceeded production capacity for the Oldsmobile V8 and as a result, Oldsmobile began equipping most full-size Delta 88 models (those with Federal emissions specifications) with the Chevrolet 350 engine instead. Although it was widely debated whether there was a difference in quality or performance between the two engines, there was no question that the engines were different from one another. Many customers were loyal Oldsmobile buyers who specifically wanted the Rocket V8, and did not discover that their vehicle had the Chevrolet engine until they performed maintenance and discovered that purchased parts did not fit. This became a &lt;a href=\"public%20relations\"&gt;public relations&lt;/a&gt; nightmare for GM.\nFollowing this debacle, disclaimers stating that \"Oldsmobiles are equipped with engines produced by various GM divisions\" were tacked onto advertisements and sales literature; all other GM divisions followed suit. In addition, GM quickly stopped associating engines with particular divisions and to this day, all GM engines are produced by \"GM Powertrain\" (GMPT) and are called GM \"Corporate\" engines instead of GM \"Division\" engines. Although it was the popularity of the Oldsmobile division vehicles that prompted this change, declining sales of V8 engines would have made this change inevitable as all but the Chevrolet version of the 350-cubic-inch engine were eventually discontinued.\nOldsmobile also introduced a 5.7L (350 cu-in) V8 &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt; option on its Custom Cruiser, Delta 88 and 98 models in 1978; and a smaller 4.3L (260 cu-in) displacement V8 diesel on the 1979 Cutlass Salon and Cutlass Supreme/Cutlass Calais models. These were largely based on corresponding gasoline engines but with heavier duty cast blocks, redesigned heads and fast glow plugs; and on the 5.7L, oversized cranks, main bearings and wrist pins. There were several problems with these engines, including water and corrosion in the injectors (no water separator in the fuel line); paraffin clogging of fuel lines and filters in cold weather; reduced lubrication in the heads due to undersized oil galleys; head bolt failures; and the use of aluminum rockers and stanchions in the 4.3L V8 engines. While the 5.7L was also offered on various Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, and Pontiac models, it was eventually discontinued by all divisions in 1985. V6 diesels of 4.3L displacement were also offered between 1982 and 1985. In 1988 the then all-new 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Pace car was the 1st production car with &lt;a href=\"Automotive%20head-up%20display\"&gt;heads up display&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable models:\n1990s.\nAfter the tremendous success of the 1970s and 1980s, things changed quickly for Oldsmobile, and by the early 1990s the brand had lost its place in the market (as annual sales had fallen from a record high of 1,066,122 in 1985 to just 402,936 in 1993), squeezed between other GM divisions, and with competition from new upscale import makes &lt;a href=\"Acura\"&gt;Acura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Infiniti\"&gt;Infiniti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lexus\"&gt;Lexus&lt;/a&gt;. GM continued to use Oldsmobile sporadically to showcase futuristic designs and as a \"&lt;a href=\"guinea%20pig\"&gt;guinea pig&lt;/a&gt;\" for testing new technology, with Oldsmobile offering the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Toronado%23Fourth%20generation%20%281986%E2%80%931992%29\"&gt;Toronado Trofeo&lt;/a&gt;, which included a visual instrument system with a calendar, datebook, climate controls and several prototypes built in conjunction with Avis with an early satellite-based navigation system. For 1995, Oldsmobile introduced the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;, which would be the inspiration for the design of its cars from the mid-1990s onward. The introduction of the Aurora marked as General Motors' catalyst to reposition Oldsmobile as an upscale import fighter. Accordingly, Oldsmobile received a new logo based on the familiar \"rocket\" theme. Also in 1995 Oldsmobile introduced the first satellite navigation system available in the United States, the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%2088%23Oldsmobile%20Guidestar\"&gt;Guidestar&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%2088%23Tenth%20generation%20%281992%E2%80%931999%29\"&gt;1995 Oldsmobile 88&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly all the existing model names were gradually phased out: the Cutlass Calais in 1991, the Toronado and Custom Cruiser in 1992, the Ninety-Eight and Ciera (formerly Cutlass Ciera) in 1996, Cutlass Supreme in 1997, and finally the Eighty-Eight and Cutlass (which had only been around since '97) in 1999. They were replaced with newer, more modern models with designs inspired by the Aurora.\nRedesigned and new models introduced from 1990 to 2004:\n2000s.\nIn spite of Oldsmobile's critical successes since the mid-1990s, a reported shortfall in sales and overall profitability prompted &lt;a href=\"General%20Motors\"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; to announce in December 2000 its plans to shut down the Oldsmobile organization. That announcement was officially revealed two days after Oldsmobile distributed the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Bravada\"&gt;Bravada&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sport%20utility%20vehicle\"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 which became another critical hit for the division but turned out to be the final new model for the Oldsmobile brand.\nThe phaseout was conducted on the following schedule:\nThe last 500 Aleros, Auroras, Bravadas, Silhouettes and Intrigues produced received special Oldsmobile heritage emblems and markings which signified 'Final 500'. All featured a unique Dark Cherry Metallic paint scheme. Auroras and Intrigues would be accompanied by special Final 500 literature. However, only the Intrigue, Aurora, Bravada, and Alero had all Final 500 models built; the Silhouette only had 360 built as a result of the plant running out of out of production capacity due to fleet order obligations for minivans on the same assembly line. The Oldsmobile division's last completed production car was an Alero GLS 4-door sedan, which was signed by all of the Olds assembly line workers. It was on display at the &lt;a href=\"R.%20E.%20Olds%20Transportation%20Museum\"&gt;R. E. Olds Transportation Museum&lt;/a&gt; located in Lansing, Michigan until GM's bankruptcy, when it retook possession of the car. It was then located at the &lt;a href=\"GM%20Heritage%20Center\"&gt;GM Heritage Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sterling%20Heights%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Sterling Heights&lt;/a&gt;, Michigan. In December 2017, the car headed to New York where it was auctioned off at a dealer-only auction for $42,000 to a Florida dealer. Also sold at the auction were a 1999 Cutlass and a 1999 Ciera.\nFirsts.\nDuring the 107 years of Oldsmobile's existence, it was known for being a guinea pig for new technologies and firsts.\nExport markets.\nCanada.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; the range was limited, with the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Silhouette\"&gt;Oldsmobile Silhouette&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Bravada\"&gt;Oldsmobile Bravada&lt;/a&gt; being unavailable to Canadian consumers until much later in their production life.\nMexico.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; all Oldsmobile models were sold under the &lt;a href=\"Chevrolet\"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt; brand.\nEurope.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"europe\"&gt;europe&lt;/a&gt;an market, the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Silhouette\"&gt;Oldsmobile Silhouette&lt;/a&gt; was sold between 1994 and 1997 as the &lt;a href=\"Pontiac%20Trans%20Sport\"&gt;Pontiac Trans Sport&lt;/a&gt; by replacing the Oldsmobile badging with &lt;a href=\"Pontiac%20%28automobile%29\"&gt;Pontiac&lt;/a&gt; badging, along with Pontiac wheels. Sales in Europe were good for an American import, but did not represent enough volume to make a distinct model economically feasible for the European market. Its successors were both the &lt;a href=\"Chevrolet%20Trans%20Sport\"&gt;Chevrolet Trans Sport&lt;/a&gt; (Second generation Pontiac Trans Sport rebadged as a Chevrolet) (LWB), and the &lt;a href=\"Opel%20Sintra\"&gt;Opel / Vauxhall Sintra&lt;/a&gt; (SWB).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20Alero\"&gt;Oldsmobile Alero&lt;/a&gt; was sold in select countries in Europe (and &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;) between 1999 and 2001 as the &lt;a href=\"Chevrolet\"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt; Alero, and was only available as a 4-door &lt;a href=\"sedan%20%28car%29\"&gt;sedan&lt;/a&gt;. The car still featured its Oldsmobile badges even though sold under the Chevrolet brand, but since most European consumers would not recognize the badging, &lt;a href=\"Chevrolet\"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt; badges were added to the grille and rear fascia for the 2000 model year. The Alero featured Chevrolet emblems throughout its entire run in Israel. The Alero was replaced in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"GM%20Daewoo\"&gt;GM Daewoo&lt;/a&gt;-sourced &lt;a href=\"Daewoo%20Magnus\"&gt;Chevrolet Evanda / Epica&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarketing themes.\nEarly on in its history, Olds enjoyed a healthy public relations boost from the 1905 hit song \"&lt;a href=\"In%20My%20Merry%20Oldsmobile\"&gt;In My Merry Oldsmobile&lt;/a&gt;\". The same theme\u2014a fast, powerful Olds car helping the driver romance the opposite sex\u2014was updated in the 1950s with the iconic hit \"&lt;a href=\"Rocket%2088\"&gt;Rocket 88&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe strong public relations efforts by GM in the 1950s was epitomized in the &lt;a href=\"Motorama\"&gt;Motorama&lt;/a&gt;, a \"one company\" auto show extravaganza. Millions of Americans attended, in a spirit not unlike a \"mini-&lt;a href=\"World%27s%20Fair\"&gt;World's Fair&lt;/a&gt;\". Every GM division had a \"Dream Car\". Oldsmobile's dream/concept car was called \"The Golden Rocket\".\nThe Dr. Oldsmobile theme was one of Oldsmobile's most successful marketing campaigns in the early '70s, it involved fictional characters created to promote the wildly popular 442 muscle car. 'Dr. Oldsmobile' was a tall lean professor type who wore a white lab coat. His assistants included 'Elephant Engine Ernie' who represented the big block 455 Rocket engine. 'Shifty Sidney' was a character who could be seen swiftly shifting his hand using a Hurst shifter.\n'Wind Tunnel Waldo' had slicked back hair that appeared to be constantly wind blown. He represented Oldsmobile's wind tunnel testing, that produced some of the sleekest designs of the day. Another character included 'Hy Spy' who had his ear to the ground as he checked out the competition.\nA public relations campaign in the late 1980s proclaimed that this was \"not your father's Oldsmobile.\" The company produced a series of television ads during this time; said ads featured the offspring of various celebrities, and sometimes the celebrity in question. These ads included:\nIronically, many fans of the brand say that the declining sales were in fact caused by the \"this is not your father's Oldsmobile\" campaign, as the largest market for Oldsmobiles was the population whose parents had, in fact, owned Oldsmobiles and that by going away from the traditional vehicles that Oldsmobile's brand was built upon, lost many loyal buyers and put the brand on a collision course with &lt;a href=\"Pontiac%20%28automobile%29\"&gt;Pontiac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buick\"&gt;Buick&lt;/a&gt;, which led to internal cannibalization and a downfall from which it could never recover. Oldsmobile's final major ad campaign had the slogan \"Start Something\" in a last-ditch effort to market to younger buyers at the turn of the millennium.\nMotorsport.\nNASCAR.\nOldsmobile is especially known for its competition in &lt;a href=\"NASCAR\"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning with the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%2088\"&gt;Rocket 88&lt;/a&gt;, Oldsmobile proved heavily competitive in &lt;a href=\"stock%20car%20racing\"&gt;stock car racing&lt;/a&gt;. In the Sixties, the Rocket 88 was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Oldsmobile%20442\"&gt;442&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Cutlass would lead Oldsmobile into the Eighties before GM reduced its entries to Chevrolet and Pontiac in the Nineties. It was the restyled body of the Cutlass Supreme that (along with the &lt;a href=\"Chevrolet%20Monte%20Carlo\"&gt;Chevrolet Monte Carlo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buick%20Regal\"&gt;Buick Regal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pontiac%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Pontiac Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;) ushered in the downsized cars into NASCAR cup competition. While the Cutlass looked almost identical to the &lt;a href=\"Buick%20Regal\"&gt;Buick Regal&lt;/a&gt; (which scored 35+ victories in the 1981 thru 1985 seasons), the Cutlass (like the &lt;a href=\"Dodge%20Mirada\"&gt;Dodge Mirada&lt;/a&gt;) didn't take one checkered flag, and many teams moved away from it in 1983 to the Regal, Grand Prix, and restyled Monte Carlo SS. This was a rude awakening to Oldsmobile, which was getting used to wins on the NASCAR circuit. The body style of the 1988-92 Cutlass proved to be a winner for NASCAR competition and it visited the victory circle 13 times between 1989 and 1992, when Oldsmobile ended its racing program.\nIMSA GT.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"IMSA%20GT%20Championship\"&gt;IMSA GT Championship&lt;/a&gt;, Oldsmobile would provide power for &lt;a href=\"Group%20C\"&gt;IMSA GT Prototype&lt;/a&gt;s alongside Chevrolet and Buick. The Cutlass was used in IMSA GTO along with other vehicles also being used in Trans Am and NASCAR.\nIndyCar.\nOldsmobile was an engine supplier in the &lt;a href=\"IndyCar%20Series\"&gt;IndyCar Series&lt;/a&gt; along with Infiniti starting in 1997.\nTrans Am Series.\nThe Cutlass was used in the &lt;a href=\"Trans%20Am%20Series\"&gt;Trans Am Series&lt;/a&gt; during the 1980s. Many vehicles also being used in NASCAR at the time were used in Trans Am and IMSA GTO."
