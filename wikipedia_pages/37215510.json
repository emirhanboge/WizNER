    "text": "Act to Stop the Decline (, Fare or FFD) was a &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Italy\"&gt;political party in Italy&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 2012 as Stop the Decline (\"Fermare il Declino\", FiD). &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Giannino\"&gt;Oscar Giannino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michele%20Boldrin\"&gt;Michele Boldrin&lt;/a&gt; have been its main leaders.\nHistory.\nFFD was launched in July 2012 as a spinoff of a cultural movement, \"Fermare il Declino\" initiated by a group of seven economists with an open letter published in Italy's major newspapers: &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Giannino\"&gt;Oscar Giannino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michele%20Boldrin\"&gt;Michele Boldrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sandro%20Brusco\"&gt;Sandro Brusco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20De%20Nicola\"&gt;Alessandro De Nicola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Moro%20%28economist%29\"&gt;Andrea Moro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Stagnaro\"&gt;Carlo Stagnaro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Zingales\"&gt;Luigi Zingales&lt;/a&gt;. The manifesto of the association was signed by 240 personalities and, as of May 2013, had attracted more than 70,000 signatures.\nThe core goals of FFD included the reduction of the national debt by 20% of GDP in 5 years, the reduction of the public expenditure by at least 6% of GDP in 5 years, the reduction of the tax burden on citizens by at least 5% in 5 years, the introduction of a serious &lt;a href=\"federalism\"&gt;federalism&lt;/a&gt;, university reform, &lt;a href=\"liberalization\"&gt;liberalization&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"privatization\"&gt;privatization&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOn 8 December 2012 it was announced that the association would run an electoral list in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Italian%20general%20election\"&gt;2013 general election&lt;/a&gt;. In the election, held in February 2013, the party obtained 1.2%, returning no seats.\nFFD contested the &lt;a href=\"2014%20European%20Parliament%20election%20in%20Italy\"&gt;2014 European election&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"European%20Choice\"&gt;European Choice&lt;/a&gt; (SE) electoral list alongside &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Choice\"&gt;Civic Choice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Centre%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Democratic Centre&lt;/a&gt; and other minor parties. The list received just 0.7% of the vote and failed to elect any &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament\"&gt;MEP&lt;/a&gt;s. Boldrin publicly expressed his regret about the decision to take part in SE and criticised its coalition partners and &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Verhofstadt\"&gt;Guy Verhofstadt&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party has since been almost inactive and lost media attention and notability. In late 2015 the official website was no longer active."
