    "text": "The Wartberg culture (), sometimes: Wartberg group (\"Wartberggruppe\") or Collared bottle culture (\"Kragenflaschenkultur\") is a &lt;a href=\"prehistory\"&gt;prehistoric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archaeological%20culture\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; from 3,600 -2,800 BC of the later &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central Europe&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt;. It is named after its &lt;a href=\"type%20site\"&gt;type site&lt;/a&gt;, the Wartberg, a hill (306m &lt;a href=\"Above%20mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;asl&lt;/a&gt;) near &lt;a href=\"Niedenstein\"&gt;Niedenstein&lt;/a&gt;-Kirchberg in northern &lt;a href=\"Hesse\"&gt;Hesse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistribution.\nThe Wartberg culture is currently known to have a distribution in northern Hesse, southern &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Saxony\"&gt;Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt; and western &lt;a href=\"Thuringia\"&gt;Thuringia&lt;/a&gt;; a southern extent as far as the &lt;a href=\"Rhein-Main%20Region\"&gt;Rhein-Main Region&lt;/a&gt; is possible, but not definitely proven at this point.\nDates.\nThe term Wartberg culture describes a group of sites with similar characteristic finds from circa 3600-2800 BC. The Wartberg culture appears to be a regional development derived from &lt;a href=\"Michelsberg%20culture\"&gt;Michelsberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baalberge%20culture\"&gt;Baalberge culture&lt;/a&gt; antecedents. It is contemporary, and in contact, with Bernburg culture and &lt;a href=\"Funnelbeaker%20culture\"&gt;Funnel Beaker (TRB)&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Corded%20ware%20culture\"&gt;Corded Ware and Single Grave cultures&lt;/a&gt; succeed it.\nSites.\nSettlements.\nIts best known sites are Wartberg, near Kirchberg, Hasenberg, a hill near Lohne, as well as G\u00fcntersberg and B\u00fcrgel, hills near &lt;a href=\"Gudensberg\"&gt;Gudensberg&lt;/a&gt; (all of the above are located on basalt outcrops in the fertile &lt;a href=\"Fritzlar\"&gt;Fritzlar&lt;/a&gt; basin), and from the &lt;a href=\"Calden\"&gt;Calden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Earthworks%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;earthwork&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enclosure%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;enclosure&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly all settlements identified so far are in hilltop locations: an enclosed site at Wittelsberg near &lt;a href=\"Am%C3%B6neburg\"&gt;Am\u00f6neburg&lt;/a&gt; is an exception. Virtually all the known settlements appear to have come into existence several hundred years after the development of Wartberg pottery (see below); early Wartberg settlement activity remains mostly unknown as yet.\nFinds from the Wartberg and its sister sites included fragmented bones, mainly of &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;, but also of other wild animals, like &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt;; human bone fragments also occur in some of the settlements. Originally, the Wartberg (first excavated in the later 19th century) was interpreted as a &lt;a href=\"cult\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt; place, but the remains of coarse handmade pottery and of mud wall cladding do suggest settlement activity.\nMegalithic tombs.\nWartberg material is also found in a number of &lt;a href=\"gallery%20grave\"&gt;gallery grave&lt;/a&gt;s (a type of &lt;a href=\"megalithic%20tomb\"&gt;megalithic tomb&lt;/a&gt;). Their connection with the Wartberg settlements was only recognised in the 1960s and 1970s, thus the tombs are sometimes treated separately as the Hessian-Westphalian stone cist group (\"Hessisch-Westf\u00e4lische Steinkistengruppe\").\nThese include the tombs at &lt;a href=\"Z%C3%BCschen%20%28megalithic%20tomb%29\"&gt;Z\u00fcschen&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Fritzlar\"&gt;Fritzlar&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Lohra%20%28megalithic%20tomb%29\"&gt;Lohra&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Naumburg%2C%20Hesse\"&gt;Naumburg&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Altendorf%20%28megalithic%20tomb%29\"&gt;Altendorf&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Hadamar\"&gt;Hadamar&lt;/a&gt;-Niederzeuzheim (now rebuilt in a park at &lt;a href=\"Hachenburg\"&gt;Hachenburg&lt;/a&gt;), at &lt;a href=\"Beselich\"&gt;Beselich&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Niedertiefenbach%20%28megalithic%20tomb%29\"&gt;Niedertiefenbach&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Warburg\"&gt;Warburg&lt;/a&gt;, Rimbeck and at Grossenrode, as well as two tombs near the Calden enclosure. A tomb at Muschenheim near &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCnzenberg\"&gt;M\u00fcnzenberg&lt;/a&gt; may also belong to the same type, as may a further one at &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Vilbel\"&gt;Bad Vilbel&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20am%20Main\"&gt;Frankfurt am Main&lt;/a&gt; which was destroyed after 1945.\nThe best known of these tombs are those of Z\u00fcschen, Lohra, Niederzeuzzheim and Altendorf. They normally contained the &lt;a href=\"inhumation\"&gt;inhumed&lt;/a&gt; remains of multiple individuals (the Altendorf tomb contained at least 250 people) of all ages and both sexes. Lohra is an exception insofar as there the dead were &lt;a href=\"cremation\"&gt;cremated&lt;/a&gt;. Gravegoods are scarce but include pottery (collared bottles), stone tools and animal bones, especially the jawbones of foxes, which may have played a &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt;ic role. The Z\u00fcschen tomb is also remarkable for the presence of &lt;a href=\"rock%20art\"&gt;rock art&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of the tombs can be directly associated with nearby hilltop sites or settlements, that is, the Z\u00fcschen tomb with the Hasenberg and the Calden tombs with the earthwork. According to the German &lt;a href=\"archaeologist\"&gt;archaeologist&lt;/a&gt; Waltraud Schrickel, the association with gallery graves suggests a west European influence, perhaps from the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Basin\"&gt;Paris Basin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, where very similar tombs occur. The Wartberg tombs appear to start developing around 3400 BC, earlier than most of the known settlements.\nStanding stones.\nA loose distribution of &lt;a href=\"standing%20stone\"&gt;standing stone&lt;/a&gt;s occurs in northern Hesse and west Thuringia. Although their dates are unknown, their geographic spread appears to coincide with that of Wartberg material, perhaps suggesting a connection.\nEnclosures.\nThe Calden earthwork, a large enclosure northwest of modern &lt;a href=\"Kassel\"&gt;Kassel&lt;/a&gt;, was built around 3700 BC. It is an irregular enclosure of two ditches and a palisade, encompassing an area of 14 hectares. The enclosure has five openings, perhaps comparable to &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Causewayed%20enclosure\"&gt;Causewayed enclosure&lt;/a&gt;s. Although it can with some certainty be seen as derived from the &lt;a href=\"Michelsberg%20culture\"&gt;Michelsberg&lt;/a&gt; tradition, material associated with its early phases suggests a close connection with early Wartberg. It appears to have been a tradition for several centuries to bury animal bones (food refuse?) and broken pots in pits dug into the partially filled-in earthwork ditches. The ditches also contain the remains of many human inhumations. This activity continued until circa 2000 BC and was particularly intensive during the Wartberg period. Two nearby graves postdate the earthwork by several centuries, but coincide with that activity. While the original function of the earthwork is not necessarily explained by these finds, it appears likely that at least during later phases of its use it had a &lt;a href=\"ritual\"&gt;ritual&lt;/a&gt; significance, perhaps connected with a cult of the dead.\nIn contrast, the enclosure around the settlement at Wittelsberg appears to be simply protective/defensive in nature.\nFinds.\nPottery.\nWartberg pottery is handmade and mostly very coarse. Typical shapes in the mid-4th millennium include saucepans with inturned rim and deep incisions, cups with strap handles, collared bottles (\"Kragenflaschen\"). The presence of pottery with deeply incised patterns as well as of clay drums suggest connections with the &lt;a href=\"Funnelbeaker%20culture\"&gt;Funnel Beaker culture (TRB)&lt;/a&gt; of Central Germany.\nIn the later Wartberg, strap-handled cups, funnel beakers, varied bowls, large pots with holes below the rim and collared bottles occur. The frequent presence of collared bottles, not least in the tombs, is of special interest. The bottles are made with somewhat more care than other vessels; their very specific shape suggests a special function, often suggested to be connected with the storage of special material, like vegetable oil or sulphur, perhaps for healing purposes.\nStone and bone tools.\nSlate axes are very common, slate blades also occur. The Wartberg culture produced fine stone arrowheads with well defined tangs and \"wings\".\nA variety of bone tools, mainly points, has been found both in tombs and settlements.\nEconomy.\nLittle can be said about the economy of the Wartberg group. The location of sites and certain finds suggest a broadly &lt;a href=\"sedentism\"&gt;sedentary&lt;/a&gt; society subsisting from &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"animal%20husbandry\"&gt;animal husbandry&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"hunting\"&gt;hunting&lt;/a&gt; may play a considerable economic role. The Wartberg area appears to be in general trade contact with its neighbouring regions.\nSocial aspects.\nThe presence of earthworks and of collective tombs indicates different levels of collective effort, thus implying a considerable degree of social organisation.\nGenetics.\n examined the remains of 4 individuals buried c. 4000-3000 BC at the site in modern-day Germany, during which the area was part of the Wartberg culture and its predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Michelsberg%20culture\"&gt;Michelsberg culture&lt;/a&gt;. The 3 samples of &lt;a href=\"Y-DNA\"&gt;Y-DNA&lt;/a&gt; extracted belonged to the paternal haplogroups &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20R1b\"&gt;R1b1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20R1\"&gt;R1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20I-M438\"&gt;I2a1&lt;/a&gt;, while the 4 samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to the maternal haplogroups &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20U%20%28mtDNA%29%23Haplogroup%20U5\"&gt;U5b2a2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20J%20%28mtDNA%29\"&gt;J1c1b1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20H%20%28mtDNA%29\"&gt;H5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20U%20%28mtDNA%29%23Haplogroup%20U5\"&gt;U5b2b2&lt;/a&gt;. The individuals carried a very high amount of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Hunter-Gatherer\"&gt;Western Hunter-Gatherer&lt;/a&gt; (WHG) ancestry, estimated at about 40\u201350%, with one individual displaying as much as c. 75% also examined a male of the Wartberg culture buried at &lt;a href=\"Erwitte\"&gt;Erwitte&lt;/a&gt;-Schmerlecke in modern-day Germany c. 3500-2900 BC. He was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20I-M170\"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; and the maternal haplogroup &lt;a href=\"Haplogroup%20J%20%28mtDNA%29\"&gt;J2b1a&lt;/a&gt;.\n examined the remains of 42 people of the Wartberg culture buried at &lt;a href=\"Niedertiefenbach%20%28megalithic%20tomb%29\"&gt;Niedertiefenbach&lt;/a&gt;, Germany c. 3300-3200 BC. They showed about 60% &lt;a href=\"Early%20European%20Farmer\"&gt;Early European Farmer&lt;/a&gt; (EEF) and 40% WHG ancestry, being thus with by much more hunter-gatherer ancestry substantially different from peoples of the earlier &lt;a href=\"Linear%20Pottery%20Culture\"&gt;Linear Pottery Culture&lt;/a&gt; (LBK). This suggests that the demise of the LBK culture was accompanied by a major demographic shift.\nMuseums.\nWartberg material is on display at the following museums:"
