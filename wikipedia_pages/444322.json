    "text": "Goodness Gracious Me is a &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"English-language\"&gt;English-language&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sketch%20comedy\"&gt;sketch comedy&lt;/a&gt; show originally aired on &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%204\"&gt;BBC Radio 4&lt;/a&gt; from 1996 to 1998 and later televised on &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Two\"&gt;BBC Two&lt;/a&gt; from 1998 to 2001. The ensemble cast were four &lt;a href=\"British%20Asian\"&gt;British Asian&lt;/a&gt; actors, &lt;a href=\"Sanjeev%20Bhaskar\"&gt;Sanjeev Bhaskar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kulvinder%20Ghir\"&gt;Kulvinder Ghir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meera%20Syal\"&gt;Meera Syal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nina%20Wadia\"&gt;Nina Wadia&lt;/a&gt;. The show explored British Asian culture, and the conflict and integration between traditional &lt;a href=\"South%20Asian%20culture\"&gt;South Asian culture&lt;/a&gt; and modern British life. Some sketches reversed the roles to view the British from a &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;n perspective, and others poked fun at &lt;a href=\"South%20Asian%20stereotypes\"&gt;South Asian stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;. In the television series, most of the &lt;a href=\"White%20British\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; characters were played by &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Lamb\"&gt;Dave Lamb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fiona%20Allen\"&gt;Fiona Allen&lt;/a&gt;; in the radio series those parts were played by the cast themselves. Some of the white characters were also played by &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20Holden\"&gt;Amanda Holden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emma%20Kennedy\"&gt;Emma Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe show's title and &lt;a href=\"theme%20tune\"&gt;theme tune&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Bhangra%20%28music%29\"&gt;bhangra&lt;/a&gt; rearrangement of the &lt;a href=\"Goodness%20Gracious%20Me%20%28song%29\"&gt;comedy song of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, originally performed by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Sellers\"&gt;Peter Sellers&lt;/a&gt; (portraying an &lt;a href=\"Indian%20people\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; doctor, Ahmed el Kabir) and &lt;a href=\"Sophia%20Loren\"&gt;Sophia Loren&lt;/a&gt;, reprising their characters from the 1960 film, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Millionairess\"&gt;The Millionairess&lt;/a&gt;\". Sellers sings the song in a stereotypical \"cod-Indian\" accent, acceptable as a comic device at the time but by the 1990s considered dated and belittling. Consequently, the show's original working title was \"Peter Sellers is Dead\"; this was changed as the cast admired Sellers' other work, as well as the fact that although Sellers' Indian doctor was a parody, the actor still portrayed him as a competent professional. (In her 1996 novel \"&lt;a href=\"Anita%20and%20Me\"&gt;Anita and Me&lt;/a&gt;\", Syal had referred to British parodies of south Asian speech as \"a goodness-gracious-me accent\".)\nThe cast casually drop &lt;a href=\"Punjabi%20language\"&gt;Punjabi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt; slang phrases into their speech, in the manner of many British Asians living in the UK.\nThe show won Best Entertainment at the &lt;a href=\"Broadcasting%20Press%20Guild\"&gt;Broadcasting Press Guild&lt;/a&gt; Award and the Team Award from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Television%20Society\"&gt;Royal Television Society&lt;/a&gt;, UK in 1999.\nIn March 2014, the BBC announced that the show would return with a special episode as part of celebrations of fifty years of &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Two\"&gt;BBC Two&lt;/a&gt;. An India special was broadcast on BBC Two on 25 August 2015.\nParodies and references in the show.\nOther parodies are based on shows such as \"&lt;a href=\"Animal%20Hospital\"&gt;Animal Hospital&lt;/a&gt;\" (where members of lower castes take the place of the pets) and \"&lt;a href=\"Rough%20Guides\"&gt;Rough Guides&lt;/a&gt;\" (where tourists from India visit and make unpleasant remarks about England).\nGoing for an English.\nOne of the best known sketches featured the cast \"going out for an English\" after a few &lt;a href=\"lassi\"&gt;lassi&lt;/a&gt;s. They continually mispronounce the waiter's name, order the blandest thing on the menu (apart from one of them, who opts for the stronger option of a &lt;a href=\"steak%20and%20kidney%20pie\"&gt;steak and kidney pie&lt;/a&gt;) and ask for 24 plates of chips. The sketch &lt;a href=\"parody\"&gt;parodies&lt;/a&gt; English people \"going out for an Indian\" after drinking heavily, being rude to the waiter, demanding the spiciest thing available on the menu for show and ordering far too many &lt;a href=\"papadum\"&gt;papadum&lt;/a&gt;s. This sketch was voted the 6th Greatest Comedy Sketch on a &lt;a href=\"Channel%204\"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt; list show."
