    "text": "Perceptual dialectology is the study of how nonlinguists perceive &lt;a href=\"Variation%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;variation in language&lt;/a&gt;\u2014where they believe it exists, where they believe it comes from, how they believe it functions, and how they socially evaluate it.\nPerceptual dialectology differs from standard &lt;a href=\"dialectology\"&gt;dialectology&lt;/a&gt; in that it is concerned not with formal &lt;a href=\"linguistics\"&gt;linguistic&lt;/a&gt; differences among &lt;a href=\"dialect\"&gt;dialect&lt;/a&gt;s, but rather with how nonlinguists perceive them (which may or may not correlate with scientific linguistic findings). Because it focuses on nonlinguists' views of linguistic concepts, perceptual dialectology is considered a subset of the study of &lt;a href=\"folk%20linguistics\"&gt;folk linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, as well as part of the general field of &lt;a href=\"sociolinguistics\"&gt;sociolinguistics&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommon topics in the study of perceptual dialectology include the comparison of folk perceptions of dialect boundaries with traditional linguistic definitions, the examination of what factors influence folk perceptions of variation, and what social characteristics individuals attribute to various dialects.\nHistory.\nLinguists disagree on whether the beginnings of perceptual dialectology can be traced to the 1920s in &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in the 1930s.\nA pioneering study in traditional perceptual dialectology took place in the Netherlands in 1939 and was conducted by W.G. Rensink. The study sought to investigate perceptual dialect boundaries through a Dutch dialect survey in which subjects were asked to state whether they thought other people spoke the same or different dialect as them, and what the dialect difference was if there was deemed to be any. Weijnen analyzed this data through the little-arrow method that she devised. Many studies proceeded from this, and perceptual dialectology surveys took place in various countries.\nPerceptual dialectology studies in Japan were also taking place during the early 20th century. Japanese methodology was fundamentally different from the Netherlands' in that informants were asked to judge differences between dialects on degrees of difference (for example, from 'not different' to 'incomprehensible'). Data was thus analyzed by drawing lines between areas to indicate a scale of difference, and was the first method in 'calculating' perceptual boundaries.\nLinguists became increasingly interested in how non-linguists distinguish between language varieties, including the fact that &lt;a href=\"pitch%20accent\"&gt;pitch accent&lt;/a&gt; is one of the major ways that non-linguists distinguish between varieties.\nContemporary perceptual dialectology was spearheaded by Dennis Preston, who is seen to be the major proponent of perceptual dialectology. His five-point approach to the study has been a benchmark for the advancement of the field.\nLanguage attitude studies and its related &lt;a href=\"matched-guise%20test\"&gt;matched-guise&lt;/a&gt; methodology are also seen to be related to perceptual dialectology.\nMethodology 1.0.\nLittle arrow method.\nThe little arrow method is an early method for comparing regional dialects. In the little arrows method, researchers begin with a general map of a region, often with traditional linguistic dialect boundaries indicated for reference. Then, informants from several sites are asked how similar they believe the language of other sites is to their own. Sites which participants indicate as being extremely similar are connected by a \"little arrow.\" By gathering responses from several informants and sites, these \"little arrows\" connect to form networks of related languages. From this information, information on perceptual dialectical boundaries can be drawn. Perceptual dialect categories consist of areas linked together by the \"little arrows,\" and dialect borders are indicated when there are no connections between sites. These informant-perceived categories can then be compared to more traditional linguistic boundaries for further analysis.\nPreston's five-point method.\nThe Preston five-point method is a set of techniques developed by Preston for the study of perceptual dialectology in the 1980s. The specific measures composing the five-point method include:\nTopics in perceptual dialectology.\nLinguistic vs. folk judgments.\nOne of the areas of perceptual dialectology is discerning linguistic and folk judgments. A study by Zo\u00eb Boughton investigates perceptual dialectology in northern &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; through an dialect identification task. Subjects were asked to identify the regional origin of a speaker after listening to a voice samples. The &lt;a href=\"Pays%20de%20la%20Loire\"&gt;Pays de la Loire&lt;/a&gt; respondents (from &lt;a href=\"Nancy%2C%20France\"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rennes%2C%20France\"&gt;Rennes&lt;/a&gt;, respectively the northeastern and northwestern regions) were not especially successful at correctly identifying the regional origins of the voice samples, but were able to detect some differences between the Nancy and Rennes speakers. The results suggest two regional-perceptual axes: the \"North/east\" relating to regional or social accent divergence, while the \"West/Centre/&lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;\" is more related to standardness of accent and convergence. The usage of authentic speech samples for identification reveals how well subjects are able to actually perceive the differences between dialects according to their own folk beliefs.\nFactors in deciding boundaries.\nGeography.\nPeople generally regard their own &lt;a href=\"dialect\"&gt;dialect&lt;/a&gt; as distinct from other quite similar ones. A study of &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;ians reflected this tendency. People outside of the &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; area saw speech as having a single Bostonian accent, while Bostonians themselves perceived different dialect boundaries, with their own region being separate from the rest of the New England area. When 50 Bostonians were asked to draw perceived dialect boundaries and rate degrees of pleasantness and correctness to examine similarities and differences, they varied significantly, reflecting the difficulty of establishing distinct dialect boundaries when mapping isoglosses.\nSocial classes.\nPerceptual dialectology also concerns itself with social dialects as well as regional dialects. Social dialects are those associated with certain social classes or groups, rather than with a region. An example of this is &lt;a href=\"African%20American%20Vernacular%20English\"&gt;African American Vernacular English&lt;/a&gt;, to which is attributed lower &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ignorance\"&gt;ignorance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"laziness\"&gt;laziness&lt;/a&gt;. In one study, &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; college males were asked to imitate &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;black male&lt;/a&gt; speech and vice versa. The findings concluded that white college males immediately understood what the researcher meant when he asked the white male subjects to \"talk like a black man.\" When completing their assigned task, the white males had a ready-made &lt;a href=\"phonology\"&gt;phonology&lt;/a&gt;, a set of &lt;a href=\"paralinguistic\"&gt;paralinguistic&lt;/a&gt; features of &lt;a href=\"Pitch%20accent\"&gt;pitch&lt;/a&gt; range, &lt;a href=\"rhythm\"&gt;rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, and vocal quality, and a rich and detailed variety of roles and topics. Some of the roles the white male subjects portrayed included a &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; player, a hip, &lt;a href=\"Cool%20%28aesthetic%29\"&gt;cool&lt;/a&gt; person, and a street person. The topics included &lt;a href=\"Dance\"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"violence\"&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, the white males had an extremely limited number of &lt;a href=\"Morphology%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;morphological&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Syntax\"&gt;syntactic&lt;/a&gt; devices and a small comically exaggerated &lt;a href=\"lexicon\"&gt;lexicon&lt;/a&gt; (including ethnically &lt;a href=\"stereotype\"&gt;stereotype&lt;/a&gt;d &lt;a href=\"lexemes\"&gt;lexemes&lt;/a&gt;).\nSlang.\n&lt;a href=\"Slang\"&gt;Slang&lt;/a&gt; can also be influential for non-linguists in determining where dialect boundaries are. Many of the labels in a dialect mapping task focused on slang terms when studying perceptual dialectology of &lt;a href=\"California%20English\"&gt;English spoken in California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Barbara\"&gt;University of California, Santa Barbara&lt;/a&gt; students were asked to label a map of California according to subjects, particularly Southern Californians, used \"&lt;a href=\"hella\"&gt;hella&lt;/a&gt;\" to identify the Northern California region. \"&lt;a href=\"Dude\"&gt;Dude&lt;/a&gt;\" was also used to identify the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego\"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt; region.\nPleasantness and correctness.\nRatings of pleasantness and correctness of dialects vary between speakers of different dialects. Speakers with the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20American%20English\"&gt;Southern accent&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Memphis%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Memphis, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, rated other Southern regions as less correct than other regions, but no less pleasant. Surprisingly, they rated their own speech as least educated and pleasant. Speakers from Memphis were also much more aware of distinctions among dialects within the South, but were not aware of differences in other regions such as the &lt;a href=\"Western%20United%20States\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt;, lumping it as one largely \"correct\" area. There were also varying ratings of pleasantness and correctness among regions within the South. When English speakers from &lt;a href=\"Reno%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Reno, Nevada&lt;/a&gt; rated Southern English, they rated it as less correct and pleasant and most different from their own speech.\nHistorical perceptual dialectology.\nHistorical perceptual dialectology allows linguists to examine how and why dialects in the past gained popularity. Linguists gain the chance to examine how the perceptual dialectology of certain dialects of languages have evolved over a given time. The principal scholar examining perceptual dialectology is Dennis Preston, and his methodology involves interview-based techniques. Applying the initial methodology used in the field of perceptual dialectology would be impossible when examining the dialects of the past.\nHistorical perceptual dialectology must not be confused with &lt;a href=\"historical%20linguistics\"&gt;historical linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, which is concerned with changes in linguistic phenomena over time. Unlike historical linguistics, historical perceptual dialectology is used to contribute to the social understanding of language and is used to link dialect perceptions to &lt;a href=\"Politics\"&gt;political&lt;/a&gt; and intellectual &lt;a href=\"history\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;. Historical perceptual dialectology also has the ability to date the emergence of dialects.\nIssues with historical perceptual dialectology include relying on the text of the &lt;a href=\"Literary\"&gt;literate&lt;/a&gt; population of the past. Considering perceptual dialectology is interested in the perceptions of the common folk, relying on data from a social group of a population is not an accurate representation of the general population. Subjects should be taken from a large pool when using interview techniques such as Dennis Preston's. Another issue is having only a single case to examine.\nAlexander Maxwell, a scholar of historical perceptual dialectology, examined the emergence of the three dialects of &lt;a href=\"Slovak%20language\"&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt; and how the general population of Slovak speakers came to accept that three dialects of Slovak exist. Maxwell used articles written mostly by \"amateur linguists and &lt;a href=\"Language%20planning\"&gt;language planners&lt;/a&gt;.\" He was interested in seeing how Slovak perceptual dialectology had evolved over time to reach the consensus of the general population. Maxwell found that perceptions of dialects shifted with political shifts.\nExamining historical perceptual dialectology, evidence shows shifts in perceptions of dialects are directly correlated to historical shifts, whether political, intellectual, or &lt;a href=\"social\"&gt;social&lt;/a&gt;. These studies imply the need to study linguistics with respect to history.\nLanguage attitude studies.\nIn addition to studying how and where nonlinguistics identify dialects, perceptual dialectology also considers itself with what attributes nonlinguists assign to those dialects. \nWhen informants associate a particular language variety with a particular group, the presumed social attributes of the group are transferred to the dialect itself. That dialect is then associated with those attributes even when informants cannot correctly identify the source of the dialect. Thus, dialects can come to &lt;a href=\"indexicality\"&gt;index&lt;/a&gt; certain perceived social attributes such as formality, politeness, friendliness, intelligence, snobbishness, and other traits. Individuals who use these variants can then gain the appearance of the social traits attributed to the dialect.\nImplications.\nAs a field that studies the intersection of linguistic science with &lt;a href=\"human%20behavior\"&gt;human behavior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"culture\"&gt;cultural&lt;/a&gt; differences, the study of perceptual dialectology also reveals information of interest to many fields outside of just linguistics, including &lt;a href=\"sociology\"&gt;sociology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cultural%20anthropology\"&gt;cultural anthropology&lt;/a&gt;, and other fields that study human thoughts and &lt;a href=\"behavior\"&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerceptual dialectology also has greater implications for the general field of linguistics as a whole. While folk linguistic judgments are often examined in contrast to formal linguistic analyses, strongly held folk judgments can in turn affect people's performance of language. An understanding of perceptual dialectology is useful for understanding the ways in which people's opinions on language can influence their actual behavior, in areas such as &lt;a href=\"language%20change\"&gt;language change&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"language%20ideology\"&gt;language attitude studies&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, the findings of perceptual dialectology can prove useful in applied fields such as language teaching, where knowledge of how subjects regard different languages or varieties can be vital for increasing successful outcomes."
