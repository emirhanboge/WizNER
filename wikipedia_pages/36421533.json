    "text": "Camel's Hump State Park is a &lt;a href=\"state%20park\"&gt;state park&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vermont\"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt;. The park straddles the northern &lt;a href=\"Green%20Mountains\"&gt;Green Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in an area bounded by &lt;a href=\"Vermont%20Route%2017\"&gt;Vermont Route\u00a017&lt;/a&gt; on the south and the &lt;a href=\"Winooski%20River\"&gt;Winooski River&lt;/a&gt; on the north. As of 2017, the park covered a total of , making it the largest state park in Vermont.\nThe primary natural feature in the park is &lt;a href=\"Camel%27s%20Hump\"&gt;Camel's Hump&lt;/a&gt;, the third highest &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; in Vermont at . The summit of Camel's Hump, which is surrounded by of &lt;a href=\"alpine%20tundra\"&gt;alpine tundra&lt;/a&gt;, is the focal point of &lt;a href=\"Camel%27s%20Hump%20Natural%20Area\"&gt;Camel's Hump Natural Area&lt;/a&gt;, a protected area in the heart of Camel's Hump State Park.\nPublic access.\nCamel's Hump State Park has no phone, no visitor facilities, and no entry fee. The park is publicly accessible from numerous undeveloped parking lots and trails. The most popular access points are the Burrows Trailhead east of &lt;a href=\"Huntington%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Huntington&lt;/a&gt; and the Monroe Trailhead south of &lt;a href=\"Duxbury%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Duxbury&lt;/a&gt;. In 2016, almost 26,000 visitors signed the trail registers at these two trailheads. Parking is also available along Vermont Route\u00a017 at &lt;a href=\"Appalachian%20Gap\"&gt;Appalachian Gap&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Buels%20Gore%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Buels Gore&lt;/a&gt; and along Duxbury Road west of Duxbury, but these parking areas are much further from Camel's Hump and therefore less popular.\nAt the Monroe Trailhead, the Camel's Hump View Trail is a universally accessible trail with easy grades, a wide path, and several benches along the way. From the trail, there is a fine view of Camel's Hump to the west.\nTrails.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Long%20Trail\"&gt;Long Trail&lt;/a&gt;, a hiking trail running the length of Vermont, enters the southern edge of the park at Appalachian Gap along Vermont Route\u00a017, winding northward along the ridge of the Green Mountains before reaching a footbridge that crosses the Winooski River on the park's northern boundary. This section of the Long Trail traverses the summit of Camel's Hump and other significant features:\nThe southbound trail from the parking lot on Duxbury Road over the Bamforth Ridge to the summit of Camel's Hump climbs in , the largest vertical climb on the entire length of the Long Trail.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Catamount%20Trail\"&gt;Catamount Trail&lt;/a&gt;, a cross-country ski trail, enters the southeastern corner of the park along Vermont Route\u00a017. It crosses the Long Trail at Huntington Gap approximately north of the park\u2019s southern boundary, and then heads due north, skirting the western edge of the park\u2019s lower elevations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vermont%20Association%20of%20Snow%20Travelers\"&gt;Vermont Association of Snow Travelers&lt;/a&gt; (VAST) maintains three snowmobile trails within the park: VAST\u00a017, which is long, south of Camel\u2019s Hump; VAST\u00a017A, which is long, south of Camel\u2019s Hump; and VAST\u00a0100A, which is long, south and east of Camel\u2019s Hump. VAST 17 intersects both the Long Trail and the Catamount Trail at Huntington Gap.\nPhen Basin in the southeast corner of Camel's Hump State Park is a popular mountain biking destination. There are numerous trails in the area including the Chain Gang Trail and the East Loop Trail. Parking is available at the end of Bassett Hill Road and at the end of Stagecoach Road, both in &lt;a href=\"Fayston%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Fayston&lt;/a&gt;.\nCamping.\nCamping in Camel's Hump State Park is limited. Additional camping facilities are available at nearby &lt;a href=\"Little%20River%20State%20Park\"&gt;Little River State Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Green Mountain Club operates two shelters (3-sided) and two lodges (4-sided) on the Long Trail (from south to north): Birch Glen Camp, Cowles Cove Shelter, Montclair Glen Lodge, and Bamforth Ridge Shelter. There is a nominal fee for overnight use of a shelter or lodge as well as a 2-night limit. Reservations are not accepted.\nEach shelter and lodge has at least one wooden platform nearby for campers. The only dedicated tent camping area in the park is the Hump Brook Tenting Area with 30\u00a0tent sites. Overnight use of the latter requires a fee.\nPrimitive camping is allowed in Camel's Hump State Park below , away from trails, roads, and water, in accordance with state primitive camping guidelines and &lt;a href=\"Leave%20No%20Trace\"&gt;Leave No Trace&lt;/a&gt; principles.\nHistory.\nDuring the late 1800s and early 1900s, the forests of Camel\u2019s Hump State Park were extensively logged. Except for some remote pockets at the highest elevations, Camel\u2019s Hump was almost completely denuded by the end of the nineteenth century. To make matters worse, a great fire burned thousands of acres in 1903, sparing some of the forests along the western flank of Camel\u2019s Hump but burning almost everywhere else. Many of the trees that now cover the eastern flank of Camel\u2019s Hump had their start in the aftermath of that fire.\nAbout the same time, &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Battell\"&gt;Joseph Battell&lt;/a&gt;, a publisher, environmentalist, and philanthropist from &lt;a href=\"Middlebury%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Middlebury&lt;/a&gt;, purchased over of forest land in the Green Mountains. In particular, in 1891 he purchased Camel's Hump along with of surrounding forest. In 1911, he sold these lands (for one dollar) to the State of Vermont. The deed declared: \nIn accordance with Battell's wishes, in 1969 the Vermont legislature established &lt;a href=\"Camel%27s%20Hump%20Forest%20Reserve\"&gt;Camel's Hump Forest Reserve&lt;/a&gt; and designated the state lands in the reserve as Camel's Hump State Park. An ecological area was created \"to protect scarce and rare plants, to preserve the natural habitat, and to maintain the wilderness aspect\" of the park. The ecological area includes the land conveyed by Battell in 1911."
