    "text": "\"And When I Die\" is a song written by American singer and songwriter &lt;a href=\"Laura%20Nyro\"&gt;Laura Nyro&lt;/a&gt;. It was first recorded by the folk group &lt;a href=\"Peter%2C%20Paul%20and%20Mary\"&gt;Peter, Paul and Mary&lt;/a&gt; in 1966. Nyro released her own version on her debut album \"&lt;a href=\"More%20Than%20a%20New%20Discovery\"&gt;More Than a New Discovery&lt;/a&gt;\" in February 1967.\nThe song is best known for the next version, recorded by the &lt;a href=\"Jazz%20fusion\"&gt;jazz-rock&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"Blood%2C%20Sweat%20%26amp%3B%20Tears\"&gt;Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears&lt;/a&gt; in late 1968. This recording reached No. 2 on the US &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; and became a Gold record. In the US, it was kept from #1 by the &lt;a href=\"double%20A-side\"&gt;double A-side&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Come%20Together\"&gt;Come Together&lt;/a&gt;\"/\"&lt;a href=\"Something%20%28Beatles%20song%29\"&gt;Something&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles\"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt;. \"And When I Die\" also reached No. 1 in Canada, in December 1969.\nLyrics.\nThe song gives a positive outlook about death, stating, in the chorus, \"And when I die / and when I'm gone / there'll be one child born, in this world / to carry on / to carry on.\"\nHistory.\n\"And When I Die\" was one of the first songs recorded by Nyro, when she was 17 years old. She then sold the song to folk group &lt;a href=\"Peter%2C%20Paul%20and%20Mary\"&gt;Peter, Paul and Mary&lt;/a&gt; for $5000, who then recorded the song for their sixth studio album \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Peter%2C%20Paul%20and%20Mary%20Album\"&gt;The Peter, Paul and Mary Album&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe song appeared on the &lt;a href=\"Blood%2C%20Sweat%20%26amp%3B%20Tears%20%28Blood%2C%20Sweat%20%26amp%3B%20Tears%20album%29\"&gt;self-titled second album&lt;/a&gt; by Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears. It was the third single from the album, peaking at #2 on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;; the album's previous two singles had also stalled at #2 on the same chart.\nThe BS&amp;T arrangement is very different from previous versions. It was also released as an album version and an edited single version. The album version features two instrumental portions, one featuring an &lt;a href=\"RMI%20Electra%20Piano\"&gt;RMI Electra Piano&lt;/a&gt;, and the other featuring horns and &lt;a href=\"temple%20blocks\"&gt;temple blocks&lt;/a&gt;, like a &lt;a href=\"Western%20music%20%28North%20America%29\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; cowboy song. Also, the pauses between the choruses and the other two verses are longer than on the edited version."
