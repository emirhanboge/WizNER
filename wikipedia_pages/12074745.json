    "text": "IEEE Std 1584-2018 (\"Guide for Performing Arc-Flash Hazard Calculations\") is a standard of the &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20Electrical%20and%20Electronics%20Engineers\"&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers&lt;/a&gt; that provides a method of calculating the incident energy of &lt;a href=\"arc%20flash\"&gt;arc flash&lt;/a&gt; event.\nPurpose.\nIEEE 1584-2018 is an update to IEEE 1584-2002 and was developed to help protect people from arc-flash hazard dangers. The predicted arc current and incident energy are used in selecting appropriate overcurrent protective devices and &lt;a href=\"personal%20protective%20equipment\"&gt;personal protective equipment&lt;/a&gt; (generally abbreviated as PPE), as well as defining safe working distance. Since the magnitude of the arc current is inherently linked with the degree of arc hazard, the arc is examined as a circuit parameter. Furthermore, since estimations are often useful, simple equations for predicting ballpark arc current, arc power, and incident energy values and probable ranges are presented in this work.\nProcedure.\nArc Flash Hazard calculations are currently implemented in most of the industry plants due to &lt;a href=\"Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration\"&gt;OSHA&lt;/a&gt; regulations. The IEEE 1584 &lt;a href=\"empirically\"&gt;empirically&lt;/a&gt; derived model accurately accounts for a wide variety of setup parameters including:\nFor cases where voltage is over 15 kV or gap is outside the range of the model, the theoretically derived Lee method can be applied."
