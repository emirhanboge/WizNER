    "text": "Lowell Jackson Fellure (born October 3, 1931) is an American &lt;a href=\"Perennial%20candidate\"&gt;perennial political candidate&lt;/a&gt; and retired engineer. He was the presidential nominee of the &lt;a href=\"Prohibition%20Party\"&gt;Prohibition Party&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2012%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2012 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.\nCampaigns.\nFellure has formally campaigned for &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt; in every &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;presidential election&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=\"1988%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;. He asserts on his campaign web site that his platform based on the &lt;a href=\"King%20James%20Version\"&gt;King James Version&lt;/a&gt; of the Bible has never changed. As a candidate, he has called for the elimination of the &lt;a href=\"alcohol%20industry\"&gt;liquor industry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pornography\"&gt;pornography&lt;/a&gt;, and advocates &lt;a href=\"school%20prayer\"&gt;prayer in public schools&lt;/a&gt; and criminalization of &lt;a href=\"homosexuality\"&gt;homosexuality&lt;/a&gt;. He has blamed the ills of society on those he has characterized as \"&lt;a href=\"Atheism\"&gt;atheist&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Marxism\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"queer\"&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lie\"&gt;liars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"draft%20dodger\"&gt;draft dodger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"flag%20desecration\"&gt;flag burner&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"addiction\"&gt;dope addicts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"paraphilia\"&gt;sex perverts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"criticism%20of%20Christianity\"&gt;anti-Christians&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIn &lt;a href=\"1992%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, Fellure filed to run in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire\"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries\"&gt;Republican primaries&lt;/a&gt;. By November 1991, he had spent $40,000 of his own money on the campaign, and he sent a King James Bible to the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Election%20Commission\"&gt;Federal Election Commission&lt;/a&gt; as a copy of his platform. Regarding the 1611 English version of the Bible, he said:\nGod wrote it as the supreme document and final authority in the affairs of all men, nations and civilizations, for time and eternity ...\u00a0It shall never be necessary to change it.\nFellure received 36 votes in the New Hampshire primary and complained that President &lt;a href=\"George%20H.%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and commentator &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Buchanan\"&gt;Pat Buchanan&lt;/a&gt; were receiving all the media attention.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"1996%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1996 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; while running for the Republican Party presidential nomination, he criticized former President George H. W. Bush as a man \"responsible for inestimable damage toward the destruction of this sovereign democratic constitutional republic [who] continued to water the seeds of international, Satanic Marxism to the exclusion of our national sovereignty\". He added that President &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; \"merely shifted into overdrive the socialistic, Marxist &lt;a href=\"New%20World%20Order%20%28conspiracy%20theory%29\"&gt;New World Order&lt;/a&gt; agenda.\" He appeared on the primary ballot in &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; and received 34 votes (0.01%). In the general election, Fellure received one write-in vote in &lt;a href=\"Idaho\"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;.\nFellure again filed to run for president in &lt;a href=\"2000%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, but did not appear on any primary ballots. In &lt;a href=\"2004%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, he challenged incumbent President &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; for the Republican Party nomination. Fellure was the only candidate to appear alongside Bush in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Dakota\"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt; caucus, as he met the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Election%20Commission\"&gt;Federal Election Commission&lt;/a&gt; requirement of $5,000 in receipts. He received 14 of the 2,020 votes cast (about 0.7%), and lost all 26 delegates to Bush. After another run in &lt;a href=\"2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Fellure initially ran for the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nomination.\nProhibition Party 2012.\nAfter failing to gain attention for his 2012 presidential campaign as a Republican, Fellure decided to seek the nomination of the &lt;a href=\"Prohibition%20Party\"&gt;Prohibition Party&lt;/a&gt; at the party's national convention in &lt;a href=\"Cullman%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Cullman, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. Fellure was nominated for president on the second ballot, beating out former &lt;a href=\"Thompson%20Township%2C%20Fulton%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Thompson Township&lt;/a&gt; tax assessor and longtime Prohibition Party activist &lt;a href=\"James%20Hedges\"&gt;James Hedges&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. Party chairman Toby Davis was named as his &lt;a href=\"running%20mate\"&gt;running mate&lt;/a&gt;. The ticket appeared on the ballot only in Louisiana and received 518 votes on Election Day.\nReturn to Republican Party.\nIn November 2012, Fellure filed with the FEC to run for the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries\"&gt;Republican Party's 2016 presidential nomination&lt;/a&gt;. He was unsuccessful. In November 2016, Fellure filed to run for the party's &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; presidential nomination.\nPersonal life.\nFellure was born in &lt;a href=\"Midkiff%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Midkiff, West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, in 1931. He resides in &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Hurricane, West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, with his wife Jean, and is the father of seven children."
