    "text": "The Parish of St. Stanislaus the Bishop and Martyr in Suszec is a &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Parish%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;parish&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Suszec\"&gt;Suszec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"deanery\"&gt;deanery&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"parish\"&gt;parish&lt;/a&gt; was first mentioned in the 1326 register of the &lt;a href=\"O%C5%9Bwi%C4%99cim\"&gt;O\u015bwi\u0119cim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"deanery\"&gt;deanery&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cracow\"&gt;Cracow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diocese\"&gt;diocese&lt;/a&gt; as \"Susechz\" and again in 1327 as \"Susecz.\" In the next &lt;a href=\"Census\"&gt;censuses&lt;/a&gt; of feast days from 1346 to 1358 \"Susecz\", \"Susecz\", \"Suczecz\". Around 1350 the &lt;a href=\"Pszczyna\"&gt;Pszczyna&lt;/a&gt; deanery was created and it was subordinate to the diocese of &lt;a href=\"Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; until 1821, when by virtue of the &lt;a href=\"papal%20bull\"&gt;papal bull&lt;/a&gt; \"De salute animarum\" of 17 July it was attached to the diocese of &lt;a href=\"Wroc%C5%82aw\"&gt;Wroc\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 1598, a church inspection (the first after &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Trent\"&gt;the Council of Trent&lt;/a&gt;) of the Pszczyna deanery was conducted by the &lt;a href=\"archdeacon\"&gt;archdeacon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Krakow&lt;/a&gt;, Krzysztof Kazimirski, commissioned by &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; Jerzy Radziwi\u0142\u0142. According to the report, the church in Villa Susiecz was in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutherans&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1693 the main altar was consecrated to &lt;a href=\"Stanislaus%20of%20Szczepan%C3%B3w\"&gt;St. Stanislaus&lt;/a&gt;, but since 1703 there have been paintings of the &lt;a href=\"Apostles%20in%20the%20New%20Testament\"&gt;Apostles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"James%20the%20Great\"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philip%20the%20Apostle\"&gt;Philip&lt;/a&gt;. The right &lt;a href=\"altar\"&gt;altar&lt;/a&gt; was then dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Mother of God&lt;/a&gt;, and the left one to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Barbara\"&gt;St. Barbara&lt;/a&gt;. On the tower hung two &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bell\"&gt;bells&lt;/a&gt;: St. Stanislaus and &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Nepomuk\"&gt;St. John of Nepomuk&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a result of a fire on May 22, 1770 the entire church burned down. In its place, &lt;a href=\"The%20Reverend\"&gt;Rev&lt;/a&gt;. Provincial Osiecki built a timber barracks out of his own pocket, which served as a religious building until about 1800.\nAs a result of moving the cemetery from the church square, a new church was built. The work was completed in 1804. The &lt;a href=\"altar\"&gt;altar&lt;/a&gt; was dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Stanislaus%20of%20Szczepan%C3%B3w\"&gt;St. Stanislaus&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1884 three side altars appeared: &lt;a href=\"Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;the Blessed Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Nepomuk\"&gt;St. John of Nepomuk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20of%20Padua\"&gt;St. Anthony of Padua&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1895, the church burned down again. It was rebuilt by 1898 and consecrated in 1913.\nThrough battles during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the tower was destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1947. Over time, the church was repaired (ceiling, fence, sheet metal on the roof) and new rooms were added."
