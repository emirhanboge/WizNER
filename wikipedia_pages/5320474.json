    "text": "Jonathan Brian Gibbes (born 22 January 1977) is a &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; former player and coach. He is a former New Zealand &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player who captained , the &lt;a href=\"Chiefs%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ori%20All%20Blacks\"&gt;M\u0101ori All Blacks&lt;/a&gt;, and appeared in various &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; teams. He is the former forwards coach of &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Rugby\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland and &lt;a href=\"ASM%20Clermont%20Auvergne\"&gt;Clermont Auvergne&lt;/a&gt; in France while also serving as head coach of &lt;a href=\"Ulster%20Rugby\"&gt;Ulster&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland, and is the current director of rugby at &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Rochelais\"&gt;La Rochelle&lt;/a&gt;.\nRugby playing career.\nGibbes traditionally played at the position of Blindside Flanker, or No.6, but has also played at Lock. Due to his height of 194\u00a0cm, he was overlooked by the All Black selectors for being too short for an international class lock.\nWeighing 109\u00a0kg, Gibbes's career was plagued by injury. Nonetheless, his line-out jumping skills were impressive, and under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"John%20Mitchell%20%28rugby%20player%29\"&gt;John Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; was selected as captain of the Waikato NPC team in 2003. Despite various appearances for the All Blacks, Gibbes highest career achievement was captaining the NZ Maori to their first ever victory over the &lt;a href=\"British%20%26amp%3B%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British &amp; Irish Lions&lt;/a&gt; 19\u201313. During the match, which was played at Waikato and Chiefs home ground of &lt;a href=\"Waikato%20Stadium\"&gt;Waikato Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, Gibbes was on the ground suffering from cramp but staggered to his feet to make a try-saving tackle.\nOn 13 June 2006, it was announced that Gibbes would be joining the &lt;a href=\"Ospreys%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Ospreys&lt;/a&gt; in Wales. On 6 September 2006 however, the NZRU and Waikato announced that he has signed a new three-year contract with them. The 2007 season saw Gibbes remain in New Zealand and continue with the Chiefs, with injury again affecting his availability.\nRugby coaching career.\nIn July 2008 it was announced that Gibbes had been appointed as forwards coach of &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Rugby\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland.\nIn February 2017 it was announced that Gibbes had been appointed as head coach of &lt;a href=\"Ulster%20Rugby\"&gt;Ulster&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland, on a two-year contract from the 2017/18 season."
