It is currently used mostly for &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches and is the home ground of &lt;a href=\"CFR%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;CFR Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium holds 7,000 people.\nIt was also the home ground of &lt;a href=\"Chinezul%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;Chinezul Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CA%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;CA Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt;, which was named Stadionul Banatul at that time.\nHistory.\nInaugurated in 1913, the Banatul Stadium occupied the land of the current stadium until &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. In 1944, the stadium was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20bombing%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied bombings&lt;/a&gt;, which also destroyed the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Timi%C8%99oara%20North%20railway%20station\"&gt;Domni\u021ba Elena railway station&lt;/a&gt;. A new stadium was rebuilt by &lt;a href=\"CSF%20CFR%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;CFR&lt;/a&gt; employees five years later. It was officially inaugurated on 17 October 1949, on the occasion of a &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20game\"&gt;friendly match&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"CSF%20CFR%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;CFR Timisoara&lt;/a&gt; and MATEOSz Budapest. Until 1964, in the opening of football games, &lt;a href=\"rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; was played here.\nIn 2020, during the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, the authorities built a &lt;a href=\"field%20hospital\"&gt;modular hospital&lt;/a&gt; here, as a section of the Military Hospital, intended exclusively for the treatment of &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; patients. In 2021, the stadium hosted an eight-day &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20vaccine\"&gt;COVID-19 vaccination&lt;/a&gt; marathon."
