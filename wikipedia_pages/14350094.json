The series was produced by Nippon Gendai and &lt;a href=\"Senkosha%20Productions\"&gt;Senkosha&lt;/a&gt; (now Senko Planning), and aired on &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Broadcasting%20System\"&gt;Tokyo Broadcasting System&lt;/a&gt; from October 8, 1972, to April 8, 1973, with a total of 26 episodes.\nPlot description.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Shiranui\"&gt;Shiranui Clan&lt;/a&gt;\" have planned for 2000 years to conquer Japan in retaliation for their nomadic ancestors being banished from the country by the &lt;a href=\"Yamato%20clan\"&gt;Yamato Clan&lt;/a&gt; (who eventually became known as the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20people\"&gt;Japanese people&lt;/a&gt;). Each armored ninja-like member of the clan controls a gigantic robot warrior in order to overthrow the \"Yamato Government,\" as they call it.\nIn response to this &lt;a href=\"terrorist\"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; threat, Japan's \"National Security Organization\" send agent Gentaro Shizuka (pop star &lt;a href=\"Shoji%20Ishibashi\"&gt;Shoji Ishibashi&lt;/a&gt;), disguised as what can best described as a &lt;a href=\"Spaghetti%20Western\"&gt;Spaghetti Western&lt;/a&gt; version of a &lt;a href=\"singing%20cowboy\"&gt;singing cowboy&lt;/a&gt;, to stop their plans with the assistance of comical, &lt;a href=\"mountaineering\"&gt;mountaineering&lt;/a&gt;-clad Goro Kirishima (&lt;a href=\"Mitsuo%20Hamada\"&gt;Mitsuo Hamada&lt;/a&gt;). In an unusual direction for such \"&lt;a href=\"tokusatsu\"&gt;tokusatsu&lt;/a&gt;\" (visual effects) programs, it is not the heroic but often surprisingly ruthless Gentaro but the bumbling, bespectacled Goro who has the power to become the giant &lt;a href=\"cybernetic\"&gt;cybernetic&lt;/a&gt; superhero Iron King by touching the medals on the sides of his funny red \"Turning Hat\" and shouting \"Iron Shock!\" when danger threatens.\nHowever, often Iron King is unable to defeat the clan's giant robots without help from Gentaro, who wields a weapon called the \"Iron Belt\" that can become a slender &lt;a href=\"rapier\"&gt;rapier&lt;/a&gt;-like sword or an infinitely extendable metal whip capable of hurting giant monsters. In addition, transforming into the &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20oxide\"&gt;hydrogen oxide&lt;/a&gt;-powered Iron King quickly &lt;a href=\"dehydration\"&gt;dehydrates&lt;/a&gt; Goro, and he can only remain as Iron King for a short period of time. Strangely, although Gentaro knows Iron King's time limit comes from using up his water supply he never manages to connect it with Goro's omnipresent thirst until the final episode.\nIn the tenth episode the Shiranui Clan is destroyed but their place is taken by the skull-symboled &lt;a href=\"keffiyeh\"&gt;keffiyeh&lt;/a&gt;-clad \"Phantom Militia\" (A/K/A the \"Phantom Opposition Party\") who also use giant robots to enact their revolution against the Japanese government, although rather than being humanoid in shape theirs take the form of &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;-like \"&lt;a href=\"kaiju\"&gt;kaiju&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFrom the nineteenth episode to the end of the series Gentaro and Goro battle black cloak and Puritan hat-clad white-masked aliens called \"Titanians\" who have various inhuman powers such as flight, body-possessing mind control and the ability to enlarge themselves to giant size. Upon doing the latter they are then able to assume &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;-like monster forms.\nDVD releases.\nOn November 6, 2007, BCI Eclipse Entertainment Company LLC released the complete series of \"Iron King\" on DVD in Region 1. As of 2009, this release is now out of print as BCI Eclipse ceased operations.\nOn March 9, 2010, &lt;a href=\"Mill%20Creek%20Entertainment\"&gt;Mill Creek Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; re-released the entire series on DVD in Region 1."
