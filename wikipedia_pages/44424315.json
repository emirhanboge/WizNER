Contested over 203 laps\u00a0\u2013 extended from 200 laps due to a &lt;a href=\"green%E2%80%93white%E2%80%93checker%20finish\"&gt;green\u2013white\u2013checker finish&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 on the asphalt superspeedway, it was the first race of the &lt;a href=\"2015%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series\"&gt;2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&lt;/a&gt; season. &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Logano\"&gt;Joey Logano&lt;/a&gt; won the race, recording the second Daytona 500 win for &lt;a href=\"Team%20Penske\"&gt;Team Penske&lt;/a&gt;, and his ninth career Sprint Cup victory. &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Harvick\"&gt;Kevin Harvick&lt;/a&gt; finished second while &lt;a href=\"Dale%20Earnhardt%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Dale Earnhardt, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denny%20Hamlin\"&gt;Denny Hamlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmie%20Johnson\"&gt;Jimmie Johnson&lt;/a&gt; rounded out the top\u2013five.\n&lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Gordon\"&gt;Jeff Gordon&lt;/a&gt; won the pole for his 23rd and final career start in the Daytona 500. &lt;a href=\"Hendrick%20Motorsports\"&gt;Hendrick Motorsports&lt;/a&gt; swept the &lt;a href=\"Can-Am%20Duel\"&gt;Budweiser Duel&lt;/a&gt; races with Earnhardt, Jr. winning the first Duel race and fourth career qualifying race and Johnson winning the second Duel race and second career qualifying race. Gordon led a race-high 87 laps and ran up front for most of the race. He was caught up in the backstretch multi-car wreck on the final lap of the race and finished 33rd. Logano took the lead with 10 laps to go in the scheduled 200 lap distance and was ahead of Kevin Harvick before the last caution flag ended the race in his favor. The race had 27 lead changes among 12 different drivers, as well as 7 caution flag periods for 26 laps. There was also a single red flag period that lasted for 6 minutes and 42 seconds.\nLogano left Daytona with a five-point lead over Harvick in the points standings, while &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Motor%20Company\"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; left Daytona with a five-point lead over &lt;a href=\"Chevrolet\"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt; in the manufacturer standings.\nThe 57th Daytona 500 was carried by &lt;a href=\"Fox%20NASCAR\"&gt;Fox Sports&lt;/a&gt; on the broadcast &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt; network for the American television audience. The radio broadcast for the race was carried by the &lt;a href=\"Motor%20Racing%20Network\"&gt;Motor Racing Network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sirius%20XM%20Holdings\"&gt;Sirius XM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sirius%20XM%20NASCAR%20Radio\"&gt;NASCAR Radio&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrothers &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Busch\"&gt;Kurt Busch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Busch\"&gt;Kyle Busch&lt;/a&gt;, mainstays in the Cup Series for over a decade, both missed the race for different reasons, making this event the first race without one of the two since the &lt;a href=\"2001%20NASCAR%20Winston%20Cup%20Series%23NAPA%20500\"&gt;2001 NAPA 500&lt;/a&gt;. Kurt missed the race after being suspended during a trial for domestic violence, while Kyle suffered a broken right leg and a fractured left foot in a violent crash in the &lt;a href=\"NASCAR%20Racing%20Experience%20300\"&gt;Alert Today Florida 300&lt;/a&gt; the day prior.\nThis marks the final Daytona 500 starts for &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Hornish%20Jr.\"&gt;Sam Hornish Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stewart\"&gt;Tony Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Allgaier\"&gt;Justin Allgaier&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Sauter\"&gt;Johnny Sauter&lt;/a&gt;.\nReport.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Daytona%20International%20Speedway\"&gt;Daytona International Speedway&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"race%20track\"&gt;race track&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Daytona%20Beach%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Daytona Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Since opening in 1959, it has been the home of the &lt;a href=\"Daytona%20500\"&gt;Daytona 500&lt;/a&gt;, the most prestigious race in &lt;a href=\"NASCAR\"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosts races of &lt;a href=\"Automobile%20Racing%20Club%20of%20America\"&gt;ARCA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AMA%20Superbike%20Championship\"&gt;AMA Superbike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WeatherTech%20SportsCar%20Championship\"&gt;USCC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sports%20Car%20Club%20of%20America\"&gt;SCCA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Motocross\"&gt;Motocross&lt;/a&gt;. The track features multiple layouts including the primary high speed &lt;a href=\"tri-oval\"&gt;tri-oval&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"sports%20car\"&gt;sports car&lt;/a&gt; course, a motorcycle course, and a karting and motorcycle flat-track. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted &lt;a href=\"motorboat\"&gt;powerboat&lt;/a&gt; racing. The speedway is owned and operated by &lt;a href=\"International%20Speedway%20Corporation\"&gt;International Speedway Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe track was built to host racing that was being held by NASCAR founder &lt;a href=\"Bill%20France%2C%20Sr.\"&gt;Bill France, Sr.&lt;/a&gt; at the former &lt;a href=\"Daytona%20Beach%20and%20Road%20Course\"&gt;Daytona Beach and Road Course&lt;/a&gt; and opened with the &lt;a href=\"1959%20Daytona%20500\"&gt;first Daytona 500 in 1959&lt;/a&gt;. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.\nNew rules.\nNASCAR implemented a new camera system to officiate pit road. Forty-five cameras monitor pit road and reduce the number of necessary officials on pit road from 24 to 10. The system was beta tested during the 10 race Chase for the Sprint Cup last season and \"allegedly\" detected a high number of infractions such as driving through more than three stalls to get into or exit one's pit stall. Eight officials monitor the system from a truck outside the track and have the final say on imposing a penalty. With only 10 officials monitoring pit road now, NASCAR no longer penalizes teams for missing or loose lug nuts. The responsibility for having those lug nuts on the car falls on the teams.\nEntry list.\nThe entry list for the 57th running of the Daytona 500 was released on Thursday, February 12, 2015 at 9:22\u00a0a.m. Eastern time. Fifty drivers were entered for the race. &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Nemechek\"&gt;Joe Nemechek&lt;/a&gt; and his No. 87 team later withdrew before qualifying after the team had problems preparing the car. With the Daytona 500 being the first race of the 2015 season, 13 drivers were entered for the race driving for a different team than they had raced for in the 2014 season. &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Bayne\"&gt;Trevor Bayne&lt;/a&gt; made his debut with &lt;a href=\"Roush%20Fenway%20Racing\"&gt;Roush Fenway Racing&lt;/a&gt; after spending the last five seasons driving part-time for &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Brothers%20Racing\"&gt;Wood Brothers Racing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Bowman\"&gt;Alex Bowman&lt;/a&gt;, who drove for &lt;a href=\"BK%20Racing\"&gt;BK Racing&lt;/a&gt; in his 2014 rookie campaign, moved to &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Baldwin%20Racing\"&gt;Tommy Baldwin Racing&lt;/a&gt; to drive the No. 7 Chevrolet. &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Hornish%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Sam Hornish, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; returned to full time in the Sprint Cup Series \u2013 his first since 2010 \u2013 to drive in the No. 9 &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Petty%20Motorsports\"&gt;Richard Petty Motorsports&lt;/a&gt; Ford. He replaced &lt;a href=\"Marcos%20Ambrose\"&gt;Marcos Ambrose&lt;/a&gt; who returned to his native Australia to race in the V8 Supercar Series. &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Edwards\"&gt;Carl Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, who drove the last 11 seasons for Roush Fenway Racing, moved to &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Gibbs%20Racing\"&gt;Joe Gibbs Racing&lt;/a&gt; to drive the No. 19 Toyota. &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Blaney\"&gt;Ryan Blaney&lt;/a&gt; replaced Trevor Bayne in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing Ford on a part-time basis. &lt;a href=\"J.%20J.%20Yeley\"&gt;J. J.

Former Camping World Truck Series champion &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Hornaday%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Ron Hornaday, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; moved up to attempt to run his first full season in the Sprint Cup Series since 2001 in the No. 30 Chevrolet for &lt;a href=\"The%20Motorsports%20Group\"&gt;The Motorsports Group&lt;/a&gt;. The 2000 series champion &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Labonte\"&gt;Bobby Labonte&lt;/a&gt; took over the seat of the No. 32 &lt;a href=\"Go%20FAS%20Racing\"&gt;Go FAS Racing&lt;/a&gt; Ford for the four restrictor plate races. This was a role previously done by his brother &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Labonte\"&gt;Terry Labonte&lt;/a&gt; who made his final career start in October 2014 at &lt;a href=\"2014%20GEICO%20500\"&gt;Talladega&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Whitt\"&gt;Cole Whitt&lt;/a&gt;, who drove the No. 26 BK Racing Toyota in his 2014 rookie campaign, moved to the No. 35 &lt;a href=\"Front%20Row%20Motorsports\"&gt;Front Row Motorsports&lt;/a&gt; Ford. &lt;a href=\"Reed%20Sorenson\"&gt;Reed Sorenson&lt;/a&gt; drove the No. 44 &lt;a href=\"Team%20Xtreme%20Racing\"&gt;Team XTREME Racing&lt;/a&gt; Chevrolet. &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Annett\"&gt;Michael Annett&lt;/a&gt; left Tommy Baldwin Racing after his 2014 rookie campaign and moved to &lt;a href=\"HScott%20Motorsports\"&gt;HScott Motorsports&lt;/a&gt; to drive the No. 46 Chevrolet. &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Scott\"&gt;Brian Scott&lt;/a&gt; was entered in a one race deal to drive the No. 62 &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Motorsports\"&gt;Premium Motorsports&lt;/a&gt; Chevrolet.\nPractice.\nFirst practice (February 14).\n&lt;a href=\"Ricky%20Stenhouse%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Ricky Stenhouse, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 44.413 and a speed of .\nSecond practice (February 14).\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20McDowell%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Michael McDowell&lt;/a&gt; was the fastest in the second practice session with a time of 45.153 and a speed of . &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Newman%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Ryan Newman&lt;/a&gt; was forced to change engines after blowing one half an hour into the session. He had to start from the rear in one of the Duel races. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Truex%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Martin Truex, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; also dealt with engine gremlins due to a crack in his car's oil pan, but did not change engines.\nQualifying.\nThe pole qualifying took place at 1:35\u00a0p.m. Eastern time on Sunday, February 15, a week prior to the Daytona 500 race itself. After the 2014 Daytona 500, NASCAR eliminated the traditional single car qualifying format for the pole qualifying and introduced a knockout qualifying format commonly used in many series &lt;a href=\"2014%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series%23Changes\"&gt;at Phoenix the following week&lt;/a&gt;. The restrictor plate track rules, first implemented at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20GEICO%20500\"&gt;fall Talladega race&lt;/a&gt;, were used.\nThe top two times in the final qualifying session were locked in the front row of the Daytona 500 starting grid, while the other 41 starting spots were determined by the two &lt;a href=\"2015%20Budweiser%20Duels\"&gt;Budweiser Duel&lt;/a&gt; races the following Thursday. If a driver failed to make the Top 15 in the Duels, the time that was used to calculate the four drivers that would qualify based on time \u2013 and to grid the seven drivers that took provisional starting positions was based solely on the fastest time they set \u2013 regardless of qualifying session.\nIn what would be his final Daytona 500 start, &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Gordon\"&gt;Jeff Gordon&lt;/a&gt; won the pole with a time of 44.711 and a speed of . Gordon felt that in the new qualifying format, \"the driver finally gets to play a role\". He also stated that he had \"a fast race car\" and that the pole position was \"one of the most gratifying poles I've had, not just because it's my final Daytona\". His teammate &lt;a href=\"Jimmie%20Johnson\"&gt;Jimmie Johnson&lt;/a&gt; started right alongside in second. In the first round of qualifying, &lt;a href=\"Clint%20Bowyer\"&gt;Clint Bowyer&lt;/a&gt; tried to go under &lt;a href=\"Reed%20Sorenson\"&gt;Reed Sorenson&lt;/a&gt; when he got hit in the rear by &lt;a href=\"Jeb%20Burton\"&gt;Jeb Burton&lt;/a&gt; and turned right into Sorenson. Both cars hit the wall and collected &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Labonte\"&gt;Bobby Labonte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J.%20J.%20Yeley\"&gt;J. J. Yeley&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Denny%20Hamlin\"&gt;Denny Hamlin&lt;/a&gt; also took some damage. The session was red flagged with a minute and 22 seconds left. After the red flag was lifted, no one was able to make it back to the line before time expired. Upon exiting his car, Bowyer vented his frustrations at the Daytona qualifying procedure.\nThe cars of &lt;a href=\"Dale%20Earnhardt%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Dale Earnhardt, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Denny%20Hamlin\"&gt;Denny Hamlin&lt;/a&gt; failed post-qualifying inspection and started from the rear of the field in their respective Duel races. Earnhardt's car was found to be too low on the left front\u00a0\u2013 a rule implemented only for restrictor plate tracks\u00a0\u2013 while the &lt;a href=\"panhard%20rod\"&gt;panhard rod&lt;/a&gt; on Hamlin's car was found to be beyond the maximum allowed. Both drivers expressed thoughts on Twitter post-penalties, with both looking forward to moving up the order in the Duels. Both drivers had no time listed, meaning if either driver did not make the top 15 in the Duels, they would have to start 42nd or 43rd as they would be forced take a provisional and be placed behind all drivers with a legal time.\nPractice (post-qualifying).\nThird practice (February 18).\n&lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Busch\"&gt;Kyle Busch&lt;/a&gt; was the fastest in the third practice session with a time of 44.826 and a speed of . During this session, there was a four car wreck on the backstretch that involved &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Annett\"&gt;Michael Annett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jeb%20Burton\"&gt;Jeb Burton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denny%20Hamlin\"&gt;Denny Hamlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Danica%20Patrick\"&gt;Danica Patrick&lt;/a&gt;. It started when Hamlin pulled out of line and Patrick tried to follow him, but made contact with the right-front corner of Hamlin's car when she over-corrected and hit the wall. Michael Annett tried to go high around Patrick on the outside when he got turned by Jeb Burton. Patrick, Annett and Burton all switched to backup cars. After the incident, Patrick stated that her car \"sort of just started turning toward the right, the back end was coming around and it swapped ends\" and that Hamlin was trying to \"make a third lane in the middle and it felt like it must have caught my bumper\". Hamlin felt that Patrick had intended to block his path, stating that a driver has \"to give a little bit of extra room in practice\" and that if he \"had to guess, she probably saw in her mirror that I was going down there and tried to stay in front of me\".\nFourth practice (February 18).\n&lt;a href=\"Alex%20Bowman\"&gt;Alex Bowman&lt;/a&gt; was the fastest in the fourth practice session with a time of 44.889 and a speed of .\nFifth practice (February 19).\n&lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Larson\"&gt;Kyle Larson&lt;/a&gt; was the fastest in the fifth practice session with a time of 46.705 and a speed of . This session had only five drivers take part in it doing single car runs.\nBudweiser Duel.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Can-Am%20Duel\"&gt;Budweiser Duel&lt;/a&gt;s were held on Thursday, February 19. They consisted of two races, in length, which served as the qualifying races for the Daytona 500. The first race involved the drivers that qualified in the odd numbered positions in pole qualifying. The second race involved the drivers that qualified in the even numbered positions and the five drivers that failed to make the race. The results of the two Budweiser Duels determined the starting lineup, behind the front row pre-determined by pole qualifying, for the weekend's Daytona 500 race.\nRace one.\nFirst half.\nStart.\nThe first race started at 7:19\u00a0p.m. Eastern time when &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Gordon\"&gt;Jeff Gordon&lt;/a&gt; led the field to the green. &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Kenseth\"&gt;Matt Kenseth&lt;/a&gt; took the lead with the bottom lane to lead the first lap. The first caution of the race flew on lap 17 after &lt;a href=\"Casey%20Mears\"&gt;Casey Mears&lt;/a&gt; blew an engine in turn 1. Kenseth and Gordon swapped the lead on pit road, and Gordon exited as the leader for the restart on lap 24. &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Annett\"&gt;Michael Annett&lt;/a&gt; was forced to restart the race from the tail-end of the longest line, as his pit crew went over the wall too soon.\nTrouble in the tri-oval.\nKenseth used the bottom line and jumped in front of Gordon to take back the lead on lap 26, just ahead of the race's second caution when &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Sauter\"&gt;Johnny Sauter&lt;/a&gt; crashed in the tri-oval, following contact with &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Allmendinger\"&gt;A. J. Allmendinger&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Aric%20Almirola\"&gt;Aric Almirola&lt;/a&gt; also picked up some damage to his car.\nSauter stated that he was \"just riding along\" and that he was \"trying to mind my business\" before the contact with Allmendinger, with the point of impact being \"in the left rear quarter panel\". He also stated that it was \"a bummer deal\" for himself and his &lt;a href=\"BK%20Racing\"&gt;BK Racing&lt;/a&gt; team. Sauter did, however, make the starting lineup for the race, on his qualifying speeds, while Allmendinger took a provisional. Allmendinger apologised for the contact with Sauter, while stating that his &lt;a href=\"JTG%20Daugherty%20Racing\"&gt;JTG Daugherty Racing&lt;/a&gt; car was fast, while also criticizing the racing that was occurring, stating that he \"was trying to stay out of trouble and got put in the middle and I was trying to bail out of the middle\". &lt;a href=\"Michael%20McDowell%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Michael McDowell&lt;/a&gt; dropped to the end of the longest line, for the restart on lap 33, after his crew was over the wall too soon.\nSecond half.\n&lt;a href=\"Dale%20Earnhardt%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Dale Earnhardt, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; used a slight push from the bottom line to take the lead on lap 35. Kenseth drove past Earnhardt on the bottom to take back the lead on lap 39. On lap 43, Earnhardt used a slingshot move to overtake Kenseth for good. The third caution of the race flew on lap 51 when &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Bayne\"&gt;Trevor Bayne&lt;/a&gt; got loose, came down on &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Larson\"&gt;Kyle Larson&lt;/a&gt; and hit the wall in turn 1. During this period, &lt;a href=\"Ty%20Dillon\"&gt;Ty Dillon&lt;/a&gt; broke his gear shifter. The race restarted with five laps to go and Earnhardt. held off Jeff Gordon to win race one.\nPost-race.\nEarnhardt praised the work of his spotter T. J. Majors in victory lane, stating that he \"gave me the information I needed to make the moves I needed\" and that he was \"looking forward to getting to Sunday and trying to get another Daytona 500 win\". Dillon, finished 16th after the gearshift issues, and was able to make the field. He described the result as \"hard to explain\" and that he had \"been coming here since I was a kid watching my grandfather's cars race\". &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Hornaday%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Ron Hornaday, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Marks\"&gt;Justin Marks&lt;/a&gt; failed to make the race.\nRace two.\nFirst half.\nStart.\nBefore the start, &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Wise\"&gt;Josh Wise&lt;/a&gt; stalled at the entrance of pit road and took his car to the garage. This ultimately eliminated him from racing in the Daytona 500. The second race started 18 minutes late at 9:19\u00a0p.m. with &lt;a href=\"Jimmie%20Johnson\"&gt;Jimmie Johnson&lt;/a&gt; leading the field to the green flag. &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Busch\"&gt;Kyle Busch&lt;/a&gt; took the lead on the first lap. The first caution of the race flew on lap 19 for a spin by &lt;a href=\"David%20Ragan\"&gt;David Ragan&lt;/a&gt;, exiting turn 4. Ragan had cut across the nose of &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Allgaier\"&gt;Justin Allgaier&lt;/a&gt; and got turned down onto the apron, making contact with the inside wall. Kyle Busch was first off pit road, but he was caught speeding on pit road and was forced to drop to the end of the line, allowing Johnson to retake the lead for the restart, on lap 25. Allgaier was also sent to the rear, as his pit crew came across the wall too soon.\nSecond half.\nThe second caution of the race flew on lap 37 for a multi-car wreck in the tri-oval. It started exiting turn 4 when &lt;a href=\"Jeb%20Burton\"&gt;Jeb Burton&lt;/a&gt; turned down into &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Hornish%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Sam Hornish, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; who turned into &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Bowman\"&gt;Alex Bowman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Dillon\"&gt;Austin Dillon&lt;/a&gt; destroyed his splitter driving through the grass trying to avoid the wreck, which caused the race to be red flagged for five minutes. The race restarted with 20 laps to go. With 14 laps to go, &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Busch\"&gt;Kurt Busch&lt;/a&gt; was given a drive-through penalty for passing below the double yellow line. The third caution of the race flew with three laps to go for a four car wreck in turn 3. &lt;a href=\"Denny%20Hamlin\"&gt;Denny Hamlin&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href=\"Danica%20Patrick\"&gt;Danica Patrick&lt;/a&gt; a push which turned her around and collected &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Scott\"&gt;Brian Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Labonte\"&gt;Bobby Labonte&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a &lt;a href=\"green%E2%80%93white%E2%80%93checker%20finish\"&gt;green\u2013white\u2013checker finish&lt;/a&gt;, Johnson held off a last lap charge by Kyle Busch and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Edwards\"&gt;Carl Edwards&lt;/a&gt; to win the race. Johnson defined the Speedweeks at Daytona as \"awesome\" for his &lt;a href=\"Hendrick%20Motorsports\"&gt;Hendrick Motorsports&lt;/a&gt; team, sweeping the Duels and the front row for the Daytona 500. Johnson also called his car as \"mad fast\".\nPost-race.\nPatrick confronted Hamlin on pit road after the race. After the confrontation, Patrick told reporters that she had \"no explanation for that\", while also stating Hamlin was in the wrong by believing \"that he's taking the air and getting it off the spoiler, and he's not squared up either\". &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Annett\"&gt;Michael Annett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Blaney\"&gt;Ryan Blaney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Landon%20Cassill\"&gt;Landon Cassill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ty%20Dillon\"&gt;Ty Dillon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20McDowell%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Michael McDowell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reed%20Sorenson\"&gt;Reed Sorenson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Wallace%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Mike Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Whitt\"&gt;Cole Whitt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J.%20J.%20Yeley\"&gt;J.

Yeley&lt;/a&gt; raced their way into the Daytona 500. &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Labonte\"&gt;Bobby Labonte&lt;/a&gt; also made the race, via the provisional for past series champions. &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Bowman\"&gt;Alex Bowman&lt;/a&gt;, Burton, &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Hornaday%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Ron Hornaday, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Marks\"&gt;Justin Marks&lt;/a&gt;, Scott and Wise all failed to make the race.\nSuspension of Kurt Busch.\n&lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Busch\"&gt;Kurt Busch&lt;/a&gt; was suspended by &lt;a href=\"NASCAR\"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; on February 20, 2015 due to his then ongoing legal battle with possible domestic violence charges. NASCAR released an official statement, which was later confirmed at a press briefing with executive vice president Steve O'Donnell. &lt;a href=\"Regan%20Smith\"&gt;Regan Smith&lt;/a&gt; replaced Busch for the Daytona 500 and, per NASCAR's rules regarding post-qualifying driver changes, was required to start at the rear of the field.\nOn Saturday, the day after the suspension was announced, Kurt Busch appealed the suspension to the National Motorsports Appeals Panel. The panelists selected were IndyCar driver &lt;a href=\"Lyn%20St.%20James\"&gt;Lyn St. James&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin Whitaker, and Paul Brooks. The panel denied Busch's appeal after a 3-hour hearing. So did National Motorsports Final Appeals Officer, Bryan Moss.\nPractice (post-Duels).\nSixth practice (February 20).\n&lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Gordon\"&gt;Jeff Gordon&lt;/a&gt; was the fastest in the sixth practice session with a time of 46.613 and a speed of .\nSeventh practice (February 20).\n&lt;a href=\"Dale%20Earnhardt%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Dale Earnhardt, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; was the fastest in the seventh practice session with a time of 46.295 and a speed of .\nFinal practice (February 21).\n&lt;a href=\"Denny%20Hamlin\"&gt;Denny Hamlin&lt;/a&gt; was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 44.531 and a speed of .\nPrior to the race.\nWith nine laps to go in the &lt;a href=\"Alert%20Today%20Florida%20300\"&gt;Alert Today Florida 300&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xfinity%20Series\"&gt;Xfinity Series&lt;/a&gt; race on the day before the Daytona 500, &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Busch\"&gt;Kyle Busch&lt;/a&gt; crashed into the inside retaining wall between the tri-oval and turn 1. He was taken to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Halifax%20Health\"&gt;Halifax Health&lt;/a&gt; Medical Center after sustaining a compound fracture to his right leg, ruling him out of the Daytona 500. The wall he hit lacked a &lt;a href=\"SAFER%20barrier\"&gt;SAFER barrier&lt;/a&gt;, drawing much criticism from different drivers. &lt;a href=\"Ty%20Dillon\"&gt;Ty Dillon&lt;/a&gt;, who finished third, was unaware of Busch's injury at the end of the race, while also adding that it was coming \"to the point now in NASCAR we should have SAFER barriers at a place like this\". Runner-up &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Buescher\"&gt;Chris Buescher&lt;/a&gt; echoed Dillon's comments, stating that the sport \"needs to be as safe as possible\" and that if \"it means lining the inside walls as well, it's probably a good idea\".\nWith the sidelining of Kyle Busch, the Daytona 500 was the first race since the 2001 NAPA 500 at Atlanta\u00a0\u2013 where &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Busch\"&gt;Kurt Busch&lt;/a&gt; failed to qualify\u00a0\u2013 not to feature a Busch brother in the starting lineup. &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Crafton\"&gt;Matt Crafton&lt;/a&gt; replaced Kyle Busch for the Daytona 500, while &lt;a href=\"David%20Ragan\"&gt;David Ragan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Jones\"&gt;Erik Jones&lt;/a&gt; replaced him thereafter.\nRace.\nPre-race festivities.\nRonnie Barton of the First Baptist Church of South Daytona began the pre-race festivities with the &lt;a href=\"invocation\"&gt;invocation&lt;/a&gt;. Singer/songwriter &lt;a href=\"Phillip%20Phillips\"&gt;Phillip Phillips&lt;/a&gt; performed the &lt;a href=\"The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner\"&gt;United States National Anthem&lt;/a&gt;. The flyover was performed by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Thunderbirds\"&gt;United States Air Force Thunderbirds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vince%20Vaughn\"&gt;Vince Vaughn&lt;/a&gt; gave the command for the drivers to start their engines, while Paralympics bronze medalist &lt;a href=\"Amy%20Purdy\"&gt;Amy Purdy&lt;/a&gt; was the honorary pace car driver for the pre-race pace laps.\nFirst half.\nStart.\nWith members of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20women%27s%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;United States women's national soccer team&lt;/a&gt; waving the green flag, pole sitter &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Gordon\"&gt;Jeff Gordon&lt;/a&gt; led the field to the start of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season under clear skies at 1:31\u00a0p.m. Eastern time. He led the first lap in his final Daytona 500, but was quickly passed by his teammate &lt;a href=\"Jimmie%20Johnson\"&gt;Jimmie Johnson&lt;/a&gt; on the second lap. Johnson then maintained control of the lead until lap 14 when he was shuffled up to the outside lane and Gordon took back the lead. The first caution flag of the race flew on lap 19 when &lt;a href=\"Landon%20Cassill\"&gt;Landon Cassill&lt;/a&gt; blew an engine exiting turn 2. &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Annett\"&gt;Michael Annett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J.%20J.%20Yeley\"&gt;J. J. Yeley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Casey%20Mears\"&gt;Casey Mears&lt;/a&gt; all stayed out to lead a lap when Gordon and the others pitted. &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Whitt\"&gt;Cole Whitt&lt;/a&gt; was forced to restart the race from the rear of the field, as he was serviced by too many members at his pit stop.\nThe race restarted on lap 25 with Gordon in the lead. The second caution of the race flew on lap 41 when &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stewart\"&gt;Tony Stewart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Kenseth\"&gt;Matt Kenseth&lt;/a&gt; got into the wall exiting turn 4; Stewart's car was loose exiting the turn and got turned by &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Blaney\"&gt;Ryan Blaney&lt;/a&gt; into the wall. Kenseth, braking to avoid contact with Blaney, got turned into the wall by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Waltrip\"&gt;Michael Waltrip&lt;/a&gt;. Kenseth pitted and lost two laps, while Stewart was forced to go to the garage. Stewart took responsibility for the incident, stating that \"when it got three-wide that particular lap, it got away from me\", and that when he had decelerated, he \"couldn't even get the front end caught up\".\nSecond quarter.\nThe race restarted on lap 46 and &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Logano\"&gt;Joey Logano&lt;/a&gt; used the high line to overtake Gordon for the lead on lap 47 with Johnson and Earnhardt Jr. close behind. On lap 53, Gordon took back the lead from Logano. Gordon, Earnhardt., &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Truex%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Martin Truex, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kasey%20Kahne\"&gt;Kasey Kahne&lt;/a&gt; broke away from the pack single file, remaining that way for the next 15 laps. Thereafter, the field became largely a single-file train running up next to the wall. Nearing the end of the fuel run, the field began to bunch up and two lines of cars formed up behind Gordon. Earnhardt, Jr., Kahne and Truex. moved side-by-side behind Gordon, allowing the pack to catch up to the leaders again. Gordon continued to maintain the lead until the next green flag pit-stop sequence that began on lap 85; he surrendered the lead on lap 87 to make his stop and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Edwards\"&gt;Carl Edwards&lt;/a&gt; assumed the lead. &lt;a href=\"Denny%20Hamlin\"&gt;Denny Hamlin&lt;/a&gt; took the lead after driving past teammate Edwards on pit road the next lap. Johnson was forced to serve a drive-through penalty for his crew being over the wall too soon. Edwards, &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Labonte\"&gt;Bobby Labonte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Larson\"&gt;Kyle Larson&lt;/a&gt;, Truex. and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Wallace%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Mike Wallace&lt;/a&gt; all served drive-through penalties for speeding. After stops were complete, Gordon reassumed the lead on lap 90.\nSecond half.\nHalfway.\nDebris in the tri-oval brought out the third caution of the race on lap 105, as a hose-piece was seen near the start-finish line. After pit stops, Gordon continued to lead over Hamlin, &lt;a href=\"Casey%20Mears\"&gt;Casey Mears&lt;/a&gt; and Kahne. &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Allmendinger\"&gt;A. J. Allmendinger&lt;/a&gt; stayed out to lead a lap before pitting. &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Allgaier\"&gt;Justin Allgaier&lt;/a&gt; dropped to the rear for an uncontrolled tire and &lt;a href=\"Aric%20Almirola\"&gt;Aric Almirola&lt;/a&gt; dropped to the rear for too many men over the wall.\nThe race restarted with 90 laps to go with Gordon leading. Hamlin took the lead from Gordon with 88 laps to go, but he was passed one lap later by Logano who drove under him on the inside line. Three laps later, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. took the lead and remained at the head of the train until Logano drove under him for the lead with 55 laps to go. Green flag stops began with 49 laps to go, and Logano surrendered the lead to pit with 47 laps to go and &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Biffle\"&gt;Greg Biffle&lt;/a&gt; assumed the lead. Larson locked up his brakes entering pit road and plowed some of the infield grass getting down to pit road speed. After the pit stop sequence, Logano reassumed the lead, as Yeley was caught speeding on pit road and was forced to serve a drive-through penalty.\nFourth quarter.\nJimmie Johnson took back the lead with 42 laps to go. &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Keselowski\"&gt;Brad Keselowski&lt;/a&gt;'s engine expired with 40 laps to go, causing &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20McMurray\"&gt;Jamie McMurray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Newman%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Ryan Newman&lt;/a&gt; to collide, and this brought out the fourth caution of the race. Keselowski told reporters that the blown engine was caused by \"something in the oil pan, broke something important\", while stating that he was \"starting to get position,\" ahead of the final 100 miles of the race. Roughly half of the field pitted for fuel under the caution, with the other half staying out for track position, but without assurance that they had enough fuel to make it to the end of the race. &lt;a href=\"Reed%20Sorenson\"&gt;Reed Sorenson&lt;/a&gt; was caught speeding on pit road and was forced to restart the race from the rear of the field.\nThe race restarted with 35 laps to go. Johnson had the lead, but was quickly passed by Edwards. Two laps later, Johnson retook the lead from Edwards on the outside. With 32 laps to go, the field was racing three-wide multiple rows back. The fifth caution of the race flew with 25 laps to go when Blaney's car blew an engine on the back straight. A number of the drivers who did not pit under the previous caution pitted under this caution.\nRestart and red flag.\nThe race restarted with 19 laps to go. Two laps later, the field was racing three-wide multiple rows from the lead to the tail. Denny Hamlin drove underneath Jimmie Johnson for the lead, but was immediately passed by Truex. Hamlin took the lead with 11 laps to go, using the middle lane. Logano took the lead on the following lap, leading the next seven laps until Allgaier and &lt;a href=\"Ty%20Dillon\"&gt;Ty Dillon&lt;/a&gt; wrecked in the tri-oval, which brought out the sixth caution and forced a &lt;a href=\"green%E2%80%93white%E2%80%93checker%20finish\"&gt;green\u2013white\u2013checker finish&lt;/a&gt;. The red flag was displayed for 6 minutes and 42 seconds, as Allgaier's car had spilled a large amount of oil on the race track.\nFinish.\nThe race restarted with two laps to go with Logano leading. On the final lap, a huge pileup occurred on the back straight involving Jeff Gordon, Kyle Larson, &lt;a href=\"Ricky%20Stenhouse%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Ricky Stenhouse, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, A. J. Allmendinger, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Bayne\"&gt;Trevor Bayne&lt;/a&gt; and Reed Sorenson. As the leaders entered turn 3, the caution was displayed. Logano coasted across the finish line to score his first Daytona 500 victory and the second for car owner &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Penske\"&gt;Roger Penske&lt;/a&gt;. At the age of 24, Logano was the second youngest winner of the Daytona 500, with only Bayne\u00a0\u2013 aged 20, in the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Daytona%20500\"&gt;2011 race&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 winning at a younger age.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince &lt;a href=\"2001%20Daytona%20500\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 with the exception of &lt;a href=\"2002%20Daytona%20500\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2004%20Daytona%20500\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2006%20Daytona%20500\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Daytona%20500\"&gt;Daytona 500&lt;/a&gt; has been carried by &lt;a href=\"Fox%20NASCAR\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.
