Jeremy has also made a number of non-pornographic media appearances, and director Scott J. Gill filmed a documentary about him and his legacy, \"\", which was released on November 30, 2001 worldwide and on home media and digital download on March 25, 2003.\nJeremy has been accused of &lt;a href=\"sexual%20assault\"&gt;sexual assault&lt;/a&gt; more than a dozen times over the years. In June 2020, Jeremy was charged with four counts of &lt;a href=\"rape\"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt; and sexual assault involving four women, and in August 2020, he was charged with another 20 counts of either rape or sexual assault over a span of 16 years from 2004 to 2020 that involved 12 women and a 15-year-old girl. Upon further investigation he was indicted on 30 sexual-assault counts involving 21 victims, and as of August 2021 is in jail awaiting trial.\nEarly life.\nRonald Jeremy Hyatt was born in &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, New York, to a middle-class Jewish family from Russia and Poland. His father, Arnold (born 1918), was a physicist and professor at &lt;a href=\"Queens%20College%2C%20CUNY\"&gt;Queens College, CUNY&lt;/a&gt;, and his mother a book editor who had served in the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Strategic%20Services\"&gt;O.S.S.&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, as she spoke fluent German and French.\nHe graduated from &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20N.%20Cardozo%20High%20School\"&gt;Benjamin N. Cardozo High School&lt;/a&gt;.\nPornographic film career.\nJeremy left the teaching profession (he called it his \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aace%20in%20the%20hole\"&gt;ace in the hole&lt;/a&gt;\") to pursue a legitimate acting career on &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20theatre\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt;. He has said that he learned then what it was like to be broke, making no money as an actor who \"starved &lt;a href=\"Off-Broadway\"&gt;Off-Broadway&lt;/a&gt;\". Jeremy soon found work posing for \"&lt;a href=\"Playgirl\"&gt;Playgirl&lt;/a&gt;\" after his then-girlfriend submitted his photo to the magazine. Jeremy utilized this opportunity as a springboard into the adult film industry, which he viewed as a reliable means of supporting himself.\nJeremy had the nickname \"The Hedgehog\" bestowed upon him by fellow porn actor &lt;a href=\"William%20Margold\"&gt;William Margold&lt;/a&gt; in 1979 after a situation on the set of the porn film \"Olympic Fever\". Jeremy flew in from New York to shoot the movie. Expecting warm California weather, he wore only a T-shirt and shorts and brought no additional clothing. During the long motorcycle ride to the set, located near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Arrowhead%2C%20California\"&gt;Lake Arrowhead&lt;/a&gt;, in the California mountains, the weather deteriorated to blizzard conditions, which chilled him to the point of near &lt;a href=\"hypothermia\"&gt;hypothermia&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving at the set, Jeremy was immediately whisked away to thaw out in a hot shower. When he finished, his skin had taken on a pinkish hue from the temperature extremes, and all the many hairs on his body were standing on end. Margold's comment upon seeing Jeremy at that moment was \"You are a hedgehog, my friend. A walking, talking hedgehog.\" Contrary to popular belief, the nickname had nothing to do with his weight, as he was quite physically fit at the time.\nJeremy is listed in the \"&lt;a href=\"Guinness%20World%20Records\"&gt;Guinness Book of World Records&lt;/a&gt;\" for \"Most Appearances in Adult Films\"; his entry on the &lt;a href=\"Internet%20Adult%20Film%20Database\"&gt;Internet Adult Film Database&lt;/a&gt; lists more than 2,000 films in which he has performed, and an additional 285 films which he &lt;a href=\"Director%20%28film%29\"&gt;directed&lt;/a&gt;.
