For the first time Ro\u0161kovs played football at the age of 14 when his family moved from the countryside to &lt;a href=\"Vilnius\"&gt;Vilnius&lt;/a&gt;. He was very assiduous in training and skipped school very often because of football, however he didn't get much chance to play, not even in goal. Once when Astratijs had run away from church to see &lt;a href=\"Spartak%20Vilnius\"&gt;Spartak Vilnius&lt;/a&gt; play, his father hit him with a stick. Later Astratijs was allowed to play football only if his marks at school were good.\nIn 1959 he played three matches for &lt;a href=\"Baltika%20Kaliningrad\"&gt;Baltika Kaliningrad&lt;/a&gt; in the second Soviet league. When his father got transferred to work in construction in &lt;a href=\"Riga\"&gt;Riga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;, Astratijs became a footballer with the local &lt;a href=\"Daugava%20R%C4%ABga\"&gt;Daugava R\u012bga&lt;/a&gt;. Ro\u0161kovs was never considered an exceptionally talented player however he was very disciplined and trained hard to be kept on the team and in late 1960s he played for Daugava in nearly all matches.\nAfter retiring from playing Ro\u0161kovs studied coaching in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. He managed &lt;a href=\"Celtnieks%20R%C4%ABga\"&gt;Celtnieks R\u012bga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FK%20J%C5%ABrnieks\"&gt;FK J\u016brnieks&lt;/a&gt; and the ladies team of &lt;a href=\"FC%20Spartak%20Moscow\"&gt;Spartak Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. Ro\u0161kovs still works with young footballers.\nHe managed youth football club RTU \u2013 Rigas stars. He works with footballers who were born in 1995."
