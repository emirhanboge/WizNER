    "text": "Ancohuma or Janq'u Uma (&lt;a href=\"Aymara%20language\"&gt;Aymara&lt;/a&gt; \"janq'u\" white, \"uma\" water, \"white water\", also spelled Janq'uma, other spellings, \"Jankho Uma\", \"Jankhouma\") is the third highest &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; (after &lt;a href=\"Nevado%20Sajama\"&gt;Sajama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illimani\"&gt;Illimani&lt;/a&gt;). It is located in the northern section of the &lt;a href=\"Cordillera%20Real%20%28Bolivia%29\"&gt;Cordillera Real&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Andes\"&gt;Andes&lt;/a&gt;, east of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Titicaca\"&gt;Lake Titicaca&lt;/a&gt;. It lies just south of the slightly lower &lt;a href=\"Illampu\"&gt;Illampu&lt;/a&gt;, near the town of &lt;a href=\"Sorata\"&gt;Sorata&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite being higher than Illampu, Ancohuma is a gentler peak, with less local relief, and it is a somewhat easier climb. The peak was first climbed in 1919, by Rudolf Dienst and Adolf Schulze. Their route, still the easiest, climbs the southwest face, and is rated &lt;a href=\"Grade%20%28climbing%29%23French%20numerical%20grades\"&gt;PD&lt;/a&gt; (not very difficult). Other routes exist on the northwest ridge and the west face. Depending on the route desired, the mountain is approached either from the west or from the northeast; each approach requires two to three days from Sorata."
