    "text": "A pin mill is a &lt;a href=\"mill%20%28grinding%29\"&gt;mill&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"comminution\"&gt;comminutes&lt;/a&gt; materials by the action of &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Apin%23Noun\"&gt;pins&lt;/a&gt; that repeatedly move past each other. Much like a kitchen &lt;a href=\"blender\"&gt;blender&lt;/a&gt;, it breaks up substances through repeated impact.\nThe mill is a type of &lt;a href=\"VSI%20mill\"&gt;vertical shaft impactor mill&lt;/a&gt; and consists of two rotating discs with pins embedded on one face. The discs are arrayed parallel to each other so that the pins of one disk face those of the other. The substance to be &lt;a href=\"Homogenization%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;homogenized&lt;/a&gt; is fed into the space between the disks and either one or both disks are rotated at high speeds.\nPin mills can be used on both dry substances and liquid suspensions.\nPin mills are commonly use in the manufacture of &lt;a href=\"pharmaceuticals\"&gt;pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;, as they can achieve particle sizes as low as a few micrometers. However, heat generated by &lt;a href=\"friction\"&gt;friction&lt;/a&gt; can sometimes be a concern.\nA manual form of the mill is commonly used to grind &lt;a href=\"marijuana\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; to a useful consistency."
