In &lt;a href=\"Tupian%20languages\"&gt;Tupi&lt;/a&gt;, his name means \"ferocious snake\".\nHe was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Temimin%C3%B3%20tribe\"&gt;Temimin\u00f3 tribe&lt;/a&gt;, which inhabited the territory of the present &lt;a href=\"Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo\"&gt;Esp\u00edrito Santo&lt;/a&gt; state and came to &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; in 1564, with &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1cio%20de%20S%C3%A1\"&gt;Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet. Under his leadership, the tribe assisted the &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; in their war with &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; for total control of the &lt;a href=\"Guanabara%20Bay\"&gt;Guanabara Bay&lt;/a&gt;. After their victory, Ararib\u00f3ia remained in Rio de Janeiro until 1573, when his tribe officially received the lands across the Guanabara Bay on November 22.\nArarib\u00f3ia also received the title of &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Christ%20%28Portugal%29\"&gt;Order of Christ&lt;/a&gt;, Captain of the village (Capit\u00e3o-Mor), a salary of 12,000 &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20real\"&gt;r\u00e9is&lt;/a&gt; per year and a piece of clothing that had belonged to &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;King Sebastian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1568 he received the Christian name of Martim Afonso, to honour &lt;a href=\"Martim%20Afonso%20de%20Sousa\"&gt;Martim Afonso de Sousa&lt;/a&gt;. He died in 1589."
