    "text": "Cobb &amp; Co. is a New Zealand &lt;a href=\"family%20restaurant\"&gt;family restaurant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"restaurant%20chain\"&gt;chain&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is New Zealand's oldest surviving family restaurant chain, having opened its first branch in 1973. Its name derives from the &lt;a href=\"Cobb%20%26amp%3B%20Co.%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;Cobb &amp; Co&lt;/a&gt; stagecoach business originally founded in Australia in the 19th century by &lt;a href=\"Freeman%20Cobb\"&gt;Freeman Cobb&lt;/a&gt;, although the chain has no direct historical connection with that company.\nThe chain's trademark feature is a &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; theme with red &lt;a href=\"Western%20saloon\"&gt;saloon&lt;/a&gt;-style doors. It offers a &lt;a href=\"casual%20dining\"&gt;casual dining&lt;/a&gt; menu with steak, hamburgers, seafood, and similar items. It is known for its non-alcoholic &lt;a href=\"mocktail\"&gt;mocktail&lt;/a&gt; drinks.\nHistory.\nThe chain was created by the hotel division of New Zealand Breweries (now &lt;a href=\"Lion%20%28Australasian%20company%29\"&gt;Lion&lt;/a&gt;). Their first Cobb &amp; Co opened in 1973 in their &lt;a href=\"Auckland\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; South Pacific Hotel.\nAt its peak in the 1980s there were 37 Cobb &amp; Co restaurants around New Zealand, but the chain had shrunk to eight branches: six in regional towns and centres in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Island\"&gt;North Island&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Levin%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Levin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Plymouth\"&gt;New Plymouth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Porirua\"&gt;Porirua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rotorua\"&gt;Rotorua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taupo\"&gt;Taupo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Whakatane\"&gt;Whakatane&lt;/a&gt;), and two cities in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Island\"&gt;South Island&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Christchurch\"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunedin\"&gt;Dunedin&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn the 1980s it ran a series of comedic television commercials featuring British actor &lt;a href=\"David%20Jason\"&gt;David Jason&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2012 the chain was purchased by Sue and Ben Gower, who had originally been franchisees of the Tauranga branch. In 2016, plans to re-expand the then-dwindling chain were announced.\nControversy arose in 2017 when a newly relaunched branch located in the historic &lt;a href=\"Dunedin%20Railway%20Station\"&gt;Dunedin Railway Station&lt;/a&gt; applied for a licence to include &lt;a href=\"slot%20machines\"&gt;slot machines&lt;/a&gt; on its premises, with the &lt;a href=\"Problem%20Gambling%20Foundation%20of%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Problem Gambling Foundation&lt;/a&gt; criticising the presence of gambling machines in a family restaurant."
