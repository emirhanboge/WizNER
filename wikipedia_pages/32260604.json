    "text": "Zig &amp; Sharko (&lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;: Zig et Sharko) is a French &lt;a href=\"animation\"&gt;animated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slapstick%20comedy\"&gt;slapstick comedy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"television%20series\"&gt;television series&lt;/a&gt; created and directed by &lt;a href=\"Olivier%20Jean-Marie\"&gt;Olivier Jean-Marie&lt;/a&gt; and produced by &lt;a href=\"Xilam\"&gt;Xilam Animation&lt;/a&gt;. It chronicles the conflict between Zig, a &lt;a href=\"brown%20hyena\"&gt;brown hyena&lt;/a&gt;, and Sharko, a &lt;a href=\"great%20white%20shark\"&gt;great white shark&lt;/a&gt;, who live on a &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20island\"&gt;volcanic island&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict is fueled by Zig's constant attempts to devour the &lt;a href=\"mermaid\"&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt; Marina, (Possibly to gain her tail, as seen in certain episodes) whom Sharko loves. The series employs &lt;a href=\"silent%20comedy\"&gt;silent comedy&lt;/a&gt;: characters either do not speak, or use unintelligible vocalizations, gestures, and occasional &lt;a href=\"pictogram\"&gt;pictogram&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"speech%20balloon\"&gt;speech balloon&lt;/a&gt;s (the &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n version dubs &lt;a href=\"Hindi%20language\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt; dialogue over the animation). Three &lt;a href=\"television%20show%23Seasons/series\"&gt;seasons&lt;/a&gt; with a total of 78 half-hour episodes (234 seven-minute segments) were originally broadcast on December 21, 2010, followed by an official premiere on January 10, 2011 on &lt;a href=\"Canal%2B%20Family\"&gt;Canal+ Family&lt;/a&gt;, with the second and third seasons airing on &lt;a href=\"Gulli\"&gt;Gulli&lt;/a&gt;, and reruns airing on &lt;a href=\"TF1\"&gt;TF1&lt;/a&gt;. \nA third season was announced in December 2018.\nPremise.\nThe series focuses on the exploits and adventures of a group of characters - Zig, a &lt;a href=\"brown%20hyena\"&gt;brown hyena&lt;/a&gt;; Sharko, a &lt;a href=\"great%20white%20shark\"&gt;great white shark&lt;/a&gt;; Marina, a &lt;a href=\"mermaid\"&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"red%20hair\"&gt;red hair&lt;/a&gt;; and Bernie, a &lt;a href=\"hermit%20crab\"&gt;hermit crab&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the stories of each episode revolve around an eternal war over Marina between Zig, who attempts to capture her to eat her, and Sharko, who loves her and acts as her bodyguard against Zig's various plans. The show itself draws inspiration for its plot and slapstick humor from the cartoons of &lt;a href=\"Wile%20E.%20Coyote%20and%20the%20Road%20Runner\"&gt;Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner&lt;/a&gt;, in that Zig often makes use of various items or concocts plans based on things he witnesses with Sharko and Marina, but is often foiled by the former, bad luck, or a combination of both, that often results in him receiving grievous bodily injury. Alongside the main characters, the show is frequently populated by minor background characters, many of whom are animals and aquatic creatures that, alongside Zig and Sharko, are portrayed as anthropomorphic beings. Although Zig and Sharko are real enemies and have intense grudges against each other, they are also best friends; Sharko can't live without Zig and Zig can't live without Sharko, as shown in the episodes \"Lost in the Jungle\" and \"Freezing Buddies.\"\nCharacters.\nNone of the characters in the series speak; a form of gibberish speech is sometimes used, but most interactions involve hand signals and body language to convey what a character is thinking about. The show's main characters include:\nRecurring.\nAlongside the main characters, various episodes feature a variety of background and minor characters to the stories - jungle animals, aquatic lifeforms, and various human characters - in the first season, one of these human characters is portrayed as a Japanese cargo ship captain, who, as a running gag, frequently crashes his ship into the island and is forced to return home via a rubber dingy. Throughout the first season, several episodes featured the supporting character of &lt;a href=\"Neptune%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Neptune&lt;/a&gt;, based on the mythological &lt;a href=\"Roman%20religion\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; god of the sea and portrayed as a vain, muscular &lt;a href=\"merman\"&gt;merman&lt;/a&gt; with numerous &lt;a href=\"killer%20whale\"&gt;killer whale&lt;/a&gt; henchmen, who competed with Sharko for Marina's love, despite her disliking him whom Marina despises and often has to rely on Sharko and Zig to keep him at bay, the production team also added in the Greek god &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, portrayed as a muscular, elder merman, who served as Marina's adopted father, and an &lt;a href=\"amnesia\"&gt;amnesia&lt;/a&gt;c human &lt;a href=\"cargo%20plane\"&gt;cargo plane&lt;/a&gt; pilot who often exhibits the behavior of a monkey due to his condition.\nSetting.\nThroughout the first season, much of the plots revolve around the oceans surrounding a tropical &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20island\"&gt;volcanic island&lt;/a&gt;, alongside its coastline, in which Marina often spends the day residing on a rocky pinnacle off the coast during the day, while residing in an underwater home that she shares with Sharko. In the second season, the plots shifted to the island itself, including its beaches, volcano, and jungle, with some changes for the main characters - Marina takes residence in an ornate, life-sized sandcastle evocative of the &lt;a href=\"Taj%20Mahal\"&gt;Taj Mahal&lt;/a&gt;, built by Sharko; Zig and Bernie live with the cargo plane pilot in his crash plane within the jungle, and Sharko operates as a lifeguard for the aquatic lifeforms who frequent the beaches. In the third season, the main characters and the island's inhabitants move onto a cruise ship to travel the oceans, where much of the season's plots take place.\nProduction and development.\nIn 2008, the television group &lt;a href=\"Canal%2B\"&gt;Canal+&lt;/a&gt; decided to develop pilot episodes for nine out of 135 animation projects received, including \"Zig and Sharko\", for television broadcast during the 2010\u20132011 season. A development budget of 6 to 6.5 million &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s ( to million US dollars) was allocated to the series.

The type of animation is similar to the American series of &lt;a href=\"Tex%20Avery\"&gt;Tex Avery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Clampett\"&gt;Bob Clampett&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Tom%20and%20Jerry\"&gt;Tom and Jerry&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Oggy%20and%20the%20Cockroaches\"&gt;Oggy and the Cockroaches&lt;/a&gt;\", the latter also produced by &lt;a href=\"Marc%20du%20Pontavice\"&gt;Marc du Pontavice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dong%20Woo%20Animation\"&gt;Dong Woo Animation&lt;/a&gt; and Armada TMT contributed some of the animations for this series.\nThe development of the series was carried out by the French studios &lt;a href=\"Xilam\"&gt;Xilam&lt;/a&gt; known for other successful series such as \"&lt;a href=\"Space%20Goofs\"&gt;Space Goofs&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Oggy%20and%20the%20Cockroaches\"&gt;Oggy and the Cockroaches&lt;/a&gt;\", the series\u2019 first season has been ordered and picked up by Xilam Animation in 2009, which premiered on Canal+ on December 21, 2010, the series was launched on Canal+ Family on February 12, 2011, on Cartoon+ every Saturday at 7:40 pm.
