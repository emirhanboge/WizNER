According to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the consolidated population of Indianapolis and Marion County in 2020 was 977,642. The \"&lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20%28balance%29\"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt;\" population, which excludes semi-autonomous municipalities in Marion County, was 887,642. It is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20cities%20by%20population\"&gt;15th most populous&lt;/a&gt; city in the U.S., the third-most populous city in the &lt;a href=\"Midwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Columbus%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Columbus, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, and the fourth-most populous state capital after &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Phoenix, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Austin%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;; and Columbus. The &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Indianapolis metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Metropolitan%20Statistical%20Areas\"&gt;33rd most populous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20statistical%20area\"&gt;metropolitan statistical area&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., with 2,048,703 residents. Its &lt;a href=\"Combined%20statistical%20area\"&gt;combined statistical area ranks 28th&lt;/a&gt;, with a population of 2,431,361. Indianapolis covers , making it the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20cities%20by%20area\"&gt;18th largest city by land area&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.\n&lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Indigenous peoples&lt;/a&gt; inhabited the area dating to as early as 10,000 BC. In 1818, the &lt;a href=\"Lenape\"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt; relinquished their tribal lands in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20St.%20Mary%27s\"&gt;Treaty of St. Mary's&lt;/a&gt;. In 1821, Indianapolis was founded as a &lt;a href=\"planned%20city\"&gt;planned city&lt;/a&gt; for the new seat of Indiana's state government. The city was &lt;a href=\"plat\"&gt;plat&lt;/a&gt;ted by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Ralston\"&gt;Alexander Ralston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elias%20Pym%20Fordham\"&gt;Elias Pym Fordham&lt;/a&gt; on a grid next to the &lt;a href=\"White%20River%20%28Indiana%29\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;. Completion of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Road\"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Road\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; roads and arrival of rail later solidified the city's position as a manufacturing and transportation hub. Two of the city's nicknames reflect its historical ties to transportation\u2014the \"&lt;a href=\"Crossroads%20of%20America\"&gt;Crossroads of America&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Railroad City\". Since the 1970 &lt;a href=\"city-county%20consolidation\"&gt;city-county consolidation&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Unigov\"&gt;Unigov&lt;/a&gt;, local government administration operates under the direction of an elected 25-member &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20City-County%20Council\"&gt;city-county council&lt;/a&gt; headed by the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Indianapolis\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndianapolis anchors the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20U.S.%20metropolitan%20areas%20by%20GDP\"&gt;29th largest economic region&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., based primarily on the sectors of finance and insurance, manufacturing, professional and business services, education and health care, government, and wholesale trade. The city has notable &lt;a href=\"niche%20market\"&gt;niche market&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"amateur%20sports\"&gt;amateur sports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"auto%20racing\"&gt;auto racing&lt;/a&gt;. The city is home to three &lt;a href=\"Fortune%20500\"&gt;\"Fortune\" 500&lt;/a&gt; companies, two major league sports clubs, four university campuses, and several museums, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Children%27s%20Museum%20of%20Indianapolis\"&gt;the world's largest children's museum&lt;/a&gt;. However, the city is perhaps best known for annually hosting the world's largest single-day sporting event, the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt;. Among the city's &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20listings%20in%20Marion%20County%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;historic sites and districts&lt;/a&gt;, Indianapolis is home to the largest collection of monuments dedicated to veterans and war casualties in the U.S. outside of &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe name Indianapolis is derived from the state's name, Indiana (meaning \"Land of the Indians\", or simply \"Indian Land\"), and \"\", the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; word for \"city.\" &lt;a href=\"Jeremiah%20Sullivan\"&gt;Jeremiah Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, justice of the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;Indiana Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;, is credited with coining the name. Other names considered were Concord, Suwarrow, and &lt;a href=\"Tecumseh\"&gt;Tecumseh&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounding.\nIn 1816, the year Indiana gained statehood, the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Congress\"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; donated four sections of federal land to establish a permanent seat of state government. Two years later, under the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20St.%20Mary%27s\"&gt;Treaty of St. Mary's&lt;/a&gt; (1818), the &lt;a href=\"Lenape\"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt; relinquished title to their tribal lands in central Indiana, agreeing to leave the area by 1821. This tract of land, which was called the &lt;a href=\"New%20Purchase%20%281818%29\"&gt;New Purchase&lt;/a&gt;, included the site selected for the new state capital in 1820. The indigenous people of the land prior to &lt;a href=\"Indian%20removals%20in%20Indiana\"&gt;systematic removal&lt;/a&gt; are the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Nation%20of%20Indiana\"&gt;Miami Nation of Indiana&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Miami%20Nation%20of%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Miami Nation of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;) and Indianapolis makes up part of Cession 99; the primary treaty between the indigenous population and the United States was the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20St.%20Mary%27s%20%281818%29\"&gt;Treaty of St. Mary's (1818)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe availability of new federal lands for purchase in central Indiana attracted settlers, many of them descendants of families from northwestern Europe. Although many of these first European and American settlers were &lt;a href=\"Protestants\"&gt;Protestants&lt;/a&gt;, a large proportion of the early &lt;a href=\"Irish%20people\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; immigrants were &lt;a href=\"Catholics\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt;. Few &lt;a href=\"African%20American\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt;s lived in central Indiana before 1840. The first &lt;a href=\"European%20American\"&gt;European American&lt;/a&gt;s to permanently settle in the area that became Indianapolis were either the McCormick or Pogue families. The McCormicks are generally considered to be the first permanent settlers; however, some historians believe &lt;a href=\"George%20Pogue\"&gt;George Pogue&lt;/a&gt; and family may have arrived first, on March 2, 1819, and settled in a log cabin along the creek that was later called &lt;a href=\"Pogue%27s%20Run\"&gt;Pogue's Run&lt;/a&gt;. Other historians have argued as early as 1822 that &lt;a href=\"John%20Wesley%20McCormick\"&gt;John Wesley McCormick&lt;/a&gt;, his family, and employees became the area's first European American settlers, settling near the &lt;a href=\"White%20River%20%28Indiana%29\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt; in February 1820.\nOn January 11, 1820, the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;Indiana General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital. The state legislature approved the site, adopting the name Indianapolis on January 6, 1821. In April, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Ralston\"&gt;Alexander Ralston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elias%20Pym%20Fordham\"&gt;Elias Pym Fordham&lt;/a&gt; were appointed to survey and design a town plan for the new settlement. Indianapolis became a seat of county government on December 31, 1821, when &lt;a href=\"Marion%20County%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Marion County&lt;/a&gt;, was established. A combined county and town government continued until 1832 when Indianapolis was incorporated as a town. Indianapolis became an incorporated city effective March 30, 1847. &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Henderson%20%28Indianapolis%20mayor%29\"&gt;Samuel Henderson&lt;/a&gt;, the city's first mayor, led the new city government, which included a seven-member city council. In 1853, voters approved a new city charter that provided for an elected mayor and a fourteen-member city council. The city charter continued to be revised as Indianapolis expanded. Effective January 1, 1825, the seat of state government moved to Indianapolis from &lt;a href=\"Corydon%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Corydon, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to state government offices, a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20district%20court\"&gt;U.S. district court&lt;/a&gt; was established at Indianapolis in 1825.\nGrowth occurred with the opening of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Road\"&gt;National Road&lt;/a&gt; through the town in 1827, the first major federally funded highway in the United States. A small segment of the ultimately failed &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Central%20Canal\"&gt;Indiana Central Canal&lt;/a&gt; was opened in 1839. The first railroad to serve Indianapolis, the &lt;a href=\"Jeffersonville%2C%20Madison%20and%20Indianapolis%20Railroad\"&gt;Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad&lt;/a&gt;, began operation in 1847, and subsequent railroad connections fostered growth. &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Union%20Station\"&gt;Indianapolis Union Station&lt;/a&gt; was the first of its kind in the world when it opened in 1853.\nCivil War and Gilded Age.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, Indianapolis was mostly loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; cause. &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Indiana\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20P.%20Morton\"&gt;Oliver P. Morton&lt;/a&gt;, a major supporter of &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Lincoln\"&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, quickly made Indianapolis a rallying place for &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army\"&gt;Union army&lt;/a&gt; troops. On February 11, 1861, &lt;a href=\"President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President-elect&lt;/a&gt; Lincoln arrived in the city, en route to &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; for his &lt;a href=\"First%20inauguration%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln\"&gt;presidential inauguration&lt;/a&gt;, marking the first visit from a president-elect in the city's history. On April 16, 1861, the first orders were issued to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis as a headquarters for the state's volunteer soldiers. Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits signed up to fight for the Union.\nIndianapolis became a major logistics hub during the war, establishing the city as a crucial military base. Between 1860 and 1870, the city's population more than doubled. An estimated 4,000 men from Indianapolis served in 39 regiments, and an estimated 700 died during the war. On May 20, 1863, Union soldiers attempted to disrupt a statewide Democratic convention at Indianapolis, forcing the proceedings to be adjourned, sarcastically referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pogue%27s%20Run\"&gt;Battle of Pogue's Run&lt;/a&gt;. Fear turned to panic in July 1863, during &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Raid\"&gt;Morgan's Raid&lt;/a&gt; into southern Indiana, but Confederate forces turned east toward &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, never reaching Indianapolis. On April 30, 1865, Lincoln's funeral train made a stop at Indianapolis, where an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 people passed the assassinated president's &lt;a href=\"bier\"&gt;bier&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Statehouse\"&gt;Indiana Statehouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Civil War\u2014and in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Second Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Indianapolis experienced tremendous growth and prosperity. In 1880, Indianapolis was the world's third largest pork packing city, after &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, and the second largest railroad center in the United States by 1888. By 1890, the city's population surpassed 100,000. Some of the city's most notable businesses were founded during this period of growth and innovation, including &lt;a href=\"L.%20S.%20Ayres\"&gt;L. S. Ayres&lt;/a&gt; (1872), &lt;a href=\"Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Company\"&gt;Eli Lilly and Company&lt;/a&gt; (1876), &lt;a href=\"Madam%20C.%20J.%20Walker%20Manufacturing%20Company\"&gt;Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company&lt;/a&gt; (1910), and &lt;a href=\"Allison%20Transmission\"&gt;Allison Transmission&lt;/a&gt; (1915). Once home to 60 automakers, Indianapolis rivaled &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt; as a center of automobile manufacturing. The city was an early focus of &lt;a href=\"labor%20organization\"&gt;labor organization&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Street%20Car%20Strike%20of%201913\"&gt;Indianapolis Street Car Strike of 1913&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent police mutiny and riots led to the creation of the state's earliest labor-protection laws, including a &lt;a href=\"minimum%20wage\"&gt;minimum wage&lt;/a&gt;, regular work weeks, and improved working conditions. The &lt;a href=\"International%20Typographical%20Union\"&gt;International Typographical Union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20Mine%20Workers%20of%20America\"&gt;United Mine Workers of America&lt;/a&gt; were among several influential labor unions based in the city.\nProgressive Era to World War II.\nSome of the city's most prominent architectural features and best known historical events date from the turn of the 20th century. The &lt;a href=\"Soldiers%27%20and%20Sailors%27%20Monument%20%28Indianapolis%29\"&gt;Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated on May 15, 1902, would later become the city's unofficial symbol. &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Harroun\"&gt;Ray Harroun&lt;/a&gt; won the inaugural running of the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt;, held May 30, &lt;a href=\"1911%20Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;1911&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Indianapolis Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt;. Indianapolis was one of the hardest hit cities in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Flood%20of%201913\"&gt;Great Flood of 1913&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in five known deaths and the displacement of 7,000 families.\nPost\u2013World War II.\nAs a stop on the &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Railroad\"&gt;Underground Railroad&lt;/a&gt;, Indianapolis had one of the largest black populations in the &lt;a href=\"Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29\"&gt;Northern States&lt;/a&gt;, until the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29\"&gt;Great Migration&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"D.%20C.%20Stephenson\"&gt;D. C. Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Klan\"&gt;Indiana Klan&lt;/a&gt; became the most powerful political and social organization in Indianapolis from 1921 through 1928, controlling City Council and the Board of School Commissioners, among others. At its height, more than 40% of native-born white males in Indianapolis claimed membership in the Klan. While campaigning in the city in 1968, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; delivered one of the most lauded &lt;a href=\"Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%27s%20speech%20on%20the%20assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.\"&gt;speeches&lt;/a&gt; in 20th century American history, following the assassination of civil rights leader &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.\"&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/a&gt; As in most U.S. cities during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Rights%20Movement\"&gt;Civil Rights Movement&lt;/a&gt;, the city experienced strained race relations. A 1971 federal court decision forcing &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Public%20Schools\"&gt;Indianapolis Public Schools&lt;/a&gt; to implement &lt;a href=\"desegregation%20busing\"&gt;desegregation busing&lt;/a&gt; proved controversial.\nUnder the mayoral administration of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Lugar\"&gt;Richard Lugar&lt;/a&gt;, the city and county governments restructured, consolidating most public services into a new entity called &lt;a href=\"Unigov\"&gt;Unigov&lt;/a&gt;. The plan removed bureaucratic redundancies, captured increasingly &lt;a href=\"suburbanization\"&gt;suburbanizing&lt;/a&gt; tax revenue, and created a &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"political%20machine\"&gt;political machine&lt;/a&gt; that dominated Indianapolis politics until the 2000s. Unigov went into effect on January 1, 1970, increasing the city's land area by and population by 268,366 people. It was the first major city-county consolidation to occur in the United States without a &lt;a href=\"referendum\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; since the creation of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Greater%20New%20York\"&gt;City of Greater New York&lt;/a&gt; in 1898.\nAmid the changes in government and growth, the city invested in an aggressive strategy to brand Indianapolis as a &lt;a href=\"sports%20tourism\"&gt;sports tourism&lt;/a&gt; destination, known as the Indianapolis Project. Under the administration of the city's longest-serving mayor, &lt;a href=\"William%20Hudnut\"&gt;William Hudnut&lt;/a&gt; (1976\u20131992), millions of dollars were poured into sport facilities and public relations campaigns as part of an economic development strategy. The strategy was successful in landing the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Olympic%20Festival\"&gt;U.S. Olympic Festival&lt;/a&gt; in 1983, securing the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Colts%20relocation%20to%20Indianapolis\"&gt;1984 relocation&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Colts\"&gt;Baltimore Colts&lt;/a&gt;, and hosting the &lt;a href=\"1987%20Pan%20American%20Games\"&gt;1987 Pan American Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern Indianapolis.\nEconomic development initiatives focused on revitalizing the city's downtown continued in the 1990s under the mayoral administration of &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Goldsmith\"&gt;Stephen Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt;. During this period, a number of cultural amenities were completed at &lt;a href=\"White%20River%20State%20Park\"&gt;White River State Park&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Central%20Canal\"&gt;Canal Walk&lt;/a&gt; continued development, &lt;a href=\"Circle%20Centre%20Mall\"&gt;Circle Centre Mall&lt;/a&gt; was completed, and new sports venues (&lt;a href=\"Victory%20Field\"&gt;Victory Field&lt;/a&gt; and Conseco Fieldhouse, now &lt;a href=\"Gainbridge%20Fieldhouse\"&gt;Gainbridge Fieldhouse&lt;/a&gt;) were opened. In 1999, several &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Cultural%20Districts\"&gt;cultural districts&lt;/a&gt; were designated to capitalize on cultural assets within historically significant neighborhoods unique to the city's heritage as a means to promote continued economic development.\nDuring the 2000s, the city invested heavily in infrastructure projects, including two of the largest building projects in the city's history: the $1.1\u00a0billion &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Indianapolis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; Colonel H. Weir Cook Terminal and $720\u00a0million &lt;a href=\"Lucas%20Oil%20Stadium\"&gt;Lucas Oil Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, both opened in 2008. A $275\u00a0million expansion of the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Convention%20Center\"&gt;Indiana Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; was completed in 2011. Construction began that year on DigIndy, a $1.9\u00a0billion project to correct the city's &lt;a href=\"Combined%20sewer%23Combined%20sewer%20overflows%20%28CSOs%29\"&gt;combined sewer overflows&lt;/a&gt; by 2025. Rapid transit was reintroduced to Indianapolis with the opening of &lt;a href=\"IndyGo\"&gt;IndyGo&lt;/a&gt;'s $96\u00a0million &lt;a href=\"Red%20Line%20%28IndyGo%29\"&gt;Red Line&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bus%20rapid%20transit\"&gt;bus rapid transit&lt;/a&gt; project in 2019.\nGeography and environment.\nIndianapolis is located in the &lt;a href=\"East%20North%20Central%20States\"&gt;East North Central&lt;/a&gt; region of the &lt;a href=\"Midwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;Midwestern United States&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"central%20Indiana\"&gt;central Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20%28balance%29\"&gt;Indianapolis (balance)&lt;/a&gt; encompasses a total area of , of which is land and is water. Indianapolis is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20cities%20by%20area\"&gt;18th largest city by land area&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. The consolidated city boundaries are coterminous with &lt;a href=\"Marion%20County%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Marion County&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of the autonomous municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Beech%20Grove%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Beech Grove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southport%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Southport&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Speedway%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Speedway&lt;/a&gt;. Nine &lt;a href=\"civil%20township\"&gt;townships&lt;/a&gt; form the broadest geographic divisions within the city and county.\nTopography.\nIndianapolis is within the Tipton Till Plain, a flat to gently sloping terrain underlain by glacial deposits known as &lt;a href=\"till\"&gt;till&lt;/a&gt;. The lowest point in the city is about &lt;a href=\"above%20mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;above mean sea level&lt;/a&gt;, with the highest natural elevation at about above sea level. Few hills or short &lt;a href=\"ridge\"&gt;ridge&lt;/a&gt;s, known as &lt;a href=\"kame\"&gt;kame&lt;/a&gt;s, rise about to above the surrounding terrain. The city lies just north of the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Uplands\"&gt;Indiana Uplands&lt;/a&gt;, a region characterized by rolling hills and high &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; content.\nTopographic relief slopes gently toward the &lt;a href=\"White%20River%20%28Indiana%29\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt; and its two primary tributaries, &lt;a href=\"Fall%20Creek%20%28Indiana%29\"&gt;Fall&lt;/a&gt; and Eagle creeks. In total, there are about 35 streams in the city, including &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Creek%20%28Fall%20Creek%29\"&gt;Indian Creek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pogue%27s%20Run\"&gt;Pogue's Run&lt;/a&gt;.

Indianapolis's current urban tree canopy averages approximately 33%. A rare example of &lt;a href=\"old-growth%20forest\"&gt;old-growth forest&lt;/a&gt; in the city can be found on of &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Crown Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;'s North Woods in the &lt;a href=\"Butler%E2%80%93Tarkington%2C%20Indianapolis\"&gt;Butler\u2013Tarkington&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood.

It experiences four distinct seasons. The city is in &lt;a href=\"Hardiness%20zone%23United%20States%20hardiness%20zones\"&gt;USDA hardiness zone&lt;/a&gt; 6a.\nTypically, summers are hot, humid, and wet. Winters are generally cold with moderate snowfall. The July daily average temperature is . High temperatures reach or exceed an average of 18 days each year, and occasionally exceed .

On January 11, 1820, the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;Indiana General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital, appointing &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Ralston\"&gt;Alexander Ralston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elias%20Pym%20Fordham\"&gt;Elias Pym Fordham&lt;/a&gt; to survey and design a town plan for Indianapolis. Ralston had been a surveyor for the French architect &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20L%27Enfant\"&gt;Pierre L'Enfant&lt;/a&gt;, assisting him with the &lt;a href=\"L%27Enfant%20Plan\"&gt;plan for Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; Ralston's original plan for Indianapolis called for a town of , near the &lt;a href=\"confluence\"&gt;confluence&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"White%20River%20%28Indiana%29\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fall%20Creek%20%28Indiana%29\"&gt;Fall Creek&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe plan, known as the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Indianapolis\"&gt;Mile Square&lt;/a&gt;, is bounded by East, West, North, and South streets, centered on a &lt;a href=\"traffic%20circle\"&gt;traffic circle&lt;/a&gt;, called Monument Circle (originally Governor's Circle), from which Indianapolis's \"Circle City\" nickname originated. Four diagonal streets radiated a block from Monument Circle: &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Avenue%2C%20Indianapolis\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, Virginia, Kentucky, and &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Avenue\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; avenues. The city's address numbering system begins at the intersection of &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Street%20%28Indianapolis%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meridian%20Street%20%28Indianapolis%29\"&gt;Meridian&lt;/a&gt; streets. Before its submersion into a sanitary tunnel, &lt;a href=\"Pogue%27s%20Run\"&gt;Pogue's Run&lt;/a&gt; was included into the plan, disrupting the rectilinear street grid to the southeast.\nCompared with similar-sized American cities, Indianapolis is unique in that it contains some 200 farms covering thousands of acres of agricultural land within its municipal boundaries. Equestrian farms and corn and soybean fields interspersed with suburban development are commonplace on the city's periphery, especially in &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Township%2C%20Marion%20County%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Franklin Township&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitecture.\nNoted as one of the finest examples of the &lt;a href=\"City%20Beautiful%20movement\"&gt;City Beautiful movement&lt;/a&gt; design in the U.S., the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20World%20War%20Memorial%20Plaza\"&gt;Indiana World War Memorial Plaza Historic District&lt;/a&gt; began construction in 1921 in downtown Indianapolis. The district, a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt;, encompasses several examples of &lt;a href=\"neoclassical%20architecture\"&gt;neoclassical architecture&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"American%20Legion\"&gt;American Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Public%20Library%23Central%20Library\"&gt;Central Library&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Birch%20Bayh%20Federal%20Building%20and%20United%20States%20Courthouse\"&gt;Birch Bayh Federal Building and United States Courthouse&lt;/a&gt;. The district is also home to several sculptures and memorials, \"&lt;a href=\"Depew%20Memorial%20Fountain\"&gt;Depew Memorial Fountain&lt;/a&gt;\", and open space, hosting many annual civic events.\nAfter completion of the &lt;a href=\"Soldiers%27%20and%20Sailors%27%20Monument%20%28Indianapolis%29\"&gt;Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument&lt;/a&gt;, an ordinance was passed in 1905 &lt;a href=\"Height%20restriction%20laws\"&gt;restricting building heights&lt;/a&gt; on the traffic circle to to protect views of the monument. The ordinance was revised in 1922, permitting buildings to rise to , with an additional allowable with a series of &lt;a href=\"setback%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;setback&lt;/a&gt;s. A citywide height restriction ordinance was instituted in 1912, barring structures over . Completed in 1962, the &lt;a href=\"City-County%20Building%20%28Indianapolis%29\"&gt;City-County Building&lt;/a&gt; was the first skyscraper in the city, surpassing the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in height by nearly . A &lt;a href=\"building%20boom\"&gt;building boom&lt;/a&gt;, lasting from 1982 to 1990, saw the construction of six of the city's ten tallest buildings. The tallest is &lt;a href=\"Salesforce%20Tower%20%28Indianapolis%29\"&gt;Salesforce Tower&lt;/a&gt;, completed in 1990 at . &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20limestone\"&gt;Indiana limestone&lt;/a&gt; is the signature building material in Indianapolis, widely included in the city's many monuments, churches, academic, government, and civic buildings.\nNeighborhoods.\nFor statistical purposes, the consolidated city-county is organized into 99 \"neighborhood areas\" with most containing numerous individual historic and cultural districts, subdivisions, and some semi-autonomous towns. In total, some 500 self-identified neighborhood associations are registered in the City\u2019s Registered Community Organization system. As a result of the city's expansive land area, Indianapolis has a unique &lt;a href=\"Transect%20%28urban%29\"&gt;urban-to-rural transect&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from dense urban neighborhoods to suburban &lt;a href=\"tract%20housing\"&gt;tract housing&lt;/a&gt; subdivisions, to rural villages.\nTypical of American cities in the Midwest, Indianapolis urbanized in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, resulting in the development of relatively dense, well-defined neighborhoods clustered around streetcar corridors, especially in &lt;a href=\"Center%20Township%2C%20Marion%20County%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Center Township&lt;/a&gt;. Notable &lt;a href=\"streetcar%20suburb\"&gt;streetcar suburb&lt;/a&gt;s include &lt;a href=\"Broad%20Ripple%20Village%2C%20Indianapolis\"&gt;Broad Ripple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Irvington%20Historic%20District%20%28Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana%29\"&gt;Irvington&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"University%20Heights%2C%20Indianapolis\"&gt;University Heights&lt;/a&gt;. Starting in the mid-20th century, the &lt;a href=\"post%E2%80%93World%20War%20II%20economic%20expansion\"&gt;post\u2013World War II economic expansion&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent &lt;a href=\"suburbanization\"&gt;suburbanization&lt;/a&gt; greatly influenced the city's development patterns. From 1950 to 1970, nearly 100,000 housing units were built in Marion County, most outside Center Township in suburban neighborhoods such as &lt;a href=\"Castleton%2C%20Indianapolis\"&gt;Castleton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eagledale%2C%20Indianapolis\"&gt;Eagledale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nora%2C%20Indianapolis\"&gt;Nora&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the 2000s, &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Indianapolis\"&gt;Downtown Indianapolis&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding neighborhoods have seen increased reinvestment mirroring nationwide market trends, driven by &lt;a href=\"empty%20nesters\"&gt;empty nesters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"millennials\"&gt;millennials&lt;/a&gt;. Renewed interest in urban living has been met with some dispute regarding &lt;a href=\"gentrification\"&gt;gentrification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"affordable%20housing\"&gt;affordable housing&lt;/a&gt;. According to a Center for Community Progress report, neighborhoods like &lt;a href=\"Cottage%20Home%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Cottage Home&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fall%20Creek%20Place%2C%20Indianapolis\"&gt;Fall Creek Place&lt;/a&gt; have experienced measurable gentrification since 2000. The &lt;a href=\"North%20Meridian%20Street%20Historic%20District\"&gt;North Meridian Street Historic District&lt;/a&gt; is among &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20highest-income%20urban%20neighborhoods%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;the most affluent urban neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., with a mean &lt;a href=\"household%20income\"&gt;household income&lt;/a&gt; of $102,599 in 2017.\nParkland.\nIndianapolis maintains 212 public parks covering of green space, representing about 5.1% of the city's land area. Amenities include 129 playgrounds, 155 sports fields, of recreational trails, 23 recreation and nature centers, 21 spraygrounds, 19 aquatic centers, 13 golf courses, and four dog parks. The department also provides 2,400 programs and classes annually. &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Creek%20Park\"&gt;Eagle Creek Park&lt;/a&gt; is the largest and most visited park in the city and ranks among the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20urban%20parks%20by%20size\"&gt;largest municipal parks in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, covering .\n&lt;a href=\"Military%20Park%20%28Indianapolis%29\"&gt;Military Park&lt;/a&gt; was established as the city's first state-owned park in 1852. &lt;a href=\"Garfield%20Park%20%28Indianapolis%29\"&gt;Garfield Park&lt;/a&gt; was the city's first municipally-owned park, opening in 1876 as Southern Park. In the early-20th century, the city enlisted landscape architect &lt;a href=\"George%20Kessler\"&gt;George Kessler&lt;/a&gt; to conceive a framework for Indianapolis's modern parks system. Kessler's 1909 &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Park%20and%20Boulevard%20System\"&gt;Indianapolis Park and Boulevard Plan&lt;/a&gt; linked notable parks, such as &lt;a href=\"Brookside%20Park%20%28Indianapolis%29\"&gt;Brookside&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Irvington%20Historic%20District%20%28Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana%29%23Parks\"&gt;Ellenberger&lt;/a&gt;, Garfield, and &lt;a href=\"Riverside%20Park%20%28Indianapolis%29\"&gt;Riverside&lt;/a&gt; parks, with a system of parkways following the city's waterways. The system's were added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 2003.\nMarion County is home to two &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Indiana%20state%20parks\"&gt;Indiana state parks&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Harrison%20State%20Park\"&gt;Fort Harrison State Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"White%20River%20State%20Park\"&gt;White River State Park&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Indianapolis.

Founded in 1821 as the city's &lt;a href=\"Marketplaces%23Types\"&gt;public market&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20City%20Market\"&gt;Indianapolis City Market&lt;/a&gt; has served the community from its current building since 1886. Prior to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the City Market and neighboring &lt;a href=\"Tomlinson%20Hall\"&gt;Tomlinson Hall&lt;/a&gt; (since demolished) were home to meat and vegetable vendors. As consumer habits evolved and residents moved from the central city, the City Market transitioned from a traditional marketplace to a &lt;a href=\"food%20court\"&gt;food court&lt;/a&gt;, a function it retains today.\nSituated in the &lt;a href=\"Corn%20Belt\"&gt;Corn Belt&lt;/a&gt;, Indianapolis has maintained close ties to farming and food production. &lt;a href=\"Urban%20agriculture\"&gt;Urban agriculture&lt;/a&gt; in the city dates to the 1930s, when non-profit organization &lt;a href=\"Flanner%20House\"&gt;Flanner House&lt;/a&gt; began teaching Black arrivals how to farm on vacant lots during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29\"&gt;Great Migration&lt;/a&gt;. Within a few years, more than 200 families were tending 600 garden plots on nearly of urban land on the city's near north side. Urban agriculture has made a comeback in recent years in an effort to alleviate &lt;a href=\"food%20deserts\"&gt;food deserts&lt;/a&gt;. According to the city's Office of Sustainability, there were 129 community farms and gardens in 2020. , several &lt;a href=\"farmers%27%20market\"&gt;farmers' market&lt;/a&gt;s have been established throughout Indianapolis.\nDistinctive local dishes include &lt;a href=\"pork%20tenderloin%20sandwich\"&gt;pork tenderloin sandwich&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cream%20pie\"&gt;sugar cream pie&lt;/a&gt;, the latter being the unofficial state pie of Indiana. The &lt;a href=\"beef%20Manhattan\"&gt;beef Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, invented in Indianapolis, can also be found on restaurant menus throughout the city and region.\nOpened in 1902, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Elmo%20Steak%20House\"&gt;St. Elmo Steak House&lt;/a&gt; is well known for its signature &lt;a href=\"prawn%20cocktail\"&gt;shrimp cocktail&lt;/a&gt;, named by the &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Channel\"&gt;Travel Channel&lt;/a&gt; as the \"world's spiciest food\". In 2012, it was recognized by the &lt;a href=\"James%20Beard%20Foundation\"&gt;James Beard Foundation&lt;/a&gt; as one of \"America's Classics\". The &lt;a href=\"Slippery%20Noodle%20Inn\"&gt;Slippery Noodle Inn&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt; bar and restaurant, is the oldest continuously operating tavern in Indiana, having opened in 1850. The &lt;a href=\"Jazz%20Kitchen\"&gt;Jazz Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, opened in 1994, was recognized in 2011 by &lt;a href=\"OpenTable\"&gt;OpenTable&lt;/a&gt; as one of the \"top 50 late night dining hotspots\" in the U.S.\nIn 2016, \"&lt;a href=\"Cond%C3%A9%20Nast%20Traveler\"&gt;Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler&lt;/a&gt;\" named Indianapolis the \"most underrated food city in the U.S.,\" while ranking Milktooth as one of the best restaurants in the world. \"&lt;a href=\"Food%20%26amp%3B%20Wine\"&gt;Food &amp; Wine&lt;/a&gt;\" called Indianapolis the \"rising star of the Midwest,\" recognizing Milktooth, Rook, Amelia's, and Bluebeard, all in &lt;a href=\"Fletcher%20Place\"&gt;Fletcher Place&lt;/a&gt;. Several Indianapolis chefs and restaurateurs have been semifinalists in the &lt;a href=\"James%20Beard%20Foundation%20Award\"&gt;James Beard Foundation Award&lt;/a&gt;s in recent years. &lt;a href=\"Microbreweries\"&gt;Microbreweries&lt;/a&gt; are quickly becoming a staple in the city, increasing fivefold since 2009. There are now about 50 craft brewers in Indianapolis, with &lt;a href=\"Sun%20King%20Brewing\"&gt;Sun King Brewing&lt;/a&gt; being the largest.\nFor some time, Indianapolis was known as the \"100 Percent American City\" for its racial and ethnic homogeneity. Historically, these factors, as well as low taxes and wages, provided &lt;a href=\"chain%20restaurant\"&gt;chain restaurant&lt;/a&gt;s a relatively stable market to test dining preferences before expanding nationwide. As a result, the Indianapolis metropolitan area had the highest concentration of chain restaurants per capita of any market in the U.S. in 2008, with one chain restaurant for every 1,459 people\u201444% higher than the national average. In recent years, immigrants have opened some 800 ethnic restaurants.\nFilm and television.\nIndianapolis natives have left a mark on the entertainment industry, most notably during the &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Hollywood%20cinema\"&gt;Classical Hollywood cinema&lt;/a&gt; era. &lt;a href=\"James%20Baskett\"&gt;James Baskett&lt;/a&gt; received an &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Honorary%20Award\"&gt;Academy Honorary Award&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"20th%20Academy%20Awards\"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt; for his role in &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney\"&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20the%20South\"&gt;Song of the South&lt;/a&gt;\", becoming the first Black male to receive an Oscar. &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Grauman\"&gt;Sid Grauman&lt;/a&gt;, one of the founders of the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, also received an Academy Honorary Award in &lt;a href=\"20th%20Academy%20Awards\"&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt;, recognized for raising the standard for film exhibition.

Many functions of the city and county governments are consolidated, though some remain separate. The city has a &lt;a href=\"Mayor%E2%80%93council%20government%23Strong-mayor%20form\"&gt;strong mayor\u2013council&lt;/a&gt; form of government overseeing six administrative departments.

In the &lt;a href=\"2000%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2000 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, Marion County voters narrowly selected &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Al%20Gore\"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of 1.3%, but voted in favor of &lt;a href=\"John%20Kerry\"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of 1.9% in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2004 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. Presidential election results have increasingly favored Democrats, with Marion County voters selecting &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Biden\"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2020 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, 63.3\u201334.3%.

The &lt;a href=\"2019%20Indianapolis%20City-County%20Council%20election\"&gt;2019 City-County Council elections&lt;/a&gt; expanded Democratic control of the council, flipping six seats to hold a 20\u20135 &lt;a href=\"supermajority\"&gt;supermajority&lt;/a&gt; over Republicans.\nPublic safety.\nPolice and law enforcement.\nIndianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) is the primary &lt;a href=\"law%20enforcement%20agency\"&gt;law enforcement agency&lt;/a&gt; for the city of Indianapolis.
