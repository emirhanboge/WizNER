    "text": "Mequon () is the largest city in &lt;a href=\"Ozaukee%20County%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Ozaukee County&lt;/a&gt;, in the U.S. state of &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, and the third-largest city in Wisconsin by land area. Located on &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Michigan\"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt;'s western shore with significant commercial developments along &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2043\"&gt;Interstate 43&lt;/a&gt;, the community is a &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Milwaukee metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being an incorporated city, approximately half of Mequon's land is undeveloped and agriculture plays a significant role in the local economy. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt; the population was 23,132.\nWhen the first white settlers arrived in the 1830s, the Mequon area was inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Menominee\"&gt;Menominee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sauk%20people\"&gt;Sauk people&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1840s, German immigrants settled in the community, building farms and hydropowered mills along the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20River\"&gt;Milwaukee River&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the community remained rural, while &lt;a href=\"Thiensville%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Thiensville&lt;/a&gt; developed as a market town along the local railway, providing services to the farmers. Thiensville incorporated as a village in 1910. Mequon remained rural in the early 20th century but experienced significant population growth during the &lt;a href=\"suburbanization\"&gt;suburbanization&lt;/a&gt; that followed World War II. The community &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20corporation\"&gt;incorporated&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Administrative%20divisions%20of%20Wisconsin%23City\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in 1957 to avoid annexation by the City of &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee\"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;. The City of Mequon completely surrounds Thiensville, leading some residents to call Thiensville \"Mequon's donut hole.\" The two municipalities have a close relationship, with a shared chamber of commerce, library, and school district.\n&lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutheranism&lt;/a&gt; has played a significant role in Mequon since the community's early years. Some of the first German settlers were &lt;a href=\"Old%20Lutherans\"&gt;Old Lutherans&lt;/a&gt; who founded the Freistadt community \u2013 now a neighborhood in western Mequon \u2013 in 1839 and went on to form the first Lutheran congregation in Wisconsin. In the 21st century, there are more Lutheran churches in Mequon than churches of any other single denomination. Additionally, Mequon is home to two private Lutheran &lt;a href=\"higher%20education\"&gt;post-secondary&lt;/a&gt; institutions: &lt;a href=\"Concordia%20University%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Concordia University Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20Lutheran%20Seminary\"&gt;Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to having other Christian denominations, Mequon is the northernmost of Milwaukee's suburbs to have a sizable Jewish community.\nToponymy.\n\"Mequon\" may have come from the &lt;a href=\"Ojibwe%20language\"&gt;Ojibwe&lt;/a&gt; word \"Emikwaan\" or \"Miguan\", meaning ladle, referring to the shape of the river in the area. Alternatively, the name may come from a &lt;a href=\"Menominee%20language\"&gt;Menominee&lt;/a&gt; word \"M\u0113kon\", meaning \"feather.\"\nHistory.\nThe area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the &lt;a href=\"Menominee\"&gt;Menominee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sauk%20people\"&gt;Sauk people&lt;/a&gt;. In the early 19th century, the Potawatomi had a village in present-day &lt;a href=\"Thiensville%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Thiensville&lt;/a&gt; located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road. In 1832, the Menominee surrendered the land between the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20River\"&gt;Milwaukee River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Michigan\"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt; to the United States Federal Government through the \"&lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Washington%2C%20with%20Menominee%20%281831%29\"&gt;Treaty of Washington&lt;/a&gt;\". The Potawatomi surrendered the area of Mequon west of the Milwaukee River in 1833 through the \"&lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;Treaty of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;\", which required them to leave the area by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, some chose to remain, and were referred to as \"strolling Potawatomi\" in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by &lt;a href=\"squatting\"&gt;squatting&lt;/a&gt; on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20County%20Potawatomi%20Community\"&gt;Forest County Potawatomi Community&lt;/a&gt;.\nEuropean trappers, explorers, and traders used the Milwaukee River through the middle of what is now Mequon as a means of transportation. The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the &lt;a href=\"Isham%20Day%20House\"&gt;Isham Day House&lt;/a&gt;, constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.\nFreistadt.\nIn October 1839, a party of twenty German families from &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Pomerania%20%281815%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;Pomerania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were &lt;a href=\"Old%20Lutherans\"&gt;Old Lutherans&lt;/a&gt; who had resisted the Prussian government's attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20Union%20of%20Churches\"&gt;Prussian Union of Churches&lt;/a&gt;. In German, \"Freistadt\" means \"Free City\".\nIn 1840, they built a log cabin church, which they named Trinity Lutheran Church. It was the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, what would become the &lt;a href=\"Lutheran%20Synod%20of%20Buffalo\"&gt;Lutheran Synod of Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; was organized in Freistadt. However, the Freistadt church became a part of the &lt;a href=\"Lutheran%20Church%E2%80%93Missouri%20Synod\"&gt;Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod&lt;/a&gt; in 1848. The wooden church was replaced with a limestone building in 1884.\nThiensville.\nJoachim Heinrich Thien moved to the area in 1842 from &lt;a href=\"Oldenburg%20in%20Holstein\"&gt;Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, and helped design a plan for the settlement that would become &lt;a href=\"Thiensville%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Thiensville&lt;/a&gt;. A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846, and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.\nThien was a &lt;a href=\"Freethought\"&gt;freethinker&lt;/a&gt;, as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.\nThiensville grew in part because of its location on the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%2C%20Milwaukee%2C%20St.%20Paul%20and%20Pacific%20Railroad\"&gt;Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway&lt;/a&gt;, which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.\nIn 1945, eighty German &lt;a href=\"prisoner%20of%20war\"&gt;prisoners of war&lt;/a&gt; from Camp Fredonia in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Kohler%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Little Kohler, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; were contracted to work at the Herbert A. Nieman Canning Company in the village to make up for the loss of labor due to local men fighting in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. German prisoners from Camp Rockfield in &lt;a href=\"Rockfield%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Rockfield, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, (located in present-day &lt;a href=\"Germantown%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Germantown&lt;/a&gt;) also worked at the Fromm Bros., Nieman &amp; Co. Fox Ranch in northern Mequon.\nIn the 20th century, Mequon and the village of Theinsville developed a close relationship, with a shared school district, chamber of commerce, and library.\nCity of Mequon.\nThe Town of Mequon experienced significant population growth during the &lt;a href=\"suburbanization\"&gt;suburbanization&lt;/a&gt; that followed World War II. Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee\"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt; would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's &lt;a href=\"Lake%2C%20Milwaukee%20County%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Town of Lake&lt;/a&gt; in 1954 and &lt;a href=\"Granville%2C%20Milwaukee\"&gt;Town of Granville&lt;/a&gt; in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.\nThe city continued to grow with the construction of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2043\"&gt;Interstate 43&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier. Despite being a city, much of Mequon remains rural, and nearly half of the land in the community is undeveloped.\nGeography.\nMequon is located at (43.224243, \u221287.960094), about north of Milwaukee and is part of the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%E2%80%93Racine%E2%80%93Waukesha%20Metropolitan%20Area\"&gt;Milwaukee metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. As of 2005, Mequon was the third-largest city in terms of land area in the state of &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. Though much of the population lives in residential areas, approximately half of the land within the city's boundaries is undeveloped or farmed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thiensville%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Village of Thiensville&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"Enclave%20and%20exclave\"&gt;enclave&lt;/a&gt; in central Mequon. The city is also bordered by the &lt;a href=\"Cedarburg%20%28town%29%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Town of Cedarburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cedarburg%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;City of Cedarburg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grafton%20%28town%29%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Town of Grafton&lt;/a&gt; to the north; &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Michigan\"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt; to the east; the &lt;a href=\"Bayside%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Village of Bayside&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"River%20Hills%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Village of River Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Deer%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Village of Brown Deer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee\"&gt;City of Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt; to the south; and the &lt;a href=\"Germantown%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Village of Germantown&lt;/a&gt; to the west.\nThe city is located on the western shore of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Michigan\"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, and the coastline is characterized by clay &lt;a href=\"Cliff\"&gt;bluffs&lt;/a&gt; ranging from 80 feet (24 meters) to 140 feet (43 meters) in height with deep &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt;s where streams flow into the lake. Clay bluffs are a geological formation characteristic of the Lake Michigan shoreline, and are found in few other areas of the world. Much of the coast has mixed gravel and sand beaches.\nThe city is located in the &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Wisconsin%20Till%20Plains%20%28ecoregion%29\"&gt;Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains&lt;/a&gt; that were created by the &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20glaciation\"&gt;Wisconsin glaciation&lt;/a&gt; during the most recent ice age. The soil is clayey glacial &lt;a href=\"till\"&gt;till&lt;/a&gt; with a thin layer of &lt;a href=\"loess\"&gt;loess&lt;/a&gt; on the surface. The city has some &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; deposits, including the &lt;a href=\"Devonian\"&gt;Devonian&lt;/a&gt; Thiensville formation in north-central Mequon and the &lt;a href=\"Silurian\"&gt;Silurian&lt;/a&gt; Little Menomonee River Reef District, which contains &lt;a href=\"Dolomite%20%28rock%29\"&gt;dolomite&lt;/a&gt; marine fossils. The &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20Department%20of%20Natural%20Resources\"&gt;Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; considers the eastern part of the city along the lake to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape, while the western part of the city is in the Southern Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20River\"&gt;Milwaukee River&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"tributary\"&gt;tributary&lt;/a&gt; Pigeon Creek flow through the eastern part of the city. Little Menomonee Creek and the Little Menomonee River, which are tributaries of the &lt;a href=\"Menomonee%20River\"&gt;Menomonee River&lt;/a&gt;, flow through western Mequon.\nBefore white settlers arrived in the area, Mequon was an upland forest dominated by &lt;a href=\"Fagus%20grandifolia\"&gt;American beech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acer%20saccharum\"&gt;sugar maple&lt;/a&gt; trees. There is also a large &lt;a href=\"Larix%20laricina\"&gt;tamarack&lt;/a&gt; swamp along the Little Menomonee River. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture.\nAs land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Mequon. Large mammals, including &lt;a href=\"white-tailed%20deer\"&gt;white-tailed deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coyotes\"&gt;coyotes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"red%20fox\"&gt;red fox&lt;/a&gt;es can be seen in the city. Many birds, including &lt;a href=\"chimney%20swift\"&gt;chimney swift&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"great%20blue%20heron\"&gt;great blue heron&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"wild%20turkey\"&gt;wild turkey&lt;/a&gt;s are found in the city. The city is also home to many rare and notable species, including the state-designated endangered &lt;a href=\"Pterospora\"&gt;pinedrops&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plantago%20cordata\"&gt;heartleaf plantain&lt;/a&gt;; threatened &lt;a href=\"Eurybia%20furcata\"&gt;forked aster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trillium%20nivale\"&gt;snow trillium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gentiana%20alba\"&gt;yellow gentian&lt;/a&gt;; as well as &lt;a href=\"Lithospermum%20latifolium\"&gt;American gromwell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jeffersonia\"&gt;twinleaf&lt;/a&gt;, which are state-designated special concern plant species.\nThe region struggles with many invasive species, including the &lt;a href=\"emerald%20ash%20borer\"&gt;emerald ash borer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"common%20carp\"&gt;common carp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phalaris%20arundinacea\"&gt;reed canary grass&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Phragmites\"&gt;common reed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lythrum%20salicaria\"&gt;purple loosestrife&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliaria%20petiolata\"&gt;garlic mustard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhamnus%20%28plant%29\"&gt;Eurasian buckthorns&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"honeysuckle\"&gt;honeysuckle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nClimate.\nMequon experiences four distinct &lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;s, with variation in precipitation and temperature being very wide. The warmest month of the year tends to be July, when the high temperature averages 81\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C), with low temperatures of approximately 59\u00a0\u00b0F (15\u00a0\u00b0C). January is the coldest month in Mequon, with average high temperatures averaging only 27\u00a0\u00b0F (-3\u00a0\u00b0C), and lows averaging 11\u00a0\u00b0F (-12\u00a0\u00b0C). The highest temperature ever recorded in Mequon was 105\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 24, 1935, and again on July 17, 1995. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was -40\u00a0\u00b0F (-40\u00a0\u00b0C), on January 17, 1982, also known as &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Sunday\"&gt;Cold Sunday&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemographics.\n2010 census.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2010, there were 23,132 people, 8,598 households, and 6,561 families residing in the city.

Some farmsteads from as early as the 1840s and 1850s still stand in the community and are listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;. The first major businesses were hydropowered mills on the Milwaukee River and other businesses that served local farmers, many of which concentrated in Thiensville.\nBeginning in the 1920s, the Nieman and Fromm families began &lt;a href=\"fur%20farming\"&gt;fur farming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silver%20fox%20%28animal%29\"&gt;silver foxes&lt;/a&gt; in Mequon. Several companies, including Fromm Bros., Nieman &amp; Co.; Federal Silver Fox Farms, Inc.; Ozaukee Fur Farms Co.; Herbert A. Nieman &amp; Co.; and Cedarburg Fox Farms, Inc. all began operating in Mequon and southern Cedarburg in the 1920s. In 1928, 6600 of the 8841 pelts sold by the New York Auction Co. came from the Fromm and Nieman operations in Wisconsin for a record-breaking sum of $1,021,000. In 1929, the Nieman and Fromm operations broke their own record with auction sales of $1,331,679, making them a leader in the national fur industry. By 1937, the farms were selling 30,000 pelts per year. After World War II, changing consumer tastes caused the farms to begin breeding &lt;a href=\"mink\"&gt;mink&lt;/a&gt; in addition to silver fox. Fur sales declined later in the 20th century, and the Mequon farms sold their last pelts in 1985.\nThe mid-to-late 20th century saw diversification in Mequon's economy. Retail stores opened to serve the increasingly suburban community, and manufacturers opened plants. In 1983, &lt;a href=\"Concordia%20University%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Concordia University Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; moved from its campus in Milwaukee to a newly acquired campus in Mequon. In 1994, St. Mary's Hospital Ozaukee opened. As of 2015, the two institutions\u2014both located in close proximity to &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2043\"&gt;Interstate 43&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were among the largest employers in Ozaukee County. Despite the growth of new industries, half of Mequon's land remains undeveloped and agriculture continues to play a significant role in the local economy.\nCulture.\nLibraries.\nThe Frank L. Weyenberg Library is a public library serving Mequon and Thiensville. In addition to its collection of physical media, the library provides patrons with digital resources and meeting space. In 2018, the library made 307,796 loans to patrons. The library is a member of the Monarch Library System, comprising thirty-one libraries in Ozaukee, Sheboygan, Washington, and Dodge counties.\nThe Rincker Memorial Library at &lt;a href=\"Concordia%20University%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Concordia University Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; is a private research library with a collection of over 100,000 physical books and 400 scholarly journals.

The oldest item in the collection is a 1487 edition of a &lt;a href=\"Exegesis\"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20of%20Lyra\"&gt;Nicholas of Lyra&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\n&lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutheranism&lt;/a&gt; has played an important role in Mequon since the community's earliest years. In 1840, a group of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Lutherans\"&gt;Old Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; immigrants from &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt; established Trinity Lutheran Church of Freistadt, the first Lutheran congregation in Wisconsin. In 1845, the &lt;a href=\"Lutheran%20Synod%20of%20Buffalo\"&gt;Lutheran Synod of Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, one of the predecessor organizations of the modern &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20in%20America\"&gt;Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA)&lt;/a&gt;, formed in Freistadt.\nAs of 2020, four churches \u2014 Christ Alone Evangelical; Christ Alone Evangelical, North Campus; St. John's Evangelical; and Trinity (West Mequon) \u2013 are affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Synod\"&gt;Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod&lt;/a&gt; (WELS).

The two parishes merged in 1984 to form Lumen Christi Catholic Church, although the church maintained two campuses until December 2019, when a new, larger church and school facility opened to serve all of Mequon's congregants. The parish operates a school for students from kindergarten through eighth grade.\nThe metro-Milwaukee area's &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jewish community&lt;/a&gt; is concentrated on Milwaukee's upper east side and in the suburbs north of the city along Lake Michigan. Mequon is the northernmost suburb with a significant Jewish presence. There are two &lt;a href=\"synagogue\"&gt;synagogue&lt;/a&gt;s in Mequon: the &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20Judaism\"&gt;Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; Congregation Anshai Lebowitz and the Peltz Center for Jewish Life, which is affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Chabad\"&gt;Chabad&lt;/a&gt; movement.
