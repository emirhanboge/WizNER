    "text": "\"Piggies\" is a song by the English rock band &lt;a href=\"the%20Beatles\"&gt;the Beatles&lt;/a&gt; from their 1968 album \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles%20%28album%29\"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt;\" (also known as \"the White Album\"). Written by &lt;a href=\"George%20Harrison\"&gt;George Harrison&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"social%20commentary\"&gt;social commentary&lt;/a&gt;, the song serves as an &lt;a href=\"Orwellian\"&gt;Orwellian&lt;/a&gt; satire on greed and consumerism. Among several elements it incorporates from &lt;a href=\"classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt;, the track features &lt;a href=\"harpsichord\"&gt;harpsichord&lt;/a&gt; and orchestral strings in the &lt;a href=\"baroque%20pop\"&gt;baroque pop&lt;/a&gt; style, which are contrasted by Harrison's acerbic lyrics and the sound of grunting pigs. Although credited to &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Thomas%20%28record%20producer%29\"&gt;George Martin&lt;/a&gt;, the recording was largely produced by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Thomas%20%28record%20producer%29\"&gt;Chris Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, who also contributed the harpsichord part.\nIn the context of the &lt;a href=\"Protests%20of%201968\"&gt;turbulent political climate of 1968&lt;/a&gt;, \"Piggies\" was adopted by the &lt;a href=\"Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s\"&gt;counterculture&lt;/a&gt; as an anti-establishment theme song. It was also among the tracks on \"The Beatles\" that cult leader &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Manson\"&gt;Charles Manson&lt;/a&gt; used as the foundation for his &lt;a href=\"Helter%20Skelter%20%28Manson%20scenario%29\"&gt;Helter Skelter theory&lt;/a&gt; of an American race-related countercultural revolution. Inspired especially by the line \"What they need's a damn good whacking\", Manson's followers left clues relating to the lyrics at the scenes of the &lt;a href=\"Sharon%20Tate\"&gt;Tate&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Leno%20LaBianca\"&gt;LaBianca&lt;/a&gt; murders in August 1969.\n\"Piggies\" has received widely varying responses from music critics, and its reputation suffered due to the association with Manson following the latter's trial in 1971. While some reviewers admire its musical qualities and recognise sardonic humour in the lyrics, others consider the song to be mean-spirited and lacking in subtlety. Harrison's &lt;a href=\"Demo%20%28music%29\"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; of the song, recorded at his home in &lt;a href=\"Surrey\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt;, was included on the Beatles' 1996 compilation \"&lt;a href=\"Anthology%203\"&gt;Anthology 3&lt;/a&gt;\". A live version by Harrison, reinstating a verse that was omitted from the studio recording, appears on his 1992 album \"&lt;a href=\"Live%20in%20Japan%20%28George%20Harrison%20album%29\"&gt;Live in Japan&lt;/a&gt;\". Folk singer and activist &lt;a href=\"Theo%20Bikel\"&gt;Theo Bikel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anarcho-punk\"&gt;anarcho-punk&lt;/a&gt; musician &lt;a href=\"Danbert%20Nobacon\"&gt;Danbert Nobacon&lt;/a&gt; are among the artists who have covered \"Piggies\".\nBackground and inspiration.\n&lt;a href=\"George%20Harrison\"&gt;George Harrison&lt;/a&gt; began writing \"Piggies\" in early 1966, around the time that &lt;a href=\"the%20Beatles\"&gt;the Beatles&lt;/a&gt; were recording their album \"&lt;a href=\"Revolver%20%28Beatles%20album%29\"&gt;Revolver&lt;/a&gt;\". He returned to the song two years later, after discovering his manuscript in the attic of his parents' house in Liverpool. The same visit led to Harrison starting a new composition, \"&lt;a href=\"While%20My%20Guitar%20Gently%20Weeps\"&gt;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&lt;/a&gt;\", which he similarly completed for inclusion on the Beatles' &lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles%20%28album%29\"&gt;self-titled double album&lt;/a&gt; (also known as \"the White Album\").\nAs an anti-establishment song, \"Piggies\" recalls Harrison's \"Revolver\" composition \"&lt;a href=\"Taxman\"&gt;Taxman&lt;/a&gt;\". In his 1980 autobiography, \"&lt;a href=\"I%2C%20Me%2C%20Mine\"&gt;I, Me, Mine&lt;/a&gt;\", Harrison describes \"Piggies\" as a &lt;a href=\"social%20commentary\"&gt;social commentary&lt;/a&gt;. He intended it as a light-hearted satire on consumerism and class distinction. Through its theme of social strata within a community of farm animals (in this case, one consisting entirely of pigs), the song references &lt;a href=\"George%20Orwell\"&gt;George Orwell&lt;/a&gt;'s 1945 novel \"&lt;a href=\"Animal%20Farm\"&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/a&gt;\". According to Harrison's early draft of \"Piggies\", the lyrics contained a final verse, subsequently cut for the Beatles' recording, that ends with the animals \"Paying piggy thanks \u2013 to thee Pig Brother!\" Musicologist &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Everett%20%28musicologist%29\"&gt;Walter Everett&lt;/a&gt; cites these words as evidence that Harrison's main inspiration for the song was Orwell's work, particularly \"his fable of autocracy masquerading as democracy, \"Animal Farm\"\". While also identifying Orwell's book as an influence on the composition, author Ian Inglis views \"Piggies\" as one of several White Album songs in which the Beatles drew inspiration from their childhood in the 1940s.\nDuring Harrison's Liverpool visit in early 1968, his mother, Louise, responded to his request for assistance with the lyrics by providing the line \"What they need's a damn good whacking\". Harrison then taped a &lt;a href=\"Demo%20%28music%29\"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; of the song at his house in &lt;a href=\"Esher\"&gt;Esher, Surrey&lt;/a&gt;, in late May that year. Following this recording, &lt;a href=\"John%20Lennon\"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt; supplied the final phrase in the line \"Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon\", replacing the words \"to cut their pork chops\", which Harrison had sung on the demo version. When performing \"Piggies\" in concert during the early 1990s, Harrison reinstated the omitted final verse.\nFrom 1966, particularly in the United States, the slang usage of the word \"pig\" had grown from being a derogatory term for a police officer to refer also to consumerism and establishment figures in general. This was especially so in 1968, as the &lt;a href=\"Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s\"&gt;counterculture&lt;/a&gt; became more politically focused, coinciding with the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Power%20movement\"&gt;Black Power movement&lt;/a&gt; and the number of mass demonstrations against America's involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;. Although author &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Wiener\"&gt;Jon Wiener&lt;/a&gt; terms Harrison and Lennon \"the &lt;a href=\"Political%20radicalism\"&gt;radicals&lt;/a&gt; among the Beatles\", citing their past outspokenness about Vietnam and their readiness to embrace &lt;a href=\"LSD\"&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt; experimentation and &lt;a href=\"Transcendental%20Meditation\"&gt;Transcendental Meditation&lt;/a&gt;, Harrison denied that he was using \"pig\" in its new context. Inglis nevertheless says that the song title alone \"references\" the countercultural view of police officers.\nComposition.\nMusic.\n\"Piggies\" features &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20music\"&gt;baroque&lt;/a&gt; musical elements in its melody and &lt;a href=\"Texture%20%28music%29\"&gt;texture&lt;/a&gt;. Music journalist Steve Smith groups the song with the &lt;a href=\"Paul%20McCartney\"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt;-written \"&lt;a href=\"For%20No%20One\"&gt;For No One&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"She%27s%20Leaving%20Home\"&gt;She's Leaving Home&lt;/a&gt;\" as examples of the Beatles' forays into &lt;a href=\"baroque%20pop\"&gt;baroque pop&lt;/a&gt;. Harrison biographer Simon Leng recognises the composition as essentially a &lt;a href=\"Folk%20music\"&gt;folk&lt;/a&gt; song, however, that was then given a \"satirical, drawing-room [musical] arrangement\" on the official recording by the prominence of &lt;a href=\"harpsichord\"&gt;harpsichord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"String%20orchestra\"&gt;orchestral strings&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe song's &lt;a href=\"Key%20%28music%29\"&gt;musical key&lt;/a&gt; is A. Its structure comprises two verses, a &lt;a href=\"middle%20eight\"&gt;middle eight&lt;/a&gt; (or bridge) section, an instrumental passage (over the verse melody), followed by a final verse that leads into a &lt;a href=\"Coda%20%28music%29\"&gt;coda&lt;/a&gt; (or outro) and a formal ending.&lt;ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his commentary on \"Piggies\", musicologist &lt;a href=\"Alan%20W.%20Pollack\"&gt;Alan Pollack&lt;/a&gt; remarks on its abundance of &lt;a href=\"classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt; traits. These include the use of \"&lt;a href=\"arpeggio\"&gt;arpeggio&lt;/a&gt; fragments\" in Harrison's opening guitar motif and the repetition of this four-bar passage before each verse and the bridge \u2013 a device typical of &lt;a href=\"Schubert\"&gt;Schubert&lt;/a&gt;'s various &lt;a href=\"lied\"&gt;lied&lt;/a&gt;er and the works of other nineteenth-century composers. During the song, the expected cycle of fifth notes in the major scale is interrupted through the inclusion of a III7 (C7) chord, which first appears at the end of the passage leading into the middle eight, before the melody drops down a tone to the minor ii (Bm) chord. The same section's first line ends with the surprise inclusion of a &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"riff\"&gt;riff&lt;/a&gt;, soon after which the C7 chord is used again in the ascent to the IV (&lt;a href=\"subdominant\"&gt;subdominant&lt;/a&gt;) chord, helping to accentuate the phrase \"damn good whacking\".\nAs a further example of the melody's baroque characteristics, the bridge contains an implied but unfulfilled &lt;a href=\"Tonicization\"&gt;tonicisation&lt;/a&gt; of VI. In addition, over the coda, the recurring four-bar instrumental passage is partly shifted to a &lt;a href=\"parallel%20minor\"&gt;parallel minor&lt;/a&gt;, through the use of the more classically oriented Am chord, rather than its major equivalent as before. Following the instrumental coda, the song ends with the strings playing a &lt;a href=\"Ambiguity%23Music\"&gt;tonically ambiguous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cadence%20%28music%29\"&gt;cadence&lt;/a&gt;, which Everett describes as an unexpected \"&lt;a href=\"diminished%20fourth\"&gt;diminished fourth&lt;/a&gt; away from tonic\".\nLyrics.\nInglis writes that while the &lt;a href=\"nursery%20rhyme\"&gt;nursery rhyme&lt;/a&gt; form was Harrison's musical source for \"Piggies\", his lyrics adopt a political perspective, creating \"a savage attack on the corporate greed of contemporary capitalism\". In the first verse, Harrison sings of \"the little piggies\", for whom \"life is getting worse\". In verse two, \"the bigger piggies\" are described as \"stirring up\" the dirt that those smaller animals \"crawl\" in, while they themselves are dressed in \"starched white shirts\". According to music journalist Kit O'Toole, whereas the song's harpsichord-led introduction \"suggests a salon featuring royalty in their finery\", the lyrics immediately nullify this image in their depiction of pigs toiling in mud, thereby heightening the overall satirical effect. Everett comments that the same contrast between refined instrumentation and uncompromising subject matter was later adopted by &lt;a href=\"Stevie%20Wonder\"&gt;Stevie Wonder&lt;/a&gt; for his track \"Village Ghetto Land\", issued on \"&lt;a href=\"Songs%20in%20the%20Key%20of%20Life\"&gt;Songs in the Key of Life&lt;/a&gt;\" (1976).\nDuring the middle eight, Harrison refers to the privileged pigs in their &lt;a href=\"sties\"&gt;sties&lt;/a&gt; who \"don't care what goes on around\"; they appear devoid of empathy, and therefore deserve \"a damn good whacking\". In the third verse, Harrison declares that piggies are \"everywhere\", leading \"piggy lives\". He presents a final image of couples dining, holding their cutlery before devouring bacon.\nProduction.\nRecording.\nThe Beatles recorded the basic track for \"Piggies\" at EMI Studios (now &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20Road%20Studios\"&gt;Abbey Road Studios&lt;/a&gt;) in London on 19 September 1968. After Harrison had performed the song alone on the Esher demo \u2013 playing acoustic guitar and whistling over the solo \u2013 the use of harpsichord on the official recording came about through happenstance. Acting as a producer in &lt;a href=\"George%20Martin\"&gt;George Martin&lt;/a&gt;'s absence on some of the White Album sessions, &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Thomas%20%28record%20producer%29\"&gt;Chris Thomas&lt;/a&gt; noticed the instrument set up in preparation for a later session, for a classical recording, in EMI's Studio 1. Harrison agreed that a harpsichord part would suit the song, and so the Beatles' session was moved from Studio 2.\nThe group taped eleven takes of \"Piggies\" before achieving the requisite performance. The line-up was Harrison on acoustic guitar, Thomas on harpsichord, McCartney on bass and &lt;a href=\"Ringo%20Starr\"&gt;Ringo Starr&lt;/a&gt; on tambourine. Lennon was present at the session but, with only &lt;a href=\"4-track%20%28multitrack%29\"&gt;4-track recording&lt;/a&gt; facilities available in Studio 1 (and the available tracks taken up by the other four musicians), he did not play on the basic track. Having attended London's &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music\"&gt;Royal Academy of Music&lt;/a&gt; as a child, Thomas performed the harpsichord solo in an authentic classical style, according to Pollack, who highlights how \"the melody played by the last three fingers [of the right hand] alternates with a repeated note played by the thumb\".\nOverdubbing.\nOn 20 September, the recording was copied over to 8-track tape in Studio 2, to allow for &lt;a href=\"overdubbing\"&gt;overdubbing&lt;/a&gt;. Harrison then added his lead vocal, together with harmony vocals on the last verse, creating a mock &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic chorus over the latter section. Through the combination of studio effects and overdubs, his vocal performance on the song consists of three contrasting segments; in Inglis' description, these comprise a \"naturalistic\" approach at the start of the track, \"a distorted middle\", and chorus singing at the end. To produce the sharp nasal sound over the middle eight, Harrison sang through a filter that limited the signal to a narrow, 3.5-kilohertz band. Described by Everett as \"remarkable\", the pitch of Harrison's vocals in the final verse ranges from a low E bass note in one of the harmony parts, to a &lt;a href=\"descant\"&gt;descant&lt;/a&gt; falsetto B4 in the high harmony part. Lennon created a &lt;a href=\"tape%20loop\"&gt;tape loop&lt;/a&gt; of pre-recorded pig noises, sourced from EMI's library, as well as supplying his own grunting sounds. Drum beats were also added, marking the transition from the solo into the third verse.\nFinal overdubs on the song were carried out on 10 October, during the last week of recording for \"The Beatles\". Having returned from his extended holiday, Martin wrote a string arrangement for four violins, two &lt;a href=\"viola\"&gt;viola&lt;/a&gt;s and two cellos. These parts were recorded during the same orchestral overdubbing session as for Lennon's track \"&lt;a href=\"Glass%20Onion\"&gt;Glass Onion&lt;/a&gt;\". Towards the end of \"Piggies\", Harrison added the spoken words \"One more time\", before the orchestra played the last two chords. In his overview of the recording, author and critic &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Riley%20%28music%20critic%29\"&gt;Tim Riley&lt;/a&gt; interprets the \"thick &lt;a href=\"scouse\"&gt;scouse&lt;/a&gt;\" delivery of this introduction to the \"final grand cadence\" as Harrison \"smearing social elitists with their own symbols of 'high' culture\". Everett refers to the contrast between the various classical elements and the combination of pig sounds and \"rude\" final cadence as representing an \"Orwellian comparison of pigs to socially horrid, though outwardly refined, tyrants\".\n&lt;a href=\"Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29\"&gt;Mixing&lt;/a&gt; on \"Piggies\" was completed on 11 October. The &lt;a href=\"Monaural\"&gt;mono&lt;/a&gt; mix has the animal sounds appearing at different points in the song, relative to the &lt;a href=\"stereo\"&gt;stereo&lt;/a&gt; version. In addition, Harrison's guitar is more prominent in the mono mix.\nRelease and reception.\n&lt;a href=\"Apple%20Records\"&gt;Apple Records&lt;/a&gt;, the Beatles' &lt;a href=\"EMI\"&gt;EMI&lt;/a&gt;-distributed record label, released \"The Beatles\" on 22 November 1968, with \"Piggies\" sequenced as the fourth track on side two of the double &lt;a href=\"LP%20record\"&gt;LP&lt;/a&gt;. It appeared between two other songs with animal names in their titles \u2013 \"&lt;a href=\"Blackbird%20%28Beatles%20song%29\"&gt;Blackbird&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Raccoon\"&gt;Rocky Raccoon&lt;/a&gt;\".&lt;ref name=\"Gerard/PM\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The animal-themed sequencing was a deliberate decision on the part of Lennon and McCartney,&lt;ref name=\"Fontenot/About\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who prepared the running order of the album's 30 tracks, with Martin, after Harrison had left for Los Angeles to work with Apple signing &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Lomax\"&gt;Jackie Lomax&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to author &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Hertsgaard\"&gt;Mark Hertsgaard&lt;/a&gt;, \"Piggies\" \"[kept] the Beatles' countercultural flame alive\", as the song was embraced as an anti-authoritarian anthem by the counterculture, following a &lt;a href=\"Protests%20of%201968\"&gt;year of protests and civil unrest&lt;/a&gt; in many Western countries. Among many such events in the United States, &lt;a href=\"1968%20Democratic%20National%20Convention%23Protests%20and%20police%20response\"&gt;police officers clashed violently&lt;/a&gt; with anti-Vietnam War demonstrators at the &lt;a href=\"1968%20Democratic%20National%20Convention\"&gt;Democratic National Convention&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago in August 1968. &lt;a href=\"David%20A.%20Noebel\"&gt;David A. Noebel&lt;/a&gt;, an American arch-conservative, paired the song with \"&lt;a href=\"Back%20in%20the%20U.S.S.R.\"&gt;Back in the U.S.S.R.&lt;/a&gt;\" when he accused the Beatles of being pro-Communist and leading a move towards &lt;a href=\"revolutionary%20socialism\"&gt;revolutionary socialism&lt;/a&gt; with the White Album. Along with McCartney's \"Rocky Raccoon\", however, \"Piggies\" was also criticised by the radical &lt;a href=\"New%20Left\"&gt;New Left&lt;/a&gt; as an example of the Beatles resorting to whimsical parody instead of directly addressing contemporary issues.\nAmong the more conservative elements of the British establishment and the public, the release of \"The Beatles\" coincided with a less tolerant attitude towards the band. On 19 October, two days after the 24-hour session to sequence the album, Lennon, along with &lt;a href=\"Yoko%20Ono\"&gt;Yoko Ono&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested for possession of &lt;a href=\"Cannabis%20%28drug%29\"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt;; Lennon described the bust as a \"set-up\" by the London Drug Squad. During a radio interview shortly afterwards, in Los Angeles, Harrison questioned the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department\"&gt;local police department&lt;/a&gt;'s motto \"To serve and protect\" when asked about the criminality of smoking marijuana. In mid November, he represented the Beatles on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Smothers%20Brothers%20Comedy%20Hour\"&gt;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&lt;/a&gt;\", which was in conflict at the time with the &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; television network over its &lt;a href=\"political%20satire\"&gt;political satire&lt;/a&gt; and regularly subjected to censorship. Author John Winn describes Harrison's guest appearance as \"an important show of support\" following &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt;'s recent US election win.\nWriting in the \"&lt;a href=\"International%20Times\"&gt;International Times&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Miles\"&gt;Barry Miles&lt;/a&gt; found \"Piggies\" \"unsubtle\" and likely to appeal to \"those involved with Chicago's pig-police\". &lt;a href=\"William%20Mann%20%28critic%29\"&gt;William Mann&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times\"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;\" noted the recurring nature theme throughout the album, from brief mentions of monkeys, lizards, elephants and tigers, to song titles such as \"Blackbird\" and \"Piggies\", and asked of Harrison's characters: \"are they Chicago police or just company directors?\" \"&lt;a href=\"Melody%20Maker\"&gt;Melody Maker&lt;/a&gt;\"s Alan Walsh admired the instrumentation on the recording and deemed \"Piggies\" to be \"The Beatles' satire track ... a kick at upper-class reactionaries or journalists (or both)\". In his unfavourable review of the White Album, in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Jahn\"&gt;Mike Jahn&lt;/a&gt; considered that many of the tracks were \"either so corny or sung in such a way that it is hard to tell whether [the Beatles] are being serious\", among which the words of Harrison's song served as \"an act of lyrical overstatement\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Record%20Mirror\"&gt;Record Mirror&lt;/a&gt;\" remarked that the &lt;a href=\"birdsong\"&gt;birdsong&lt;/a&gt; effects of \"Blackbird\" were replaced by \"snorts and grunts\" on \"Piggies\", which the reviewer described as \"a society beef (or pork if you like)\" in the style of folk singer &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Harper%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Roy Harper&lt;/a&gt;. Writing in \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Jann%20Wenner\"&gt;Jann Wenner&lt;/a&gt; considered the song to be \"an amazing choice to follow 'Blackbird'\", given the contrast between the two pieces \u2013 \"'Blackbird' so encouraging, 'Piggies' so smug (though accurate: 'what they need's a damn good whacking'). Ha!\" Wenner paired it with Starr's \"&lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Pass%20Me%20By\"&gt;Don't Pass Me By&lt;/a&gt;\", as lesser tracks beside the \"superb numbers\" found elsewhere on the album, but added that \"on their own, they're totally groovy.\" Alan Smith of the \"&lt;a href=\"NME\"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt;\" praised the melody and the use of classical instrumentation, and described the song as \"a telling piece about modern life\" and \"a fascinating piece of humorous cynicism\".&lt;ref name=\"Smith/NME\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nCharles Manson interpretation.\nMusician and cult leader &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Manson\"&gt;Charles Manson&lt;/a&gt; interpreted several songs on \"The Beatles\" as an inducement for his followers, known as the Manson Family, to carry out a series of murders in Los Angeles in August 1969. Inspired by the line \"What they need's a damn good whacking\", Manson adopted \"Piggies\" as one of the tracks to justify such attacks on the White &lt;a href=\"bourgeoisie\"&gt;bourgeoisie&lt;/a&gt;. Believing that the Beatles were instructing him through their music, Manson envisioned these attacks as the prelude to an apocalyptic racial war between the establishment and the Black community that would leave him and his followers to rule America on counterculture principles. At the scenes of the murders of &lt;a href=\"Sharon%20Tate\"&gt;Sharon Tate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leno%20LaBianca\"&gt;Leno and Rosemary LaBianca&lt;/a&gt;, Gary Hinman and others, the words \"Political Piggy\", \"Pig\" and \"Death to Pigs\" were written on the walls with the victims' blood. In the case of Leno LaBianca, items of cutlery were inserted into his body in reference to the lyric \"Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon\".\nSpeaking to \"Rolling Stone\" co-founder &lt;a href=\"David%20Dalton%20%28writer%29\"&gt;David Dalton&lt;/a&gt; before his trial, Manson also drew parallels between the pig noises that close the track and a similar sound, followed by machine-gun fire, that appears in Lennon's White Album sound collage \"&lt;a href=\"Revolution%209\"&gt;Revolution 9&lt;/a&gt;\".&lt;ref name=\"Dalton/Gadfly\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"Dalton/RS\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Like its rival counterculture publications \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Free%20Press\"&gt;Los Angeles Free Press&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Tuesday%27s%20Child%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Tuesday's Child&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Rolling Stone\" initially supported Manson, Dalton contending that it was a case of the conservative-minded authorities &lt;a href=\"Frameup\"&gt;framing&lt;/a&gt; \"some poor hippie guru\". According to author &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Turner%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Steve Turner&lt;/a&gt;, \"Piggies\" \"became notorious\" as a result of the Manson Family's 1971 murder trial, which was successfully prosecuted by Californian attorney &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Bugliosi\"&gt;Vincent Bugliosi&lt;/a&gt;.\nHarrison was appalled at Manson's interpretation of the song. He also found it disturbing that Manson came to define the long-haired hippie type in the public's eyes, after the prosecution's case had resulted in widespread condemnation of rock music and the idealism associated with the late 1960s hippie movement.&lt;ref name=\"Paytress/FamilyMisfortunes\"&gt;Paytress, Mark. \"Family Misfortunes\". In: .&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1974 book \"&lt;a href=\"Helter%20Skelter%20%28book%29\"&gt;Helter Skelter&lt;/a&gt;\", Bugliosi says he was denied permission to quote from the lyrics of \"Piggies\" in the book, yet not so for relevant &lt;a href=\"Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney\"&gt;Lennon\u2013McCartney&lt;/a&gt; songs, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Helter%20Skelter%20%28song%29\"&gt;Helter Skelter&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Revolution%201\"&gt;Revolution 1&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Blackbird\".\nThe connection between Manson's interpretation of the White Album songs and the August 1969 murders was introduced by Bugliosi in Manson's trial. Mike McGann, the lead police investigator on the &lt;a href=\"Tate-LaBianca%20murders\"&gt;Tate-LaBianca murders&lt;/a&gt; later stated: \"Everything in Vince Bugliosi's book is wrong. I was the lead investigator on the case. Bugliosi didn't solve it. Nobody trusted him.\" Police detective Charlie Guenther, who investigated the murders, and Bugliosi's co-prosecutor Aaron Stovits have also discredited this as the motive for the murders.\nRetrospective assessment and legacy.\nWriting in 1977, &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Schaffner\"&gt;Nicholas Schaffner&lt;/a&gt; said that, despite the \"merciless stereotypes\" presented in its lyrics, \"Piggies\" and Harrison's three other White Album compositions \"firmly established him as a contender\" beside the Beatles' principal songwriters, Lennon and McCartney. Four years later, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Norman%20%28author%29\"&gt;Philip Norman&lt;/a&gt; described the song as \"mordantly humorous\". Among more recent Beatles biographers, &lt;a href=\"Ian%20MacDonald\"&gt;Ian MacDonald&lt;/a&gt; views \"Piggies\" as a \"bludgeoning satire on straight society\", dismissing it as \"dreadful\" and \"an embarrassing blot on [Harrison's] discography\".\nAccording to author Doyle Greene, writing in his 2016 book on the 1960s counterculture, the Beatles and Manson are \"permanently connected in pop-culture consciousness\" as a result of Manson having founded his theory of race war on McCartney's \"Helter Skelter\", \"Piggies\" and other tracks from the 1968 double album. In his book \"Revolution: The Making of the Beatles' White Album\", &lt;a href=\"David%20Quantick\"&gt;David Quantick&lt;/a&gt; recognises the song's musical qualities \u2013 describing it as \"a powerful song, full of angry climaxes\" with \"a fine [vocal] performance ... [and] a charming baroque feel\" \u2013 yet he bemoans its \"arrogant\" and misanthropic message. Quantick concludes: \"Although the Beatles preached peace and love and meant it, large parts of the White Album indicate that they could be a bit selective about it.\" Ian Inglis considers that the intentions behind Harrison's send-up of capitalist consumerism were reasonable, and acknowledges the sinister connotations that the song gained through Manson. He says that the track fails, however, melodically and lyrically, and lacks cohesion in its musical arrangement as well as \"any subtlety or charm\".\nReviewing Harrison's career in a 2002 issue of \"&lt;a href=\"Goldmine%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Goldmine&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Thompson%20%28author%29\"&gt;Dave Thompson&lt;/a&gt; termed \"Piggies\" \"whimsically foreboding\" and grouped it with late-period Beatles songs such as \"&lt;a href=\"Something%20%28Beatles%20song%29\"&gt;Something&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Long%2C%20Long%2C%20Long\"&gt;Long, Long, Long&lt;/a&gt;\" that anticipated Harrison's successes as a solo artist after &lt;a href=\"Break-up%20of%20the%20Beatles\"&gt;the group's break-up&lt;/a&gt; in 1970. Tim Riley describes the song's narrative as \"smug anti-elitism outdone only by the dourness of John's 'Glass Onion' and '&lt;a href=\"Sexy%20Sadie\"&gt;Sexy Sadie&lt;/a&gt;'\". With regard to George Martin's contention that \"The Beatles\" should have been edited down to a single disc, however, he views \"Piggies\" as one of the White Album \"essentials\" contributed by Harrison, along with \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Savoy%20Truffle\"&gt;Savoy Truffle&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAmong reviewers of the 2009 remastered album, Sean Highkin of \"&lt;a href=\"Beats%20Per%20Minute%20%28website%29\"&gt;Beats Per Minute&lt;/a&gt;\" cites the track as evidence that, despite the disharmonious atmosphere within the group during 1968, \"All four Beatles were working at their highest levels\", with Harrison \"at his most acerbic on 'Piggies'\". Mark Richardson of \"&lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20%28website%29\"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;\" highlights the song as one of \"The Beatles\" \"iffy jokes\" that nevertheless succeed, due to the high standard of the band's songwriting and the effective sequencing of the double album. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Independent\"&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;\" listed \"Piggies\" at number 14 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He admired the harpsichord passage as a \"highlight\" of the album and wrote: \"On first listen, 'Piggies' is too strange to enjoy. Once its Orwellian nature is embraced, however, it becomes a joyous two fingers in the face of establishment told by Harrison in baroque pop form.\"\nOther versions.\n&lt;a href=\"Theo%20Bikel\"&gt;Theo Bikel&lt;/a&gt;, an actor, folk singer and &lt;a href=\"Activism\"&gt;activist&lt;/a&gt; who was a delegate at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, covered \"Piggies\" on his 1969 album \"A New Day\". Reviewing the opening night of Bikel's residency at the &lt;a href=\"Troubadour%20%28West%20Hollywood%2C%20California%29\"&gt;Troubadour&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles, in June 1970, \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine described the song as one of \"the more meaningful titles\" that the singer had adopted from the work of popular acts such as the Beatles, &lt;a href=\"the%20Rolling%20Stones\"&gt;the Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Donovan\"&gt;Donovan&lt;/a&gt;. The 1976 television adaptation of Vincent Bugliosi's book, also titled \"&lt;a href=\"Helter%20Skelter%20%281976%20film%29\"&gt;Helter Skelter&lt;/a&gt;\", features several Beatles songs, including \"Piggies\" and Harrison's White Album track \"Long, Long, Long\", both performed by the group Silverspoon. The song was also covered by &lt;a href=\"Danbert%20Nobacon\"&gt;Danbert Nobacon&lt;/a&gt;, lead singer of the &lt;a href=\"anarcho-punk\"&gt;anarcho-punk&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Chumbawamba\"&gt;Chumbawamba&lt;/a&gt;. Titled \"Piggies in Revolution 9\", Nobacon's version appeared on the 1989 album \"Fuck EMI\", a multi-artist compilation protesting EMI's business practices, particularly the company's involvement in &lt;a href=\"cruise%20missile\"&gt;cruise missile&lt;/a&gt; production.\nHaving become available on &lt;a href=\"Bootleg%20recording\"&gt;bootleg&lt;/a&gt; albums from 1991 onwards, Harrison's 1968 demo was released on the Beatles' \"&lt;a href=\"Anthology%203\"&gt;Anthology 3&lt;/a&gt;\" compilation in October 1996. Recorded on an &lt;a href=\"Ampex\"&gt;Ampex&lt;/a&gt; four-track recorder, the demo features Harrison playing two acoustic guitar parts, and a double-tracked lead vocal. Harrison performed \"Piggies\" throughout his &lt;a href=\"George%20Harrison%E2%80%93Eric%20Clapton%201991%20Japanese%20Tour\"&gt;1991 Japanese tour&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Clapton\"&gt;Eric Clapton&lt;/a&gt; and at his &lt;a href=\"Natural%20Law%20Party\"&gt;Natural Law Party&lt;/a&gt; concert in London in April 1992. With &lt;a href=\"synthesizer\"&gt;synthesizer&lt;/a&gt;s replicating the classical arrangement, a version recorded at the &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Dome\"&gt;Tokyo Dome&lt;/a&gt; on 15 December 1991 appears on Harrison's \"&lt;a href=\"Live%20in%20Japan%20%28George%20Harrison%20album%29\"&gt;Live in Japan&lt;/a&gt;\" double album.\n&lt;a href=\"Phish\"&gt;Phish&lt;/a&gt; included \"Piggies\" in their performance of \"The Beatles\" on Halloween 1994, which was released in 2002 as \"&lt;a href=\"Live%20Phish%20Volume%2013\"&gt;Live Phish Volume 13&lt;/a&gt;\". The harpsichord from the original Beatles recording was &lt;a href=\"mashup%20%28music%29\"&gt;mashed&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Jay-Z\"&gt;Jay-Z&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Change Clothes\" for a track on &lt;a href=\"Danger%20Mouse%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Danger Mouse&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Grey%20Album\"&gt;The Grey Album&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2004. For the Beatles' 2006 remix album \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20%28Beatles%20album%29\"&gt;Love&lt;/a&gt;\", compiled by Martin and his son &lt;a href=\"Giles%20Martin\"&gt;Giles&lt;/a&gt;, the harpsichord and cello parts were mixed into the ending of \"&lt;a href=\"Strawberry%20Fields%20Forever\"&gt;Strawberry Fields Forever&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe song was covered by &lt;a href=\"Pumajaw\"&gt;Pumajaw&lt;/a&gt; for \"The White Album Recovered\", a CD distributed with the September 2008 issue of \"&lt;a href=\"Mojo%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Mojo&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine. That same year, former &lt;a href=\"The%20Cars\"&gt;Cars&lt;/a&gt; keyboardist &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Hawkes\"&gt;Greg Hawkes&lt;/a&gt; issued a &lt;a href=\"ukulele\"&gt;ukulele&lt;/a&gt; rendition on his album \"The Beatles Uke\".\nPersonnel.\nAccording to Ian MacDonald, except where noted:\nThe Beatles\nAdditional musicians"
