The first album produced by the company, \"Dawn\" was released in September of that year. The album, \"Dawn\", was released with minimum promotion as Lai went to &lt;a href=\"Mainland%20China\"&gt;Mainland China&lt;/a&gt; for a movie shoot on the day of the album's release.\nIn 2005, Lai invited Taiwanese music producer &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Lee%20%28record%20producer%29\"&gt;Jonathan Lee&lt;/a&gt; to produce his new Mandarin album \"A Story\". However, by doing so he had to give up the opportunity for a lead role in a big budget &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; movie \"Gui Si\" due to conflicts in his schedules.\nHe returned to the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Coliseum\"&gt;Hong Kong Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; on 13 April 2007 to perform in his one night only \"Leon 4 in Love Concert,\" where he performed not only his own hits but also hits from the other three heavenly kings.

He subsequently released an album titled \"4 in Love\" on 3 May 2007, comprising 16 of the 18 songs he had performed at the concert.\nIn 2004, Paciwood co-invested with Esun Group to develop a music record company, East Asia Record Production Limited, with the music label &lt;a href=\"Amusic\"&gt;Amusic&lt;/a&gt;.\nActing career.\nAfter the New Talent Singing Awards, he had some opportunities to star in a few TV series. On one occasion, he went for the filming of a romantic serials titled, \"Fengyun Era\", in &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. There was a stark contrast in height between Lai and the popular lead actress who is only 160\u00a0cm tall. The actress then demanded that Lai squat while filming so as to make up for the height differences. Lai had to act through all the scenes with the actress while squatting, but he had to endure it as he was not popular at the time. Not long afterwards his new TVB series, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Breaking%20Point%20%281991%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Breaking Point&lt;/a&gt;\", turned out to be a resounding success and propelled him to widespread fame in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nIn 1996, Lai was nominated for the \"Best Actor\" award at the 16th &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Film%20Awards\"&gt;Hong Kong Film Awards&lt;/a&gt; for the film \"\".
