    "text": "Nothofagus gunnii, the tanglefoot- or deciduous beech, or Australian beech, is a &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt; shrub endemic to the highlands of &lt;a href=\"Tasmania\"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It was discovered in 1847 by R.C Gunn and evidence exists that it once lived in Antarctica. \"N. gunnii\" is a small woody tree with a shrubby appearance known to grow up to . It lives only on mountains due to temperature limitations within the Tasmanian maritime climate and only grow up since heights of . It grows in alpine and sub-alpine regions in the central portions of the state but is absent from the coast zones. Though capable of reaching the size of a small tree, it rarely exceeds in height, instead growing as a thick shrub or as a woody ground cover hence its common name of \"tanglefoot\".\nTaxonomy.\n&lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker\"&gt;Joseph Dalton Hooker&lt;/a&gt; described the tanglefoot beech.\nCommon names include tanglefoot- or deciduous beech, or fagus, which can also refer to the entire Beech family.\nThe species was renamed as \"Fuscospora gunnii\" by New Zealand scientists. The change in name is controversial, and it is not necessary to accept this change.\nDescription.\n\"Nothofagus gunnii\" is a small tree which may grow up to 4 metres tall (growth habit is heavily dependent on the exposure of the site) and has a thick shrubby appearance due to substantial branching. The alternating leaves are simple and ovate with toothed margins and attached by short petioles. Leaf lamina is generally &lt;20mm in length and is distinctly 'crinkled'. It is most easily visually separated from the other Tasmanian species from the same genus, \"&lt;a href=\"Nothofagus%20cunninghamii\"&gt;Nothofagus cunninghamii&lt;/a&gt;\", by the crinkled appearance of the leaf lamina. During Autumn and Winter months, the leaves undergo colour change as any other deciduous species does. The leaves of this deciduous species have an average lifespan of around 7-8 months. The &lt;a href=\"Leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are simple and alternate, growing 1\u00a0cm long. The leaf colour is bright green, turning yellow \n-then brilliant red, in autumn. They are almost circular in shape with deep veins which end in the gaps between the rounded teeth on the leaf. The plant has separate male and female &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s on the tree. Both male and female flowers are small and inconspicuous. The &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; is small (about 6\u00a0mm wide) and woody, and contains three small winged &lt;a href=\"nut%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;. In most years seed production is poor, but once in a while a 'mast' crop occurs with high germination. The seeds have a very short viability.\nTanglefoot forests cannot survive fire, and must re-establish from neighbouring areas. They are very sensitive to changed conditions due to their slow growth. Under of forest remain.\nThere are only two native deciduous tree in Tasmania, and there are only two cold climate winter-deciduous tree in Australia.\nDistribution.\n\"Nothofagus gunnii\" is endemic to the island of &lt;a href=\"Tasmania\"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, and is restricted to high altitude and relatively high rainfall areas with no recent fire activity. It was discovered at the summit of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus%20%28Tasmania%29\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; in central Tasmania, and is also known at several locations within the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Field%20National%20Park\"&gt;Mount Field National Park&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=\"Cradle%20Mountain\"&gt;Cradle Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. It is considered a paleoendemic species to Tasmania as macrofossils have been discovered within Oligocene sediments both in Tasmania and Antarctica.\nCultivation.\n\"Nothofagus gunnii\" required around 1,800\u00a0mm of rain spread throughout the year to be cultivated, cool temperatures not below -10\u00a0\u00b0C and also requires full sun. It grows in deep &lt;a href=\"peat\"&gt;peat&lt;/a&gt;y soils. It is best grown from fresh seed collected in a 'mast' year, germinating in a few weeks. It is believed that a beneficial &lt;a href=\"Ectomycorrhiza\"&gt;mycorrhyzal fungus&lt;/a&gt; is required for the long-term success of the plant. Cuttings can be struck, taken in late winter before bud burst.\n\"Nothofagus gunnii\" is rarely seen in cultivation due to its poor performance and slow growth. It is believed to be a candidate plant for &lt;a href=\"bonsai\"&gt;bonsai&lt;/a&gt;.\nEcology and reproduction.\n\"Nothofagus gunnii\" exists only in alpine and sub-alpine environments on mountains within Tasmania. The species is generally limited to heights above due to the temperature and relatively short snow lie duration within the Tasmanian oceanic climate. It may live as a dominant low shrubby tree on open, generally sloping, rocky ground. \"F. gunnii\" habitation is severely limited by fire regimes as it is extremely fire sensitive and will not survive burning. Local extinctions of the species have been attributed to fire in the &lt;a href=\"Denison%20Range\"&gt;Denison Range&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the limited range of \"Nothofagus gunnii\", the species is not listed as endangered.\nAlthough very few data are recorded about reproductive methods of \"F. gunnii\", it may be assumed that seeds are wind dispersed and that the species are mast seeders as is displayed in similar species such as \"Nothofagus cunninghamii\"."
