    "text": "The Bottom 14 Championship was a &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; knockout competition held by the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20League\"&gt;Rugby Football League&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1964%E2%80%9365%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20League%20season\"&gt;1964\u201365 season&lt;/a&gt;. The competition was used by RFL secretary &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Fallowfield\"&gt;Bill Fallowfield&lt;/a&gt; to trial an experimental rule change where the &lt;a href=\"play-the-ball\"&gt;play-the-ball&lt;/a&gt; was replaced with an alternative method of releasing the ball similar to &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt;. The tournament lasted only one season, and was won by &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Giants\"&gt;Huddersfield&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn February 1965, the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20League\"&gt;Rugby Football League&lt;/a&gt; (RFL) announced that a competition would be staged at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1964%E2%80%9365%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20League%20season\"&gt;1964\u201365 season&lt;/a&gt; for the bottom 14 clubs, and would be used to trial an alternative method of &lt;a href=\"play-the-ball\"&gt;playing the ball&lt;/a&gt;. The experiment was one of several attempts by the RFL to find a solution to discourage negative tactics being used by teams to keep possession of the ball.\nAlthough some clubs declined to take part, the competition went ahead as planned. The final was contested by &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Doncaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Giants\"&gt;Huddersfield&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tattersfield\"&gt;Tattersfield&lt;/a&gt;, with Huddersfield winning 13\u20133 in front of a crowd of 2,450.\nThe competition was not held again after the 1964\u201365 season, and the rule change was ultimately rejected at the RFL's annual general meeting."
