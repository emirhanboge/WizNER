    "text": "Stuart Ross Malcolm (born 20 August 1979) is a Scottish &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; coach and former player who is currently the manager of &lt;a href=\"Berwick%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Berwick Rangers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, Malcolm has previously played for &lt;a href=\"St%20Johnstone%20F.C.\"&gt;St Johnstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cowdenbeath%20F.C.\"&gt;Cowdenbeath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.\"&gt;Plymouth Argyle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ross%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Ross County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drogheda%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Drogheda United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Dublin City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alloa%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Alloa Athletic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Montrose%20F.C.\"&gt;Montrose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shelbourne%20F.C.\"&gt;Shelbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finn%20Harps%20F.C.\"&gt;Finn Harps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forfar%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Forfar Athletic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arbroath%20F.C.\"&gt;Arbroath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stenhousemuir%20F.C.\"&gt;Stenhousemuir&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalcolm was previously assistant manager to &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Kerr%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29\"&gt;Brian Kerr&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Albion%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Albion Rovers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Kilbride%20F.C.\"&gt;East Kilbride&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nSt Johnstone &amp; Plymouth.\nMalcolm's career started in 1998 when he signed a professional contract with &lt;a href=\"St%20Johnstone%20F.C.\"&gt;St Johnstone&lt;/a&gt;. He was sent on loan to struggling Third Division side &lt;a href=\"Cowdenbeath%20F.C.\"&gt;Cowdenbeath&lt;/a&gt; to gain experience, where he managed to stave off the possibility of finishing bottom of the Scottish league thanks to a win in the final game of the season against fellow strugglers &lt;a href=\"Montrose%20F.C.\"&gt;Montrose&lt;/a&gt;. When Malcolm finished his spell at St. Johnstone, he moved south of the border to &lt;a href=\"Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.\"&gt;Plymouth Argyle&lt;/a&gt;, where he played extensively in the reserves, although he was unable to make inroads in the first team.\nRoss County &amp; Ireland.\nAt the beginning of the 2003\u201304 season, Malcolm signed for &lt;a href=\"Ross%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Ross County&lt;/a&gt;, and he played the first game of his season for the team in the Scottish League Challenge Cup quarterfinal defeat to &lt;a href=\"Inverness%20Caledonian%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Inverness&lt;/a&gt;. Malcolm helped Ross County consolidate their position in the league during the 2003\u201304 season, though towards the end of the year he played much less frequently. This stemmed indirectly from a spate of yellow and red cards. He was first sent off for causing injury to &lt;a href=\"Laurie%20Ellis\"&gt;Laurie Ellis&lt;/a&gt;, and this was followed by a second for a challenge on &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Harty\"&gt;Ian Harty&lt;/a&gt;. Between February and May, Malcolm played just five games for the side. He was then dropped from the team after Christmas 2004.\nIn February 2005, Stuart departed Ross County to join &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Ireland%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;League of Ireland Premier Division&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Drogheda%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Drogheda United&lt;/a&gt;. Stuart became a regular in the team during the 2005 season and made an immediate impression for the &lt;a href=\"County%20Louth\"&gt;County Louth&lt;/a&gt; side. Despite a strong first season at Drogheda United, Stuart's one-year contract at the Drogs was not renewed and he became a free agent. It did not take Stuart long to find a new club as he signed for newly promoted Premier Division outfit &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Dublin City&lt;/a&gt; in January 2006. At his new club, he again became regular in the side and became an integral part of City's push up the table. Stuart's career at Dublin City was cut short as the club went out of existence in July 2006 due to financial difficulties.\nReturn to Scotland.\nHe then returned to Scottish football by signing for &lt;a href=\"Alloa%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Alloa Athletic&lt;/a&gt;, where he made his debut in a 6\u20131 drubbing at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Cowdenbeath%20F.C.\"&gt;Cowdenbeath&lt;/a&gt;. Later the same month, he picked up his first of three red cards in that term, two of which came in successive appearances. During March 2007, Malcolm left Alloa and signed for &lt;a href=\"Montrose%20F.C.\"&gt;Montrose&lt;/a&gt;, but he was released by Montrose at the end of the season.\nReturn to Ireland.\nImmediately after his release from Montrose, Malcolm returned to Irish football by agreeing to sign for Eircom League First Division outfit Shelbourne. The deal was brokered by Malcolm's former manager at Dublin City, Dermot Keely, who was then manager of Shels. Keely brought Malcolm to Tolka Park to help add much needed experience and bite to the Shelbourne side who were struggling in their first season in the FAI First Division after the &lt;a href=\"Tolka%20Park\"&gt;Tolka Park&lt;/a&gt; outfit's demotion to the second tier of Irish football. Stuart made his Shelbourne debut in a 1\u20130 victory against &lt;a href=\"Wexford%20Youths%20F.C.\"&gt;Wexford Youths&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tolka%20Park\"&gt;Tolka Park&lt;/a&gt; on 6 July 2007. He soon scored his first Shelbourne goal during a 5\u20132 victory over &lt;a href=\"Kilkenny%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Kilkenny City&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Buckley%20Park\"&gt;Buckley Park&lt;/a&gt;. After making 17 appearances for Shels, Malcolm departed in January 2008 to join &lt;a href=\"Finn%20Harps%20F.C.\"&gt;Finn Harps&lt;/a&gt;.\nForfar, Arbroath &amp; Stenhousemuir.\nIn the summer of 2009, Malcolm signed for &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Forfar%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Forfar Athletic&lt;/a&gt;. In the summer of 2010 he signed for &lt;a href=\"Arbroath%20F.C.\"&gt;Arbroath&lt;/a&gt; and was captain of the team during his three seasons with the club. He returned to Forfar in July 2013, and at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;2014\u201315 season&lt;/a&gt;, left Forfar and signed for &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20League%20One\"&gt;Scottish League One&lt;/a&gt; rivals &lt;a href=\"Stenhousemuir%20F.C.\"&gt;Stenhousemuir&lt;/a&gt;. After one season with the Warriors, Malcolm returned to &lt;a href=\"Station%20Park%2C%20Forfar\"&gt;Station Park&lt;/a&gt; in May 2016 for his third spell with the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20League%20Two\"&gt;Scottish League Two&lt;/a&gt; side.\nCoaching career.\nMalcolm was appointed assistant manager to &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Kerr%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29\"&gt;Brian Kerr&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20League%20One\"&gt;Scottish League One&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Albion%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Albion Rovers&lt;/a&gt; in May 2017. After the club were relegated to &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20League%20Two\"&gt;Scottish League Two&lt;/a&gt;, Kerr and Malcolm both resigned from their positions after just a year.\nMalcolm joined &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Kerr%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29\"&gt;Brian Kerr&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lowland%20Football%20League\"&gt;Lowland League&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"East%20Kilbride%20F.C.\"&gt;East Kilbride&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Lowland%20Football%20League\"&gt;2018-19&lt;/a&gt; season. Kerr left to be &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Caldwell\"&gt;Gary Caldwell's&lt;/a&gt; assistant at &lt;a href=\"Partick%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Partick Thistle&lt;/a&gt; in October 2018. Malcolm remained as caretaker manager and eventually was placed in charge until the end of the season. Malcolm would go on to lead &lt;a href=\"East%20Kilbride%20F.C.\"&gt;East Kilbride&lt;/a&gt; to their second &lt;a href=\"Lowland%20Football%20League\"&gt;Lowland League&lt;/a&gt; title in March 2019. \nMalcolm returned to former team &lt;a href=\"Forfar%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Forfar Athletic&lt;/a&gt; after being appointed the club's new manager in November 2019. Malcolm announced on his own Twitter page that he had resigned as Forfar Athletic manager on 9 April 2021, which the club reluctantly accepted.\nMalcolm was appointed manager of &lt;a href=\"Berwick%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Berwick Rangers&lt;/a&gt; on 31 May 2021."
