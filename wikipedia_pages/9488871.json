    "text": "Est\u00e1dio da Luz (, Stadium of Light), officially named Est\u00e1dio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica, was a &lt;a href=\"multi-purpose%20stadium\"&gt;multi-purpose stadium&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;, Portugal.\nIt was used mostly for &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches and hosted the home matches of &lt;a href=\"S.L.%20Benfica\"&gt;S.L. Benfica&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Portugal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Portugal national team&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium was opened on 1 December 1954 and it was able to hold an official maximum of 120,000 people, making it the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20European%20stadiums%20by%20capacity\"&gt;largest stadium in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20stadiums%20by%20capacity\"&gt;third largest in the world&lt;/a&gt; in terms of capacity. Some of the biggest attendances include a game against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;FC Porto&lt;/a&gt; with 135,000 people, the &lt;a href=\"1989%E2%80%9390%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1989\u201390 European Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-final against &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20de%20Marseille\"&gt;Olympique de Marseille&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"1991%20FIFA%20World%20Youth%20Championship\"&gt;1991 FIFA World Youth Championship&lt;/a&gt; final between &lt;a href=\"Portugal%20national%20under-20%20football%20team\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20under-20%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; with 127,000 people in each game. It also hosted the &lt;a href=\"1992%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1992 European Cup Winners' Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, the second leg of the &lt;a href=\"1983%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1983 UEFA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"1962%20Intercontinental%20Cup\"&gt;1962 Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts demolition started in 2002 so the new &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20da%20Luz\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio da Luz&lt;/a&gt; could be built near the same area.\nBackground.\nSince the club's formation, in 1904, &lt;a href=\"S.L.%20Benfica\"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt; had played mostly in rented fields, such as &lt;a href=\"Terras%20do%20Desembargador\"&gt;Terras do Desembargador&lt;/a&gt; (1905\u20131906), the &lt;a href=\"Campo%20da%20Feiteira\"&gt;Campo da Feiteira&lt;/a&gt; (1908\u20131911), the &lt;a href=\"Campo%20de%20Sete%20Rios\"&gt;Campo de Sete Rios&lt;/a&gt; (1913\u20131917), the &lt;a href=\"Campo%20de%20Benfica\"&gt;Campo de Benfica&lt;/a&gt; (1917\u20131922), and the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20do%20Campo%20Grande\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio do Campo Grande&lt;/a&gt;, built on land rented from historic rivals &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Sporting&lt;/a&gt; (1941\u20131954).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20das%20Amoreiras\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio das Amoreiras&lt;/a&gt;, a 20,000-capacity football stadium, belonged to the club, but was demolished to give way to a freeway (1925\u20131940).\nAfter a long process of negotiation with the municipality of Lisbon, it was finally established, on 17 May 1946, that the club would leave the rented stadium and move back to the Benfica neighbourhood. At the end of the meeting where this was established, the then Minister of Public Works is quoted as saying: \"Benfica is from Benfica and that's where it should return to\".\nThe construction years.\nAn adequate terrain, with good accessibility and enough room for future expansion was identified, in the north-east end of the &lt;a href=\"Benfica%20%28Lisbon%29\"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhood. Being located in the limit between the Benfica and the &lt;a href=\"Carnide\"&gt;Carnide&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhoods, though, the new stadium was at first known as \"Est\u00e1dio de Carnide\".\nIt was always the objective of the club to own both the stadium and the terrains, though at first a lease was made on the municipal terrains, with a final buy-out occurring only in 1969. The plans for the sports complex had been sketched as early as the late 1940s, by Jo\u00e3o Sim\u00f5es, a former player for the club.\nDriven by the club's president, &lt;a href=\"Joaquim%20Ferreira%20Bogalho\"&gt;Joaquim Ferreira Bogalho&lt;/a&gt;, the associates coped with an increased fee for supporting the building costs for the new stadium, offered large donations, and some went as far as to work themselves on the building yard on holidays or weekends. There was even a \"cement campaign\", whereby large quantities of cement bags were offered to the club.\nThe works officially started on 14 June 1953. Less than two years after, and at a cost of 12,037,683 escudos, on 1 December 1954 (a national holiday), the 40,000 capacity-crowd filled the stadium for the inaugural match against rivals &lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;FC Porto&lt;/a&gt;.\nImprovements.\nThe stadium at first had a capacity of 40,000, on two continuous tiers, but continued success of Benfica during the 1950s and, especially, the 1960s (the \"golden years\"), capacity increase was deemed inevitable.\nThe first stage of the famous third tier (\"Terceiro Anel\") was concluded in 1960, and increased capacity to 70,000. Flood-lighting had been introduced two years before.\nThe third tier was completed in 1985, setting the official capacity for the stadium at 120,000. Since there were no individual seats, this number was even surpassed on occasion. The 4 January 1987 championship match against Porto, had an estimated attendance of 135,000, and the final of the &lt;a href=\"1991%20FIFA%20World%20Youth%20Championship\"&gt;1991 FIFA World Youth Championship&lt;/a&gt;, between Portugal and Brazil, had an official attendance of 127,000.\nWhen the stadium was converted to &lt;a href=\"all-seater%20stadium\"&gt;all-seater&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, capacity was reduced to 78,000.\nThe end.\nAfter the difficult period experienced in the 1990s, both in results and in finances, the club had to ponder how to cope with the successful bid the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Portuguese Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; made to host the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt first, it was suggested the old stadium could undergo renovation work including the covering of all the stands with a self-supporting roof. Two projects, by architect &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A1s%20Taveira\"&gt;Tom\u00e1s Taveira&lt;/a&gt;, were presented to the associates in a short period of time, but both were abandoned. At one time it was suggested that the club withdraw its stadium from the list of host stadiums.\nFinally, on 28 September 2001, a general assembly of the associates voted for the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20da%20Luz\"&gt;new stadium&lt;/a&gt;. This was by no means an easy decision, since the historic \"Catedral\" would have to be demolished to give way to the new complex. The option, though, was deemed a necessity to ensure the financial feasibility of the project. The approved proposal stated: \"The Direction has decided to present to the associates the construction of a new stadium, fully conscious that this is the option that best responds to the earnings and needs of our Club, being both economically and financially sustainable, and will allow the associates of SL Benfica much better condition in which to follow the club's sporting events, in particular the football team's, and also revive our supporter base.\"\nThe team played at a partially demolished old stadium for a final season, with the then-reduced capacity-crowd of about 50,000 witnessing the last match of the old \"Luz\", on 22 March 2003. This was a round-26th championship match, against &lt;a href=\"C.D.%20Santa%20Clara\"&gt;Santa Clara&lt;/a&gt;, won by Benfica with a lone penalty conversion by &lt;a href=\"Sim%C3%A3o%20Sabrosa\"&gt;Sim\u00e3o Sabrosa&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnding the season with the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20Nacional\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio Nacional&lt;/a&gt; hosting Benfica's home matches, the club entered a new stage in its life, playing the first match in the \"Nova Catedral\" (the New Cathedral) on 25 October 2003. The new stadium would host the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004%20Final\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2004 Final&lt;/a&gt; match less than a year later.\nPortugal national football team.\nOddly, despite the stadium being opened in 1954, it did not receive any &lt;a href=\"Portugal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;national team&lt;/a&gt; matches until 1971, when Portugal played with &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.\nNames.\nAll the following names were used in reference to the old stadium, but now refer to the new one:\nThe former stadium is now commonly referred to as \"O Velho Est\u00e1dio\" (the Old Stadium) or \"A Velha Catedral\" (the Old Cathedral)."
