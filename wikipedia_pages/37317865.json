    "text": "The Justice Party () is a &lt;a href=\"Social%20liberalism\"&gt;left-liberal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Social%20democracy\"&gt;social democratic&lt;/a&gt; political party in &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded on 21 October 2012 when it split from the &lt;a href=\"Unified%20Progressive%20Party\"&gt;Unified Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Progressive Justice Party changed its name to the Justice Party at the 2nd party congress on 16 July 2013. At the 4th party congress on 22 November 2015, the party officially merged with the extra-parliamentary groups: Preparatory Committee for the People's Party (2015), Labor Politics Coalition(\ub178\ub3d9\uc815\uce58\uc5f0\ub300), Members of &lt;a href=\"Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, after motions to merge the party with the Justice Party failed.\nAfter the merger, &lt;a href=\"Na%20Gyung-che\"&gt;Na Gyung-che&lt;/a&gt;, Ex-leader of the &lt;a href=\"Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Se-kyun\"&gt;Kim Se-kyun&lt;/a&gt;, leader of Preparatory Committee for the People's Party, were elevated to co-leadership roles, while &lt;a href=\"Sim%20Sang-jung\"&gt;Sim Sang-jung&lt;/a&gt; remained as a standing party leader. &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Se-kyun\"&gt;Kim Se-kyun&lt;/a&gt; stepped down from the co-leadership role in September 2016.\nIn the legislative election held in April 2016, the party increased its seat total by one with the election of &lt;a href=\"Roh%20Hoe-chan\"&gt;Roh Hoe-chan&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Seongsan-gu\"&gt;Seongsan&lt;/a&gt; constituency in the city of &lt;a href=\"Changwon\"&gt;Changwon&lt;/a&gt;. The party polled 7.2% in the party list ballot, returning a total of six legislators to the National Assembly.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2017%20South%20Korean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; election, Sim Sang-jung ran as the party's nominee after winning the party primary. Sim was endorsed by &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Confederation%20of%20Trade%20Unions\"&gt;Korean Confederation of Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt; (KCTU) and ran a campaign focused on labor and social issues. Sim received media attention for being the only candidate arguing in favor of &lt;a href=\"marriage%20equality\"&gt;marriage equality&lt;/a&gt; during the debate. Sim won 6.2% of the vote, making her the most successful left-wing presidential candidate since the democratization of the country in 1987.\nIn July 2017, with Sim's two-year leadership term coming to an end, the party &lt;a href=\"2017%20Justice%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29%20leadership%20election\"&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt; sitting National Assembly member &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Jeong-mi\"&gt;Lee Jeong-mi&lt;/a&gt; as the new leader over &lt;a href=\"Park%20Won-suk\"&gt;Park Won-suk&lt;/a&gt; by 56 to 44.\nOn 31 March 2018, the party confirmed its decision to form a &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20group\"&gt;parliamentary group&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Party%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Peace\"&gt;Party for Democracy and Peace&lt;/a&gt;, under the name of &lt;a href=\"Members%20group%20of%20Peace%20and%20Justice\"&gt;Members group of Peace and Justice&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20group\"&gt;parliamentary group&lt;/a&gt; will be officially registered on 2 April. The incumbent floor leader of the party, &lt;a href=\"Roh%20Hoe-chan\"&gt;Roh Hoe-chan&lt;/a&gt; was chosen to head the parliamentary group in the National Assembly. &lt;a href=\"Roh%20Hoe-chan\"&gt;Roh Hoe-chan&lt;/a&gt;'s abrupt passing on 23 July 2018 resulted in the automatic dissolution of the parliamentary group. Roh's death was widely mourned, attracting thousands of mourners and tributes across the South Korean political spectrum. The party retained Roh's &lt;a href=\"Changwon\"&gt;Changwon&lt;/a&gt; seat, beating &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Korea%20Party\"&gt;Liberty Korea&lt;/a&gt; challenger in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20South%20Korean%20by-elections\"&gt;by-election&lt;/a&gt; held on 13 April 2019.\nIn July 2019, the party &lt;a href=\"2019%20Justice%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29%20leadership%20election\"&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sim%20Sang-jung\"&gt;Sim Sang-jung&lt;/a&gt; as the new leader. It is her second non-consecutive term as the party's leader.\nPolitical position.\nThe Justice Party officially advocates social democracy, but is also evaluated as \"liberal\" or \"social liberal\". South Korean traditional labor movement forces describe the Justice Party as a \"liberal\" party in a derogatory sense and do not recognize it as a \"social democratic\" party. JP claims to be a \"social democratic\" party that differentiates itself from DPK's \"liberal\", but the media describe JP as \"&lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Progressivism%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt;\". JP rejects social conservatism and takes a socially progressive stance on &lt;a href=\"Feminism%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;feminism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"LGBT%20rights%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;LGBT rights&lt;/a&gt; issues. Major JP politicians, including &lt;a href=\"Jang%20Hye-young\"&gt;Jang Hye-young&lt;/a&gt;, criticize the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Democratic Party of Korea&lt;/a&gt;, but have a fairly favorable view of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;U.S. Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; style &lt;a href=\"Modern%20liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;modern liberalism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Biden\"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;.\nJP proposes economically more &lt;a href=\"Political%20moderate\"&gt;moderate&lt;/a&gt; policies than &lt;a href=\"Social%20liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Left-wing%20populism\"&gt;left-wing populists&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;DPK&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Jae-myung\"&gt;Lee Jae-myung&lt;/a&gt;. Major JP politicians (at least officially) oppose populism to the extent that Shim even accused both &lt;a href=\"Yoon%20Suk-yeol\"&gt;Yoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Jae-myung\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; of being \"dangerous populism\" (). In 2021, major JP politician Kang Min-jin () said that &lt;a href=\"Sim%20Sang-jung\"&gt;Sim Sang-jung&lt;/a&gt;, JP's &lt;a href=\"2022%20South%20Korean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;presidential candidate in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, is not (left-wing populist and socialist) &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Sanders\"&gt;Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt;. JP values &lt;a href=\"Fiscal%20policy\"&gt;fiscal responsibility&lt;/a&gt; and advocates tax increases. Also, JP opposes &lt;a href=\"basic%20income\"&gt;basic income&lt;/a&gt;. However, they are active in the issue of &lt;a href=\"labor%20rights\"&gt;labor rights&lt;/a&gt; that liberal left-wing populists in the DPK are not interested in. Sim Sang-jung denied Lee Jae-myung and the DPK's possibility of solidarity the centre-left camp in the presidential candidate in 2022, and said they would stand in solidarity in partial matters with (&lt;a href=\"Centrism\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt; politicians) &lt;a href=\"Ahn%20Cheol-soo\"&gt;Ahn Cheol-soo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Dong-yeon\"&gt;Kim Dong-yeon&lt;/a&gt; to represent the voices of various citizens that (&lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;DPK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"People%20Power%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;PPP&lt;/a&gt;) both parties have not represented.\nIdeology.\nEconomy.\nThe party calls for &lt;a href=\"structural%20change\"&gt;structural change&lt;/a&gt; of the Korean economy through change to the current &lt;a href=\"Chaebol\"&gt;Chaebol&lt;/a&gt; dominated economic system, democratic control of the capitalistic excess through the implementation of &lt;a href=\"economic%20democracy\"&gt;economic democracy&lt;/a&gt; and public ownership of basic utilities. Pursuing an alternative form of economic system in which basic conditions for people's life is provided for everyone, equally. Where public or market economy is inefficient, the party will advocate a &lt;a href=\"social%20economy\"&gt;social economy&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt;s and further increasing the role of the social economy to the ones traditionally held by the market. It also calls for the protection of and the increasing of &lt;a href=\"labor%20rights\"&gt;labor rights&lt;/a&gt; and they promote &lt;a href=\"unionization\"&gt;unionization&lt;/a&gt; in the workplace, so to equalize the power balance between the capitalists and the workers. The party advocates for the creation of a &lt;a href=\"welfare%20state\"&gt;welfare state&lt;/a&gt;, drastically increasing funding in the public sector, providing universal welfare services like childcare, education, employment, housing, healthcare, and post-retirement life. The party will fund these programs through increased taxation based on the redistributive tax policy.\nEnvironment.\nThe party calls for an end to unrestricted development, pursuing &lt;a href=\"sustainable%20development\"&gt;sustainable development&lt;/a&gt;. It is also in favor of &lt;a href=\"animal%20welfare\"&gt;animal welfare&lt;/a&gt;. It argues in favor of developing &lt;a href=\"renewable%20energy\"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;, with sights on doing away with oil and coal altogether. The party is against &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20power\"&gt;nuclear energy&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative, and advocates closing down old nuclear power plants and ceasing further construction of the plants.\nSocial issues.\nThe party calls for the eradication of all forms of discrimination, advocating increased participation of the minorities in the political sphere. It further advocates pursuing &lt;a href=\"gender%20equality\"&gt;gender equality&lt;/a&gt; in the workplace and preserving women's &lt;a href=\"Pro-Choice\"&gt;right to choose to have an abortion&lt;/a&gt;. The party stands strongly against any form of oppression based on one's sexuality or gender identity. It calls for legislation relating to &lt;a href=\"hate%20crime\"&gt;hate crime&lt;/a&gt; to protect the human rights of minorities. It also acknowledges diverse family structures without any discrimination.\nForeign relations.\nIn the midst of the conflict between the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; for regional hegemony and Japanese attempts at rearmament, the party believes peace in the Korean peninsula is a paramount issue. The party rejects any form of hegemony from both sides and refuses to take a side on the issue.\nNorth Korea.\nThe Justice Party insists that the approach to North Korea should be approached with the values of universal human rights rather than an unconditional appeasement approach.\nOn 28 September 2020, Justice Party leader &lt;a href=\"Sim%20Sang-jung\"&gt;Sim Sang-jung&lt;/a&gt; expressed a critical view of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;'s conciliatory policy toward North Korea based on &lt;a href=\"Korean%20nationalism\"&gt;Korean nationalism&lt;/a&gt;, saying, \"Some of the ruling party prioritize &lt;a href=\"inter-Korean%20relations\"&gt;inter-Korean relations&lt;/a&gt; over the lives of our people, and this must be corrected.\" This critical view of North Korea, in particular, has deepened since 2020 due to conflicts with the ruling Democratic Party."
