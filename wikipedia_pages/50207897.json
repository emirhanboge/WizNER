    "text": "Anchinia porphyritica is a &lt;a href=\"moth\"&gt;moth&lt;/a&gt; in the family &lt;a href=\"Depressariidae\"&gt;Depressariidae&lt;/a&gt;. It was described by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Meyrick\"&gt;Edward Meyrick&lt;/a&gt; in 1914. It is found in &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt;, India.\nThe &lt;a href=\"wingspan\"&gt;wingspan&lt;/a&gt; is about 18\u00a0mm. The forewings are white, with a faint rosy tinge, irregularly sprinkled or mixed with pale ochreous and fuscous and with the basal half irregularly clouded with light ochreous and pale purplish. There is a fuscous spot on the costa at one-third, preceded and followed by whitish, and some irregular dark fuscous markings in the disc beneath it representing the anterior stigmata. There is a triangular dark purplish-fuscoua patch on the costa beyond the middle, its apex reaching a raised blackish spot representing the second discal stigma, and extended as a brownish streak to a small blackish spot on the dorsum before the tornus. There is some brownish suffusion along the costa posteriorly, and a small dark purplish-fuscous spot at four-fifths, as well as a terminal series of large blackish dots. The hindwings are light greyish ochreous."
