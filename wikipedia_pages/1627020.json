    "text": "Norman Eugene \"Clint\" Walker (May 30, 1927\u00a0\u2013 May 21, 2018) was an American actor and singer. He played cowboy &lt;a href=\"Cheyenne%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Cheyenne Bodie&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Western%20%28genre%29%23Film\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; series \"&lt;a href=\"Cheyenne%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Cheyenne&lt;/a&gt;\" from 1955 to 1963.\nEarly life.\nClint Walker was born Norman Eugene Walker in &lt;a href=\"Hartford%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Hartford, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, on May 30, 1927; the son of Gladys Huldah (\"n\u00e9e\" Schwanda) and Paul Arnold Walker. His mother was &lt;a href=\"Czechs\"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt;. He had a twin sister named Lucy (1927\u20132000).\nWalker left school to work at a factory and on a &lt;a href=\"riverboat\"&gt;riverboat&lt;/a&gt;, then joined the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Merchant%20Marine\"&gt;United States Merchant Marine&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 17 in the last months of World War II.\nAfter leaving the Merchant Marine, he worked doing odd jobs in &lt;a href=\"Brownwood%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Brownwood, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Long%20Beach%2C%20California\"&gt;Long Beach, California&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Las Vegas, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked as a &lt;a href=\"Doorman%20%28profession%29\"&gt;doorman&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sands%20Hotel%20and%20Casino\"&gt;Sands Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. Walker was also employed as a &lt;a href=\"sheet%20metal\"&gt;sheet metal&lt;/a&gt; worker and a &lt;a href=\"nightclub\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bouncer%20%28doorman%29\"&gt;bouncer&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nEarly films.\nWalker became a client of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Willson\"&gt;Henry Willson&lt;/a&gt;, who renamed him \"Jett Norman\" and cast him to appear in a &lt;a href=\"The%20Bowery%20Boys\"&gt;Bowery Boys&lt;/a&gt; film (\"&lt;a href=\"Jungle%20Gents\"&gt;Jungle Gents&lt;/a&gt;\") as a &lt;a href=\"Tarzan\"&gt;Tarzan&lt;/a&gt;-type character. In Los Angeles, he was hired by &lt;a href=\"Cecil%20B.%20DeMille\"&gt;Cecil B. DeMille&lt;/a&gt; to appear in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ten%20Commandments%20%281956%20film%29\"&gt;The Ten Commandments&lt;/a&gt;\".\nA friend in the film industry helped get him a few bit parts that brought him to the attention of &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt;, which was developing a &lt;a href=\"Western%20%28genre%29%23Film\"&gt;Western style&lt;/a&gt; television series.\n\"Cheyenne\".\nWalker's good looks and imposing physique (he stood 6\u00a0feet, 6\u00a0inches tall with a 48-inch chest and a 32-inch waist) helped him land an audition where he won the lead role in the TV series \"&lt;a href=\"Cheyenne%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Cheyenne&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBilled as \"Clint Walker\", he was cast as Cheyenne Bodie, a roaming cowboy hero in the post-&lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; era. His casting was announced in June 1955.\n\"Cheyenne\" originally appeared as part of \"&lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.%20Presents\"&gt;Warner Bros. Presents&lt;/a&gt;\" rotating with adaptations of \"&lt;a href=\"Kings%20Row%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Kings Row&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Casablanca%20%281955%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Casablanca&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Cheyenne\" turned out to be the breakout hit.\nWhile the series regularly capitalized on Walker's rugged frame with frequent bare-chested scenes, it was also well written and acted. It proved hugely popular for eight seasons. Walker's pleasant baritone singing voice was also occasionally utilized on the series and led Warner Brothers to produce an album of Walker doing traditional songs and ballads.\nEarly in the series run, Warners announced they would star Walker in a feature, \"The Story of Sam Houston\". It was not made.\nIn April 1956 Walker said \"I don't think I'd want any other roles ... Westerns keep me outdoors and active.\"\nWarners cast Walker in the lead of a Western feature film, \"&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dobbs\"&gt;Fort Dobbs&lt;/a&gt;\" (1958), directed by &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Douglas%20%28director%29\"&gt;Gordon Douglas&lt;/a&gt;. Howard Thompson described the actor as \"the biggest, finest-looking Western hero ever to sag a horse, with a pair of shoulders rivaling King Kong's\".\nBox office returns were modest. Warners tried him in another Douglas-directed Western, \"&lt;a href=\"Yellowstone%20Kelly\"&gt;Yellowstone Kelly&lt;/a&gt;\" (1959), co-starring &lt;a href=\"Edd%20Byrnes\"&gt;Edd Byrnes&lt;/a&gt; from another Warners TV show, \"&lt;a href=\"77%20Sunset%20Strip\"&gt;77 Sunset Strip&lt;/a&gt;\". It was a minor success.\nA number of \"Cheyenne\" episodes were cut into feature films and released theatrically in some markets and a brief clip of Walker galloping by on horseback as Bodie was featured in an &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Maverick%20episodes\"&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Maverick%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;\" starring &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Kelly%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Jack Kelly&lt;/a&gt;. He also guest starred on an episode of \"&lt;a href=\"77%20Sunset%20Strip\"&gt;77 Sunset Strip&lt;/a&gt;\". Warners tried Walker in a third Western feature directed by Douglas, \"&lt;a href=\"Gold%20of%20the%20Seven%20Saints\"&gt;Gold of the Seven Saints&lt;/a&gt;\" (1961), this time co-starring &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Moore\"&gt;Roger Moore&lt;/a&gt;, who was also under contract to Warners.\nPost-\"Cheyenne\".\nWalker had a role in \"&lt;a href=\"Kraft%20Suspense%20Theatre\"&gt;Kraft Suspense Theatre&lt;/a&gt;\" (episode \"Portrait of an Unknown Man\", alongside &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Duvall\"&gt;Robert Duvall&lt;/a&gt;). He had a supporting role in the &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Hudson\"&gt;Rock Hudson&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Doris%20Day\"&gt;Doris Day&lt;/a&gt; comedy, \"&lt;a href=\"Send%20Me%20No%20Flowers\"&gt;Send Me No Flowers&lt;/a&gt;\" (1964).\n&lt;a href=\"Frank%20Sinatra\"&gt;Frank Sinatra&lt;/a&gt; cast him in the leading role in the war drama \"&lt;a href=\"None%20but%20the%20Brave\"&gt;None but the Brave&lt;/a&gt;\" (1965), the only film Sinatra directed. After doing some guest appearances in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lucy%20Show\"&gt;The Lucy Show&lt;/a&gt;\" he fought a grizzly bear in Paramount's Western, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Night%20of%20the%20Grizzly\"&gt;The Night of the Grizzly&lt;/a&gt;\" (1966). He starred in a family adventure movie shot in India, \"&lt;a href=\"Maya%20%281966%20film%29\"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt;\" (1966).\nWalker had his biggest hit to date when he played the meek convict Samson Posey in the war drama \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dirty%20Dozen\"&gt;The Dirty Dozen&lt;/a&gt;\" (1967).\nWalker returned to Westerns with \"&lt;a href=\"More%20Dead%20Than%20Alive\"&gt;More Dead Than Alive&lt;/a&gt;\" (1969). The \"New York Times\" described the actor as \"a big, fine-looking chap and about as live-looking as any man could be. And there is something winning about his taciturn earnestness as an actor, although real emotion seldom breaks through\".\nWalker had support roles in two comic Westerns, \"&lt;a href=\"Sam%20Whiskey\"&gt;Sam Whiskey&lt;/a&gt;\" (1969) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Bank%20Robbery%20%281969%20film%29\"&gt;The Great Bank Robbery&lt;/a&gt;\" (1969).\n1970s.\nWalker was one of many names in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Phynx\"&gt;The Phynx&lt;/a&gt;\" (1970) and returned to TV with the leads in some TV movies, \"&lt;a href=\"Yuma%20%281971%20film%29\"&gt;Yuma&lt;/a&gt;\" (1971), \"&lt;a href=\"Hardcase%20%281972%20film%29\"&gt;Hardcase&lt;/a&gt;\" (1972), and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bounty%20Man\"&gt;The Bounty Man&lt;/a&gt;\" (1972).\nIn May 1971 he was seriously injured in a skiing accident on Mammoth Mountain when one of his ski poles went through his chest but he recovered.\nWalker supported &lt;a href=\"Telly%20Savalas\"&gt;Telly Savalas&lt;/a&gt; in the biopic \"&lt;a href=\"Pancho%20Villa%20%28film%29\"&gt;Pancho Villa&lt;/a&gt;\" (1972) and starred a short-lived series in 1974 called \"&lt;a href=\"Kodiak%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Kodiak&lt;/a&gt;\", playing an Alaskan patrolman. He starred in the &lt;a href=\"Television%20film\"&gt;made-for-television&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cult%20film\"&gt;cult film&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Killdozer%21%20%28film%29\"&gt;Killdozer!&lt;/a&gt;\" The same year as well as \"&lt;a href=\"Scream%20of%20the%20Wolf\"&gt;Scream of the Wolf&lt;/a&gt;\" (1974).\nWalker starred in \"Baker's Hawk\" (1976) and had support parts in \"&lt;a href=\"Snowbeast\"&gt;Snowbeast&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977), and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20White%20Buffalo\"&gt;The White Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977). He starred in the Canadian \"&lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Harvest%20%281977%20film%29\"&gt;Deadly Harvest&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977) and had a small role in \"&lt;a href=\"Centennial%20%28miniseries%29\"&gt;Centennial&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Mysterious Island of Beautiful Women\" (1979).\nLiterary pursuits.\nWalker met western author Kirby Jonas through &lt;a href=\"James%20Drury\"&gt;James Drury&lt;/a&gt;, a mutual friend. Jonas and Walker subsequently spent two years collaborating on a storyline by Walker involving gold and the &lt;a href=\"Yaqui\"&gt;Yaqui&lt;/a&gt;. The partnership led to the publication of the &lt;a href=\"2003%20in%20literature\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Western%20fiction\"&gt;Western novel&lt;/a&gt; \"Yaqui Gold\" ().\nHonors.\nWalker has a star on the &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hollywood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt; at 1505 &lt;a href=\"Vine%20Street\"&gt;Vine Street&lt;/a&gt;, near its intersection with &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Boulevard\"&gt;Sunset Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; (approximate coordinates: ).\nIn 2004, he was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Great%20Western%20Performers\"&gt;Hall of Great Western Performers&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Cowboy%20%26amp%3B%20Western%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20City%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe received the Golden Boot Award in 1997.\nIn 2017 he was presented an inlaid bronze star medallion on the Texas Trail of Fame in the Fort Worth Stockyards National Historic District. https://texastrailoffame.org/inductees/clint-walker/\nPersonal life and death.\nWalker had three marriages, each of which lasted approximately twenty years.
