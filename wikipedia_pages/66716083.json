    "text": "Khalil Ahmad Khalil, (&lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;:) is a Lebanese &lt;a href=\"intellectual\"&gt;intellectual&lt;/a&gt;, researcher, translator, prolific, and academic. He was born in 1942 in &lt;a href=\"Tyre%2C%20Lebanon\"&gt;Sur&lt;/a&gt;, South &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. He has many works in the fields of sociology in religion, politics, culture and philosophy, as well as a great number of translations, including &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Lalande%20%28philosopher%29\"&gt;Lalande&lt;/a&gt;'s Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the glossary of philosophical terms. He is considered one of the most prominent Arab intellectuals of the 20th century, and a leading member of the &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Progressive Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;. He joined the Party in 1968, and retired all organizational politics work after the assassination of Party leader &lt;a href=\"Kamal%20Jumblatt\"&gt;Kamal Jumblatt&lt;/a&gt;. He received a prize for his published works and translations, which enriched the Arabic library, as well as his academic achievement in the &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20University\"&gt;Lebanese University&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nKhalil Ahmad Khalil was born on the 12th of November 1942 in Sur. The death of two of his siblings had been a traumatizing event for his mother. In addition, he initially lived in this city, but later moved to live in a village with his grandmother Souda Al Shamiya, in &lt;a href=\"Gaana\"&gt;Gaana&lt;/a&gt;, South Lebanon. However, he mostly lived with his aunt Mila\u2019a.\nKhalil studied in the English School in Sur, one of the oldest missionary schools in the city. He then received Quranic education when he was in the care of his uncle Ash Sheikh Muhammed Ali As Saaya. He also studied grammar, learning eloquence and the richness of the &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic language&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, he studied in &lt;a href=\"Hanaouay\"&gt;Hanouiyeh&lt;/a&gt; School, where he learned French in the first and second grade of his elementary school. He returned to his parents\u2019 home in Sur when he turned ten years old and enrolled in the Jafaria School, where he received his official certificate. Khalil then lived some of his teenage years in a boarding school in &lt;a href=\"Bhamdoun\"&gt;Bahamdoun&lt;/a&gt; (the Arabic Institution), there he studied two grades of his senior year in one academic year. Before the end of the school year, he returned to Sur. Khalil was the only student that passed their baccalaureate examinations. Additionally, he studied philosophy in &lt;a href=\"Sidon\"&gt;Sidon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a child living in the villages of &lt;a href=\"Jabal%20Amel\"&gt;Jabal \u2018Amil&lt;/a&gt;, Khalil witnessed the &lt;a href=\"1948%20Palestinian%20exodus\"&gt;1948 Palestinian exodus&lt;/a&gt; and the suffering of &lt;a href=\"Palestinian%20refugees\"&gt;Palestinian refugees&lt;/a&gt;, as a result, he started his political and national work. The foundation of this, however, was built in Jafaria School that embraced many parties and political movements within it, examples: &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Ba%27ath%20Movement\"&gt;Arab Ba'ath movement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Social%20Nationalist%20Party%20in%20Lebanon\"&gt;Syrian Social Nationalist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arab%20nationalism\"&gt;Arab Nationalists&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communists&lt;/a&gt;. All of these parties were present in his school of Sur.\nFirst political speech.\nKhalil was 13 years old when he gave his first political speech, which he wrote in 1956 on the anniversary of &lt;a href=\"Balfour%20Declaration\"&gt;Balfour Declaration&lt;/a&gt; and after the &lt;a href=\"Algerian%20War\"&gt;Algerian Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. And that was after he asked his Jafaria School principal for permission to do so. As for the first political book he has ever read, it was &lt;a href=\"Jawaharlal%20Nehru\"&gt;Jawaharlal Nehru&lt;/a&gt;,\u2019s \"&lt;a href=\"Glimpses%20of%20World%20History\"&gt;Glimpses of World History&lt;/a&gt;\", he also read \"Al-Awd\u0101'a Al-Tashr\u012b'iyya Fi Al-Duwal Al-'Arabiyya\" by &lt;a href=\"Sobhi%20Mahmassani\"&gt;Sobhi Mahmassani&lt;/a&gt;.\nTime in France.\nKhalil traveled to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; to continue his higher education in 1962 and enrolled at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Lyon\"&gt;University of Lyon&lt;/a&gt;, college of arts and humanities, to earn his &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor\u2019s degree&lt;/a&gt; in 1966. Later, he registered his PhD thesis topic in &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20studies\"&gt;Islamologie&lt;/a&gt; supervised by the orientalist &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Arnaldez\"&gt;Roger Arnaldez&lt;/a&gt;. The topic of his thesis was \u201creligious education in Lebanon and its educational, social, and political role\u201d, and he received his PhD degree in 1968. He also received his second PhD degree in philosophy in 1984 from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Paris\"&gt;University of Paris&lt;/a&gt; under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Ch%C3%A2telet\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Ch\u00e2telet&lt;/a&gt;, and the topic of his thesis was \u201c&lt;a href=\"Kamal%20Jumblatt\"&gt;Kamal Jumblatt&lt;/a&gt;: the unitarian mind speech\u201d.\nIn France, Khalil discovered &lt;a href=\"Jean-Paul%20Sartre\"&gt;Sartre&lt;/a&gt;'s philosophy and was \u201cdeceived by it and by &lt;a href=\"existentialism\"&gt;existentialism&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d until he read &lt;a href=\"Jean-Paul%20Sartre\"&gt;Sartre&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s book \"&lt;a href=\"Reflections%20on%20the%20Jewish%20Question\"&gt;Reflections on the Jewish Question&lt;/a&gt;.\" The book acted as a declaration of support for Israel, which made Khalil feel betrayed. He wondered why Arabs translated his works and was surprised by &lt;a href=\"Jean-Paul%20Sartre\"&gt;Sartre&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s dualism, as he supported the &lt;a href=\"Algerian%20War\"&gt;Algerian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and had advocated for peoples\u2019 rights but apparently also supported the colonization of Palestine. He later discovered that the book was in fact a response to &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Marx\"&gt;Marx&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s book \"&lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Jewish%20Question\"&gt;On the Jewish Question&lt;/a&gt;\". Around that time, Khalil published his book Sartrism: The Paradox of Politics and Ethics (original: \"\u0100ls\u0101rtry\u0101 wth\u0101ft \u0101lsy\u0101s\u0101 wal\u0101\u1e96l\u0101q\").\nAfter this Parisian stage of his life, Khalil started doing research on &lt;a href=\"sociology\"&gt;sociology&lt;/a&gt;. He continued working on his &lt;a href=\"intellectual\"&gt;intellectual&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Culture\"&gt;cultural&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"social\"&gt;social&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Politics\"&gt;political&lt;/a&gt; books and translations, as well as his contributions to writing and cooperating with other Lebanese intellectuals to create a cultural magazine and periodical.\nKamal Jumblatt.\nAfter the student protest in France in 1968, Khalil realized that individual &lt;a href=\"political%20action\"&gt;political action&lt;/a&gt; \u201cis meaningless.\u201d Khalil adds, \u201cIf you want to work in &lt;a href=\"politics\"&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt;, you need to belong to a &lt;a href=\"Political%20party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt;. If there is no party, create your own.\u201d This stage was &lt;a href=\"Kamal%20Jumblatt\"&gt;Kamal Jumblatt&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s, one of the founders of the &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Progressive Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; in Lebanon. Khalil got to know &lt;a href=\"Kamal%20Jumblatt\"&gt;Jumblatt&lt;/a&gt; well, and they were brought together by discussions and debates that lasted for 6 months and eventually assembled the &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Progressive Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;. Khalil once described &lt;a href=\"Kamal%20Jumblatt\"&gt;Jumblatt&lt;/a&gt; as a \u201ca great mind that insisted on reaching other minds, his legacy is the proof of that persistence.\u201d When &lt;a href=\"Kamal%20Jumblatt\"&gt;Jumblatt&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"martyr\"&gt;martyr&lt;/a&gt;ed, Khalil retired organizational politics work, and devoted himself for academic work, writing, and translations.\nCultural and political activity.\nKhalil Ahmad Khalil originally started his cultural activity as a poet in 1963 under the guidance of Syrian-Lebanese poet &lt;a href=\"Adunis\"&gt;Adunis&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, &lt;a href=\"Adunis\"&gt;Adunis&lt;/a&gt; published his book \"Assawt Al Akhar\", a book on &lt;a href=\"modernism\"&gt;modernism&lt;/a&gt;, discussing Khalil\u2019s poetry collection \"Al Abwab\". In addition, &lt;a href=\"Adunis\"&gt;Adunis&lt;/a&gt; translated \u201cKhorooj\u201d, one of the poems in the collection. Khalil also published the following four poetic works: \"Yawm\u012by\u0101t Fall\u0101\u1e25 F\u012b Al-\u0120\u0101ba\u1e97 Al-H\u0331amr\u0101\u02bc, Mz\u0101myr Al-Twrh Al-Fak\u012brah, Byr \u0100l-Sl\u0101sl,\" and \"Nwr \u02bfl\u0101 \u01e6d\u0101r Al-Mwt.\" He also published many of his poems in magazines and newspapers. The last poem he published, \u201cRw\u0101ya Al-Rw\u0101ya\u201d was in \"Al-Adab Journal\" in the days of the late writer &lt;a href=\"Suhayl%20Idris\"&gt;Suhayl Idris&lt;/a&gt;. Khalil\u2019s poems are collected in two volumes.\nKhalil\u2019s popularity was not for his poetry, but for being a prominent &lt;a href=\"sociologists\"&gt;sociologists&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20world\"&gt;Arab world&lt;/a&gt;, and that is in all three fields of teaching, writing, and translation, particularly in &lt;a href=\"political%20sociology\"&gt;political sociology&lt;/a&gt;. In the \u201860s, he started his journey in writing poetry and literature, and gradually progressed to specialized studies. He also worked later on dictionaries, encyclopedias, and translations, the most famous of which being his translation of Lalande's Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which was published by Oueidat Editions &amp; Publications in 1991.\nIn 2006, after Khalil retired from the Institute of Social Sciences in the &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20University\"&gt;Lebanese University&lt;/a&gt;, he continued his journey in writing. He has over 140 works.\nKhalil made a number of studies on Lebanese &lt;a href=\"folk%20poetry\"&gt;folk poetry&lt;/a&gt;, and research on the &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Lebanese war&lt;/a&gt; and other topics such as religion and sociology. Moreover, perhaps his most popular works are his dictionaries in political, philosophical, religious, linguistic, mythological, psychosocial, economics and computer terms. He also published a dictionary of humanities in both Arabic and French, and another of social concepts in French, English, and Arabic, as well as an encyclopedia of Arab luminaries.\nKhalil\u2019s most notable achievement is his translation of &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Lalande%20%28philosopher%29\"&gt;Lalande&lt;/a&gt;'s Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Through that encyclopedia, he attempted to convey the European and global mind in Arabic. He spent four years working on the project. With the help of Ahmad Oueidat, Oueidat Editions &amp; Publications owner, who funded the project after taking out a mortgage on his apartment for 1 million Lebanese pounds, Khalil was able to complete his work.\nKhalil has an interest in physical theories as well, which is related to the way in which leading physicists interpret the universe. This was made clear in his latest writings, particularly in \"\u02bfql \u0100l-\u02bflm W\u02bfql \u0100l-Whm,\" and other articles, as well as \"\u1e24kmt Allah\", his translation of the book \"La Pens\u00e9e de Dieu\" by the &lt;a href=\"Igor%20and%20Grichka%20Bogdanoff\"&gt;Bogdanoff brothers&lt;/a&gt;, which has not been published yet. He also worked on a project titled \"\u0100lmwsw\u02bf\u0101 \u0100lqr\u0101ny\u0101\" between the years of 1956 and 2000, which is an encyclopedia that is yet to see the light.\nBetween the physical mind and the mythical mind.\nKhalil Ahmad Khalil says in an interview:\u201cThe physical mind sees things directly and tests them, where the mythical mind imagines things, and it is important to distinguish between the two. In my book, \"\u02bfql \u0100l-\u02bflm W\u02bfql \u0100l-Whm\" I added a map of out human body. The body consists of minds, and these minds are not just a brain, as the human body is made up of 100 trillion cells and each cell has its own mind and works on its own and with others. Cancer is but a defect in cell growth that creates an internal battle as it fails to perform its formative duty of cooperating. Cells are made to divide, hence Allah says in the Quran, \u201cThe mutual rivalry for piling up [the good things of this world] diverts you [from the more serious things], until you visit the graves,\u201d and it does not just refer to human reproduction, but to atom reproduction as well, as we are atoms, and planet Earth is an atom in the cosmic system that consists of 120 billion galaxies. \u201cWill you not then understand?\u201d My question here, why did westerners, specifically Europeans and American, contribute to Greek physics and Greek rationalism, but not Arabs, even though they have known about it for longer? Bearing in mind that physical science was mentioned in the Quran, that is without taking the direction Dr. Yusuf Marwa, author of \"\u0100l\u02bflwm \u0100l\u1e6dby\u02bfy\u0101 Fy \u0100lqr\u0101n \u0100lkrym\" had taken in his book. The Quran is a call to use the mind expertly, carefully, and critically, however, when ignorance prevails, fewer become the knowledgeable.\u201dKhalil ends the interview saying:\u201cin my estimation, after the year 2060, the Arab generation will start learning from painful historical experiences, after the forests burned down and the seeds grew in Arab and Islamic lands and a new day will come. All of this is connected to the burst of light of reason and knowledge in these burning lands. If that explosion never happens, Arabs will not rise.\u201d\nMajor works.\nKhalil has about 65 works in Arabic, and about 70 Arabicized books. In addition, it can be said that he has composed a set of foundational books, these include:"
