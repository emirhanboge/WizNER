    "text": "Stanley is an American &lt;a href=\"interactive\"&gt;interactive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"animated%20television%20series\"&gt;animated television series&lt;/a&gt; that aired on &lt;a href=\"Playhouse%20Disney\"&gt;Playhouse Disney&lt;/a&gt; based on the series of children's books \"Strange Relations\", which was written by \"Griff\" (as indicated on the cover of the original book), also known as Andrew Griffin. It was produced by &lt;a href=\"Cartoon%20Pizza\"&gt;Cartoon Pizza&lt;/a&gt; and was developed for television by &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Jinkins\"&gt;Jim Jinkins&lt;/a&gt; (the creator of \"&lt;a href=\"Doug%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Doug&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"PB%26amp%3BJ%20Otter\"&gt;PB&amp;J Otter&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Allegra%27s%20Window\"&gt;Allegra's Window&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"JoJo%27s%20Circus\"&gt;JoJo's Circus&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Pinky%20Dinky%20Doo\"&gt;Pinky Dinky Doo&lt;/a&gt;\") and &lt;a href=\"David%20Ray%20Campbell\"&gt;David Campbell&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Stanley\" teaches a wide variety of issues preschool children face, including change, growth, rules, and dealing with others. Each episode centers on an animal that deals with or helps explain the issue Stanley is grappling with.\nBahamian &lt;a href=\"Junkanoo\"&gt;Junkanoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"reggae%20fusion\"&gt;reggae fusion&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"Baha%20Men\"&gt;Baha Men&lt;/a&gt;, who are known for their hit song \"&lt;a href=\"Who%20Let%20the%20Dogs%20Out\"&gt;Who Let the Dogs Out&lt;/a&gt;\", sang the series' main theme song, \"My Man Stanley\".\nSynopsis.\nEach episode shows Stanley (voiced by Jessica D. Stone) in a situation he does not fully understand. He discusses it with his pet goldfish Dennis (&lt;a href=\"Charles%20Shaughnessy\"&gt;Charles Shaughnessy&lt;/a&gt;) before consulting either his computer or the \"Great Big Book of Everything\", a remarkably complete &lt;a href=\"zoology\"&gt;zoology&lt;/a&gt; book aimed at young children. By observing how an animal copes with the same situation Stanley faces, or how it can overcome a similar difficulty, Stanley learns to deal with the situation himself.\nThroughout the show Stanley and all his preschool aged friends are able to talk to his pet cat, Elsie (&lt;a href=\"Hynden%20Walch\"&gt;Hynden Walch&lt;/a&gt;) and dog Harry (Rene Mujica) as well as Dennis. Other animals also seem to occasionally respond, but never talk or give a definite indication they truly understood what was said. Stanley and his friends actively try to keep the adults (that is, except Stanley's grandmother), and by extension Stanley's older brother Lionel, from realizing this.\nThe \"Great Big Book of Everything\" is magical in nature, able to either let the animals out of the pages or allow the children to enter, sometimes changing them into animals in the process. This does not appear to be imaginary since occasionally adults do notice the noise, and Stanley works hard to hide the animals. There is also an episode where Stanley's brother sees a whale on the roof but dismisses the memory when it disappears back into the book.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Halloween\"&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt; special features Stanley's grandmother who, it is implied, is a witch. She reveals that she too can work the book, and in fact was the one who gave it to Stanley for a fourth birthday present. She was also the one who taught its theme song to Harry and Elsie.\nWhen someone says the \"Great Big Book of Everything\", hints it out, or even has the book, Elsie and Harry will wake up or find their way into the scene and start singing. This usually annoys Dennis, who after the introductory verse, says something like \"Oh, not again!\"\nEpisodes.\nSeason 1 (2001).\n1. \"Up the Apple Tree / Kangaroo Clean-Up\"\n2. \"Daddy Pride / Show-and-Tell Shark\"\n3. \"Bearly Awake / The Eagle Has Landed\"\n4. \"Watch Out for Lionels / Growing Pains\"\n5. \"Frog Legs / Whoo's Afraid of the Dark?\"\n6. \"Tiger Hunt / Monkey-Bar Business\"\n7. \"Camel Commotion / There's Snow Place Like Home\"\n8. \"A Whale of a Song / Sloth for a Day\"\n9. \"Busy Busy Octopus / Honest Ostrich\"\n10. \"Dolphin Talk / Whole Lotta Snakin' Goin' On\"\n11. \"Platypus Problems / Rabbit Habit\"\n12. \"Savanna-Speeders! / Tyrannosaurus Wrecks\"\n13. \"Hippo Helpers / Where's Stanley?\"\n14. \"Penguin Party / Leave it to Beavers\"\n15. \"The Joker / Baby Pictures\"\n16. \"You've Got Pigeon Mail / It's a Prairie Dog's Life\"\n17. \"Remembering with Elephants / Garbage Can Bandit\"\n18. \"Little Dog Lost\"\n19. \"Snow Monkey See, Snow Monkey Do / Sick Day Stanley\"\n20. \"The Big Spill / Peekaboo Parrot\"\n21. \"&lt;a href=\"Gorilla\"&gt;Gorilla&lt;/a&gt; Sleepover / Sea Lion Slip-Up\"\n22. \"Worms at Work / Caterpillar Countdown\"\n23. \"In a While, Crocodile / The Color of Stanley\"\n24. \"Searching for Spring / Save the Bluebird!\"\n25. \"The Pond Couple / Who's Afraid of Walter Wolf?\"\n26. \"A Little Squirrel Music / A Boy's Best Friend Is His Fish\"\nSeason 2 (2002\u201303).\n1. \"Ant Picnic / The Tooth About Teeth\"\n2. \"Eel-lectricity / Roller Rhino\"\n3. \"Keep 'Em Flying / Guess What's Coming to Dinner\"\n4. \"The Really Real Dragon / A Billy Goat for Dad\"\n5. \"Bloodhound Blues / Clock-a-Doodle-Doo!\"\n6. \"Mistaken Mermaid / It Pays to Be a Pelican\"\n7. \"Woodpecker Woes / P.U.

When Playhouse Disney rebranded its on-air presentation in 2007, \"Stanley\" was put on a new time slot at 6:00 AM ET on the weekdays. Stanley stopped airing in May 2008, but the show was still available on the Playhouse Disney website. In February 2011, the show was completely removed when Playhouse Disney rebranded as &lt;a href=\"Disney%20Junior\"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/a&gt;. The show was briefly seen online on DisneyJunior.com as part of \"fan favorites\" week on the week of June 20, 2011. From March 23, 2012 to September 3, 2013, the series returned on the U.S. airwaves on &lt;a href=\"Disney%20Junior\"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/a&gt;. And Stanley was kept on demand and on air at midnight from that point until 2019, when it was removed. The show has yet to be added to &lt;a href=\"Disney%2B\"&gt;Disney+&lt;/a&gt;; although, reruns are currently airing on the weekends on Disney Junior in Japan.\nIn Canada, it ran on The Family Channel from 2002 to 2007 and then was moved to Disney Junior, which ran from November 30, 2007 until September 29, 2013, when it was removed from the schedule. It also aired on the Canadian-French version of Disney Junior since 2010.\nStanley's Great Big Book of Adventure.\nStanley wanted to help Lionel finish his new &lt;a href=\"song\"&gt;song&lt;/a&gt;, so he gets help from a &lt;a href=\"K%C5%8Dkako\"&gt;Kokako bird&lt;/a&gt; from the Great Big Book of Everything to do so, but the bird takes the finished song back into the book, prompting Stanley and Dennis to get it back. They were only able to retrieve half of the &lt;a href=\"song\"&gt;song&lt;/a&gt;, prompting Lionel to take the book.\nWhile looking at the Great Big Book of Everything, Lionel sees a page about the &lt;a href=\"arctic\"&gt;arctic&lt;/a&gt; and (seeing the place as the perfect place to write a song without &lt;a href=\"noise\"&gt;noise&lt;/a&gt;, bothers, and &lt;a href=\"brothers\"&gt;brothers&lt;/a&gt;) wished he could live there, which caused the book to suck him there.\nStanley and Dennis tries to find Lionel in many &lt;a href=\"habitats\"&gt;habitats&lt;/a&gt; in the book, using the &lt;a href=\"adaptations\"&gt;adaptations&lt;/a&gt; of the native &lt;a href=\"animals\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt; to aid them. but several incidents with Harry and Elsie cause the trio to switch from habitat to habitat,\nWhen Mrs. Griff came to Stanley's room to check on him, Harry and Elsie try to hide the &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, but caused all the pages to fall out, not only resulting in Lionel and Stanley with Dennis swapping habitats again. Stanley convinced his mom that he's working things out with Lionel, and after she was glad to hear this she tells him dinner starts in half an hour, causing the others to speed up their search. Stanley, who is now on a &lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;, suddenly sees an &lt;a href=\"elephant\"&gt;elephant&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"penguin\"&gt;penguin&lt;/a&gt; in the exact same area. After learning this was because the pages fell out, Stanley and Dennis tried to come out of the book to fix this, only to find that they're stuck due to the same condition.\nSo, Stanley's friends are called to come over and race to put the Great Big Book of Everything back together, hoping to free Stanley, Dennis and Lionel, and saving all the animals, while Stanley and Dennis continue to look for Lionel.\nAwards and nominations.\n&lt;a href=\"Daytime%20Emmy%20Awards\"&gt;Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt;\nFilm.\nOn January 3, 2006, &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20Home%20Entertainment\"&gt;Walt Disney Home Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cartoon%20Pizza\"&gt;Cartoon Pizza&lt;/a&gt; released a full-length &lt;a href=\"direct-to-video\"&gt;direct-to-video&lt;/a&gt; movie based on \"Stanley\".
