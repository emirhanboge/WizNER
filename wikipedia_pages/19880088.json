He then signed for &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20Rugby\"&gt;Edinburgh Rugby&lt;/a&gt; where he mainly played as understudy to Scottish internationalists &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Blair\"&gt;Mike Blair&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Greig%20Laidlaw\"&gt;Greig Laidlaw&lt;/a&gt; as well as competing against Welsh cap &lt;a href=\"Richie%20Rees\"&gt;Richie Rees&lt;/a&gt; 2014 in the &lt;a href=\"Pro14\"&gt;Pro12&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis crowning moment came in the 2012 &lt;a href=\"Heineken%20Cup\"&gt;Heineken Cup&lt;/a&gt; quarter final game against Tolouse. Leck was summoned from the bench with Edinburgh trailing 14-7 at half time to help secure a famous 19-14 win, securing the club's first ever European cup semi-final appearance.\nHowever, shortly afterwards he suffered a shoulder injury that would ultimately keep him out of the team for the next year, an injury that required three operations.
