    "text": "Waterville, historically known as Coirean (), is a village in &lt;a href=\"County%20Kerry\"&gt;County Kerry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Iveragh%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iveragh Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. The town is sited on a narrow &lt;a href=\"isthmus\"&gt;isthmus&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Lough%20Currane\"&gt;Lough Currane&lt;/a&gt; on the east side of the town, and &lt;a href=\"Ballinskelligs\"&gt;Ballinskelligs&lt;/a&gt; Bay on the west, and the Currane River connecting the two.\nThe &lt;a href=\"N70%20road%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;N70&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Kerry\"&gt;Ring of Kerry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"roads%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;route&lt;/a&gt; passes through the town. As of the 2016 &lt;a href=\"Central%20Statistics%20Office%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;CSO&lt;/a&gt; census, Waterville had a population of 462.\nName.\nThe town's name in &lt;a href=\"Irish%20language\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt;, \"Coire\u00e1n\", means \"little cauldron\" or \"little whirlpool\", and refers to the shape of Ballinskelligs Bay on which the town sits. This name, however, has been transplanted onto the lake with the lake's Irish name being \"Loch Lu\u00edoch\" or \"Loch Luidheach\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Butler%20family\"&gt;Butler family&lt;/a&gt; built a house at the mouth of the River Currane in the latter part of the 18th century. They named their house and estate Waterville. The village that developed on the estate during the first half of the 19th century was also named Waterville.\nHistory.\nPre-history.\nEvidence of ancient settlement in the area include a megalithic tomb at &lt;a href=\"Eightercua\"&gt;Eightercua&lt;/a&gt;. This four-stone alignment (stone-row) is located 1.5\u00a0km south-south-east of the village.\nTelegraphy.\nThe first successful transatlantic cable was finally laid after a number of attempts in 1865 by the &lt;a href=\"Transatlantic%20telegraph%20cable\"&gt;Anglo American Telegraph Company&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Content%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Heart's Content in Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valentia%20Island\"&gt;Valentia Island&lt;/a&gt; near Waterville.\nWaterville's role in transatlantic communication came later when in the 1880s, the Mackay-Bennett &lt;a href=\"Commercial%20Cable%20Company\"&gt;Commercial Cable Company&lt;/a&gt; laid their first &lt;a href=\"Transatlantic%20telegraph%20cable\"&gt;Transatlantic telegraph cable&lt;/a&gt; from the nearby townland of Spunkane to Hazel Hill, near &lt;a href=\"Canso%2C%20Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Canso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;. The cable station brought much activity to Waterville and additional housing was built to accommodate the telegraph company personnel who settled in the area. Waterville served as the principal European hub for the Commercial Cable Company.\nTelegraph cables.\nOn 13 July 1866, \"&lt;a href=\"SS%20Great%20Eastern\"&gt;SS Great Eastern&lt;/a&gt;\" steamed westward from &lt;a href=\"Valentia%20Island\"&gt;Valentia Island&lt;/a&gt; laying telegraph cable behind her. The successful landing at &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Content%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Heart's Content&lt;/a&gt;, Newfoundland on 27 July, established the first telegraph link between Europe and North America.\nLater, additional cables were laid from &lt;a href=\"Valentia%20Island\"&gt;Valentia Island&lt;/a&gt; and new stations opened at &lt;a href=\"Ballinskelligs\"&gt;Ballinskelligs&lt;/a&gt; (1874) and Waterville (1884) making &lt;a href=\"County%20Kerry\"&gt;County Kerry&lt;/a&gt; a focal point for intercontinental communication. The &lt;a href=\"Commercial%20Cable%20Company\"&gt;Commercial Cable Company&lt;/a&gt; were able to lay cables from Waterville to &lt;a href=\"Canso%2C%20Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Canso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;, with onward connections. Connections from Waterville to &lt;a href=\"Weston-super-Mare\"&gt;Weston-super-Mare&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Le%20Havre\"&gt;Le Havre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; were soon established. During the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the communication system between &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; went down on 7 August 1922 when IRA irregulars seized Waterville.\nIn July 2000, the cable stations received an International Milestone Heritage Site Award from the &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20Electrical%20and%20Electronics%20Engineers\"&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; (Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers Inc USA) for their significance in the history of electrical science. The Kerry cable stations are recognised as &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Communications Sites&lt;/a&gt;.\nWaterville's cable station history is outlined in an exhibition in the Tech Amergin centre, and the remaining structures and locations feature in the Waterville Heritage Trail.\nCommunity.\n&lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Chaplin\"&gt;Charlie Chaplin&lt;/a&gt; and his family first visited the town in 1959. They then returned to holiday in the town every year for over ten years. The community continued the connection to Chaplin by obtaining permission from the Charlie Chaplin estate to hold the inaugural Charlie Chaplin Comedy Film Festival in the spirit of Charlie Chaplin. The first festival was held in August 2011.\nThe Tech Amergin adult education centre (named after &lt;a href=\"Amergin%20Gl%C3%BAingel\"&gt;Amergin Gl\u00faingel&lt;/a&gt;, a mythical explorer to the area) is used as a venue for events, shows and exhibitions, and vocational training.\nSport.\nWaterville Golf links has been voted the 5th best golf course in UK and Ireland. The newer Hogs Head Golf Club was named \"Best New International Course\" in 2018 by &lt;a href=\"Golf%20Magazine\"&gt;Golf Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Waterville%20GAA\"&gt;Waterville GAA&lt;/a&gt; is the local &lt;a href=\"Gaelic%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;Gaelic Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; club. The club's facilities have been rebuilt and include a gym and public running track."
