    "text": "Energy &amp; Environment (\"E&amp;E\") is an &lt;a href=\"academic%20journal\"&gt;academic journal&lt;/a&gt; \"covering the direct and indirect environmental impacts of energy acquisition, transport, production and use\". Under its &lt;a href=\"editor-in-chief\"&gt;editor-in-chief&lt;/a&gt; from 1998 to 2017, &lt;a href=\"Sonja%20Boehmer-Christiansen\"&gt;Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen&lt;/a&gt;, it was known for easygoing &lt;a href=\"peer-review\"&gt;peer-review&lt;/a&gt; and publishing &lt;a href=\"climate%20change%20denial\"&gt;climate change denial&lt;/a&gt; papers. &lt;a href=\"Yiu%20Fai%20Tsang\"&gt;Yiu Fai Tsang&lt;/a&gt; became its editor-in-chief in May 2017.\nAbstracting and indexing.\nThe journal is abstracted and indexed in the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Sciences%20Citation%20Index\"&gt;Social Sciences Citation Index&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scopus\"&gt;Scopus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"EBSCO%20Publishing\"&gt;EBSCO databases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Current%20Contents\"&gt;Current Contents&lt;/a&gt;/Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, and &lt;a href=\"Compendex\"&gt;Compendex&lt;/a&gt;. According to the \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20Citation%20Reports\"&gt;Journal Citation Reports&lt;/a&gt;\", the journal had a 2012 &lt;a href=\"impact%20factor\"&gt;impact factor&lt;/a&gt; of 0.319, ranking it 90th out of 93 journals in the category \"Environmental Studies\".\nObjective.\nThe journal's mission statement states that the publication's \"objective is to inform across professional and disciplinary boundaries and debate the social, economic, political and technological implications of &lt;a href=\"environmental%20law\"&gt;environmental controls&lt;/a&gt;, as well as interrogate the science claims made to justify environmental regulations of the &lt;a href=\"energy%20industry\"&gt;energy industries&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"transport\"&gt;transport&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nHistory.\n\"Energy &amp; Environment\" was first published in 1989; David Everest (&lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20the%20Environment%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Department of the Environment&lt;/a&gt;, United Kingdom) was its founding editor. Following his death in 1998, Boehmer-Christiansen became the journal's editor. She and several members of the journal's editorial advisory board had previously been associated with \"the Energy and Environment Groups\" at the &lt;a href=\"Science%20and%20Technology%20Policy%20Research\"&gt;Science and Technology Policy Unit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Sussex\"&gt;University of Sussex&lt;/a&gt;), with John Surrey. Its publisher, &lt;a href=\"Multi-science\"&gt;Multi-science&lt;/a&gt; ceased trading on 31 December 2015 and the journal was transferred to &lt;a href=\"SAGE%20publising\"&gt;SAGE&lt;/a&gt;. In May 2017, &lt;a href=\"Yiu%20Fai%20Tsang\"&gt;Yiu Fai Tsang&lt;/a&gt; became the journal's editor.\nClimate change denial and criticism.\nThe journal is regarded as \"a small journal that caters to climate change denialists\". It has played an important role in attacking climate science and scientists, for example &lt;a href=\"Michael%20E.%20Mann\"&gt;Michael E. Mann&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral scientists and social scientists such &lt;a href=\"Gavin%20Schmidt\"&gt;Gavin Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20A.%20Pielke%20Jr.\"&gt;Roger A. Pielke Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stephan%20Lewandowsky\"&gt;Stephan Lewandowsky&lt;/a&gt; and Michael Ashley have criticised that \"E&amp;E\" has low standards of peer review and little impact. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Keeling\"&gt;Ralph Keeling&lt;/a&gt; criticized a paper in the journal which claimed that CO2 levels were above 400 ppm in 1825, 1857 and 1942, writing in a letter to the editor, \"Is it really the intent of \"E&amp;E\" to provide a forum for laundering pseudo-science?\"\nA 2005 article in \"&lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Science%20%26amp%3B%20Technology\"&gt;Environmental Science &amp; Technology&lt;/a&gt;\" stated that the journal is \"obscure\" and that \"scientific claims made in \"Energy &amp; Environment\" have little credibility among scientists.\" Boehmer-Christiansen acknowledged that the journal's \"impact rating has remained too low for many ambitious young researchers to use it\", but blamed this on \"the negative attitudes of the &lt;a href=\"Intergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change\"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (IPCC)/&lt;a href=\"Climatic%20Research%20Unit\"&gt;Climatic Research Unit&lt;/a&gt; people.\" According to &lt;a href=\"Hans%20von%20Storch\"&gt;Hans von Storch&lt;/a&gt;, the journal \"tries to give people who do not have a platform a platform,\" which \"is then attractive for skeptic papers. They know they can come through and that interested people make sure the paper enters the political realm.\"\nWhen asked about the publication in the Spring of 2003 of a revised version of the paper at the center of the &lt;a href=\"Soon%20and%20Baliunas%20controversy\"&gt;Soon and Baliunas controversy&lt;/a&gt;, Boehmer-Christiansen said, \"I'm following my political agenda -- a bit, anyway. But isn't that the right of the editor?\"\nPart of the journal's official &lt;a href=\"mission%20statement\"&gt;mission statement&lt;/a&gt; reads: \"\"E&amp;E\" has consistently striven to publish many 'voices' and to challenge conventional wisdoms. Perhaps more so than other European energy journal, the editor has made \"E&amp;E\" a forum for more sceptical analyses of 'climate change' and the advocated solutions\".\nThe journal has also been accused of publishing papers that could not have passed any reasonable peer review process, such as one in 2011 that claimed that the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; was made of &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;."
