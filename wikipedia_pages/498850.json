    "text": "Broken beat (sometimes referred to as \"bruk\") is an &lt;a href=\"electronic%20music\"&gt;electronic music&lt;/a&gt; genre that can be characterized by &lt;a href=\"Syncopation\"&gt;syncopated rhythm&lt;/a&gt; typically in &lt;a href=\"Meter%20%28music%29\"&gt;4/4 meter&lt;/a&gt;, with staggered or punctuated snare beats and/or hand claps. It has heavily influenced music in the UK.\nArtists in this area mostly have a &lt;a href=\"drum%20and%20bass\"&gt;drum and bass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hip%20hop%20music\"&gt;hip hop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"techno\"&gt;techno&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"acid%20jazz\"&gt;acid jazz&lt;/a&gt; background. Broken beat also has its roots in 1970s &lt;a href=\"jazz%20fusion\"&gt;jazz fusion&lt;/a&gt; and has been influenced by artists such as &lt;a href=\"Lonnie%20Liston%20Smith\"&gt;Lonnie Liston Smith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mizell%20Brothers\"&gt;The Mizell Brothers&lt;/a&gt; (producers for &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Byrd\"&gt;Donald Byrd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bobbi%20Humphrey\"&gt;Bobbi Humphrey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20%26quot%3BHammond%26quot%3B%20Smith\"&gt;Johnny Hammond&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-1970s), &lt;a href=\"Herbie%20Hancock\"&gt;Herbie Hancock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Duke\"&gt;George Duke&lt;/a&gt;, and others. One might also hear echos of &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt;, 1980s &lt;a href=\"contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB\"&gt;contemporary R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"funk\"&gt;funk&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Shalamar\"&gt;Shalamar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt;), early &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kraftwerk\"&gt;Kraftwerk&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"hip%20hop%20music\"&gt;hip hop&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Planet%20Rock%20%28song%29\"&gt;Planet Rock&lt;/a&gt;\"), 1980s &lt;a href=\"New%20wave%20music\"&gt;new wave&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Depeche%20Mode\"&gt;Depeche Mode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Order%20%28band%29\"&gt;New Order&lt;/a&gt;), house and techno in broken beat.\nHistory.\nBroken beat first appeared in the 1990s and was pioneered by &lt;a href=\"Bugz%20in%20the%20Attic\"&gt;Bugz in the Attic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"IG%20Culture\"&gt;IG Culture&lt;/a&gt;, and the release of the &lt;a href=\"4hero\"&gt;4hero&lt;/a&gt; album, \"&lt;a href=\"Two%20Pages\"&gt;Two Pages&lt;/a&gt;,\" was influential on the emerging sound and scene. John Bush from All Music called it \"about as fusion-soaked as it gets.\" Appearing in the western parts of &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, the genre is also referred to as \"West London\", mainly because Goya Music's offices were in London's &lt;a href=\"Ladbroke%20Grove\"&gt;Ladbroke Grove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"W%20postcode%20area\"&gt;W11&lt;/a&gt;, as were most of the participating artists' studios.\n&lt;a href=\"Bugz%20in%20the%20Attic\"&gt;Bugz in the Attic&lt;/a&gt;'s Neon phusion, &lt;a href=\"Afronaught\"&gt;Afronaught&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"IG%20Culture\"&gt;IG Culture&lt;/a&gt; are credited with kick-starting the scene with numerous releases under various monikers, and the New Sector Movements releases for People Music. The sound created combined a variety of music styles including funk, soul, and hip-hop. The transition was to a more abstract form of drum and bass. Many artists that started releasing through &lt;a href=\"4hero\"&gt;4hero&lt;/a&gt;'s Reinforced label are now considered pioneers of broken beat. Simultaneously, established &lt;a href=\"techno\"&gt;techno&lt;/a&gt; artists like &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Craig\"&gt;Carl Craig&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stacey%20Pullen\"&gt;Stacey Pullen&lt;/a&gt; experimented with the music they were making, trying to add &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; elements and breaks to their sound. As the music is still based on classic Detroit techno and usually has a harder sound, it is sometimes referred to as \"broken techno\". This eclectic mixture was picked up by the Detroit and jazz affiliated UK techno producers &lt;a href=\"Kirk%20Degiorgio\"&gt;Kirk Degiorgio&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kirk%20Degiorgio\"&gt;As One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ian%20O%27Brien\"&gt;Ian O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;, who tried to form it into a more soulful variation which further influenced the development of the broken beat genre.\nScene.\nRegular nights that play this genre of music include &lt;a href=\"Co-op%20%28club%20night%29\"&gt;Co-op&lt;/a&gt;, the brainchild of &lt;a href=\"Bugz%20in%20the%20Attic\"&gt;Bugz in the Attic&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Force\"&gt;Mark Force&lt;/a&gt;, held at &lt;a href=\"Velvet%20Room\"&gt;Velvet Room&lt;/a&gt;, and then a few years later moving on to &lt;a href=\"Plastic%20People%20club\"&gt;Plastic People&lt;/a&gt;, a famous club located in London, for a number of years before re-launching at East Village - both in Shoreditch. In 2008 &lt;a href=\"Afronaut\"&gt;Afronaut&lt;/a&gt; and Bruce Q (Liquid Fusion) teamed up for a monthly Co-Op sessions which was launched at Concrete in Birmingham, UK. Liquid Fusion ran every Sunday at The living Room (2000-2002) first then onto Zinc (2002-2008). It had a following of several Hundred weekly. Another night is Inspiration Information, previously at &lt;a href=\"Notting%20Hill%20Arts%20Club\"&gt;Notting Hill Arts Club&lt;/a&gt; but now at East Village in Shoreditch."
