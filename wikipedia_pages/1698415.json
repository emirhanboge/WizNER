    "title": "Credit (creative arts)",
    "text": "In general, the term credit in the artistic or intellectual sense refers to an acknowledgment of those who contributed to a work, whether through ideas or in a more direct sense.\nCredit in the arts.\nIn the creative &lt;a href=\"arts\"&gt;arts&lt;/a&gt;, credits are an acknowledgment of those who participated in the production. They are often shown at the end of movies and on CD jackets. In &lt;a href=\"film\"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"video\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"television\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"theater\"&gt;theater&lt;/a&gt;, etc., \"credits\" means the list of &lt;a href=\"actor\"&gt;actor&lt;/a&gt;s and behind-the-scenes staff who contributed to the production.\nNon-fiction.\nIn &lt;a href=\"non-fiction\"&gt;non-fiction&lt;/a&gt; writing, especially academic works, it is generally considered important to give credit to sources of information and ideas. Failure to do so often gives rise to charges of &lt;a href=\"plagiarism\"&gt;plagiarism&lt;/a&gt;, and \"piracy\" of &lt;a href=\"intellectual%20rights\"&gt;intellectual rights&lt;/a&gt; such as the right to receive a &lt;a href=\"copyright\"&gt;royalty&lt;/a&gt; for having written. In this sense the financial and &lt;a href=\"individual%20capital\"&gt;individual&lt;/a&gt; meanings are linked.\nAcademic papers generally contain a lengthy section of footnotes or &lt;a href=\"scientific%20citation\"&gt;citations&lt;/a&gt;. Such detailed crediting of sources provides readers with an opportunity to discover more about the cited material. It also provides a check against misquotation, as it's easy for an attributed quote to be checked when the reference is available. All of this is thought to improve &lt;a href=\"integrity\"&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"instructional%20capital\"&gt;instructional capital&lt;/a&gt; conveyed, which may be quite fragile, and easy to misinterpret or to misapply.\nIn fiction.\nIn &lt;a href=\"fiction\"&gt;fiction&lt;/a&gt; writing, authors are generally expected to give credit to those who contributed significantly to a work. Sometimes authors who do not want credit for their work directly may choose to use a &lt;a href=\"pen%20name\"&gt;pen name&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"ghostwriter\"&gt;ghostwriter&lt;/a&gt; gives all or some of the credit for his or her writing to someone else.\nIn computing.\nIn &lt;a href=\"computer%20software\"&gt;computer software&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"software%20license\"&gt;licenses&lt;/a&gt;, attribution of credit is sometimes a condition of licensing. For example, original versions of the &lt;a href=\"BSD%20license\"&gt;BSD license&lt;/a&gt; controversially required credit to be provided in the advertisement for software that used licensed code, but only if features or use of the licensed software was mentioned in the advertisement.\n&lt;a href=\"Software%20documentation\"&gt;Software documentation&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes licensed under similar terms. For example, the &lt;a href=\"GNU%20Free%20Documentation%20License\"&gt;GNU Free Documentation License&lt;/a&gt; (GFDL) used by &lt;a href=\"Wikipedia\"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; requires that acknowledgments to authors be preserved."
