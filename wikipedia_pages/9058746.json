    "text": "Tarmac Group Limited was a British building materials company headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton\"&gt;Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. It produced &lt;a href=\"road%20surface\"&gt;road surfacing&lt;/a&gt; and heavy &lt;a href=\"building%20material\"&gt;building material&lt;/a&gt;s including &lt;a href=\"Construction%20aggregate\"&gt;aggregates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cement\"&gt;cement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lime%20%28material%29\"&gt;lime&lt;/a&gt;, as well as operating as a &lt;a href=\"road%20construction\"&gt;road construction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"road%23Maintenance\"&gt;maintenance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"subcontractor\"&gt;subcontractor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe company was founded in 1903 by &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Purnell%20Hooley\"&gt;Edgar Purnell Hooley&lt;/a&gt; after he patented the road surfacing material &lt;a href=\"Tarmacadam\"&gt;tarmac&lt;/a&gt; in 1901. The company was formerly listed on the &lt;a href=\"London%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and was once a constituent of the &lt;a href=\"FTSE%20100%20Index\"&gt;FTSE 100 Index&lt;/a&gt;. In July 1999, Tarmac demerged its construction and professional services businesses under the name &lt;a href=\"Carillion\"&gt;Carillion&lt;/a&gt;; the Tarmac building materials business was acquired by &lt;a href=\"Anglo%20American%20plc\"&gt;Anglo American&lt;/a&gt; later that year.\nIn 2010, the group was separated into Tarmac Limited and &lt;a href=\"Tarmac%20Building%20Products\"&gt;Tarmac Building Products&lt;/a&gt;. Anglo American merged Tarmac Limited with the United Kingdom assets of &lt;a href=\"Lafarge%20%28company%29\"&gt;Lafarge&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 to form a 50:50 joint venture, &lt;a href=\"Lafarge%20Tarmac\"&gt;Lafarge Tarmac&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Tarmac%20Holdings\"&gt;Tarmac Holdings&lt;/a&gt;). Tarmac Building Products was subsequently sold to Lafarge Tarmac in 2014.\nHistory.\nGrowth of a roadstone business.\nThe company was originally formed by &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Purnell%20Hooley\"&gt;Edgar Purnell Hooley&lt;/a&gt; as the Tar Macadam (Purnell Hooley's Patent) Syndicate Limited in 1903. The distinguishing feature of the new process was that it \"tarred\" cheap blast furnace &lt;a href=\"slag\"&gt;slag&lt;/a&gt;, a steelworks by-product, rather than expensive roadstone and the company entered into long term contracts with steelworks to ensure its supply.\nThe business was secured in 1905 by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Alfred%20Hickman%2C%201st%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir Alfred Hickman&lt;/a&gt;, who became its first &lt;a href=\"chairman\"&gt;chairman&lt;/a&gt;. The company remained under the effective control of members of the Hickman and Martin family until 1979. There were Hickmans as chairmen until 1959; more significantly, Cecil Martin, the son in law of Victor Hickman, was appointed a director in 1923 and managing director two years later. Cecil's son Robin followed him in turn, serving first as managing director and then chairman and chief executive from 1971 to 1979.\nTarmac was first listed on the Birmingham Stock Exchange in 1913 and then the &lt;a href=\"London%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; in 1922. During the 1920s and \u201830s Tarmac had to cope with national strikes, recession and periods of intense competition. Nevertheless, the company gradually expanded its geographic coverage (particularly in the south east), increased its production of paving slabs and moved into road surfacing as well as supply.\nAs with so many companies in the construction industry, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; increased the demand for Tarmac\u2019s services, notably for surfacing the large numbers of airfields being built or modernised. By the time of its half centenary in 1953, Tarmac was processing over two million tons of slag a year, its road surfacing had developed into a significant civil engineering business, and its Vinculum subsidiary \"had become one of the major precast concrete undertakings in the country.\"\nUnder Robin Martin's leadership, Tarmac moved from being an important regional force to a national roadstone and contracting business. Acquisitions played a major role in Tarmac's growth. While leading the roadstone division, Martin had been responsible in 1959 for the acquisition of local competitor Tarslag and Crow Catchpole, which gave it a greater presence in the south east. In 1964, now group managing director, Martin acquired key quarrying assets, including Cliffe Hill Granite, Rowley Regis Granite and Hillhead Hughes.\nIn 1968, Martin engineered the three way merger between Tarmac, Derbyshire Stone and the Scottish Asphalt company, William Briggs, creating the country's \"largest roadstone and construction group\". The group was briefly known as Tarmac Derby but the Derby name was later dropped.\nTarmac becomes a housebuilder and contractor.\nFurther acquisitions were to come. Permanite, Britain's biggest roofing felt manufacturer, and &lt;a href=\"Limmer%20Holdings\"&gt;Limmer&lt;/a&gt;, a quoted asphalt company, were bought in 1971, while the 1973 purchase of &lt;a href=\"Mitchell%20Construction\"&gt;Mitchell Construction&lt;/a&gt; (which had foundered on the &lt;a href=\"Kariba%20Dam\"&gt;Kariba Dam&lt;/a&gt;) strengthened the construction division. However, the acquisition which was to radically change the direction of Tarmac was &lt;a href=\"McLean%20Homes\"&gt;McLean Homes&lt;/a&gt; bought at the beginning of 1974.\nMcLean was run by Eric Pountain, a one time estate agent who had sold his own housebuilding business to McLean, later taking over as managing director in a boardroom coup. McLean had been bought to strengthen Tarmac's own poorly performing housebuilding division and the enlarged operation, now run by Pountain, was producing around 2,000 houses a year.\nPountain had ambitions to become a national housebuilder, and by the end of the 1970s, McLean was building 4,000 houses a year and a substantial contributor to group profits. However, there were problems elsewhere in the group. In 1976, Tarmac had bought the old established contracting firm of &lt;a href=\"Holland%2C%20Hannen%20%26amp%3B%20Cubitts\"&gt;Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts&lt;/a&gt;; this was followed by contract provisions of \u00a316m in its &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;n subsidiary.\nThe head of the contracting division was dismissed and the finance director resigned. The boardroom pressure on Martin increased, and in 1979, he was forced out to be replaced by Eric Pountain as the new group managing director. Whereas Martin had created a national roadstone group, Pountain was to create the country's largest housebuilder.\nBy the end of the 1980s, British housebuilding was accounting for half of group profits but it was not the only activity to have been expanded. An alternative profits centre had been built up in the United States, starting in 1984, with the staged acquisition of Lone Star Industries; by the end of the decade Tarmac was operating across seven states in the United States. Construction in the United Kingdom had also grown and Tarmac was involved in such prestige projects as the &lt;a href=\"Thames%20Barrier\"&gt;Thames Barrier&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Channel%20Tunnel\"&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;.\n1990 to 1999: expansion then return to heavy building materials roots.\nHowever, the expansionary nature of the group did not leave it well placed to face the recession of the early 1990s. In particular, the housing division continued to invest heavily in land even though the market had peaked, leading to provisions of \u00a3132m in that division alone. Like his predecessor before him, Pountain was forced to step down as chief executive to be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Neville%20Simms\"&gt;Neville Simms&lt;/a&gt;, previously in charge of construction. Inevitably, the emphasis moved away from housing in favour of construction.\nIn October 1992, Tarmac acquired the privatised government agency &lt;a href=\"Property%20Services%20Agency\"&gt;PSA&lt;/a&gt; Projects to complement Tarmac Construction. This was initially called TBV Consult (reflecting a short lived partnership between Tarmac and &lt;a href=\"Black%20%26amp%3B%20Veatch\"&gt;Black &amp; Veatch&lt;/a&gt;) and was renamed TPS in 1998. Tarmac Professional Services also included a scientific and materials testing consultancy (Stanger), a facilities management company, specialist architects firms, and IT businesses.\nHousebuilding was progressively reduced in size until 1995, when Tarmac announced that the division would be sold. Later that year, Tarmac and &lt;a href=\"George%20Wimpey\"&gt;Wimpey&lt;/a&gt; announced an asset swap whereby Wimpey acquired all of Tarmac's housing, and in return, Tarmac received Wimpey's construction and minerals divisions. The downsizing continued, and in July 1999, Tarmac demerged its construction and professional services businesses under the name &lt;a href=\"Carillion\"&gt;Carillion&lt;/a&gt;.\n2000 to 2014.\nMonths later, Tarmac, now back to its roots as a roadstone and road surfacing business, accepted a bid from &lt;a href=\"Anglo%20American%20plc\"&gt;Anglo American Mining&lt;/a&gt;. In August 2007, Anglo American announced it was to sell the business but in February 2008, it went on to report that it was putting the sale on hold. In June 2008, Tarmac Iberia was sold to &lt;a href=\"Holcim\"&gt;Holcim&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn February 2010, Anglo American sold Tarmac's European concrete aggregates business to &lt;a href=\"Eurovia\"&gt;Eurovia&lt;/a&gt;; it also sold its Polish concrete products business to the private equity firm Innova Capital. A few months later, the French concrete products business was sold to the private equity firm Foundations Capital. In February 2011, Anglo-American announced a proposed joint venture with &lt;a href=\"Lafarge%20%28company%29\"&gt;Lafarge&lt;/a&gt; that involved combining both companies' aggregates businesses in the United Kingdom. The merger, which excluded Tarmac Building Products, was completed in March 2013, following receipt of necessary approvals from the UK &lt;a href=\"Competition%20Commission\"&gt;Competition Commission&lt;/a&gt;, forming &lt;a href=\"Tarmac%20%28company%29\"&gt;Lafarge Tarmac&lt;/a&gt;. Tarmac Building Products, the last part of the business still wholly owned by Anglo-American, was acquired by Lafarge Tarmac in April 2014.\nOperations.\nTarmac Group consisted of Tarmac Building Products, Tarmac Middle East and 50% of Lafarge Tarmac.\nTarmac Building Products.\nTarmac Building Products was the largest supplier in the United Kingdom of heavy building products. It supplied aircrete blocks, aggregate blocks, bagged aggregates, mortar, screeds, sports surfaces, TermoDeck, foundry sands, grouts, plasters, renders, bagged cement and bagged lime. It also offers bespoke production and contract manufacturing.\nTarmac Middle East.\nTarmac Middle East was one of the largest and leading suppliers of aggregates and asphalt to the Middle East construction industry. It had interests in Primary Aggregate &amp; Road Base Materials, Armour stone, Wet mix and Asphalt Products and Asphalt &amp; Road Base contracting services.\nLafarge Tarmac.\nLafarge Tarmac was a 50:50 joint venture between &lt;a href=\"Lafarge%20%28company%29\"&gt;Lafarge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anglo%20American%20plc\"&gt;Anglo American&lt;/a&gt;. It was the leading construction materials company in the United Kingdom, comprising cement, aggregates, ready mixed concrete, asphalt and contracting businesses in the United Kingdom.\nMajor projects by Tarmac Construction.\nProjects undertaken by or involving &lt;a href=\"Carillion\"&gt;Tarmac Construction&lt;/a&gt; prior to demerger of that business in 1999 included the &lt;a href=\"M6%20motorway\"&gt;Preston Bypass&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1958, the &lt;a href=\"M10%20motorway%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;St Albans Bypass&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1960, the &lt;a href=\"Ahmed%20Hamdi%20Tunnel\"&gt;Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1981, the &lt;a href=\"Thames%20Barrier\"&gt;Thames Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Joint%20European%20Torus\"&gt;Joint European Torus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drax%20power%20station\"&gt;Drax Power Station&lt;/a&gt; all completed in 1984, the &lt;a href=\"Merry%20Hill%20Shopping%20Centre\"&gt;Merry Hill Shopping Centre&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1985, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Albert%20Dock%2C%20Liverpool\"&gt;Albert Dock refurbishment&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1988, the &lt;a href=\"A55%20road\"&gt;Conwy Road Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1991, the &lt;a href=\"Channel%20Tunnel\"&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1994, the &lt;a href=\"Medway%20Tunnel\"&gt;Medway Road Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1996, the &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Designer%20Outlet\"&gt;Swindon Designer Outlet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Swindon\"&gt;Swindon&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1997,\n &lt;a href=\"Canary%20Wharf%20tube%20station\"&gt;Canary Wharf tube station&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1999 and the &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Lynch%20Tunnel\"&gt;Jack Lynch Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; also completed in 1999."
