    "text": "Bedgebury Forest is a forest surrounding &lt;a href=\"Bedgebury%20National%20Pinetum\"&gt;Bedgebury National Pinetum&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Flimwell\"&gt;Flimwell&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast to the National Pinetum, which contains exclusively &lt;a href=\"conifer\"&gt;conifer&lt;/a&gt;ous trees, the forest contains both deciduous and coniferous species. It forms part of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Weald%20Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty&lt;/a&gt;, and is one of the so-called \"Seven Wonders Of The Weald\". Bedgebury Forest has facilities for &lt;a href=\"cycling\"&gt;cycling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mountain%20biking\"&gt;mountain biking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"equestrianism\"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orienteering\"&gt;orienteering&lt;/a&gt; and adventure play.\nHistory.\nBedgebury is first mentioned in an &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt; charter in AD 841, the name deriving from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Abycgan\"&gt;bycgan&lt;/a&gt;\", meaning \"buy\", and the &lt;a href=\"Kentish%20%28Old%20English%29\"&gt;Kentish&lt;/a&gt; , meaning \"to bend or turn\", possibly in reference to a stream. \nBedgebury Forest has always been wooded and is classed as an &lt;a href=\"ancient%20woodland\"&gt;ancient woodland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ericaceae\"&gt;Heather&lt;/a&gt; is present, which indicates that parts of the forest may have been managed as wooded &lt;a href=\"Heath%20%28habitat%29\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt;. Streams in the Forest show evidence of dams, storing water for the &lt;a href=\"Wealden%20iron%20industry\"&gt;Wealden iron industry&lt;/a&gt; and later the ornamental lakes on the Bedgebury Estate. \nGeography.\nBedgebury Forest is located between &lt;a href=\"Goudhurst\"&gt;Goudhurst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hawkhurst\"&gt;Hawkhurst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flimwell\"&gt;Flimwell&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Weald\"&gt;High Weald&lt;/a&gt; of Kent. It is situated on a high plateau, amongst the rolling hills of the &lt;a href=\"Wealden%20Group\"&gt;Wealden Group&lt;/a&gt;. The geology is mostly &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;, and the soil is poor and &lt;a href=\"soil%20pH\"&gt;acidic&lt;/a&gt;, which is the reason for the woodland's persistence: better, more accessible land was cleared for agriculture long ago. Bedgebury Forest falls within the &lt;a href=\"drainage%20basin\"&gt;catchment areas&lt;/a&gt; of the rivers &lt;a href=\"River%20Medway\"&gt;Medway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Rother%2C%20East%20Sussex\"&gt;Rother&lt;/a&gt;. \nActivities.\nBedgebury Forest is open to the public and provides facilities for cycling, mountain biking, riding, orienteering and adventure play. The network of paths and tracks that run through the forest provide opportunities for walking and running. \nCycling.\nThere are of surfaced cycle track and of single-track mountain-bike routes, and a \"free-ride\" area has been set up that allows riders to perform jumps and stunts. The Visitor Centre provides cycles for hire. In 2006 Bedgebury Forest Cycling Club was set up.\nRunning and orienteering.\nBedgebury Forest has four orienteering routes of varying difficulty levels, designed by a &lt;a href=\"British%20Orienteering%20Federation\"&gt;British Orienteering Federation&lt;/a&gt;-affiliated group. The shortest is , the longest is , with maps provided by the Visitor Centre. Bedgebury Forest also hosts an annual &lt;a href=\"10%2C000%20metres\"&gt;10 km&lt;/a&gt; charity run.\nHorseback Riding.\nThere are dedicated way-marked horse-riding trails across the forest that link to existing &lt;a href=\"Rights%20of%20the%20way%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;bridlepaths&lt;/a&gt;, creating a network of horse-friendly routes. Riders must be in possession of a TROT permit.\nAdventure play.\nBedgebury Forest has a specially designed adventure play area incorporating trails, swings, climbing walls and other child play facilities. A &lt;a href=\"Go%20Ape\"&gt;Go Ape&lt;/a&gt; adventure course was installed in spring 2007."
