    "text": "There are about 110 species of &lt;a href=\"reptiles\"&gt;reptiles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them are small or rarely seen. But there are a few which are large or prominent. The largest reptiles which can be found in Singapore are the &lt;a href=\"Crocodylus%20porosus\"&gt;estuarine crocodile&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"reticulated%20python\"&gt;reticulated python&lt;/a&gt;. The ones most commonly seen in urban areas are the house geckos (typically called house lizard by the lay-person) and the non-native &lt;a href=\"Calotes%20versicolor\"&gt;changeable lizard&lt;/a&gt;. The changeable lizard has pushed the local &lt;a href=\"Bronchocela%20cristatella\"&gt;green crested lizard&lt;/a&gt; into forested areas.\nIn gardens and parks, one can often see &lt;a href=\"Mabuya%20multifasciata\"&gt;common sun skinks&lt;/a&gt;, the introduced &lt;a href=\"red-eared%20slider\"&gt;red-eared slider&lt;/a&gt;s and flying lizards.\n&lt;a href=\"Asian%20water%20monitor\"&gt;Water monitor&lt;/a&gt;s are common in rivers and mangrove. Another monitor that can be found in Singapore is the &lt;a href=\"clouded%20monitor\"&gt;clouded monitor&lt;/a&gt;, which is a forest species. It is smaller than the Malayan water monitor, has slit nostrils and is paler in colour. In 2008, the Dumeril's monitor was rediscovered in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. This goes to show that there can still be surprises in the forests of Singapore.\n&lt;a href=\"Equatorial%20spitting%20cobra\"&gt;Equatorial spitting cobra&lt;/a&gt;s can still be found in desolated urban areas of Singapore. The bigger &lt;a href=\"king%20cobra\"&gt;king cobra&lt;/a&gt; is much rarer. The &lt;a href=\"banded%20krait\"&gt;banded krait&lt;/a&gt; sometimes show up as road kills. There are also 2 coral snake and 9 sea snake species.\nList of reptiles.\nOrder &lt;a href=\"Squamata\"&gt;Squamata&lt;/a&gt; (lizards and snakes).\nFamily &lt;a href=\"Colubridae\"&gt;Colubridae&lt;/a&gt; (colubrids).\nSubfamily Sibynophiinae\nSubfamily Natricinae\nSubfamily Calamariinae\nSubfamily Ahaetullinae\nSubfamily Colubrinae"
