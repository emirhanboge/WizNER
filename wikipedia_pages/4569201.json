    "text": "Garth Hill (usually called The Garth, or Garth Mountain, \"Mynydd y Garth\" in Welsh) is a &lt;a href=\"Marilyn%20%28geography%29\"&gt;hill&lt;/a&gt; located in between the communities of &lt;a href=\"Llantwit%20Fardre\"&gt;Llantwit Fardre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pentyrch\"&gt;Pentyrch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. The Garth can be seen from nearly the whole of the city of &lt;a href=\"Cardiff\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Taff%20Valley\"&gt;Taff Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and on a sunny, clear day as far as &lt;a href=\"Weston-super-Mare\"&gt;Weston-super-Mare&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Channel\"&gt;Bristol Channel&lt;/a&gt; in southwest England. It lies adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"River%20Taff\"&gt;Taff Vale&lt;/a&gt; with the village of &lt;a href=\"Pentyrch\"&gt;Pentyrch&lt;/a&gt; on one side and looks down onto the small villages of &lt;a href=\"Gwaelod-y-Garth\"&gt;Gwaelod-y-Garth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taff%27s%20Well\"&gt;Taff's Well&lt;/a&gt;. The Garth has a number of &lt;a href=\"tumuli\"&gt;tumuli&lt;/a&gt; on its top. These are burial sites dating from the early to middle &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Age\"&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt;.\nFine views of Cardiff and the Taff valley are obtained from the prominent crag.\nThe Garth has a sister hill, the Lesser Garth. The Lesser Garth is of &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;, which is extensively quarried with much of the hill removed; it was also formerly mined for &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt;. The valley between the two is eroded in softer &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; measures, shales in the main, while the Garth is formed of the resistant &lt;a href=\"Pennant%20Measures\"&gt;Pennant sandstone&lt;/a&gt; formation.\nUntil the 19th century, the valley and the lower slopes of the Garth facing Taff's Well were full of small &lt;a href=\"coal%20mine\"&gt;coal mine&lt;/a&gt;s which fed the &lt;a href=\"ironworks\"&gt;ironworks&lt;/a&gt; below in the &lt;a href=\"River%20Taff\"&gt;River Taff&lt;/a&gt; valley, opposite &lt;a href=\"Taff%27s%20Well\"&gt;Taff's Well&lt;/a&gt;. There is now little trace of these although \"Y Lan Colliery\" has recently had its portal partly restored as a memorial to an explosion in 1875. A cleared path now leads to this, near the primary school. The access road to Pentyrch village, Heol Goch, runs between the main and lesser Garth.\n&lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Monger\"&gt;Christopher Monger&lt;/a&gt;, a native of Taff's Well, wrote the novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Englishman%20who%20Went%20up%20a%20Hill%20but%20Came%20down%20a%20Mountain\"&gt;The Englishman who Went up a Hill but Came down a Mountain&lt;/a&gt;\". The location of the fictional \"Ffynnon Garw\" above the &lt;a href=\"writer%27s%20home\"&gt;writer's home&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; suggests that it is the Garth and the mound on which the &lt;a href=\"Triangulation%20station\"&gt;trigonometrical point&lt;/a&gt; stands is a Bronze Age &lt;a href=\"burial%20mound\"&gt;burial mound&lt;/a&gt;. Monger adapted the story for the 1995 &lt;a href=\"The%20Englishman%20who%20Went%20up%20a%20Hill%20but%20Came%20down%20a%20Mountain\"&gt;film of the same title&lt;/a&gt; on which he was the &lt;a href=\"Film%20director\"&gt;director&lt;/a&gt;. The popularity of the film has resulted in a stream of visitors climbing to the summit of Garth Mountain to view the location."
