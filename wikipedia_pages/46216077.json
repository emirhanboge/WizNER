    "text": "Teldenia melanosticta is a &lt;a href=\"moth\"&gt;moth&lt;/a&gt; in the family &lt;a href=\"Drepanidae\"&gt;Drepanidae&lt;/a&gt;. It was described by Wilkinson in 1967. It is found on &lt;a href=\"Fergusson%20Island\"&gt;Fergusson Island&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"New%20Guinea\"&gt;New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe length of the forewings is 9.5\u201312\u00a0mm for males and 10.5-14.5\u00a0mm for females. The forewings have a double postmedial and single subterminal and terminal fasciae. The distal line of the postmedial fascia is thin and pale brown and the proximal line is reduced to dark brown spots. The subterminal\nfascia is light brown and the terminal fascia dark brown, sometimes reduced to spots between the veins. The hindwings are similar, but the postmedial fascia retains its position and the subterminal fascia ends at the anal angle."
