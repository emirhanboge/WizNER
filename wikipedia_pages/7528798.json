    "text": "Pickup Truck Racing is an &lt;a href=\"auto%20racing\"&gt;auto racing&lt;/a&gt; series, running in the United Kingdom, including races on &lt;a href=\"Road%20racing\"&gt;road courses&lt;/a&gt; and (historically) &lt;a href=\"oval%20track%20racing\"&gt;oval&lt;/a&gt;s. It was the only racing series that raced on the Oval Circuit at &lt;a href=\"Rockingham%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Rockingham Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt; until it closed in 2018.\nHistory.\nLaunched in 1997 by Sonny Howard, the Pickup Truck Racing series, intended to bring the American &lt;a href=\"pickup%20truck\"&gt;pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; culture to Europe, is for purpose-built racing specials. They have a tubular &lt;a href=\"space%20frame\"&gt;space frame&lt;/a&gt; chassis, are powered by a 2-litre multi-valve twin-cam engine and weigh . The &lt;a href=\"Truck%20racing\"&gt;race trucks&lt;/a&gt; are designed to place an emphasis on driver ability.\nIn 2001, the Pickup series became the main support for the Rockingham-based oval &lt;a href=\"VSR%20V8%20Trophy\"&gt;SCSA&lt;/a&gt; (then called ASCAR) racing series. At this time the pickups were &lt;a href=\"Right-%20and%20left-hand%20traffic\"&gt;right hand drive&lt;/a&gt; in configuration and as such not permitted to race on the anti-clockwise 1.5-mile speedway. An &lt;a href=\"Oval%20track%20racing\"&gt;oval course&lt;/a&gt; was created to allow the drivers to compete.\nFor the 2003 season, the pickups were converted to left hand drive and finally allowed onto the oval track, as can be seen.\nPickup Truck Racing is unique in 'big' oval racing, in that unlike e.g. &lt;a href=\"NASCAR\"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt;, the trucks have rain tyres, wipers and rear safety lights, and will race on the ovals in the wet. Speeds are about slower than when racing in fully dry conditions.\nPickup Truck Racing is also the only racing series in the UK for which no race-by-race entry fees are charged. &lt;a href=\"Mallory%20Park\"&gt;Mallory Park&lt;/a&gt; continues to host oval events in the series following the closure of &lt;a href=\"Rockingham%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Rockingham Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt;.\nTechnical specification.\nPickup Truck Racing is a single make series, and the trucks are governed by the Pickup Truck Racing regulations. The chassis is made by SHP Engineering, who are also responsible for the vehicle used in &lt;a href=\"T%20Cars\"&gt;T Cars&lt;/a&gt;, a series for young drivers.\nThe main flexibility in the regulations comes in the choice of engine. From 2011 the trucks could be fitted with either a &lt;a href=\"Vauxhall%20Motors\"&gt;Vauxhall&lt;/a&gt; petrol injected 2-litre red top engine or a &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Duratec%20engine\"&gt;Ford Duratec engine&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are &lt;a href=\"four-cylinder%20engine\"&gt;four-cylinder engine&lt;/a&gt;s with a 2-litre capacity and 16 &lt;a href=\"Poppet%20valve\"&gt;valves&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2010, the front end of the pickup trucks was changed with the choice of either an Isuzu Denver Max LE or a Ford Ranger front. Later in the year a Vauxhall front was then also introduced to the championship.\nRace format.\nUnder normal circumstances race weekends follow the traditional format of practice and qualifying on the Saturday, and two races on Sunday. Qualifying is used to shake the car down and work on the setup, and to meet the &lt;a href=\"Motor%20Sports%20Association\"&gt;MSA&lt;/a&gt; requirements for race entry of three qualifying laps, and not to set the starting grid.\nThe grid is set by reversing the top ten qualifiers (whoever qualifies 10th will be on pole, and whoever qualifies 1st will start from 10th). The top ten qualifiers also receive points, starting from 20 and decreasing by two for every place until 10th place, after which drivers receive zero points. &lt;a href=\"Rookie\"&gt;Rookie&lt;/a&gt;s always start from the rear of the grid as do competitors who have broken seals on controlled components such as differentials. Drivers can also elect to start from the back should they wish to do so.\nAt some circuits, qualifying takes place on Saturday morning, with the first race on Saturday afternoon and the second on Sunday.\nPrevious seasons.\nFor the 2009 season, races took place on weekends between March and November. There were racing weekends at six different circuits; the majority of the races were held at &lt;a href=\"Rockingham%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Rockingham Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt; but others were held at &lt;a href=\"Brands%20Hatch\"&gt;Brands Hatch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thruxton%20Circuit\"&gt;Thruxton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silverstone%20Circuit\"&gt;Silverstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pembrey%20Circuit\"&gt;Pembrey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Donington%20Park\"&gt;Donington Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oulton%20Park\"&gt;Oulton Park&lt;/a&gt;. Each round comprised two races, making a twenty-two round competition in total.\n2009 saw a number of rule changes:\nQualifying\nOne qualifying session was held, split into two sections. The fastest ten drivers in the first session made up the first ten places on the grid, but in reverse qualification order. The second session was be the same, but for race two.\nSuccess ballast\nThe podium finishers in each race were subject to the application of success ballast as follows:\n1st: 30\u00a0kg\n2nd: 20\u00a0kg\n3rd: 10\u00a0kg\nBallast was applied up to a maximum of 70\u00a0kg. 10\u00a0kg was removed each time a truck finished outside of the top three.\nSprint/feature races\nTwo events hosted a Sprint/Feature race format, one at Rockingham and one at a road course.\nThe series continued to operate two championships: the Oval Championship and the Overall Championship.\nPrevious champions.\n\"Note: 1997 was the inaugural year and as such, races were not part of a championship.\"\nPoints system.\nAny other classified finishers receive 20 points and any non-finishers receive 10 points except in the case of disqualification."
