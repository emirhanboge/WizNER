    "text": "The Spirit is a fictional masked crimefighter created by cartoonist &lt;a href=\"Will%20Eisner\"&gt;Will Eisner&lt;/a&gt;. He first appeared June 2, 1940, as the main feature of a 16-page, &lt;a href=\"tabloid%20%28paper%20size%29\"&gt;tabloid&lt;/a&gt;-sized, newsprint comic book insert distributed in the Sunday edition of &lt;a href=\"Register%20and%20Tribune%20Syndicate\"&gt;Register and Tribune Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; newspapers; it was ultimately carried by 20 Sunday newspapers, with a combined circulation of five million copies during the 1940s. \"The Spirit Section\", as the insert was popularly known, continued until October 5, 1952. It generally included two other four-page strips (initially \"&lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Mystic\"&gt;Mr. Mystic&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Luck%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Lady Luck&lt;/a&gt;\"), plus filler material. Eisner, the overall editor, wrote and drew most Spirit entries, with the uncredited assistance of his studio of assistants and collaborators, though with Eisner's singular vision a unifying factor.\n\"The Spirit\" chronicles the adventures of a masked &lt;a href=\"vigilante\"&gt;vigilante&lt;/a&gt; who fights crime with the blessing of the city's police commissioner Dolan, an old friend. Despite the Spirit's origin as detective/criminologist Denny Colt, his real identity was rarely referred to after his first appearance, and for all intents and purposes he was simply \"The Spirit\". The stories are presented in a wide variety of styles, from straightforward &lt;a href=\"crime%20drama\"&gt;crime drama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hardboiled\"&gt;noir&lt;/a&gt; to lighthearted adventure, from &lt;a href=\"Mystery%20fiction\"&gt;mystery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horror%20fiction\"&gt;horror&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"comedy\"&gt;comedy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Romance%20comics%20in%20the%20United%20States%20%281946%E2%80%931975%29\"&gt;love stories&lt;/a&gt;, often with hybrid elements that twisted genre and reader expectations.\nFrom the 1960s to 1980s, a handful of new Eisner Spirit stories appeared in &lt;a href=\"Harvey%20Comics\"&gt;Harvey Comics&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere, and &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Publishing\"&gt;Warren Publishing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kitchen%20Sink%20Press\"&gt;Kitchen Sink Press&lt;/a&gt; variously reprinted the newspaper feature in black-and-white comics magazines and in color comic books. In the 1990s and 2000s, Kitchen Sink Press and &lt;a href=\"DC%20Comics\"&gt;DC Comics&lt;/a&gt; also published new Spirit stories by other writers and artists.\nIn 2011, &lt;a href=\"IGN\"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt; ranked the Spirit as 21st in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of all time.\nPublication history.\nIn late 1939, &lt;a href=\"Everett%20M.%20%26quot%3BBusy%26quot%3B%20Arnold\"&gt;Everett M. \"Busy\" Arnold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"publisher\"&gt;publisher&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Quality%20Comics\"&gt;Quality Comics&lt;/a&gt; comic-book line, began exploring an expansion into newspaper Sunday supplements, aware that many newspapers felt they had to compete with the suddenly burgeoning new medium of &lt;a href=\"American%20comic%20books\"&gt;American comic books&lt;/a&gt;, as exemplified by the \"Chicago Tribune Comic Book\", premiering two months before \"The Spirit Section\". Arnold compiled a presentation piece with existing Quality Comics material. An editor of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Star\"&gt;The Washington Star&lt;/a&gt;\" liked &lt;a href=\"George%20Brenner\"&gt;George Brenner&lt;/a&gt;'s comic-book feature \"&lt;a href=\"Clock%20%28comics%29\"&gt;The Clock&lt;/a&gt;\", but not Brenner's art, and was favorably disposed toward a &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Fine\"&gt;Lou Fine&lt;/a&gt; strip. Arnold, concerned over the meticulous Fine's slowness and his ability to meet deadlines, claimed it was the work of Eisner, Fine's boss at the &lt;a href=\"Eisner%20%26amp%3B%20Iger\"&gt;Eisner &amp; Iger&lt;/a&gt; studio, from which Arnold bought his outsourced comics work.\nIn \"late '39, just before &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; time\", Eisner recalled in 1979, \"Arnold came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom\". In a 2004 interview, Eisner elaborated on that meeting:\nEisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright the feature but, \"Written down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold\u2014 and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership\u2014 Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership.\" This would include the eventual backup features, \"&lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Mystic\"&gt;Mr. Mystic&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Luck%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Lady Luck&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSelling his share of their firm to Iger, who would continue to package comics as the S. M. Iger Studio and as Phoenix Features through 1955, for $20,000, Eisner left to create \"The Spirit Section\". \"They gave me an adult audience\", Eisner said in 1997, \"and I wanted to write better things than superheroes. Comic books were a ghetto. I sold my part of the enterprise to my associate and then began The Spirit. They wanted an heroic character, a costumed character. They asked me if he'd have a costume. And I put a mask on him and said, 'Yes, he has a costume!'\"\nThe character and the types of stories Eisner would tell, Eisner said in 1978, derived from his desire\nThe character's name, he said in that interview, came from Arnold: \"When 'Busy' Arnold called, he suggested a kind of ghost or some kind of metaphysical character. He said, 'How about a thing called the Ghost?' and I said, 'Naw, that's not any good,' and he said, 'Well, then, call it the Spirit; there's nothing like that around.' I said, 'Well, I don't know what you mean.,' and he said, 'Well, you can figure \"that\" out\u2014I just like the words \"the Spirit.\"' He was calling from a bar somewhere, I think... [A]nd actually, the more I thought about it the more I realized I didn't care about the name.\"\n\"The Spirit\", an initially eight (and later seven) page urban-crimefighter series, ran with the initial backup features \"Mr. Mystic\" and \"Lady Luck\" in a 16-page Sunday supplement (colloquially called \"The Spirit Section\") that was eventually distributed in 20 newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies. It premiered June 2, 1940, and continued through 1952. From 1940\u20131950, &lt;a href=\"Everett%20M.%20%26quot%3BBusy%26quot%3B%20Arnold\"&gt;Busy Arnold&lt;/a&gt; reprinted \"Spirit\" stories under his &lt;a href=\"Quality%20Comics\"&gt;Quality Comics&lt;/a&gt; banner, first individually from 1940\u20131947 as one of the features in ninety-two issues of \"&lt;a href=\"Police%20Comics\"&gt;Police Comics&lt;/a&gt;\" (#11\u2013102), and from 1944\u20131950 as twenty-two issues of an associated \"Spirit\" comic book with several stories per issue. From 1952\u20131954, &lt;a href=\"Fiction%20House\"&gt;Fiction House&lt;/a&gt; published five issues of their own \"Spirit\" reprint comic book, continuing this process.\nEisner was &lt;a href=\"military%20conscription\"&gt;drafted&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Army\"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; in late 1941, \"and then had about another half-year which the government gave me to clean up my affairs before going off\" to fight in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. In his absence, the newspaper syndicate used ghost writers and artists to continue the strip, including &lt;a href=\"Manly%20Wade%20Wellman\"&gt;Manly Wade Wellman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Woolfolk\"&gt;William Woolfolk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Cole%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Jack Cole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Fine\"&gt;Lou Fine&lt;/a&gt;.\nEisner's rumpled, masked hero (with his headquarters under the tombstone of his supposedly deceased true identity, Denny Colt) and his gritty, detailed view of big-city life (based on Eisner's Jewish upbringing in New York City) both reflected and anticipated the \"&lt;a href=\"Film%20noir\"&gt;noir&lt;/a&gt;\" outlook of film and fiction in the 1940s. Eisner said in 2001 that he created the strip as a vehicle to explore various genres: \"When I created The Spirit, I never had any intention of creating a superhero. I never felt The Spirit would dominate the feature. He served as a sort of an identity for the strip. The stories were what I was interested in.\" In some episodes, the nominal hero makes a brief, almost incidental appearance while the story focuses on a real-life drama played out in streets, dilapidated &lt;a href=\"tenements\"&gt;tenements&lt;/a&gt;, and smoke-filled back rooms. Yet along with &lt;a href=\"violence\"&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pathos\"&gt;pathos&lt;/a&gt;, the feature lived on &lt;a href=\"humor\"&gt;humor&lt;/a&gt;, both subtle and overt. He was shot, knocked silly, bruised, often amazed into near immobility and constantly confused by beautiful women.\nThe feature ended with the October 5, 1952, edition. As \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Comics%20Journal\"&gt;The Comics Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" editor-publisher &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Groth\"&gt;Gary Groth&lt;/a&gt; wrote, \"By the late '40s, Eisner's participation in the strip had dwindled to a largely supervisory role. ... Eisner hired &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Grandenetti\"&gt;Jerry Grandenetti&lt;/a&gt; and Jim Dixon to occasionally ink his pencils. By 1950, &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Feiffer\"&gt;Jules Feiffer&lt;/a&gt; was writing most of the strips, and Grandenetti, Dixon, and Al Wenzel were drawing them.\" Grandenetti, who &lt;a href=\"penciller\"&gt;penciled&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"ghostwriter\"&gt;ghost-artist&lt;/a&gt; under Eisner's byline, said in 2005 that before the feature's demise, Eisner had \"tried everything. Had me penciling 'The Spirit'. Later on it was Wally Wood\", who drew the final installments.\nFictional character biography.\nThe Spirit, referred to in one newspaper article cited below as \"the only real middle-class crimefighter\", was the hero persona of young detective/criminologist Denny Colt. Presumed killed in the first three pages of the premiere story, Colt later revealed to his friend, Central City Police Commissioner Dolan, that he had in fact gone into suspended animation caused by one of archvillain Dr. Cobra's experiments. When Colt awakened in Wildwood Cemetery, he established a base there (underneath his own tombstone) and, using his new-found anonymity, began a life of fighting &lt;a href=\"crime\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; wearing a simple costume consisting of a blue &lt;a href=\"domino%20mask\"&gt;domino mask&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"business%20suit\"&gt;business suit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fedora%20hat\"&gt;fedora hat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gloves\"&gt;gloves&lt;/a&gt; (plus a white &lt;a href=\"shirt\"&gt;shirt&lt;/a&gt; and red &lt;a href=\"necktie\"&gt;necktie&lt;/a&gt;). While elements of this basic costume occasionally vary (depending on the Spirit's circumstances and where he is in the world), he is always depicted wearing his blue domino mask and blue leather gloves. The Spirit dispensed &lt;a href=\"justice\"&gt;justice&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of his assistant, Ebony White, funding his adventures with an inheritance from his late father, Denny Colt Sr., and the rewards from capturing various villains.\nThe Spirit originally was based in New York City, but this was quickly changed to the fictional \"Central City\". Not tied to one locale, his adventures took him around the globe and even to the Moon. He met eccentrics, kooks, and &lt;a href=\"femme%20fatale\"&gt;femme fatale&lt;/a&gt;s, bringing his own form of justice to all of them. The story changed continually, but certain themes remained constant: the love between the Spirit and Dolan's feisty &lt;a href=\"protofeminist\"&gt;protofeminist&lt;/a&gt; daughter Ellen; the annual \"&lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; Spirit\" stories; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Octopus%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Octopus&lt;/a&gt; (a psychopathic criminal mastermind who was never seen, except for his distinctive purple gloves).\nEbony White.\nEisner was criticized for his depiction of &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20White\"&gt;Ebony White&lt;/a&gt;, the Spirit's &lt;a href=\"African-American\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sidekick\"&gt;sidekick&lt;/a&gt;. The character's name is a racial &lt;a href=\"pun\"&gt;pun&lt;/a&gt;, and his facial features, including large white eyes and thick pinkish lips, are typical of racial &lt;a href=\"blackface\"&gt;blackface&lt;/a&gt; caricatures popular throughout the \"&lt;a href=\"Jim%20Crow%20laws\"&gt;Jim Crow&lt;/a&gt;\" era. Eisner later admitted to consciously stereotyping the character, but said he tried to do so with \"responsibility\", and argued that \"at the time humor consisted in our society of bad English and physical difference in identity\". The character, who was consistently treated with respect by the strip's fellow cast-members, developed beyond the stereotype as the series progressed, and Eisner also introduced such African-American characters as the no-nonsense Detective Grey who defied popular stereotypes.\nEbony debuted as a resourceful taxi driver in the first \"Spirit Section\". He became a mainstay of the strip and a principal member of the Spirit's supporting cast until Eisner phased him out of the narrative in mid-1949 and replaced him with another assistant, a Caucasian boy named Sammy. Ebony's last \"starring\" role in a Spirit story (a semi-regular event in which he was the focus of the story rather than the Spirit himself) was \"Young Dr. Ebony\", published on May 29, 1949.\nSammy first appeared in \"The Ballgame\", published July 31, 1949, part of a six-episode arc set in the South Seas, in which Ebony does not appear. Sammy returns to Central City with the Spirit in \"The Return\", published August 14, 1949, and is welcomed into the cast by Ebony, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen Dolan. Ebony makes two wordless, one-panel appearances in the next two installments, \"The Candidate\" and \"White Cloud\" (August 21 and 28, 1949) before making his final appearance in five panels of \"Lurid Love\" (September 18, 1949). After this (and apart from one final mention of his name in the text-based splash page of \"The Inner Voice\", published November 6, 1949), Ebony left the strip without fanfare or explanation, and Sammy functioned as the Spirit's assistant for the strip's final three years. An adult Ebony appears as an office worker in a one-off Spirit story that appeared January 9, 1966, in the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune\"&gt;New York Herald Tribune&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn an accompanying feature article in issue of the \"New York Herald Tribune\", Eisner's former office manager Marilyn Mercer wrote, \"Ebony never drew criticism from Negro groups (in fact, Eisner was commended by some for using him), perhaps because, although his speech pattern was early &lt;a href=\"Minstrel%20Show\"&gt;Minstrel Show&lt;/a&gt;, he himself derived from another literary tradition: he was a combination of &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Sawyer\"&gt;Tom Sawyer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Penrod\"&gt;Penrod&lt;/a&gt;, with a touch of &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Alger\"&gt;Horatio Alger&lt;/a&gt; hero, and color didn't really come into it\".\n\"Ev'ry Little Bug\".\nThe song \"Ev'ry Little Bug\" (with lyrics written by Eisner) appears regularly between 1946 and 1950. The initial lines of were first uttered in the story \"Poole's Toadstool Facial Cream\" (June 9, 1946). By the end of 1946, all of the lyrics had appeared, sung by various characters. In 1947, Eisner collaborated with his World War II service friend Bill Harr, who composed a melody for Eisner's lyrics. The complete song appears in the April 27, 1947 \"Spirit Section\", here titled \"Ev'ry Li'l Bug\", with Ebony credited within the storyline as its composer. In the story \"Wiffenpoof\" (June 29, 1947), real-life operatic singer Robert Merrill was depicted singing the tune. Shortly afterward, the Robbins Music Corporation of New York published \"Ev'ry Little Bug\" as sheet music, with an image of Ebony on its cover page. After three more appearances in the strip, \"Ev'ry Little Bug\" remained dormant until 1987, when music producer John Christensen assembled a recording featuring five versions of the tune, released by Kitchen Sink as a picture disc with an exclusive Spirit/Ebony image illustrated by Eisner on one side and the original art for the sheet music on the other. The record featured actor &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Mumy\"&gt;Billy Mumy&lt;/a&gt; playing guitar on some tracks.\nThe Spirit and John Law.\nSeveral Spirit stories, such as the first appearance of Sand Saref, were retooled from a failed publishing venture featuring an &lt;a href=\"eyepatch\"&gt;eyepatch&lt;/a&gt;ed, &lt;a href=\"pipe-smoking\"&gt;pipe-smoking&lt;/a&gt; detective named &lt;a href=\"John%20Law%20%28comics%29\"&gt;John Law&lt;/a&gt;. Law and his shoeshine-boy sidekick, Nubbin, starred in several adventures planned for a new comics series. These completed adventures were eventually adapted into Spirit stories, with John Law's eyepatch being changed to the Spirit's mask, and Nubbin redrawn as Willum Waif or other Spirit supporting characters.\nThe original John Law stories were restored and published in \"Will Eisner's John Law: Dead Man Walking\" (&lt;a href=\"IDW%20Publishing\"&gt;IDW Publishing&lt;/a&gt;, 2004), a collection of stories that also features new adventures by writer-artist Gary Chaloner, starring John Law, Nubbin, and other Eisner creations, including \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Luck%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Lady Luck&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Mystic\"&gt;Mr. Mystic&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAssistants and collaborators.\nLike most artists working in newspaper comic strips, Eisner after a time employed a studio of assistants who, on any given week's story, might draw or simply ink backgrounds, ink parts of Eisner's main characters (such as clothing or shoes), or as eventually occurred, ghost-draw the strip entirely. Eisner also eventually used ghostwriters, generally in collaboration with him.\n&lt;a href=\"Jules%20Feiffer\"&gt;Jules Feiffer&lt;/a&gt;, who began as an art assistant circa 1946 and later became the primary writer through the strip's end in 1952, recalled, \"When I first worked for Will there was &lt;a href=\"John%20Spranger%20%28comics%29\"&gt;John Spranger&lt;/a&gt;, who was his penciler and a wonderful draftsman; better than Will. There was &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Rosen%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Sam Rosen&lt;/a&gt;, the lettering man. &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Grandenetti\"&gt;Jerry Grandenetti&lt;/a&gt; came a little after me and did backgrounds, and Jerry had some architectural background. His drawing was stiff but loosened up after a while, but he drew backgrounds and inked them beautifully. And &lt;a href=\"Abe%20Kanegson\"&gt;Abe Kanegson&lt;/a&gt;, who was my best friend in the office, was a jack-of-all-trades but mostly did lettering and backgrounds after Jerry left. Abe was a mentor to me.\"\nEisner's studio also included:\nLatter-day Spirit comics.\n1960s.\nA five-page Spirit story, set in New York City, appeared as part of a January 9, 1966, article about the Spirit in the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune\"&gt;New York Herald Tribune&lt;/a&gt;\".\n&lt;a href=\"Harvey%20Comics\"&gt;Harvey Comics&lt;/a&gt; reprinted several Spirit stories in two giant-size, 25-cent comic books published October 1966 and March 1967, each with new Eisner covers. The first of these two 60-page issues opened with a new seven-page retelling of the Spirit's origin by writer-penciler-inker Eisner (with inking assist by Chuck Kramer). Also new was the text feature \"An Interview with the Spirit\", credited to Marilyn Mercer; and writer-artist Eisner's two-page featurette \"Spirit Lab: Invincible Devices\". Seven 1948\u20131949 Spirit stories were reprinted. The second issue opened with a new seven-page story by writer-artist Eisner, \"Octopus: The Life Story of the King of Crime,\" giving the heretofore unrevealed origin of the Spirit's nemesis The Octopus, as well as his given name (Zitzbath Zark). Also new was the two-page text feature \"The Spirit Answers Your Mail\", and writer-artist Eisner's two-page featurette \"The Spirit Lab: The Man from MSD\". Reprinted were seven 1948\u201350 \"Spirit\" stories.\n1970s.\nIn 1973, &lt;a href=\"Denis%20Kitchen\"&gt;Denis Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kitchen%20Sink%20Press\"&gt;Kitchen Sink Press&lt;/a&gt; published two issues of \"The Spirit\" (also known as \"Underground Spirit\"), consisting primarily of reprints with original front and back covers, and featuring introductions by &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Horn\"&gt;Maurice Horn&lt;/a&gt; and John Benson. The first issue includes four original single-page stories, while the second issue (cover titled \"All About P'Gell\") includes the four-page story, \"The Capistrano Jewels.\" During this period, Eisner also released \"The Invader\", a five-page story in a one-shot Spirit publication Eisner created for his lecture at &lt;a href=\"Sheridan%20College\"&gt;Sheridan College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oakville%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Oakville, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, Canada in 1973. It was reprinted in Kitchen Sink's hardcover \"Will Eisner Color Treasury\"(1981).\nFrom 1974 to 1976, &lt;a href=\"James%20Warren%20%28publisher%29\"&gt;James Warren&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Publishing\"&gt;Warren Publishing&lt;/a&gt; published 16 issues of \"The Spirit\" (also known as \"The Spirit Magazine\"), a large black-and-white &lt;a href=\"magazine\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt; consisting of reprints with original covers (primarily by Eisner), concluding with a separate 1975 color issue, \"The Spirit Special\", which includes an afterword by &lt;a href=\"Bill%20DuBay\"&gt;Bill DuBay&lt;/a&gt;. Kitchen Sink picked up the series beginning in 1977 with issue 17, eventually concluding with issue 41 (June 1983). Issue 30 of the Kitchen Sink series (July 1981) features \"The Spirit &lt;a href=\"Comic%20jam\"&gt;Jam&lt;/a&gt;\", with a script from Eisner and a few penciled pages, plus contributions from 50 artists, including &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Hembeck\"&gt;Fred Hembeck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trina%20Robbins\"&gt;Trina Robbins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Leialoha\"&gt;Steve Leialoha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Miller%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Frank Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harvey%20Kurtzman\"&gt;Harvey Kurtzman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Cruse\"&gt;Howard Cruse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Bolland\"&gt;Brian Bolland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Sienkiewicz\"&gt;Bill Sienkiewicz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Byrne%20%28comics%29\"&gt;John Byrne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Corben\"&gt;Richard Corben&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1976, &lt;a href=\"Tempo%20Books\"&gt;Tempo Books&lt;/a&gt; published \"The Spirit Casebook of True Haunted Houses and Ghosts\", in which the Spirit plays the &lt;a href=\"EC%20Comics\"&gt;EC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horror%20host\"&gt;host&lt;/a&gt;, introducing \"true\" stories of haunted houses. The Spirit also makes a cameo in \"&lt;a href=\"Vampirella\"&gt;Vampirella&lt;/a&gt;\" #50 (April 1976), in the eight-page story \"The Thing in Denny Colt's Grave\".\n1980s.\nAfter \"The Spirit Magazine\" ceased publication with issue #41 (June 1983), &lt;a href=\"Kitchen%20Sink%20Press\"&gt;Kitchen Sink Press&lt;/a&gt; published a complete reprinting of the post-World War II Eisner work in a standard-formatted comic-book series, which ran 87 issues (October 1983\u2013January 1992). The series featured color stories in its first 11 issues, but switched to black-and-white from issue 12 on. Also in 1983, Kitchen Sink published \"Outer Space Spirit: 1952\", collecting the final newspaper sections (July 27, 1952 \u2013 October 5, 1952), along with the scripts for what would have been the final three sections of the \"Outer Space Spirit\" saga. The publisher additionally published the one-shot \"Will Eisner's 3-D Classics featuring The Spirit\" (Dec. 1985).\n1990s and beyond.\nIn the 1990s, Kitchen Sink published two hardcover volumes of \"The Spirit Casebook\", the first cover-titled simply \"Spirit Casebook\" (1990), and the second cover-titled \"All About P'Gell: The Spirit Casebook, Volume II\" (1998).
