    "text": "James William Dunegan (August 6, 1947 \u2013 October 20, 2014) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; player. Although he spent much of his early &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;minor league&lt;/a&gt; career as an &lt;a href=\"outfielder\"&gt;outfielder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt;, he converted to &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; in and appeared in seven &lt;a href=\"games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;, all as a &lt;a href=\"relief%20pitcher\"&gt;relief pitcher&lt;/a&gt;, that season for the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nDunegan was selected by Chicago in the second round of the &lt;a href=\"1967%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft\"&gt;1967 Major League Baseball draft&lt;/a&gt;. He hit a career-high 18 &lt;a href=\"home%20runs\"&gt;home runs&lt;/a&gt; in 1968 for the Class A &lt;a href=\"Quincy%20Cubs\"&gt;Quincy Cubs&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Midwest%20League\"&gt;Midwest League&lt;/a&gt;. After appearing as a pitcher in 14 total games during 1967\u20131968, and none in 1969, he became a full-time hurler in 1970, splitting the year between the MLB Cubs and their two top &lt;a href=\"farm%20system\"&gt;farm system&lt;/a&gt; affiliates.\nIn his debut as a pitcher, on May 30, he entered a game against the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Padres\"&gt;San Diego Padres&lt;/a&gt; with the Cubs trailing, 4\u20130, and worked four &lt;a href=\"inning%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;innings&lt;/a&gt; of one-&lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;run&lt;/a&gt; relief, enabling Chicago to climb back into a 4\u20134 tie. But the Padres broke through for one run off Dunegan to take a 5\u20134 lead, eventually pinning Dunegan with the loss. He also lost his only other Major League &lt;a href=\"decision%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt;, in June \u2014 and also against the Padres. Altogether, he pitched in innings, allowed 13 &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; and 12 &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt;, with three &lt;a href=\"strikeouts\"&gt;strikeouts&lt;/a&gt;. He left baseball after the 1972 season with a 16\u201319 &lt;a href=\"Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29\"&gt;pitching record&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; of 4.44, a .246 &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; and 37 &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s as a minor leaguer."
