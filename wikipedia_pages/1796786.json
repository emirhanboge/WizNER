    "text": "The Clan Macrae is a Highland &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20clan\"&gt;Scottish clan&lt;/a&gt;. The clan has no chief; it is therefore considered an &lt;a href=\"armigerous%20clan\"&gt;armigerous clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSurname.\nThe surname Macrae (and its variations) is an &lt;a href=\"anglicisation\"&gt;anglicisation&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"patronymic\"&gt;patronymic&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Gaelic\"&gt;Gaelic&lt;/a&gt; personal name \"MacRaith\". This &lt;a href=\"personal%20name\"&gt;personal name&lt;/a&gt; means \"son of grace\". The name is recorded numerous times in the Middle Ages, and was used by various unrelated families.\nTraditional origins of the clan.\nAccording to the late 19th-century historian &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Mackenzie%20%28historian%29\"&gt;Alexander Mackenzie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Reverend\"&gt;Rev.&lt;/a&gt; Alexander Macrae in the early 20th century, the main authority for the early history of Clan Macrae is the late 17th-century &lt;a href=\"manuscript\"&gt;manuscript&lt;/a&gt; account of the clan written by Rev. John Macrae. Alexander Macrae largely based his history of the clan upon John Macrae's earlier account.\nAccording to tradition, the Macraes were originally from Ireland and shared a common ancestry with the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Mackenzie\"&gt;Mackenzies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Maclean\"&gt;Macleans&lt;/a&gt;. The Macraes were said to have originated from Clunes, which is located near the southern shore of the &lt;a href=\"Beauly%20Firth\"&gt;Beauly Firth&lt;/a&gt;, and was within the lordship of Lovat. Alexander Macrae stated that these traditions likely refer to a period sometime in the middle of the 13th century. According to John Macrae, after a violent dispute arose between the Macraes and more powerful &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Fraser%20of%20Lovat\"&gt;Frasers of Lovat&lt;/a&gt;, three sons of the Macrae &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20clan%20chief\"&gt;chief&lt;/a&gt; set off for new lands. One of the sons settled in Brahan, near Dingwall (later the site of &lt;a href=\"Brahan%20Castle\"&gt;Brahan Castle&lt;/a&gt;); another settled in &lt;a href=\"Argyll\"&gt;Argyll&lt;/a&gt;; and the other settled in &lt;a href=\"Kintail\"&gt;Kintail&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt that time Kintail was held by the Mackenzies, and according to John Macrae's account, there were very few Mackenzies of the chiefly line and thus the chief of that clan welcomed the Macraes because they shared a common descent and could be relied upon. Although John Macrae did not know the name of the Macrae brother who settled in Kintail, he stated that this Macrae brother married the daughter, or granddaughter, of Macbeolan who possessed a large part of Kintail before Mackenzie's rise to power. Alexander Mackenzie considered this marriage to be the real reason for the loyalty given by the Macraes to their Mackenzie lords; he did not believe the Macraes and Mackenzies to share a common ancestry in the &lt;a href=\"male%20line\"&gt;male line&lt;/a&gt; as John Macrae had claimed.\nAlexander Macrae was of the opinion that these events probably took place sometime in the first half of the 14th century before the Mackenzies became firmly established in the Kintail area. He stated that there didn't appear to be any evidence that the Macraes were in the Kintail area before the time of these events, but noted that it was said that &lt;a href=\"Eilean%20Donan%20Castle\"&gt;Eilean Donan Castle&lt;/a&gt; was garrisoned by Macraes and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20MacLennan\"&gt;Maclennans&lt;/a&gt; in the late 13th century, during the period when the fortress was first taken into possession by Kenneth, founder of the Mackenzies of Kintail.\nAccording to tradition, one of the prominent ancestors of the Macraes from Kintail was &lt;a href=\"Fionnla%20Dubh%20mac%20Gillechriosd\"&gt;Fionnla Dubh mac Gillechriosd&lt;/a&gt;, According to John Macrae, Fionnla Dubh mac Gillechriosd was about two, or three, generations removed from the Macrae who settled in Kintail from Clunes. Alexander Macrae stated that Fionnla Dubh was a contemporary of Murdo Mackenzie, fifth &lt;a href=\"Chiefs%20of%20Clan%20Mackenzie\"&gt;chief of the Mackenzies of Kintail&lt;/a&gt;. In 1416, Murdo died and was succeeded by his son, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Mackenzie%20of%20Kintail\"&gt;Alexander&lt;/a&gt;. According to the traditions of John Macrae, when the bastard uncles of the young Mackenzie chief began oppressing the folk of the district, Fionnla Dubh was instrumental in retrieving him from the south of Scotland; upon Alexander's return, the Mackenzie lands were brought back under control. The main line of the Macraes from Kintail, the Macraes of Inverinate, trace their descent from Fionnla Dubh.\nHistory.\nThe Macraes are known to have been constant supporters of the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Mackenzie\"&gt;Clan Mackenzie&lt;/a&gt; in recorded times; in 1520, and for many years onwards, they were &lt;a href=\"Constable%23United_Kingdom_2\"&gt;constable&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Eilean%20Donan\"&gt;Eilean Donan Castle&lt;/a&gt;. In 1539 the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Macdonald%20of%20Sleat\"&gt;Clan Macdonald of Sleat&lt;/a&gt; besieged Eilean Donan as part of their attempt to restore the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20the%20Isles\"&gt;Lordship of the Isles&lt;/a&gt; and Duncan Macrae is credited with slaying the Macdonald chief with an arrow which brought the siege to an end. In view of their constant service to the Mackenzies, the Macraes of Kintail became known as the Mackenzies' \"shirt of &lt;a href=\"chain%20mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;\".\n17th century and civil war.\nThe Rev. Farquhar Macrae, born in 1580, Constable of Eilean Donan, was both an energetic churchman and a great Latin scholar. On his first visit to the Isle of Lewis, he is said to have baptised all the inhabitants under forty years of age, no clergyman having resided on the island during that period. His second son, John Macrae, became minister of &lt;a href=\"Dingwall\"&gt;Dingwall&lt;/a&gt; in 1640 and died in 1704.\nDuring the Civil War the Clan Macrae supported the &lt;a href=\"Cavalier\"&gt;Royalist&lt;/a&gt; cause but under the equivocating Earl of Seaforth firstly fought valiantly on the losing Stateside at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Auldearn\"&gt;Battle of Auldearn&lt;/a&gt; in May 1645 before following Seaforth to support the royalist &lt;a href=\"James%20Graham%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Montrose\"&gt;James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose&lt;/a&gt;.\nRev. Farquhar Macrae's grandson, &lt;a href=\"Donnchadh%20MacRath\"&gt;Duncan Macrae of Inverinate&lt;/a&gt; was the compiler of the famous &lt;a href=\"Fernaig%20manuscript\"&gt;Fernaig manuscript&lt;/a&gt; 1688-93.\nJacobite risings.\nIn 1721 William Ross, 6th chief of the Pitcalnie line, his brother, Robert Ross, and a force of their clansmen tried to levy rents in the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Mackenzie\"&gt;Clan Mackenzie&lt;/a&gt; lands, but were confronted by Colonel Donald Murchison and three hundred Mackenzies and Macraes. Both Walter Ross, the chief's son, and Robert's son, William, were wounded in the short &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glen%20Affric\"&gt;Battle of Glen Affric&lt;/a&gt;, and the outnumbered Rosses &lt;a href=\"parley\"&gt;parley&lt;/a&gt;ed and withdrew. Walter died of his wounds the next day. \nIn the &lt;a href=\"Jacobite%20rising%20of%201745\"&gt;Jacobite rising of 1745&lt;/a&gt;, the Macraes were divided. A number are known to have sided with the Jacobites under &lt;a href=\"George%20Mackenzie%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Cromartie\"&gt;George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie&lt;/a&gt;, while others joined the government's &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Highland%20Companies\"&gt;Independent Highland Companies&lt;/a&gt; under Captain Colin Mackenzie In June 1746 the Mackenzie Company at Shiramore in Badenoch had over sixty Macraes, including an &lt;a href=\"Ensign%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Ensign&lt;/a&gt; John MacRae.\nAmerican Revolution.\nAt the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolution\"&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, many members of Clan Macrae who had settled along the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Fear%20River\"&gt;Cape Fear River&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Colony%20of%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Colony of North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, rose up and fought under the command of Brigadier General Donald MacDonald as &lt;a href=\"Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29\"&gt;Loyalists&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Moore%27s%20Creek%20Bridge\"&gt;Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Among them was the &lt;a href=\"war%20poet\"&gt;war poet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Iain%20mac%20Mhurchaidh\"&gt;John MacRae&lt;/a&gt;, who has been termed one of the \"earliest &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Gaelic%20language\"&gt;Scottish Gaelic&lt;/a&gt; poets in &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; about whom we know anything.\"\nMacRae was taken prisoner by &lt;a href=\"Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; militia following the Loyalist defeat. His son Murdo was mortally wounded.\nEven though John MacRae is believed to have been killed in 1780, his poems and songs celebrating the Loyalist cause remain an important part of &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Gaelic%20literature\"&gt;Scottish Gaelic literature&lt;/a&gt; and are equally popular among speakers of &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Gaelic\"&gt;Canadian Gaelic&lt;/a&gt;.\nSymbols.\n&lt;a href=\"Scottish%20crest%20badge\"&gt;Clan crests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"clan%20badge\"&gt;clan badge&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"clan%20tartan\"&gt;clan tartan&lt;/a&gt;s are means of identifying and displaying members' allegiance to their clan. \nMacraes may wear on a &lt;a href=\"bonnet%20%28headgear%29\"&gt;bonnet&lt;/a&gt; or upon the chest either a badge of the Crest, \"A cubit arm grasping a sword, all proper\". encircled by a strap with the Latin motto \"FORTITUDINE\", meaning \"with fortitude\";, or the more authentic plant badge of a real sprig of &lt;a href=\"club%20moss\"&gt;club moss&lt;/a&gt;. sometimes referred to as \"staghorn grass\". It may refer to the Mackenzie chief's arms, since the Macraes proudly admit no chief of their own but are closely associated with the Mackenzies.\nThe clan's war cry \"Sgurr Uaran\" refers to &lt;a href=\"Sg%C3%B9rr%20Fhuaran\"&gt;Sg\u00f9rr Fhuaran&lt;/a&gt;, a mountain near &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Duich\"&gt;Loch Duich&lt;/a&gt; which is one of the \"&lt;a href=\"Five%20Sisters%20of%20Kintail\"&gt;Five Sisters of Kintail&lt;/a&gt;\", and a prominent rallying point in the clan's traditional lands. \n\"\"&lt;a href=\"In%20Flanders%20Fields\"&gt;In Flanders Fields&lt;/a&gt;\"\" was scribbled by a Canadian &lt;a href=\"war%20poet\"&gt;war poet&lt;/a&gt; of Scottish descent, Lieutenant-Colonel &lt;a href=\"John%20McCrae\"&gt;John McCrae&lt;/a&gt;, following the death of a close friend on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;. He threw it away, but one of his orderlies retrieved it for posterity. \nA 2/4 March for bagpipes has been composed in honour of Clan Macrae."
