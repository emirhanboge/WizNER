    "text": "George Summers (born 30 July 1941) is a Scottish retired professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt; who played in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Brentford%20F.C.\"&gt;Brentford&lt;/a&gt;. He later moved to &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nBrentford.\nSummers began his career in &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; at junior club &lt;a href=\"Shawfield%20Juniors\"&gt;Shawfield Juniors&lt;/a&gt; and moved to &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; to sign for &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South\"&gt;Third Division South&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Brentford%20F.C.\"&gt;Brentford&lt;/a&gt; in January 1959, who were at the time managed by &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malky%20McDonald\"&gt;Malky McDonald&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"George%20Francis%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;George Francis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Towers\"&gt;Jim Towers&lt;/a&gt; ahead of him in the pecking order up front, Summers initially played for the &lt;a href=\"Brentford%20Reserves\"&gt;reserve team&lt;/a&gt;. He failed to make a first team appearance during the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"1958%E2%80%9359%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1958\u201359&lt;/a&gt; season and failed to receive a call at all during the &lt;a href=\"1959%E2%80%9360%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1959\u201360&lt;/a&gt; season. Summers finally made his professional debut, nearly two years after signing, in a 4\u20133 &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; second round victory over &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Griffin%20Park\"&gt;Griffin Park&lt;/a&gt; on 25 October 1960. He made something of a breakthrough into the first team during what remained of the &lt;a href=\"1960%E2%80%9361%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1960\u201361&lt;/a&gt; season and made a total of 16 appearances, scoring six goals.\nThe departures of Towers and Francis during the 1961 off-season (though Francis would soon return) saw a space open up in the Bees' &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward line&lt;/a&gt; alongside new signing &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Brooks\"&gt;Johnny Brooks&lt;/a&gt; and Summers got his chance. He made 35 appearances and scored eight goals during the &lt;a href=\"1961%E2%80%9362%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1961\u201362&lt;/a&gt; season, at the end of which the club suffered relegation to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division\"&gt;Fourth Division&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition of new forwards &lt;a href=\"Billy%20McAdams\"&gt;Billy McAdams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Dick%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201930%29\"&gt;John Dick&lt;/a&gt; pushed Summers back into the reserves for the &lt;a href=\"1962%E2%80%9363%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1962\u201363&lt;/a&gt; season, but he still managed six goals in 15 league games and claimed the first silverware of his career, when Brentford returned to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt; as Fourth Division champions.\nSummers was mostly confined to the reserves during the &lt;a href=\"1963%E2%80%9364%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1963\u201364&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1964%E2%80%9365%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1964\u201365&lt;/a&gt; and made just 12 first team appearances, though he did enjoy some success with the reserves, by winning the &lt;a href=\"London%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;London Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1965 and scoring in the final versus &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;. Not in favour with new manager &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Cavanagh\"&gt;Tommy Cavanagh&lt;/a&gt;, Summers was released towards the end of the 1964\u201365 season. Despite never breaking into the first team, Summers scored 27 goals in 79 appearances in his six years at Griffin Park, an average of one goal every three games.\nPort Elizabeth City.\nSummers moved to &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; to link up with former Brentford teammates &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Crowe\"&gt;Matt Crowe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20McLeod%20%28footballer%20born%201932%29\"&gt;George McLeod&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; club Port Elizabeth City in 1965. He remained with the club for three years and was a part of its most successful period, finishing as National Football League runners-up in 1966 and winning the title in 1967.\nJohannesburg Corinthians.\nSummers joined fellow National Football League club Johannesburg Corinthians in 1968 and stayed with the club for one season.\nManagerial and coaching career.\nSummers &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;managed&lt;/a&gt; South African club Hume Park in the early 1980s and &lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;coached&lt;/a&gt; the Eastern Province representative team under managers Colin Trader and Daan van der Mescht, helping the club to win the &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; edition of the &lt;a href=\"Currie%20Cup\"&gt;Currie Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1981 and 1982.\nHonours.\nBrentford\nPort Elizabeth City"
