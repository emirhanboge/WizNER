    "text": "Latvian names, like in most &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an cultures, consist of two main elements: the &lt;a href=\"given%20name\"&gt;given name&lt;/a&gt; (\"v\u0101rds\") followed by &lt;a href=\"family%20name\"&gt;family name&lt;/a&gt; (\"uzv\u0101rds\"). During the &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Soviet occupation&lt;/a&gt; (1940\u20131941; 1944\u20131991) the practice of giving a &lt;a href=\"middle%20name\"&gt;middle name&lt;/a&gt; (\"otrais v\u0101rds\") was discouraged, but since the restoration of independence, Latvian legislation again allows the giving of up to two given names and it has become more common to give a middle name to children.\nLatvian male names end in &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20declension%23Masculine%20declensions\"&gt;1st or 2nd declension masculine endings&lt;/a&gt;, either \"-s/-\u0161\" or \"-is\" (with a handful of mostly foreign exceptions ending in indeclinable \"-o\", such as \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3AIvo%23Latvian\"&gt;Ivo&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Raivo\", \"Gvido\", \"Bruno\", \"Oto\" and only a few belonging to the 3rd declension ending in \"-us\", such as \"Ingus\", \"Mikus\", \"Ed\u017eus\", \"Zemgus\"). Latvian female names have the &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20declension%23Feminine%20declensions\"&gt;feminine 4th or 5th declension endings&lt;/a&gt; \"-a\" or \"-e\" respectively.\nFor centuries, one of the most popular Latvian names has been \"&lt;a href=\"J%C4%81nis\"&gt;J\u0101nis&lt;/a&gt;\", whose written use dates back to 1290. The vocative case is used when addressing someone directly, for example, \"J\u0101ni\" for \"J\u0101nis.\" The diminutive form is often used to express endearment or when addressing children, for example, addressing \"J\u0101nis\" as \"J\u0101n\u012bt\" (vocative diminutive).\nSpelling.\nWriting of Latvian names always conform to the highly phonetic &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20orthography\"&gt;Latvian orthography&lt;/a&gt; and in the case of foreign born Latvian nationals or marriages between Latvian women and foreigners (whence they assume the family name of their husband) the foreign names are modified to conform to the phonetic spelling and to acquire the respective case ending. For example, &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Depardieu\"&gt;Gerard Depardieu&lt;/a&gt; is \"\u017der\u0101rs Depardj\u0113\", &lt;a href=\"Joaquin%20Phoenix\"&gt;Joaquin Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; is \"Hoakins F\u012bnikss\" and &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; is \"Donalds Tramps\".\nThis has given rise to at least half a dozen lawsuits over the last couple decades, mostly ethnic Russian Latvian nationals not content with addition of case endings. Other examples include:\nHistory.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Christianization%20of%20Latvia\"&gt;Christianization of Latvia&lt;/a&gt; in 13th century Latvians commonly gave their children names of objects from natural surroundings, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Irbe\"&gt;Irbe&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"partridge\"&gt;partridge&lt;/a&gt;), \"&lt;a href=\"L%C4%81cis\"&gt;L\u0101cis&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;), \"&lt;a href=\"Ieva\"&gt;Ieva&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"cherry%20tree\"&gt;cherry tree&lt;/a&gt;) and \"&lt;a href=\"%C4%80bele\"&gt;\u0100bele&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"apple%20tree\"&gt;apple tree&lt;/a&gt;), many of whom later became last names. Names of the following 13th and 14th-century &lt;a href=\"fief\"&gt;fief&lt;/a&gt;-owning Baltic vassals have been recorded \u2013 \"Manegints, Radi\u0137is, Tontegode, Tots, Aulis,\" \"Ma\u017eeiki\" brothers, \"Grime\u0137is, Sirkants, Gai\u017ea, Duvkants, Dumpj\u0101ts, Treinis, Gribonis, M\u0113lvaldis, Kantebute, Stegebute, Taites, Angutis, Poja, Kr\u016bms, Pitkej\u0101nis, Tautenis, Sentots, Cielava, Kar\u012bds\" etc. After the Christianization Latvians began giving their children Christian first names, such as Marija, Anna, and P\u0113teris. Lutheran priest Christoph Harder also coined a number of new names from Latvian words for different &lt;a href=\"virtue\"&gt;virtue&lt;/a&gt;s like \"Dievm\u012blis\" (God-lover), \"Str\u0101dulis\" (hard-worker), \"\u017d\u0113l\u012bte\" (sorrowful one), and \"Skaidr\u012bte\" (clear one).\nBefore the emancipation from serfdom (1817 in &lt;a href=\"Courland\"&gt;Courland&lt;/a&gt;, 1819 in &lt;a href=\"Vidzeme\"&gt;Vidzeme&lt;/a&gt;, 1861 in &lt;a href=\"Latgale\"&gt;Latgale&lt;/a&gt;) only noblemen, free craftsmen or people living in towns had surnames. Therefore, the oldest Latvian surnames usually originate from German or Low German, reflecting the dominance of German as an official language in Latvia till the 19th century. Examples: \"Meijers/Meijere\" (German: \"Meier\", farm administrator; akin to Mayor), \"Millers/Millere\" (German: \"M\u00fcller\", miller), \"\u0160mits/\u0160mite\" (German: \"Schmidt\", smith), \"\u0160ulcs/\u0160ulca\" (German: \"Schulze\", constable), \"&lt;a href=\"Ulmanis\"&gt;Ulmanis&lt;/a&gt;\" (German: \"Ullmann\", a person from &lt;a href=\"Ulm\"&gt;Ulm&lt;/a&gt;), \"Godmanis\" (a God-man), \"P\u0113tersons\" (son of Peter). Some Latvian surnames, mainly from Latgale are of Polish or Belorussian origin by changing the final \"-ski/-cki\" to \"-skis/-ckis\", \"-czyk\" to \"-\u010diks\" or \"-vich/-wicz\" to \"-vi\u010ds\", such as \"Sokolovskis/Sokolovska\", \"Baldun\u010diks/Baldun\u010dika\" or \"Ratkevi\u010ds/Ratkevi\u010da\". However, some surnames of Latvian origin (like \"&lt;a href=\"Mucenieks\"&gt;Mucenieks&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Kalns\"&gt;Kalns&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Putns\"&gt;Putns&lt;/a&gt;\") have also been recorded as early as the 16th and 17th century, for example, among the transport workers.\nThe official records of Latvian names were often variously forcibly assimilated into the foreign culture dominant at times in Latvian lands. For example, local &lt;a href=\"pastor\"&gt;pastor&lt;/a&gt;s, who were often of &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; descent, used to issue marriage and birth certificates with &lt;a href=\"Germanization\"&gt;Germanized&lt;/a&gt; names: e.g., \"Kalns\" was written as \"Berg\" (both meaning \"&lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;\" in Latvian and German respectively). Sometimes \"de-Germanization\" produced a slightly different name, e.g., \"Daugmants\" was Germanized as \"Daugmann\" and then de-Germanized into \"Daugmanis.\" Demographer &lt;a href=\"Ilm%C4%81rs%20Me%C5%BEs\"&gt;Ilm\u0101rs Me\u017es&lt;/a&gt; has estimated that nowadays around a third of all the Latvian surnames are of German origin.\nMost Latvian peasants received their surnames in 1826 (in &lt;a href=\"Vidzeme\"&gt;Vidzeme&lt;/a&gt;), in 1835 (in &lt;a href=\"Courland\"&gt;Courland&lt;/a&gt;), and in 1866 (in &lt;a href=\"Latgale\"&gt;Latgale&lt;/a&gt;). Diminutives were the most common form of family names. Examples: \"Kalni\u0146\u0161/Kalni\u0146a\" (small hill), \"B\u0113rzi\u0146\u0161/B\u0113rzi\u0146a\" (small birch).\nDuring the times when &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; was part of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, in official usage Latvian names were commonly &lt;a href=\"Russification\"&gt;Russified&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, it followed the three-part pattern of &lt;a href=\"Russian%20names\"&gt;Russian names&lt;/a&gt;: given name, &lt;a href=\"patronymic\"&gt;patronymic&lt;/a&gt;, family name. Also, the masculine endings of first names were often truncated. For example, poet &lt;a href=\"Imants%20Ziedonis\"&gt;Imants Ziedonis&lt;/a&gt; was officially called Imant Yanovich Ziedonis (\u0418\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0442 \u042f\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0417\u0438\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0441)\nIn the 20th century, in particular, in the &lt;a href=\"interbellum\"&gt;interbellum&lt;/a&gt; period of the Latvian national movement and during the &lt;a href=\"Ulmanis%20authoritarian%20regime\"&gt;Ulmanis authoritarian regime&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1930s, when &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Germans\"&gt;Baltic Germans&lt;/a&gt; left Latvia, there was a tendency to change the Germanic names back to their Latvian origins or to adopt Latvian versions. In one such example Minister of Interior Korn\u0113lijs Veitmanis became &lt;a href=\"Korn%C4%93lijs%20Veidnieks\"&gt;Korn\u0113lijs Veidnieks&lt;/a&gt;.\nName day.\nLatvia is among the European countries that celebrate &lt;a href=\"name%20day\"&gt;name day&lt;/a&gt;s (\"v\u0101rda dienas\"), a celebration almost comparable in importance to that of a birthday. Most of them are related to the Saints' days in the Church calendar, but in recent decades new names have been added to the calendar by a special commission. Some names and their name days bear a connection with important holidays, for example, arguably one of the most important holidays, summer solstice, referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"J%C4%81%C5%86i\"&gt;J\u0101\u0146i&lt;/a&gt;\" starts on June 23 with \"L\u012bgo diena\" (name day for females named \"L\u012bga\") and continues through June 24 or &lt;a href=\"J%C4%81%C5%86i\"&gt;J\u0101\u0146i&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 name day for males named \"J\u0101nis\". Similarly \"&lt;a href=\"M%C4%81rti%C5%86i\"&gt;M\u0101rti\u0146i&lt;/a&gt;\" on November 10 coincides with the name day for males named \"M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161\", \"M\u0101rcis\" and \"Markuss\".\nMost common Latvian names.\nBelow are the most common ethnic Latvian names in 2006. However taking into account the large Eastern Slavic diaspora (&lt;a href=\"Russians%20in%20Latvia\"&gt;Russians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ukrainians%20in%20Latvia\"&gt;Ukrainians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belarusians%20in%20Latvia\"&gt;Belarusians&lt;/a&gt;) that make up around one third of &lt;a href=\"Demographics%20of%20Latvia%23Ethnic%20groups\"&gt;Latvia's population&lt;/a&gt;, names popular among the Slavic population make it high on this list, for example, the most popular male name in Russia \"&lt;a href=\"Aleksandr\"&gt;Aleksandr&lt;/a&gt;\" (or \"&lt;a href=\"Aleksandrs\"&gt;Aleksandrs&lt;/a&gt;\" in its Latvian rendition) makes it as the second most common name in Latvia if all ethnicities are counted."
