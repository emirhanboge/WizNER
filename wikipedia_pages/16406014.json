    "text": "The Robba Fountain (), since the first half of the 20th century also known as the Fountain of the Three Carniolan Rivers (), is the fountain that stands in front of &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Ljubljana Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Town%20Square%20%28Ljubljana%29\"&gt;Town Square&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana\"&gt;Ljubljana&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally made in 1751 by the Italian sculptor &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Robba\"&gt;Francesco Robba&lt;/a&gt; and is one of the city's most recognisable symbols.\nHistory.\nThe fountain was commissioned to Francesco Robba in 1743, but was unveiled only in 1751. In its creation, Robba was inspired by &lt;a href=\"Bernini\"&gt;Bernini&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Fontana%20dei%20Quattro%20Fiumi\"&gt;Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi&lt;/a&gt;\" (Fountain of the Four Rivers) at &lt;a href=\"Piazza%20Navona\"&gt;Piazza Navona&lt;/a&gt; during a visit to &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, but he modelled it after \"&lt;a href=\"Fontana%20del%20Pantheon\"&gt;Fontana del Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;\", the fountain by &lt;a href=\"Filippo%20Barigioni\"&gt;Filippo Barigioni&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Piazza%20della%20Rotonda\"&gt;Piazza della Rotonda&lt;/a&gt;. In 2006, the original fountain was renovated and moved into the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;National Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, whereas at Town Square it has been replaced by a replica.\nDescription.\nThe fountain consists of three male figures with jugs, which came several years after the fountain's creation to supposedly represent the gods of the three rivers of &lt;a href=\"Carniola\"&gt;Carniola&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Ljubljanica\"&gt;Ljubljanica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sava\"&gt;Sava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krka%20%28Sava%29\"&gt;Krka&lt;/a&gt;, and later as well the three territorial units of Carniola: &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Carniola\"&gt;Upper Carniola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Carniola\"&gt;Lower Carniola&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Carniola\"&gt;Inner Carniola&lt;/a&gt;. Steps that lead up to the fountain represent the Carniolan mountains. The water pool has a shape of a shell. In the center of the fountain stands a &lt;a href=\"obelisk\"&gt;obelisk&lt;/a&gt;. The sculptural part of the fountain is made of &lt;a href=\"Carrara%20marble\"&gt;Carrara marble&lt;/a&gt;, the obelisk is made of the local Lesno Brdo marble and the pool is made of local Podpe\u010d limestone.\nCultural significance.\nAfter Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia, the Robba Fountain was portrayed by &lt;a href=\"Rudi%20%C5%A0panzel\"&gt;Rudi \u0160panzel&lt;/a&gt; on the 5,000 &lt;a href=\"Slovenian%20tolar\"&gt;Slovenian tolar&lt;/a&gt; banknote. It was in circulation from December 1993 until the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; in January 2007. Since 2001, the fountain has been protected as a &lt;a href=\"cultural%20monument%20of%20national%20significance\"&gt;cultural monument of national significance&lt;/a&gt;."
