    "text": "Malm\u00f6 Idrottsplats (\"Malm\u00f6 sports field\"), commonly referred to simply as Malm\u00f6 IP and sometimes as Gamla IP (\"The old sports field\"), is a stadium in &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6\"&gt;Malm\u00f6&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden, that is primarily used for association football. As of 2015, it is the home of women's &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"FC%20Roseng%C3%A5rd\"&gt;FC Roseng\u00e5rd&lt;/a&gt;, currently playing in &lt;a href=\"Damallsvenskan\"&gt;Damallsvenskan&lt;/a&gt;; the men's clubs &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6%20FF\"&gt;Malm\u00f6 FF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"IFK%20Malm%C3%B6\"&gt;IFK Malm\u00f6&lt;/a&gt; have played there in the past. The stadium is the third largest in Malm\u00f6 behind &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6%20Stadion\"&gt;Malm\u00f6 Stadion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20%28Malm%C3%B6%29\"&gt;Stadion&lt;/a&gt;, the current home grounds of IFK Malm\u00f6 and Malm\u00f6 FF respectively. The &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sweden national football team&lt;/a&gt; has played at Malm\u00f6 IP twice, in 1929 and 1949. The stadium's capacity has changed throughout the years with various redevelopments and renovations; it is today 7,600, but was historically much higher. The record attendance at the ground was set on 1 June 1956 when 22,436 people attended an &lt;a href=\"Allsvenskan\"&gt;Allsvenskan&lt;/a&gt; match between Malm\u00f6 FF and &lt;a href=\"Helsingborgs%20IF\"&gt;Helsingborgs IF&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stadium was built as a &lt;a href=\"Multi-purpose%20stadium\"&gt;multi-purpose sports field&lt;/a&gt; between March and July 1896 with a grand opening on 4 July 1896. IFK Malm\u00f6 took up residence at the ground in 1903, with Malm\u00f6 FF also doing so seven years later; both remained until 1958, when they moved to Malm\u00f6 Stadion, which had just been built for the &lt;a href=\"1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1958 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Extensive redevelopment and restoration was carried out between 1978 and 1980, and in 1999; the two Malm\u00f6 clubs returned following this latter renovation, but Malm\u00f6 FF went back to Malm\u00f6 Stadion after a single season. The laying of &lt;a href=\"artificial%20turf\"&gt;artificial turf&lt;/a&gt; before the 2008 season led IFK to return to Malm\u00f6 Stadion in protest. The stadium is located on the northern side of Malm\u00f6's largest park, &lt;a href=\"Pildammsparken\"&gt;Pildammsparken&lt;/a&gt;, with Malm\u00f6 Stadion and Stadion both to the park's south.\nHistory.\nConstruction and early history (1896\u20131938).\nMalm\u00f6 IP was built in 1896 to host &lt;a href=\"velocipede\"&gt;cycling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gymnastics\"&gt;gymnastics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wrestling\"&gt;wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; events. Cycling competitions had been organised by Malm\u00f6 Velocipedklubb (MVK) since 24 August 1890, at a temporary sports field in &lt;a href=\"R%C3%B6rsj%C3%B6staden\"&gt;R\u00f6rsj\u00f6staden&lt;/a&gt;. This was also the venue for the first &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; match in Malm\u00f6, a &lt;a href=\"exhibition%20game\"&gt;friendly match&lt;/a&gt; on 12 October 1890 featuring &lt;a href=\"Kj%C3%B8benhavns%20Boldklub\"&gt;Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub&lt;/a&gt; of Denmark. The members of MVK were impressed by the new sport and started a football section of their own. After the R\u00f6rsj\u00f6staden field was earmarked for a new housing development in 1893, MVK began to explore the idea of a new ground. The club pitched this to the local municipality, &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6%20Municipality\"&gt;Malm\u00f6 Stad&lt;/a&gt;, which in February 1894 presented plans for a new sports field in the north-east of the city, in what is today &lt;a href=\"Teatern%2C%20Malm%C3%B6\"&gt;Teatern&lt;/a&gt;, a neighbourhood in &lt;a href=\"Innerstaden%2C%20Malm%C3%B6\"&gt;Innerstaden&lt;/a&gt; district. The MVK board consulted its members, then agreed and signed a 15-year lease on the site.\nTo raise funds for the ground's construction and the annual lease payments, an \"&lt;a href=\"aktiebolag\"&gt;aktiebolag&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"limited%20company\"&gt;limited company&lt;/a&gt;) called AB Malm\u00f6 Idrottsplats was formed in March 1896 under the chairmanship of &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Frick\"&gt;Carl Frick&lt;/a&gt;, a locally-born &lt;a href=\"sea%20captain\"&gt;sea captain&lt;/a&gt; and sports enthusiast. The final construction costs for the new ground were 44,000 &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20krona\"&gt;kronor&lt;/a&gt;, roughly 2,930,000 kronor in modern terms. The ground originally spanned ; an oval cycling track surrounded the grass pitch where &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; and other sports were played. Construction began in March 1896 and ended in July the same year.\nMalm\u00f6 IP opened on 4 July 1896 with cycling competitions, accompanied by organised &lt;a href=\"betting\"&gt;betting&lt;/a&gt;. MVK disbanded its cycling section in 1902, five years after Sweden outlawed gambling in 1897; this had caused attendances to plummet. The construction of a large &lt;a href=\"pavilion\"&gt;pavilion&lt;/a&gt; in the centre of the pitch in 1899 made football impossible, contributing to the end of MVK's football section in 1900; the sport had so far failed to win much local popularity in any case. After football became more popular in Malm\u00f6 in the early 1900s, the pavilion was removed in 1905, with a new pitch concurrently laid out. On 18 September 1897, Malm\u00f6 IP hosted a large celebration marking King &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20II%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Oscar II&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Jubilee\"&gt;Silver Jubilee&lt;/a&gt;; over 10,000 people attended. The ground continues to be used on events such as &lt;a href=\"Public%20holidays%20in%20Sweden\"&gt;national holidays&lt;/a&gt; to the present day.\nAthletics overtook football and cycling competitions at Malm\u00f6 IP after MVK's exit and the foundation of &lt;a href=\"IFK%20Malm%C3%B6\"&gt;IFK Malm\u00f6&lt;/a&gt; in April 1899. IFK arranged events such as the &lt;a href=\"100%20metres\"&gt;100 metres&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mile%20run\"&gt;mile run&lt;/a&gt;, early forms of the &lt;a href=\"high%20jump\"&gt;high jump&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pentathlon\"&gt;pentathlon&lt;/a&gt;s involving the &lt;a href=\"long%20jump\"&gt;long jump&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"javelin%20throw\"&gt;javelin throw&lt;/a&gt;, 100 metres, &lt;a href=\"discus%20throw\"&gt;discus throw&lt;/a&gt; and wrestling. &lt;a href=\"Equestrianism\"&gt;Equestrianism&lt;/a&gt; was popular at Malm\u00f6 IP around the turn of the century, and ice skating was held during the Swedish winter months. &lt;a href=\"Gustaf%20V%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Crown Prince Gustaf&lt;/a&gt;, who later became King Gustav V, attended one of IFK's athletics competitions on 7 November 1901, and reportedly enjoyed the experience very much. When he was stationed at Malm\u00f6 three years later during his military education, he regularly returned to the ground to play tennis. played tennis at Malm\u00f6 IP when he was stationed in Malm\u00f6 during his military education in 1904.\nThe most successful and first club dedicated solely to football in these early years was &lt;a href=\"FC%20Roseng%C3%A5rd%20%28men%29\"&gt;Malm\u00f6 BI&lt;/a&gt; (then abbreviated MBI, and now called FC Roseng\u00e5rd after various changes of name), which was founded in 1904 by former MVK players, and based at Malm\u00f6 IP. The ground also became home to IFK Malm\u00f6's football division, which was formed in 1903. A third club, &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6%20FF\"&gt;Malm\u00f6 FF&lt;/a&gt;, took up residence at the stadium following its own foundation on 24 February 1910 by 19 men at the Malm\u00f6 IP restaurant. Several members of IFK Malm\u00f6's athletics division left the club on 26 August 1908 due to differences in opinion regarding its administration; the dissidents formed Malm\u00f6 Allm\u00e4nna Idrottsf\u00f6rening (MAI) two weeks later. Swedish javelin thrower &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Lemming\"&gt;Eric Lemming&lt;/a&gt; set two new world records in the first international competition that MAI hosted on 10\u201311 July 1909.\nFollowing the banning of betting in Sweden, as well as other events such as rainy summers and wet winters, AB Malm\u00f6 Idrottsplats started to have financial difficulties and applied to the municipality for help. The annual lease payments were cancelled in 1899 and replaced with a subsidy of 1,500 kronor a year, conditional on local schoolchildren receiving free access to the pitch for a few hours each day. Stora Hallen (\"The great hall\"), an adjoining building that had served first as a tennis arena, then riding stables, was redeveloped in 1910 into a dance hall and restaurant called Boston Palace. This was done in the hope of increasing the ground's profits as it was struggling financially. The redevelopment was criticised by some who contended that dancing was an immoral pastime with nothing to do with sport. The financial difficulties continued into the 1910s and the city was forced to raise the yearly grant for Malm\u00f6 IP. IFK Malm\u00f6 and Malm\u00f6 FF, the city's main association football clubs, by this time regularly played home games at the ground. When Malm\u00f6 hosted the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Exhibition\"&gt;Baltic Exhibition&lt;/a&gt; in 1914, Malm\u00f6 IP hosted relevant sporting events during June and July. The exhibition forced the municipality to rearrange the area surrounding the sports field and the surrounding road network was redrawn. Malm\u00f6 IP was given a large compensation for this as the sports field area was affected by the changes.\nThe sports field surpassed into municipal ownership in 1938 when AB Malm\u00f6 Idrottsplats's financial difficulties became too great to bear. There was also widespread criticism from minor sport clubs in Malm\u00f6 against the company's tendency to favour the bigger clubs such as IFK Malm\u00f6, Malm\u00f6 FF and athletics club &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6%20Allm%C3%A4nna%20Idrottsf%C3%B6rening\"&gt;MAI&lt;/a&gt;. Malm\u00f6 Stad therefore voted to nationalise the ownership of both Malm\u00f6 IP and other sport fields in the city in 1935, the motion passed with a small margin, 25 voted for nationalization and 23 voted for continued private ownership. Lengthy negotiations between AB Malm\u00f6 Idrottsplats and the municipality's sports committee began in 1935 and ended in 1937 with a settlement of 160,000 kronor, roughly 4,600,000 kronor in modern terms. The municipality formally took over Malm\u00f6 IP on 1 January 1938.\nMunicipal ownership; plans for a new stadium (1938\u201358).\nAssociation football and athletic clubs continued to share Malm\u00f6 IP after the municipal takeover. The events that attracted the biggest crowd in the 1930s and the 1940s were Malm\u00f6 FF's home matches in Allsvenskan, which could attract capacity crowds of 14,000 spectators. After the capacity was increased, the record for attendance was broken again in 1939 when MAI hosted a competition honouring 25 years since the 1914 Baltic Exhibition in Malm\u00f6; over 25,000 people attended over two days. MAI also hosted other international competitions that brought large crowds to the sports field, including \"Amerikagalorna\" (The America galas), which involved visiting athletes from the United States and Swedish sportsmen and women.\nMalm\u00f6 IP's future came into official discussion first in 1933 with the proposed building of the &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6%20Opera%20and%20Music%20Theatre\"&gt;Malm\u00f6 Opera and Music Theatre&lt;/a&gt;; the original plans called for Malm\u00f6 IP and the surrounding area to be completely demolished. The theatre was ultimately built on the edge of the stadium grounds, and only some nearby structures had to be destroyed\u2014however, these included the building in which Malm\u00f6 FF had been founded in 1910. The ground's main entrance was moved from the north to the east, where it remains to this day. A commemorative table was placed at the exact site of Malm\u00f6 FF's founding in 2010 as part of the club's centenary celebrations, in what is today the theatre's parking lot.\nMalm\u00f6 was one of the most successful sporting cities in Sweden during the 1940s and 1950s; its clubs won national championships in several sports. Malm\u00f6 FF won their first &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Swedish%20football%20champions\"&gt;football championship&lt;/a&gt; at Malm\u00f6 IP during the &lt;a href=\"1943%E2%80%9344%20Allsvenskan\"&gt;1943\u201344 Allsvenskan&lt;/a&gt; season, and over the next decade and a half added another four league titles and five &lt;a href=\"Svenska%20Cupen\"&gt;Svenska Cupen&lt;/a&gt; (Swedish Cup) wins. MAI, wrestling clubs Sparta and Enighet, IFK Malm\u00f6's &lt;a href=\"team%20handball\"&gt;handball&lt;/a&gt; division and others also won Swedish championships during this time. Several major European football clubs visited Malm\u00f6 IP in the years following the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; to play friendlies against Malm\u00f6 FF; these included &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;A.C. Milan&lt;/a&gt; of Italy and &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Birmingham City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Charlton Athletic&lt;/a&gt; from England. These matches caused new attendance records to be set several times.\nMalm\u00f6 was affected by World War II more than most of Sweden, &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;which was neutral&lt;/a&gt;, because of the city's close proximity to &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;German-occupied Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, with the Danish capital &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; just opposite Malm\u00f6 on the other side of the &lt;a href=\"%C3%98resund\"&gt;\u00d8resund&lt;/a&gt;. During these years many public celebrations and events of national unification were celebrated at Malm\u00f6 IP such as the &lt;a href=\"National%20Day%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;National Day of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; on 6 June 1941, when &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Per%20Albin%20Hansson\"&gt;Per Albin Hansson&lt;/a&gt;, who was born in Malm\u00f6, gave a speech. Wartime athletics competitions for military recruits were also held; events included the throwing of &lt;a href=\"grenade\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt;s. Athletics continued to draw large crowds to Malm\u00f6 IP during the 1940s, when &lt;a href=\"Gunder%20H%C3%A4gg\"&gt;Gunder H\u00e4gg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arne%20Andersson\"&gt;Arne Andersson&lt;/a&gt; battled at the running tracks. The &lt;a href=\"World%20records%20in%20athletics\"&gt;world record&lt;/a&gt; for the mile run was beaten twice at the stadium\u2014first by Andersson on 18 July 1944, and then almost exactly a year later 17 July 1945 by H\u00e4gg.\nBy the 1950s it had become clear to the local authorities that Malm\u00f6's interest for football and other sports was becoming too big for Malm\u00f6 IP to accommodate. Malm\u00f6 FF in particular had high average attendances year on year, and matches were often sold out. Apart from the issue of growing popularity, the large crowds raised security issues that became apparent in the &lt;a href=\"Scanian%20derbies\"&gt;Scanian derby&lt;/a&gt; game between Malm\u00f6 FF and Helsingborgs IF in 1951\u2014amid considerable commotion in the stands some people were pushed against poles and fences, but nobody was seriously injured. Plans for a new stadium were first drawn up in 1943, when local officials deemed Malm\u00f6 IP to be too small for major events, but council members differed on where to build the new stadium. The matter was dropped until 1954, when Sweden was chosen to host the &lt;a href=\"1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1958 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, with matches to take place in Malm\u00f6. The new ground's location was a central issue in the discussion: some suggested a suburban location in &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4gersro\"&gt;J\u00e4gersro&lt;/a&gt;, to the city's south-east, while others called for a stadium in central Malm\u00f6, near the city's main park, &lt;a href=\"Pildammsparken\"&gt;Pildammsparken&lt;/a&gt;. Proponents of a central location ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954. &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6%20Stadion\"&gt;Malm\u00f6 Stadion&lt;/a&gt; was built on the southern side of Pildammsparken, opposite from the northern site occupied by Malm\u00f6 IP. Malm\u00f6 FF and IFK Malm\u00f6 both moved to Malm\u00f6 Stadion on its completion in 1958.\nReduced prominence; threatened demolition and first renovation (1958\u20131995).\nThe departure of Malm\u00f6 FF and IFK to Malm\u00f6 Stadion caused Malm\u00f6 IP, which had been the centre of sport in the city since 1896, to lose much of its prominence. MAI also relocated much of its operations to the new Stadion, though it still used Malm\u00f6 IP for training and some national competitions. All international events were moved to Malm\u00f6 Stadion. The last major athletics tournament at Malm\u00f6 IP was held in May 1970. Participants included &lt;a href=\"Ricky%20Bruch\"&gt;Ricky Bruch&lt;/a&gt;, a champion discus thrower who went on to represent Sweden in the &lt;a href=\"1972%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1976%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1976&lt;/a&gt; Summer Olympics. MAI left Malm\u00f6 IP altogether in 1971 for the &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A4sthagen%2C%20Malm%C3%B6\"&gt;H\u00e4sthagen&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhood, where a new sports field had opened.\nDespite the exit of Malm\u00f6 FF and IFK Malm\u00f6, Malm\u00f6 IP continued to host less football, albeit in a less prominent capacity. The two major clubs continued to use the ground for friendlies and pre-season fixtures. Less prominent clubs such as &lt;a href=\"FC%20Roseng%C3%A5rd%20%28men%29\"&gt;Malm\u00f6 BI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilla%20Torg%20FF\"&gt;IF Allians&lt;/a&gt; played at the stadium in lower divisions, mainly in the third and fourth tiers of Swedish football. Malm\u00f6 BI moved to the &lt;a href=\"Roseng%C3%A5rd\"&gt;Roseng\u00e5rd&lt;/a&gt; area in 1973, and IF Allians later moved to &lt;a href=\"Kronprinsen\"&gt;Kronprinsen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ice%20hockey\"&gt;Ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6%20Redhawks\"&gt;Malm\u00f6 FF Ishockey&lt;/a&gt;, who had played on a &lt;a href=\"Ice%20hockey%20rink\"&gt;rink&lt;/a&gt; at Malm\u00f6 IP since their founding in 1947, moved to the new &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6%20Isstadion\"&gt;Malm\u00f6 Isstadion&lt;/a&gt; in 1970. Hockey games at Malm\u00f6 IP during the 1960s attracted crowds of around 2,500. Team handball, which had been played at the tennis hall across the road from the main ground from the 1930s, endured until 1964, when the handball divisions of Malm\u00f6 BI, IFK Malm\u00f6 and Malm\u00f6 FF moved to the new Baltiska hallen at &lt;a href=\"Stadionomr%C3%A5det%2C%20Malm%C3%B6\"&gt;Stadionomr\u00e5det&lt;/a&gt;, near Malm\u00f6 Stadion.\nOn 26 October 1961 Malm\u00f6 Stad announced that Malm\u00f6 IP would be demolished to make room for a new &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20local%20government\"&gt;city hall&lt;/a&gt;. The initial plans earmarked the entire ground for demolition, but the negotiations and bureaucratic procedure dragged on for over a decade. The ground and its facilities deteriorated over this time, leading many of its tenants to move elsewhere. The municipality eventually dismissed the demolition plans and decided in July 1975 to renovate the stadium instead. Planning for this was concluded in 1978, and two years later the work was completed. Apart from the Northern Stand, dating back to the 1920s, all of Malm\u00f6 IP's stands, buildings and facilities were destroyed; new dressing rooms and running tracks were built, but new stands were not. Malm\u00f6 IP became a centre for the city's minor sports teams, hosting school tournaments, amateur football and sports such as &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond renovation and modern history (since 1995).\nIn early 1995, largely on the initiative of Malm\u00f6 FF's vice-chairman &lt;a href=\"Bengt%20Madsen\"&gt;Bengt Madsen&lt;/a&gt;, Malm\u00f6 FF and IFK Malm\u00f6 created a joint project group regarding the future of Malm\u00f6 IP. This body decided to completely renovate Malm\u00f6 IP for a second time, constructing new stands and removing the running tracks to create a stadium exclusively for football. This decision was the result of both clubs' declining attendances during the 1990s\u2014Malm\u00f6 FF were averaging crowds of less than 5,000 at Malm\u00f6 Stadion, while IFK were attracting less than 1,000 by 1999. Malm\u00f6 Stadion's capacity of 27,500 was therefore far too much for both sides. When Malm\u00f6 IP formally reopened on 1 August 1999, both Malm\u00f6 FF and IFK moved back, but Malm\u00f6 FF officials soon decided that the refurbished ground was too small and lacked the safety facilities Malm\u00f6 Stadion offered. After only a few months, following Malm\u00f6 FF's relegation from the Swedish top flight at the end of the 1999 season, the club moved back to Malm\u00f6 Stadion. IFK Malm\u00f6 remained at Malm\u00f6 IP until 2008, when they also moved back to Malm\u00f6 Stadion in protest at the decision to lay &lt;a href=\"artificial%20turf\"&gt;artificial turf&lt;/a&gt; at Malm\u00f6 IP instead of grass.\nMalm\u00f6 FF frequently use Malm\u00f6 IP for pre-season friendlies, since the artificial turf makes it possible to play during the Swedish winter months. Since Malm\u00f6 FF's centenary in 2010, the club has maintained a tradition of playing a friendly at Malm\u00f6 IP each year on 24 February, the anniversary of the club's foundation.\nIn 2006, the women's association football club Malm\u00f6 FF Dam started to use the ground regularly for games in &lt;a href=\"Damallsvenskan\"&gt;Damallsvenskan&lt;/a&gt;, the top level of Swedish women's football. The club has since been renamed twice and has been called &lt;a href=\"FC%20Roseng%C3%A5rd\"&gt;FC Roseng\u00e5rd&lt;/a&gt; since 2013.\nStructure and facilities.\nMalm\u00f6 IP has an overall capacity of 7,600 spectators, of which 3,900 are seated. It comprises five larger stands and one smaller stand. The main stand is the Southern Stand, which is all-seated and located along one of the long sides of the pitch. The Western and Eastern Stands, at opposite ends of the ground behind the two goals, are respectively &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;terraced&lt;/a&gt; and seated. Opposite the Southern Stand are three inconsistent structures\u2014from west to east, a stand with terracing, another with seats and a small standing area with a canopy. The dugouts, changing rooms and referees' facilities are located in the Southern Stand, which also features a small cafeteria. A sports hall called Tennishallen (\"The tennis hall\"), across the road from the Eastern Stand, is also considered part of the stadium.\nThe stadium's structure and facilities have gone through many changes since it first opened in 1896. The ground originally comprised a football pitch surrounded by an oval cycling track; a main stand was on the pitch's southern side, with a smaller stand opposite. Both stands were terraced. A larger stand, built on the northern side of the pitch in the early 1920s, is still in use, and is considered a landmark building by the city municipality\u2014modifications to it are therefore illegal. A larger, improved Southern Stand was built in 1931, the same year of the tennis hall's construction. The tennis hall was built as part of the same plot, but it now stands on the other side of a road that was built through the grounds in 1945. The Northern Stand originally had a restaurant behind it and a large hall next to it, but these were knocked down in 1944 to make room for the Malm\u00f6 Opera and Music Theatre.\nWhen Malm\u00f6 IP was renovated during the 1990s, the old running tracks were removed and new stands were built close to the pitch. The only major change since 1999 has been the change from a natural grass pitch to artificial turf in 2008. In late 2013 the artificial turf was relaid to meet new regulations and standards\u2014the new pitch includes an under-soil heating system to allow use in all weather conditions.\nInternational football.\nMalm\u00f6 IP has hosted two &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; international matches: one friendly and one match in the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;Nordic Football Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecords.\nThe record for highest attendance at Malm\u00f6 IP was set on 1 June 1956, when 22,436 spectators saw the &lt;a href=\"Allsvenskan\"&gt;Allsvenskan&lt;/a&gt; match between Malm\u00f6 FF and &lt;a href=\"Helsingborgs%20IF\"&gt;Helsingborgs IF&lt;/a&gt;. Helsingborgs won 3\u20130. Malm\u00f6 FF's first league game at the stadium was a &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20football%20Division%202\"&gt;Division 2&lt;/a&gt; game against &lt;a href=\"IS%20Halmia\"&gt;IS Halmia&lt;/a&gt; on 2 May 1920; Malm\u00f6 FF won 3\u20130 in front of 1,277 fans.\nAverage attendances during Malm\u00f6 FF's first seasons at the ground were below 1,000 people, except for the 1922 season when Malm\u00f6 FF played in &lt;a href=\"Svenska%20Serien\"&gt;Svenska Serien&lt;/a&gt;, then the unofficial top flight. Apart from 1922, Malm\u00f6 FF played in the second tier of Swedish football until the &lt;a href=\"1931%E2%80%9332%20Allsvenskan\"&gt;1931\u201332&lt;/a&gt; season, when they entered Allsvenskan for the first time. Attendances rose sharply to an average of around 7,000 per game. Gates continued to increase year on year until they peaked during the &lt;a href=\"1949%E2%80%9350%20Allsvenskan\"&gt;1949\u201350&lt;/a&gt; season, when Malm\u00f6 FF completed the league season unbeaten\u2014an average of 17,290 people attended the club's home games. As of 2015, this is the third highest average attendance in Malm\u00f6 FF's history. Attendances varied for Malm\u00f6 FF's final seasons at the stadium in the 1950s, around an average of about 15,000 spectators. The club's last league game at the stadium except for 1999, on 15 May 1958 against &lt;a href=\"IFK%20Eskilstuna\"&gt;IFK Eskilstuna&lt;/a&gt;, attracted 10,013 spectators.\nTransportation.\nMalm\u00f6 IP is served by Malm\u00f6 bus lines 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8, all of which stop at &lt;a href=\"Triangeln%20railway%20station\"&gt;Triangeln railway station&lt;/a&gt;, which opened in December 2010 as part of &lt;a href=\"Citytunneln\"&gt;Citytunneln&lt;/a&gt;. The station is served by &lt;a href=\"Sk%C3%A5ne%20commuter%20rail\"&gt;P\u00e5gat\u00e5g&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oresundtrain\"&gt;\u00d6resund Trains&lt;/a&gt;, and is reachable non-stop from many parts of the &lt;a href=\"%C3%96resund%20Region\"&gt;\u00d6resund Region&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe closest parking location to Malm\u00f6 IP is \"P-huset Malm\u00f6 IP\", a garage with 419 parking spaces next to the stadium. There are also several parking spaces on the ground's southern side, opposite Malm\u00f6 Opera and Music Theatre. Apart from these two parking areas, there are various other residential parking spaces, and a large number of bicycle stands nearby.\nMalm\u00f6 IP is about 15\u201320 minutes' walking distance from Malm\u00f6 Stadion and &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20%28Malm%C3%B6%29\"&gt;Stadion&lt;/a&gt;, on the other side of &lt;a href=\"Pildammsparken\"&gt;Pildammsparken&lt;/a&gt;."
