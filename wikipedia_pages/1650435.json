    "text": "The broad-tailed hummingbird (\"Selasphorus platycercus\") is a medium-sized &lt;a href=\"hummingbird\"&gt;hummingbird&lt;/a&gt; species found in &lt;a href=\"highland\"&gt;highland&lt;/a&gt; regions from western &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Canada\"&gt;Western Canada&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nMedium in size, the broad-tailed hummingbird is in length and possesses an overall &lt;a href=\"wingspan\"&gt;wingspan&lt;/a&gt; of . Weighing around , the female tends to be slightly larger than the male. Adults of both sexes show an &lt;a href=\"Iridescence\"&gt;iridescent&lt;/a&gt; green back, white &lt;a href=\"Eye-ring\"&gt;eye ring&lt;/a&gt; and a rounded black tail projecting beyond their wing tips, from which their name was inspired. \nThis species shows &lt;a href=\"sexual%20dimorphism\"&gt;sexual dimorphism&lt;/a&gt;, which means that male and female have different characteristics. The male possesses a characteristic bright rose-red &lt;a href=\"Gorget%20%28bird%29\"&gt;gorget&lt;/a&gt;. An identification characteristic is the white &lt;a href=\"Eye-ring\"&gt;eye ring&lt;/a&gt;. The female can be distinguished from the male by her paler coloration, cinnamon flanks, and spotted cheeks absent in the male.\nTaxonomy.\nThe broad-tailed hummingbird, \"Selasphorus platycercus,\" is a member of the order &lt;a href=\"Apodiformes\"&gt;Apodiformes&lt;/a&gt;, in the family &lt;a href=\"Hummingbird\"&gt;Trochilidae&lt;/a&gt;\".\" &lt;a href=\"Hummingbird\"&gt;Hummingbird&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taxonomy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; has not been extensively studied, but its &lt;a href=\"Phylogenetics\"&gt;phylogenic&lt;/a&gt; division can be divided as a family into nine &lt;a href=\"Clade\"&gt;clades&lt;/a&gt; in which the broad-tailed hummingbird is a member of the \"Bee group\" and included in the \"&lt;a href=\"Selasphorus\"&gt;Selasphorus&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt;. This genus is composed of 6 members taxonomically distinguished based on color characteristics. This genus is characterized by hummingbirds with a plumage containing rufous coloration and a neck &lt;a href=\"gorget\"&gt;gorget&lt;/a&gt; of orange to purple in males.\nMembers of this &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; include:\n\"Selasphorus sasin\" : &lt;a href=\"Allen%27s%20hummingbird\"&gt;Allen's hummingbird&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Selasphorus rufus\" : &lt;a href=\"Rufous%20hummingbird\"&gt;Rufous hummingbird&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Selasphorus scintilla\" : &lt;a href=\"Scintillant%20hummingbird\"&gt;Scintillant hummingbird&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Selasphorus ardens\" : &lt;a href=\"Glow-throated%20hummingbird\"&gt;Glow-throated hummingbird&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Selasphorus flammula\" :&lt;a href=\"Volcano%20hummingbird\"&gt;Volcano hummingbird&lt;/a&gt;\nOn a geographic scale, the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Selasphorus\"&gt;Selasphorus&lt;/a&gt;\" can be subdivided into 2 groups of &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt;, one living in &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, and a second in the region of &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Panama\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;.\nHabitat and distribution.\nHabitat.\nThis hummingbird is seen in the &lt;a href=\"understory\"&gt;understory&lt;/a&gt; or under tree &lt;a href=\"Canopy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;canopies&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"pine\"&gt;pine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"woodland\"&gt;woodland&lt;/a&gt;. It forages in open areas with flowers or in &lt;a href=\"Grassland\"&gt;grasslands&lt;/a&gt; among trees and shrubs. Its breeding habitat is mainly in &lt;a href=\"subalpine\"&gt;subalpine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Meadow\"&gt;meadows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"foothills\"&gt;foothills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Montane%20ecosystems\"&gt;montane&lt;/a&gt; valleys, and stands of &lt;a href=\"aspen\"&gt;aspen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"spruce\"&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistribution.\nThe broad-tailed hummingbird is found from &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Northwest\"&gt;western United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Canada\"&gt;Western Canada&lt;/a&gt; during summer, while wintering regions are mainly in southern Mexico and Guatemala.\nMigration.\nThis species exhibits partial &lt;a href=\"Migration%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;migration&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the northern range during winter. The specific migratory route used by the broad-tailed hummingbird remains unknown, although migrating populations winter in southern &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt; and return to their breeding area in spring. Males arrive first to the breeding range, followed by breeding females. Some populations of the broad-tailed hummingbird in southern Mexico and Guatemala do not migrate, a variation in behavior called \"sedentary\".\nBehavior.\nVocalizations.\nThe broad-tailed hummingbird produces several different sound patterns. This bird's call sounds like a sharp \u201ccheet\u201d, which is repeated \u201c\"cheet cheet cheet cheet\"...\u201d. Hummingbird wing beats have also been found to be a communication signal. These birds produce two different types of sound using their wing beat. The first one is a \"\u201cwing hum\u201d\" and is simply produced when the hummingbird flies. This type of wing beat has a sound that ranges from 35 to 100 Hz, and both sexes are able to produce it for communication. The second is \"\u201cwing trills\u201d\" produced by the male hummingbird during &lt;a href=\"courtship%20display\"&gt;courtship display&lt;/a&gt;s. The wing trill produces a buzzing sound and can be heard 50 m away by other males and 75 m away by other females. This sound is produced when air passes rapidly through the 9th and 10th &lt;a href=\"Flight%20feather\"&gt;primary feathers&lt;/a&gt;. In one experiment, birds without this wing trill lost their &lt;a href=\"Territory%20%28animal%29\"&gt;territory&lt;/a&gt; more easily to more aggressive birds.\nDiet.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Diet%20%28nutrition%29\"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; of the broad-tailed hummingbirds consists mainly of insects and &lt;a href=\"nectar\"&gt;nectar&lt;/a&gt; of plants that are \u201c&lt;a href=\"Pollination\"&gt;hummingbird-flowered&lt;/a&gt;\u201d. These types of flower are characterized by high &lt;a href=\"nectar\"&gt;nectar&lt;/a&gt; production and red &lt;a href=\"Petal\"&gt;corollas&lt;/a&gt; with a tubular shape, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Aquilegia%20elegantula\"&gt;Aquilegia elegantula&lt;/a&gt;\". \nReproduction.\nThe range of breeding locations appear to be from central &lt;a href=\"Montana\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt; in the north to Guatemala in the south. Although broad-tailed hummingbirds have been seen in &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, these birds appear to be accidental migrants, with no evidence for breeding at such northern latitudes.\nBreeding site.\nThe broad-tailed hummingbird has a &lt;a href=\"Promiscuity\"&gt;promiscuous&lt;/a&gt; mating system and does not form a &lt;a href=\"pair%20bond\"&gt;pair bond&lt;/a&gt;. The reproduction time for broad-tailed hummingbirds correlated with the time flower production is at its peak. \nCourtship.\nMale perform an aerial &lt;a href=\"Display%20%28zoology%29\"&gt;display&lt;/a&gt; to attract females during the breeding season. Males will fly high and dive while producing a trill sound with their wing feathers. \nNest construction.\nIn 70% of cases, females return to their nest site from one year to the next. Females build their nest alone, without the male help. The overall nest construction may take around 4 to 5 days. The nest has an overall cup shape and is stuck to a tree branch with spider webs, camouflaged by the addition of an external layer of &lt;a href=\"lichen\"&gt;lichen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;, and tree material. Nest material can be stolen by other females for the construction of a nest.\nBrooding.\nThe female will lay two white eggs of around in length and incubate them alone for around 16 to 19 days. Nest cup diameter increases as the &lt;a href=\"Chick%20%28bird%29\"&gt;chicks&lt;/a&gt; age. Chicks are &lt;a href=\"Altriciality\"&gt;altricial&lt;/a&gt; at their hatch, and will take around 10 to 12 days for feathering. The female will stay with the &lt;a href=\"Fledge\"&gt;fledged&lt;/a&gt; young up to several weeks.\nConservation status.\nThis species conservation status is \u201cLeast Concern \u201d, indicating it is not an &lt;a href=\"endangered%20species\"&gt;endangered species&lt;/a&gt;, having a wide range and moderate population size, although one survey indicated a 52% decline in population between 1966 and 2015. It appears to be adapted to human-modified habitats."
