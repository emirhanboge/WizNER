It was originally released in 1974, on the label &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Records\"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;. The album wasn't a commercial success and was his last solo album until 1981's &lt;a href=\"Plantation%20Harbor\"&gt;Plantation Harbor&lt;/a&gt; (released 7 years later). After the recording of \"Roller Coaster Weekend\", Vitale would join the &lt;a href=\"Long%20May%20You%20Run\"&gt;Stills-Young band&lt;/a&gt; and tour with &lt;a href=\"Crosby%2C%20Stills%2C%20Nash%20%26amp%3B%20Young\"&gt;Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&lt;/a&gt; line-up, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Eagles%20%28band%29\"&gt;Eagles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe song \"Falling,\" was borrowed in part for &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Walsh\"&gt;Joe Walsh&lt;/a&gt;'s song \"At the Station\", later recorded and released on Walsh's fourth solo album \"&lt;a href=\"But%20Seriously%2C%20Folks...\"&gt;But Seriously, Folks...&lt;/a&gt;\" (1978)\nCritical reception.\nIn a retrospective review by &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; critic Rob Caldwell gave the album a star rating of 2 out of 5 (meaning \"Poor\") and he stated that considering the stalwart guitarists featured on the album it's a \"song-oriented album\" and he also added that the album \"never quite gets off the ground.\"\nPersonnel.\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes."
