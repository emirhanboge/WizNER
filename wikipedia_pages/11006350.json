    "text": "Mount Sugartop () is a prominent, partly snow-covered &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;, 2,325 m, standing 5 miles (8\u00a0km) northwest of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Paget\"&gt;Mount Paget&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Allardyce%20Range\"&gt;Allardyce Range&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"South%20Georgia%20Island\"&gt;South Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. The name \"Sugarloaf Peak\" has appeared on maps for this feature for many years, but the &lt;a href=\"South%20Georgia%20Survey\"&gt;South Georgia Survey&lt;/a&gt;, following its 1951-52 surveying expedition, reported that the name Mount Sugartop is well established locally for this mountain. This latter name is approved on the basis of local usage."
