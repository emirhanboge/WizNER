The inspiration for the design concept comes from an ancient Chinese poem \"The bright moon rises above the sea, bringing us all together at this very moment\".\nThe front of the medal is a circle symbolising the brilliance of the sun and the moon; within the circle is the emblem of the Games and the image of the &lt;a href=\"Tianya%20Haijiao\"&gt;Tianya rock&lt;/a&gt; formation representing the history and culture of Sanya, decorated the rest of the medal and depicts the natural scenery of Sanya \u2013 the sweeping bays, waves and beaches. The back of the medal features the Olympic Council of Asia logo, highlighted by the dragon, falcon and shining sun, and the side of the medal is engraved with the phrase \"Welcome to Tianya Haijiao\" in English.\nVenues.\nTianya District.\nThe four clusters, in the district of &lt;a href=\"Tianya%20District\"&gt;Tianya&lt;/a&gt;, includes ten sports venues. It was home to the Headquarters Hotel and the &lt;a href=\"Sanya%20Phoenix%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Sanya Phoenix International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, a stand-alone sports venue was located in the district of &lt;a href=\"Yazhou%20District\"&gt;Yazhou&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaitang District.\nThe two clusters, in the district of &lt;a href=\"Haitang%20District\"&gt;Haitang&lt;/a&gt;, includes ten sports venues.\nJiyang District.\nA cluster, in the district of &lt;a href=\"Jiyang%20District%2C%20Sanya\"&gt;Jiyang&lt;/a&gt;, includes six sports venues.

The shining sun emblem of the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Council%20of%20Asia\"&gt;OCA&lt;/a&gt; is prominent in the design.\nThe English slogan \u201cSee Ya in Sanya!\u201d is a short, youthful and friendly catchphrase for visitors from all over Asia and beyond. It represents the relaxed and family-oriented concept of the beach and sea sports festival.\nMascot.\nThe mascot of the games is an &lt;a href=\"Eld%27s%20deer\"&gt;Eld's deer&lt;/a&gt; in beach clothing called Yaya (\u4e9a\u4e9a). The first character of the name comes from Sanya (\u4e09\u4e9a), and the second one from \"Yazhou\"(\u4e9a\u6d32), which is the Chinese word for Asia, representing the dynamic, interconnected and inter-dependent relationship among Sanya, Asia and other parts of the world."
