    "text": "Clair Maxwell (1890\u20131957) was a 20th-century American magazine publisher.\nEarly years.\nMaxwell was born in 1890 in &lt;a href=\"South%20Dakota\"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of eight children, including brothers: Lee Maxwell; President of Crowell Publishing Company, Ray G. Maxwell; advertising agent, and Lloyd Maxwell; of Williams &amp; Cunnyngham agency in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore \"Life\".\nMaxwell served in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; as a transport pilot. In 1918 he married Dorothy Boyden, daughter of a Chicago jeweler and a graduate of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. He and Dorothy had three children, Clair Maxwell Jr., Joan Maxwell Alvarez (&lt;a href=\"television%20producer\"&gt;television producer&lt;/a&gt;), and Hope Tate.\n\"Life\" magazine.\nHe was the publisher of &lt;a href=\"Life%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;\"Life\" magazine&lt;/a&gt; (when it was a general interest magazine) from 1921 to 1942. He acquired the magazine on the verge of financial ruin, and brought it back to being profitable after years of modifying its format and editorial style. After selling the business to &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Luce\"&gt;Henry Luce&lt;/a&gt; in 1942 he worked for Luce for a short time before retiring to &lt;a href=\"St.%20Augustine%2C%20Florida\"&gt;St. Augustine, Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter \"Life\".\nMaxwell became a partner in a liquor &lt;a href=\"Distribution%20%28business%29\"&gt;distribution company&lt;/a&gt; serving northern and central &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. He died in September 1957 from a smoking-related disease now known as &lt;a href=\"Chronic%20obstructive%20pulmonary%20disease\"&gt;congestive obstructive pulmonary disorder&lt;/a&gt;.\nGolf.\nMaxwell was an enthusiastic golfer. The \"four Brothers Maxwell\" (Clair/Lee/Ray/Lloyd) had a standing challenge to any other foursome of one family, or any foursome of the publishing business.\nIn 1931 when the &lt;a href=\"USGA\"&gt;USGA&lt;/a&gt; had approved a new tour &lt;a href=\"Golf%20ball\"&gt;ball&lt;/a&gt;, Maxwell had a strong personal opinion of the new ball, which he widely publicized. He called it a \"cross between a ping-pong globule and a Mexican jumping bean\"."
