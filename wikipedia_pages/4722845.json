He joined newly relegated Conference Premier side &lt;a href=\"Wrexham%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Wrexham&lt;/a&gt; in June 2008 on a two-year contract. In November 2008 he joined &lt;a href=\"Rushden%20%26amp%3B%20Diamonds%20F.C.\"&gt;Rushden &amp; Diamonds&lt;/a&gt; on loan until January 2009.

Following the completion of his loan spell at Rushden, he was set to join &lt;a href=\"York%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;York City&lt;/a&gt; on loan. The move was completed on 15 January, when he signed for the rest of the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2008\u201309&lt;/a&gt; season.

He later joined &lt;a href=\"Eastwood%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Eastwood Town&lt;/a&gt; and made his debut in a 2\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Workington%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Workington&lt;/a&gt;."
