The board design and size may vary depending on the variant played. Perhaps a more common variant is the 10 x 4 hole board. It is unknown how many pieces there are in the game, and whether any of the pieces belong to any of the players. Each player controls two rows of holes. All moves are capturing moves. A capturing move is when one piece jumps across another piece."
