    "text": "The Indonesia Open is the national open &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; championship of Indonesia, and traditionally held in the capital, &lt;a href=\"Jakarta\"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Indonesian Open was founded in 1974 as an event on the &lt;a href=\"Asia%20Golf%20Circuit\"&gt;Asia Golf Circuit&lt;/a&gt;. It remained on the circuit until the end of the 1996 season, after which it joined the rival Asian PGA's &lt;a href=\"Omega%20Tour\"&gt;Omega Tour&lt;/a&gt; for the 1997 season.\nHaving not been held between 1998 and 2004, the Indonesian Open returned in 2005 as a co-sanctioned event on both the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Tour\"&gt;Asian Tour&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"European%20Tour\"&gt;European Tour&lt;/a&gt;. It remained a fixture on the tours through the 2009 season after which it joined the rival &lt;a href=\"OneAsia\"&gt;OneAsia&lt;/a&gt; tour. In 2012 it was the opening event of that tour's calendar and was also an unofficial event on the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Golf%20Tour\"&gt;Japan Golf Tour&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, it returned to the Asian Tour and moved from March to late November/early December.\nIn 2005, &lt;a href=\"Thaworn%20Wiratchant\"&gt;Thaworn Wiratchant&lt;/a&gt; recorded what would have been the record lowest aggregate score on the European Tour with 255 strokes. However, this record is not considered official as preferred lies were in operation throughout the week."
