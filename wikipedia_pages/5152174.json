    "text": "Marijan Buljat (born 12 September 1981, in &lt;a href=\"Zadar\"&gt;Zadar&lt;/a&gt;) is a &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player who plays as a &lt;a href=\"wingback%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;wingback&lt;/a&gt;. His current club is NK Arbanasi Zadar.\nBorn in Zadar and a product of the &lt;a href=\"NK%20Zadar\"&gt;NK Zadar&lt;/a&gt; academy, Buljat moved soon after finishing his youth career to &lt;a href=\"NK%20Rijeka\"&gt;NK Rijeka&lt;/a&gt;. After a year and a half there he moved in January 2002 to the &lt;a href=\"2.%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga\"&gt;2. Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth\"&gt;Greuther F\u00fcrth&lt;/a&gt;, signing a 2.5-year contract. After featuring in only a few friendlies for the first side and playing mostly for the Greuther F\u00fcrth amateur team in the &lt;a href=\"Oberliga%20Bayern\"&gt;Oberliga Bayern&lt;/a&gt;, he moved in January 2003 back to Croatia, to &lt;a href=\"NK%20Osijek\"&gt;NK Osijek&lt;/a&gt;. After another one and half there, he was signed, in summer 2004, by &lt;a href=\"Dinamo%20Zagreb\"&gt;Dinamo Zagreb&lt;/a&gt;. He has played since for the &lt;a href=\"Croatia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Croatian national team&lt;/a&gt;, being a backup player for the squad in &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; as well. In January 2007 Buljat's left leg was broken by the Croatia national team striker &lt;a href=\"Eduardo\"&gt;Eduardo&lt;/a&gt; in training. In a cruel twist of irony Eduardo's own leg was broken by a tackle by &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Birmingham City's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201979%29\"&gt;Martin Taylor&lt;/a&gt; in 2008. In July 2008 he was reported that he was transferred to biggest Dinamo rival &lt;a href=\"Hajduk%20Split\"&gt;Hajduk Split&lt;/a&gt; on a free transfer, signing a four-year contract. After securing a first eleven spot in the 2008/2009 season, he was removed from the first team squad in late 2009 for refusing to sign a new contract with a wage cut. A new contract was signed 6 months later, and was set to feature in the first team again, but broke his right leg in training in July 2010, after featuring only in a single league match. He returned to play in 2011, after a 10-month recovery."
