The Singapore Cruise Centre Pte Ltd took over management of the centre on 1 April 2003 when PSA Corporation divested its non-core businesses.\nAdditional, SCC manages 2 other ferry terminals; Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal (TMFT) and Pasir Panjang Ferry Terminal (PPFT). In total, SCC handles a throughput of over 7 million cruise and ferry passengers a year, of which about 950,000 are cruise passengers.\nIn 2013, &lt;a href=\"SATS%20Ltd\"&gt;SATS&lt;/a&gt; planned to buy over SCC for S$110 million. The acquisition terminated in 2014.\nIn 2016, fully owned subsidiary SCC Travel Services Pte Ltd (STS) was formed to inspire travel to the destinations connected to its terminal network. STS is a B2C online travel agent retailing travel products from Bintan, Batam, Karimun and Singapore through its portal WOW Getaways.\nFacilities.\nThe regional terminal at HarbourFront has six berths for ferries to various ports on the island of &lt;a href=\"Batam\"&gt;Batam&lt;/a&gt;, Indonesia, as well as &lt;a href=\"Tanjung%20Balai%20Karimun\"&gt;Tanjung Balai&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Karimun%20Islands\"&gt;Karimun Islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe terminal at Tanah Merah has four berths for ferries to the island of &lt;a href=\"Bintan\"&gt;Bintan&lt;/a&gt;, Indonesia, and the secondary &lt;a href=\"Batam\"&gt;Batam&lt;/a&gt; port of Nongsapura.\nThe terminal at Pasir Panjang has 4 berths for ferries that give passage to Singapore's industrial islands of &lt;a href=\"Pulau%20Bukom\"&gt;Bukom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pulau%20Semakau\"&gt;Semakau&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe IPT handles international &lt;a href=\"cruise%20ship\"&gt;cruise ship&lt;/a&gt;s, and has two berths of 310 metres and 270 metres with a height limit of 52 metres. It has a draft of 12 metres. It underwent an upgrade in 2005 to improve its passenger handling facilities.\nExpansion.\nThe existing terminals at HarbourFront were renovated in 2008 to optimize the use of available space. The entire level 2 is a restricted area, for the exclusive use of cruise and &lt;a href=\"ferry\"&gt;ferry&lt;/a&gt; passengers who have cleared immigration and security. Within this area, there are new and more exciting retail and F&amp;B outlets. There are ample seats within this restricted area and features to please the five senses (i.e. calming water, music, greenery/landscape, cooler airflow etc.) for greater passenger comfort. The re-configuration enabled a smoother processes and passengers have a more stress-free and seamless travel."
