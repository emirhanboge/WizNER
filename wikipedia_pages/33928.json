    "text": "West Side Story is a &lt;a href=\"Musical%20theatre\"&gt;musical&lt;/a&gt; conceived by &lt;a href=\"Jerome%20Robbins\"&gt;Jerome Robbins&lt;/a&gt; with music by &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Bernstein\"&gt;Leonard Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;, lyrics by &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Sondheim\"&gt;Stephen Sondheim&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Book%20%28musical%20theatre%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Laurents\"&gt;Arthur Laurents&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspired by &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;'s play \"&lt;a href=\"Romeo%20and%20Juliet\"&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/a&gt;\", the story is set in the mid-1950s in the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20West%20Side\"&gt;Upper West Side&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, then a &lt;a href=\"multiracial\"&gt;multiracial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blue-collar\"&gt;blue-collar&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood. The musical explores the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, two teenage street &lt;a href=\"gang\"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt;s of different &lt;a href=\"ethnicity\"&gt;ethnic&lt;/a&gt; backgrounds. The members of the Sharks, &lt;a href=\"Stateside%20Puerto%20Ricans\"&gt;from Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, are taunted by the Jets, a &lt;a href=\"White%20Americans\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; gang. The young protagonist, Tony, a former member of the Jets and best friend of the gang's leader, Riff, falls in love with Maria, the sister of Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks. The dark theme, sophisticated music, extended dance scenes, and focus on social problems marked a turning point in musical theatre.\nThe original 1957 &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20theatre\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; production, directed and choreographed by Robbins, marked Sondheim's Broadway debut. It ran for 732 performances before going on tour. The production was nominated for six &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Awards\"&gt;Tony Awards&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Musical\"&gt;Best Musical&lt;/a&gt;, in 1958, winning two. The show had an even longer-running &lt;a href=\"West%20End%20theatre\"&gt;West End&lt;/a&gt; production, a number of revivals, and international productions. A &lt;a href=\"West%20Side%20Story%20%281961%20film%29\"&gt;1961 musical film adaptation&lt;/a&gt;, co-directed by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Wise\"&gt;Robert Wise&lt;/a&gt; and Robbins, starred &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Wood\"&gt;Natalie Wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Beymer\"&gt;Richard Beymer&lt;/a&gt;. The film was nominated for eleven &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Awards\"&gt;Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt; and won ten, including &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture\"&gt;Best Picture&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"West%20Side%20Story%20%282021%20film%29\"&gt;2021 film adaptation&lt;/a&gt;, directed by &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Spielberg\"&gt;Steven Spielberg&lt;/a&gt;, starred &lt;a href=\"Ansel%20Elgort\"&gt;Ansel Elgort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rachel%20Zegler\"&gt;Rachel Zegler&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nGenesis.\nIn 1949, Jerome Robbins approached Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Laurents about collaborating on a contemporary musical adaptation of \"Romeo and Juliet\". He proposed that the plot focus on the conflict between an Irish Catholic family and a Jewish family living on the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20East%20Side\"&gt;Lower East Side&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, during the Easter\u2013&lt;a href=\"Passover\"&gt;Passover&lt;/a&gt; season. The girl has survived the &lt;a href=\"Holocaust\"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; and emigrated from Israel; the conflict was to be centered on &lt;a href=\"anti-Semitism\"&gt;anti-Semitism&lt;/a&gt; of the Catholic \"Jets\" towards the Jewish \"Emeralds\" (a name that made its way into the script as a reference). Eager to write his first musical, Laurents immediately agreed. Bernstein wanted to present the material in operatic form, but Robbins and Laurents resisted the suggestion. They described the project as \"lyric theater\", and Laurents wrote a first draft he called \"East Side Story\". Only after he completed it did the group realize it was little more than a musicalization of themes that had already been covered in plays like \"&lt;a href=\"Abie%27s%20Irish%20Rose\"&gt;Abie's Irish Rose&lt;/a&gt;\". When Robbins opted to drop out, the three men went their separate ways, and the piece was shelved for almost five years.\nIn 1955, theatrical producer &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Gabel\"&gt;Martin Gabel&lt;/a&gt; was working on a stage adaptation of the &lt;a href=\"James%20M.%20Cain\"&gt;James M. Cain&lt;/a&gt; novel \"Serenade\", about an opera singer who comes to the realization he is homosexual, and he invited Laurents to write the book. Laurents accepted and suggested Bernstein and Robbins join the creative team. Robbins felt if the three were going to join forces, they should return to \"East Side Story\", and Bernstein agreed. Laurents, however, was committed to Gabel, who introduced him to the young composer/lyricist &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Sondheim\"&gt;Stephen Sondheim&lt;/a&gt;. Sondheim auditioned by playing the score for \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20%28musical%29\"&gt;Saturday Night&lt;/a&gt;\", his musical that was scheduled to open in the fall. Laurents liked the lyrics but was not impressed with the music. Sondheim did not care for Laurents' opinion. \"Serenade\" ultimately was shelved.\nLaurents was soon hired to write the screenplay for a &lt;a href=\"remake\"&gt;remake&lt;/a&gt; of the 1934 &lt;a href=\"Greta%20Garbo\"&gt;Greta Garbo&lt;/a&gt; film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Painted%20Veil%20%281934%20film%29\"&gt;The Painted Veil&lt;/a&gt;\" for &lt;a href=\"Ava%20Gardner\"&gt;Ava Gardner&lt;/a&gt;. While in Hollywood, he contacted Bernstein, who was in town conducting at the &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Bowl\"&gt;Hollywood Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. The two met at &lt;a href=\"The%20Beverly%20Hills%20Hotel\"&gt;The Beverly Hills Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, and the conversation turned to &lt;a href=\"Juvenile%20delinquency\"&gt;juvenile delinquent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gang\"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt;s, a fairly recent social phenomenon that had received major coverage on the front pages of the morning newspapers due to a &lt;a href=\"Chicano\"&gt;Chicano&lt;/a&gt; turf war. Bernstein suggested they rework \"East Side Story\" and set it in Los Angeles, but Laurents felt he was more familiar with &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Ricans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Puerto Ricans in the United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harlem\"&gt;Harlem&lt;/a&gt; than he was with &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Americans\"&gt;Mexican Americans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Olvera%20Street\"&gt;Olvera Street&lt;/a&gt;. The two contacted Robbins, who was enthusiastic about a musical with a Latin beat. He arrived in Hollywood to choreograph the dance sequences for the 1956 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20King%20and%20I%20%281956%20film%29\"&gt;The King and I&lt;/a&gt;\", and he and Laurents began developing the musical while working on their respective projects, keeping in touch with Bernstein, who had returned to New York. When the producer of \"The Painted Veil\" replaced Gardner with &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20Parker\"&gt;Eleanor Parker&lt;/a&gt; and asked Laurents to revise his script with her in mind, he backed out of the film, freeing him to devote all his time to the stage musical. Bernstein and Laurents, who had been &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20blacklist\"&gt;blacklisted&lt;/a&gt; for alleged communist activities, worked with Robbins even though he had cooperated with the &lt;a href=\"House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee\"&gt;House Un-American Activities Committee&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollaboration and development.\nIn New York City, Laurents went to the opening night party for a new play by &lt;a href=\"Ugo%20Betti\"&gt;Ugo Betti&lt;/a&gt;. There he met Sondheim, who had heard that \"East Side Story\", now retitled \"West Side Story\", was back on track. Bernstein had decided he needed to concentrate solely on the music, and he and Robbins had invited &lt;a href=\"Betty%20Comden\"&gt;Betty Comden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adolph%20Green\"&gt;Adolph Green&lt;/a&gt; to write the lyrics, but the team opted to work on \"&lt;a href=\"Peter%20Pan%20%281954%20musical%29\"&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/a&gt;\" instead. Laurents asked Sondheim if he would be interested in tackling the task. Initially he resisted, because he was determined to write the full score for his next project (\"Saturday Night\" had been scrapped). But &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Hammerstein%20II\"&gt;Oscar Hammerstein&lt;/a&gt; convinced him that he would benefit from the experience, and he accepted. Meanwhile, Laurents had written a new draft of the book changing the characters' backgrounds: The male lead, once an Irish American, was now of Polish and Irish descent, and the formerly Jewish female lead had become Puerto Rican.\nThe original book Laurents wrote closely adhered to \"Romeo and Juliet\", but the characters based on Shakespeare's &lt;a href=\"Rosaline\"&gt;Rosaline&lt;/a&gt; and the parents of the doomed lovers were eliminated early on. Later the scenes related to Juliet's faking her death and committing suicide also were deleted. Language posed a problem; &lt;a href=\"profanity\"&gt;profanity&lt;/a&gt; was uncommon in the theater at the time, and slang expressions were avoided for fear they would be dated by the time the production opened. Laurents ultimately invented what sounded like real street talk but actually was not: \"cut the frabba-jabba\", for example. Sondheim converted long passages of dialogue, and sometimes just a simple phrase like \"A boy like that would kill your brother\", into lyrics. With the help of Oscar Hammerstein, Laurents convinced Bernstein and Sondheim to move \"One Hand, One Heart\", which he considered too pristine for the balcony scene, to the scene set in the bridal shop, and as a result \"Tonight\" was written to replace it. Laurents felt that the building tension needed to be alleviated in order to increase the impact of the play's tragic outcome, so comic relief in the form of Officer Krupke was added to the second act. He was outvoted on other issues: he felt the lyrics to \"&lt;a href=\"America%20%28West%20Side%20Story%20song%29\"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Feel%20Pretty\"&gt;I Feel Pretty&lt;/a&gt;\" were too witty for the characters singing them, but they stayed in the score and proved to be audience favorites. Another song, \"Kid Stuff\", was added and quickly removed during the Washington, D.C. tryout when Laurents convinced the others it was helping tip the balance of the show into typical musical comedy.\nBernstein composed \"West Side Story\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Candide%20%28operetta%29\"&gt;Candide&lt;/a&gt;\" concurrently, which led to some switches of material between the two works. Tony and Maria's duet, \"One Hand, One Heart\", was originally intended for Cunegonde in \"Candide\". The music of \"&lt;a href=\"Gee%2C%20Officer%20Krupke\"&gt;Gee, Officer Krupke&lt;/a&gt;\" was pulled from the Venice scene in \"Candide\". Laurents explained the style that the creative team finally decided on:\nThe show was nearly complete in the fall of 1956, but almost everyone on the creative team needed to fulfill other commitments first. Robbins was involved with \"&lt;a href=\"Bells%20Are%20Ringing%20%28musical%29\"&gt;Bells Are Ringing&lt;/a&gt;\", then Bernstein with \"&lt;a href=\"Candide%20%28operetta%29\"&gt;Candide&lt;/a&gt;\", and in January 1957 \"A Clearing in the Woods\", Laurents' latest play, opened and quickly closed. When a backers' audition failed to raise any money for \"West Side Story\" late in the spring of 1957, only two months before the show was to begin rehearsals, producer &lt;a href=\"Cheryl%20Crawford\"&gt;Cheryl Crawford&lt;/a&gt; pulled out of the project. Every other producer had already turned down the show, deeming it too dark and depressing. Bernstein was despondent, but Sondheim convinced his friend &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Prince\"&gt;Hal Prince&lt;/a&gt;, who was in Boston overseeing the out-of-town tryout of the new &lt;a href=\"George%20Abbott\"&gt;George Abbott&lt;/a&gt; musical \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Girl%20in%20Town\"&gt;New Girl in Town&lt;/a&gt;\", to read the script. He liked it but decided to ask Abbott, his longtime mentor, for his opinion, and Abbott advised him to turn it down. Prince, aware that Abbott was the primary reason \"New Girl\" was in trouble, decided to ignore him, and he and his producing partner Robert Griffith flew to New York to hear the score. In his memoirs, Prince recalled, \"Sondheim and Bernstein sat at the piano playing through the music, and soon I was singing along with them.\"\nProduction period.\nPrince began cutting the budget and raising money. Robbins then announced he did not want to choreograph the show, but changed his mind when Prince agreed to an eight-week dance rehearsal period (instead of the customary four), since there was to be more dancing in \"West Side Story\" than in any previous Broadway show, and allowed Robbins to hire &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Gennaro\"&gt;Peter Gennaro&lt;/a&gt; as his assistant. Originally, when considering the cast, Laurents wanted &lt;a href=\"James%20Dean\"&gt;James Dean&lt;/a&gt; for the lead role of Tony, but the actor soon died. Sondheim found &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Kert\"&gt;Larry Kert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chita%20Rivera\"&gt;Chita Rivera&lt;/a&gt;, who created the roles of Tony and Anita, respectively. Getting the work on stage was still not easy. Bernstein said:\nThroughout the rehearsal period, the New York newspapers were filled with articles about gang warfare, keeping the show's plot timely. Robbins kept the cast members playing the Sharks and the Jets separate in order to discourage them from socializing with each other and reminded everyone of the reality of gang violence by posting news stories on the bulletin board backstage. Robbins wanted a gritty realism from his sneaker- and jeans-clad cast. He gave the ensemble more freedom than Broadway dancers had previously been given to interpret their roles, and the dancers were thrilled to be treated like actors instead of just choreographed bodies. As the rehearsals wore on, Bernstein fought to keep his score together, as other members of the team called on him to cut out more and more of the sweeping or complex \"operatic\" passages. &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Records\"&gt;Columbia Records&lt;/a&gt; initially declined to record the &lt;a href=\"cast%20album\"&gt;cast album&lt;/a&gt;, saying the score was too depressing and too difficult.\nThere were problems with &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Smith%20%28designer%29\"&gt;Oliver Smith&lt;/a&gt;'s designs. His painted backdrops were stunning, but the sets were, for the most part, either shabby looking or too stylized. Prince refused to spend money on new construction, and Smith was obliged to improve what he had as best he could with very little money to do it. The pre-Broadway run in Washington, D.C. was a critical and commercial success, although none of the reviews mentioned Sondheim, listed as co-lyricist, who was overshadowed by the better-known Bernstein. Bernstein magnanimously removed his name as co-author of the lyrics, although Sondheim was uncertain he wanted to receive sole credit for what he considered to be overly florid contributions by Bernstein. Robbins demanded and received a \"Conceived by\" credit, and used it to justify his making major decisions regarding changes in the show without consulting the others. As a result, by opening night on Broadway, none of his collaborators were talking to him.\nIt has been rumored that while Bernstein was off trying to fix the musical \"Candide\", Sondheim wrote some of the music for \"West Side Story\", and that Bernstein's co-lyricist billing mysteriously disappeared from the credits of \"West Side Story\" during the tryout, presumably as a trade-off. However, &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Suskin\"&gt;Steven Suskin&lt;/a&gt; writes in \"Show Tunes\" that \"As the writing progressed and the extent of Bernstein's lyric contributions became less, the composer agreed to rescind his credit. ... Contrary to rumor, Sondheim did not write music for the show; his only contribution came on \"Something's Coming\", where he developed the main strain of the chorus from music Bernstein wrote for the verse.\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\nTwo rival teenage gangs, the Jets (white Americans) and the Sharks (&lt;a href=\"Stateside%20Puerto%20Ricans\"&gt;Puerto Ricans&lt;/a&gt;), struggle for control of their neighborhood on the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20West%20Side\"&gt;Upper West Side&lt;/a&gt; of New York City (Prologue). Police officers Krupke and Lt. Schrank warn them to stop fighting on their beat. The police chase the Sharks off, and then the Jets plan how they can assure their continued dominance of the street. The Jets' leader, Riff, suggests setting up a rumble with the Sharks. He plans to make the challenge to Bernardo, the Sharks' leader, that night at the neighborhood dance. Riff wants to convince his best friend and former member of the Jets, Tony, to meet the Jets at the dance. Some of the Jets are unsure of his loyalty, but Riff is adamant that Tony is still one of them (\"Jet Song\"). Riff meets Tony while he's working at Doc's Drugstore to persuade him to come. Tony initially refuses, but Riff wins him over. Tony is convinced that something important is round the corner (\"&lt;a href=\"Something%27s%20Coming%20%28song%29\"&gt;Something's Coming&lt;/a&gt;\").\nMaria works in a bridal shop with Anita, the girlfriend of her brother, Bernardo. Maria has just arrived from Puerto Rico for her arranged marriage to Chino, a friend of Bernardo's. Maria confesses to Anita that she is not in love with Chino. Anita makes Maria a dress to wear to the neighborhood dance.\nAt the dance, after introductions, the teenagers begin to dance; soon a challenge dance is called (\"Dance at the Gym\"), during which Tony and Maria (who aren't taking part in the challenge dance) see each other across the room and are drawn to each other. They dance together, forgetting the tension in the room, and fall in love, but Bernardo pulls his sister from Tony and sends her home. Riff and Bernardo agree to meet for a War Council at Doc's, a drug store which is considered neutral ground, but meanwhile, an infatuated and happy Tony finds Maria's building and serenades her outside her bedroom (\"&lt;a href=\"Maria%20%28West%20Side%20Story%20song%29\"&gt;Maria&lt;/a&gt;\"). She appears on her fire escape, and the two profess their love for one another (\"&lt;a href=\"Tonight%20%28West%20Side%20Story%20song%29\"&gt;Tonight&lt;/a&gt;\"). Meanwhile, Anita, Rosalia, and the other Shark girls discuss the differences between the territory of Puerto Rico and the mainland United States of America, with Anita defending America, and Rosalia yearning for Puerto Rico (\"&lt;a href=\"America%20%28West%20Side%20Story%20song%29\"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;\").\nThe Jets get antsy while waiting for the Sharks inside Doc's drugstore. Riff helps them let out their aggression (\"&lt;a href=\"Cool%20%28West%20Side%20Story%20song%29\"&gt;Cool&lt;/a&gt;\"). The Sharks arrive to discuss weapons to use in the rumble. Tony suggests \"a fair fight\" (fists only), which the leaders agree to, despite the other members' protests. Bernardo believes that he will fight Tony, but must settle for fighting Diesel, Riff's second-in-command, instead. This is followed by a monologue by the ineffective Lt. Schrank trying to find out the location of the rumble. Tony tells Doc about Maria. Doc is worried for them while Tony is convinced that nothing can go wrong; he is in love.\nThe next day, Maria is in a very happy mood at the bridal shop, as she anticipates seeing Tony again, but she is dismayed when she learns about the upcoming rumble from Anita. When Tony arrives, Maria insists that he must stop the fight altogether, which he agrees to do. Before he goes, they dream of their wedding (\"&lt;a href=\"One%20Hand%2C%20One%20Heart\"&gt;One Hand, One Heart&lt;/a&gt;\"). Tony, Maria, Anita, Bernardo and the Sharks, and Riff and the Jets all anticipate the events to come that night (\"&lt;a href=\"Tonight%20Quintet\"&gt;Tonight Quintet&lt;/a&gt;\"). The gangs meet under the highway and, as the fight between Bernardo and Diesel begins, Tony arrives and tries to stop it. Though Bernardo taunts and provokes Tony, ridiculing his attempt to make peace, Tony keeps his composure. When Bernardo pushes Tony, Riff punches him in Tony's defense. The two draw their switchblades and get in a fight (\"The Rumble\"). Tony attempts to intervene, inadvertently leading to Riff being fatally stabbed by Bernardo. Tony kills Bernardo in a fit of rage, which in turn provokes an all-out fight like the fight in the Prologue. The sound of approaching police sirens is heard, and everyone scatters, except Tony, who stands in shock at what he has done. The &lt;a href=\"tomboy\"&gt;tomboy&lt;/a&gt; Anybodys, who stubbornly wishes that she could become a Jet, tells Tony to flee from the scene at the last moment and flees with the knives. Only the bodies of Riff and Bernardo remain.\nAct 2.\nBlissfully unaware that the rumble has taken place with fatal consequences, Maria giddily sings to her friends Rosalia, Teresita, and Francisca that she is in love (\"&lt;a href=\"I%20Feel%20Pretty\"&gt;I Feel Pretty&lt;/a&gt;\"). Chino brings the news that Tony has killed Bernardo, then leaves. Maria prays that what he has told her is a lie. Tony arrives to see Maria and she initially pounds on his chest with rage, but she still loves him. They plan to run away together. As the walls of Maria's bedroom disappear, they find themselves in a dreamlike world of peace (\"&lt;a href=\"Somewhere%20%28West%20Side%20Story%20song%29\"&gt;Somewhere&lt;/a&gt;\").\nTwo of the Jets, A-Rab and Baby John, are set on by Officer Krupke, but they manage to escape him. They meet the rest of the gang. To cheer themselves up, they lampoon Krupke and the other adults who don't understand them (\"&lt;a href=\"Gee%2C%20Officer%20Krupke\"&gt;Gee, Officer Krupke&lt;/a&gt;\"). Anybodys arrives and tells the Jets that she has been spying on the Puerto Ricans; she has discovered that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. The gang separates to find Tony and protect him. Action has taken charge; he accepts Anybodys into the Jets and includes her in the search.\nA grieving Anita arrives at Maria's apartment. As Tony leaves, he tells Maria to meet him at Doc's so they can run away to the country. In spite of her attempts to conceal it, Anita sees that Tony has been with Maria, and launches an angry tirade against him (\"&lt;a href=\"A%20Boy%20Like%20That\"&gt;A Boy Like That&lt;/a&gt;\"). Maria counters by telling Anita how powerful love is (\"I Have a Love\"), and Anita realizes that Maria loves Tony as much as she had loved Bernardo. She admits that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. Lt. Schrank arrives to question Maria about her brother's death, and Anita agrees to go to Doc's to tell Tony to wait. Unfortunately, the Jets, who have found Tony, have congregated at Doc's, and they taunt Anita with racist slurs and eventually attempt rape. Doc arrives and stops them. Anita is furious, and in anger spitefully delivers the wrong message, telling the Jets that Chino has shot Maria dead.\nDoc relates the news to Tony, who has been dreaming of heading to the countryside to have children with Maria. Feeling there is no longer anything to live for, Tony leaves to find Chino, begging for him to shoot him as well. Just as Tony sees Maria alive, Chino arrives and shoots Tony. The Jets, Sharks, and adults flock around the lovers. Maria holds Tony in her arms (and sings a quiet, brief reprise of \"Somewhere\") as he dies. Angry at the death of another friend, the Jets move towards the Sharks but Maria takes Chino's gun and tells everyone that \"all of [them]\" killed Tony and the others because of their hate for each other, and, \"Now I can kill too, because now I have hate!\" she yells. However, she is unable to bring herself to fire the gun and drops it, crying in grief. Gradually, all the members of both gangs assemble on either side of Tony's body, showing that the feud is over. The Jets and Sharks form a procession, and together carry Tony away, with Maria the last one in the procession.\nCharacters.\nThe Jets\nThe Jet Girls\nThe Sharks\nThe Shark Girls\nThe Adults\nMusical numbers.\nAct 2.\nNotes\nProductions.\nOriginal Broadway production.\nAfter tryouts in Washington, D.C. and &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; beginning in August 1957, the original Broadway production opened at the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Garden%20Theatre\"&gt;Winter Garden Theatre&lt;/a&gt; on September 26, 1957, to positive reviews. The production was directed and choreographed by &lt;a href=\"Jerome%20Robbins\"&gt;Jerome Robbins&lt;/a&gt;, orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Ramin\"&gt;Sid Ramin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Irwin%20Kostal\"&gt;Irwin Kostal&lt;/a&gt;, and produced by Robert E.

The Broadway revival began previews at the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29\"&gt;Palace Theatre&lt;/a&gt; on February 23, 2009, and opened on March 19, 2009. The production wove Spanish lyrics and dialogue into the English libretto. The translations are by Tony Award winner &lt;a href=\"Lin-Manuel%20Miranda\"&gt;Lin-Manuel Miranda&lt;/a&gt;. Laurents stated, \"The musical theatre and cultural conventions of 1957 made it next to impossible for the characters to have authenticity. Every member of both gangs was always a potential killer even then. Now they actually will be. Only Tony and Maria try to live in a different world\". In August 2009, some of the lyrics for \"A Boy Like That\" (\"Un Hombre Asi\") and \"I Feel Pretty\" (\"Me Siento Hermosa\"), which were previously sung in Spanish in the revival, were changed back to the original English. However, the Spanish lyrics sung by the Sharks in the \"Tonight\" (Quintet) remained in Spanish.\nThe cast featured &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Cavenaugh\"&gt;Matt Cavenaugh&lt;/a&gt; as Tony, &lt;a href=\"Josefina%20Scaglione\"&gt;Josefina Scaglione&lt;/a&gt; as Maria, and &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Olivo\"&gt;Karen Olivo&lt;/a&gt; as Anita. Olivo won the Tony Award for &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Featured%20Actress%20in%20a%20Musical\"&gt;Best Featured Actress&lt;/a&gt;, while Scaglione was nominated for the award for &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Musical\"&gt;Leading Actress&lt;/a&gt;. The cast recording won the &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Musical%20Show%20Album\"&gt;Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album&lt;/a&gt;. In July 2010, the producers reduced the size of the orchestra, replacing five musicians with an off-stage synthesizer. The production closed on January 2, 2011 after 748 performances and 27 previews. The revival sold 1,074,462 tickets on Broadway over the course of nearly two years and was a financial success.\n2020 Broadway revival.\nA Broadway revival of \"West Side Story\" began previews on December 10, 2019, and officially opened on February 20, 2020, at the &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20Theatre%20%2853rd%20Street%29\"&gt;Broadway Theatre&lt;/a&gt;. It was directed by &lt;a href=\"Ivo%20van%20Hove\"&gt;Ivo van Hove&lt;/a&gt;, with choreography by &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Teresa%20De%20Keersmaeker\"&gt;Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker&lt;/a&gt; and was produced by &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Rudin\"&gt;Scott Rudin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Diller\"&gt;Barry Diller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"David%20Geffen\"&gt;David Geffen&lt;/a&gt;. The cast included Shereen Pimentel as Maria, &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Cole%20Powell\"&gt;Isaac Cole Powell&lt;/a&gt; as Tony, &lt;a href=\"Amar%20Ramasar\"&gt;Amar Ramasar&lt;/a&gt; as Bernardo, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Jay%20Ryan\"&gt;Thomas Jay Ryan&lt;/a&gt; as Lt. Schrank and Yesenia Ayala as Anita. Scenic and lighting design were by &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Versweyveld\"&gt;Jan Versweyveld&lt;/a&gt;, with costumes by An d'Huys.\nThe production cut the song \"I Feel Pretty\" and trimmed the book to one hour and forty-five minutes (with no intermission). The setting was \"loosely updated to the present\", and direction was \"determined to snuff out any lightness that might temper the full-blown tragedy to come\". The original balletic, finger snapping choreography was replaced by swaggering, hip-hop and latin-influenced dancing. The set consisted mostly of large screens featuring video, several cast members carried &lt;a href=\"iPhone\"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;s, and the Jets were not all white. Some theatergoers felt that the set turned the theatre into a cinema, but critic &lt;a href=\"Charles%20McNulty\"&gt;Charles McNulty&lt;/a&gt; argued that it wove technology into a multimedia \"performance work that defies our usual vocabulary\". The production also drew criticism for its casting of Ramasar, who had been accused of sexually inappropriate behavior and was fired from the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Ballet\"&gt;New York City Ballet&lt;/a&gt; and suspended from \"&lt;a href=\"Carousel%20%28musical%29\"&gt;Carousel&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as the graphic staging of the Jets' assault and attempted rape of Anita which, together, \"sends a message that women\u2019s bodies are collateral damage in male artistic success\". Van Hove's casting of African American Jets, \"dangerously, shifts our focus away from the enduring problem of white supremacist violence\". While praising the cast, except for Ramasar, Alexandra Schwartz, writing in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Yorker\"&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;\", felt that the use of the videos \"dwarfs the actors with their own gigantic images... the technique is banal\", while the mixed casting of the Jets creates \"a bitter, unintended irony in the context of African-American history\".\nMarch 11, 2020 was the show's last performance before production was suspended due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Because of its opening date, it was not eligible for 2020 Tony Award consideration. The production did not reopen, and so its total run was 78 previews and 24 performances.\nOther notable US productions and tours.\nThe &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Center\"&gt;New York City Center&lt;/a&gt; Light Opera Company production played for a limited engagement of 31 performances from April 8, 1964 to May 3, 1964.

From 1982\u20131984 a tour of South America, Israel and Europe was mounted with talent from New York with direction and choreography by Jay Norman and Lee Theodore, veterans of the original Broadway cast. The Japanese &lt;a href=\"Takarazuka%20Revue\"&gt;Takarazuka Revue&lt;/a&gt; has performed the show twice. It was produced by the Moon Troupe in 1998 and again in 1999 by the Star Troupe.\nA 2000 Hong Kong production had Cantonese lyrics and featured Hong Kong rock star &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Wong%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Paul Wong&lt;/a&gt; as Tony. It was staged at the outdoor plaza of &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Cultural%20Centre\"&gt;Hong Kong Cultural Centre&lt;/a&gt;.

Typical was John Chapman's review in the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Daily%20News\"&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/a&gt;\" on September 27, 1957, headed: \"\"West Side Story\" a Splendid and Super-Modern Musical Drama\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine found the dance and gang warfare more compelling than the love story and noted that the show's \"putting choreography foremost, may prove a milestone in musical-drama history\". One writer noted: \"The story appealed to society's undercurrent of rebellion from authority that surfaced in 1950s films like \"&lt;a href=\"Rebel%20Without%20a%20Cause\"&gt;Rebel Without a Cause&lt;/a&gt;\". ... Robbins' energetic choreography and Bernstein's grand score accentuated the satiric, hard-edged lyrics of Sondheim, and Laurents' capture of the angry voice of urban youth. The play was criticized for glamorizing gangs, and its portrayal of Puerto Ricans and lack of authentic Latin casting were weaknesses. Yet, the same writer commented, the song \"America\" shows the triumph of the spirit over the obstacles often faced by immigrants. The musical also made points in its description of troubled youth and the devastating effects of poverty and racism. Juvenile delinquency is seen as an ailment of society: \"No one wants a fella with a social disease!\" The writer concluded: \"On the cusp of the 1960s, American society, still recovering from the enormous upheaval of World War II, was seeking stability and control.\"\nScore.\nBernstein's score for \"West Side Story\" blends \"jazz, Latin rhythms, symphonic sweep and musical-comedy conventions in groundbreaking ways for Broadway\". It was &lt;a href=\"orchestrated\"&gt;orchestrated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Ramin\"&gt;Sid Ramin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Irwin%20Kostal\"&gt;Irwin Kostal&lt;/a&gt; following detailed instructions from Bernstein, who then wrote revisions on their manuscript (the original, heavily annotated by Ramin, Kostal and Bernstein himself is in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at Columbia University). Ramin, Kostal and Bernstein are billed as orchestrators for the show. The original orchestra consisted of 31 players: a large Broadway pit orchestra enhanced to include 5 percussionists, a guitarist and a piano/&lt;a href=\"celesta\"&gt;celesta&lt;/a&gt; player.\nIn 1960, Bernstein prepared a &lt;a href=\"Suite%20%28music%29\"&gt;suite&lt;/a&gt; of orchestral music from the show, titled \"Symphonic Dances from West Side Story\". It consists of nine &lt;a href=\"movement%20%28music%29\"&gt;movements&lt;/a&gt;: Prologue (\"Allegro moderato\"), \"Somewhere\" (\"Adagio\"), &lt;a href=\"Scherzo\"&gt;Scherzo&lt;/a&gt; (\"Vivace e leggiero\"), &lt;a href=\"Mambo%20%28dance%29\"&gt;Mambo&lt;/a&gt; (\"Meno presto\"), &lt;a href=\"Cha-cha-cha%20%28dance%29\"&gt;Cha-Cha&lt;/a&gt; (\"Andantino con grazia\"), Meeting Scene (\"Meno mosso\"), \"Cool\" &lt;a href=\"Fugue\"&gt;Fugue&lt;/a&gt; (\"Allegretto\"), Rumble (\"Molto allegro\"), Finale (\"Adagio\"); it was premiered on February 13, 1961, in &lt;a href=\"Carnegie%20Hall\"&gt;Carnegie Hall&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Philharmonic\"&gt;New York Philharmonic&lt;/a&gt; conducted by &lt;a href=\"Lukas%20Foss\"&gt;Lukas Foss&lt;/a&gt;. The suite is included as bonus tracks on the 1957 &lt;a href=\"West%20Side%20Story%20%28Original%20Broadway%20Cast%29\"&gt;original Broadway cast recording&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnalysis of the book.\nAs in \"Romeo and Juliet\", the love between members of two rival groups in \"West Side Story\" leads to violent confrontations \"and a tragic ending with an underlying message: Violence breeds violence, so make peace and learn to share turf.\" Among the social themes explored in the musical are \"bigotry, cultural misunderstanding and the social failure to fully integrate and empower young people in constructive ways\".\nRecordings.\nRecordings of \"West Side Story\" include the following:\nFilms.\nThe 1961 &lt;a href=\"West%20Side%20Story%20%281961%20film%29\"&gt;film adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of the musical received praise from critics and the public and became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in the United States. The film won ten &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Awards\"&gt;Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt; in its eleven nominated categories, including Best Picture. It received the most Academy Awards (10 wins) of any musical film, including Best Picture. &lt;a href=\"Rita%20Moreno\"&gt;Rita Moreno&lt;/a&gt;, as Anita, was the first Latina actress ever to win an Oscar. The soundtrack album won a Grammy Award and was ranked No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" chart for a record 54 weeks. Differences in the film from the stage version include moving \"Tonight\" to follow \"America\" and \"I Feel Pretty\" to precede the rumble. Diesel is renamed Ice. \"Gee, Officer Krupke\" is moved before \"Cool\" and is sung by Riff instead of Action, and \"Cool\" is sung by Ice instead of Riff. After Riff is killed, Ice takes control of the Jets, rather than Action.\nA 2021 film adaptation, written by &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Kushner\"&gt;Tony Kushner&lt;/a&gt;, directed by &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Spielberg\"&gt;Steven Spielberg&lt;/a&gt; and choreographed by &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Peck\"&gt;Justin Peck&lt;/a&gt;, is based more closely on the Broadway musical than the 1961 film. The cast includes &lt;a href=\"Ansel%20Elgort\"&gt;Ansel Elgort&lt;/a&gt; as Tony, newcomer &lt;a href=\"Rachel%20Zegler\"&gt;Rachel Zegler&lt;/a&gt; as Maria and &lt;a href=\"Ariana%20DeBose\"&gt;Ariana DeBose&lt;/a&gt; as Anita. Moreno, who played Anita in the 1961 film, plays Valentina, a reconceived and expanded version of the character Doc, who serves as a mentor to the teenage characters. A new Black character, Abe, makes the cast \"more representative of ... 1950s New York\". Peck's choreography does not attempt to replicate Robbins' choreography.\nReferences in popular culture.\nThe television show \"&lt;a href=\"Curb%20Your%20Enthusiasm\"&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/a&gt;\" extensively referenced \"West Side Story\" in the 2009 season seven episode \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Curb%20Your%20Enthusiasm%20episodes\"&gt;Officer Krupke&lt;/a&gt;\".
