    "text": "Castell\u00f3n () is one of the three constituencies () represented in the &lt;a href=\"Corts%20Valencianes\"&gt;Corts Valencianes&lt;/a&gt;, the regional legislature of the &lt;a href=\"Valencian%20Community\"&gt;Valencian Community&lt;/a&gt;. The constituency currently elects 24 &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20%28legislator%29\"&gt;deputies&lt;/a&gt;. Its boundaries correspond to those of the Spanish &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20Castell%C3%B3n\"&gt;province of Castell\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"electoral%20system\"&gt;electoral system&lt;/a&gt; uses the &lt;a href=\"D%27Hondt%20method\"&gt;D'Hondt method&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Closed%20list\"&gt;closed-list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;, with a minimum threshold of five percent regionally.\nElectoral system.\nThe constituency was created as per the &lt;a href=\"Statute%20of%20Autonomy\"&gt;Statute of Autonomy of the Valencian Community of 1982&lt;/a&gt; and was first contested in the &lt;a href=\"1983%20Valencian%20regional%20election\"&gt;1983 regional election&lt;/a&gt;. The Statute provided for the three &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Spain\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valencian%20Community\"&gt;Valencian Community&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Alicante\"&gt;Alicante&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Castell%C3%B3n\"&gt;Castell\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Valencia\"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to be established as multi-member districts in the &lt;a href=\"Corts%20Valencianes\"&gt;Corts Valencianes&lt;/a&gt;, with this regulation being maintained under the 1987 regional electoral law. Each constituency is entitled to an initial minimum of 20 seats, with the remaining 39\u201429 until 2007\u2014being distributed in proportion to their populations (provided that the seat-to-population ratio in any given province did not exceed three times that of any other). The exception was the 1983 election, when each constituency was allocated a fixed number of seats: 29 for Alicante, 25 for Castell\u00f3n and 35 for Valencia.\nVoting is on the basis of &lt;a href=\"universal%20suffrage\"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt;, which comprises all nationals over eighteen, registered in the Valencian Community and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Amendments to the electoral law in 2011 required for &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20diaspora\"&gt;Valencians abroad&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Voter%20registration\"&gt;apply for voting&lt;/a&gt; before being permitted to vote, a system known as \"begged\" or expat vote (). Seats are elected using the &lt;a href=\"D%27Hondt%20method\"&gt;D'Hondt method&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"closed%20list\"&gt;closed list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"election%20threshold\"&gt;threshold&lt;/a&gt; of five percent of valid votes\u2014which includes blank ballots\u2014being applied regionally. Parties not reaching the threshold are not taken into consideration for seat distribution.\nThe electoral law allows for &lt;a href=\"Political%20party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Political%20alliance\"&gt;federations&lt;/a&gt; registered in the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;interior ministry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20alliance\"&gt;coalitions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grouping%20of%20electors%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;groupings of electors&lt;/a&gt; to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call\u2014fifteen before 1985\u2014whereas groupings of electors need to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they seek election\u2014one-thousandth of the electorate, with a compulsory minimum of 500 signatures, until 1985\u2014disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates."
