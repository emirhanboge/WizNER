    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; women's national volleyball team participates in international &lt;a href=\"volleyball\"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt; competitions and friendly matches. It is governed by the Israel Volleyball Association (IVA). As in any other sports, even though Israel is geographically located in Asia, it competes in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an (&lt;a href=\"European%20Volleyball%20Confederation\"&gt;CEV&lt;/a&gt;) competitions. Its best result so far was a fourth place, in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Women%27s%20European%20Volleyball%20League\"&gt;2010 European League&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. On September 11, 2010, after losing the first leg of the repechage against &lt;a href=\"Belarus%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; side by 3:2, and beating them by 3:1 at home, the team qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Women%27s%20European%20Volleyball%20Championship\"&gt;2011 European Championship&lt;/a&gt; after thirty nine years of absence on this competition.\nHistory.\nIn the beginning of the State of &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, volleyball was one of the sports with regular contests, including women's championships. But because of the &lt;a href=\"1947%E2%80%931949%20Palestine%20war\"&gt;1947\u20131949 Palestine war&lt;/a&gt;, like most of the Israeli sports, volleyball was suspended, in order to help the army in the battlefield.\nThe first time Israel women's national team participated in a prestigious competition, was the &lt;a href=\"1956%20FIVB%20Women%27s%20World%20Championship\"&gt;1956 World Championship&lt;/a&gt;, in France. The squad was seeded in a group along with the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;. Israel finished third in the group, and then went on to dispute from 11th to 17th places, where it got a final 14th, whereas &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; finished 11th and the Soviet Union claimed the world championship.\nIn 1967, the Israeli national team celebrated her first &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20European%20Volleyball%20Championship\"&gt;European Championship&lt;/a&gt;. The tournament was held in Istanbul, Turkey, and the team played in the group stages, finishing second, after &lt;a href=\"Turkey%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; and before &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;. The next stage, the final round, had the top eight teams in the tournament. There, Israel has achieved two wins and seven losses and finished eighth in the final rankings.\nFour years later, in 1971, the Israeli national team again reached the European Championship finals tournament. The tournament was held in &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, where the team played the preliminary round, reaching the second place in its group, after &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and before &lt;a href=\"England%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. This second place led to the 7th\u201312th spots placement games. Israel has achieved one win and suffered four losses in its last appearance on the European championship tournament, finishing 11th.\nProject Selinger.\nIsraeli women's national team in recent years has become a success model for imitation in other Israeli sports. Since the return of Dr. &lt;a href=\"Arie%20Selinger\"&gt;Arie Selinger&lt;/a&gt; to the Israeli coach's position, the Israeli team was dubbed \"\"Project Selinger\".\" The project was launched in the summer of 2007 with the goal of qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Summer%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;London 2012 Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. Special daily trainings were made for the evolution of the team.\nIn the spring of 2010, the Israeli team played in &lt;a href=\"2011%20Women%27s%20European%20Volleyball%20Championship\"&gt;2011 European Championship&lt;/a&gt; qualifier in Group C along with the sides of &lt;a href=\"Ukraine%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slovakia%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;. The first two stages, when Israel played Ukraine and Great Britain, finished in second place, with four wins and two losses. Not qualifying directly, the Israelis had to dispute playoff games to define the last spots. On the playoffs, Israel had to face &lt;a href=\"Belarus%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; in two matches. After losing in &lt;a href=\"Minsk\"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt; on September 4, by 3:2 (19\u201325, 18\u201325, 25\u201318, 27\u201325, 15\u201313), a week later, in &lt;a href=\"Ra%27anana\"&gt;Ra'anana&lt;/a&gt;, Israel came back for a 3:1 win (25\u201322, 16\u201325, 25\u201320, 26\u201324) in front of 1,500 spectators, giving them the spot for the final round of the 2011 competition, after thirty nine years since they last took part on the finals.\nIn June 2010 women's team began the campaign debut in the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20European%20Volleyball%20League\"&gt;European League&lt;/a&gt;. Israel has been inserted to Group B together with Turkey, &lt;a href=\"Spain%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greece%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; at the end the group stage, qualified for four major teams tournament held in late July 2010 in &lt;a href=\"Ankara\"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Turkey. Losing by 3:0 to &lt;a href=\"Serbia%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; and 3:0 to Turkey, Israel got the fourth place of the league, its best result so far in any tournament."
