In 1991, she was accepted to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20Andes%2C%20Chile\"&gt;University of The Andes&lt;/a&gt;, where she received a philosophy degree with a focus on contemporary philosophy. She has stated that she supported &lt;a href=\"Augusto%20Pinochet\"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt; regime and still defends its political work despite what she calls its \"non-systematic\" &lt;a href=\"Human%20rights%20violations%20in%20Pinochet%27s%20Chile\"&gt;human right violations&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical career.\nRising: Video-columns (2016\u22122020).\nShe began to become known due to her publication video-opinion columns shared on social networks on the Internet, where she gave her point of view on matters of interest to the Chilean national public opinion. Her editorial line was tendingly &lt;a href=\"social-conservative\"&gt;social-conservative&lt;/a&gt; in value issues whereas &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; in economics. Likewise, she showed herself as an opponent to the governments of &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Bachelet\"&gt;Michelle Bachelet&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"centre-left%20politics\"&gt;centre-left&lt;/a&gt;; 2014\u20132018) and &lt;a href=\"Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Pi%C3%B1era\"&gt;Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era&lt;/a&gt;, whom she criticizes since the beginning of his &lt;a href=\"centre-right%20politics\"&gt;centre-rightist&lt;/a&gt; second government (2018\u20132022).\nThrough these platforms and his opinion columns, he has carried out political cyberactivism for different social causes, such as so that the owners who allocate their homes for themselves, do not pay more contributions that increase the price of housing in Chile, in addition to eliminate other taxes and payments to the State that, in his opinion, raise the cost of living in the South American country. He has been in favor of immigration in &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; \u2014as a positive factor for the economy\u2014 but against irregular immigration, harshly criticizing the handling of this issue by recent governments. During the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Chilean%20protests\"&gt;2019\u201320 Social outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, she was against the mobilizations, even sarcastically commenting on an incident that occurred between a policeman and a young man. Marinovic called him a \"criminal\" and also asked about the health of the young man \"who was swimming in the &lt;a href=\"Mapocho%20river\"&gt;Mapocho&lt;/a&gt; [river].\"\nAt the end of 2020, she was proposed by &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Kast\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28Chile%2C%202019%29\"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; to be included as a candidate for the &lt;a href=\"Chilean%20Constitutional%20Convention\"&gt;Constitutional Covention&lt;/a&gt;, being finally registered with the Electoral Service on the list of \u00abVamos por Chile\u00bb, the electoral pact of &lt;a href=\"Chile%20Vamos\"&gt;Chile Vamos&lt;/a&gt; (Pi\u00f1era's coalition).\nConstitutional Convention (2021\u221222).\nOn 4 July 2021, Marinovic was invested as constituent. Nevertheless, that day was marked by riots outside the &lt;a href=\"Palacio%20Pereira\"&gt;Pereira Palace&lt;/a&gt;, groups she harshly criticized and about \u2013recording in live by &lt;a href=\"Instagram\"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; through her cellphone\u2013 she had a tense debate with future president of the Convention &lt;a href=\"Elisa%20Lonc%C3%B3n\"&gt;Elisa Lonc\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, who told Marinovic \"why did you came here to provoke?\".\nDays later, in the fourth session of the Convention, she clashed again with the now president Lonc\u00f3n on Lonc\u00f3n's statements about the death of the &lt;a href=\"Mapuche\"&gt;Mapuche&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Weichafe\"&gt;Weichafe&lt;/a&gt; Pablo Marchant in &lt;a href=\"Carahue\"&gt;Carahue&lt;/a&gt;, who died in a confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Carabineros%20de%20Chile\"&gt;Carabineros de Chile&lt;/a&gt;. Marinovic reminded that Lonc\u00f3n \u00abis the president of the all Convention\u00bb and that her \u00abdebatable\u00bb opinions were unnecessary. Likewise, Marinovic has called &lt;a href=\"Machi%20%28Mapuche%20spirital%20healer%29\"&gt;Machi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Francisca%20Linconao\"&gt;Francisca Linconao&lt;/a&gt; a \u00ab&lt;a href=\"dictator\"&gt;dictator&lt;/a&gt;\u00bb. Then, in the tense ninth session of 20 July (due to the issue of &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt;), she directly criticized to Linconao for speaking in &lt;a href=\"Mapudungun\"&gt;Mapudungun&lt;/a&gt; and not in &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;. Because to all of that, Marinovic was criticized by constituents like &lt;a href=\"Ramona%20Reyes\"&gt;Ramona Reyes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Party%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;), who considered Marinovic as a &lt;a href=\"racism\"&gt;racist&lt;/a&gt; person. Later, the same day, she was faced by the constituent &lt;a href=\"Valentina%20Miranda\"&gt;Valentina Miranda&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;), who told Marinovic to \u00abkeep that intolerance\u00bb for herself. Besides, Miranda assured said that to her in representation of who are of &lt;a href=\"Mapuche\"&gt;Mapuche descent&lt;/a&gt;, reason why \u2013according her\u2013 she weared the &lt;a href=\"Colo-Colo\"&gt;Colo-Colo&lt;/a&gt; T-Shirt.\nTwo days after the controversy with Linconao, the &lt;a href=\"centre-right%20politics\"&gt;centre-right&lt;/a&gt; constituent &lt;a href=\"Hern%C3%A1n%20Larra%C3%ADn%20Matte\"&gt;Hern\u00e1n Larra\u00edn Matte&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ev%C3%B3poli\"&gt;Ev\u00f3poli&lt;/a&gt;) stated that: \"I told Teresa Marinovic that I did not agree with the provocation she made\". and that \u00aball deserve respect\u00bb. Elapsed the controversy, on 29 July, she received a gift from the poet Felipe Cussen: a Mapudungun dictionary for that \u00abtogether let's learn this beautiful language\u00bb; she took the present with humor and published herself smiling with the dictionary on her Instagram account.\nOn 3 August 2021, she generated controversy after getting into a shouting match with &lt;a href=\"Jaime%20Bassa\"&gt;Jaime Bassa&lt;/a&gt;, the vicepresident of the Convention.\nPersonal life.\nShe has nine sons of her first marriage, which she divorced.\nHer current couple is the &lt;a href=\"lawyer\"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; Enrique Alcalde Rodr\u00edguez, member of the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Supreme Court of Chile&lt;/a&gt;."
