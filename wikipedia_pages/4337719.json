    "text": "John (Jack) McCallister (January 19, 1879 \u2013 October 18, 1946) was manager of the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"1927%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season\"&gt;1927 season&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Tris%20Speaker\"&gt;Tris Speaker&lt;/a&gt; abruptly resigned. He would lead the Indians to a sixth-place finish and a 66-87 record.\nHe began his professional career in his native &lt;a href=\"Marietta%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Marietta, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. In 1902, he was playing for the &lt;a href=\"Hartford%20Senators\"&gt;Hartford Senators&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%20League\"&gt;Connecticut League&lt;/a&gt;, and was expected to play for the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; the following year. However, in the fall of 1902 his knee was severely injured during a benefit game in Marietta, and he was unable to play for two years. After working as an umpire in 1905, he became a manager of the Portsmouth Cobblers of the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20League\"&gt;Ohio State League&lt;/a&gt; in 1909; he later managed the Akron team in the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%E2%80%93Pennsylvania%20League\"&gt;Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Central%20League\"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt; leagues. In 1913, the Indians hired him as a coach and scout. McCallister was Tris Speaker's primary assistant during his years as player-manager (1919\u20131926). McCallister became manager after Speaker's sudden resignation in late 1926. A second-place team in 1926, the Indians entered the &lt;a href=\"1927%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season\"&gt;1927 season&lt;/a&gt; with a largely unchanged roster, except that Hall of Fame center fielder Speaker now played in &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;; the team won twenty-two fewer games in 1927. When asked about the reasons for the Indians' disappointing performance, McCallister replied, \"I guess it is that I just can't play centerfield.\" Following a change of ownership at the end of the season, McCallister's contract was not renewed. After spending the 1928 season as a coach and scout for the &lt;a href=\"1928%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt;, he worked as a scout for the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; (1929\u201333), the &lt;a href=\"1934%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; (1934), and the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Braves%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Boston Braves&lt;/a&gt; (1936\u201346). He died in &lt;a href=\"Columbus%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Columbus, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;."
