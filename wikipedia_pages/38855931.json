    "text": "The Mass No. 3 in &lt;a href=\"B-flat%20major\"&gt;B-flat major&lt;/a&gt;, 324, is a &lt;a href=\"mass%20%28music%29\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; composed by &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Schubert\"&gt;Franz Schubert&lt;/a&gt; in 1815. It is written for four soloists, a four-part choir and orchestra. While by length it could be a &lt;a href=\"missa%20brevis\"&gt;missa brevis&lt;/a&gt;, its large orchestral force with &lt;a href=\"trumpet\"&gt;trumpet&lt;/a&gt;s, timpani and &lt;a href=\"woodwind%20instrument\"&gt;woodwind&lt;/a&gt;s has also led to its classification as a &lt;a href=\"missa%20solemnis\"&gt;missa solemnis&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nSchubert composed this mass setting a few months after his &lt;a href=\"Mass%20No.%202%20%28Schubert%29\"&gt;mass in G major&lt;/a&gt;, beginning on 11 November 1815. The occasion for which it was composed is unknown; however, it is thought that the soprano soloist in the first performance was &lt;a href=\"Therese%20Grob\"&gt;Therese Grob&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests that it was written for the &lt;a href=\"Lichtental%20Church\"&gt;Lichtental Parish Church&lt;/a&gt;; Schubert may also have been attempting to create opportunities to spend time with Grob, with whom he was deeply in love.\nIts large orchestral component and extended orchestral interludes have been called \"&lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Haydn\"&gt;Haydnesque&lt;/a&gt;\"; the latter's &lt;a href=\"Missa%20in%20Angustiis\"&gt;Nelson Mass&lt;/a&gt; has been cited as a particularly strong influence. References to &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart\"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach\"&gt;Bach&lt;/a&gt; have also been noted.\nWhile little is now known about the circumstances of the original performance, the mass was familiar outside &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;. Schubert received a letter from his brother &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Schubert\"&gt;Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt; on 6 October 1824, saying that he had been asked to play the organ for a performance of a mass in &lt;a href=\"Hainburg%20an%20der%20Donau\"&gt;Hainburg&lt;/a&gt;. The mass was by a famous composer whose identity was unknown to the invitees; upon receiving it, Ferdinand recognised his brother's work.\nStructure and scoring.\nThe mass consists of six &lt;a href=\"movement%20%28music%29\"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt;s. Performances require approximately 30 minutes. It is scored for &lt;a href=\"soprano\"&gt;soprano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"alto\"&gt;alto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bass%20%28voice%20type%29\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt; soloists, a four-part choir (&lt;a href=\"SATB\"&gt;SATB&lt;/a&gt;) and an orchestra of 2 &lt;a href=\"trumpet\"&gt;trumpet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"timpani\"&gt;timpani&lt;/a&gt;, 2 &lt;a href=\"oboe\"&gt;oboe&lt;/a&gt;s, 2 &lt;a href=\"bassoon\"&gt;bassoon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"violin\"&gt;violin&lt;/a&gt; I and II, &lt;a href=\"viola\"&gt;viola&lt;/a&gt; and (&lt;a href=\"cello\"&gt;cello&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"double%20bass\"&gt;double bass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pipe%20organ\"&gt;organ&lt;/a&gt;). \nIn the following table of the movements, the markings, &lt;a href=\"Key%20%28music%29\"&gt;keys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"time%20signature\"&gt;time signature&lt;/a&gt;s are taken from the choral score, using the symbol for alla breve (2/2). The voices are abbreviated for the four-part choir (&lt;a href=\"SATB\"&gt;SATB&lt;/a&gt;), and the solo voices soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B). "
