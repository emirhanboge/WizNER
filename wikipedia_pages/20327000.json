    "text": "Norman Hampton Humphries (19 May 1917 \u2013 18 December 2000) was an English &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;er who played &lt;a href=\"first-class%20cricket\"&gt;first-class cricket&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Worcestershire&lt;/a&gt; in 1946. He also played &lt;a href=\"minor%20counties\"&gt;minor counties&lt;/a&gt; cricket for &lt;a href=\"Devon%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; between 1938 and 1955.\nHumphries made his debut near the end of June 1946, against &lt;a href=\"Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Warwickshire&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Edgbaston%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Edgbaston&lt;/a&gt;, and scored 21 in his only innings.\nAfter making 3 in the first innings of his next game, against &lt;a href=\"Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Glamorgan&lt;/a&gt;, he showed quite some consistency, his next five innings being 22, 16, 17, 22 and 16.\nHowever, he was unable to break through and produce a significant score, and after this one season he was never again to appear at first-class level.\nFor Devon, however, it could be a different story, and in June 1949 Humphries produced his finest form. First he hit 199 against &lt;a href=\"Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; II,\nand immediately thereafter he struck 216 &lt;a href=\"not%20out\"&gt;not out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carry%20the%20bat\"&gt;carrying his bat&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt; II. By coincidence, in this game &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Brazier\"&gt;Alan Brazier&lt;/a&gt; made 216 not out in Surrey II's own first innings!\nTwo brothers, &lt;a href=\"Cedric%20Humphries\"&gt;Cedric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Humphries\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;, also played for Worcestershire."
