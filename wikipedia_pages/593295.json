    "text": "Sylhet () is a &lt;a href=\"metropolis\"&gt;metropolitan city&lt;/a&gt; in northeastern &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;. It is the administrative seat of &lt;a href=\"Sylhet%20Division\"&gt;Sylhet Division&lt;/a&gt;. Located on the north bank of the &lt;a href=\"Surma%20River\"&gt;Surma River&lt;/a&gt; at the eastern tip of &lt;a href=\"Bengal\"&gt;Bengal&lt;/a&gt;, Sylhet has a &lt;a href=\"subtropical\"&gt;subtropical&lt;/a&gt; climate and lush highland terrain. The city has a population of more than half a million, and is one of the largest cities in Bangladesh after &lt;a href=\"Khulna\"&gt;Khulna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chittagong\"&gt;Chittagong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;. Sylhet is one of the most important spiritual and cultural centres in Bangladesh. Furthermore, it is one of the most economically important cities in the country after &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chittagong\"&gt;Chittagong&lt;/a&gt;. The city produces the highest amount of tea and natural gas in the country.\nIn 1303, the Sultan of Lakhnauti &lt;a href=\"Shamsuddin%20Firoz%20Shah\"&gt;Shamsuddin Firoz Shah&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20of%20Sylhet\"&gt;conquered Sylhet&lt;/a&gt; by defeating &lt;a href=\"Gour%20Govinda\"&gt;Gour Govinda&lt;/a&gt;. Sylhet was a realm of the &lt;a href=\"Bengal%20Sultanate\"&gt;Bengal Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;. In the 16th-century, Sylhet was controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Baro-Bhuyan\"&gt;Baro-Bhuyan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zamindar\"&gt;zamindar&lt;/a&gt;s and later became a sarkar (district) of the &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20Empire\"&gt;Mughal Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Sylhet emerged as the Mughals' most significant imperial outpost in the east and its importance remained as such throughout the seventeenth century. &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British rule&lt;/a&gt; began in the 18th century under the administration of the &lt;a href=\"East%20India%20Company\"&gt;East India Company&lt;/a&gt;. With its ancient seafaring tradition, Sylhet became a key source of &lt;a href=\"lascar\"&gt;lascar&lt;/a&gt;s in the British Empire. The Sylhet municipal board was established in 1867. Originally part of the &lt;a href=\"Bengal%20Presidency\"&gt;Bengal Presidency&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Bengal%20and%20Assam\"&gt;Eastern Bengal and Assam&lt;/a&gt;; the town was part of Colonial Assam between 1874 and 1947, when following a &lt;a href=\"1947%20Sylhet%20referendum\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"partition%20of%20British%20India\"&gt;partition of British India&lt;/a&gt;, it became part of East Bengal. The &lt;a href=\"Sylhet%20City%20Corporation\"&gt;Sylhet City Corporation&lt;/a&gt; was constituted in 2001. The Government of Bangladesh designated Sylhet a metropolitan area in 2009.\nThe hinterland of the Sylhet valley is the largest &lt;a href=\"Natural%20gas%20and%20petroleum%20in%20Bangladesh\"&gt;oil and gas&lt;/a&gt;-producing region in Bangladesh. It is also the largest hub of &lt;a href=\"tea%20production%20in%20Bangladesh\"&gt;tea production in Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;. It is notable for its high-quality &lt;a href=\"Arundo\"&gt;cane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"agarwood\"&gt;agarwood&lt;/a&gt;. The city is served by the &lt;a href=\"Osmani%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Osmani International Airport&lt;/a&gt; which is named after &lt;a href=\"M.%20A.%20G.%20Osmani\"&gt;General Bangabir M A G Osmani&lt;/a&gt;, the Commander-in-Chief of the &lt;a href=\"Mukti%20Bahini\"&gt;Mukti Bahini&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War\"&gt;Bangladesh Liberation War&lt;/a&gt;. People from Sylhet form a significant portion of the &lt;a href=\"Bangladeshi%20diaspora\"&gt;Bangladeshi diaspora&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as other countries in the Middle East.\nToponymy.\nIn Bengal, Sylhet has been called as \"Srih\u00f4\u1e6d\u1e6d\u00f4\" (in &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20language\"&gt;Bangla&lt;/a&gt; : \u09b6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c0\u09b9\u099f\u09cd\u099f) or \"Srihatta\" since the ancient time in the &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20language\"&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt; and regional &lt;a href=\"Sylheti%20language\"&gt;Siloti&lt;/a&gt; language.\u00a0\nThe name \"Sylhet\" is an &lt;a href=\"anglicisation\"&gt;anglicisation&lt;/a&gt; of \"Shilhot\" (\u09b6\u09bf\u09b2\u09b9\u099f). Its origins seem to come from the &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; according to the words of \u09b6\u09bf\u09b2\u09be \u015bil\u0101 (meaning stone) and \u09b9\u099f\u09cd\u099f ha\u1e6d\u1e6da (meaning marketplace). These words match the landscape and topography of the hilly region. The shila stones were abundant across Sylhet and the King &lt;a href=\"Gour%20Govinda\"&gt;Gour Govinda&lt;/a&gt; is known to have used stones to guard his capital. The word had changed to Shilhot due to the &lt;a href=\"elision\"&gt;elision&lt;/a&gt; of letter-final \"\u00f4\" in the &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20language\"&gt;Bengali language&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn 1995, the Government of Bangladesh declared Sylhet as the sixth &lt;a href=\"Divisions%20of%20Bangladesh\"&gt;divisional headquarters&lt;/a&gt; of the country. Sylhet has played a vital role in the &lt;a href=\"Bangladeshi%20economy\"&gt;Bangladeshi economy&lt;/a&gt;. Several of Bangladesh's &lt;a href=\"Finance%20Minister%20of%20Bangladesh\"&gt;finance ministers&lt;/a&gt; have been Members of Parliament from the city of Sylhet. &lt;a href=\"Badar%20Uddin%20Ahmed%20Kamran\"&gt;Badar Uddin Ahmed Kamran&lt;/a&gt; was a longtime mayor of Sylhet. &lt;a href=\"Humayun%20Rashid%20Choudhury\"&gt;Humayun Rashid Choudhury&lt;/a&gt;, a diplomat from Sylhet, served as &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20UN%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;President of the UN General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; and Speaker of the &lt;a href=\"Jatiyo%20Sangshad\"&gt;Bangladesh National Parliament&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2001, the municipality was upgraded to the &lt;a href=\"Sylhet%20City%20Corporation\"&gt;Sylhet City Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. It was made a metropolitan city in 2009.\nGeography and climate.\nSylhet is located at , in the northeastern region of Bangladesh within the Sylhet Division, the Sylhet District and Sylhet Sadar Upazila. Sylhet has a typical Bangladeshi &lt;a href=\"tropical%20monsoon%20climate\"&gt;tropical monsoon climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; \"Am\") bordering on a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Cwa\") at higher elevations. The rainy season starts from April to October and it is so hot and humid with very heavy showers and thunderstorms almost every day, whilst the short dry season starts from November to February and it is very warm and fairly clear. Nearly 80% of the annual average rainfall of occurs between May and September.\nThe city is located within the region where there are hills and basins which constitute one of the most distinctive regions in Bangladesh. The &lt;a href=\"physiography\"&gt;physiography&lt;/a&gt; of Sylhet consists mainly of hill soils, encompassing a few large depressions known locally as \"&lt;a href=\"beel\"&gt;beel&lt;/a&gt;s\" which can be mainly classified as &lt;a href=\"oxbow%20lake\"&gt;oxbow lake&lt;/a&gt;s, caused by tectonic subsidence primarily during &lt;a href=\"1762%20Arakan%20earthquake\"&gt;the earthquake of 1762&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeologically, the region is complex having diverse sacrificial geomorphology; high topography of Plio-&lt;a href=\"Miocene\"&gt;Miocene&lt;/a&gt; age. Available limestone deposits in different parts of the region suggest that the whole area was under the ocean in the Oligo-Miocene. In the last 150 years three major earthquakes hit the city, at a magnitude of at least 7.5 on the &lt;a href=\"Richter%20Scale\"&gt;Richter Scale&lt;/a&gt;, the last one took place in 1918, although many people are unaware that Sylhet lies on an earthquake prone zone.\nAdministration.\nSylhet is divided into 6 metropolitan &lt;a href=\"Thanas%20of%20Bangladesh\"&gt;thana&lt;/a&gt;s(police station) and consists of 27 wards and 224 mahallas. The thanas are:\nIt is a small city with an area of 26.50\u00a0km2. The rapid growth and expansion of Sylhet occurred during the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;colonial period&lt;/a&gt;. Sylhet Municipality was established in 1878. A devastating earthquake demolished almost the entire town on &lt;a href=\"1897%20Assam%20earthquake\"&gt;12 June 1897&lt;/a&gt; following which a modern and European model new town was built on the wreckage. Many new roads were constructed in the late 1890s and Sylhet became really connected to the other parts of the country with the establishment of an extension line of &lt;a href=\"Assam%20Bengal%20Railway\"&gt;Assam Bengal Railway&lt;/a&gt; in 1912\u201315. From the beginning of the 20th century, the importance of Sylhet increased with the establishment of the tea industry. In the 1950s and 1960s, rapid urbanisation took place in the town, fostered by the expatriate Sylhetis and the process is still ongoing.\nOn 10 April 2001, Sylhet was changed to a city corporation from a municipal board, and currently the city is administrated by the \"Sylhet City Corporation\". At present, Sylhet is the district-headquarters as well as the divisional headquarters of the districts of &lt;a href=\"Sunamganj\"&gt;Sunamganj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Habiganj\"&gt;Habiganj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moulvibazar%20District\"&gt;Moulvibazar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylhet%20District\"&gt;Sylhet District&lt;/a&gt;.
