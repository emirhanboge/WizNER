Following the loss to the Falcons, the Winston-led Buccaneers began playing efficient offense as well as exceptional defense and special teams play, resulting in the Buccaneers' first five-game winning streak since their Super Bowl-winning &lt;a href=\"2002%20Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers%20season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;. The win streak gave the Buccaneers possession of the 6th seed in the NFC playoff race, which they quickly lost after back-to-back losses to the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2016%20New%20Orleans%20Saints%20season\"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt;.

During week 5 against the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Washington%20Football%20Team%20season\"&gt;Washington Football Team&lt;/a&gt; Winston and the Saints overcame two early turnovers to beat Washington 33\u201322 while throwing for 279 yards, 4 touchdowns and 1 interception, along with a fumble.\nIn Week 8 against the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers%20season\"&gt;Tampa Bay Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, Winston went 6 of 10 for 56 yards and one touchdown, along with 4 rushes for 40 yards before having to leave the game in the second quarter due to a knee injury after being &lt;a href=\"horse-collar%20tackle\"&gt;horse-collar tackle&lt;/a&gt;d by Tampa Bay linebacker &lt;a href=\"Devin%20White\"&gt;Devin White&lt;/a&gt;. He would be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Siemian\"&gt;Trevor Siemian&lt;/a&gt;, who went on to win the game, 36\u201327. The next day, it was revealed that Winston had suffered a &lt;a href=\"Anterior%20cruciate%20ligament%20injury\"&gt;torn ACL&lt;/a&gt; and had &lt;a href=\"Medial%20knee%20injuries\"&gt;MCL damage&lt;/a&gt;, ending his season.\nPersonal life.\nWinston married his wife, Breion Allen, in a private ceremony held at their home on March 27, 2020. They have one son together.\nControversies.\nSexual assault allegation.\nOn November 14, 2013, the &lt;a href=\"State%27s%20attorney\"&gt;State Attorney&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Judicial%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Florida\"&gt;Second Judicial Circuit&lt;/a&gt; announced they were opening an investigation into a sexual assault allegation involving Winston that was originally filed with the &lt;a href=\"Tallahassee%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Tallahassee Police Department&lt;/a&gt; (TPD) on December 7, 2012. The complaint was originally investigated by the police and classified as open/inactive in February 2013 with no charges being filed. The police report, containing the complainant's original statement, has been posted by the Tallahassee Police Department. Tallahassee police stated that the complaint was made inactive \"when the victim in the case broke off contact with TPD, and her attorney indicated she did not want to move forward at that time\" and then re-examined after media requests for information started coming in early November. On December 5, 2013, State Attorney Willie Meggs announced the completion of the investigation and that no charges would be filed against anyone in this case, citing \"major issues\" with the woman's testimony. Meggs stated that \"As prosecutors, we only bring charges for cases where the evidence will result in a likely conviction at trial. In this case, the evidence does not show that.\" Allegations of improper police conduct have been made by both parties, with the complainant claiming to have been pressured into dropping her claim and Winston's attorney alleging inappropriate leaks to the media. Florida State's policy is that athletes charged with a felony cannot play until their case is resolved, but Winston continued to play throughout the investigation because he was never charged.\nOn April 16, 2014, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" reported irregularities in the rape investigation involving Winston. The complainant developed bruises and semen was found on her underwear. 34 days later, the complainant identified Winston by name as her attacker. Tallahassee police contacted Winston about 13 days later. No DNA sample was taken from Winston until the prosecutor took over the case, months later; once it was taken in November 2013, it was found to match DNA found in the complainant's underwear. The investigation was conducted by Officer Scott Angulo, who, the \"Times\" article notes, did private security work for the Seminole Boosters, the primary financier of Florida State athletics.\nThe official FSU hearing, presided over by retired Florida Supreme Court Justice &lt;a href=\"Major%20B.%20Harding\"&gt;Major B. Harding&lt;/a&gt;, on December 21, 2014, cleared Winston of violating the student conduct code in the sexual assault allegation. An extract from Harding's decision is below.\nI do not find the credibility of one story substantially stronger than that of the other. Both have their own strengths and weaknesses. I cannot find with any confidence that the events as set forth by you, (accuser), or a particular combination thereof is more probable than not as required to find you responsible for a violation of the Code. Therein lies the determinative factor of my decision.\nThe accuser filed a civil suit against Winston in April 2014 and Winston countersued her for &lt;a href=\"defamation\"&gt;defamation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tortious%20interference\"&gt;tortious interference&lt;/a&gt; in May 2014. In a September 2015 ruling, federal judge &lt;a href=\"Anne%20C.%20Conway\"&gt;Anne C. Conway&lt;/a&gt; dismissed Winston's tortious interference claim, but declined a motion to dismiss his claim for defamation. These civil claims were settled out of court in December 2016, four months before the case was scheduled to go to trial.\nIn November 2015, Winston told &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; that he was prepared to file suit if the network aired \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hunting%20Ground\"&gt;The Hunting Ground&lt;/a&gt;\", a documentary about college campus rape which includes disputed allegations about Winston. CNN was undeterred and aired the documentary on November 22, 2015.&lt;ref name=\"McCarthy_11/22/2015\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn 2016, the university paid $950,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by the same woman alleging a violation of &lt;a href=\"Title%20IX\"&gt;Title IX&lt;/a&gt; by FSU in handling her complaint. The university also agreed to conduct five years of sexual awareness programs. It did not admit liability.\nShoplifting incidents.\nIn July 2013, a &lt;a href=\"Burger%20King\"&gt;Burger King&lt;/a&gt; employee called police in July to complain that Winston was stealing soda. According to the police report, Winston came into the restaurant with three men, but did not order any food. An employee, who recognized him, first saw him using ketchup cups to take some soda. He asked for a water cup after she told him to stop, but he said he would use it for soda and filled it repeatedly with soda over her objections, the report said. On April 29, 2014, Winston was issued an &lt;a href=\"Summary%20offence%23United%20States\"&gt;adult civil citation&lt;/a&gt; for shoplifting &lt;a href=\"crab%20legs\"&gt;crab legs&lt;/a&gt; from a Tallahassee &lt;a href=\"Publix\"&gt;Publix&lt;/a&gt; store. Winston was ordered to undergo 20 hours of &lt;a href=\"community%20service\"&gt;community service&lt;/a&gt;, and was suspended from any college baseball activity until he completed his community service.\nVulgar comments.\nOn September 17, 2014, Winston was suspended for the first half of Florida State's upcoming game against Clemson. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that \"several students tweeted\" that Winston shouted, \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Internet%20phenomena%23Videos\"&gt;Fuck her right in the pussy&lt;/a&gt;!\" an &lt;a href=\"Internet%20meme\"&gt;Internet meme&lt;/a&gt;, while standing atop a table in Florida State University's Student Union. Two days later, university president &lt;a href=\"Garnett%20S.%20Stokes\"&gt;Garnett S. Stokes&lt;/a&gt; and athletic director Stan Wilcox, citing results of an \"ongoing investigation\", announced that Winston would be suspended for the whole game.\n2017 groping allegation.\nOn November 17, 2017, it was reported that the NFL conducted an investigation, where Winston allegedly groped a female &lt;a href=\"Uber\"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; driver in 2016. Two days later, it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Darby\"&gt;Ronald Darby&lt;/a&gt;, who also attended Florida State, was also on board during the ride in which this incident supposedly occurred. Darby has defended Winston against the allegations. However, the investigation found evidence that Winston got into another Uber ride alone, which was consistent with the Uber driver's account, and concluded that Winston \"violated the Personal Conduct Policy by touching the driver in an\ninappropriate and sexual manner without her consent\". The league announced on June 21 that it was suspending Winston for the first three games of the &lt;a href=\"2018%20NFL%20season\"&gt;2018 season&lt;/a&gt; as a result of his involvement in the incident, which it carried through on June 28."
