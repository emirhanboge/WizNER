    "text": "Sun Yat-sen (; born Sun Deming; 12 November 1866 \u2013 12 March 1925) was a Chinese &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;statesman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"physician\"&gt;physician&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"political%20philosopher\"&gt;political philosopher&lt;/a&gt;, who served as the provisional first president of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; and the first leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; (Nationalist Party of China). He is called the \"&lt;a href=\"Father%20of%20the%20Nation\"&gt;Father of the Nation&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"Forerunner of the Revolution\" in the People's Republic of China for his instrumental role in the overthrow of the &lt;a href=\"Qing%20dynasty\"&gt;Qing dynasty&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution\"&gt;Xinhai Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Sun is unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for being widely revered in both &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSun is considered to be one of the greatest leaders of modern China, but his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent exile. After the success of the revolution in 1911, he quickly resigned as President of the newly founded Republic of China and relinquished it to &lt;a href=\"Yuan%20Shikai\"&gt;Yuan Shikai&lt;/a&gt;. He soon went to exile in Japan for safety but returned to found a revolutionary government in the South as a challenge to the &lt;a href=\"warlord%20Era\"&gt;warlords&lt;/a&gt; who controlled much of the nation. In 1923, he invited representatives of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20International\"&gt;Communist International&lt;/a&gt; to Canton to re-organize his party and formed a brittle alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Chinese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;. He did not live to see his party unify the country under his successor, &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Expedition%20%281926%E2%80%931927%29\"&gt;Northern Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. He died in Beijing of &lt;a href=\"gallbladder%20cancer\"&gt;gallbladder cancer&lt;/a&gt; on 12 March 1925.\nSun's chief legacy is his political philosophy known as the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Principles%20of%20the%20People\"&gt;Three Principles of the People&lt;/a&gt;: M\u00ednz\u00fa (\u6c11\u65cf\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednz\u00fa Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) or &lt;a href=\"nationalism\"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt; (independence from foreign domination), M\u00ednqu\u00e1n (\u6c11\u6b0a\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednqu\u00e1n Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) or \"rights of the people\" (sometimes translated as \"democracy\"), and M\u00ednsh\u0113ng (\u6c11\u751f\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednsh\u0113ng Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) or people's livelihood (sometimes translated as \"communitarianism\" or \"welfare\").\nNames.\nSun's was Sun Deming (\"Sy\u016bn D\u0101k-m\u00echng\"; ). As a child, his was Tai Tseung (\"Dai-jeuhng\"; ). When in school, the teacher gave him the name Sun Wen (&lt;a href=\"Cantonese\"&gt;Cantonese&lt;/a&gt;: \"Sy\u016bn M\u00e0hn\"; ), which was what Sun called himself for most of his life. Sun's &lt;a href=\"courtesy%20name\"&gt;courtesy name&lt;/a&gt; was Zaizhi (\"Jai-j\u012b\"; ), and his baptized name was Rixin (\"Yaht-s\u0101n\"; ). While at school in Hong Kong he got the &lt;a href=\"art%20name\"&gt;art name&lt;/a&gt; Yat-sen (). Sun Zhongshan (; &lt;a href=\"Cantonese\"&gt;Cantonese&lt;/a&gt;: , romanized \"Chung Shan\"), the most popular of his Chinese names in China, is derived from his &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20name\"&gt;Japanese name&lt;/a&gt; \"Kikori Nakayama\" (), the pseudonym given to him by &lt;a href=\"T%C5%8Dten%20Miyazaki\"&gt;T\u014dten Miyazaki&lt;/a&gt; while in hiding in Japan. His birthplace city was renamed &lt;a href=\"Zhongshan\"&gt;Zhongshan&lt;/a&gt; in his honour probably shortly after his death in 1925, using this name. Zhongshan is one of the few &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20places%20named%20after%20people\"&gt;cities named after people&lt;/a&gt; in China.\nEarly years.\nBirthplace and early life.\nSun Deming was born on 12 November 1866 to Sun Dacheng and &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Yang\"&gt;Madame Yang&lt;/a&gt;. His birthplace was the village of &lt;a href=\"Cuiheng\"&gt;Cuiheng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xiangshan%20County%2C%20Guangdong\"&gt;Xiangshan County&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Zhongshan\"&gt;Zhongshan&lt;/a&gt; City), &lt;a href=\"Guangdong\"&gt;Guangdong&lt;/a&gt;. He had a cultural background of &lt;a href=\"Hakka\"&gt;Hakka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cantonese%20people\"&gt;Cantonese&lt;/a&gt;. His father owned very little land and worked as a tailor in &lt;a href=\"Macau\"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt;, and as a journeyman and a porter. After finishing primary education, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Honolulu\"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;Kingdom of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, where he lived a comfortable life of modest wealth supported by his elder brother Sun Mei. He obtained secondary schooling in Hawaii.\nEducation years.\nAt the age of 10, Sun began seeking schooling, and he met childhood friend &lt;a href=\"Lu%20Haodong\"&gt;Lu Haodong&lt;/a&gt;. By age 13 in 1878, after receiving a few years of local schooling, Sun went to live with his elder brother, &lt;a href=\"Family%20tree%20of%20Sun%20Yat-sen\"&gt;Sun Mei&lt;/a&gt; () in &lt;a href=\"Honolulu\"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;. Sun Mei financed Sun Yat-sen's education and would later be a major contributor for the overthrow of the Manchus.\nDuring his stay in Honolulu, Sun Yat-sen went to &lt;a href=\"%CA%BBIolani%20School\"&gt;\u02bbIolani School&lt;/a&gt; where he studied English, &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British history&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, science, and Christianity. While he was originally unable to speak English, Sun Yat-sen quickly picked up the language and received a prize for academic achievement from &lt;a href=\"David%20Kal%C4%81kaua\"&gt;King David Kal\u0101kaua&lt;/a&gt; before graduating in 1882. He then attended &lt;a href=\"Oahu%20College\"&gt;Oahu College&lt;/a&gt; (now known as &lt;a href=\"Punahou%20School\"&gt;Punahou School&lt;/a&gt;) for one semester. In 1883 he was sent home to China as his brother was becoming worried that Sun Yat-sen was beginning to embrace Christianity.\nWhen he returned to China in 1883 at age 17, Sun met up with his childhood friend Lu Haodong again at Beijidian (), a temple in Cuiheng Village. They saw many villagers worshipping the Beiji (literally \"&lt;a href=\"North%20Pole\"&gt;North Pole&lt;/a&gt;\") Emperor-God in the temple, and were dissatisfied with their ancient healing methods. They broke the statue, incurring the wrath of fellow villagers, and escaped to Hong Kong. After arriving in Hong Kong in November 1883, he studied at the Diocesan Home and Orphanage on &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Street%20%28Hong%20Kong%29\"&gt;Eastern Street&lt;/a&gt; (now the &lt;a href=\"Diocesan%20Boys%27%20School\"&gt;Diocesan Boys' School&lt;/a&gt;), and from 15 April 1884 to his graduation in 1886, he was at &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;The Government Central School&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Gough%20Street\"&gt;Gough Street&lt;/a&gt; (now Queen's College).\nIn 1886 Sun studied medicine at the &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou%20Boji%20Hospital\"&gt;Guangzhou Boji Hospital&lt;/a&gt; under the Christian missionary &lt;a href=\"John%20Glasgow%20Kerr\"&gt;John G. Kerr&lt;/a&gt;. According to his book \"Kidnapped in London\", Sun in 1887 heard of the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20College%20of%20Medicine%20for%20Chinese\"&gt;Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese&lt;/a&gt; (the forerunner of &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;The University of Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;) and immediately decided to benefit from the \"advantages it offered.\" Ultimately, he earned the license of Christian practice as a &lt;a href=\"medical%20doctor\"&gt;medical doctor&lt;/a&gt; from there in 1892. Notably, of his class of 12 students, Sun was one of only two who graduated.\nReligious views and Christian baptism.\nIn the early 1880s, Sun Mei sent his brother to &lt;a href=\"%CA%BBIolani%20School\"&gt;\u02bbIolani School&lt;/a&gt;, which was under the supervision of the &lt;a href=\"Church_of_Hawaii\"&gt;Church of Hawai'i&lt;/a&gt; and directed by an Anglican prelate named &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Willis\"&gt;Alfred Willis&lt;/a&gt;, with the language of instruction being &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;. At the school, a young Sun Wen first came in contact with Christianity. In his work, Schriffin speculated that Christianity was to have a great influence on Sun's future political career.\nSun was later &lt;a href=\"Baptism\"&gt;baptized&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"British%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; (on 4 May 1884) by &lt;a href=\"The%20Reverend\"&gt;Rev.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Robert%20Hager\"&gt;C. R. Hager&lt;/a&gt; an American missionary of the Congregational Church of the United States (&lt;a href=\"American%20Board%20of%20Commissioners%20for%20Foreign%20Missions\"&gt;ABCFM&lt;/a&gt;) to his brother's disdain. The minister would also develop a friendship with Sun. Sun attended To Tsai Church (), founded by the &lt;a href=\"London%20Missionary%20Society\"&gt;London Missionary Society&lt;/a&gt; in 1888, while he studied Western Medicine in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20College%20of%20Medicine%20for%20Chinese\"&gt;Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese&lt;/a&gt;. Sun pictured a revolution as similar to the salvation mission of the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20church\"&gt;Christian church&lt;/a&gt;. His conversion to Christianity was related to his revolutionary ideals and push for advancement.\nTransformation into a revolutionary.\nFour Bandits.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Qing%20dynasty\"&gt;Qing-dynasty&lt;/a&gt; rebellion around 1888, Sun was in Hong Kong with a group of revolutionary thinkers who were nicknamed the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Bandits\"&gt;Four Bandits&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20College%20of%20Medicine%20for%20Chinese\"&gt;Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese&lt;/a&gt;. Sun, who had grown &lt;a href=\"Anti-Qing%20sentiment\"&gt;increasingly frustrated&lt;/a&gt; by the conservative Qing government and its refusal to adopt knowledge from the more technologically advanced Western nations, quit his medical practice in order to devote his time to transforming China.\nFuren and Revive China Society.\nIn 1891, Sun met revolutionary friends in Hong Kong including &lt;a href=\"Yeung%20Ku-wan\"&gt;Yeung Ku-wan&lt;/a&gt; who was the leader and founder of the &lt;a href=\"Furen%20Literary%20Society\"&gt;Furen Literary Society&lt;/a&gt;. The group was spreading the idea of overthrowing the Qing. In 1894, Sun wrote an 8,000 character petition to Qing &lt;a href=\"Viceroy%20of%20Zhili\"&gt;Viceroy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Li%20Hongzhang\"&gt;Li Hongzhang&lt;/a&gt; presenting his ideas for modernizing China. He traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tianjin\"&gt;Tianjin&lt;/a&gt; to personally present the petition to Li but was not granted an audience. After this experience, Sun turned irrevocably toward revolution. He left China for Hawaii and founded the &lt;a href=\"Revive%20China%20Society\"&gt;Revive China Society&lt;/a&gt;, which was committed to revolutionizing China's prosperity. Members were drawn mainly from Chinese expatriates, especially the lower social classes. The same month in 1894 the Furen Literary Society was merged with the Hong Kong chapter of the Revive China Society. Thereafter, Sun became the secretary of the newly merged Revive China society, which Yeung Ku-wan headed as president. They disguised their activities in Hong Kong under the running of a business under the name \"Kuen Hang Club\" ().\nFirst Sino-Japanese War.\nIn 1895, China suffered a serious defeat during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Sino-Japanese%20War\"&gt;First Sino-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt;. There were two types of responses. One group of intellectuals contended that the &lt;a href=\"Manchu\"&gt;Manchu&lt;/a&gt; Qing government could restore its legitimacy by successfully modernizing. Stressing that overthrowing the Manchu would result in chaos and would lead to China being carved up by imperialists, intellectuals like &lt;a href=\"Kang%20Youwei\"&gt;Kang Youwei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liang%20Qichao\"&gt;Liang Qichao&lt;/a&gt; supported responding with initiatives like the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Days%27%20Reform\"&gt;Hundred Days' Reform&lt;/a&gt;. In another faction, Sun Yat-sen and others like &lt;a href=\"Zou%20Rong\"&gt;Zou Rong&lt;/a&gt; wanted a revolution to replace the dynastic system with a modern nation-state in the form of a republic. The Hundred Days' reform turned out to be a failure by 1898.\nFrom uprising to exile.\nFirst Guangzhou uprising.\nIn th second year of the establishment of the Revive China society on 26 October 1895, the group planned and launched the &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution%23First%20Guangzhou%20Uprising\"&gt;First Guangzhou uprising&lt;/a&gt; against the Qing in &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Yeung%20Ku-wan\"&gt;Yeung Ku-wan&lt;/a&gt; directed the uprising starting from Hong Kong. However, plans were leaked out and more than 70 members, including &lt;a href=\"Lu%20Haodong\"&gt;Lu Haodong&lt;/a&gt;, were captured by the Qing government. The uprising was a failure. Sun received financial support mostly from his brother who sold most of his 12,000 acres of ranch and cattle in Hawaii. Additionally, members of his family and relatives of Sun would take refuge at the home of his brother Sun Mei at Kamaole in &lt;a href=\"Kula%2C%20Hawaii\"&gt;Kula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maui\"&gt;Maui&lt;/a&gt;.\nExile in Japan.\nSun Yat-sen spent time living in Japan while in exile. He was supported by the Japanese politician &lt;a href=\"T%C5%8Dten%20Miyazaki\"&gt;T\u014dten Miyazaki&lt;/a&gt;. Most Japanese who actively worked with Sun were motivated by a &lt;a href=\"Pan-Asianism\"&gt;pan-Asian&lt;/a&gt; opposition to &lt;a href=\"Western%20imperialism%20in%20Asia\"&gt;Western imperialism&lt;/a&gt;. While in Japan, Sun also met and befriended &lt;a href=\"Mariano%20Ponce\"&gt;Mariano Ponce&lt;/a&gt;, then a diplomat of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Philippine%20Republic\"&gt;First Philippine Republic&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Revolution\"&gt;Philippine Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Filipino-American War&lt;/a&gt;, Sun helped Ponce procure weapons salvaged from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Army\"&gt;Japanese military&lt;/a&gt; and ship the weapons to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Philippine%20Republic\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. By helping the Philippine Republic, Sun hoped that the Filipinos would win their independence so that he could use the archipelago as a staging point of another revolution. However, as the war ended in July 1902, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; emerged victorious from a bitter 3-year war against the Republic. Therefore, the Filipino dream of independence vanished with Sun's hopes of allying with the Philippines in his revolution in China.\nHuizhou uprising in China.\nOn 22 October 1900, Sun launched the &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution%23Huizhou%20Uprising\"&gt;Huizhou uprising&lt;/a&gt; to attack &lt;a href=\"Huizhou\"&gt;Huizhou&lt;/a&gt; and provincial authorities in Guangdong. This came five years after the failed Guangzhou uprising. This time, Sun appealed to the &lt;a href=\"Triad%20%28organized%20crime%29\"&gt;triads&lt;/a&gt; for help. This uprising was also a failure. Miyazaki, who participated in the revolt with Sun, wrote an account of this revolutionary effort under the title \"33-year dream\" () in 1902.\nFurther exile.\nSun was in exile not only in Japan but also in Europe, the United States, and Canada. He raised money for his revolutionary party and to support uprisings in China. While the events leading up to it are unclear, in 1896 Sun Yat-sen was detained at the &lt;a href=\"Embassy%20of%20China%2C%20London\"&gt;Chinese Legation in London&lt;/a&gt;, where the Chinese Imperial secret service planned to smuggle him back to China to execute him for his revolutionary actions. He was released after 12 days through the efforts of &lt;a href=\"James%20Cantlie\"&gt;James Cantlie&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Globe%20%28London%20newspaper%29\"&gt;The Globe&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times\"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;\", and the &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Office\"&gt;Foreign Office&lt;/a&gt;; leaving Sun a hero in Britain. James Cantlie, Sun's former teacher at the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, maintained a lifelong friendship with Sun and would later write an early biography of Sun. Sun wrote a book in 1897 about his detention, titled \"Kidnapped in London\".\nHeaven and Earth Society, overseas travel.\nA \"Heaven and Earth Society\" sect known as &lt;a href=\"Tiandihui\"&gt;Tiandihui&lt;/a&gt; had been around for a long time. The group has also been referred to as the \"three cooperating organizations\" as well as the &lt;a href=\"Triad%20society\"&gt;triads&lt;/a&gt;. Sun Yat-sen mainly used this group to leverage his overseas travels to gain further financial and resource support for his revolution. According to the New York Times \"Sun Yat-sen left his village in Guangdong, southern China, in 1879 to join a brother in Hawaii. He eventually returned to China and from there moved to the &lt;a href=\"British%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;British colony of Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; in 1883. It was there that he received his Western education, his Christian faith and the money for revolution.\" This is where Sun Yat-sen realized that China needed to change its ways. He knew that the only way that China would change and modernize would be to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.\nAccording to Lee Yun-ping, chairman of the Chinese historical society, Sun needed a certificate to enter the United States at a time when the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20of%201882\"&gt;Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882&lt;/a&gt; would have otherwise blocked him. However, on Sun's first attempt to enter the US, he was still arrested. He was later bailed out after 17 days. In March 1904, while residing in &lt;a href=\"Kula%2C%20Hawaii\"&gt;Kula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maui\"&gt;Maui&lt;/a&gt;, Sun Yat-sen obtained a Certificate of Hawaiian Birth, issued by the &lt;a href=\"Territory%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;Territory of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, stating that \"he was born in the &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20Islands\"&gt;Hawaiian Islands&lt;/a&gt; on the 24th day of November, A.D. 1870.\" He renounced it after it served its purpose to circumvent the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Official files of the United States show that Sun had United States nationality, moved to China with his family at age 4, and returned to Hawaii 10 years later.\nRevolution.\nTongmenghui.\nIn 1904, Sun Yat-sen came about with the goal \"to expel the &lt;a href=\"Tatar\"&gt;Tatar&lt;/a&gt; barbarians (specifically, the &lt;a href=\"Manchu\"&gt;Manchu&lt;/a&gt;), to revive &lt;a href=\"Names%20of%20China%23Zhongguo%20and%20Zhonghua\"&gt;Zhonghua&lt;/a&gt;, to establish a Republic, and to &lt;a href=\"Land%20reform\"&gt;distribute land&lt;/a&gt; equally among the people\" (). One of Sun's major legacies was the creation of his political philosophy of the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Principles%20of%20the%20People\"&gt;Three Principles of the People&lt;/a&gt;. These Principles included the principle of nationalism (minzu, ), of democracy (minquan, ), and of welfare (minsheng, ).\nOn 20 August 1905, Sun joined forces with revolutionary Chinese students studying in Tokyo to form the unified group &lt;a href=\"Tongmenghui\"&gt;Tongmenghui&lt;/a&gt; (United League), which sponsored uprisings in China. By 1906 the number of Tongmenghui members reached 963.\nMalaya support.\nSun's notability and popularity extends beyond the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20China\"&gt;Greater China&lt;/a&gt; region, particularly to &lt;a href=\"Nanyang%20%28geographical%20region%29\"&gt;Nanyang&lt;/a&gt; (Southeast Asia), where a large concentration of &lt;a href=\"overseas%20Chinese\"&gt;overseas Chinese&lt;/a&gt; resided in &lt;a href=\"British%20Malaya\"&gt;Malaya&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and Singapore). While in Singapore, he met local Chinese merchants Teo Eng Hock (), Tan Chor Nam () and Lim Nee Soon (), which mark the commencement of direct support from the Nanyang Chinese. The Singapore chapter of the Tongmenghui was established on 6 April 1906, though some records claim the founding date to be end of 1905. The &lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt; used by Sun was known as &lt;a href=\"Wan%20Qing%20Yuan\"&gt;Wan Qing Yuan&lt;/a&gt;. At this point Singapore was the headquarters of the Tongmenghui.\nThus, after founding the Tong Meng Hui, Sun advocated the establishment of The Chong Shing Yit Pao as the alliance's mouthpiece to promote revolutionary ideas. Later, he initiated the establishment of reading clubs across Singapore and Malaysia, in order to disseminate revolutionary ideas among the lower class through public readings of newspaper stories. The United Chinese Library, founded on 8 August 1910, was one such reading club, first set up at leased property on the second floor of the Wan He Salt Traders in North Boat Quay.\nThe first actual United Chinese Library building was built between 1908 and 1911 below Fort Canning \u2013 51 Armenian Street, commenced operations in 1912. The library was set up as a part of the 50 reading rooms by the Chinese Republicans to serve as an information station and liaison point for the revolutionaries. In 1987, the library was moved to its present site at Cantonment Road. But the Armenian Street building is still intact with the plaque at its entrance with Sun Yat Sen's words. With an initial membership of over 400, the library has about 180 members today. Although the United Chinese Library, with 102 years of history, was not the only reading club in Singapore during the time, today it is the only one of its kind remaining.\nSiamese support.\nIn 1903, Sun made a secret trip to &lt;a href=\"Bangkok\"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; in which he sought funds for his cause in Southeast Asia. His loyal followers published newspapers, providing invaluable support to the dissemination of his revolutionary principles and ideals among &lt;a href=\"Thai%20Chinese\"&gt;Chinese descent&lt;/a&gt; in Thailand. In Bangkok, Sun visited &lt;a href=\"Yaowarat%20Road\"&gt;Yaowarat Road&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Bangkok%27s%20Chinatown\"&gt;Bangkok's Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. It was on this street that Sun gave a speech claiming that overseas Chinese were \"the Mother of the Revolution\". He also met local Chinese merchants Seow Houtseng, whose sent financial support to him.\nSun's speech on Yaowarat street was commemorated by the street later being named \"Sun Yat Sen Street\" or \"Soi Sun Yat Sen\" () in his honour.\nZhennanguan uprising.\nOn 1 December 1907, Sun led the &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution%23Zhennanguan%20Uprising\"&gt;Zhennanguan uprising&lt;/a&gt; against the Qing at &lt;a href=\"Friendship%20Pass\"&gt;Friendship Pass&lt;/a&gt;, which is the border between &lt;a href=\"Guangxi\"&gt;Guangxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;. The uprising failed after seven days of fighting. In 1907 there were a total of four uprisings that failed including &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution%23Huanggang%20Uprising\"&gt;Huanggang uprising&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution%23Huizhou%20Qin%C3%BChu%20Uprising\"&gt;Huizhou seven women lake uprising&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution%23Qinzhou%20Uprising\"&gt;Qinzhou uprising&lt;/a&gt;. In 1908 two more uprisings failed one after another including &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution%23Qin-lian%20Uprising\"&gt;Qin-lian uprising&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution%23Hekou%20Uprising\"&gt;Hekou uprising&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnti-Sun factionalism.\nBecause of these failures, Sun's leadership was challenged by elements from within the Tongmenghui who wished to remove him as leader. In Tokyo 1907\u20131908 members from the recently merged &lt;a href=\"Guangfuhui\"&gt;Restoration society&lt;/a&gt; raised doubts about Sun's credentials. Tao Chengzhang () and &lt;a href=\"Zhang%20Binglin\"&gt;Zhang Binglin&lt;/a&gt; publicly denounced Sun with an open leaflet called \"A declaration of Sun Yat-sen's criminal acts by the revolutionaries in Southeast Asia\". This was printed and distributed in reformist newspapers like Nanyang Zonghui Bao. Their goal was to target Sun as a leader leading a revolt for &lt;a href=\"profiteering%20%28business%29\"&gt;profiteering&lt;/a&gt; gains.\nThe revolutionaries were polarized and split between pro-Sun and anti-Sun camps. Sun publicly fought off comments about how he had something to gain financially from the revolution. However, by 19 July 1910, the Tongmenghui headquarters had to relocate from Singapore to &lt;a href=\"Penang\"&gt;Penang&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the anti-Sun activities. It is also in Penang that Sun and his supporters would launch the first Chinese \"daily\" newspaper, the &lt;a href=\"Kwong%20Wah%20Yit%20Poh\"&gt;Kwong Wah Yit Poh&lt;/a&gt; in December 1910.\n1911 revolution.\nTo sponsor more uprisings, Sun made a personal plea for financial aid at the &lt;a href=\"1910%20Penang%20conference\"&gt;Penang conference&lt;/a&gt; held on 13 November 1910 in &lt;a href=\"British%20Malaya\"&gt;Malaya&lt;/a&gt;. The high-powered Preparatory Meeting of Dr. Sun Yat Sen's supporters was subsequently held in Ipoh - at the villa of Teh Lay Seng, chairman of Tungmenghui Ipoh at Jalan Sungai Pari - to raise funds for the Huanghuagang Uprising, a.k.a. the Yellow Flower Mound Uprising. The Ipoh leaders were Teh Lay Seng, Wong I Ek, Lee Guan Swee and Lee Hau Cheong. The leaders launched a major drive for donations across the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20Peninsula\"&gt;Malay Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. They raised &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20dollar\"&gt;HK$&lt;/a&gt;187,000.\nOn 27 April 1911, revolutionary &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Xing\"&gt;Huang Xing&lt;/a&gt; led a second Guangzhou uprising known as the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Flower%20Mound%20revolt\"&gt;Yellow Flower Mound revolt&lt;/a&gt; against the Qing. The revolt failed and ended in disaster; the bodies of only 72 revolutionaries were found. The revolutionaries are remembered as &lt;a href=\"Martyrdom%20in%20Chinese%20culture\"&gt;martyrs&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 10 October 1911, a military &lt;a href=\"Wuchang%20Uprising\"&gt;uprising at Wuchang&lt;/a&gt; took place led again by &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Xing\"&gt;Huang Xing&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Sun had no direct involvement as he was still in exile. Huang was in charge of the revolution that ended over 2000 years of imperial rule in China. When Sun learned of the successful rebellion against the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20emperors%20of%20the%20Qing%20Dynasty\"&gt;Qing emperor&lt;/a&gt; from press reports, he returned to China from the United States accompanied by his closest foreign advisor, the American, \"General\" &lt;a href=\"Homer%20Lea\"&gt;Homer Lea&lt;/a&gt;. He met Lea in London, where he and Lea unsuccessfully tried to arrange British financing for the new Chinese republic. Sun and Lea then sailed for China, arriving there on 21 December 1911.\nThe uprising expanded to the &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution\"&gt;Xinhai Revolution&lt;/a&gt; also known as the \"Chinese Revolution\" to overthrow the last Emperor &lt;a href=\"Puyi\"&gt;Puyi&lt;/a&gt;. After this event, 10 October became known as the commemoration of &lt;a href=\"Double%20Ten%20Day\"&gt;Double Ten Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nRepublic of China with multiple governments.\nProvisional government.\nOn 29 December 1911 a meeting of representatives from provinces in &lt;a href=\"Nanjing\"&gt;Nanking (Nanjing)&lt;/a&gt; elected Sun Yat-sen as the \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20leaders%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;provisional president&lt;/a&gt;\" (). 1 January 1912 was set as the &lt;a href=\"Epoch%20%28reference%20date%29\"&gt;first day&lt;/a&gt; of the First Year of the Republic. &lt;a href=\"Li%20Yuanhong\"&gt;Li Yuanhong&lt;/a&gt; was made provisional vice-president and &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Xing\"&gt;Huang Xing&lt;/a&gt; became the minister of the army. The new &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20Government%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%29\"&gt;Provisional Government of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; was created along with the &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20Constitution%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. Sun is credited for the funding of the revolutions and for keeping the spirit of revolution alive, even after a series of failed uprisings. His successful merger of minor revolutionary groups to a single larger party provided a better base for all those who shared the same ideals. A number of things were introduced such as the &lt;a href=\"Minguo%20calendar\"&gt;republic calendar system&lt;/a&gt; and new fashion like &lt;a href=\"Mao%20suit\"&gt;Zhongshan suits&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeiyang government.\n&lt;a href=\"Yuan%20Shikai\"&gt;Yuan Shikai&lt;/a&gt;, who controlled the &lt;a href=\"Beiyang%20Army\"&gt;Beiyang Army&lt;/a&gt;, the military of northern China, was promised the position of President of the Republic of China if he could get the Qing court to abdicate. On 12 February 1912 Emperor Puyi did abdicate the throne. Sun stepped down as President, and Yuan became the new provisional president in Beijing on 10 March 1912. The provisional government did not have any military forces of its own. Its control over elements of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Army\"&gt;New Army&lt;/a&gt; that had mutinied was limited and there were still significant forces which still had not declared against the Qing.\nSun Yat-sen sent telegrams to the leaders of all provinces requesting them to elect and to establish the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;National Assembly of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; in 1912. In May 1912 the legislative assembly moved from Nanjing to Beijing with its 120 members divided between members of &lt;a href=\"Tongmenghui\"&gt;Tongmenghui&lt;/a&gt; and a Republican party that supported Yuan Shikai. Many revolutionary members were already alarmed by Yuan's ambitions and the northern based &lt;a href=\"Beiyang%20government\"&gt;Beiyang government&lt;/a&gt;.\nNationalist party and Second Revolution.\nTongmenghui member &lt;a href=\"Song%20Jiaoren\"&gt;Song Jiaoren&lt;/a&gt; quickly tried to control the parliament. He mobilized the old Tongmenghui at the core with the merger of a number of new small parties to form a new political party called the &lt;a href=\"Guomindang\"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; (Chinese nationalist party, commonly abbreviated as \"KMT\") on 25 August 1912 at &lt;a href=\"Huguang%20Guild%20Hall\"&gt;Huguang Guild Hall&lt;/a&gt; Beijing. The &lt;a href=\"1912%20Republic%20of%20China%20National%20Assembly%20elections\"&gt;1912\u20131913 National assembly election&lt;/a&gt; was considered a huge success for the KMT winning 269 of the 596 seats in the lower house and 123 of the 274 senate seats. In retaliation the national party leader Song Jiaoren was assassinated, almost certainly by a secret order of Yuan, on 20 March 1913. The &lt;a href=\"Second%20Revolution%20%28China%29\"&gt;Second Revolution&lt;/a&gt; took place where Sun and KMT military forces tried to overthrow Yuan's forces of about 80,000 men in an armed conflict in July 1913. The revolt against Yuan was unsuccessful. In August 1913, Sun Yat-sen fled to Japan, where he later enlisted financial aid via politician and industrialist &lt;a href=\"Fusanosuke%20Kuhara\"&gt;Fusanosuke Kuhara&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical chaos.\nIn 1915 Yuan Shikai proclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20China%20%281915%E2%80%931916%29\"&gt;Empire of China&lt;/a&gt; with himself as &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20of%20China\"&gt;Emperor of China&lt;/a&gt;. Sun took part in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Protection%20War\"&gt;Anti-Monarchy war&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20Protection%20Movement\"&gt;Constitutional Protection Movement&lt;/a&gt;, while also supporting bandit leaders like &lt;a href=\"Bai%20Lang%20Rebellion\"&gt;Bai Lang&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Bai%20Lang%20Rebellion\"&gt;Bai Lang Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. This marked the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Era\"&gt;Warlord Era&lt;/a&gt;. In 1915 Sun wrote to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20International\"&gt;Second International&lt;/a&gt;, a socialist-based organization in Paris, asking it to send a team of specialists to help China set up the world's first socialist republic. At the time there were &lt;a href=\"Federalism%20in%20China\"&gt;many theories and proposals&lt;/a&gt; of what China could be. In the political mess, both Sun Yat-sen and &lt;a href=\"Xu%20Shichang\"&gt;Xu Shichang&lt;/a&gt; were announced as President of the Republic of China.\nPath to Northern Expedition.\nGuangzhou militarist government.\nChina had become divided among regional military leaders. Sun saw the danger of this and returned to China in 1916 to advocate &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20reunification%20%281928%29\"&gt;Chinese reunification&lt;/a&gt;. In 1921 he started a self-proclaimed military government in &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt; and was elected &lt;a href=\"Da%20Yuan%20Shuai\"&gt;Grand Marshal&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1912 and 1927 three governments had been set up in South China: the &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20Government%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%29\"&gt;Provisional government in Nanjing (1912)&lt;/a&gt;, the Military government in Guangzhou (1921\u20131925), and the National government in Guangzhou and later &lt;a href=\"Wuhan\"&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt; (1925\u20131927). The government in the South was established to rival the Beiyang government in the north. Yuan Shikai had banned the KMT. The short lived &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Revolutionary%20Party\"&gt;Chinese Revolutionary Party&lt;/a&gt; was a temporary replacement for the KMT. On 10 October 1919 Sun resurrected the KMT with the new name &lt;a href=\"Names%20of%20China\"&gt;Chung-kuo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt;, or the \"Nationalist Party of China\".\nKMT\u2013CPC cooperation.\nBy this time Sun had become convinced that the only hope for a unified China lay in a military conquest from his base in the south, followed by a period of political tutelage that would culminate in the transition to democracy. In order to hasten the conquest of China, he began a policy of active cooperation with the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20China\"&gt;Communist Party of China&lt;/a&gt; (CPC). Sun and the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Adolph%20Joffe\"&gt;Adolph Joffe&lt;/a&gt; signed the &lt;a href=\"Sun-Joffe%20Manifesto\"&gt;Sun-Joffe Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; in January 1923. Sun received help from the &lt;a href=\"Comintern\"&gt;Comintern&lt;/a&gt; for his acceptance of communist members into his KMT. Revolutionary and socialist leader &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Lenin\"&gt;Vladimir Lenin&lt;/a&gt; praised Sun and the KMT for their ideology and principles. Lenin praised Sun and his attempts at social reformation, and also congratulated him for fighting foreign imperialism. Sun also returned the praise, calling him a \"great man\", and sent his congratulations on the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;revolution in Russia&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Soviets' help, Sun was able to develop the military power needed for the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Expedition%20%281926%E2%80%931927%29\"&gt;Northern Expedition&lt;/a&gt; against the military at the north. He established the &lt;a href=\"Whampoa%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;Whampoa Military Academy&lt;/a&gt; near Guangzhou with &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"commandant\"&gt;commandant&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Revolutionary%20Army\"&gt;National Revolutionary Army&lt;/a&gt; (NRA). Other Whampoa leaders include &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Jingwei\"&gt;Wang Jingwei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hu%20Hanmin\"&gt;Hu Hanmin&lt;/a&gt; as political instructors. This full collaboration was called the &lt;a href=\"First%20United%20Front\"&gt;First United Front&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinance concerns.\nIn 1924 Sun appointed his brother-in-law &lt;a href=\"T.%20V.%20Soong\"&gt;T. V. Soong&lt;/a&gt; to set up the first Chinese Central bank called the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Bank%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China%20%28Taiwan%29\"&gt;Canton Central Bank&lt;/a&gt;. To establish national capitalism and a banking system was a major objective for the KMT. However Sun was not without some opposition as there was the &lt;a href=\"Canton%20Merchant%20Volunteers%20Corps%20Uprising\"&gt;Canton volunteers corps uprising&lt;/a&gt; against him.\nFinal speeches.\nIn February 1923 Sun made a presentation to the &lt;a href=\"Students%27%20Union\"&gt;Students' Union&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20University\"&gt;Hong Kong University&lt;/a&gt; and declared that it was the corruption of China and the &lt;a href=\"peace%2C%20order%20and%20good%20government\"&gt;peace, order and good government&lt;/a&gt; of Hong Kong that turned him into a revolutionary. This same year, he delivered a speech in which he proclaimed his &lt;a href=\"Three%20Principles%20of%20the%20People\"&gt;Three Principles of the People&lt;/a&gt; as the foundation of the country and the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Five-Yuan Constitution&lt;/a&gt; as the guideline for the political system and bureaucracy. Part of the speech was made into the &lt;a href=\"National%20Anthem%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;National Anthem of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 10 November 1924, Sun traveled north to &lt;a href=\"Tianjin\"&gt;Tianjin&lt;/a&gt; and delivered a speech to suggest a gathering for a \"national conference\" for the Chinese people. It called for the end of warlord rules and the abolition of all &lt;a href=\"unequal%20treaties\"&gt;unequal treaties&lt;/a&gt; with the Western powers. Two days later, he traveled to Beijing to discuss the future of the country, despite his deteriorating health and the ongoing civil war of the warlords. Among the people he met was the Muslim General &lt;a href=\"Ma%20Fuxiang\"&gt;Ma Fuxiang&lt;/a&gt;, who informed Sun that they would welcome his leadership. On 28 November 1924 Sun traveled to Japan and gave a at &lt;a href=\"Kobe\"&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt;, Japan.\nIllness and death.\nFor many years, it was popularly believed that Sun died of &lt;a href=\"liver%20cancer\"&gt;liver cancer&lt;/a&gt;. On 26 January 1925, Sun underwent an &lt;a href=\"exploratory%20laparotomy\"&gt;exploratory laparotomy&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Peking%20Union%20Medical%20College\"&gt;Peking Union Medical College&lt;/a&gt; Hospital (PUMCH) to investigate a long-term illness. This was performed by the head of the Department of Surgery, Adrian S. Taylor, who stated that the procedure \"revealed extensive involvement of the liver by &lt;a href=\"carcinoma\"&gt;carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;\" and that Sun only had about ten days to live. Sun was hospitalized and his condition was treated with &lt;a href=\"radium\"&gt;radium&lt;/a&gt;. Sun survived the initial ten-day period and on 18 February, against the advice of doctors, he was transferred to the KMT headquarters and treated with &lt;a href=\"traditional%20Chinese%20medicine\"&gt;traditional Chinese medicine&lt;/a&gt;. This too was unsuccessful and he died on 12 March at the age of 58. Contemporary reports in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;\", and the Chinese newspaper \"Qun Qiang Bao\" all reported the cause of death as liver cancer, based on Taylor's observation.\nFollowing this the body then was preserved in mineral oil and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Azure%20Clouds\"&gt;Temple of Azure Clouds&lt;/a&gt;, a Buddhist shrine in the Western Hills a few miles outside of Beijing. He also left a () penned by &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Jingwei\"&gt;Wang Jingwei&lt;/a&gt;, which had a widespread influence in the subsequent development of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%9349%29\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1926, construction began on a majestic mausoleum at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Mountain%20%28Nanjing%29\"&gt;Purple Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in Nanjing, and this was completed in the spring of 1929. On 1 June 1929, Sun's remains were moved from Beijing and interred in the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yat-sen%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy pure chance, in May 2016, an American pathologist named Rolf F. Barth was visiting the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yat-sen%20Memorial%20Hall%20%28Guangzhou%29\"&gt;Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt; when he noticed a faded copy of the original autopsy report on display. The autopsy was performed immediately after Sun's death by James Cash, a pathologist at PUMCH. Based on a &lt;a href=\"Sampling%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;tissue sample&lt;/a&gt;, Cash concluded that the cause of death was an &lt;a href=\"adenocarcinoma\"&gt;adenocarcinoma&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"gallbladder\"&gt;gallbladder&lt;/a&gt; that had &lt;a href=\"Metastasis\"&gt;metastasized&lt;/a&gt; to the liver. In modern China, liver cancer is far more common than gallbladder cancer and although the incidence rates of either in 1925 are not known, if one assumes that they were similar at that time, then the original diagnosis by Taylor was a logical conclusion. From the time of Sun's death until the appearance of Barth's report in the \"&lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Journal%20of%20Cancer\"&gt;Chinese Journal of Cancer&lt;/a&gt;\" in September 2016 (now known as \"Cancer Communications\" since 1 March 2018), the true cause of death of Sun Yat-sen was not reported in any English-language publication. Even in Chinese-language sources, it only appeared in one non-medical online report in 2013.\nLegacy.\nPower struggle.\nAfter Sun's death, a power struggle between his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt; and his old revolutionary comrade &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Jingwei\"&gt;Wang Jingwei&lt;/a&gt; split the KMT. At stake in this struggle was the right to lay claim to Sun's ambiguous legacy. In 1927 Chiang Kai-shek married &lt;a href=\"Soong%20Mei-ling\"&gt;Soong Mei-ling&lt;/a&gt;, a sister of Sun's widow &lt;a href=\"Soong%20Ching-ling\"&gt;Soong Ching-ling&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently he could claim to be a brother-in-law of Sun. When the &lt;a href=\"12%20April%20Incident\"&gt;Communists and the Kuomintang split&lt;/a&gt; in 1927, marking the start of the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Chinese Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, each group claimed to be his true heirs, a conflict that continued through World War II. Sun's widow, &lt;a href=\"Soong%20Ching-ling\"&gt;Soong Ching-ling&lt;/a&gt;, sided with the Communists during the Chinese Civil War and served from 1949 to 1981 as Vice-President (or Vice-Chairwoman) of the People's Republic of China and as Honorary President shortly before her death in 1981.\nCult of personality.\nA &lt;a href=\"personality%20cult\"&gt;personality cult&lt;/a&gt; in the Republic of China was centered on Sun and his successor, &lt;a href=\"Generalissimo\"&gt;Generalissimo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt;. Chinese Muslim Generals and Imams participated in this cult of personality and &lt;a href=\"One-party%20state\"&gt;one party state&lt;/a&gt;, with Muslim General &lt;a href=\"Ma%20Bufang\"&gt;Ma Bufang&lt;/a&gt; making people bow to Sun's portrait and listen to the national anthem during a &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20culture\"&gt;Tibetan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mongol\"&gt;Mongol&lt;/a&gt; religious ceremony for the &lt;a href=\"Qinghai%20Lake\"&gt;Qinghai Lake&lt;/a&gt; God. Quotes from the &lt;a href=\"Quran\"&gt;Quran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hadith\"&gt;Hadith&lt;/a&gt; were used among &lt;a href=\"Hui%20people\"&gt;Hui&lt;/a&gt; Muslims to justify Chiang Kai-shek's rule over China.\nThe Kuomintang's constitution designated Sun as party president. After his death, the Kuomintang opted to keep that language in its constitution to honor his memory forever. The party has since been headed by a director-general (1927\u20131975) and a chairman (since 1975), which discharge the functions of the president.\nFather of the Nation.\nSun Yat-sen remains unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for having a high reputation both in &lt;a href=\"mainland%20China\"&gt;mainland China&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. In Taiwan, he is seen as the Father of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, and is known by the &lt;a href=\"posthumous%20name\"&gt;posthumous name&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Father%20of%20the%20Nation\"&gt;Father of the Nation&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Sun Zhongshan\" (, where the &lt;a href=\"Tai%20tou\"&gt;one-character space&lt;/a&gt; is a traditional homage symbol). His likeness is still almost always found in ceremonial locations such as in front of legislatures and classrooms of public &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20Taiwan\"&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt;, from elementary to senior high school, and he continues to appear in new &lt;a href=\"New%20Taiwan%20dollar\"&gt;coinage and currency&lt;/a&gt;.\nForerunner of the revolution.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"mainland%20China\"&gt;mainland&lt;/a&gt;, Sun is seen as a Chinese nationalist, proto-socialist, first president of a Republican China and is highly regarded as the Forerunner of the Revolution (). He is even mentioned by name in the to the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Constitution of the People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years, the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20China\"&gt;Communist Party of China&lt;/a&gt; has increasingly invoked Sun, partly as a way of bolstering &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20nationalism\"&gt;Chinese nationalism&lt;/a&gt; in light of &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20economic%20reform\"&gt;Chinese economic reform&lt;/a&gt; and partly to increase connections with supporters of the Kuomintang on Taiwan which the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;PRC&lt;/a&gt; sees as allies against &lt;a href=\"Taiwan%20independence\"&gt;Taiwan independence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yat-sen%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Sun's tomb&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first stops made by the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the &lt;a href=\"People%20First%20Party%20%28Republic%20of%20China%29\"&gt;People First Party&lt;/a&gt; on their &lt;a href=\"2005%20Pan-Blue%20visits%20to%20mainland%20China\"&gt;pan-blue visit to mainland China in 2005&lt;/a&gt;. A massive portrait of Sun continues to appear in &lt;a href=\"Tiananmen%20Square\"&gt;Tiananmen Square&lt;/a&gt; for May Day and &lt;a href=\"National%20Day%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;National Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomic development.\nSun Yat-sen spent years in Hawaii as a student in the late 1870s and early 1880s, and was highly impressed with the economic development he saw there. He used the independent Kingdom of Hawaii as a model to develop his vision of a technologically modern and politically independent and actively &lt;a href=\"Anti-imperialism\"&gt;anti-imperialist&lt;/a&gt; China. Sun Yat-sen was an important pioneer of international development, proposing in the 1920s international institutions of the sort that appeared after World War II. He focused on China, with its vast potential and weak base of mostly local entrepreneurs. \nHis key proposal was socialism. He proposed:\nFamily.\nSun Yat-sen was born to Sun Dacheng () and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Yang\"&gt;Lady Yang&lt;/a&gt; () on 12 November 1866. At the time his father was age 53, while his mother was 38 years old. He had an older brother, Sun Dezhang (), and an older sister, Sun Jinxing (), who died at the early age of 4. Another older brother, Sun Deyou (), died at the age of 6. He also had an older sister, Sun Miaoqian (), and a younger sister, Sun Qiuqi ().\nAt age 20, Sun had an &lt;a href=\"arranged%20marriage\"&gt;arranged marriage&lt;/a&gt; with fellow villager &lt;a href=\"Lu%20Muzhen\"&gt;Lu Muzhen&lt;/a&gt;.
