    "text": "The Union of Greens and Farmers (, ZZS) is an &lt;a href=\"agrarianism\"&gt;agrarian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"political%20alliance\"&gt;political alliance&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;. It is made up of the &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20Farmers%27%20Union\"&gt;Latvian Farmers' Union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20Green%20Party\"&gt;Latvian Green Party&lt;/a&gt; and it closely cooperates with &lt;a href=\"For%20Latvia%20and%20Ventspils\"&gt;For Latvia and Ventspils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liep%C4%81ja%20Party\"&gt;Liep\u0101ja Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is positioned in the &lt;a href=\"Centrism\"&gt;centre&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Centre-right%20politics\"&gt;centre-right&lt;/a&gt; on the political spectrum. It is orientated towards &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Euroscepticism\"&gt;soft Eurosceptic&lt;/a&gt; policies, and &lt;a href=\"green%20politics\"&gt;green politics&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be considered a centrist &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20agrarian\"&gt;Nordic agrarian&lt;/a&gt; alliance, with &lt;a href=\"Nationalism\"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anti-liberal\"&gt;anti-liberal&lt;/a&gt; elements.\nWhile the alliance's formal leader is &lt;a href=\"Edgars%20Tavars\"&gt;Edgars Tavars&lt;/a&gt;, its leading figure and chief financial supporter is the oligarch &lt;a href=\"Aivars%20Lembergs\"&gt;Aivars Lembergs&lt;/a&gt;. The ZZS has had the world's first prime minister, &lt;a href=\"Indulis%20Emsis\"&gt;Indulis Emsis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Latvia\"&gt;Prime Minister of Latvia&lt;/a&gt; in 2004), and first head of state, &lt;a href=\"Raimonds%20V%C4%93jonis\"&gt;Raimonds V\u0113jonis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Latvia\"&gt;President of Latvia&lt;/a&gt; 2015\u201319), to be affiliated with a green party.\nHistory.\nThe alliance was established to contest the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Latvian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2002 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20Green%20Party\"&gt;Latvian Green Party&lt;/a&gt; (LZP) and &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20Farmers%27%20Union\"&gt;Latvian Farmers' Union&lt;/a&gt; (LZS). It ran on an ideologically amorphous agenda and won 12 out of 100 seats in the parliament. In March 2004, &lt;a href=\"Indulis%20Emsis\"&gt;Indulis Emsis&lt;/a&gt; from the LZP became the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Latvia\"&gt;Prime Minister of Latvia&lt;/a&gt; until December of that year.\nOn a European level, the LZP cooperated with the &lt;a href=\"European%20Green%20Party\"&gt;European Green Party&lt;/a&gt; while the LZS has no formal affiliation. Before the &lt;a href=\"2004%20European%20Parliament%20election%20in%20Latvia\"&gt;2004 European Parliament election&lt;/a&gt;, ZZS announced that if its representative was elected, he or she would join one of two &lt;a href=\"Political%20groups%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament\"&gt;political groups&lt;/a&gt; depending on which party they belonged to.\nThe alliance continued for the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Latvian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2006 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt;, and won 18 seats. It became part of the governing coalition, and LZP chairman &lt;a href=\"Indulis%20Emsis\"&gt;Indulis Emsis&lt;/a&gt;, who served as Prime Minister briefly in 2004, became &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20of%20the%20Saeima\"&gt;Speaker of the Saeima&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Aivars%20Lembergs\"&gt;Aivars Lembergs&lt;/a&gt; was the candidate of the Union of Greens and Farmers for the position of Prime Minister in 2006, before being charged with corruption, fraud, bribery, money laundering and abuse of elected office on 20 July 2006. On 14 March 2007, Lembergs was detained by the Latvian authorities in relation to a criminal investigation.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"2014%20European%20Parliament%20election%20in%20Latvia\"&gt;2014 European Parliament election&lt;/a&gt;, the ZZS won 8.3% of the vote and for the first time one of Latvia's European Parliament seats. Its &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament\"&gt;MEP&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Iveta%20Grigule\"&gt;Iveta Grigule&lt;/a&gt; who initially sat with the &lt;a href=\"Europe%20of%20Freedom%20and%20Direct%20Democracy\"&gt;Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy&lt;/a&gt; (EFFD) group. On 16 October 2014 Grigule defected from the EFDD to sit as an &lt;a href=\"Non-Attached%20Members\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt;. This move required EFDD to co-opt a member of Poland's &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20New%20Right\"&gt;Congress of the New Right&lt;/a&gt; to remain eligible for parliamentary group status. In April 2015 she joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats%20for%20Europe%20Group\"&gt;Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe&lt;/a&gt; (ALDE) group.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Latvian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2015 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, the alliance's then-leader &lt;a href=\"Raimonds%20V%C4%93jonis\"&gt;Raimonds V\u0113jonis&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Latvia\"&gt;President of Latvia&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently resigned his leadership of the alliance.\nIdeology.\nThe Union of Greens and Farmers is based on similar sentimental feelings shared by the voters of the two groups. Latvians are supportive of traditional small farms and perceive them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms. For example, after the &lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Restoration%20of%20Independence%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Latvia\"&gt;restoration of independence&lt;/a&gt;, Latvia broke down &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20re-occupation%20of%20Latvia%20in%201944\"&gt;Soviet-era&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kolkhoz\"&gt;collective farms&lt;/a&gt; and returned land to its original owners (or their descendants). This perception has resulted in an alliance between green and farmer's parties, which is rare in other countries.\nThe alliance is &lt;a href=\"Euroscepticism\"&gt;Eurosceptic&lt;/a&gt;, although not opposed to &lt;a href=\"2004%20enlargement%20of%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;Latvian membership of the European Union&lt;/a&gt;. The ZZS opposed the &lt;a href=\"Latvian%20euro%20coins\"&gt;adoption of the euro by Latvia&lt;/a&gt;. The party opposes granting &lt;a href=\"Non-citizens%20%28Latvia%29\"&gt;non-citizens&lt;/a&gt; Latvian citizenship or voting rights in local elections."
