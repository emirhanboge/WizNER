    "text": "Gutavallen is an outdoor &lt;a href=\"stadium\"&gt;sport stadium&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Visby\"&gt;Visby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. It was opened on 27 May 1927 and is used for &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, but occasionally the arena is also used for &lt;a href=\"concert\"&gt;concert&lt;/a&gt;s. Gutavallen is the home arena of &lt;a href=\"FC%20Gute\"&gt;FC Gute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Visby%20AIK\"&gt;Visby AIK&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stadium has two stands\u2014one on each long side\u2014with the main stand seating 550 spectators. The original main stand was &lt;a href=\"burn\"&gt;burn&lt;/a&gt;ed down in 1998, but was quickly rebuilt the following year. Gutavallen has a total spectator capacity of 5,000 \u2013 this is also the record which was set on April 1, 1995, when the football club then named &lt;a href=\"FC%20Gute\"&gt;Visby IF Gute&lt;/a&gt; took on the &lt;a href=\"Allsvenskan\"&gt;Allsvenskan&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"IFK%20G%C3%B6teborg\"&gt;IFK G\u00f6teborg&lt;/a&gt; in a game at the 1994\u201395 &lt;a href=\"Svenska%20Cupen\"&gt;Svenska Cupen&lt;/a&gt; which the away team G\u00f6teborg won 4\u20130.\nAt the time that Gutavallen originally was built, it did not have an &lt;a href=\"all-weather%20running%20track\"&gt;all-weather running track&lt;/a&gt;, which was first added in 1975. Between March and August 2013, the running track was being replaced due to the track's floor having worn out.\nGutavallen has been the venue for the &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sweden national football team&lt;/a&gt;'s training camps a couple of times; in 2006 prior to the &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; that year, as well as in 2012 prior to the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202012\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2012&lt;/a&gt; tournament. The &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sweden women's national football team&lt;/a&gt;'s training camp also took place here in August 2019, in preparation for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Women%27s%20Euro%202021%20qualifying\"&gt;UEFA Women's Euro 2021 qualifying&lt;/a&gt; competition. It was one of the main venues for the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Island%20Games\"&gt;2017 edition&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Island%20Games\"&gt;Island Games&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"ICA%20Maxi%20Arena\"&gt;ICA Maxi Arena&lt;/a&gt;."
