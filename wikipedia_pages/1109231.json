    "text": "Sir Uvedale Price, 1st Baronet (baptised 14 April 1747 \u2013 14 September 1829), author of the \"Essay on the Picturesque, As Compared with the Sublime and The Beautiful\" (1794), was a &lt;a href=\"Herefordshire\"&gt;Herefordshire&lt;/a&gt; landowner who was at the heart of the '&lt;a href=\"Picturesque\"&gt;Picturesque&lt;/a&gt; debate' of the 1790s.\nHis life.\nUvedale Price was the eldest son of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Price%20%281717%E2%80%931761%29\"&gt;Robert Price&lt;/a&gt;, an amateur artist, by his wife the Hon. Sarah Barrington, daughter of &lt;a href=\"John%20Shute%20Barrington%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Barrington\"&gt;John Shute Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington&lt;/a&gt;. Educated at &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;Christ Church, Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, Price inherited the family estate of Foxley (in &lt;a href=\"Yazor\"&gt;Yazor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Herefordshire\"&gt;Herefordshire&lt;/a&gt;) when he came of age in 1768, a few years after the death of his father in 1761 and of his grandfather (&lt;a href=\"Uvedale%20Tomkins%20Price\"&gt;Uvedale Tomkins Price&lt;/a&gt;) in 1764. As a young man Price was a figure on London's social scene, and was once described as the \"&lt;a href=\"maccaroni%20%28fashion%29\"&gt;macaroni&lt;/a&gt; of his age,\" but with his inheritance and his marriage to Lady Caroline Carpenter, youngest daughter of &lt;a href=\"George%20Carpenter%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Tyrconnel\"&gt;George Carpenter, 1st Earl of Tyrconnel&lt;/a&gt;, he settled down at Foxley to tend to the estate and develop his theories on landscape, as well as equally controversial work on the &lt;a href=\"pronunciation\"&gt;pronunciation&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Classical%20languages\"&gt;Classical languages&lt;/a&gt;. He served as &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff%20of%20Herefordshire\"&gt;High Sheriff of Herefordshire&lt;/a&gt; in 1793, and was created a baronet on 12 February 1828.\nDuring his life, Price was befriended by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20George%20Beaumont%2C%207th%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir George Beaumont&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Beaumont\"&gt;Margaret Beaumont&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he corresponded extensively. He was also a lifetime friend of the statesman &lt;a href=\"Charles%20James%20Fox\"&gt;Charles James Fox&lt;/a&gt; as well as being acquainted with &lt;a href=\"William%20Wordsworth\"&gt;William Wordsworth&lt;/a&gt;, and in later life, a correspondent of &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Barrett%20Browning\"&gt;Elizabeth Barrett Browning&lt;/a&gt;. He died in 1829, having finally printed his work on Greek and Latin pronunciation. His only son Robert succeeded as 2nd (and last) baronet.\nThe Picturesque and Landscape theory.\nPrice developed his ideas with his close neighbour &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Payne%20Knight\"&gt;Richard Payne Knight&lt;/a&gt;, whose poem 'The Landscape' was published the same year as Price's \"Essay\" delineating his theories on \"The Picturesque\" as a mode of landscape.\nWell before Price's \"Essay\" or Knight's poem, however, the term was used in early 18th century France to refer to a property of being \"in the style of a painter\". Pope, in his \"Letter to Caryll\", brought the word into English as \"picturesque\" in 1712. The term was used by various English authors throughout the 18th century (cf. \"&lt;a href=\"Oxford%20English%20Dictionary\"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;\" 'picturesque') before being described by &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Bagehot\"&gt;Bagehot&lt;/a&gt; in \"Literary Studies\" (1879) as \"a quality distinct from that of beauty, or sublimity, or grandeur.\"\nFor Price, the Picturesque was more specifically defined as being located between the &lt;a href=\"Beauty\"&gt;Beautiful&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sublime%20%28literary%29\"&gt;Sublime&lt;/a&gt;. In practical application this meant that his preferred mode of &lt;a href=\"landscaping\"&gt;landscaping&lt;/a&gt; was to retain old &lt;a href=\"trees\"&gt;trees&lt;/a&gt;, rutted paths, and textured slopes, rather than to sweep all these away in the style that had been practised by &lt;a href=\"Lancelot%20%26quot%3BCapability%26quot%3B%20Brown\"&gt;Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown&lt;/a&gt;. Price contested, for example, the obsession of \"The Beautiful\" with Classical and natural &lt;a href=\"symmetry\"&gt;symmetry&lt;/a&gt;, arguing instead for a less formal and more asymmetrical interpretation of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrice's ideas led to much debate in artistic and literary circles: they were parodied, for example, by &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Austen\"&gt;Jane Austen&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Northanger%20Abbey\"&gt;Northanger Abbey&lt;/a&gt;\". Price republished the \"Essay\" several times, with additional material, and entered into a public debate with &lt;a href=\"Humphry%20Repton\"&gt;Humphry Repton&lt;/a&gt; over the latter's approach to landscape design. He similarly fell out with Payne Knight, whose theories of landscape betrayed a more esoteric attitude."
