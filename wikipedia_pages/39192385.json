    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Terminology\"&gt;term&lt;/a&gt; \"Great Church\" () is used in the &lt;a href=\"Historiography%23Christendom\"&gt;historiography&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"early%20Christianity\"&gt;early Christianity&lt;/a&gt; to mean the period of about 180 to 313, between that of primitive Christianity and that of the legalization of the Christian religion in the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, corresponding closely to what is called the &lt;a href=\"Ante-Nicene%20Period\"&gt;Ante-Nicene Period&lt;/a&gt;. \"It has rightly been called the period of the Great Church, in view of its numerical growth, its constitutional development and its intense theological activity.\"\nIt has been defined also as meaning \"the Church as defended by such as &lt;a href=\"Ignatius%20of%20Antioch\"&gt;Ignatius of Antioch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Irenaeus%20of%20Lyons\"&gt;Irenaeus of Lyons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyprian%20of%20Carthage\"&gt;Cyprian of Carthage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Origen%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;Origen of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt; and characterized as possessing a single teaching and communion over and against the division of the sects, e.g., &lt;a href=\"gnosticism\"&gt;gnosticism&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"heresy\"&gt;heresies&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBy the beginning of the fourth century, the Great Church or, as it was also called, the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20%28term%29\"&gt;catholic&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., universal) Church, already formed about 15% of the population of the Roman Empire and was ready, both numerically and structurally, for its role as the church of the empire, becoming the &lt;a href=\"state%20church%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;state church of the Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 380. However, it would be wrong \"to over-emphasize the new externals of the Church at the expense of historical continuity\". It was still the same Church.\nRoger F. Olson says: \"According to the Roman Catholic account of the history of Christian theology, the Great Church catholic and orthodox lived on from the apostles to today in the West and all bishops that remained in fellowship with the bishop of Rome have constituted its hierarchy\"; or, as the Catholic Church itself has expressed it, \"This Church constituted and organized in the world as a society, subsists in the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, which is governed by &lt;a href=\"Pope\"&gt;the successor of Peter&lt;/a&gt; and by the Bishops in communion with him, although many elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside of its visible structure.\"\nThe unbroken continuity of the Great Church is affirmed also by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]: \"Orthodoxy regards the Great Church in antiquity (for most of the first millennium) as comprising, on one side, the Eastern Orthodox world (the Byzantine patriarchates presided over by the hierarch of the Church of Constantinople together with the Slavic Orthodox churches); and, on the other side, the Western Catholic Church, presided over by the hierarch of the Church of Rome.\"\nEmergence.\n[[File:Saint Irenaeus.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Irenaeus]] (2nd century\u00a0\u2013 )]]\nLawrence S. Cunningham, and separately, [[James Kugel|Kugel]] and Greer state that [[Irenaeus]]'s statement in \"Against Heresies\" [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter X.|Chapter X 1\u20132]] (written ) is the first recorded reference to the existence of a \"catholic Church\" with a core set of shared beliefs as opposed to the ideas of dissident groups. Irenaeus states:\nCunningham states that two points in Irenaeus' writing deserve attention. First, that Irenaeus distinguished the Church singular from \"the churches\" plural, and more importantly, Irenaeus holds that only in the larger singular Church does one find the truth handed down by the apostles of Christ.\nAt the beginning of the 3rd century the Great Church that Irenaeus and Celsus had referred to had spread across a significant portion of the world, with most of its members living in cities (see [[early centers of Christianity]]). The growth was less than uniform across the world. The \"[[Chronicle of Arbela]]\" stated that in 225\u00a0AD, there were 20 bishops in all of [[Persia]], while at approximately the same time, surrounding areas of Rome had over 60 bishops. But the Great Church of the 3rd century was not monolithic, consisting of a network of churches connected across cultural zones by lines of communication which at times included personal relationships.\nThe Great Church grew in the 2nd century and entered the 3rd century mainly in two empires: the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and the [[Persian Empire|Persian]], with the network of bishops usually acting as the cohesive element across cultural zones. In 313, the [[Edict of Milan]] ended the persecution of Christians, and by 380 the Great Church had gathered enough followers to become the [[State church of the Roman Empire]] by virtue of the [[Edict of Thessalonica]].\nHistorical references.\nIn \"[[Contra Celsum]]\" 5.59 and 5.61 the Church Father [[Origen]] mentions [[Celsus]]' late 2nd century use of the terms \"church of the multitudes\" or \"great church\" to refer to the emerging consensus traditions among Christians at the time, as Christianity was taking shape.\nIn the 4th century, as [[Saint Augustine]] commented on [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] XXII, he interpreted the term to mean the whole world, writing: \"The great Church, Brethren, what is it? Is a scanty portion of the earth the great Church? The great Church means the whole world.\" Augustine continued to expound on how various churches all considered themselves \"the great Church,\" but that only the whole world could be seen as the great Church.\nTheological underpinnings and separation.\n[[File:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Constantine I|Emperor Constantine]] and [[bishop]]s with the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed|Creed of 381]].]]\nThe epoch of the Great Church witnessed the development of key theological concepts which now form the fabric of the religious beliefs of the large majority of Christians.\nRelying on Scripture, prevailing mysticism and popular piety, [[Irenaeus]] formalized some of the [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attributes of God]], writing in \"Against Heresies\" [[Wikisource:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book IV/Chapter XIX.|Book IV, Chapter 19]]: \"His greatness lacks nothing, but contains all things.\" [[Irenaeus]] also referred to the early use of the \"Father, Son and Holy Spirit\" formula which appeared as part of Christian Creeds, writing in \"Against Heresies\" ([[Wikisource:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter X.|Book I Chapter X]]):\nAround 213\u00a0AD in \"Adversus Praxeas\" ([[Wikisource:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Anti-Marcion/Against Praxeas/III|chapter 3]]) [[Tertullian]] provided a formal representation of the concept of the [[Trinity]], i.e., that God exists as one \"substance\" but three \"Persons\": The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Tertullian also discussed how the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. The [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 and later the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381 then formalized these elements.\nIn 451, all the bishops of the Great Church were ordered to attend the [[Council of Chalcedon]] to discuss theological issues that had emerged. This turned out to be a turning point at which the [[Western Christianity|Western]] and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] churches parted ways based on seemingly small [[Christology|Christological]] differences, and began the fracturing of the claim to the term Great Church by both sides.\nModern theories on the formation of the Great Church.\nOfficial Catholic publications, and other writers, sometimes consider that the concept of the \"Great Church\" can be found already in the [[Epistles of Paul]], such as in \"This is my rule in all the churches\" ([[1 Corinthians 7:17]]) and in the [[Apostolic Fathers]] such as the letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]]. Exegesis has even located the \"ecclesia magna\" in the Latin [[Vulgate]] translations of the \"great congregation\" (\"kahal rab\") of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. This interpretation was also offered by [[Pope Benedict XVI]], and by [[Martin Luther]].\nDennis Minns (2010) considers that the concept of a \"Great Church\" was developed by polemical heresiologists such as [[Irenaeus]]. The presentation of [[early Christianity|early Christian]] unity and orthodoxy (see [[Proto-orthodox Christianity]]), and counter presentation of groups such as those sects labelled \"[[Gnostic]]\", by early heresiologists such as Irenaeus is questioned by modern historians.\n[[Roger E. Olson]] (1999) uses the term to refer to the Great Church at the time of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) when the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] and Bishop of Rome were in fellowship with each other.\nIn contrast to \"Jewish Christianity\".\nThe term is contrasted with [[Jewish Christian]]s who came to be more and more clearly separated from the Great Church. [[Wilhelm Schneemelcher]] and others writing on [[New Testament Apocrypha]] distinguish writings as being sectarian or from the Great Church.\nGabriele Waste (2005) is among German scholars using similar references, where the \"Gro\u00dfe Kirche\" (\"Great Church\") is defined as \"Ecclesia ex gentibus\" (Church of the Gentiles) in comparison to the \"Ecclesia ex circumcisione\" (Church of the Circumcision).\nIn the anglophone world, [[Bruce J. Malina]] (1976) contrasted what he calls \"Christian Judaism\" (usually termed \"[[Jewish Christianity]]\") with \"the historically perceived orthodox Christianity that undergirds the ideology of the emergent Great Church.\"\nIn francophone scholarship, the term Grande \u00c9glise (Latin: \"Ecclesia magna\") has also been equated with the \"more [[hellenize]]d\" as opposed to \"[[Judaizing]]\" sections of the early church, and the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] is seen as a definitive stage in the [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|separation between Judaism and the Christianity of the \"Grande \u00c9glise\"]]. Those stressing this binary view of early Christianity include [[Simon Claude Mimouni]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Blancheti\u00e8re]].\nReferences.\n[[Category:Ancient Christianity]]\n[[Category:Ecclesiology]]\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]"
