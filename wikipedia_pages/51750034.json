    "text": "Fiona Kumari Campbell (born 1963) is a &lt;a href=\"disability%20studies\"&gt;disability studies&lt;/a&gt; researcher and &lt;a href=\"Theory\"&gt;theorist&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on disability in relation to the &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"advocacy\"&gt;advocacy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"desire\"&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt;. She is currently Senior Lecturer In the School of Education and Social Work at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Dundee\"&gt;University of Dundee&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland. She is also an Adjunct Professor in Disability Studies with the Faculty of Medicine at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Kelaniya\"&gt;University of Kelaniya&lt;/a&gt;, Sri Lanka. Her specific research of &lt;a href=\"ableism\"&gt;ableism&lt;/a&gt; focuses on how notions of disabled and able-bodies are recited with the dominant discourse of society. In particular, her book, \"Contours of Ableism,\" attempts to challenge \"notions of what constitutes 'normal' and 'pathological' bodies\" and what truly distinguishes the \"able body\" from the \"disabled body.\"\nEarly life and influences.\nFiona Kumari Campbell was born in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, Australia, to a family of &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20people\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;n-&lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; descent and identifies as &lt;a href=\"Multiracial%20people\"&gt;biracial&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Asian%20people\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt;. Her early ideas about difference and the politics of race were developed by her own early childhood experiences of growing up under Australia\u2019s notorious &lt;a href=\"White%20Australia%20policy\"&gt;White Australia&lt;/a&gt; policy and the treatment of her Asian mother. Although her father died at the age of 33 when Campbell was nine years old, his preoccupations with the &lt;a href=\"Classics\"&gt;Classics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"theology\"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Socialism\"&gt;socialist politics&lt;/a&gt; left an indelible impression on her learning and understandings of the world. Campbell had an uneven education, leaving home at sixteen and eventually finishing her final Higher School Certificate at the &lt;a href=\"Croydon%20High%20School\"&gt;Croydon High&lt;/a&gt; Evening School in 1980 under the &lt;a href=\"Tutoring\"&gt;tutelage&lt;/a&gt; of Dr. Norman W. Saffin, who also schooled Australian sociologist &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Beilharz\"&gt;Peter Beilharz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marxist%20feminism\"&gt;Marxist-Feminist&lt;/a&gt; researcher Dr Patricia Morrigan.\nEducation.\nFiona Kumari Campbell has long been interested in the study of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20and%20political%20rights\"&gt;civil rights&lt;/a&gt; of people from marginal backgrounds. She has focused on the consequences of &lt;a href=\"discrimination\"&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oppression\"&gt;social oppression&lt;/a&gt; that affects the people in her research. Campbell is a scholar of disability studies, &lt;a href=\"sociology\"&gt;sociology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cultural%20studies\"&gt;cultural studies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jurisprudence\"&gt;legal theory&lt;/a&gt;, all of which can be found in much of her published &lt;a href=\"Academic%20discipline\"&gt;cross-disciplinary&lt;/a&gt; research. Campbell's writing relates to issues of philosophy, &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, disability, Sri Lankan disability, law, technology, and marginality.\nCampbell started her education at &lt;a href=\"La%20Trobe%20University\"&gt;La Trobe University&lt;/a&gt; attending on a part-time basis between 1987 and 1998 where she received a 1st Class &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Liberal%20Studies\"&gt;BLS&lt;/a&gt; (Hons) in Law and Sociology. In 1999 after being awarded an &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Postgraduate%20Awards\"&gt;Australian Postgraduate Award&lt;/a&gt; (APA) she returned to university where she graduated with a &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Philosophy\"&gt;PhD&lt;/a&gt; in Sociology, &lt;a href=\"Humanities\"&gt;Humanities&lt;/a&gt;, and Law from &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20University%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Queensland University of Technology&lt;/a&gt;, under the supervision of Professor Gavin Kendall. Campbell went on to receive a Certificate in Higher Research Degree Supervision in 2005 from &lt;a href=\"Griffith%20University\"&gt;Griffith University&lt;/a&gt; and in 2014 received an Advanced Diploma in Theology, &lt;a href=\"Systematic%20theology\"&gt;Systematic Theology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20liturgy\"&gt;Catholic Liturgy&lt;/a&gt;, and Buddhist Studies from MCD &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;University of Divinity&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nCampbell began her career as a &lt;a href=\"Homeless%20shelter\"&gt;shelter&lt;/a&gt; workshop employee before moving on to work in the community services sector where she focused on projects involving &lt;a href=\"poverty\"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt; and disability. Moving out of the community services sector she worked in the National Government's disability policy positions before finally settling on academia. Campbell undertook a brief stint with the Australian Benedictine religious order, the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Good%20Samaritan\"&gt;Sisters of the Good Samaritan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2003, Campbell joined &lt;a href=\"Griffith%20University\"&gt;Griffith University\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; Logan campus as the Convenor of the disabilities program in the School of Human Services and Social Work, which is considered to be Australia\u2019s largest postgraduate disabilities program. In 2009, Campbell published her first book, \"Contours of Ableism\", before leaving the School in the following year. In 2011 she took up the position of Deputy Head (Learning and Teaching Scholarship), with the Griffith Law School, holding a substantive position of &lt;a href=\"Associate%20professor\"&gt;Associate Professor&lt;/a&gt; until June 2014. In 2016, Campbell joined the Faculty of the School of Health and Wellbeing at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20Queensland\"&gt;University of Southern Queensland&lt;/a&gt; and was appointed as the &lt;a href=\"program%20director\"&gt;program director&lt;/a&gt; of human services.\nWith over 18 years of teaching experience, Campbell has taught at several universities in Australia such as Griffith University, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20University%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Victoria University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Kelaniya\"&gt;University of Kelaniya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20University%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Queensland University of Technology&lt;/a&gt;. She has taught on the subjects of human rights, diversity studies, sociological and law theory, and Australian politics and disability studies.\nIn January 2017, Campbell joined the School of &lt;a href=\"Social%20work\"&gt;Social Work&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Dundee\"&gt;University of Dundee&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland. Currently, Campbell is also working on two books \"#Ableism: An Interdisciplinary Introduction to Studies in Ableism \" and \"Textures of Ableism: Essays on Ablement, Silence and Voice \" \nAs well as being a disability activist, Campbell played an integral role in the government and non-government sectors. She advised former Ministers of Community Services Senator &lt;a href=\"Don%20Grimes\"&gt;Don Grimes&lt;/a&gt; as well as Dr. &lt;a href=\"Neal%20Blewett\"&gt;Neil Blewitt&lt;/a&gt;, playing a fundamental role in the establishment of attendant care in Australia.\nCampbell contributions to academic journals include the International Advisory Board of the Socio-Legal Review, &lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Literary%20and%20Cultural%20Disability%20Studies\"&gt;Journal of Literary and Cultural Disability Studies (Liverpool)&lt;/a&gt;, Ethnographica: Journal of Disability and Culture (&lt;a href=\"Leuven\"&gt;Leuven&lt;/a&gt;, Belgium), the International Review of Disability Studies, and Associate Editor, Journal of Social Inclusion (Griffith) and the Scientific Board of the Italian Journal of Disability Studies.\nImportant writings.\nWhen discussing Fiona Campbell, it is important to note that she, herself, is an incomplete &lt;a href=\"Tetraplegia\"&gt;quadriplegic&lt;/a&gt; and experiences other &lt;a href=\"Chronic%20condition\"&gt;chronic illnesses&lt;/a&gt;. Campbell uses her experience of disability to inform and educate people on the nature by which ableism and dis-ableism come about and how conversations are created through different mediums of this discourse. Campbell has published essays which discuss topics dealing with the production of disability itself, \u201cThe Ableist Project,\u201d and how Ableism and abledment are created through an examination of &lt;a href=\"Critical%20race%20theory\"&gt;The Critical Race Theory&lt;/a&gt;.\nContours of Ableism: The Production of Disability and Ableness\nCampbell wrote \"Contours of Ableism\" not as an introduction to disability, but to broaden the spectrum of learning for those already immersed in the field. The book allows for an addition to social scientific texts regarding disability. Campbell's writings are erudite, &lt;a href=\"culture\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt;d expansions of the theory she created coined the \u201cableist project.\u201d In each of her chapters she focusses on a different topical area that lends a hand to elaborating and exaggerating how ableism plays a role in daily social life. Each of the chapters, while generalizing and describing different topical areas, develop a binary dynamic of ableism and dis-ableism. This binary dynamic is described throughout her writings through a variety of contexts including law, education, medicine, and science and technology.\nThe Ableist Project is an explanation of the three steps Campbell proposes in which to deal with the problematic conversation that is ableism. Campbell First explores the problems with people thinking, feeling and speaking about the \"&lt;a href=\"Other%20%28philosophy%29\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt;\" (otthisher being the disabled person). It is here that she argues that it is important to shift the focus the disability itself to the researching and understanding of ableism. Her second task deals with what can be described as \"ableist relations.\" This includes anything that may be even remotely accurate in the conversation involving what is and what is not characterized as \"ableist\". Finally, in order to make the true connection, she looks at real life examples in which examples of ability are portrayed and how this differs from examples of disability.\nAbleism examined through Critical Race Theory (CRT)\nCampbell explores an assessment of critical race theory and how this theory can contribute to different thoughts associated with ableism, and disability in general. The main focus of the paper deals with the idea of &lt;a href=\"internalized%20racism\"&gt;internalized racism&lt;/a&gt; and how its application in critical race theory applies to disability studies. Campbell explores the ways that racism and ableism are internalized and reflected in the process of understanding the convergence of the two across conversation.\n\"Aids and equipment\"\nIn this essay, Campbell argues again for the shift in redefining disability. She is in favor of directing the definition toward a more &lt;a href=\"Social%20constructionism\"&gt;social construction&lt;/a&gt;. She relays information regarding the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Population%20Censuses%20and%20Surveys\"&gt;OPCS&lt;/a&gt; study which indicates that over 6 million adults and 14 percent of people living in households suffer from some form of disability, the most common stemming from mobility and leaning into hearing and personal care. Campbell's main argument in this piece is that with so many people in need of medical assistance or aid, the finding of these avenues and solutions should not be so difficult and frustrating. She explains the &lt;a href=\"Quantitative%20research\"&gt;quantitative&lt;/a&gt;/survey methods that were adopted in order to successfully identify the ease at which people are able to receive the aids and care they need or desire, and found that prior research was correct in their negative accusations of availability.\nKeywords for Disability study.\nCampbell focuses on long time &lt;a href=\"Oppression\"&gt;social oppression&lt;/a&gt; and discrimination appearance of disabled people and tried to stand for their rights. Unconsciously, some words used in disability studies have negative connotations. Campbell tried to change and redefine some of the key concepts. Key concepts include:\nHonors and awards.\nRecognitions that honor Campbell's work and writings include the D. M. Myers University Medal in 1998 by &lt;a href=\"La%20Trobe%20University\"&gt;La Trobe University&lt;/a&gt;, the Deans' Medal (Faculty of Law &amp; Management), the &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Martin%20%28sociologist%29\"&gt;Jean Martin&lt;/a&gt; Prize in Sociology and the Blake, and the Dawson Waldron - 4th year Legal Studies Prize.\nProfessional membership.\nCampbell is affiliated to the following professional organizations:\nYouTube series.\nFiona Kumari Campbell has a series of conferences and discussions filmed and posted to her &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/user/fionakumari\"&gt;YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube is an outlet for outlining Studies in Ableism. The current videos discuss her book Contours of Ableism and specific problems the public has with disabilities.\nAbleism has been studied for several decades. Campbell fights for the idea of able-ness to grow and become more widespread. She defines who is a disabled person. Disability activism needs to include more individuals who are disabled. However, most disabled individuals stray away from disability activism because in people who see are not disabled see disability as a personal tragedy, harmful and not normal, and may view activism as the cry out for people\u2019s pain and suffering. The encounter with society one may feel rejection, and it\u2019s the social interaction that causes the spotlight on disabilities. It is not common it does not mean abnormality; diversity is something that should be embraced not looked down on.\nCampbell is very passionate about advocating with disabilities because she has a disability herself. She refers to herself as a disability studies scholar. She explains that people with disabilities live precarious lives. The capacity to move in a flourishing way is compromised. She continues to explain that, \"Ableism closes off possibility and imagination, ontologically killing people\u201d.\nFiona Campbell believes that the way we think of disabilities has to change. She questions why we have discomfort with people with disabilities. We exaggerate the idea of disabilities within individuals. There has to be a shift in thinking for disabilities studies. She shares her concept of \u201cnormative shadows.\" Campbell explains that we are all disabled in some sense."
