    "text": "The Lone Ranger is a fictional &lt;a href=\"Domino%20mask\"&gt;masked&lt;/a&gt; former &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Ranger%20Division\"&gt;Texas Ranger&lt;/a&gt; who fought &lt;a href=\"outlaw\"&gt;outlaw&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"American%20frontier\"&gt;American Old West&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; friend, &lt;a href=\"Tonto\"&gt;Tonto&lt;/a&gt;. The character has been called an enduring icon of American culture.\nHe first appeared in 1933 in a &lt;a href=\"radio%20show\"&gt;radio show&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"WXYT%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WXYZ&lt;/a&gt; (Detroit), conceived either by station owner &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Trendle\"&gt;George W. Trendle&lt;/a&gt; or by &lt;a href=\"Fran%20Striker\"&gt;Fran Striker&lt;/a&gt;, the show's writer. The radio series proved to be a hit, and spawned a series of books (largely written by Striker), an equally popular &lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Ranger%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;television show&lt;/a&gt; that ran from 1949 to 1957, comic books, and several films. The title character was played on the radio show by &lt;a href=\"Earle%20Graser\"&gt;Earle Graser&lt;/a&gt; for some 1,300 episodes, but three others preceded him, according to \"The New York Times\": \"a man named Deeds, who lasted only a few weeks; a George Stenius [actually &lt;a href=\"George%20Seaton\"&gt;George Seaton&lt;/a&gt; according to the \"Los Angeles Times\"], and then &lt;a href=\"Brace%20Beemer\"&gt;Brace Beemer&lt;/a&gt;; the latter became the narrator of the program.\n&lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Moore\"&gt;Clayton Moore&lt;/a&gt; portrayed the Lone Ranger on television, although, during a contract dispute, Moore was replaced for a season by &lt;a href=\"John%20Hart%20%28actor%29\"&gt;John Hart&lt;/a&gt;, who wore a different style of mask. On the radio, Tonto was played by, among others, &lt;a href=\"John%20Todd%20%28actor%29\"&gt;John Todd&lt;/a&gt; and Roland Parker; and in the television series, by &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Silverheels\"&gt;Jay Silverheels&lt;/a&gt;, who was a &lt;a href=\"Mohawk%20people\"&gt;Mohawk&lt;/a&gt; from the Six Nations Indian Reserve in &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, Canada.\nOrigin.\nWhile details differ, the basic story of the Lone Ranger's origin is consistent in most versions of the franchise. The Lone Ranger is the sole survivor of a group of six ambushed &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Ranger%20Division\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt;. A posse of six members of the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Ranger%20Division\"&gt;Texas Ranger Division&lt;/a&gt;, led by Captain Dan Reid, pursued a band of outlaws led by Bartholomew \"Butch\" Cavendish, but are betrayed by a civilian guide named Collins, who was secretly working with Cavendish, and led the unsuspecting rangers into an ambush at a canyon known as Bryant's Gap. Later, a &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; named Tonto stumbles onto the grisly scene. He discovers one of the rangers, Captain Reid's younger brother, John, barely alive, and he nurses the man to health. In some versions, Tonto recognizes the lone survivor as the man who had saved his life when they both were children. According to the television series, Tonto gave John a ring and the name &lt;a href=\"Ke-mo%20sah-bee\"&gt;Kemo Sabe&lt;/a&gt;, which he said means \"trusty scout\". John Reid then tells Tonto that he intends to hunt down Cavendish and his men and to bring them to &lt;a href=\"justice\"&gt;justice&lt;/a&gt;. To conceal his identity and honor his fallen brother, John fashions a black &lt;a href=\"domino%20mask\"&gt;domino mask&lt;/a&gt; using cloth from his late brother's vest. To aid in the deception, Tonto digs a sixth grave and places at its head a cross bearing John Reid's name so that Cavendish and his gang will believe that all the Rangers had been killed.\nIn many versions, Reid continues fighting for justice as the Lone Ranger even after the Cavendish gang is captured.\nCharacters.\nThe Lone Ranger.\nAs generally depicted, the Lone Ranger conducts himself by a strict &lt;a href=\"Moral%20Code\"&gt;moral code&lt;/a&gt; based on that put in place by Striker at the inception of the character. It read:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nI believe that to have a friend,\na man must be one.\nThat all men are created equal\nand that everyone has within himself\nthe power to make this a better world.\nThat God put the firewood there\nbut that every man\nmust gather and light it himself.\nIn being prepared\nphysically, mentally, and morally\nto fight when necessary\nfor what is right.\nThat a man should make the most\nof what equipment he has.\nThat 'this government, \nof the people, by the people\nand for the people'\nshall live always.\nThat men should live by\nthe rule of what is best\nfor the greatest number.\nThat sooner or later...\nsomewhere...somehow...\nwe must settle with the world\nand make payment for what we have taken.\nThat all things change but truth,\nand that truth alone, lives on forever.\nIn my Creator, my country, my fellow man.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn addition, Fran Striker and George W. Trendle drew up the following guidelines that embody who and what the Lone Ranger is:\nThe Lone Ranger's first name.\nAlthough the Lone Ranger's last name in the radio shows was given as Reid, his first name was never specified in any of the radio or television shows. Various radio reference books, beginning with \"Radio's Golden Age\" (Eastern Valley Press, 1966), give the Lone Ranger's first name as John. Some cite the 20th-anniversary radio program in 1953 as the source of the name, but the Lone Ranger's first name is never mentioned in that episode.\nIn the final chapter of the 1938 Republic \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Ranger%20%28serial%29\"&gt;The Lone Ranger&lt;/a&gt;\" movie serial, he is revealed to be Texas Ranger Allen King. In the second serial, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Ranger%20Rides%20Again\"&gt;The Lone Ranger Rides Again&lt;/a&gt;\", he identifies himself as Bill Andrews.\nThe Lone Ranger's first name is also thought to have not been mentioned in contemporary Lone Ranger newspaper comics, comic books, and tie-in &lt;a href=\"radio%20premium\"&gt;premiums&lt;/a&gt;, though some have stated that the name John Reid was used in an illustration of the grave marker made by Tonto, which appeared in either a comic-book version of the character's origin story or in a children's record set.\nThe name John Reid is used in the 1981 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20the%20Lone%20Ranger\"&gt;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&lt;/a&gt;\". The Lone Ranger is also John Reid in &lt;a href=\"Dynamite%20Entertainment\"&gt;Dynamite Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;'s licensed Lone Ranger &lt;a href=\"comic-book\"&gt;comic-book&lt;/a&gt; series that began in 2006, and in the 2013 Disney film \"The Lone Ranger\".\nThe name Luke Hartman was used in the 2003 TV-movie/unsold series pilot.\nTonto.\nThe character made his initial appearance in the 11th episode of the radio show. Fran Striker told his son that Tonto was added so the Lone Ranger would have someone to talk to. He was named by &lt;a href=\"James%20Jewell%20%28director%29\"&gt;James Jewell&lt;/a&gt;, who also came up with the term \"Kemosabe\" based on the name of a summer camp owned by his father-in-law in upstate Michigan. In the local Native American language, \"Tonto\" meant \"wild one\".\nThe character spoke in broken English that emphasized Tonto had learned it as a second language.\nBecause means \"stupid\" or \"ignorant\" in Spanish, the character is renamed \"\" (Spanish for \"bull\") or \"\" in Spanish-speaking countries.\nDan Reid Jr..\nThe name of Captain Reid's son, the Lone Ranger's nephew, a character introduced in the radio series in 1942, who became a juvenile sidekick to the Masked Man, is Dan Reid. When Trendle and Striker later created \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Hornet\"&gt;The Green Hornet&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1936, they made this Dan Reid the father of Britt Reid, alias the Green Hornet, thereby making the Lone Ranger the Green Hornet's great-uncle. In \"The Lone Ranger\" radio series, Dan was played by Ernest Winstanley, Bob Martin, Clarence Weitzel, &lt;a href=\"James%20Lipton\"&gt;James Lipton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Beals\"&gt;Dick Beals&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lone Ranger's nephew made his first appearance in \"Heading North\" (December 14, 1942) under the name Dan Frisby, the grandson of Grandma Frisby. The two lived in an area described as \"the high border country of the northwest\" near the town of Martinsville close to the Canada\u2013US border. This and the following four episodes (\"Design for Murder\", December 16, 1942; \"Rope's End\", December 18, 1942; \"Law of the Apex\", December 21, 1942; and \"Dan's Strange Behavior\", December 23, 1942) centered on a plot to steal the valuable Martin Copper Mine and Dan's being fooled by a Lone Ranger impostor into helping him steal it. The Lone Ranger and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police\"&gt;Mounties&lt;/a&gt; foil the plot and capture the impostor and his gang.\nIn the final episode of the arc, \"A Nephew Is Found\" (December 25, 1942), dying Grandma Frisby reveals to the Lone Ranger Dan's true identity and how he came to be with her. Fifteen years previously, Grandma Frisby had been part of a wagon train travelling to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Laramie%20National%20Historic%20Site\"&gt;Fort Laramie&lt;/a&gt;. Also on that wagon train had been Linda Reid, wife of Texas Ranger Captain Dan Reid, and her six-month-old son, Dan Jr., who were travelling from their home in Virginia to join her husband. Before the wagon train could reach Fort Laramie, Indians attacked it and Linda Reid was among those killed. Grandma Frisby took charge and care of Dan Jr., but upon reaching Fort Laramie, found two messages waiting, one that Captain Reid (voiced in this story by &lt;a href=\"Al%20Hodge\"&gt;Al Hodge&lt;/a&gt;) had been killed in an ambush at Bryant's Gap and the other that her own husband had been killed in an explosion. Taking Dan and certain items concerning his identity (including a small gold locket containing a picture of Dan's parents and a picture of Captain Reid's brother), Grandma Frisby travelled to Martinsville and raised Dan as her grandson.\nOn hearing this story, the Lone Ranger reveals his true identity and his own story to Grandma Frisby, and promises that he will care for Dan like his own son. Before Grandma Frisby dies, the Lone Ranger removes his mask and lets her see his face. Her last words are, \"Ride on, Lone Ranger ... ride on forever ... with Danny at your side.\" The Lone Ranger takes the grieving Dan outside the cabin, gives him the locket, and reveals their true relationship. Dan Reid Jr. went on to be a recurring character throughout the remainder of the series, riding with the Lone Ranger and Tonto on his own horse Victor.\nEventually, Dan Reid Jr. was sent East to gain an education, making infrequent appearances on the series whenever Fran Striker wanted to remind the audience of the family connection, and later became part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Hornet%20%28radio%20series%29\"&gt;The Green Hornet&lt;/a&gt;\" radio series, first appearing on October 22, 1936, establishing the connection between the Lone Ranger and the Green Hornet in the episode \"Too Hot to Handle\" (November 11, 1947) and being played throughout the series by John Todd, who played Tonto on \"The Lone Ranger\" radio series.\nTheir horses.\nAccording to the episode \"The Legend of Silver\" (September 30, 1938), before acquiring Silver, the Lone Ranger rode a chestnut mare called Dusty. The Lone Ranger saves Silver's life from an enraged buffalo, and in gratitude, Silver chooses to give up his wild life to carry him.\nThe origin of Tonto's horse, Scout, is less clear. For a long time, Tonto rides a white horse called White Feller. In \"Four Day Ride\" (August 5, 1938), Tonto is given a &lt;a href=\"American%20Paint%20Horse\"&gt;paint horse&lt;/a&gt; by his friend Chief Thundercloud, who then takes White Feller. Tonto rides this horse and refers to him simply as \"Paint Horse\" for several episodes. The horse is finally named Scout in \"Border Dope Smuggling\" (September 2, 1938). In another episode, however, the Lone Ranger, in a surge of conscience, releases Silver back to the wild. The episode ends with Silver returning, bringing along a companion that becomes Tonto's horse Scout.\nIn an echo of the Lone Ranger's line, Tonto frequently says, \"Git-um up, Scout!\" (The phrase became so well embedded in the Lone Ranger mythos that &lt;a href=\"International%20Harvester\"&gt;International Harvester&lt;/a&gt; used it as an advertising line to promote their &lt;a href=\"International%20Harvester%20Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"utility%20vehicle\"&gt;utility vehicle&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s.) In the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Ranger%20%281966%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Format Films animated cartoon, which ran from 1966 to 1968&lt;/a&gt;, Tonto also had an eagle he called Taka, and installments that focused exclusively on him or had him team up with the Lone Ranger ended with his saying, \"Fly, Taka! On, Scout!\" (Those where he teamed with the Lone Ranger had the Ranger following this up with the customary \"Hi-yo, Silver! Away!\")\nOriginal radio series.\nThe creators of the character were George Trendle (manager of WXYZ radio station) and writer Fran Striker.\nThe first of 2,956 radio episodes of \"The Lone Ranger\" premiered on &lt;a href=\"WXYT%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WXYZ&lt;/a&gt;, a radio station serving &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, on January 31, 1933. As Dunning writes in \"On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio:\"\nThe show was an immediate success. Though it was aimed at children, adults made up at least half the audience. It became so popular, it was picked up by the &lt;a href=\"Mutual%20Broadcasting%20System\"&gt;Mutual Broadcasting System&lt;/a&gt; and, on May 2, 1942, by NBC's &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Network\"&gt;Blue Network&lt;/a&gt;, which in time became &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 1939, some 20 million Americans were listening to the program. It also had numerous listeners in other countries.\nIntroductions.\nAn announcer introduced each episode with the following, which was sometimes changed to reflect the storyline of the episode:\nIn the early days of the western United States, a masked man and an Indian rode the plains, searching for truth and justice. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear, when from out of the past come the thundering hoofbeats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!\nBy the time it was on ABC at 7:30 pm Eastern, the introduction, voiced by &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Foy\"&gt;Fred Foy&lt;/a&gt;, had become \"Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear\", followed by, \"From out of the west with the speed of light and a hearty 'Hi-yo, Silver! The intro was later changed to:\nA fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The Lone Ranger! ... With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early western United States! Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a greater champion of justice! Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear! From out of the past come the thundering hoofbeats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!\nThis was followed by Brace Beemer's voice, declaring, \"Come on, Silver! Let's go, big fellow! Hi-yo, Silver! Away!\"\nCast.\nThe Lone Ranger was played by several actors:\nTonto was played throughout the run by actor &lt;a href=\"John%20Todd%20%28actor%29\"&gt;John Todd&lt;/a&gt; (although in a few isolated occasions, he was replaced by Roland Parker, better known as Kato for much of the run of sister series \"The Green Hornet\"). Other supporting players were selected from Detroit area actors and studio staff. These included Jay Michael (who also played the lead on \"&lt;a href=\"Challenge%20of%20the%20Yukon\"&gt;Challenge of the Yukon&lt;/a&gt;\", or \"Sgt. Preston of the Yukon\"), Bill Saunders (as various villains, including Butch Cavendish), Paul Hughes (as the Ranger's friend Thunder Martin and as various army colonels and badmen), future movie star &lt;a href=\"John%20Hodiak\"&gt;John Hodiak&lt;/a&gt;, Janka Fasciszewska (under the name Jane Fae), and &lt;a href=\"Rube%20Weiss\"&gt;Rube Weiss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liz%20Weiss\"&gt;Liz Weiss&lt;/a&gt; (later a married couple, both actors in several radio and television programs in Detroit, Rube usually taking on villain roles on the \"Ranger\", and Liz playing damsels in distress). The part of nephew Dan Reid was played by various child actors, including Bob Martin, &lt;a href=\"James%20Lipton\"&gt;James Lipton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Beals\"&gt;Dick Beals&lt;/a&gt;.\nMusic.\nThe theme music was primarily taken from the \"March of the Swiss Soldiers\" finale of &lt;a href=\"Gioachino%20Rossini\"&gt;Gioachino Rossini&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"William%20Tell%20Overture\"&gt;\"William Tell\" Overture&lt;/a&gt;, which thus came to be inseparably associated with the series. The theme was conducted by Daniel P\u00e9rez Casta\u00f1eda, with the softer parts excerpted from \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Moldau\"&gt;Die Moldau&lt;/a&gt;\", composed by &lt;a href=\"Bed%C5%99ich%20Smetana\"&gt;Bed\u0159ich Smetana&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany other classical selections were used as incidental music, including &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Wagner's&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Flying%20Dutchman%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Flying Dutchman Overture&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Bizet\"&gt;Bizet&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Symphony%20in%20C%20%28Bizet%29\"&gt;Symphony in C&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Mendelssohn\"&gt;Mendelssohn&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Hebrides%20%28overture%29\"&gt;\"Fingal's Cave\" Overture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emil%20von%20%C5%98ezn%C3%AD%C4%8Dek\"&gt;Emil von \u0158ezn\u00ed\u010dek&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Donna%20Diana\"&gt;Donna Diana&lt;/a&gt;\" Overture, &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Liszt\"&gt;Liszt&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20pr%C3%A9ludes\"&gt;Les pr\u00e9ludes&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky\"&gt;Tchaikovsky&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"1812%20Overture\"&gt;\"1812\" Overture&lt;/a&gt; and music by &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Schubert\"&gt;Schubert&lt;/a&gt;. Classical music was originally used because it was in the &lt;a href=\"public%20domain\"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt;, thus allowing production costs to be kept low while providing a wide range of music as needed without the cost of a composer. \nIn the late 1930s, Trendle acquired the rights to use incidental music from &lt;a href=\"Republic%20Pictures\"&gt;Republic Pictures&lt;/a&gt; motion picture serials as part of a deal for Republic to produce a serial based (loosely) on the Lone Ranger. This music was then modified by NBC radio arranger Ben Bonnell and recorded in Mexico to avoid American union rules. This music was used in both the radio and later television shows.\n\"The Green Hornet\".\nThe radio series inspired a spinoff called \"The Green Hornet,\" which depicts the son of the Lone Ranger's nephew Dan, &lt;a href=\"Britt%20Reid\"&gt;Britt Reid&lt;/a&gt;, originally played by &lt;a href=\"Al%20Hodge\"&gt;Al Hodge&lt;/a&gt;, who in contemporary times, fights crime with a similar secret identity and a &lt;a href=\"sidekick\"&gt;sidekick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kato%20%28The%20Green%20Hornet%29\"&gt;Kato&lt;/a&gt;. One major difference between the two characters is that everyone considers the Green Hornet to be a bad guy. Reid embraces this persona, thus enabling him to infiltrate real crime syndicates, while secretly aiding the police.\nIn the Green Hornet comic book series published by &lt;a href=\"NOW%20Comics\"&gt;NOW Comics&lt;/a&gt;, the Lone Ranger makes a cameo appearance by being in a portrait in the Reid home. Contrary to most visual media depictions, and acknowledged by developer/original script writer &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Fortier\"&gt;Ron Fortier&lt;/a&gt; to be the result of legal complications, his mask covers all of his face, as it did in the two serials from &lt;a href=\"Republic%20Pictures\"&gt;Republic Pictures&lt;/a&gt; (see below). However, rights to The Lone Ranger and The Green Hornet have been acquired by separate owners and the familial link has been ignored in the Western character's various incarnations. The Lone Ranger\u00a0\u2013 Green Hornet connection is part of &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Jos%C3%A9%20Farmer\"&gt;Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Wold%20Newton%20Universe\"&gt;Wold Newton Universe&lt;/a&gt;, which connects disparate fictional characters.\nHi-Yo Silver!, Kemo sabe, and other cultural tropes.\nAt the beginning of each episode, the magnificent white stallion, Silver, would rear up with the Lone Ranger on his back, then they would dash off, the Ranger encouragingly shouting, \"Hi-Yo, Silver!\" Tonto could occasionally be heard to urge on his mount by calling out, \"Get 'em up, Scout!\" At the end of each episode, mission completed, one of the characters would always ask the sheriff or other authority, \"Who was that masked man?\" When it was explained, \"Oh, he's the Lone Ranger!\", the Ranger and Tonto would be seen galloping off with the cry, \"Hi-Yo, Silver! Away!\" catching the attention of one of the townspeople crossing the street.\n&lt;a href=\"Tonto\"&gt;Tonto&lt;/a&gt; usually referred to the Lone Ranger as \"&lt;a href=\"Kemo%20sabe\"&gt;Kemo sabe&lt;/a&gt;\", described as meaning either \"faithful friend,\" or \"trusty scout\". It is more likely the word derives from the &lt;a href=\"Anishinaabe%20language\"&gt;Anishinaabe language&lt;/a&gt;. Gimoozaabi is said to mean \"he looks out in secret.\" These &lt;a href=\"catchphrase\"&gt;catchphrase&lt;/a&gt;s, the Ranger's trademark silver bullets, and the theme music from the &lt;a href=\"William%20Tell%20Overture\"&gt;\"William Tell\" Overture&lt;/a&gt; have become tropes of &lt;a href=\"popular%20culture\"&gt;popular culture&lt;/a&gt;.\nFilm serials.\n&lt;a href=\"Republic%20Pictures\"&gt;Republic Pictures&lt;/a&gt; released two &lt;a href=\"serial%20%28film%29\"&gt;serials&lt;/a&gt; starring the Lone Ranger. The first, released in 1938, utilized several actors playing different men portraying the masked hero, with the true Lone Ranger unknown to the audience until the conclusion; the character played by &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Powell%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Lee Powell&lt;/a&gt; is ultimately revealed to be the Lone Ranger. The second serial, \"The Lone Ranger Rides Again\", was released in 1939 and starred &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Livingston%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Robert Livingston&lt;/a&gt;. Tonto was played in both by Victor Daniels, billed as &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Thundercloud\"&gt;Chief Thundercloud&lt;/a&gt;.\nTelevision.\n\"The Lone Ranger\" was a TV show that aired for eight seasons, from 1949 to 1957, and starred &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Moore\"&gt;Clayton Moore&lt;/a&gt; as the Lone Ranger and &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Silverheels\"&gt;Jay Silverheels&lt;/a&gt; as Tonto. Only five of the eight seasons had new episodes. It was the &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; television network's first big hit of the early 1950s. Moore's tenure as the Ranger is probably the best-known treatment of the franchise. Moore was replaced in the third season by &lt;a href=\"John%20Hart%20%28actor%29\"&gt;John Hart&lt;/a&gt;, but he returned for the final two seasons. The fifth and final season were shot in color. A total of 221 episodes were made.\nAfter the series ended, Moore continued to make public appearances as the Lone Ranger. In 1979, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Wrather\"&gt;Jack Wrather&lt;/a&gt;, then owner of the rights to the character, obtained a restraining order against Moore, enjoining Moore from appearing in public in his mask. The actor began wearing oversized wraparound &lt;a href=\"Foster%20Grant\"&gt;Foster Grant&lt;/a&gt; sunglasses, as a substitute for the mask. Moore later won a countersuit, allowing him to resume his costume.\n\"The Return of the Lone Ranger\" (1961).\nIn 1961 &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; produced \"Return of the Lone Ranger\", starring Tex Hill, as the &lt;a href=\"television%20pilot\"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; episode for a proposed TV series.\nFormat Films animated cartoon, 1966 to 1968.\nAn animated series of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Ranger%20%28animated%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Lone Ranger&lt;/a&gt;\" ran from 1966 to 1968 on CBS. It was produced by &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Klynn\"&gt;Herbert Klynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Engel\"&gt;Jules Engel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Format%20Films\"&gt;Format Films&lt;/a&gt;, Hollywood, and designed and animated at the &lt;a href=\"Halas%20and%20Batchelor\"&gt;Halas and Batchelor Cartoon Film&lt;/a&gt; studios in London, England. The show lasted thirty episodes; however, these were invariably split into three separate shorts, with the middle segment being a solo adventure for Tonto, so that there were actually 90 installments in all. The last episode aired on March 9, 1968.\nThese Lone Ranger adventures were similar in tone and nature to CBS's &lt;a href=\"science%20fiction%20Western\"&gt;science fiction Western&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wild%20Wild%20West\"&gt;The Wild Wild West&lt;/a&gt;,\" in that the plots were bizarre and had elements of science-fiction and &lt;a href=\"steampunk\"&gt;steampunk&lt;/a&gt; technology thrown in. Even the Lone Ranger's greatest enemy in the animated series was a dwarf, similar to James T. West's greatest enemy, &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Loveless\"&gt;Dr. Miguelito Loveless&lt;/a&gt;. He was called Tiny Tom, and was voiced by &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Beals\"&gt;Dick Beals&lt;/a&gt;. This animated cartoon was credited as being a Jack Wrather production, and it provided the first exposure many 1960s children had to the characters.\nThe Lone Ranger's voice was provided by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Rye\"&gt;Michael Rye&lt;/a&gt;, who had portrayed \"&lt;a href=\"Jack%20Armstrong%2C%20the%20All-American%20Boy\"&gt;Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy&lt;/a&gt;\" on radio. &lt;a href=\"Shepard%20Menken\"&gt;Shepard Menken&lt;/a&gt; played Tonto. The narrator in the opening title was &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Miller%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Marvin Miller&lt;/a&gt;. Other \"guest voices\" were provided by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Winchell\"&gt;Paul Winchell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agnes%20Moorehead\"&gt;Agnes Moorehead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Conried\"&gt;Hans Conried&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour\", early 1980s.\nThe Lone Ranger was featured, along with &lt;a href=\"Zorro\"&gt;Zorro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tarzan\"&gt;Tarzan&lt;/a&gt;, in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tarzan/Lone%20Ranger%20Adventure%20Hour\"&gt;Adventure Hour&lt;/a&gt;\" cartoon shorts in the early 1980s, produced by &lt;a href=\"Filmation\"&gt;Filmation&lt;/a&gt;. These episodes featured &lt;a href=\"William%20Conrad\"&gt;William Conrad&lt;/a&gt; as the voice of the Masked Man, although he was listed in the credits as \"J. Darnoc\" (Conrad spelled backwards). This series took a more realistic tone with a heavily historical context to include an educational element to the stories, even though there were several episodes that did feature elements of science fiction (much like the earlier cartoons from the 1960s). There were 14 episodes, combining two adventures in each episode, for a total of 28 stories. Though Conrad was the main voice featured, other noted voice actors in the Filmation series include an uncredited &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Scheimer\"&gt;Lou Scheimer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Welker\"&gt;Frank Welker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Bell%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Michael Bell&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Lone Ranger \"(2003).\nIn 2003, the &lt;a href=\"The%20WB\"&gt;WB&lt;/a&gt; network aired a two-hour Lone Ranger TV movie, starring &lt;a href=\"Chad%20Michael%20Murray\"&gt;Chad Michael Murray&lt;/a&gt; as the Lone Ranger. The TV movie served as the pilot for a possible new series. However, the movie was greeted unenthusiastically; the name of the secret identity of the Lone Ranger was changed from \"John Reid\" to \"Luke Hartman\", and while an empty grave was still alongside those of the five dead Rangers, its supposed occupant was unidentified, and the hero maintained his unmasked identity, as well, becoming a cowboy version of &lt;a href=\"Zorro\"&gt;Zorro&lt;/a&gt;, as in the first film serial. Ultimately, the project was shelved, with the &lt;a href=\"television%20pilot\"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; aired in telefilm form during the summer season due to Murray's popularity with the target audience of the network.\nOther appearances.\nClayton Moore appeared in character in an episode of \"&lt;a href=\"Lassie%20%281954%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Lassie&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1958. John Hart appeared in an episode of \"&lt;a href=\"Happy%20Days\"&gt;Happy Days&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAn episode of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Greatest%20American%20Hero\"&gt;The Greatest American Hero&lt;/a&gt;\", titled, \"My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys,\" had a special appearance by John Hart as The Lone Ranger. In the story, superhero Ralph Hinkley is despondent over his failures, and considers giving up, until he is encouraged by Hart's retelling of the Lone Ranger's exploits.\nFilms.\nClayton Moore series.\nAfter the end of the television series, Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels starred in two feature films, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Ranger%20%281956%20film%29\"&gt;The Lone Ranger&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1956 and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Ranger%20and%20the%20Lost%20City%20of%20Gold\"&gt;The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1958.\n\"The Lone Ranger and the Peace Patrol\".\nIn 1958 the Lone Ranger appeared in the eight-minute-long documentary, \"The Lone Ranger and the Peace Patrol\". Presented and narrated by Clayton Moore, it revolves around purchasing &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Savings%20Stamps\"&gt;U.S. Savings Stamps&lt;/a&gt;, a child's version of &lt;a href=\"Savings%20Bonds\"&gt;Savings Bonds&lt;/a&gt;. The main focus is to get children to invest in the stamps. The narrated segment culminates with the inaugural ceremonies on the grounds of the Washington Memorial before a crowd of thousands of children and their parents.\nOther Lone Rangers.\n\"The Legend of the Lone Ranger\" (1981).\nAt the time of the 1981 release of the film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20the%20Lone%20Ranger\"&gt;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&lt;/a&gt;\", the company owning the rights to the character, Wrather Corp., filed a lawsuit and obtained a court injunction to prevent Clayton Moore from appearing as the Lone Ranger, and then gave a cameo to his TV replacement, &lt;a href=\"John%20Hart%20%28actor%29\"&gt;John Hart&lt;/a&gt;. The film itself was a critical and commercial failure. It starred &lt;a href=\"Klinton%20Spilsbury\"&gt;Klinton Spilsbury&lt;/a&gt; in his only motion picture appearance. His lines were overdubbed by &lt;a href=\"James%20Keach\"&gt;James Keach&lt;/a&gt;. The part of Tonto was played by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Horse\"&gt;Michael Horse&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoore, who never appeared publicly without his mask, was enjoined in the lawsuit from wearing it and, in protest, he began wearing oversized sunglasses that were the approximate size and shape of the mask. In a sequence in the movie, John Reid, a newly graduated attorney, is travelling west in a stagecoach to meet his brother. Another passenger announces his intent to make his fortune from his invention of sunglasses. The stage is robbed and the inventor killed. As John Reid lays the dead man on the floor with the broken dark glasses, yet another passenger says, \"So much for American opportunity.\"\n\"The Lone Ranger\" (2013).\nIn 2013, &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20Pictures\"&gt;Walt Disney Pictures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Bruckheimer%20Films\"&gt;Jerry Bruckheimer Films&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Ranger%20%282013%20film%29\"&gt;\"The Lone Ranger\"&lt;/a&gt;, starring &lt;a href=\"Armie%20Hammer\"&gt;Armie Hammer&lt;/a&gt; as the Lone Ranger and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Depp\"&gt;Johnny Depp&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Tonto\"&gt;Tonto&lt;/a&gt;. Directed by &lt;a href=\"Gore%20Verbinski\"&gt;Gore Verbinski&lt;/a&gt;, the film is an &lt;a href=\"origin%20story\"&gt;origin story&lt;/a&gt; of the two characters and explores the duo's efforts to subdue the immoral actions of the corrupt, and to bring them to justice, in the American Old West. The film, produced with an estimated budget of $225 million, was received negatively by American critics and performed poorly at the &lt;a href=\"box%20office\"&gt;box office&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther media.\nThe series also inspired numerous &lt;a href=\"comic%20book\"&gt;comic book&lt;/a&gt;s, books, and &lt;a href=\"gramophone%20record\"&gt;gramophone record&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNovels.\nThe first Lone Ranger novel appeared in 1936, and eventually 18 volumes were published, as listed below. The first book was written by &lt;a href=\"Gaylord%20Dubois\"&gt;Gaylord Dubois&lt;/a&gt;, but the others were written by the character's primary developer, Fran Striker. Striker also re-edited and rewrote parts of later editions of the first novel. First published between 1936 and 1956 in hardback by &lt;a href=\"Grosset%20%26amp%3B%20Dunlap\"&gt;Grosset and Dunlap&lt;/a&gt;, these stories were reprinted in 1978 by &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20Books\"&gt;Pinnacle Books&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2012, &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Books\"&gt;Moonstone Books&lt;/a&gt; published the novel \"The Lone Ranger: Vendetta\", written by Howard Hopkins.\nNot considered part of the 18 series:\nBig Little Books.\nFrom 1935 to 1950, 13 &lt;a href=\"Big%20Little%20Book\"&gt;Big Little Book&lt;/a&gt;s were published.\nLittle Golden Books.\nThree &lt;a href=\"Little%20Golden%20Books\"&gt;Little Golden Books&lt;/a&gt; were published.\nAnthologies.\nIn, 1993, Perennial published the &lt;a href=\"anthology\"&gt;anthology&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Ranger%20and%20Tonto%20Fistfight%20in%20Heaven\"&gt;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven&lt;/a&gt;\", a collection of short stories by &lt;a href=\"Sherman%20Alexie\"&gt;Sherman Alexie&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2012, &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Books\"&gt;Moonstone Books&lt;/a&gt; published the anthology \"The Lone Ranger Chronicles\", edited by Matthew Baugh Starr with stories by Johnny. D Boggs, &lt;a href=\"James%20Reasoner\"&gt;James Reasoner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mel%20Odom%20%28author%29\"&gt;Mel Odom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Crider\"&gt;Bill Crider&lt;/a&gt;, Matthew Baugh, Tim Lasiuta, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Gentile\"&gt;Joe Gentile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Kupperberg\"&gt;Paul Kupperberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Dennis O'Neil&lt;/a&gt;, Kent Conwell, David McDonald, Thom Brannon, Troy D. Smith, &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Dixon\"&gt;Chuck Dixon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Dean%20Starr\"&gt;Richard Dean Starr&lt;/a&gt;, stories incorporating famous characters of the western, such as &lt;a href=\"Cisco%20Kid\"&gt;Cisco Kid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wyatt%20Earp\"&gt;Wyatt Earp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doc%20Holliday\"&gt;Doc Holliday&lt;/a&gt;.\nComic strip.\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Features%20Syndicate\"&gt;King Features Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; distributed a newspaper strip of the Lone Ranger from September 1938 to December 1971. Fran Striker himself initially scripted the feature, but time constraints soon required him to quit, replaced by Bob Green, later followed by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20S.%20Newman\"&gt;Paul S. Newman&lt;/a&gt; and others. The original artist was Ed Kressy, but he was replaced in 1939 by who drew the strip until its conclusion.\nIn 1981, the New York Times Syndicate launched a second Lone Ranger strip, written by &lt;a href=\"Cary%20Bates\"&gt;Cary Bates&lt;/a&gt; with art by &lt;a href=\"Russ%20Heath\"&gt;Russ Heath&lt;/a&gt;. It ran until 1984. In 1993 Pure Imagination Publishing collected two of the storylines and put them in a comic book.\nComic books.\nIn 1948, &lt;a href=\"Western%20Publishing\"&gt;Western Publishing&lt;/a&gt;, with its publishing partner &lt;a href=\"Dell%20Comics\"&gt;Dell Comics&lt;/a&gt;, launched a comic book series which lasted for 145 issues. This series originally consisted of reprints from the newspaper strips (as had all previous comic book appearances of the character in various titles from &lt;a href=\"David%20McKay%20Publications\"&gt;David McKay Publications&lt;/a&gt; and from Dell). However, new stories by writer &lt;a href=\"Paul%20S.%20Newman\"&gt;Paul S. Newman&lt;/a&gt; and artist &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Gill%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Tom Gill&lt;/a&gt; began with issue #38 (August 1951). Some original content was presented as early as #7 (January 1949), but these were non-Lone Ranger fillers. Newman and Gill produced the series until its final issue, #145 (July 1962).\nTonto got his own spin-off title in 1951, which lasted 31 issues. Such was the Ranger's popularity at the time that even his horse Silver had a comic book, \"The Lone Ranger's Famous Horse Hi-Yo Silver\", starting in 1952 and running 34 issues; writer &lt;a href=\"Gaylord%20DuBois\"&gt;Gaylord DuBois&lt;/a&gt; wrote and developed Silver as a hero in his own right. In addition, Dell also published three big \"Lone Ranger\" annuals, as well as an adaptation of the 1956 theatrical film.\nThe Dell series came to an end in 1962. Later that same year, Western Publishing ended its publishing partnership with Dell Comics and started its own comic book imprint, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Key%20Comics\"&gt;Gold Key Comics&lt;/a&gt;. The new imprint launched its own \"Lone Ranger\" title in 1964. Initially reprinting material from the Dell run, original content did not begin until issue #22 in 1975, and the magazine itself folded with #28 in 1977. Additionally the same year, &lt;a href=\"Aktiebolag\"&gt;AB&lt;/a&gt; published a three-part Swedish Lone Ranger story in \"&lt;a href=\"Hemmets%20Journal\"&gt;Hemmets Journal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1994, &lt;a href=\"Topps%20Comics\"&gt;Topps Comics&lt;/a&gt; produced a four-issue &lt;a href=\"miniseries\"&gt;miniseries&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Lone Ranger and Tonto\", written by &lt;a href=\"Joe%20R.%20Lansdale\"&gt;Joe R. Lansdale&lt;/a&gt; and drawn by &lt;a href=\"Timothy%20Truman\"&gt;Timothy Truman&lt;/a&gt;. One of the major changes in this series was the characterization of Tonto, who was now shown to be a very witty, outspoken, and sarcastic character, even willing to punch the Lone Ranger during a heated argument, and commenting on his past pop-culture depictions with the words, \"Of course, \"quimo sabe\". Maybe when we talk I should use that 'me Tonto' stuff, the way they write about me in the dime novels. You'd like that, wouldn't you?\".\nThe first issue of a new Lone Ranger series from &lt;a href=\"Dynamite%20Entertainment\"&gt;Dynamite Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Matthews\"&gt;Brett Matthews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Cariello\"&gt;Sergio Cariello&lt;/a&gt; shipped on September 6, 2006. It was started as a six-issue miniseries; but due to its success, it has become an ongoing series by the same team. On September 15, 2006, Dynamite Entertainment announced that \"The Lone Ranger\" #1 had sold out its first printing. A second printing of the first issue was announced; a first for the company. The series has received an Eisner Awards nomination for best new series in 2007. \"&lt;a href=\"True%20West%20Magazine\"&gt;True West&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine awarded the publication the \"Best Western Comic Book of the Year\" in their 2009 \"Best of The West Source Book!\" And in 2010 Dynamite released \"The Lone Ranger Avenges the Death of Zorro\".\nThe second volume of the series by Dynamite was issued in January 2012. Written by &lt;a href=\"Ande%20Parks\"&gt;Ande Parks&lt;/a&gt; and drawn by Esteve Polls, it ran for a total of 25 numbers, with the last issue being released in June 2014.\nApart from the ongoing series, Dynamite released several miniseries starring the Lone Ranger, such as \"The Lone Ranger and Tonto\" (4 issues, written by Brett Matthews; John Abrams with art by Mario Guevara) in 2008; \"Snake of Iron\", a 5-part by &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Dixon\"&gt;Chuck Dixon&lt;/a&gt; and Steve Polls published in 2012, and \"Vindicated\", 4 issues by &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Gray\"&gt;Justin Gray&lt;/a&gt; and Rey Villegas in 2014.\nIn 2016, The Lone Ranger teamed-up with the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Hornet\"&gt;Green Hornet&lt;/a&gt; in a 5-part miniseries written by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20E.%20Uslan\"&gt;Michael Uslan&lt;/a&gt; with art by Giovani Timpano.\nA Dynamite \"Lone Ranger\" third volume, written by &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Russell%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Mark Russell&lt;/a&gt; and drawn by Bob Q, was released in October 2018 and ran 5 issues.\nComic book collections.\nAll of them from Dynamite Entertainment, include:\n\"The Lone Ranger Magazine\".\nIn 1937, eight issues of \"The Lone Ranger Magazine\" (pulps) were published by Trojan Publishing, with stories written by Fran Striker.\n1930s cartoon.\nIn late 1930s Roy Meredith produced the first-known animated film based on Lone Ranger, in this silent film The Lone Ranger and Tonto capture a band of cattle rustlers and save the life of the rancher.\nThis cartoon was produced by \"Pathegrams\" on &lt;a href=\"16mm\"&gt;16mm&lt;/a&gt; film and sold to the home market and libraries, which often showed cartoons as a prelude to the feature films they would play for children, much as they do videos now. It was a silent film, like most films produced for the home market in those days, and had dialog written on title cards, just as films of the silent era.\nVideo game.\nA &lt;a href=\"video%20game\"&gt;video game&lt;/a&gt; version of \"The Lone Ranger\" was released by &lt;a href=\"Konami\"&gt;Konami&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System\"&gt;Nintendo Entertainment System&lt;/a&gt; in North America in 1991. It is an &lt;a href=\"action%20adventure%20game\"&gt;action adventure game&lt;/a&gt; featuring three different perspectives: side-scrolling, overhead, and first-person exploration. The game loosely follows the plot of the 1981 film \"The Legend of the Lone Ranger,\" with the ultimate goal being the rescue of the President of the United States, whom the Lone Ranger's nemesis, \"Butch\" Cavendish, has kidnapped.\nMerchandise.\nPremiums.\n\"The Lone Ranger\" program offered many &lt;a href=\"radio%20premium\"&gt;radio premium&lt;/a&gt;s, including the Lone Ranger Six-Shooter Ring and the Lone Ranger Deputy Badge. Some used a silver bullet motif. One ring had a miniature of one of his six-guns atop it, with a flint and striking wheel, as used in cigarette lighters, so that \"fanning\" the miniature pistol would produce a shower of sparks. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the premiums adapted to the times. In 1942, the program offered the &lt;a href=\"Kix%20%28cereal%29\"&gt;Kix&lt;/a&gt; Blackout Kit.\nSome premiums were rather &lt;a href=\"anachronism\"&gt;anachronistic&lt;/a&gt; for a 19th-century hero. In 1947, the program offered the Kix Atomic Bomb Ring, also known to collectors as the Lone Ranger Atom Bomb Ring. This ring was a miniature &lt;a href=\"spinthariscope\"&gt;spinthariscope&lt;/a&gt; that actually had a small amount of &lt;a href=\"polonium-210\"&gt;polonium-210&lt;/a&gt; in it, which emitted &lt;a href=\"alpha%20particles\"&gt;alpha particles&lt;/a&gt; to produce scintillations on the &lt;a href=\"zinc%20sulfide\"&gt;zinc sulfide&lt;/a&gt; outer part of the ring. With its tailfin piece removed, though, the \"bomb\" body looked like a silver bullet.\nThe sponsor was &lt;a href=\"General%20Mills\"&gt;General Mills&lt;/a&gt;, with its &lt;a href=\"Breakfast%20cereal\"&gt;breakfast-cereal&lt;/a&gt; products: &lt;a href=\"Cheerios\"&gt;Cheerios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wheaties\"&gt;Wheaties&lt;/a&gt;, and Kix. In 1947, Cheerios produced a line of Frontier Town cereal boxes with the Lone Ranger likeness on the front of the box. Different versions of the boxes would have Frontier Town buildings on their backs to cut out. One could also send in ten cents and a box-top to get each of the four map sections of the town. These, as well as nine different boxes, were needed to complete the cardboard Frontier Town.\nToys and games.\nBesides the premiums offered in connection with the radio series, there have been many Lone Ranger commercial toys released over the years. One of the most successful was a line of 10-inch action figures and accessories released by &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Toys\"&gt;Gabriel Toys&lt;/a&gt; in 1973. Board games were released by Parker Brothers: The Lone Ranger Game, in 1938, and The New Lone Ranger Game, in 1956.\nParodies and spoofs.\nIn the 1939 &lt;a href=\"Looney%20Tunes\"&gt;Looney Tunes&lt;/a&gt; \"The Lone Stranger and Porky\", supervised by &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Clampett\"&gt;Bob Clampett&lt;/a&gt;, the masked man comes to the rescue of stagecoach driver in distress, &lt;a href=\"Porky%20Pig\"&gt;Porky Pig&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1940, &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Harman\"&gt;Hugh Harman&lt;/a&gt; made a Lone Ranger parody for &lt;a href=\"MGM%20Cartoons\"&gt;MGM Cartoons&lt;/a&gt; titled \"The Lonesome Stranger\".\nJay Silverheels appeared as Tonto on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tonight%20Show\"&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/a&gt;\" starring &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Carson\"&gt;Johnny Carson&lt;/a&gt; in a comedy sketch in which Carson is interviewing Tonto for employment. The audio portion of this sketch was included in the LP \"\", released by &lt;a href=\"Casablanca%20Records\"&gt;Casablanca Records&lt;/a&gt; in 1974.\nBoth Clayton Moore and Silverheels appeared as the Lone Ranger and Tonto in a commercial for &lt;a href=\"Totino%27s\"&gt;Jeno's Pizza Rolls&lt;/a&gt; produced by ad man/satirist &lt;a href=\"Stan%20Freberg\"&gt;Stan Freberg&lt;/a&gt;. The commercial was a spoof of a then-current commercial for &lt;a href=\"Lark%20%28cigarette%29\"&gt;Lark cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; which also used the \"William Tell\" overture theme music.\nA recorded routine by comic &lt;a href=\"Lenny%20Bruce\"&gt;Lenny Bruce&lt;/a&gt; formed the basis for the 1971 animated cartoon, \"&lt;a href=\"Thank%20You%20Mask%20Man\"&gt;Thank You Mask Man&lt;/a&gt;\", produced by John Magnuson Associates. This was an adult humor routine, comically implying a gay relationship between the Ranger and Tonto.\nParody versions of The Lone Ranger (called Lonely Rider) and Tonto appear as main characters in 1971 Finnish western comedy \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Unhanged\"&gt;The Unhanged&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t\"). They were played by &lt;a href=\"Vesa-Matti%20Loiri\"&gt;Vesa-Matti Loiri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Simo%20Salminen\"&gt;Simo Salminen&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Top Ranger\" is a parody produced by Disney starring &lt;a href=\"Mickey%20Mouse\"&gt;Mickey Mouse&lt;/a&gt; (Top Ranger) and &lt;a href=\"Goofy\"&gt;Goofy&lt;/a&gt; (Tonto-lone), with the script and drawing by Marco Gervasio and published in an Italian comic book, \"&lt;a href=\"Topolino\"&gt;Topolino&lt;/a&gt;\" #3005 (July 2, 2013).\n\"The Provolone Ranger\", an episode of the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Super%20Mario%20Bros.%20Super%20Show%21\"&gt;Super Mario Bros. Super Show&lt;/a&gt;\", featured &lt;a href=\"Mario\"&gt;Mario&lt;/a&gt; donning a mask to fight outlaws alongside of a speedy companion named Pronto. In a spoof of the Lone Ranger's habit of leaving before those whom he has helped can thank him, the episode ends with Mario returning to collect a reward of pasta.\nIn \"Wild West Rangers\", a two-part episode of \"&lt;a href=\"Mighty%20Morphin%20Power%20Rangers\"&gt;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Pink%20Ranger\"&gt;Pink Ranger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kimberly%20Hart\"&gt;Kimberly Hart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Amy%20Jo%20Johnson\"&gt;Amy Jo Johnson&lt;/a&gt;) falls backwards through time to the Old West, where she meets look-alike ancestors of her fellow Power Rangers and other characters in the show. A hero called the White Stranger, a mask-less duplicate of Kimberly's boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Oliver\"&gt;Tommy Oliver&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"White%20Ranger\"&gt;White Ranger&lt;/a&gt; (played by &lt;a href=\"Jason%20David%20Frank\"&gt;Jason David Frank&lt;/a&gt;) rides to the rescue on more than one occasion when danger threatens.\nIn \"Who Was That Mashed Man\", a 1987 episode from the fifth season of \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20Court\"&gt;Night Court&lt;/a&gt;\", an old actor who had played a Lone Ranger-esque character named the Red Ranger was being sued to prevent his appearing in public in costume by a movie company seeking to release a new movie based on the Red Ranger.\nIn \"\" (1998), the sixth film in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Land%20Before%20Time%20%28franchise%29\"&gt;The Land Before Time franchise&lt;/a&gt;\", Littlefoot's grandfather tells the children, the legend about \"The Lone Dinosaur\", a legendary Longneck who protected the Great Valley from the most ferocious Sharptooth to ever live. During the fight, the Sharptooth was killed and the Lone Dinosaur suffered a scar across his right eye. Soon after the battle, a huge &lt;a href=\"monolith\"&gt;monolith&lt;/a&gt; resembling a sauropod with life-sized Sharptooth teeth arranged around his neck came out of the ground during an &lt;a href=\"earthquake\"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"The%20Land%20Before%20Time%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; Doc returns in the first episode of the second series, in search of his lady friend, Dara.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Veggietales\"&gt;Veggietales&lt;/a&gt;\", there is an episode that is a retelling of the story of &lt;a href=\"Moses\"&gt;Moses&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Exodus%20from%20Egypt\"&gt;leading the Hebrews&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Exodus\"&gt;Book of Exodus&lt;/a&gt; from the Bible and a sequel to the Ballad of Little Joe and a parody of the Lone Ranger called \"Moe and the Big Exit\" with &lt;a href=\"Larry%20the%20Cucumber\"&gt;Larry the Cucumber&lt;/a&gt; as the Lone Stranger who is the parody of the Lone Ranger and is the episodes equivalent to the Bible's Moses in the episode.\nOwnership.\nFrom its inception, George W. Trendle had legal ownership of the Lone Ranger and characters associated with the Lone Ranger through his company, The Lone Ranger, Inc. Trendle sold The Lone Ranger, Inc. to oil man and film producer &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Wrather\"&gt;Jack Wrather&lt;/a&gt; in 1954 for $3 million. After Wrather died in 1984, his widow, &lt;a href=\"Bonita%20Granville\"&gt;Bonita Granville&lt;/a&gt;, sold the Wrather Productions properties to Southbrook International Television Co. in 1985 for $10 million. &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20Video\"&gt;Broadway Video&lt;/a&gt; acquired the rights in 1994. &lt;a href=\"Classic%20Media\"&gt;Classic Media&lt;/a&gt; acquired the rights in 2000. &lt;a href=\"DreamWorks%20Animation\"&gt;DreamWorks Animation&lt;/a&gt; acquired Classic Media in 2012 and renamed the division &lt;a href=\"DreamWorks%20Classics\"&gt;DreamWorks Classics&lt;/a&gt;, which was acquired by &lt;a href=\"NBCUniversal\"&gt;NBCUniversal&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 for $3.8 billion. Its &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Pictures\"&gt;Universal Pictures&lt;/a&gt; unit currently has the rights to the Lone Ranger.\nPossible inspirations.\nJohn R. Hughes.\nThe character was originally believed to be inspired by Texas Ranger Captain &lt;a href=\"John%20Hughes%20%28lawman%29\"&gt;John R. Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, to whom the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Star%20Ranger\"&gt;The Lone Star Ranger&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Zane%20Grey\"&gt;Zane Grey&lt;/a&gt; was dedicated in 1915. John R. Hughes was born on February 11, 1855, in &lt;a href=\"Henry%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Henry County, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. At 14 years old, he made his way into &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Territory\"&gt;Indian Territory&lt;/a&gt; and lived among the &lt;a href=\"Choctaw\"&gt;Choctaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osage%20Nation\"&gt;Osage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Comanche\"&gt;Comanche&lt;/a&gt;. In 1886, at 31 years old, Hughes killed a number of men for &lt;a href=\"Horse%20theft\"&gt;stealing his and a neighbor's horses&lt;/a&gt;, and for a number of months, trailed the ones whom he did not kill. This would mark his first time actively participating in &lt;a href=\"bounty%20hunter\"&gt;bounty hunter&lt;/a&gt;-like activities. Not long after that in 1887, Hughes assisted Texas Ranger &lt;a href=\"Ira%20Aten\"&gt;Ira Aten&lt;/a&gt; in tracking and killing an &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;escaped murderer&lt;/a&gt;. A month after, he was persuaded to join the ranks of the Rangers and served along the southwest borders of &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and at 38 years old, Hughes became the captain of &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Ranger%20Division\"&gt;Company D. Frontier Battalion&lt;/a&gt;. He went on to &lt;a href=\"Retirement\"&gt;retire&lt;/a&gt; in 1915, after serving 28 years as a Ranger. He was dying and chose to &lt;a href=\"Suicide\"&gt;end his own life&lt;/a&gt; at 92 years old on June 3, 1947, and was buried in &lt;a href=\"Austin%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany could relate John Hughes to being the Lone Ranger due to his career as an actual Texas Ranger, and because he actually lived in Texas, unlike others who have been cited as possibilities. He learned the &lt;a href=\"Native%20American%20languages\"&gt;languages of the Native American tribes&lt;/a&gt; that he lived among for some time, which could make him a more competent ranger when traveling familiar territory to track down criminals and give him the ability to communicate with other native people. He went on to capture and kill many criminals without ever being injured in his 28 years as a Ranger.\nBass Reeves.\nSome have suggested a possible historical inspiration was &lt;a href=\"Bass%20Reeves\"&gt;Bass Reeves&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"African-American\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marshals%20Service\"&gt;deputy U.S. Marshal&lt;/a&gt; west of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;, although he was never a Ranger nor did he ever live in Texas. Reeves was born into slavery in Grayson County, Texas in 1838. Taken by his owner, George Reeves, to join the Civil War. The details surrounding his escape are unclear. Some accounts claim he brutally beat George Reeves during his escape. Bass Reeves spent the remainder of the war in &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Territory%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Indian Territory&lt;/a&gt;, in what would become Oklahoma.\nAfter the Civil War, Reeves was appointed as a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marshals%20Service\"&gt;U.S. Marshal&lt;/a&gt; in Indian Territory. This was uncommon for freedmen, especially in the South due to the &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Crow%20laws\"&gt;Jim Crow&lt;/a&gt; laws of the &lt;a href=\"Reconstruction%20era\"&gt;Reconstruction Era&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Reeves worked as a Marshal for 32 years before he took a job in the &lt;a href=\"Muskogee%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Muskogee Police Department&lt;/a&gt; in 1907. This did not last long, however, as Reeves was diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"Bright%27s%20disease\"&gt;Bright's disease&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually took his life in 1910. Bass Reeves is buried in Union Agency Cemetery in Muskogee, Oklahoma.\nSpeculation of Reeves' inspiration for the Lone Ranger originated in a 2006 Reeves biography by historian Art T. Burton, \"Black Gun, Silver Star.\" Burton wrote, \"Bass Reeves is the closest real person to resemble the Lone Ranger.\" Burton documents that Reeves' career as a lawman was widely known and celebrated in his time and cites many similarities between Reeves and the Lone Ranger. Among those were: wearing disguises, having a Native American partner, riding a white or grey horse, giving out silver keepsakes, and possessing legendary marksmanship and horsemanship skills. This theory is disputed for a number of reasons. Among them was the common practice of U.S. Marshals working in Indian territories to have Indian assistants. Another widespread practice of that era was using silver dollars as payments or tributes. Critics of the Bass theory also point out that it was common for pulp fiction writers to portray heroes as masked individuals. Other suggested inspirations were &lt;a href=\"Zorro\"&gt;Zorro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robin%20Hood\"&gt;Robin Hood&lt;/a&gt;."
