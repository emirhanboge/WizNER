    "text": "The Salt Lake City and County Building, usually called the \"City-County Building\", is the seat of government for &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20City\"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Utah\"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;. The historic landmark formerly housed offices for &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20County%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Salt Lake County&lt;/a&gt; government as well, hence the name.\nHistory.\nThe building was originally constructed by free masons between 1891 and 1894 to house offices for the city and county of Salt Lake and replace the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20City%20Council%20Hall\"&gt;Salt Lake City Council Hall&lt;/a&gt; and Salt Lake County Courthouse, both erected in the 1860s.\nConstruction of the building was riddled with controversy. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the City and County Building was the symbol of non-Mormon citizens' open defiance of &lt;a href=\"The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints\"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt;. It was designed to rival the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20Temple\"&gt;Salt Lake Temple&lt;/a&gt; as the city's architectural centerpiece. It is even thought that the building's &lt;a href=\"clock%20tower\"&gt;clock tower&lt;/a&gt; and statues were designed to mimic the temple's spires and statue of the &lt;a href=\"angel%20Moroni\"&gt;angel Moroni&lt;/a&gt;. Ironically, the building was originally the 1880s brainchild of the Church-backed \"&lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20%28Utah%29\"&gt;People's Party&lt;/a&gt;.\" When the non-Mormon \"&lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28Utah%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;\" was campaigning for city government, they deemed the proposed \"joint building\" an example of the Church's extravagance and wastefulness. In a reversal of stance, the Liberals decided to go ahead with the building when they finally gained power in 1890. Construction began in February on State Street at about 100 South.\nFor nebulous reasons, construction was halted that November after only the foundation had been laid. The mostly non-Mormon city council questioned the buildings plans which had been completed during the People's Party reign, and wavered on how to proceed. The \"&lt;a href=\"Deseret%20News\"&gt;Deseret News&lt;/a&gt;\" complained that the Liberals were wasting taxpayer money. Ultimately, the original plans and site for the building were scrapped and the whole project was moved to the building's current location at &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20City%20and%20County%20Building%23Washington%20Square\"&gt;Washington Square&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Deseret News\" claimed this move served the City Council, which owned property around the site and would profit from increased land values. Nonetheless construction on new plans began by late 1891. The cornerstone was laid July 25, 1892. Mormon president Wilford Woodruff's journals reported his attendance at the building's dedication on Dec, 28 1894.\nThe architectural firm of Monheim, Bird, and Proudfoot designed the &lt;a href=\"Richardsonian%20Romanesque\"&gt;Richardsonian Romanesque&lt;/a&gt; (Olpin et al., 2005) building. &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Monheim\"&gt;Henry Monheim&lt;/a&gt;, a local architect since the 1870s, and &lt;a href=\"Proudfoot%20and%20Bird\"&gt;George W. Bird and Willis T. Proudfoot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wichita%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Wichita, Kansas&lt;/a&gt; established the firm in 1891 specifically to design the building. Their firm won a building design contest against fourteen other submissions. However, \"The Salt Lake Herald\"\u2014another LDS-backed paper\u2014claimed that the competition was a \"pretentious fraud.\" Monheim, a &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;n immigrant, died one year into construction. Bird and Proudfoot moved to &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; respectively by 1896, so the City-County Building was their firm's only output.\nThe building was monstrously over budget. Estimated by the firm at $350,000, the winning contractor bid $377,978, but by the building's dedication on December 28, 1894, it had cost nearly $900,000. Complicating matters was the &lt;a href=\"Panic%20of%201893\"&gt;Panic of 1893&lt;/a&gt; which cut Salt Lake City and County revenues nearly in half. As a result of this, plans for large &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt; windows for the building were discarded.\nAlthough now used exclusively by Salt Lake City government, the building originally served many functions. Salt Lake County offices called the structure home until the 1980s when the County elected to build a new complex at 2100 South and State Street.\nThe building served as Utah's Capitol from when statehood was granted in 1896 until the present &lt;a href=\"Utah%20State%20Capitol\"&gt;Utah State Capitol&lt;/a&gt; was completed in 1915. The Salt Lake City and County building also housed Salt Lake's first public library and contained courtrooms, including one that condemned organizer &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Hill%20%28activist%29\"&gt;Joe Hill&lt;/a&gt; to death amid international attention in 1914.\nFrom 1973 to 1989 the building was exhaustively renovated and repaired with an eye toward historical accuracy. This was done in concert with a seismic upgrade called &lt;a href=\"base%20isolation\"&gt;base isolation&lt;/a&gt; that placed the weak sandstone structure on a foundation of &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rubber\"&gt;rubber&lt;/a&gt; to better protect it from earthquake damage.\nFeatures.\nThe Salt Lake City and County Building's central &lt;a href=\"clock%20tower\"&gt;clock tower&lt;/a&gt; is topped with a statue of &lt;a href=\"Historical%20Columbia\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt; and rises 256 feet (78\u00a0m) from the ground. The building's primary axis runs north-south, and large entrances mark each &lt;a href=\"cardinal%20direction\"&gt;cardinal direction&lt;/a&gt;. On the south wing (over the Mayor's office) is a bronze statue of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Themis\"&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, the building had statues depicting &lt;a href=\"Commerce\"&gt;Commerce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20%28goddess%29\"&gt;Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, Justice, and Columbia, but the others were removed following a 1934 earthquake. Columbia and the other missing statues were replaced on top of the building when it was renovated in 1989.\nThe building's surface is elaborately carved from the gray Utah Kyune &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; it's made of. To the right of the entrance on the south side is the face of &lt;a href=\"Pierre-Jean%20De%20Smet\"&gt;Father DeSmet&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Jesuit\"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt; priest who preached to &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; and had contact with the &lt;a href=\"Latter-day%20Saint\"&gt;Latter-day Saint&lt;/a&gt;s before and after they traveled to Utah. To the left is Captain &lt;a href=\"Garc%C3%ADa%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20C%C3%A1rdenas\"&gt;Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas&lt;/a&gt; who explored Southern Utah by 1540. Above the &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt; columns on the east and west sides of the building are carvings of pioneer women. Between the portal and balcony are portraits of &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Joseph\"&gt;Chief Joseph&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walkara\"&gt;Chief Wakara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Bridger\"&gt;Jim Bridger&lt;/a&gt;. Above the west entrance left-to-right are &lt;a href=\"R.%20N.%20Baskin\"&gt;R. N. Baskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mayor%20of%20Salt%20Lake%20City\"&gt;mayor of Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt; circa 1894, &lt;a href=\"Jedediah%20M.%20Grant\"&gt;Jedediah M. Grant&lt;/a&gt;, Salt Lake's first mayor, and &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20B.%20Blair\"&gt;Jacob B. Blair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"federal%20judge\"&gt;federal judge&lt;/a&gt;. The north side features a depiction of the &lt;a href=\"Dom%C3%ADnguez%E2%80%93Escalante%20expedition\"&gt;Dom\u00ednguez\u2013Escalante expedition&lt;/a&gt; which entered Utah in 1776 and named many of the state's physical features. &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sea%20monster\"&gt;sea monster&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"beehive%20%28beekeeping%29\"&gt;beehives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freemasonry%23Ritual%20and%20symbolism\"&gt;Masonic icons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;s, and other symbols dot the building's rich exterior.\nWalter Baird and Oswald Lendi carved most of the building's features. Lendi, a French sculptor, whimsically carved his face between the words \"City\" and \"Hall\" above the north entrance.\nThe building has five floors and over one hundred rooms. &lt;a href=\"Onyx\"&gt;Onyx&lt;/a&gt; lines the hall of each lavishly decorated floor. The third floor houses the mayor's office in the south wing and the city council chambers in the north. The council meeting room features an 1865 life-sized portrait of &lt;a href=\"Brigham%20Young\"&gt;Brigham Young&lt;/a&gt;. Portraits of the city's past mayors up to and including Ross \"Rocky\" Anderson line the corridor between these offices. The third floor features an exhibit commemorating the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;2002 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; held in Salt Lake City.\nAround the time of the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics, and for a limited time, an electric display depicting the Olympic rings was allowed to be displayed on four sides of the central tower of the City and County building. The Olympic display has since been removed from the building.\nWashington Square.\nThe City-County Building sits between State Street, Second East, Fourth South, and Fifth South in Salt Lake City, a block called \"Washington Square.\" Named for &lt;a href=\"George%20Washington\"&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt;, the block is the site of the original 1847 &lt;a href=\"Mormon%20pioneers\"&gt;Mormon pioneers&lt;/a&gt;' camp in Salt Lake City."
