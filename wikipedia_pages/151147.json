    "text": "New Braunfels ( ) is a city in &lt;a href=\"Comal%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Comal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guadalupe%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Guadalupe&lt;/a&gt; counties in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; known for its &lt;a href=\"German%20Texan\"&gt;German Texan&lt;/a&gt; heritage. It is the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;seat&lt;/a&gt; of Comal County. The city covers and has a 2019 census-estimated population of 90,209. A suburb just north of San Antonio, and part of the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20San%20Antonio\"&gt;Greater San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan area, it was the third-fastest-growing city in the United States from 2010-2020.\nHistory.\nNew Braunfels was established in 1845 by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Carl%20of%20Solms-Braunfels\"&gt;Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels&lt;/a&gt;, Commissioner General of the &lt;a href=\"Mainzer%20Adelsverein\"&gt;Mainzer Adelsverein&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Noblemen's Society. Prince Carl named the settlement in honor of his home of &lt;a href=\"Solms-Braunfels\"&gt;Solms-Braunfels&lt;/a&gt;, Germany.\nThe Adelsverein organized hundreds of people in Germany to settle in Texas. Immigrants from Germany began arriving at &lt;a href=\"Galveston%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Galveston&lt;/a&gt; in July 1844. Most then traveled by ship to &lt;a href=\"Indianola%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Indianola&lt;/a&gt; in December 1844, and began the overland journey to the Fisher-Miller land grant purchased by Prince Carl. At the urging of &lt;a href=\"John%20Coffee%20Hays\"&gt;John Coffee Hays&lt;/a&gt;, who realized the settlers would not have time to build homes and plant crops further inland before winter, and as the German settlers were traveling inland along the Guadalupe River, they stopped near the &lt;a href=\"Comal%20Springs\"&gt;Comal Springs&lt;/a&gt;. Prince Carl bought two leagues of land from Rafael Garza and Maria Antonio Veramendi Garza for $1,111.00.\nThe land was located northeast of &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio\"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"El%20Camino%20Real%20de%20los%20Tejas%20National%20Historic%20Trail\"&gt;El Camino Real de los Tejas&lt;/a&gt; and had the strong freshwater Comal Springs, known as \"Las Fontanas\", when the Germans arrived. It was about halfway between Indianola and the lower portions of the Fisher-Miller land grant. The first settlers forded the &lt;a href=\"Guadalupe%20River%20%28Texas%29\"&gt;Guadalupe River&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Good%20Friday\"&gt;Good Friday&lt;/a&gt;, March 21, 1845, near the present-day Faust Street bridge.\nAs the spring of 1845 progressed, the settlers built the \"Zinkenburg\", a fort named for Adelsverein civil engineer &lt;a href=\"Nicolaus%20Zink\"&gt;Nicolaus Zink&lt;/a&gt;, divided the land, and began building homes and planting crops. Prince Carl would also lay the cornerstone for the Sophienburg, a permanent fort and center for the immigrant association.\nIn 1844, Prince Carl was so disillusioned with the logistics of the colonization that he asked the Verein to remove him as commissioner-general and appoint a successor. When &lt;a href=\"John%20O.%20Meusebach\"&gt;John O. Meusebach&lt;/a&gt; arrived, the finances were in disarray, due in part to Prince Carl's lack of business experience and his refusal to keep financial records. To a larger degree, the financial situation happened because the Adelsverein was an organization of noblemen with no practical backgrounds at running businesses. They were on the other side of the world and did not witness the situation with which both Prince Carl and Meusebach were dealing. &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Francis%20Fisher\"&gt;Henry Francis Fisher&lt;/a&gt; had not supplied transport and supplies for which the Verein advanced money to him. Meusebach found Prince Carl in Galveston trying to return to Germany, detained by authorities for unpaid bills. Meusebach made good on the debts, so Prince Carl could depart.\nMeusebach discovered that Prince Carl's choice of the inadequate Carlshafen (Indianola) as a port of entry, as well as the isolated route to New Braunfels, was deliberately chosen to keep the Germans from interacting with any Americans. According to Nicolaus Zink, Prince Carl had planned to establish a German feudal state by secretly bringing in immigrants and placing them in military fortresses. Meusebach, who had renounced his own title of nobility, took a different approach and invited Americans to settle in the Vereins territory.\nPrince Carl, being an officer of the Imperial Army of &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, had kept a uniformed military unit at the ready in Indianola. Meusebach converted the military unit to a more needed work detail. A finance and business structure for the colony was put in place by Meusebach. He also provided for adequate food and shelter for the colonists. On August 11, 1845, Hermann Friedrich Seele became the first teacher for the German-English school in New Braunfels. Meusebach established friendly relations with a local tribe of &lt;a href=\"Waco%20tribe\"&gt;Waco Indians&lt;/a&gt;. Upon seeing his reddish-blonde hair, they called him \"Ma-be-quo-si-to-mu\", \"Chief with the burning hair of the head\".\nIn May 1846, Meusebach received a letter from Count Castell informing him 4,304 emigrants were on their way to Texas. With no funds and no new settlements, the mass of emigrants was stalled at Carlshafen. Meusebach's requests to the Verein for more money, and his warnings of pending bankruptcy for the Verein, brought no results. As a last resort, Meusebach instructed D.H. Klaener to publish the plight in the German news media. Embarrassed by the publicity, the Verein established a $60,000 letter of credit. The amount was not adequate for sustaining the total number of German emigrants in Texas, but Castell also sent Philip Cappes as special commissioner to observe the situation. Cappes had also been instructed by Castell to observe Meusebach and to secretly report back every detail. By the time Cappes departed in March 1847, he recommended another $200,000 be advanced.\nCappes invited Henry Francis Fisher to New Braunfels, in spite of Fisher not being entirely trustworthy to the Verein. As of February 11, 1845, Fisher had been involved in coercing newly arrived immigrants to sign documents stating their intent to depart from the Verein and align with Fisher's friend Dr. Friedrich Schubbert, also known as Friedrich Strubberg.\n Cappes was not in town when Meusebach was breakfast host to Fisher on December 31, 1846. Posters had mysteriously appeared about town maligning Meusebach, saying \"Curses upon Meusebach the slave driver\", and inciting colonists to free themselves from his \"tyranny\". A group led by Rudolph Iwonski pushed their way into Meusebach's home, and colonist C. Herber brandished a whip. Herber was an alleged counterfeiter to whom Count Castell had awarded asylum. Meusebach and Herber shared a dislike of one another.\nThe colonists' list of demands included Meusebach resigning as commissioner-general and turning the colonization over to Fisher. Meusebach kept his composure, but the group became so heated, they yelled, \"Hang him!\" When the estimated 120 men dispersed, Fisher was nowhere to be found. The same evening, a different group of individuals assembled and pledged to stand by Meusebach, the next day passing resolutions condemning the actions of the mob. Meusebach himself had considered leaving Texas as early as November 1845, when he wrote to Count Castell and announced his intention to resign and return to Germany. Meusebach did not feel the Adelsverein was organized enough to achieve its goals. After the mob visit in New Braunfels, he again submitted his resignation to accompany a financial report to Castell on January 23, 1847.\nMeusebach had arranged with the Torrey Brothers for transporting the emigrants inland, but the United States hired the Torrey Brothers for use in the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Mexican\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeusebach stabilized the community's finances, and encouraged the settlers to establish additional neighboring communities. The largest of these secondary settlements was &lt;a href=\"Fredericksburg%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Fredericksburg&lt;/a&gt;, to the northwest of New Braunfels.\nNew Braunfels thrived, and by 1850, it was the fourth-largest city in Texas, with 1,723 people, following only Galveston, San Antonio, and Houston in population. In 1852, the \"Zeitung\" newspaper was established, edited by &lt;a href=\"German%20Texan\"&gt;German Texan&lt;/a&gt; botanist &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Lindheimer\"&gt;Ferdinand Lindheimer&lt;/a&gt;. The newspaper continues to publish under its current name, the \"&lt;a href=\"Herald-Zeitung\"&gt;Herald-Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGeography.\nNew Braunfels is located in southeastern Comal County. The city is northeast of &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20San%20Antonio\"&gt;Downtown San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, southwest of &lt;a href=\"San%20Marcos%2C%20Texas\"&gt;San Marcos&lt;/a&gt;, and southwest of &lt;a href=\"Austin%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, New Braunfels has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.91%, is covered by water. The city is situated along the &lt;a href=\"Balcones%20Fault\"&gt;Balcones Fault&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Hill%20Country\"&gt;Texas Hill Country&lt;/a&gt; meets rolling prairie land. Along the fault in the city, a string of artesian springs known as &lt;a href=\"Comal%20Springs\"&gt;Comal Springs&lt;/a&gt; gives rise to the &lt;a href=\"Comal%20River\"&gt;Comal River&lt;/a&gt;, which is known as one of the shortest rivers in the world, as it winds through the city before meeting the Guadalupe River.\nGruene.\n&lt;a href=\"Gruene%2C%20New%20Braunfels%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Gruene Historical District&lt;/a&gt; is located within the city limits of New Braunfels. Founded by the sons of settlers Ernst and Antoinette Gruene, the community had a bank, post office, school, general store, lumberyard, gristmill, dance hall, and cotton gin. It also had access to two railways for shipping cotton bales. Its most famous attribute was the dance hall, a family activity in those days. Due to the failure of the cotton crop from &lt;a href=\"boll%20weevil\"&gt;boll weevil&lt;/a&gt;s, and the failure of the banks after 1929, commercial activity slowed to a crawl. This village is now a Nationally Registered Historic District where one can dine in the ruins of the original gristmill or enjoy live music at &lt;a href=\"Gruene%20Hall\"&gt;Gruene Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nNew Braunfels experiences a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt;, with hot, humid summers and generally mild winters.

New Braunfels and &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio\"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, to the southwest, are some of the most flood-prone regions in North America. The &lt;a href=\"October%201998%20Central%20Texas%20floods\"&gt;October 1998 Central Texas floods&lt;/a&gt; were among the costliest floods in United States history, resulting in $750 million in damage and 32 deaths.
