    "text": "The Rashidun Caliphate () was the first of the four major &lt;a href=\"caliphate\"&gt;caliphate&lt;/a&gt;s established after the death of the &lt;a href=\"Prophets%20and%20messengers%20in%20Islam\"&gt;Islamic prophet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Muhammad\"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;. It was ruled by the first four successive &lt;a href=\"caliphs\"&gt;caliphs&lt;/a&gt; (successors) of Muhammad after his death in 632 CE (&lt;a href=\"Hijri%20year\"&gt;AH&lt;/a&gt; 11). These caliphs are collectively known in &lt;a href=\"Sunni%20Islam\"&gt;Sunni Islam&lt;/a&gt; as the \"&lt;a href=\"Rashidun\"&gt;Rashidun&lt;/a&gt;\", or \"Rightly Guided\" caliphs (, \"\"). This term is not used in &lt;a href=\"Shia%20Islam\"&gt;Shia Islam&lt;/a&gt;, as Shia Muslims do not consider the rule of the first three caliphs legitimate.\nThe Rashidun Caliphate is characterized by a twenty-five-year period of rapid &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20conquests\"&gt;military expansion&lt;/a&gt; followed by a five-year period of &lt;a href=\"First%20Fitna\"&gt;internal strife&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Rashidun%20Army\"&gt;Rashidun Army&lt;/a&gt; numbered more than 100,000 men at its peak. By the 650s, in addition to the &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Arabian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, the caliphate had subjugated the &lt;a href=\"Levant\"&gt;Levant&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Transcaucasus\"&gt;Transcaucasus&lt;/a&gt; in the north; &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; to present-day &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt; in the west; and the &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20Plateau\"&gt;Iranian Plateau&lt;/a&gt; to parts of &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt; in the east. The four Rashidun caliphs were chosen by a small electoral body consisting of prominent members of the &lt;a href=\"Quraysh\"&gt;Quraysh&lt;/a&gt; tribal confederation called (, ).\nThe caliphate arose out of the death of Muhammad in 632 CE and the subsequent debate over the &lt;a href=\"Succession%20to%20Muhammad\"&gt;succession to his leadership&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Bakr\"&gt;Abu Bakr&lt;/a&gt;, a close &lt;a href=\"companion%20of%20Muhammad\"&gt;companion of Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Banu%20Taym\"&gt;Banu Taym&lt;/a&gt; clan, was elected the first Rashidun leader and began the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Muslim%20conquests\"&gt;conquest of the Arabian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. He ruled from 632 to his death in 634. Abu Bakr was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Umar\"&gt;Umar&lt;/a&gt;, his appointed successor from the &lt;a href=\"Banu%20Adi\"&gt;Banu Adi&lt;/a&gt; clan, who continued the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Persia\"&gt;conquest of Persia&lt;/a&gt;, eventually leading to the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Sasanian Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 651. Umar was assassinated in 644 by a &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Lu%27lu%27a%20Firuz\"&gt;Persian slave&lt;/a&gt; and was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Uthman\"&gt;Uthman&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Banu%20Umayya\"&gt;Banu Umayya&lt;/a&gt; clan, who was elected by a six-person committee arranged by Umar. Under Uthman, the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20conquest%20of%20Armenia\"&gt;conquest of Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Fars\"&gt;Fars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Khorasan\"&gt;Khorasan&lt;/a&gt; began.\nUthman was assassinated by Egyptian rebels in 656 and succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Ali\"&gt;Ali&lt;/a&gt;, a member of Muhammad's &lt;a href=\"Banu%20Hashim\"&gt;Banu Hashim&lt;/a&gt; clan, who presided over the civil war known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Fitna\"&gt;First Fitna&lt;/a&gt; (656\u2013661). The war was primarily between those who believed Uthman was unlawfully killed, supporting his cousin and governor of the Levant &lt;a href=\"Muawiyah%20I\"&gt;Muawiyah&lt;/a&gt;, and those who believed his killing was deserved, supporting the caliph Ali. The civil war permanently consolidated the divide between Sunni and Shia Muslims, with Shia Muslims believing Ali to be the first rightful caliph and &lt;a href=\"Imamah%20%28Shia%20doctrine%29\"&gt;Imam&lt;/a&gt; after Muhammad, favouring his bloodline connection to Muhammad. Additionally, a third faction in the war believed both Ali and Muawiyah should be deposed and a new caliph elected by \"shura\"; this faction supported the governor of Egypt &lt;a href=\"%27Amr%20ibn%20al-%27As\"&gt;Amr ibn al-As&lt;/a&gt;. The war led to the end of the Rashidun Caliphate and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Umayyad%20Caliphate\"&gt;Umayyad Caliphate&lt;/a&gt; in 661 under Muawiyah.\nOrigin.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Muhammad\"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;'s death in 632 CE, his &lt;a href=\"Medina\"&gt;Medina&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Ansar%20%28Islam%29\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; debated which of them should succeed him in running the affairs of the &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;s while Muhammad's household was busy with his burial. &lt;a href=\"Umar\"&gt;Umar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Ubaidah%20ibn%20al-Jarrah\"&gt;Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah&lt;/a&gt; pledged their loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Bakr\"&gt;Abu Bakr&lt;/a&gt;, with the Ansar and the &lt;a href=\"Quraysh\"&gt;Quraysh&lt;/a&gt; soon following suit. Abu Bakr thus became the first \"Khal\u012bfa\u1e6bu Ras\u016bli l-L\u0101h\" (, \"Successor of the Messenger of God\"), or Caliph, and embarked on campaigns to propagate Islam. First he would have to subdue the Arabian tribes which had claimed that although they pledged allegiance to Muhammad and accepted Islam, they owed nothing to Abu Bakr. As a caliph, Abu Bakr was not a monarch and never claimed such a title; nor did any of his three successors. Rather, their election and leadership were based upon &lt;a href=\"Meritocracy\"&gt;merit&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotably, according to Sunnis, all four Rashidun Caliphs were connected to Muhammad through marriage, were early converts to Islam, were among &lt;a href=\"Hadith%20of%20the%20ten%20promised%20paradise\"&gt;ten who were explicitly promised paradise&lt;/a&gt;, were his closest companions by association and support and were often highly praised by Muhammad and delegated roles of leadership within the nascent Muslim community.\nAccording to Sunni Muslims, the term Rashidun Caliphate is derived from a famous &lt;a href=\"hadith\"&gt;hadith&lt;/a&gt; of Muhammad, where he foretold that the caliphate after him would last for 30 years (the length of the Rashidun Caliphate) and would then be followed by kingship (the Umayyad Caliphate was a hereditary monarchy). Furthermore, according to other hadiths in &lt;a href=\"Sunan%20Abu%20Dawood\"&gt;Sunan Abu Dawood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Musnad%20Ahmad%20ibn%20Hanbal\"&gt;Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal&lt;/a&gt;, towards the end times, the Rightly Guided Caliphate will be restored once again by God.\nHistory.\nSuccession to Muhammad.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the death of Muhammad, a gathering of the &lt;a href=\"Ansar%20%28Islam%29\"&gt;Ansar&lt;/a&gt; (natives of &lt;a href=\"Medina\"&gt;Medina&lt;/a&gt;) took place in the \"Saqifah\" (courtyard) of the &lt;a href=\"Banu%20Sa%27ida\"&gt;Banu Sa'ida&lt;/a&gt; clan. The general belief at the time was that the purpose of the meeting was for the Ansar to decide on a new leader of the &lt;a href=\"Ummah\"&gt;Muslim community&lt;/a&gt; among themselves, with the intentional exclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Muhajirun\"&gt;Muhajirun&lt;/a&gt; (migrants from &lt;a href=\"Mecca\"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt;), though this has later become the subject of debate.\nNevertheless, Abu Bakr and Umar, both prominent companions of Muhammad, upon learning of the meeting became concerned about a potential coup and hastened to the gathering. Upon arriving, Abu Bakr addressed the assembled men with a warning that any attempt to elect a leader outside of Muhammad's own tribe, the &lt;a href=\"Quraysh\"&gt;Quraysh&lt;/a&gt;, would likely result in dissension as only they can command the necessary respect among the community. He then took Umar and another companion, &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Ubaidah%20ibn%20al-Jarrah\"&gt;Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah&lt;/a&gt;, by the hand and offered them to the Ansar as potential choices. He was countered with the suggestion that the Quraysh and the Ansar choose a leader each from among themselves, who would then rule jointly. The group grew heated upon hearing this proposal and began to argue amongst themselves. Umar hastily took Abu Bakr's hand and swore his own allegiance to the latter, an example followed by the gathered men.\nAbu Bakr was near-universally accepted as head of the Muslim community (under the title of Caliph) as a result of Saqifah, though he did face contention as a result of the rushed nature of the event. Several companions, most prominent among them being &lt;a href=\"Ali%20ibn%20Abi%20Talib\"&gt;Ali ibn Abi Talib&lt;/a&gt;, initially refused to acknowledge his authority. Ali may have been reasonably expected to assume leadership, being both cousin and son-in-law to Muhammad. The theologian &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20al-Nakhai\"&gt;Ibrahim al-Nakhai&lt;/a&gt; stated that Ali also had support among the Ansar for his succession, explained by the genealogical links he shared with them. Whether his candidacy for the succession was raised during Saqifah is unknown, though it is not unlikely. Abu Bakr later sent Umar to confront Ali to gain his allegiance, resulting in &lt;a href=\"Umar%20at%20Fatimah%27s%20house\"&gt;an altercation&lt;/a&gt; which may have involved violence. However, after six months the group made peace with Abu Bakr and Ali offered him his fealty.\nAbu Bakr's rule.\nTroubles emerged soon after Muhammad's death, threatening the unity and stability of the new community and state. Apostasy spread to every tribe in the &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Arabian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; with the exception of the people in &lt;a href=\"Mecca\"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Medina\"&gt;Medina&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Banu%20Thaqif\"&gt;Banu Thaqif&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ta%27if\"&gt;Ta'if&lt;/a&gt; and the Bani Abdul Qais of &lt;a href=\"Oman\"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, entire tribes apostatized. Others merely withheld &lt;a href=\"zakat\"&gt;zakat&lt;/a&gt;, the alms tax, without formally challenging Islam. Many tribal leaders made claims to prophethood; some made it during the lifetime of Muhammad. The first incident of &lt;a href=\"apostasy\"&gt;apostasy&lt;/a&gt; was fought and concluded while Muhammad still lived; a supposed prophet &lt;a href=\"Aswad%20Ansi\"&gt;Aswad Ansi&lt;/a&gt; arose and invaded &lt;a href=\"South%20Arabia\"&gt;South Arabia&lt;/a&gt;; he was killed on 30 May 632 (6 Rabi' al-Awwal, 11 Hijri) by Governor F\u0113r\u014dz of Yemen, a Persian Muslim. The news of his death reached Medina shortly after the death of Muhammad. The apostasy of &lt;a href=\"al-Yamama\"&gt;al-Yamama&lt;/a&gt; was led by another supposed prophet, &lt;a href=\"Musaylimah\"&gt;Musaylimah&lt;/a&gt;, who arose before Muhammad's death; other centers of the rebels were in the &lt;a href=\"Najd\"&gt;Najd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Arabia\"&gt;Eastern Arabia&lt;/a&gt; (known then as \"al-Bahrayn\") and &lt;a href=\"South%20Arabia\"&gt;South Arabia&lt;/a&gt; (known as \"al-Yaman\" and including the \"Mahra\"). Many tribes claimed that they had submitted to Muhammad and that with Muhammad's death, their allegiance was ended. Caliph Abu Bakr insisted that they had not just submitted to a leader but joined an \"&lt;a href=\"ummah\"&gt;ummah&lt;/a&gt;\" (, community) of which he was the new head. The result of this situation was the &lt;a href=\"Ridda%20wars\"&gt;Ridda wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbu Bakr planned his strategy accordingly. He divided the Muslim army into several corps. The strongest corps, and the primary force of the Muslims, was the corps of &lt;a href=\"Khalid%20ibn%20al-Walid\"&gt;Khalid ibn al-Walid&lt;/a&gt;. This corps was used to fight the most powerful of the rebel forces. Other corps were given areas of secondary importance in which to bring the less dangerous apostate tribes to submission. Abu Bakr's plan was first to clear Najd and Western Arabia near Medina, then tackle &lt;a href=\"Malik%20ibn%20Nuwayrah\"&gt;Malik ibn Nuwayrah&lt;/a&gt; and his forces between the Najd and al-Bahrayn, and finally concentrate against the most dangerous enemy, Musaylimah and his allies in al-Yamama. After a series of successful campaigns Khalid ibn al-Walid defeated Musaylimah in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Yamama\"&gt;Battle of Yamama&lt;/a&gt;. The Campaign on the Apostasy was fought and completed during the eleventh year of the Hijri. The year 12 Hijri dawned on 18 March 633 with the Arabian peninsula united under the caliph in Medina. \nOnce the rebellions had been put down, Abu Bakr began a war of conquest. Whether or not he intended a full-out imperial conquest is hard to say; he did, however, set in motion a historical trajectory that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20largest%20empires\"&gt;largest empires in history&lt;/a&gt;. Abu Bakr began with &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, the richest province of the &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Sasanian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He sent general Khalid ibn al-Walid to invade the Sassanian Empire in 633. He thereafter also sent four armies to invade the Roman province of &lt;a href=\"Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, but the decisive operation was only undertaken when Khalid, after completing the conquest of Iraq, was transferred to the Syrian front in 634.\nSuccession of Umar.\nDespite the initial reservations of his advisers, Abu Bakr recognised the military and political prowess in &lt;a href=\"Umar\"&gt;Umar&lt;/a&gt; and desired him to succeed as caliph. The decision was enshrined in his will, and on the death of Abu Bakr in 634, Umar was confirmed in office. The new caliph continued the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquests\"&gt;war of conquests&lt;/a&gt; begun by his predecessor, pushing further into the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Persia\"&gt;Sassanian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, north into &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Syria\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; territory, and went into &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. These were regions of great wealth controlled by powerful states, but the long conflict between Byzantines and Persians had left both sides militarily exhausted, and the Islamic armies easily prevailed against them. By 640, they had brought all of &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; under the control of the Rashidun Caliphate; Egypt was conquered by 642, and the entire Sassanian Empire by 643.\nWhile the caliphate continued its rapid expansion, Umar laid the foundations of a political structure that could hold it together. He created the &lt;a href=\"Divan\"&gt;Diwan&lt;/a&gt;, a bureau for transacting government affairs. The military was brought directly under state control and into its pay. Crucially, in conquered lands, Umar did not require that non-Muslim populations convert to Islam, nor did he try to centralize government. Instead, he allowed subject populations to retain their religion, language, and customs, and he left their government relatively untouched, imposing only a governor (\"&lt;a href=\"Emir\"&gt;amir&lt;/a&gt;\") and a financial officer called an \"amil\". These new posts were integral to the efficient network of taxation that financed the empire.\nWith the bounty secured from conquest, Umar was able to support its faith in material ways: the &lt;a href=\"Sahaba\"&gt;companions of Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; were given pensions on which to live, allowing them to pursue religious studies and exercise spiritual leadership in their communities and beyond. Umar is also remembered for establishing the Islamic calendar; it is lunar-like the Arabian calendar, but the origin is set in 622, the year of the Hijra when Muhammad emigrated to &lt;a href=\"Medina\"&gt;Medina&lt;/a&gt;.\nUmar was assassinated by the Persian slave &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Lu%27lu%27a%20Firuz\"&gt;Abu Lu'lu'a Firuz&lt;/a&gt; during morning prayers in 644.\nElection of Uthman.\nBefore Umar died, he appointed a committee of six men to decide on the next caliph and charged them with choosing one of their own numbers. All of the men, like Umar, were from the tribe of Quraysh.\nThe committee narrowed down the choices to two: &lt;a href=\"Uthman\"&gt;Uthman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ali\"&gt;Ali&lt;/a&gt;. Ali was from the Banu Hashim clan (the same clan as Muhammad) of the Quraish tribe, and he was the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad and had been one of his companions from the inception of his mission. Uthman was from the &lt;a href=\"Umayyad\"&gt;Umayyad&lt;/a&gt; clan of the Quraish. He was the second cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad and one of the early converts of Islam. Uthman was ultimately chosen.\nUthman reigned for twelve years as a caliph. During the first half of his reign, he was the most popular caliph among all the &lt;a href=\"Rashidun\"&gt;Rashidun&lt;/a&gt;s, while in the latter half of his reign he met increasing opposition, led by the Egyptians and concentrated around Ali, who would albeit briefly, succeed Uthman as caliph.\nDespite internal troubles, Uthman continued the wars of conquest started by Umar. The &lt;a href=\"Rashidun%20army\"&gt;Rashidun army&lt;/a&gt; conquered &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt;s and even raided &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, conquering the coastal areas of the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20peninsula\"&gt;Iberian peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the islands of &lt;a href=\"Rhodes\"&gt;Rhodes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyprus\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;. Also, coastal &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt; was raided in 652. The Rashidun army fully conquered the Sasanian Empire, and its eastern frontiers extended up to the &lt;a href=\"Indus\"&gt;lower Indus River&lt;/a&gt;.\nUthman's most lasting project was the final compilation of the Qur'an. Under his authority diacritics were written with Arabic letters so that non-native speakers of Arabic could easily read the Qur'an.\nSiege of Uthman.\nAfter a protest turned into a siege on his house, Uthman refused to initiate any military action, in order to avoid civil war between Muslims and preferred to negotiate a peaceful solution. After the negotiations, the protesters returned but found a man following them, holding an order to execute them, at which point, the protesters returned to Uthman's home, bearing the order. Uthman swore that he did not write the order and to talk the protesters down. The protesters responded by demanding he step down as caliph. Uthman refused and returned to his room, whereupon the protesters broke into Uthman's house and killed him while he was reading the &lt;a href=\"Qur%27an\"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt;. It was later discovered that the order to kill the rebels did not, in fact, originate from Uthman, but was, rather, part of a conspiracy to overthrow him.\nCrisis and fragmentation.\nAfter the assassination of the third Caliph, Uthman ibn Affan, the Companions of Muhammad in &lt;a href=\"Medina\"&gt;Medina&lt;/a&gt; selected Ali, who had been passed over for the leadership three times since the death of Muhammad, to be the new Caliph. Soon thereafter, Ali dismissed several provincial governors, some of whom were relatives of Uthman, and replaced them with trusted aides, such as &lt;a href=\"Malik%20al-Ashtar\"&gt;Malik al-Ashtar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salman%20the%20Persian\"&gt;Salman the Persian&lt;/a&gt;. Ali then transferred his capital from Medina to &lt;a href=\"Kufa\"&gt;Kufa&lt;/a&gt;, a Muslim garrison city in current-day Iraq.\nDemands to take revenge for the assassination of Caliph Uthman rose among parts of the population, and a large army of rebels led by &lt;a href=\"Zubayr%20ibn%20al-Awam\"&gt;Zubayr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talha\"&gt;Talha&lt;/a&gt; and the widow of Muhammad, &lt;a href=\"Aisha\"&gt;Aisha&lt;/a&gt;, set out to fight the perpetrators. The army reached Basra and captured it, whereupon 4,000 suspected seditionists were put to death. Subsequently, Ali turned towards Basra and the caliph's army met the rebel army. Though neither Ali nor the leaders of the opposing force, Talha and Zubayr, wanted to fight, a battle broke out at night between the two armies. It is said, according to Sunni Muslim traditions, that those who were involved in the assassination of Uthman initiated combat, as they were afraid that negotiations between Ali and the opposing army would result in their capture and execution. The battle thus fought was the first battle between Muslims and is known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Camel\"&gt;Battle of the Camel&lt;/a&gt;. Ali emerged victoriously and the dispute was settled. The eminent companions of Muhammad, Talha, and Zubayr, were killed in the battle and Ali sent his son &lt;a href=\"Hasan%20ibn%20Ali\"&gt;Hasan ibn Ali&lt;/a&gt; to escort Aisha back to Medina.\nThereafter, there rose another cry for revenge for the blood of Uthman, this time by &lt;a href=\"Muawiyah%20I\"&gt;Mu'awiya&lt;/a&gt;, a kinsman of Uthman and governor of the province of Syria. However, it is regarded more as an attempt by Mu'awiya to assume the caliphate, rather than to take revenge for Uthman's murder. Ali fought Mu'awiya's forces to a stalemate at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Siffin\"&gt;Battle of Siffin&lt;/a&gt;, and then lost a controversial arbitration that ended with the arbiter, &lt;a href=\"%27Amr%20ibn%20al-%27As\"&gt;'Amr ibn al-'As&lt;/a&gt;, pronouncing his support for Mu'awiya. After this Ali was forced to fight the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Nahrawan\"&gt;Battle of Nahrawan&lt;/a&gt; against the rebellious &lt;a href=\"Kharijites\"&gt;Kharijites&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of his former supporters who, as a result of their dissatisfaction with the arbitration, opposed both Ali and Mu'awiya. Weakened by this internal rebellion and a lack of popular support in many provinces, Ali's forces lost control over most of the caliphate's territory to Mu'awiya while large sections of the empire\u2014such as &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt;, the coastal areas of &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and some forts in &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolia&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were also lost to outside empires.\nIn 661, Ali was assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20Muljam\"&gt;Ibn Muljam&lt;/a&gt; as part of a Kharijite plot to assassinate all the different Islamic leaders in an attempt to end the civil war, but the Kharijites failed to assassinate Mu'awiya and 'Amr ibn al-'As.\nAli's son Hasan ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad, briefly assumed the caliphate and came to an agreement with Mu'awiya to fix relations between the two groups of Muslims that were each loyal to one of the two men. The treaty stated that Mu'awiya would not name a successor during his reign, and that he would let the Islamic world choose the next leader (this treaty would later be broken by Mu'awiya as he named his son Yazid I successor). Hasan was assassinated, and Mu'awiya founded the &lt;a href=\"Umayyad%20Caliphate\"&gt;Umayyad Caliphate&lt;/a&gt;, supplanting the Rashidun Caliphate.\nMilitary expansion.\nThe Rashidun Caliphate expanded steadily; within the span of 24 years, a vast territory was conquered comprising &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Levant\"&gt;Levant&lt;/a&gt;, parts of &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolia&lt;/a&gt;, and most of the &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Sasanian Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike the Sasanian &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20people\"&gt;Persians&lt;/a&gt;, the Byzantines, after losing Syria, retreated back to Anatolia. As a result, they also lost &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; to the invading Rashidun army, although the civil wars among the Muslims halted the war of conquest for many years, and this gave time for the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt; to recover.\nConquest of the Sasanian Empire.\nThe first Islamic invasion of the Sasanian Empire, launched by Caliph Abu Bakr in 633, was a swift conquest, taking only four months. Abu Bakr sent his general, Khalid ibn al-Walid, to conquer &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Ridda%20wars\"&gt;Ridda wars&lt;/a&gt;. After entering Iraq with his army of 18,000, Khalid won decisive victories in four consecutive battles: the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Chains\"&gt;Battle of Chains&lt;/a&gt;, fought in April 633; the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20River\"&gt;Battle of River&lt;/a&gt;, fought in the third week of April 633; the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Walaja\"&gt;Battle of Walaja&lt;/a&gt;, fought in May 633 (where he successfully used a &lt;a href=\"pincer%20movement\"&gt;pincer movement&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ullais\"&gt;Battle of Ullais&lt;/a&gt;, fought in mid-May of 633. In the last week of May 633, the capital city of Iraq fell to the Muslims after initial resistance in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hira\"&gt;Battle of Hira&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter resting his armies, Khalid moved in June 633 towards &lt;a href=\"Anbar%20%28town%29\"&gt;Anbar&lt;/a&gt;, which resisted and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Al-Anbar\"&gt;was defeated&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually surrendered after a siege of a few weeks in July 633. Khalid then moved towards the south, and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20ein-ul-tamr\"&gt;conquered the city of Ein ul Tamr&lt;/a&gt; in the last week of July 633. By now, almost the whole of Iraq was under Islamic control. Khalid received a call for help from Daumat-ul-jandal in Northern Arabia, where another Muslim general, &lt;a href=\"Iyad%20ibn%20Ghanm\"&gt;Iyad ibn Ghanm&lt;/a&gt;, was trapped among the rebel tribes. Khalid diverted there and defeated the rebels in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Daumat-ul-jandal\"&gt;Battle of Daumat-ul-jandal&lt;/a&gt; in the last week of August 633. Returning from Arabia, he received news that a large Persian army was assembling. Within a few weeks, he decided to defeat them piecemeal in order to avoid the risk of defeat by a large unified Persian army. Four divisions of Persian and &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; Arab auxiliaries were present at Hanafiz, Zumiel, Sanni, and Muzieh.\nIn November 633, Khalid divided his army into three units, and attacked these auxiliaries one by one from three different sides at night, starting with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Muzieh\"&gt;Battle of Muzieh&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sanni\"&gt;Battle of Sanni&lt;/a&gt;, and finally the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Zumail\"&gt;Battle of Zumail&lt;/a&gt;. These devastating defeats ended Persian control over Iraq. In December 633, Khalid reached the border city of Firaz, where he defeated the combined forces of the &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20the%20Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Sasanian Persians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20army\"&gt;Byzantines&lt;/a&gt; and Christian Arabs in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firaz\"&gt;Battle of Firaz&lt;/a&gt;. This was the last battle in his conquest of Iraq.\nKhalid then left Mesopotamia to lead another campaign in Syria against the Byzantine Empire, after which Mithna ibn Haris took command in Mesopotamia. The Persians once again concentrated armies to regain &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt;, while Mithna ibn Haris withdrew from central Iraq to the region near the &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20desert\"&gt;Arabian desert&lt;/a&gt; to delay war until reinforcement came from Medina. Umar sent reinforcements under the command of &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Ubayd%20al-Thaqafi\"&gt;Abu Ubayd al-Thaqafi&lt;/a&gt;. This army was defeated by the Sasanian army at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bridge\"&gt;Battle of the Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in which Abu Ubaid was killed. The response was delayed until after a decisive Muslim victory against the Romans in the &lt;a href=\"Levant\"&gt;Levant&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Yarmouk\"&gt;Battle of Yarmouk&lt;/a&gt; in 636. Umar was then able to transfer forces to the east and resume the offensive against the Sasanians. Umar dispatched 36,000 men along with 7500 troops from the Syrian front, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Sa%27ad%20ibn%20Abi%20Waqqas\"&gt;Sa`d ibn Ab\u012b Waqq\u0101s&lt;/a&gt; against the Persian army. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20al-Q%C4%81disiyyah\"&gt;Battle of al-Q\u0101disiyyah&lt;/a&gt; followed, with the Persians prevailing at first, but, on the third day of fighting, the Muslims gained the upper hand. The legendary Persian general &lt;a href=\"Rostam%20Farrokhz%C4%81d\"&gt;Rostam Farrokhz\u0101d&lt;/a&gt; was killed during the battle. According to some sources, the Persian losses were 20,000, and the Arabs lost 10,500 men.\nFollowing this Battle, the Arab Muslim armies pushed forward toward the Persian capital of &lt;a href=\"Ctesiphon\"&gt;Ctesiphon&lt;/a&gt; (also called Mad\u0101'in in Arabic), which was quickly evacuated by Yazdgird after a &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Ctesiphon%20%28637%29\"&gt;brief siege&lt;/a&gt;. After seizing the city, they continued their drive eastwards, following Yazdgird and his remaining troops. Within a short span of time, the Arab armies defeated a major Sasanian counter-attack in the Battle of Jal\u016bl\u0101', as well as other engagements at &lt;a href=\"Qasr-e%20Shirin\"&gt;Qasr-e Shirin&lt;/a&gt;, and Masabadhan. By the mid-7th century, the Arabs controlled all of Mesopotamia, including the area that is now the Iranian province of &lt;a href=\"Khuzestan\"&gt;Khuzestan&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that Caliph Umar did not wish to send his troops through the &lt;a href=\"Zagros%20mountains\"&gt;Zagros mountains&lt;/a&gt; and onto the Iranian plateau. One tradition has it that he wished for a \"wall of fire\" to keep the Arabs and Persians apart. Later commentators explain this as a common-sense precaution against over-extension of his forces. The Arabs had only recently conquered large territories that still had to be garrisoned and administered. The continued existence of the Persian government was, however, incitement to revolt in the conquered territories and unlike the Byzantine army, the Sasanian army was continuously striving to regain their lost territories. Finally, Umar pressed forward, which eventually resulted in the wholesale conquest of the Sasanian Empire. Yazdegerd, the Sasanian king, made yet another effort to regroup and defeat the invaders. By 641 he had raised a new force, which made a stand at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Nihaw%C4%81nd\"&gt;Battle of Nihaw\u0101nd&lt;/a&gt;, some forty miles south of &lt;a href=\"Hamadan\"&gt;Hamadan&lt;/a&gt; in modern &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. The Rashidun army, under the command of Umar's appointed general Nu'man ibn Muqarrin al-Muzani, attacked and again defeated the Persian forces. The Muslims proclaimed it the Victory of Victories (Fath alfotuh), as it marked the End of the &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Sasanians&lt;/a&gt;, shattering the last strongest Sasanian army.\n&lt;a href=\"Yazdegerd%20III\"&gt;Yazdegerd&lt;/a&gt; was unable to raise another army and became a hunted fugitive. In 642 Umar sent the army to conquer the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"Persian%20Empire\"&gt;Persian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The entirety of present-day &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; was conquered, followed by &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Khorasan\"&gt;Greater Khorasan&lt;/a&gt; (which included the modern Iranian Khorasan province and modern &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Transoxania\"&gt;Transoxania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balochistan%20%28region%29\"&gt;Balochistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Makran\"&gt;Makran&lt;/a&gt; (part of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dagestan\"&gt;Dagestan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;; these regions were later re-conquered during Uthman's reign with further expansion into the regions which were not conquered during Umar's reign; hence, the Rashidun Caliphate's frontiers in the east extended to the &lt;a href=\"Indus\"&gt;lower river Indus&lt;/a&gt; and north to the &lt;a href=\"Amu%20Darya\"&gt;Oxus River&lt;/a&gt;.\nWars against the Byzantine Empire.\nConquest of Byzantine Syria.\nAfter Khalid consolidated his control of Iraq, Abu Bakr sent four armies to Syria on the Byzantine front under four different commanders: &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Ubaidah%20ibn%20al-Jarrah\"&gt;Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah&lt;/a&gt; (acting as their supreme commander), &lt;a href=\"Amr%20ibn%20al-As\"&gt;Amr ibn al-As&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yazid%20ibn%20Abu%20Sufyan\"&gt;Yazid ibn Abu Sufyan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shurhabil%20ibn%20Hasana\"&gt;Shurhabil ibn Hasana&lt;/a&gt;. However, their advance was halted by a concentration of the Byzantine army at Ajnadayn. Abu Ubaidah then sent for reinforcements. Abu Bakr ordered Khalid, who by now was planning to attack &lt;a href=\"Ctesiphon\"&gt;Ctesiphon&lt;/a&gt;, to march from Iraq to Syria with half his army. There were 2 major routes to Syria from Iraq, one passing through &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt; and the other through Daumat ul-Jandal. Khalid took an unconventional route through the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Desert\"&gt;Syrian Desert&lt;/a&gt;, and after a perilous march of 5 days, appeared in north-western Syria.\nThe border forts of &lt;a href=\"Sawa%2C%20Syria\"&gt;Sawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arak%2C%20Syria\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tadmur\"&gt;Tadmur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Al-Sukhnah%2C%20Syria\"&gt;Sukhnah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"al-Qaryatayn\"&gt;al-Qaryatayn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hawarin\"&gt;Hawarin&lt;/a&gt; were the first to fall to the invading Muslims. Khalid marched on to &lt;a href=\"Bosra\"&gt;Bosra&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Damascus\"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt; road. At Bosra, the Corps of Abu Ubaidah and Shurhabil joined Khalid, upon which, per Abu Bakr's orders, Khalid assumed overall command from Abu Ubaidah. Bosra, caught unprepared, surrendered after a brief siege in July 634 (see &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bosra\"&gt;Battle of Bosra&lt;/a&gt;), effectively ending the dynasty of the &lt;a href=\"Ghassanids\"&gt;Ghassanids&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom Bosra, Khalid sent orders to the other corps commanders to join him at Ajnadayn, where, according to early Muslim historians, a Byzantine army of 90,000 (modern sources state 9,000) was concentrated to push back the Muslims. The Byzantine army was defeated decisively on 30 July 634 in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ajnadayn\"&gt;Battle of Ajnadayn&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first major &lt;a href=\"pitched%20battle\"&gt;pitched battle&lt;/a&gt; between the Muslims and Byzantines and cleared the way for the former to capture central Syria. &lt;a href=\"Damascus\"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;, the Byzantine stronghold, was conquered shortly after on 19 September 634. The Byzantine army was given a deadline of 3 days to flee as far as they could, with their families and treasure, or simply agree to stay in Damascus and pay tribute. After the three days had passed, the Muslim cavalry, under Khalid's command, attacked the Roman army by catching up to them using an unknown shortcut at the &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Maraj-al-Debaj\"&gt;battle of Maraj-al-Debaj&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 22 August 634, Abu Bakr died, making Umar his successor. As Umar became caliph, he restored &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Ubaidah%20ibn%20al-Jarrah\"&gt;Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah&lt;/a&gt; to the overall command of the Muslim armies. The conquest of Syria slowed down under him while he relied heavily on the advice of Khalid, who he kept close at hand.\nThe last large garrison of the Byzantine army was at Fahl, which was joined by survivors of Ajnadayn. With this threat at their rear, the Muslim armies could not move further north nor south. Thus Abu Ubaidah decided to deal with the situation, and defeated and routed this garrison at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Fahl\"&gt;Battle of Fahl&lt;/a&gt; on 23 January 635, which proved to be the \"Key to Palestine\". After this battle Abu Ubaidah and Khalid marched north towards &lt;a href=\"Emesa\"&gt;Emesa&lt;/a&gt;; Yazid was stationed in Damascus while Amr and Shurhabil marched south to capture Palestine.\nWhile the Muslims were at Fahl, sensing the weak defense of Damascus, &lt;a href=\"Heraclius\"&gt;Emperor Heraclius&lt;/a&gt; sent an army to re-capture the city. This army, however, could not make it to Damascus and was intercepted by Abu Ubaidah and Khalid on their way to Emesa. The army was destroyed in the battle of Maraj-al-Rome and the second battle of Damascus. Emesa and the strategic town of &lt;a href=\"Chalcis\"&gt;Chalcis&lt;/a&gt; made peace with the Muslims for one year in order to buy time for Heraclius to prepare his defences and raise new armies. The Muslims welcomed the peace and consolidated their control over the conquered territory. However, as soon as the Muslims received the news of reinforcements being sent to Emesa and Chalcis, they marched against Emesa, laid &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Emesa\"&gt;siege to it&lt;/a&gt; and eventually captured the city in March 636.\nThe prisoners taken in the battle informed them about Emperor Heraclius's plans to take back Syria. They said that an army possibly 200,000 strong would soon emerge to recapture the province. Khalid stopped here on June 636. As soon as Abu Ubaida heard the news of the advancing Byzantine army, he gathered all his officers to plan their next move. Khalid suggested that they should consolidate all of their forces present in the province of Syria (Syria, Jordan, Palestine) and then move towards the plain of Yarmouk for battle.\nAbu Ubaida ordered the Muslim commanders to withdraw from all the conquered areas, return the tributes they had previously gathered, and move towards Yarmuk. Heraclius's army also moved towards Yarmuk, but the Muslim armies reached it in early July 636, a week or two before the Byzantines. Khalid's &lt;a href=\"mobile%20guard\"&gt;mobile guard&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Christian Arab auxiliaries of the Roman army in a &lt;a href=\"skirmish\"&gt;skirmish&lt;/a&gt;.\nNothing further happened until the third week of August, during which the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Yarmouk\"&gt;Battle of Yarmouk&lt;/a&gt; was fought. The battle lasted 6 days during which Abu Ubaida transferred the command of the entire army to Khalid. Outnumbered five-to-one, the Muslims nevertheless defeated the Byzantine army in October 636. Abu Ubaida held a meeting with his high command officers, including Khalid, to decide on future conquests, settling on &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. The siege of Jerusalem lasted four months, after which the city agreed to surrender, but only to Caliph Umar Ibn Al Khattab in person. Amr ibn Al As suggested that Khalid should be sent as Caliph, because of his very strong resemblance to Caliph Umar.\nKhalid was recognized and eventually, Caliph Umar ibn Al Khattab came and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%28637%29\"&gt;Jerusalem surrendered&lt;/a&gt; in April 637. Abu Ubaida sent Amr bin al-As, Yazid bin Abu Sufyan, and Sharjeel bin Hassana back to their areas to reconquer them; most submitted without a fight. Abu Ubaida himself, along with Khalid, moved to northern Syria to reconquer it with a 17,000-man army. Khalid, along with his cavalry, was sent to Hazir and Abu Ubaidah moved to the city of Qasreen.\nKhalid defeated a strong Byzantine army at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hazir\"&gt;Battle of Hazir&lt;/a&gt; and reached Qasreen before Abu Ubaidah. The city surrendered to Khalid, and soon after, Abu Ubaidah arrived in June 637. Abu Ubaidah then moved against &lt;a href=\"Aleppo\"&gt;Aleppo&lt;/a&gt;, with Khalid, as usual, commanding the cavalry. After the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Aleppo%20%28637%29\"&gt;Battle of Aleppo&lt;/a&gt; the city finally agreed to surrender in October 637.\nOccupation of Anatolia.\nAbu Ubaidah and Khalid ibn al-Walid, after conquering all of northern Syria, moved north towards &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolia&lt;/a&gt; taking the fort of &lt;a href=\"Azaz\"&gt;Azaz&lt;/a&gt; to clear the flank and rear of Byzantine troops. On their way to Antioch, a Roman army blocked them near a river on which there was an iron bridge. Because of this, the following battle is known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Iron%20Bridge\"&gt;Battle of the Iron Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. The Muslim army defeated the Byzantines and &lt;a href=\"Antioch\"&gt;Antioch&lt;/a&gt; surrendered on 30 October 637 CE. Later during the year, Abu Ubaidah sent Khalid and Iyad ibn Ghanm at the head of two separate armies against the western part of &lt;a href=\"Al-Jazira%2C%20Mesopotamia\"&gt;Jazira&lt;/a&gt;, most of which was conquered without strong resistance, including parts of Anatolia, &lt;a href=\"Edessa\"&gt;Edessa&lt;/a&gt; and the area up to the &lt;a href=\"Ararat%20plain\"&gt;Ararat plain&lt;/a&gt;. Other columns were sent to &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolia&lt;/a&gt; as far west as the &lt;a href=\"Taurus%20Mountains\"&gt;Taurus Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the important city of &lt;a href=\"Marash\"&gt;Marash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malatya\"&gt;Malatya&lt;/a&gt;, which were all conquered by Khalid in the autumn of 638 CE. During Uthman's reign, the Byzantines recaptured many &lt;a href=\"Fortification\"&gt;forts&lt;/a&gt; in the region and on Uthman's orders, a series of campaigns were launched to regain control of them. In 647 &lt;a href=\"Muawiyah%20I\"&gt;Muawiyah&lt;/a&gt;, the governor of Syria, sent an expedition against Anatolia, invading &lt;a href=\"Cappadocia\"&gt;Cappadocia&lt;/a&gt; and sacking &lt;a href=\"Caesarea%20Mazaca\"&gt;Caesarea Mazaca&lt;/a&gt;. In 648 the Rashidun army raided &lt;a href=\"Phrygia\"&gt;Phrygia&lt;/a&gt;. A major offensive into &lt;a href=\"Cilicia\"&gt;Cilicia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isauria\"&gt;Isauria&lt;/a&gt; in 650\u2013651 forced the Byzantine Emperor &lt;a href=\"Constans%20II\"&gt;Constans II&lt;/a&gt; to enter into negotiations with Muawiyah.\nThe truce that followed allowed a short respite and made it possible for Constans II to hold on to the western portions of &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;. In 654\u2013655, on the orders of Uthman, an expedition prepared to attack &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;, but this plan was not carried out due to the civil war that broke out in 656.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Taurus%20Mountains\"&gt;Taurus Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in Turkey marked the western frontiers of the Rashidun Caliphate in Anatolia during Caliph Uthman's reign.\nConquest of Egypt.\nIn 639, Egypt was a prefecture of the Byzantine Empire. However, it had been occupied just a decade before by the Sasanian Empire under &lt;a href=\"Khosrau%20II%20of%20Persia\"&gt;Khosrau II&lt;/a&gt; (616 to 629 &lt;a href=\"Common%20Era\"&gt;CE&lt;/a&gt;). The power of the Byzantine Empire was shattered during the Muslim conquest of Syria, and therefore the conquest of Egypt was much easier. In 639 some 4000 Rashidun troops led by &lt;a href=\"Amr%20ibn%20al-As\"&gt;Amr ibn al-As&lt;/a&gt; were sent by Umar to conquer the land of the ancient &lt;a href=\"pharaoh\"&gt;pharaoh&lt;/a&gt;s. The Rashidun army crossed into Egypt from Palestine in December 639 and advanced rapidly into the &lt;a href=\"Nile%20Delta\"&gt;Nile Delta&lt;/a&gt;. The imperial garrisons retreated into the walled towns, where they successfully held out for a year or more. However, the Muslims sent for reinforcements, and the invading army, joined by another 12,000 men in 640, defeated a Byzantine army at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Heliopolis\"&gt;Battle of Heliopolis&lt;/a&gt;. Amr next proceeded in the direction of &lt;a href=\"Alexandria\"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, which was surrendered to him by a treaty signed on 8 November 641. The &lt;a href=\"Thebaid\"&gt;Thebaid&lt;/a&gt; seems to have surrendered with scarcely any opposition.\nThe ease with which this valuable province was wrenched from the Byzantine Empire appears to have been due to the treachery of &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;, prefect of Egypt and &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Orthodox%20Patriarch%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;Patriarch of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, and the incompetence of the Byzantine generals, as well as the loss of most of the Byzantine troops in Syria. Cyrus had persecuted the local &lt;a href=\"Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;Coptic Christians&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the authors of &lt;a href=\"monothelism\"&gt;monothelism&lt;/a&gt;, a seventh-century heresy, and some supposed him to have been a secret convert to Islam.\nIn 645, during Uthman's reign, the Byzantines briefly regained Alexandria, but it was retaken by Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by &lt;a href=\"Constans%20II%20%28Byzantine%20Empire%29\"&gt;Constans II&lt;/a&gt; was repulsed. After this, no serious effort was made by the Byzantines to regain possession of the country.\nThe Muslims were assisted by some Copts, who found the Muslims more tolerant than the Byzantines, and of these, some turned to Islam. In return for a tribute of money and food for the occupation troops, the Christian inhabitants of Egypt were excused from military service and left free in the observance of their religion and the administration of their affairs. Others sided with the Byzantines, hoping that they would provide a defense against the Arab invaders. During the reign of &lt;a href=\"Ali\"&gt;Caliph Ali&lt;/a&gt;, Egypt was captured by rebel troops under the command of former Rashidun army general &lt;a href=\"Amr%20ibn%20al-As\"&gt;Amr ibn al-As&lt;/a&gt;, who killed &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20ibn%20Abi%20Bakr\"&gt;Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr&lt;/a&gt;, the governor of Egypt appointed by &lt;a href=\"Ali\"&gt;Ali&lt;/a&gt;.\nConquest of North Africa.\nAfter the withdrawal of the Byzantines from Egypt, the &lt;a href=\"Exarchate%20of%20Africa\"&gt;Exarchate of Africa&lt;/a&gt; declared its independence. Under its exarch, &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20the%20Patrician\"&gt;Gregory the Patrician&lt;/a&gt;, its dominions extended from the borders of Egypt to &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Abdullah%20ibn%20Sa%27ad\"&gt;Abdullah ibn Sa'ad&lt;/a&gt; sent raiding parties to the west, resulting in considerable booty and encouraging Sa'ad to propose a campaign to conquer the Exarchate.\nUthman gave him permission after considering it in the Majlis al-Shura. A force of 10,000 soldiers was sent as reinforcement. The Rashidun army assembled in &lt;a href=\"Barqa\"&gt;Barqa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrenaica\"&gt;Cyrenaica&lt;/a&gt;, and from there they marched west, captured &lt;a href=\"Tripoli\"&gt;Tripoli&lt;/a&gt;, and then advanced to &lt;a href=\"Sbeitla\"&gt;Sufetula&lt;/a&gt;, Gregory's capital. In the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sufetula%20%28647%29\"&gt;ensuing battle&lt;/a&gt;, the Exarchate was defeated and Gregory was killed due to the superior tactics of &lt;a href=\"Abdullah%20ibn%20Zubayr\"&gt;Abdullah ibn Zubayr&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, the people of &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt; sued for peace, agreeing to pay an annual tribute. Instead of annexing &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt;, the Muslims preferred to make North Africa a &lt;a href=\"vassal%20state\"&gt;vassal state&lt;/a&gt;. When the stipulated amount of the tribute was paid, the Muslim forces withdrew to Barqa. Following the &lt;a href=\"First%20Fitna\"&gt;First Fitna&lt;/a&gt;, the first Islamic civil war, Muslim forces withdrew from north Africa to Egypt. The &lt;a href=\"Umayyad%20Caliphate\"&gt;Umayyad Caliphate&lt;/a&gt; would later re-invade North Africa in 664.\nCampaign against Nubia (Sudan).\nA campaign was undertaken against &lt;a href=\"Nubia\"&gt;Nubia&lt;/a&gt; during the Caliphate of Umar in 642, but failed after the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Makuria\"&gt;Makurians&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"First%20Battle%20of%20Dongola\"&gt;First Battle of Dongola&lt;/a&gt;. The Muslim army pulled out of Nubia with nothing to show for it. Ten years later, Uthman's governor of Egypt, Abdullah ibn Saad, sent another army to Nubia. This army penetrated deeper into Nubia and laid siege to the Nubian capital of &lt;a href=\"Dongola\"&gt;Dongola&lt;/a&gt;. The Muslims damaged the &lt;a href=\"cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the city, but Makuria also won this &lt;a href=\"Second%20Battle%20of%20Dongola\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt;. As the Muslims were unable to overpower Makuria, they negotiated a mutual non-aggression treaty with their king, Qaladurut. Each side also agreed to afford free passage to each other through their respective territories. Nubia agreed to provide 360 slaves to Egypt every year, while Egypt agreed to supply grain, horses, and textiles to Nubia according to demand.\nConquest of the islands of the Mediterranean Sea.\nDuring Umar's reign, the governor of Syria, &lt;a href=\"Muawiyah%20I\"&gt;Muawiyah I&lt;/a&gt;, sent a request to build a naval force to invade the islands of the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt; but Umar rejected the proposal because of the risk to the soldiers. Once Uthman became caliph, however, he approved Muawiyah's request. In 650, Muawiyah attacked &lt;a href=\"Cyprus\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, conquering the capital, &lt;a href=\"Salamis%2C%20Cyprus\"&gt;Constantia&lt;/a&gt;, after a brief siege, but signed a treaty with the local rulers. During this expedition, a relative of Muhammad, Umm-Haram, fell from her mule near the &lt;a href=\"Larnaca%20Salt%20Lake\"&gt;Salt Lake&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Larnaca\"&gt;Larnaca&lt;/a&gt; and was killed. She was buried in that same spot, which became a holy site for many local Muslims and Christians and, in 1816, the &lt;a href=\"Hala%20Sultan%20Tekke\"&gt;Hala Sultan Tekke&lt;/a&gt; was built there by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottomans&lt;/a&gt;. After apprehending a breach of the treaty, the Arabs re-invaded the island in 654 with five hundred ships. This time, however, a garrison of 12,000 men was left in Cyprus, bringing the island under Muslim influence. After leaving Cyprus, the Muslim fleet headed towards &lt;a href=\"Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Rhodes\"&gt;Rhodes&lt;/a&gt; and conquered them without much resistance. From 652 to 654, the Muslims launched a naval campaign against &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt; and captured a large part of the island. Soon after this, Uthman was murdered, ending his expansionist policy, and the Muslims accordingly retreated from Sicily. In 655 Byzantine Emperor &lt;a href=\"Constans%20II%20%28Byzantine%20Empire%29\"&gt;Constans II&lt;/a&gt; led a fleet in person to attack the Muslims at &lt;a href=\"Finike\"&gt;Phoinike&lt;/a&gt; (off &lt;a href=\"Lycia\"&gt;Lycia&lt;/a&gt;) but it was defeated: both sides suffered heavy losses in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Masts\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt;, and the emperor himself narrowly avoided death.\nTreatment of conquered peoples.\nThe non-Muslim monotheists\u2014Jews, &lt;a href=\"Zoroastrianism\"&gt;Zoroastrians&lt;/a&gt;, and Christians\u2014in conquered lands were called \"dhimmis\" (the protected people). Those who accepted Islam were treated in a similar manner to other Muslims and were given equivalent rights in legal matters. Non-Muslims were given legal rights according to their faiths' law except where it conflicted with Islamic law.\n\"Dhimmis\" were allowed to \"practice their religion, and to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy\" and were guaranteed their personal safety and security of property, but only in return for paying tax and acknowledging Muslim rule. \"Dhimmis\" were also required to pay the \"&lt;a href=\"jizya\"&gt;jizya&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Rashidun caliphs had placed special emphasis on relatively fair and just treatment of the \"dhimmis\", which were also provided 'protection' by the Caliphate and were not expected to fight. Sometimes, particularly when there were not enough qualified Muslims, \"dhimmis\" were given important positions in the government.\nHistoriography and Reception.\nSome secular scholars have questioned the traditional &lt;a href=\"Sunni\"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; view of the Rashidun. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20G.%20Hoyland\"&gt;Robert G. Hoyland&lt;/a&gt; states that \"writers who lived at the same time as the first four caliphs ... recorded next to nothing about them, and their names do not appear on coins, inscriptions, or documents. It is only with the fifth caliph\", &lt;a href=\"Muawiyah%20I\"&gt;Muawiyah I&lt;/a&gt;(661\u2013680), \"that was have evidence of a functioning Arab government, since his name appears on all official state media.\" However there do exist inscriptions dating to the period, one of which for instance mentions &lt;a href=\"Umar\"&gt;Umar&lt;/a&gt; by name and the date of his death, and there were also coins struck during his rule (although as Hoyland notes, they do not bear his name, simply \"In the name of God,\")\nHoyland also questions the alleged moral superiority of the Rashidun (or at least of Uthman and Ali) to their Umayyad successors, noting Ali was involved in the first civil war (&lt;a href=\"First%20Fitna\"&gt;First Fitna&lt;/a&gt;) and Uthman had \"already inaugurated a nepotistic style of government\", for which later Caliphs were condemned, and wonders if the idea of a divinely guided \"golden age\" of early Islam came from a need by late Umayyad and Abassid religious scholars to differentiate the first caliphs (who had more power in law making) and the contemporary Caliphs who they wanted to defer to them (the ulama) in religious matters. Consequently, the companions were \"given a makeover\" as \"model's of piety and beyond reproach\".\nThis is in-line with &lt;a href=\"Shia%20Islam\"&gt;Shi'ite views&lt;/a&gt; of the companions, including the Rashidun Caliphs. Many of the Shi'a do not share the Sunni view that the companions were all models of piety, instead accusing many them of conspiring after the Prophet's death to dispossess &lt;a href=\"Ali%20ibn%20Abi%20Talib\"&gt;Ali ibn Abi Talib&lt;/a&gt; and his descendants of the divinely ordained right to leadership. In this Shi'ite perspective, many of the companions and their successors were usurpers, even hypocrites, who never ceased to subvert the religion for their own interests.\nThe stark differences in these two views has led to sectarian tension that has even culminated in violence.\nPolitical administration.\nThe basic administrative system of the Dar al-Islamiyyah (The House of Islam) was laid down in the days of Muhammad. Caliph Abu Bakr stated in his sermon when he was elected: \"If I order any thing that would go against the order of Allah and his Messenger; then do not obey me\". This is considered to be the foundation stone of the Caliphate.\nCaliph Umar has been reported to have said: \"O Muslims, straighten me with your hands when I go wrong\", and at that instance, a Muslim man stood up and said, \"O Amir al-Mu'minin (Leader of the Believers) if you are not straightened by our hands we will use our sword to straighten you!\". Hearing this Caliph Umar said \"Alhamdulillah (Praise be to Allah) I have such followers.\"\nDistricts or provinces.\nUnder Abu Bakr, the empire was not clearly divided into provinces, though it had many administrative districts.\nUnder Umar the Empire was divided into a number of &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;s which were as follows:\nIn his &lt;a href=\"Will%20%28law%29\"&gt;testament&lt;/a&gt; Umar had instructed his successor, Uthman, not to make any change in the administrative setup for one year after his death, which Uthman honored; however, after the expiration of the moratorium, he made Egypt one province and created a new province comprising &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt;. He also consolidated Syria, previously divided into two provinces, into one.\nDuring Uthman's reign the caliphate was divided into twelve provinces. These were:\nDuring Ali's reign, with the exception of Syria (which was under &lt;a href=\"Muawiyah%20I\"&gt;Muawiyah I&lt;/a&gt;'s control) and Egypt (lost during the latter years of his caliphate to the rebel troops of &lt;a href=\"%27Amr%20ibn%20al-%27As\"&gt;Amr ibn Al-A'as&lt;/a&gt;), the remaining ten provinces were under his control, with no change in administrative organization.\nThe provinces were further divided into &lt;a href=\"district\"&gt;district&lt;/a&gt;s. Each of the 100 or more districts of the empire, along with the main cities, were administered by a &lt;a href=\"governor\"&gt;governor&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"W%C4%81li\"&gt;W\u0101li&lt;/a&gt;\"). Other officers at the provincial level were:\nIn some districts there were separate military officers, though the governor was in most cases the &lt;a href=\"commander-in-chief\"&gt;commander-in-chief&lt;/a&gt; of the army quartered in the province.\nThe officers were appointed by the Caliph. Every appointment was made in writing. At the time of appointment, an instrument of instructions was issued to regulate the conduct of the governors. On assuming office, the Governor was required to assemble the people in the main &lt;a href=\"mosque\"&gt;mosque&lt;/a&gt;, and read the instrument of instructions before them.\nUmar's general instructions to his officers were:\nDuring the reign of Abu Bakr the state was economically weak, while during Umar's reign because of an increase in revenues and other sources of income, the state was on its way to economic prosperity. Hence Umar felt it necessary to treat the officers strictly, in order to prevent corruption. During his reign, at the time of appointment, every officer was required to swear an oath:\nCaliph Umar himself followed the above postulates strictly. During the reign of &lt;a href=\"Uthman%20ibn%20Affan\"&gt;Uthman&lt;/a&gt; the state became more economically prosperous than ever before; the allowance of the citizens was increased by 25%, and the economic condition of the ordinary person was more stable, which led Caliph Uthman to revoke the 2nd and 3rd postulates of the oath.\nAt the time of an officer's appointment, a complete inventory of all his possessions was prepared and kept on record. If there was later an unusual increase in his possessions, he was immediately called to account, and the unlawful property confiscated by the State. The principal officers were required to come to Mecca on the occasion of the &lt;a href=\"Hajj\"&gt;Hajj&lt;/a&gt;, during which people were free to present any complaint against them. In order to minimize the chances of corruption, Umar made it a point to pay high salaries to the staff. Provincial governors received as much as five to seven thousand &lt;a href=\"dirham\"&gt;dirham&lt;/a&gt;s annually besides their share of the spoils of war (if they were also the commander-in-chief of the army of their sector).\nJudicial administration.\nThe judicial administration, like the rest of the administrative structure of the Rashidun Caliphate, was set up by Umar, and it remained basically unchanged throughout the duration of the Caliphate. In order to provide adequate and speedy justice for the people, justice was administered according to the &lt;a href=\"Shariah\"&gt;principles of Islam&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccordingly, \"&lt;a href=\"Qadi\"&gt;Qadi&lt;/a&gt;s\" (judges) were appointed at all administrative levels. The \"Qadis\" were chosen for their integrity and learning in Islamic law. Wealthy men and men of high social status, compensated highly by the Caliphate, were appointed in order to make them resistant to bribery or undue influence based on social position. The \"Qadis\" also were not allowed to engage in trade. Judges were appointed in sufficient numbers to staff every district with at least one.\nElecting or appointing a caliph.\nThe four &lt;a href=\"Rashidun\"&gt;Rashidun&lt;/a&gt; caliphs were chosen by a small electoral body consisting of prominent members of the &lt;a href=\"Quraysh\"&gt;Quraysh&lt;/a&gt; called (, ).\n&lt;a href=\"Fred%20Donner\"&gt;Fred Donner&lt;/a&gt;, in his book \"The Early Islamic Conquests\" (1981), argues that the standard Arabian practice during the early Caliphates was for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader's death and elect a leader from amongst themselves, although there was no specified procedure for this &lt;a href=\"shura\"&gt;shura&lt;/a&gt;, or consultative assembly. Candidates were usually from the same lineage as the deceased leader, but they were not necessarily his sons. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual direct heir, as there was no basis in the majority Sunni view that the head of state or governor should be chosen based on lineage alone.\nThis argument is advanced by Sunni Muslims that Muhammad's companion Abu Bakr was elected by the community, and this was the proper procedure. They further argue that a caliph is ideally chosen by election or community consensus. The caliphate became a hereditary office or the prize of the strongest general after the Rashidun caliphate. However, Sunni Muslims believe this was after the 'rightly guided' Rashidun caliphate ended.\n&lt;a href=\"Al-Baqillani\"&gt;Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani&lt;/a&gt; has said that the leader of the Muslims should simply be from the majority. &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Hanifa%20an-Nu%E2%80%98man\"&gt;Abu Hanifa an-Nu\u2018man&lt;/a&gt; also wrote that the leader must come from the majority.\nSunni belief.\nFollowing the death of Muhammad, a meeting took place at &lt;a href=\"Saqifah\"&gt;Saqifah&lt;/a&gt;. At that meeting, Abu Bakr was elected caliph by the Muslim community. Sunni Muslims developed the belief that the caliph is a temporal political ruler, appointed to rule within the bounds of Islamic law (\"viz.\", the rules of life set by Allah in the Qur'an). The job of adjudicating orthodoxy and Islamic law was left to &lt;a href=\"Ijtihad\"&gt;Islamic lawyers&lt;/a&gt;, judiciary, or specialists individually termed as &lt;a href=\"Mujtahid\"&gt;Mujtahid&lt;/a&gt;s and collectively named the &lt;a href=\"Ulema\"&gt;Ulema&lt;/a&gt;. The first four caliphs are called the Rashidun, meaning the Rightly Guided Caliphs, because they are believed to have followed the Qur'an and the &lt;a href=\"sunnah\"&gt;sunnah&lt;/a&gt; (example) of Muhammad in all things.\nAccountability of rulers.\nSunni Islamic lawyers have commented on when it is permissible to disobey, &lt;a href=\"Impeachment\"&gt;impeach&lt;/a&gt; or remove rulers in the Caliphate. This is usually when the rulers are not meeting public responsibilities obliged upon them under Islam.\nAl-Mawardi said that if the rulers meet their Islamic responsibilities to the public, the people must obey their laws, but if they become either unjust or severely ineffective then the Caliph or ruler must be impeached via the Majlis al-Shura. &lt;a href=\"Al-Juwayni\"&gt;Al-Juwayni&lt;/a&gt; argued that Islam is the goal of the ummah, so any ruler that deviates from this goal must be impeached. Al-Ghazali believed that &lt;a href=\"oppression\"&gt;oppression&lt;/a&gt; by a caliph is enough for impeachment. Rather than just relying on impeachment, &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20Hajar%20al-Asqalani\"&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani&lt;/a&gt; obliged &lt;a href=\"rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; upon the people if the caliph began to act with no regard for Islamic law. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said that to ignore such a situation is \"&lt;a href=\"haraam\"&gt;haraam&lt;/a&gt;\", and those who cannot revolt inside the caliphate should launch a struggle from outside. Al-Asqalani used two &lt;a href=\"ayah\"&gt;ayah&lt;/a&gt;s from the Qur'an to justify this:\nIslamic lawyers have commented that when the rulers refuse to step down via successful impeachment through the Majlis, becoming dictators through the support of a corrupt army, the majority, upon agreement, has the option to launch a &lt;a href=\"revolution\"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt; against them. Many noted that this option is only exercised after factoring in the potential cost of life.\nRule of law.\nThe following &lt;a href=\"hadith\"&gt;hadith&lt;/a&gt; establishes the principle of &lt;a href=\"rule%20of%20law\"&gt;rule of law&lt;/a&gt; in relation to &lt;a href=\"nepotism\"&gt;nepotism&lt;/a&gt; and accountability:\nVarious Islamic lawyers do, however, place multiple conditions, and stipulations\u2014e.g., the poor cannot be penalised for stealing out of poverty\u2014before executing such a law, making it very difficult to reach such a stage. It is well known that, during a time of drought during the Rashidun caliphate, &lt;a href=\"capital%20punishment\"&gt;capital punishment&lt;/a&gt;s were suspended until the effects of the drought passed.\n&lt;a href=\"Ulema\"&gt;Islamic jurists&lt;/a&gt; later formulated the concept of the rule of law, the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land. A &lt;a href=\"Qadi\"&gt;Qadi&lt;/a&gt; (Islamic judge) was also not allowed to discriminate on the grounds of religion, gender, &lt;a href=\"Human%20skin%20color\"&gt;colour&lt;/a&gt;, kinship or prejudice. There were also a number of cases where caliphs had to appear before judges as they prepared to deliver their verdict.\nAccording to Noah Feldman, a law professor at &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;, the legal scholars and jurists who once upheld the &lt;a href=\"rule%20of%20law\"&gt;rule of law&lt;/a&gt; were replaced by a law governed by the state due to the &lt;a href=\"Codification%20%28law%29\"&gt;codification&lt;/a&gt; of Sharia by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the early 19th century.\nEconomy.\nBait-ul-Maal.\n\"Bait-ul-Maal\" (lit., \"the house of money\") was the department that dealt with the revenues and all other economic matters of the state. In the time of Muhammad, there was no permanent Bait-ul-Mal or public &lt;a href=\"treasury\"&gt;treasury&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever revenues or other amounts were received were distributed immediately. There were no salaries to be paid, and there was no state expenditure, thereby making a public treasury unnecessary.\n&lt;a href=\"Abu%20Bakr\"&gt;Abu Bakr&lt;/a&gt; (632\u2013634) established a house where all money was kept on receipt. As all money was distributed immediately, the treasury generally remained locked up; at the time of Abu Bakr's death, there was only one dirham in the public treasury.\nEstablishment of Bait-ul-Maal.\nIn the time of Umar, things changed. With each conquest, revenue increased. Umar also granted salaries to the army. &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Huraira\"&gt;Abu Huraira&lt;/a&gt;, the Governor of &lt;a href=\"Bahrain\"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, sent his revenue to Umar, amounting to five hundred thousand dirhams. Umar summoned a meeting of his Consultative Assembly and sought the opinion of the Companions about the disposal of the money. &lt;a href=\"Uthman%20ibn%20Affan\"&gt;Uthman ibn Affan&lt;/a&gt; advised that the amount should be kept for future needs. Walid bin Hisham suggested that, like the Byzantines, separate departments of treasury and accounts should be set up.\nAfter consulting the Companions, Umar decided to establish the central Treasury at Medina. Abdullah bin Arqam was appointed as the Treasury Officer. He was assisted by &lt;a href=\"Abdur%20Rahman%20bin%20Awf\"&gt;Abdur Rahman bin Awf&lt;/a&gt; and Muiqib. A separate Accounts Department was also set up to maintain spending records.\nLater treasuries were set up in the provinces. After meeting the local expenditure the provincial treasuries were required to remit the surplus revenue to the central treasury at Medina. According to Yaqubi the salaries and stipends charged to the central treasury amounted to over 30\u00a0million dirhams.\nA separate building was constructed for the royal treasury, the \"bait ul maal\", which, in large cities, was protected by as many as 400 guards.\nMost historical accounts state that, among the Rashidun caliphs, Uthman was the first to strike coins; some accounts, however, state that Umar was the first to do so. When Persia was conquered, three types of coins were current there: the Baghli, of eight dang; Tabari of four dang; and Maghribi of three dang. Umar (or Uthman, according to some accounts) first struck an Islamic dirham of six dang.\n&lt;a href=\"Welfare%20%28financial%20aid%29\"&gt;Social welfare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pension\"&gt;pension&lt;/a&gt;s were introduced in early &lt;a href=\"Sharia\"&gt;Islamic law&lt;/a&gt; as forms of \"zak\u0101t\" (charity), one of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Pillars%20of%20Islam\"&gt;Five Pillars of Islam&lt;/a&gt;, since the time of Umar. The &lt;a href=\"tax\"&gt;tax&lt;/a&gt;es (including \"zak\u0101t\" and \"jizya\") collected in the &lt;a href=\"treasury\"&gt;treasury&lt;/a&gt; of an Islamic &lt;a href=\"government\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; were used to provide income for the needy, including the poor, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist &lt;a href=\"Al-Ghazali\"&gt;Al-Ghazali&lt;/a&gt; (Algazel, 1058\u20131111), the government was also expected to stockpile food supplies in every region in case a &lt;a href=\"disaster\"&gt;disaster&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"famine\"&gt;famine&lt;/a&gt; occurred. The Caliphate was thus one of the earliest &lt;a href=\"welfare%20state\"&gt;welfare state&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEconomic resources of the State.\nThe economic resources of the State were:\nZakat.\n\"Zak\u0101t\" () is the Islamic equivalent of a luxury tax. It was taken from the Muslims in the amount of 2.5% of their dormant wealth (\"viz.\", that over a certain amount unused for a year) to give to the poor. All and only those persons whose annual wealth exceeded a minimum level (&lt;a href=\"nisab\"&gt;nisab&lt;/a&gt;) were collected from. The \"nisab\" did not include one's primary residence, primary transportation, a moderate amount of woven jewelry, etc. \"Zak\u0101t\" is one of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Pillars%20of%20Islam\"&gt;Five Pillars of Islam&lt;/a&gt;.\nJizya.\n\"Jizya\" or \"jizyah\" (; &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Turkish%20language\"&gt;Ottoman Turkish&lt;/a&gt;: cizye). It was a &lt;a href=\"per%20capita\"&gt;per capita&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tax\"&gt;tax&lt;/a&gt; imposed on able bodied non-Muslim men of military age since non-Muslims did not have to pay zak\u0101t. Slaves, women, children, monks, the old, the sick, hermits and the poor were all exempt. It is important to note that, in addition to the exemptions, some needy non-Muslims were given stipends by the state.\nFay.\n\"Fay\" was the income from State land, whether an agricultural land or a meadow or land with any natural &lt;a href=\"mineral\"&gt;mineral&lt;/a&gt; reserves.\nKhums.\n\"Ghanimah\" or \"Khums\" represented war booty, four-fifths of which was distributed among serving soldiers, while one-fifth was allotted to the state.\nKharaj.\n\"Kharaj\" was a tax on agricultural land.\nInitially, after the first Muslim conquests in the 7th century, \"kharaj\" usually denoted a lump-sum duty levied upon the conquered provinces and collected by the officials of the former Byzantine and Sasanian empires, or, more broadly, any kind of tax levied by Muslim conquerors on their non-Muslim subjects, &lt;a href=\"dhimmi\"&gt;dhimmi&lt;/a&gt;s. At that time, \"kharaj\" was synonymous with \"jizyah\", which later emerged as a &lt;a href=\"Tax%20per%20head\"&gt;poll tax&lt;/a&gt; paid by dhimmis. Muslim landowners, on the other hand, paid only ushr, a religious &lt;a href=\"tithe\"&gt;tithe&lt;/a&gt;, which carried a much lower rate of taxation.\nUshr.\n\"Ushr\" was a reciprocal 10% levy on agricultural land as well as merchandise imported from states that taxed the Muslims on their products. Umar was the first Muslim ruler to levy \"ushr\". Umar issued instructions that \"ushr\" should be levied in such a way so as to avoid hardship, so as not to affect trade within the Caliphate. The tax was levied only on merchandise meant for sale; goods imported for consumption or personal use but not for sale were not taxed. Merchandise valued at 200 dirhams or less was not taxed. Imports by citizens for trade purposes were subject to the customs duty or import tax at lower rates. In the case of the \"dhimmis\", the rate was 5% and, in the case of the Muslims, 2.5%, the same as that of \"zak\u0101t\". The levy was thus regarded as a part of \"zak\u0101t\" rather than a separate tax.\nAllowance.\nBeginning of the allowance.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Yarmouk\"&gt;Battle of Yarmouk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20al-Qadisiyyah\"&gt;Battle of al-Qadisiyyah&lt;/a&gt; the Muslims won heavy spoils, filling the coffers at Medina. The problem before Umar was what to do with this money. Someone suggested that the money should be kept in the treasury as a reserve for public expenditures. However, this view was not acceptable to the general body of Muslims. Accordingly, a consensus was reached to distribute whatever was received during a year to the citizens.\nThe next question was what system should be adopted for distribution. One suggestion was to distribute it equally on an ad hoc basis. Others objected that, as the spoils were considerable, the proposal would make the people very rich. It was therefore agreed that, instead of ad hoc division, the amount of the allowance to the stipend should be determined beforehand and this allowance should be paid regardless of the amount of the spoils.\nOn the amount of the &lt;a href=\"allowance%20%28money%29\"&gt;allowance&lt;/a&gt; there were two opinions. Some held that it should be the same for all Muslims. Umar, on the other hand, believed that the allowance should be graduated according to one's merit with reference to Islam.\nThen the question arose as to what basis should be used for placing some above others. Some suggested that the Caliph should first get the highest allowance, with the remaining allowances graduating downward from that. Umar rejected the proposal and decided to start with the clan of Muhammad.\nUmar set up a committee to compile a list of persons by nearness to Muhammad. The committee produced the list clan-wise. Bani Hashim appeared as the first clan, then the clan of Abu Bakr, and then the clan of Umar. Umar accepted the first two placements but relegated his clan lower on the relationship scale.\nThe main provisions of the final scale of allowance approved by Umar were:\nUnder this scale, Umar's son &lt;a href=\"Abdullah%20ibn%20Umar\"&gt;Abdullah ibn Umar&lt;/a&gt; got an allowance of 3000 dirhams, while &lt;a href=\"Usama%20ibn%20Zaid\"&gt;Usama ibn Zaid&lt;/a&gt; got 4000. The ordinary Muslim citizens got allowances of between 2000 and 2500. The regular annual allowance was given only to the urban population because they formed the backbone of the state's economic resources. The Bedouin living in the desert, cut off from the state's affairs, and making no contributions to development, were nevertheless often given stipends. On assuming office, Uthman increased these stipends by 25%.\nEvaluation.\nThe evaluation greatly contributed to the prosperity of the citizens as trade increased, and their contributions to the \"bait al maal\" increased accordingly.\nPublic works.\nThe mosques were not merely places for offering prayers, but also community centers where the faithful gathered to discuss problems of social and cultural importance. During the caliphate of Umar, as many as four thousand mosques were constructed extending from Persia in the east to Egypt in the west. Al-&lt;a href=\"Masjid%20an-Nabawi\"&gt;Masjid an-Nabawi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Masjid%20al-Haram\"&gt;Masjid al-Haram&lt;/a&gt; were enlarged first during the reign of Umar and then during the reign of Uthman ibn Affan, who not only expanded them but also beautified them on a large scale.\nDuring the caliphate of Umar, many new cities were founded. These included &lt;a href=\"Kufa\"&gt;Kufa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Basra\"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fustat\"&gt;Fustat&lt;/a&gt;. These cities were laid out according to the principles of urban planning. All streets in these cities led to the &lt;a href=\"Friday%20mosque\"&gt;Friday mosque&lt;/a&gt;, which was sited in the center of the city. Markets were established at convenient points, which were overseen by market officers charged with ensuring the quality of goods. The cities were divided into quarters, and each quarter was reserved for particular tribes. During the reign of Umar, there were restrictions on the construction of palatial buildings by the rich and elites\u2014symbolic of the egalitarian society of Islam, where all were equal\u2014although the restrictions were later revoked by Uthman because of the rise in the overall standard of living, and the construction of two-story buildings were permitted. As a result, many palatial buildings were constructed throughout the empire, including Uthman's huge palace in Medina, \"Al-Zawar\", constructed from his personal resources.\nMany buildings were built for administrative purposes. In the \"Dar-ul-Amarat\" quarters, government offices and residences for officers were sited. Diwans were constructed to house official records. Bait-ul-Mal was used to house royal treasuries. &lt;a href=\"Jail\"&gt;Jail&lt;/a&gt;s were constructed for the first time in &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20history\"&gt;Muslim history&lt;/a&gt;. In important cities, guest houses were constructed to serve traders and merchants coming from faraway places. Roads and bridges were constructed for public use. On the road from Medina to Mecca, shelters, wells, and meal houses were constructed at every stage for the convenience of the people who came for hajj.\nMilitary cantonments were constructed at strategic points. Special stables were provided for cavalry, which could accommodate as many as 4,000 horses. Special pasture grounds were provided and maintained for \"Bait-ul-Mal\" animals.\n&lt;a href=\"Canal\"&gt;Canal&lt;/a&gt;s were dug to irrigate fields as well as provide drinking water. The Abu Musa canal, named for the &lt;a href=\"Abu-Musa%20al-Asha%27ari\"&gt;governor of Basra&lt;/a&gt;, was a nine-mile (14\u00a0km) long canal which brought water from the Tigris to Basra. The Maqal canal was also dug from the Tigris. The Amir al-Mu'minin canal, named for a &lt;a href=\"Amir%20al-Mu%27minin\"&gt;title created by Umar&lt;/a&gt;, was dug to join the &lt;a href=\"Nile\"&gt;Nile&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sea\"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt;. During the famine of 639, grain was brought from Egypt to Arabia through this canal, which saved the lives of millions. The Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas canal, named for the &lt;a href=\"Sa%60d%20ibn%20Abi%20Waqqas\"&gt;governor of Kufa&lt;/a&gt;, brought water to Anbar from the Euphrates. &lt;a href=\"%27Amr%20ibn%20al-%27As\"&gt;'Amr ibn al-'As&lt;/a&gt;, the governor of Egypt during the reign of Umar, even proposed the digging of a canal to join the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sea\"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt;. This proposal, however, did not materialize due to unknown reasons, and it was 1200 years later that such a canal was dug\u2014the modern &lt;a href=\"Suez%20Canal\"&gt;Suez Canal&lt;/a&gt;. Shuaibia was the port for Mecca, but it was inconvenient, so Uthman had a new seaport built at &lt;a href=\"Jeddah\"&gt;Jeddah&lt;/a&gt;. Uthman also reformed the city's police departments.\nMilitary.\nThe Rashidun Military was the primary arm of the Islamic armed forces of the 7th century, serving alongside the Rashidun navy. The army maintained a very high level of discipline, strategic prowess, and organization, along with the motivation and initiative of the officer corps. For much of its history, this army was one of the most powerful and effective military forces throughout the region. At the height of the Rashidun Caliphate, the maximum size of the army was around 100,000 troops.\nRashidun army.\nThe Rashidun army was divided into &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"light%20cavalry\"&gt;light cavalry&lt;/a&gt;. Reconstructing the military equipment of early Muslim armies is problematic. Compared with Roman armies or later medieval Muslim armies, the range of visual representation is very small, often imprecise. Physically, very little material evidence has survived, and much of it is difficult to date. The soldiers wore iron and bronze segmented helmets from Iraq, of Central Asian type.\nThe standard form of body armor was &lt;a href=\"chainmail\"&gt;chainmail&lt;/a&gt;. There are also references to the practice of wearing two coats of mail (\"dir\u2019ayn\"), the one under the main one being shorter or even made of fabric or leather. &lt;a href=\"Hauberk\"&gt;Hauberk&lt;/a&gt;s and large wooden or &lt;a href=\"wickerwork\"&gt;wickerwork&lt;/a&gt; shields were also used as protection in combat. The soldiers were usually equipped with swords hung in a &lt;a href=\"baldric\"&gt;baldric&lt;/a&gt;. They also possessed spears and daggers. Umar was the first Muslim ruler to organize the army as a state department, in 637. A beginning was made with the Quraish and the &lt;a href=\"Ansar%20%28Islam%29\"&gt;Ansar&lt;/a&gt; and the system was gradually extended to the whole of Arabia and to Muslims of conquered lands.\nThe basic strategy of early Muslim armies on the campaign was to exploit every possible weakness of the enemy. Their key strength was mobility. The cavalry had both horses and camels, the latter used as both transport and food for long marches through the desert (\"e.g.\", Khalid ibn al-Walid's extraordinary march from the Persian border to Damascus). The cavalry was the army's main strike force and also served as a strategic mobile reserve. The common tactic was to use the infantry and archers to engage and maintain contact with the enemy while the cavalry was held back till the enemy was fully engaged. Once fully engaged, the enemy reserves were held by the infantry and archers, while the cavalry executed a pincer movement (like modern tank and mechanized divisions) to attack the enemy from the sides or to assault their base camps.\nThe Rashidun army was, in quality and strength, below the standard set by the Sasanian and Byzantine armies. Khalid ibn al-Walid was the first general of the Rashidun Caliphate to successfully conquer foreign lands. During his campaign against the Sasanian Empire (Iraq, 633\u2013634) and the Byzantine Empire (Syria, 634\u2013638), Khalid developed brilliant tactics that he used effectively against both enemy armies.\nAbu Bakr's strategy was to give his generals their mission, the geographical area in which that mission would be carried out, and resources for that purpose. He would then leave it to his generals to accomplish their missions in whatever manner they chose. On the other hand, Umar, in the latter part of his Caliphate, adopted a more hands-on approach, directing his generals where to stay and when to move to the next target and who was to command the left and right-wing of the army in each particular battle. This made conquests comparatively slower but made the campaigns well-organized. Uthman and Ali reverted to Abu Bakr's method, giving missions to their generals and leaving the details to them.\nRashidun navy.\nThe early caliphate naval conquest managed to mark long time legacy of Islamic maritime enterprises from the Conquest of &lt;a href=\"Cyprus\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, the famous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Masts\"&gt;Battle of the Masts&lt;/a&gt; up to of their successor states such as the area Transoxiana from area located in between the Jihun River(Oxus/Amu Darya) and Syr Darya, to Sindh (present day &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;), by &lt;a href=\"Umayyad%20Caliphate\"&gt;Umayyad&lt;/a&gt;, naval cove of privateer in &lt;a href=\"La%20Garde-Freinet\"&gt;La Garde-Freinet&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Emirate%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba\"&gt;Cordoban Emirate&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20raid%20against%20Rome\"&gt;Sack of Rome&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Aghlabids\"&gt;Aghlabids&lt;/a&gt; in later era"
