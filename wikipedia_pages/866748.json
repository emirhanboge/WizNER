    "text": "Nashia inaguensis is an &lt;a href=\"evergreen\"&gt;evergreen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt;, commonly referred to as Moujean tea, Bahamas berry, or pineapple verbena. It is native to the east &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; islands, in particular the island of &lt;a href=\"Inagua\"&gt;Inagua&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bahamas\"&gt;Bahamas&lt;/a&gt;, after which the species is named. In its native environment, the plant crawls along sunny, rocky outcroppings, semi-protected from steady high winds.\nIt is a loose, spreading shrub with many branches up to 2 m high, with mature trunks of 5\u201310\u00a0cm diameter. The &lt;a href=\"Leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are aromatic, simple, opposite (or fascicled), elliptic to obovate or spatulate, 5\u201310\u00a0mm long, with revolute margins. The &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;heads are axillary, sessile, few-flowered, with a strigose calyx; the corolla is whitish, about 2\u00a0mm long, four-lobed, and with four stamens. The fragrant foliage and tiny white flowers are highly attractive to pollinators, in particular the &lt;a href=\"Eumaeus%20atala\"&gt;Atala butterfly&lt;/a&gt;.\nCultivation and uses.\nIt is often used as a bonsai plant due to its miniaturized features. The flowers form in clusters and are followed by reddish orange berries. It prefers full sun, warmth (a minimum temperature of 5\u00a0\u00b0C) and must be kept under high humidity. Even a brief spell of dryness can kill the plant. It can be propagated from cuttings, preferably in the spring and early summer during warm nights. A &lt;a href=\"decoction\"&gt;decoction&lt;/a&gt; of the fragrant leaves, variously described as having the scent and flavor of citrus, vanilla, or pineapple, is used as an herbal tea.\nReferences.\n Lamiales of North America Update, database (version 2011)"
