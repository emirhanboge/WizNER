    "text": "Knoxville High School was a public &lt;a href=\"high%20school\"&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Knoxville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, that operated from 1910 to 1951, enrolling grades 10 to 12. Its building is a &lt;a href=\"contributing%20property\"&gt;contributing property&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emory%20Place%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Emory Place Historic District&lt;/a&gt;, which is listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;. The building was more recently used for &lt;a href=\"adult%20education\"&gt;adult education&lt;/a&gt; programs offered by &lt;a href=\"Knox%20County%20Schools\"&gt;Knox County Schools&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe building is currently being converted into &lt;a href=\"Assisted%20Living\"&gt;senior assisted living&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nThe Knoxville High School building, located on East Fifth Avenue in Knoxville, was completed in 1910, enrolling male and female students who had previously attended separate high schools. W. J. Barton was the school's first &lt;a href=\"school%20principal\"&gt;principal&lt;/a&gt;. W. E. Evans served as principal from 1917 until the school closed in 1951. Enrollment grew to just over 2,000 in the early 1920s and reached a peak of about 2,300 around the beginning of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe school was known for many years as a school sports powerhouse, winning a total of 13 Tennessee state championships and six Southern championships in &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, as well as national championships in 1930 and 1937.\nBy 1948, the building had become inadequate, and city schools Superintendent Tom Prince warned that the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Association%20of%20Colleges%20and%20Schools\"&gt;Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools&lt;/a&gt; was threatening to strip Knoxville High's accreditation. In response, the city built three new schools: &lt;a href=\"Fulton%20High%20School%20%28Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee%29\"&gt;Fulton High School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20High%20School%20%28Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee%29\"&gt;West High School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austin-East%20High%20School\"&gt;East High School&lt;/a&gt;, and made improvements to &lt;a href=\"South-Doyle%20High%20School\"&gt;South High School&lt;/a&gt; and Austin High. Knoxville High closed in 1951.\nAfter the school was closed, the city school district used the building for administrative offices. Following consolidation of the city and county schools, Knox County Schools has used the building for adult education.\nBuilding.\nThe original Knoxville High School building was designed in a &lt;a href=\"Neoclassical%20architecture\"&gt;classical revival&lt;/a&gt; style by Knoxville &lt;a href=\"architect\"&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Baumann%20family%20%28architects%29\"&gt;Albert Baumann Sr.&lt;/a&gt;, who also designed the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Post%20Office%20and%20Courthouse%20%28Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee%29\"&gt;Knoxville Post Office and Federal Building&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Johnson%20Hotel\"&gt;Andrew Johnson Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, and the Cherokee Country Club, as well as some of the city's early-20th-century &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20architecture\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; homes. The building was expanded in both 1914 and 1920 to accommodate increased enrollment.\nThe building is included in the Emory Place Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 10, 1994. Knox Heritage, a local &lt;a href=\"historic%20preservation\"&gt;historic preservation&lt;/a&gt; organization, included it on its 2010 \"Fragile Fifteen\" list of endangered historic properties due to concerns about its ongoing maintenance. A &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; monument, erected in 1921, stands on the school's front lawn.\nNotable alumni.\nNotable people who attended Knoxville High School include the following:"
