    "text": "The Republican Guard () is a militarized &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20albania\"&gt;government agency of Albania&lt;/a&gt; mandated by law to protect high-ranking state officials, including the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Albania\"&gt;President of Albania&lt;/a&gt;, as well as certain national properties, high-ranking foreign visitors and diplomatic offices. It is mostly subordinate to the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20%28Albania%29\"&gt;Ministry of Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, except that the unit responsible for the president's security being under the authority of the president.\nThe Guard was established on 24 June 1928 as part of the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Albanian Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. Its current commander is General Gramos Sako.\nHistory.\nRoyal Guard (1928\u20131939).\nThe Republican Guard was established in the late 1920s when President &lt;a href=\"Ahmet%20Zogu\"&gt;Ahmet Zogu&lt;/a&gt; (later King Zog I) demanded the reorganization of the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Albanian Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of a special unit, separated from the Militias and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Albanian%20Gendarmerie\"&gt;Gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt;, whose main duty would be to protect the highest state personalities and the important buildings (such as Institutions; Banks; personalities houses; etc.). The creation of the Guard was decreed on 24 June 1928. Its secondary responsibility was &lt;a href=\"public%20duties\"&gt;public duties&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirana\"&gt;Tirana&lt;/a&gt;, the national capital.\nOn 1 September 1928, Albania was transformed into a kingdom, and President Zogu became Zog I, \"King of the Albanians\". The Guard changed the name to \"Royal Guard of Albania\", but the duties in most of them remain the same. Hysen Selmani was appointed its first commandant.\nIn November 1929, the law \"On the Organization of Armed Forces\" was promulgated, which changed the structure of the unit. The structure of the Guard subsequently consisted of:\nSocialist Republican Guard (1945\u20131991).\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the Guard would be named Special Battalion of the General Staff, being a structure within the \"People's Defense Division (DMP)\".\nIn February 1947, the department was renamed Republican Guard Department. By the end of the 1940s, the Guard began to recruit servicemen through the &lt;a href=\"conscription\"&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt; service; until then it consisted of ex-&lt;a href=\"Partisan%20%28military%29\"&gt;Partisans&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20National%20Liberation%20Army\"&gt;Albanian National Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; \"(UN\u00c7SH)\". In 1951, the Guard became part of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20%28Albania%29\"&gt;Ministry of Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, which charged the battalion with the function of preserving and securing the high-ranking state officials and important members of the &lt;a href=\"Party%20of%20Labour%20of%20Albania\"&gt;communist party&lt;/a&gt;, including their residential areas in &lt;a href=\"Ish-Blloku\"&gt;Ish-Blloku&lt;/a&gt;. During these years until November 1968, the Guard was strengthened and modernized, following which the guard battalion numbered around 600 personnel of all ranks.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Soviet-Albanian%20split\"&gt;Soviet-Albanian split&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; in 1968, the Guard underwent a structural and quantitative change. It was increased from 1 to 3 battalions. In addition, there were 4 battalions of reservists, a central Command and permanent staff with officers. Also, the &lt;a href=\"Artillery\"&gt;Artillery&lt;/a&gt; Command was created.\nIn 1976, with the adoption of the new Constitution, the name of the Guard changed to the Republican Guard Regiment of the Socialist Republic of Albania\nIts organization included:\nOn 4 February 1984 the Presidium of the People's Assembly awarded the \"Order of the National Flag\" to the Republican Guard Regiment.\n1991\u2013Present.\nOn 9 September 1992, the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Parliament\"&gt;Albanian Parliament&lt;/a&gt; adopted the law \"On the Republican Guard\", which stipulated that the guard, which at the time was named the Specialized Military Unit, would be the official military guard of honour for the state. In 1993, based on the June 1928 decree of the Guard's creation, the Republican Guard was recreated in its original form. In appreciation for the unit's participation in the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Albanian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; of 1997, the Republican Guard was decorated with the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Medal%20of%20the%20Eagle\"&gt;Golden Medal of the Eagle&lt;/a&gt; (\u201cMedalja e Art\u00eb e Shqiponj\u00ebs\u201d) on its &lt;a href=\"diamond%20jubilee\"&gt;diamond jubilee&lt;/a&gt; in 1998. In January 2011, six members of the guard were arrested over the deaths of four civilian protesters in an &lt;a href=\"2011%20Albanian%20opposition%20demonstrations\"&gt;opposition demonstration&lt;/a&gt; outside Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Sali%20Berisha\"&gt;Sali Berisha&lt;/a&gt;'s office. Three of them were later released by the general prosecutor.\nMission.\nThe Republican Guard Battalion of Albania is a structure of special status in the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20%28Albania%29\"&gt;Ministry of Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, whose mission is to provide &lt;a href=\"physical%20security\"&gt;physical security&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Albania\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Chairman%20of%20the%20Parliament%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Chairman of the Parliament&lt;/a&gt; and other high state personalities defined in the No. 8869, dated 22 May 2003 \"For the Guard of the Republic of Albania\".
