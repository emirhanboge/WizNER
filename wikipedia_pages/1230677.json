    "text": "Yang Manchun is the name given to the &lt;a href=\"Goguryeo\"&gt;Goguryeo&lt;/a&gt; commander of Ansi Fortress in the 640s. Ansi Fortress was located on the Goguryeo\u2013&lt;a href=\"Tang%20Dynasty\"&gt;Tang&lt;/a&gt; border, probably present-day &lt;a href=\"Haicheng%2C%20Liaoning\"&gt;Haicheng&lt;/a&gt;. Yang is sometimes credited with saving the kingdom by his successful &lt;a href=\"First%20campaign%20in%20the%20Goguryeo%E2%80%93Tang%20War\"&gt;defense against Tang Taizong&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nThe real name of the defender of Ansi Fortress is unclear. &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Busik\"&gt;Kim Busik&lt;/a&gt;, in his \"&lt;a href=\"Samguk%20Sagi\"&gt;Samguk Sagi&lt;/a&gt;\" (Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms), lamented that the name of the steadfast commander of Ansi Fortress was unknown:\nHowever, an author by the name of &lt;a href=\"Xiong%20Damu\"&gt;Xiong Damu&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ming Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; used the name Liang Wanchun (\u6881\u4e07\u6625) to refer to the defender in his Historical Fiction novel \"Tangshu Zhizhuan Tongsu Yanyi\". During the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20invasions%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Japanese invasions of Korea&lt;/a&gt;, the Ming generals Wu Zongdao and Li Shifa said to &lt;a href=\"Yun%20Geun%20Su\"&gt;Yun Geun Su&lt;/a&gt; that the defender's name is Liang Wanchun. In 1669, Hyeonjong of Joseon asked &lt;a href=\"Song%20Jungil\"&gt;Song Jungil&lt;/a&gt; for his name and he gave his name as Ryang Manchun, the Korean way of pronouncing the Hanja \"\u6881\u4e07\u6625\".\"The Collected works of Master Dongchundang\" (\ub3d9\ucd98\ub2f9\uc120\uc0dd\ubcc4\uc9d1, \u540c\u6625\u5802\u5148\u751f\u5225\u96c6) by (\uc1a1\uc900\uae38, \u5b8b\u6d5a\u5409), first compiled in 1768, includes the passage: \"Someone asked, 'What was the name of the commander of Ansi fortress?' Jungil replied, 'It was Ryang Manchun. He skillfully checked the army of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Taizong%20of%20Tang\"&gt;Taizong&lt;/a&gt; and so might we very well call him \"seonsu seongja\" (\uc120\uc218\uc131\uc790, \u5584\u5b88\u57ce\u8005, \"capable defender of fortresses\"). However, due to the Korean Pronunciation rule called Tu'eum Beopchik (\ub450\uc74c\ubc95\uce59), Ryang Manchun (\ub7c9\ub9cc\ucd98) was pronounced as Yang Manchun (\uc591\ub9cc\ucd98). As such, his name slowly began to be mistakenly interpreted as (\u694a\u842c\u6625). In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jehol%20Diary\"&gt;The Jehol Diary&lt;/a&gt;\" written by &lt;a href=\"Bak%20Jiwon%20%28born%201737%29\"&gt;Park Ji-won&lt;/a&gt; in the 18th century includes the following: \"When Yang Manchun, the master of Anshi-s\u014fng Fortress, shot an arrow and put out the eye of the Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty, the emperor assembled his army under the wall. This was not the signal for an immediate attack, but to demonstrate the Emperor's generosity in granting Yang Manchun one hundred p'il roll of silk, praising him for defending the Fortress successfully for his own &lt;a href=\"Koreans\"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"king\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;.\" In time Yang Manchun came into general use as the name of the defender of Ansi Fortress.\nInvolvement in the Goguryeo\u2013Tang War.\nIn 642, &lt;a href=\"Yeon%20Gaesomun\"&gt;Yeon Gaesomun&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"Yeongnyu%20of%20Goguryeo\"&gt;King Yeongnyu&lt;/a&gt; and seized military control over the country. However, although Yeon had quickly gained control over the rest of the country, Yang Manchun refused to surrender Ansi fortress. After a lengthy siege and repeated unsuccessful attempts to storm the fortress, Yeon was forced to withdraw and allow Yang to keep his position as fortress commander. This proved to be to his advantage.\nIn 645, Taizong led a &lt;a href=\"First%20campaign%20in%20the%20Goguryeo%E2%80%93Tang%20War\"&gt;campaign against Goguryeo&lt;/a&gt;. Some Goguryeo border fortresses fell early, but Tang was unable to reduce Ansi fortress. Goguryeo sent a force reported at 150,000 to raise the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Ansi\"&gt;siege of Ansi&lt;/a&gt; fortress, but the force was unable to reach it. Despite its siege of Ansi, the Tang army was unable to force its capitulation. Taizong eventually ordered the construction of a large earthen siege ramp, which Yang instead captured and used as part of his defense. When &lt;a href=\"winter\"&gt;winter&lt;/a&gt; approached, Tang forces were forced to withdraw.\nThe siege of Ansi fortress is related in detail (but without the commander's name) in the \"&lt;a href=\"Samguk%20Sagi\"&gt;Samguk Sagi&lt;/a&gt;\", Goguryeo vol. 9. (vol. 21 overall)."
