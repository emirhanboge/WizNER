In the sexually frustrated and impoverished society lacking healthy outlets for sexual needs, boys as young as seven are prostituted for petty cash in makeshift hostels. The film was screened at the &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Doc/Fest\"&gt;Sheffield Doc/Fest&lt;/a&gt; (2014), and won Best Documentary at the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Association\"&gt;United Nations Association&lt;/a&gt; Film Festival (2014).\nIn 2015, Naqvi directed \"&lt;a href=\"Among%20the%20Believers%20%28film%29\"&gt;Among the Believers&lt;/a&gt;\" with &lt;a href=\"Hemal%20Trivedi\"&gt;Hemal Trivedi&lt;/a&gt;.

The film highlights &lt;a href=\"Maulana%20Abdul%20Aziz%20Ghazi\"&gt;Maulana Abdul Aziz Ghazi&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s role as the leader of the Red Mosque, pushing for a hardline interpretation of Islam and &lt;a href=\"Jihad\"&gt;Jihad&lt;/a&gt;. As a counterpoint, the film also features the &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20physicist\"&gt;nuclear physicist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"civil%20activist\"&gt;civil activist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pervez%20Hoodbhoy\"&gt;Pervez Hoodbhoy&lt;/a&gt; who champions a secular education system in favor of &lt;a href=\"tolerant\"&gt;tolerant&lt;/a&gt; and progressive values. These differing ideologies play out in the state sanctioned vacuum of educational and financial infrastructure in poverty stricken villages of Pakistan, which the Red Mosque is quick to fill in exchange for young recruits.\nThe film has its US premiere at &lt;a href=\"Tribeca%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Tribeca Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; on April 17, 2015. It has since won many awards, including Best Feature at the &lt;a href=\"ALBA%20Human%20Rights%20Documentary%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;ALBA Human Rights Documentary Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, Best of Fest at &lt;a href=\"Chagrin%20Documentary%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Chagrin Documentary Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; (2017), Best Documentary at &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Hollywood Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; (2015), Best International Documentary at &lt;a href=\"Oaxaca%20FilmFest\"&gt;Oaxaca FilmFest&lt;/a&gt; (2015), and more.\nIn April 2016, the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Board%20of%20Film%20Censors\"&gt;Central Board of Film Censors&lt;/a&gt; banned \"Among the Believers\" from being screened in Pakistan, giving the reason that it \u201cprojects the negative image of Pakistan in the context of ongoing fight against extremism terrorism.\u201d Both Naqvi and co-director &lt;a href=\"Hemal%20Trivedi\"&gt;Hemal Trivedi&lt;/a&gt; received death threats after the release of the film, forcing them to go into hiding for a period of time.\nIn 2017, Naqvi directed, wrote, and produced \"Insha\u2019Allah Democracy\" with producer &lt;a href=\"Jared%20Ian%20Goldman\"&gt;Jared Ian Goldman&lt;/a&gt;. The documentary follows the controversial former military dictator of Pakistan, General &lt;a href=\"Pervez%20Musharraf\"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;, as he returns to Pakistan to contest in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Pakistani%20general%20election\"&gt;2013 Pakistani general election&lt;/a&gt;. Naqvi himself features prominently in the film, as a citizen voting in the country\u2019s general elections for the first time. As a member of the Shia minority, Naqvi is attracted to Musharraf\u2019s secular stance and past crackdowns on sectarian violence. The film examines the contradictions and complexities of a nascent democratic process in a country recovering from a long history of military rule.\nThe film had its world premiere at Sheffield Doc/Fest (2017), where it was nominated for the Tim Hetherington Award. It has also screened at &lt;a href=\"Films%20from%20the%20South\"&gt;Films from the South&lt;/a&gt; (2017), &lt;a href=\"DOC%20NYC\"&gt;DOC NYC&lt;/a&gt; (2017), &lt;a href=\"International%20Documentary%20Film%20Festival%20Amsterdam\"&gt;IDFA&lt;/a&gt; (2017), &lt;a href=\"Festival%20International%20de%20Programmes%20Audiovisuels\"&gt;FIPA&lt;/a&gt; (2018), &lt;a href=\"Human%20Rights%20Watch\"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; Film Festival (2018), and the UK Asian Film Festival (2018).\nPakistani activists in the UK called for the film to be banned from its London premiere at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival (2018), claiming that the film \"legitimises and glorifies military dictatorial rules and undermines civilian/parliament supremacy.\u201d In response the Human Rights Watch released a statement saying that the film was chosen because of its criticism of military rule.\nNaqvi\u2019s next film, \"The Accused: Damned or Devoted?\", which he directed and produced, was released in 2020. The film follows the rise of the cleric &lt;a href=\"Khadim%20Hussain%20Rizvi\"&gt;Khadim Hussain Rizvi&lt;/a&gt; as he pushes to preserve Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws by rallying millions of supporters, running for elections, and silencing those attempting to change the law by condemning them to death. It also follows &lt;a href=\"Asia%20Bibi%20blasphemy%20case\"&gt;Asia Bibi&lt;/a&gt;, a Christian woman falsely accused of blasphemy, as well as activist &lt;a href=\"Gulalai%20Ismail\"&gt;Gulalai Ismail&lt;/a&gt; as she is falsely accused of blasphemy.\nWhen he was initially approached to make a film about the blasphemy laws in Pakistan, Naqvi refused because of the potential security risk. Naqvi did eventually make the film, and has said that it is \u201cthe most dangerous film\u201d he has worked on.\nThe film won Best Investigation at the Asian Media Awards (2020). It was a runner-up in the Feature Documentary category at the South Asian Film Festival of Montr\u00e9al (2020). It was also nominated for the CPH: DOX F:ACT Award (2020), and in the International Affairs Documentary category for the AIB Media Excellence awards (2020)."
