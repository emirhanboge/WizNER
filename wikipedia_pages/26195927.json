    "text": "The Argentine Army Aviation (, AvEj) is the &lt;a href=\"army%20aviation\"&gt;army aviation&lt;/a&gt; branch of the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Army\"&gt;Argentine Army&lt;/a&gt;. Their members have the same rank insignia and titles as the rest of the Army.\nAlong with its primary role of supporting Army operations, the Army Aviation is highly involved in humanitarian aid missions, emergency relief, medical evacuations and forest &lt;a href=\"firefighting\"&gt;firefighting&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nMilitary aviation in Argentina traces back to the &lt;a href=\"Paraguayan%20War\"&gt;Paraguayan War&lt;/a&gt; when, on 8 July 1867, Staff Sergeant Roberto A. Chodasiewicz used an &lt;a href=\"observation%20balloon\"&gt;observation balloon&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Humait%C3%A1\"&gt;battle of Humait\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the army was the main driving force behind national aeronautical development. The use of enthusiastic students who relied on the selfless support of civil institutions and air clubs, saw the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20Aviation%20School\"&gt;Military Aviation School&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"El%20Palomar%2C%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;El Palomar&lt;/a&gt; in 1912.\nThe establishment of the Army Aviation Service (in Spanish, \"Servicio de Aviaci\u00f3n del Ej\u00e9rcito\") saw a great expansion of Argentine air power in the 1912\u20131945 period, and supported the development of civil aviation in Argentina. The creation of the first aviation units and the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Fabrica%20Militar%20de%20Aviones\"&gt;F\u00e1brica Militar de Aviones&lt;/a&gt; in the 1920s were the beginning of a process that lead to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Argentine Air Force&lt;/a&gt; in 1945, to which the Army transferred its aircraft and related installations.\nRe-establishment.\nIn 1956, Army Aviation was re-established within the Army and began a major expansion, incorporating new types of aircraft and opening new bases around the country. In 1965, using a &lt;a href=\"Cessna%20185\"&gt;Cessna U-17&lt;/a&gt; they performed their first expedition to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Pole\"&gt;South Pole&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 1970s the service consolidated itself as an important branch of the Army receiving aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Aeritalia%20G.222\"&gt;Aeritalia G.222&lt;/a&gt; transport which caused friction with the Air Force. The expansion plans continued in the early 1980s with the incorporation of the &lt;a href=\"Agusta%20A109\"&gt;Agusta A109&lt;/a&gt; utility and the &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20CH-47%20Chinook\"&gt;Boeing CH-47 Chinook&lt;/a&gt; heavy-lift helicopters.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Proceso%20de%20Reorganizacion%20Nacional\"&gt;dictatorship&lt;/a&gt; that took power in 1976 increased &lt;a href=\"Argentina%E2%80%93Chile%20relations\"&gt;tensions with Chile&lt;/a&gt; which reached their highest point during the 1978 &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Soberan%C3%ADa\"&gt;Operation Soberan\u00eda&lt;/a&gt; where the Army Aviation performed major deployments.\nFalklands War.\nIn 1982, the \"Military Junta\" invaded the &lt;a href=\"Falkland%20Islands\"&gt;Falkland Islands&lt;/a&gt; () triggering a ten-week-long war against the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The Argentine Army Aviation deployed 2 &lt;a href=\"CH-47%20Chinook\"&gt;CH-47 Chinook&lt;/a&gt;s, 3 &lt;a href=\"Agusta%20A109\"&gt;Agusta A109&lt;/a&gt;, 6 &lt;a href=\"A%C3%A9rospatiale%20Puma\"&gt;SA330 Puma&lt;/a&gt;s and 9 &lt;a href=\"UH-1H\"&gt;UH-1H&lt;/a&gt;s to the islands, where they performed 796 general support flights under harsh operating conditions. Their helicopters were also extensively used in &lt;a href=\"Patagonia\"&gt;Patagonia&lt;/a&gt; and the Army also took over the &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires%20Provincial%20Police\"&gt;provincial police&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"MBB%20Bo%20105\"&gt;MBB Bo 105&lt;/a&gt;s during the conflict.\nSix Army aviation members died in the war. Two army helicopters were shot down, six destroyed on the ground, and ten were captured. Some of these captured were used by British Army and other used as targets for RAF ground attack training.\nPresent Day.\nAfter the war, the &lt;a href=\"Aerospatiale%20Super%20Puma\"&gt;Aerospatiale Super Puma&lt;/a&gt; was incorporated, mainly for &lt;a href=\"Antartida%20Argentina\"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; support duties operating from Navy's icebreaker &lt;a href=\"ARA%20Almirante%20Ir%C3%ADzar%20%28Q-5%29\"&gt;ARA \"Almirante Irizar\"&lt;/a&gt;. In 1998, Argentina was granted &lt;a href=\"Major%20non-NATO%20ally\"&gt;Major Non-NATO ally&lt;/a&gt; status by United States President &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and the Army Aviation began an expansive program that included the reception of &lt;a href=\"OV-1%20Mohawk\"&gt;OV-1 Mohawk&lt;/a&gt;s and surplus &lt;a href=\"UH-1H\"&gt;UH-1H&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"US%20Army\"&gt;US Army&lt;/a&gt;. The US also authorized the delivery of 12 &lt;a href=\"AH-1%20Cobra\"&gt;AH-1F Cobra&lt;/a&gt; gunships but the operation was halted by the Argentine Government.\nIn the 1990s, the Aviation Army began its &lt;a href=\"Unmanned%20aerial%20vehicle\"&gt;Unmanned aerial vehicle&lt;/a&gt; program, the Lipan series.&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20120301193350/http%3A//www.ejercito.mil.ar/lipan/TALLER%2520LIPAN%2520EDIT.jpg\"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; In 2007, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defense%20%28Argentina%29\"&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/a&gt; evaluated the Chinese &lt;a href=\"Changhe%20Z-11\"&gt;Changhe Z-11&lt;/a&gt; (Argentine index &lt;a href=\"AE-350\"&gt;AE-350&lt;/a&gt;) and 40 are to be built. Also in 2007, the Army unveiled the indigenous &lt;a href=\"Cicar%C3%A9%20CH-14\"&gt;Cicar\u00e9 CH-14 Aguilucho&lt;/a&gt; scout prototype &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DeBFUBv2Iec4\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. A major update program is currently underway refitting the Hueys to the &lt;a href=\"Huey%20II\"&gt;Huey II&lt;/a&gt; variant. In March 2010 it was announced the purchase of five Bell 206 for the Joint &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Argentina\"&gt;armed forces&lt;/a&gt; school.\nArmy aircraft with tactical camouflage have adopted high-visibility yellow markings \"Ej\u00e9rcito\" (&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; for \u201cArmy\u201d) in order to encourage the national press to stop referring to them as belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Air%20Force\"&gt;air force&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 2014 celebration of the Argentine Army Aviation day, the following actions to improve capabilities were confirmed:\nCurrently, Argentina has expressed interest in buying surplus US equipment and authorization granted by US government. This may involve Transport or Scout helicopters.\nOrganisation.\nUnits and bases.\nThe main airbase is located at &lt;a href=\"Campo%20de%20Mayo\"&gt;Campo de Mayo&lt;/a&gt; where training and maintenance is done. The units based there are as follows:\nThe service has also permanent forward location bases assigned to both division and brigade HQ levels.\nPilot recruitment and training.\nThe Argentine Army gets its pilots from two main sources. One is the officers who graduate from the Military College and then volunteer for the Army Aviator Course. This course lasts one year and takes place at either the Air Force Academy, in C\u00f3rdoba (for fixed wing aircraft), or the Army Aviation School (for helicopters), in Campo de Mayo, outside Buenos Aires. Since 2009, these two schools are the only training centers for pilots from the three armed services. The other source is civilian pilots who, after a ten-month course at the Military Academy, join the Army Aviation as 2nd lieutenants.\nWhile College-graduated officers are called \u201cArmy Aviators\u201d and those coming from civilian life are \u201cArmy Pilots\u201d, there are no specific technical differences between them. However, \u201cArmy Pilots\u201d can only reach the rank of colonel. Also, \u201cArmy Aviators\u201d retain their original branch (i.e. Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineers, Signals or Ordnance) and can be posted to their branch's units in case of need. \u201cArmy Pilots\u201d, instead, can only serve in Army Aviation units or related positions, as they have no other capability.\nAircraft inventory.\nThe Argentine Army Aviation inventory includes the following aircraft."
