    "text": "Koviyar (, also known as Covia) is a &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Tamils\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt; caste found in &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;. They are traditional agriculturalists and temple workers. \"Kattavarayan\" as &lt;a href=\"Village%20deities%20of%20Tamils%20of%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;caste deity&lt;/a&gt; is observed by the Koviar.\nEtymology.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Yalpana%20Vaipava%20Malai\"&gt;Yalpana Vaipava Malai&lt;/a&gt; states that the term \"Koviyar\" stems from &lt;a href=\"Koil\"&gt;\"Kovil\"&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20language\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt; term meaning temple. Another view holds that the term is derived from the Tamil words \"Ko\" (cow) and \"&lt;a href=\"Idaiyar\"&gt;Idaiyar&lt;/a&gt;\", meaning cowherds.\nAnother theory states that they are descended from Sinhala prisoners of war, and that Kovi is a Tamilised form of the Sinhala &lt;a href=\"Govigama\"&gt;Govi&lt;/a&gt;. Tamil dirge songs sung by &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Vellalar\"&gt;Vellalar&lt;/a&gt; women during funeral rituals carried out by Koviyar refer to them as Sinhalas (\"O you Kovia, Sinhala\"). \nVellalar men often took concubines from the Koviyar community, and the children are entitled to Vellalar status as well as certain paternal inheritances.\nHistory.\nEarly period.\nThey are mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Thesavalamai\"&gt;Thesavalamai law&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Jaffna%20Peninsula\"&gt;Jaffna Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, which was codified by the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Ceylon\"&gt;Dutch under their rule&lt;/a&gt;. There they are stated as descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Vellalar\"&gt;Sri Lankan Vellalar&lt;/a&gt;. Intermarriages between the Vellalars and Koviyars were common. Other traditions account that they were &lt;a href=\"Sinhalese%20people\"&gt;Sinhalese&lt;/a&gt; captives from the &lt;a href=\"Govigama\"&gt;Govigama&lt;/a&gt; caste who were settled in &lt;a href=\"Jaffna%20Kingdom\"&gt;Jaffna Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, suggested by their ritual status being equal to that of the Vellalars with whom they share similar traditional occupation with. The \"Vaiya Padal\" states that they were one of the castes who came from &lt;a href=\"Tamilakam\"&gt;Tamil country&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Southern%20India\"&gt;Southern India&lt;/a&gt; and were apparently herdsmen.\nColonial period.\nThe political rise of the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Vellalar\"&gt;Vellalar&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Ceylon\"&gt;Dutch Ceylon&lt;/a&gt;, pushed the Koviyar along with the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Pallar\"&gt;Pallar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nalavar\"&gt;Nalavar&lt;/a&gt; into slavery through the legalisation of the \"&lt;a href=\"Thesavalamai\"&gt;Thesavalamai&lt;/a&gt;\" law, who were a group initially bound to only serve the state as &lt;a href=\"Tenant%20farmer\"&gt;tenant farmers&lt;/a&gt;. They were after the abolishment of slavery considered as domestic servants or \"Kudimakkal\" for a section of dominant castes, and had the role as ceremony officiators. \nModern period.\nAfter Sri Lanka\u2019s independence from &lt;a href=\"UK\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; in 1948, &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Tamil%20nationalism\"&gt;Sri Lankan Tamil politics&lt;/a&gt; was geared towards a nationalistic cause. Koviyar using their ritual and physical proximity to the educational services upgraded themselves socially and economically. The &lt;a href=\"Policy%20of%20standardization\"&gt;Policy of standardization&lt;/a&gt; imposed by the successive Sri Lankan governments since 1973 had the effect of restricting the number of Tamil students entering state &lt;a href=\"Universities\"&gt;Universities&lt;/a&gt; and affected upwardly mobile Koviyar students as much as the dominant class. Hence Koviyar were also involved in many of the Tamil nationalistic agitations that eventually resulted in the formation of &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Tamil%20militant%20groups\"&gt;many Tamil militant groups&lt;/a&gt;. They were prominent in one of them namely &lt;a href=\"TELO\"&gt;TELO&lt;/a&gt; that was eventually eclipsed by the &lt;a href=\"LTTE\"&gt;LTTE&lt;/a&gt; that was also seen as to be associated with &lt;a href=\"Karaiyar\"&gt;Karaiyar&lt;/a&gt; caste in &lt;a href=\"Jaffna\"&gt;Jaffna&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20July\"&gt;Black July&lt;/a&gt; pogroms have retarded most of these gains and many have escaped the deprivations by seeking &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt; status in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;. They are merging with the host populations and/or the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Tamil%20diaspora\"&gt;Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora&lt;/a&gt;."
