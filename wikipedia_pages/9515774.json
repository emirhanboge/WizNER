    "title": "Ulbricht Group",
    "text": "The Ulbricht Group was a group of exiled members of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Communist Party of Germany&lt;/a&gt; (\"Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands\", or KPD), led by &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Ulbricht\"&gt;Walter Ulbricht&lt;/a&gt;, who flew from the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; back to Germany on April 30, 1945. Composed of functionaries from the KPD and ten anti-fascist &lt;a href=\"prisoner%20of%20war\"&gt;prisoners of war&lt;/a&gt;, their job was to seek out &lt;a href=\"Anti-fascism\"&gt;anti-fascist&lt;/a&gt; individuals and prepare the groundwork for the re-establishment of communist organizations and unions in postwar &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. There were two additional regional groups, the &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Ackermann\"&gt;Ackermann&lt;/a&gt; Group in &lt;a href=\"Saxony\"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Sobottka\"&gt;Sobottka&lt;/a&gt; Group in &lt;a href=\"Mecklenburg\"&gt;Mecklenburg&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the group's members later became high-level officials in the government of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;German Democratic Republic&lt;/a&gt; (GDR).\nPolitical operation.\nThe tasks for the Ulbricht Group and the other communist &lt;a href=\"Professional%20revolutionaries\"&gt;cadre&lt;/a&gt; who were to return to Germany were defined at a meeting between &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Pieck\"&gt;Wilhelm Pieck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgi%20Dimitrov\"&gt;Georgi Dimitrov&lt;/a&gt; held in Moscow on April 25, 1945. Dimitrov was then a high-level functionary of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, working as the assistant division leader of the International Information Division. They were to prepare the region to accept and follow the instructions of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Military%20Administration%20in%20Germany\"&gt;Soviet Military Administration in Germany&lt;/a&gt; so the Nazi government could be dismantled. The &lt;a href=\"de-nazification\"&gt;de-nazification&lt;/a&gt; process was to convince the people to turn over Nazi &lt;a href=\"war%20criminal\"&gt;war criminal&lt;/a&gt;s. The Group was to calm people and assure them that the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; would neither destroy nor enslave them, but that the German people had to understand that they bore the responsibility for the Nazi's rise to power, giving force to Hitler's policies and causing the catastrophe. The communists had tried to warn them of the coming catastrophe and they were now there to help them out of their distress and at the same time, establish a basis for the future of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). They were also to seek out anti-fascist individuals who would be willing to work with the new organizations. The youngest member of the group was 24-year-old &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Leonhard\"&gt;Wolfgang Leonhard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ulbricht Group left from the &lt;a href=\"Hotel%20Lux\"&gt;Hotel Lux&lt;/a&gt;, where they had been living in exile, some for years, and flew from &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Minsk\"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt;, then to &lt;a href=\"Calau\"&gt;Calau&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Mi%C4%99dzyrzecz\"&gt;Mi\u0119dzyrzecz&lt;/a&gt;. Not all members of the group knew what their assignment was or how long it would last until after they landed. They landed in an airfield and were met by a Soviet officer, who drove away with Ulbricht. The rest left by truck for &lt;a href=\"Altlandsberg\"&gt;Bruchm\u00fchle&lt;/a&gt;, about east of Berlin and the offices of Marshal &lt;a href=\"Georgy%20Zhukov\"&gt;Georgy Zhukov&lt;/a&gt;, the first commander of the Soviet occupation zone. The Ulbricht Group began working from there on May 2, 1945, though not much could be done with the city in flames after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;Battle of Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. In the evening, Ulbricht met with the group and explained their assignment. They were to cover all 20 districts in Berlin and begin building local administrations. In each, they were to seek out as many &lt;a href=\"social%20democracy\"&gt;social democrats&lt;/a&gt; as possible, also a civil servant with a &lt;a href=\"Ph.D\"&gt;Ph.D&lt;/a&gt; from each local administration who was willing to work with the Soviets and a cleric to lead a religious advisory council. Communists were to be installed in each district as assistant administrator, and to head up the departments for personnel and development. The group worked from Bruchm\u00fchle till May 8, after which they moved to the &lt;a href=\"Friedrichsfelde\"&gt;Friedrichsfelde&lt;/a&gt; area of Berlin.\nOn May 6, 1945, Ulbricht gave the Soviet commander of Berlin, &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Berzarin\"&gt;Nikolai Berzarin&lt;/a&gt;, the first list of suggested names to fill important administrative posts in Berlin. On May 12, 1945, the district administrators and city councils were appointed from Ulbricht's list without exception. Paul Markgraf, one of the ten anti-fascist prisoners of war, was appointed the \"Berlin Police President\", also on Ulbricht's initiative.\nIn the beginning of June 1945, Ulbricht, Ackermann and Sobottka traveled back to Moscow to give the first reports and get their further instructions. On June 4, 1945, they met with Pieck, &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Zhdanov\"&gt;Andrei Zhdanov&lt;/a&gt;. Stalin urged them to found a nationwide working class party that would remain open for the &lt;a href=\"proletariat\"&gt;proletariat&lt;/a&gt;, farmers and intellectuals. He wanted the party to work for a unified Germany and said in his opinion, the &lt;a href=\"West\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt; wanted to split the country into partitions, so, according to Pieck, their goal was to \"[complete] the civil-democratic revolution through a civil-democratic government.\" The founding manifesto of the KPD was written by Ackermann. In it, the new party spoke openly against a &lt;a href=\"sovietization\"&gt;sovietization&lt;/a&gt; of Germany. It said the goal was to \"continue to its conclusion the civil-democratic transformation begun with the &lt;a href=\"revolutions%20of%201848\"&gt;revolutions of 1848&lt;/a&gt;\" and through &lt;a href=\"land%20reform\"&gt;land reform&lt;/a&gt;, to eliminate the \"remnants of &lt;a href=\"feudalism\"&gt;feudalism&lt;/a&gt;\". The goal the Party named was as the \"establishment of an anti-fascist, democratic republic with all &lt;a href=\"fundamental%20rights\"&gt;democratic rights and freedoms&lt;/a&gt; for the people\". With the re-establishment of the KPD on June 11, 1945, the Ulbricht Group reached its first goal. On July 10, 1945, it moved into the KPD's Central Committee building.\nExistence concealed.\nUntil 1955 and the publication of Wolfgang Leonhard's book, \"Die Revolution entl\u00e4\u00dft ihre Kinder\" (later published in English as \"Child of the Revolution\"), knowledge of the Ulbricht Group was kept secret. In Leonhard's opinion, it was kept secret so as not to emphasize the role of communist exiles from Moscow in the establishment of the GDR. After 1955, several versions of the story appeared regarding the composition of the group and the order of events leading to the appointments.\nThere is disagreement among historians as to whether or not Stalin and Ackermann were earnest in their affirmation of parliamentarian democracy and fundamental rights. Leonhard reported the oft-cited comment by Ulbricht made during this period, \"It is quite clear. It must look democratic, but we must have everything &lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3Ain%20hand\"&gt;in hand&lt;/a&gt;.\" Some historians say that by spring 1945, the establishment of a communist-dominated government in the Soviet-occupied zone and the proclaimed democracy was merely a transitional stage but at least one historian believes that Stalin earnestly pursued a western-style democracy for Germany, that it was the only way he could secure the responsibility from &lt;a href=\"Allied-occupied%20Germany\"&gt;the others&lt;/a&gt;, which without him, would easily have been able to deny access to the resources of the &lt;a href=\"Ruhr%20region\"&gt;Ruhr region&lt;/a&gt;, reparations he desperately needed as resources to rebuild the war-ravaged western regions of the Soviet Union.\nRegional groups.\nThe group for Saxony was led by Anton Ackermann:\nThe group for &lt;a href=\"Mecklenburg\"&gt;Mecklenburg&lt;/a&gt; was led by Gustav Sobottka:"
