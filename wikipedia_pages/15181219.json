    "text": "Histone H2A type 1 is a &lt;a href=\"protein\"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; that in humans is encoded by the \"HIST1H2AG\" &lt;a href=\"gene\"&gt;gene&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Two molecules of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an octamer, around which approximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in repeating units, called nucleosomes. The linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a member of the histone H2A family. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails but instead contain a palindromic termination element. This gene is found in the histone microcluster on chromosome 6p21.33."
