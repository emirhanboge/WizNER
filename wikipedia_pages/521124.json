    "text": "Harold Norbert Kalas (March 26, 1936 \u2013 April 13, 2009) was an American &lt;a href=\"Sports%20commentator\"&gt;sportscaster&lt;/a&gt;, best known for his &lt;a href=\"Ford%20C.%20Frick%20Award\"&gt;Ford C. Frick Award-winning&lt;/a&gt; role as lead &lt;a href=\"Sports%20commentator\"&gt;play-by-play&lt;/a&gt; announcer for &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt;, a position he held from 1971 until his death in 2009.\nKalas was also closely identified with the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a &lt;a href=\"voice-over\"&gt;voice-over&lt;/a&gt; narrator for &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Films\"&gt;NFL Films&lt;/a&gt; productions (a regular feature on \"&lt;a href=\"Inside%20the%20NFL\"&gt;Inside the NFL&lt;/a&gt;\") and calling football games nationally for &lt;a href=\"NFL%20on%20Westwood%20One\"&gt;Westwood One&lt;/a&gt; radio.\nKalas collapsed in the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Nationals\"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt;' broadcast booth on April 13, 2009, about an hour before a Phillies game was scheduled to begin against the Nationals, and died soon afterward.\nEarly life and family.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Chicago%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Chicago, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, the son of a Methodist minister of Greek descent, Kalas graduated from &lt;a href=\"Naperville%20Central%20High%20School\"&gt;Naperville High School&lt;/a&gt; in 1954 and from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Iowa\"&gt;University of Iowa&lt;/a&gt; in 1959 where he was a member of &lt;a href=\"Phi%20Delta%20Theta%20Fraternity\"&gt;Phi Delta Theta Fraternity&lt;/a&gt;. Upon graduation, he was immediately drafted into the United States Army and stationed in Hawaii. After his discharge in 1961, Kalas began calling &lt;a href=\"minor-league\"&gt;minor-league&lt;/a&gt; baseball games for the &lt;a href=\"Hawaii%20Islanders\"&gt;Hawaii Islanders&lt;/a&gt;.\nKalas had three sons: Todd, Brad, and Kane. &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Kalas\"&gt;Todd Kalas&lt;/a&gt; was a Phillies broadcaster, worked as a pregame/postgame\u2013show host, and is currently a play-by-play announcer for the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kane%20Kalas\"&gt;Kane Kalas&lt;/a&gt; is a professional poker player.\nProfessional career.\nKalas made his major-league debut in 1965 with the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;, replacing &lt;a href=\"Al%20Helfer\"&gt;Al Helfer&lt;/a&gt; and working alongside &lt;a href=\"Gene%20Elston\"&gt;Gene Elston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loel%20Passe\"&gt;Loel Passe&lt;/a&gt;. He called the first game at Houston's Astrodome, on April 12, 1965.\nHe was hired by the Phillies in 1971 to succeed &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Campbell%20%28sportscaster%29\"&gt;Bill Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, and was the master of ceremonies at the 1971 opening of &lt;a href=\"Veterans%20Stadium\"&gt;Veterans Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. After the retirement of &lt;a href=\"By%20Saam\"&gt;By Saam&lt;/a&gt;, Kalas was paired with &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Musser\"&gt;Andy Musser&lt;/a&gt; and Hall of Fame player &lt;a href=\"Richie%20Ashburn\"&gt;Richie Ashburn&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nWhile initially meeting with a lukewarm reception due to his replacement of the popular Campbell, Kalas soon won the hearts of Phillies fans with his easy-going style, his mellow, baritone, leathery voice (which rose to great excitement upon great plays on the field or Phillies' home runs, especially in key situations), his love of the game and also his accessibility to Phillies fans, for whom he professed a strong love.\nDuring his Phillies career, he called six no-hit games, six National League Championship Series, and three World Series (1983, 1993, and 2008). However, due to &lt;a href=\"MLB\"&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt; rules at the time, he could not call the &lt;a href=\"1980%20World%20Series\"&gt;1980 World Series&lt;/a&gt;, as local broadcasters were not allowed to call games due to contract conflicts with MLB, &lt;a href=\"National%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Radio\"&gt;CBS Radio&lt;/a&gt;. Public outcry caused MLB to change its policies the following year.\nKalas also called the first game at Veterans Stadium (April 10, 1971), the last game at Veterans Stadium (September 28, 2003), and the first game at Citizens Bank Park (April 12, 2004).\nKalas was sidelined for a few days in late July 2008 to treat a detached &lt;a href=\"retina\"&gt;retina&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn April 8, 2009, the Phillies honored Kalas by having him throw out the &lt;a href=\"first%20pitch\"&gt;first pitch&lt;/a&gt; before a game against the Atlanta Braves. Kalas's pitch was part of the &lt;a href=\"pre-game%20ceremony\"&gt;pre-game ceremony&lt;/a&gt; in which the Phillies received their &lt;a href=\"2008%20World%20Series\"&gt;2008 World Series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"World%20Series%20ring\"&gt;championship rings&lt;/a&gt;. The ceremony would be part of Kalas's last home game.\nOn May 15, 2009, during a series in Washington, the Phillies visited the &lt;a href=\"White%20House\"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; and were congratulated by President &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; for their 2008 World Series championship. The visit had been postponed from April 14, due to Kalas's death the preceding day. The President mentioned Kalas, his voice, his love for the Phillies, and his legacy. This was the second of two tributes to Kalas in Washington. On April 21, eight days after Kalas's death, then\u2013U.S. Congressman &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Sestak\"&gt;Joe Sestak&lt;/a&gt; paid tribute to Kalas in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Sestak represented &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%27s%207th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district&lt;/a&gt;, where Kalas resided.\nRichie Ashburn.\nKalas and Ashburn became beloved figures in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, and also became best friends. They worked together for 27 seasons until Ashburn's death on September 9, 1997, of a &lt;a href=\"myocardial%20infarction\"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; in his sleep in a &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; hotel room after broadcasting a &lt;a href=\"Mets%E2%80%93Phillies%20rivalry\"&gt;Phillies/Mets game&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Shea%20Stadium\"&gt;Shea Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed by many that Kalas never got over the death of his partner and friend, openly stating more than 11 years afterward that he still grieved over Ashburn's death.\nMemorable calls.\nKalas' familiar home run call was \"\"Swing ... and a long drive, this ball is ... outta here! Home run &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Howard\"&gt;Ryan Howard&lt;/a&gt;!\nIf it was a gigantic home run, he sometimes inserted \"deep (left center)\" after \"and a long drive\" and described it as \"that ball's way outta here!\"\nAs a guest on &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Sunday%20Night%20Baseball\"&gt;Sunday Night Baseball&lt;/a&gt;\" on July 15, 2007, Kalas recounted that his famous \"outta here\" call originated in the mid-1970s. While standing around the batting cage during batting practice, he saw Phillies slugger &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Luzinski\"&gt;Greg Luzinski&lt;/a&gt; hit a ball into the upper deck, to which Philly shortstop &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Bowa\"&gt;Larry Bowa&lt;/a&gt; reacted with the words, \"Wow! That's way outta here.\" Kalas said that it had a nice \"unique ring to it and has been using it ever since\".\nOther broadcasters have used Kalas' \"outta here\" call, including &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Cohen\"&gt;Gary Cohen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Coleman\"&gt;Jerry Coleman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Padres\"&gt;San Diego Padres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duane%20Kuiper\"&gt;Duane Kuiper&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Underwood\"&gt;Matt Underwood&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Smith%20%28radio%29\"&gt;Terry Smith&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim\"&gt;Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nKalas made, arguably, his most memorable call on April 18, 1987, when &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Schmidt\"&gt;Mike Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; hit his 500th career home run. \nIn 1980, after the &lt;a href=\"1980%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;Phillies&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"1980%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;, Kalas and the rest of the Phillies' radio crew re-created the call that Kalas probably would have made when &lt;a href=\"Tug%20McGraw\"&gt;Tug McGraw&lt;/a&gt; struck out &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Wilson%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Willie Wilson&lt;/a&gt; to win Game 6 and the World Series between the Phillies and the &lt;a href=\"1980%20Kansas%20City%20Royals%20season\"&gt;Kansas City Royals&lt;/a&gt;. \nThis call was not made live by Kalas, as MLB radio-broadcasting regulations at the time forbade local stations from producing live coverage of World Series games, instead forcing them to air the national &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20CBS%20Radio\"&gt;CBS Radio&lt;/a&gt; feed of the games. Philadelphia fans were so outraged about this afterward that they started a letter-writing campaign to the &lt;a href=\"Commissioner%20of%20Baseball\"&gt;Commissioner's Office&lt;/a&gt;, demanding a change to the rule. Due at least in part to this outcry from Philadelphia fans, MLB amended its broadcasting contracts the following year to allow World Series teams' flagship radio stations to air the games with local announcers. Nevertheless, Kalas was part of the Phillies' World Series celebration in 1980, and rode in the team's victory parade down &lt;a href=\"Broad%20Street%20%28Philadelphia%29\"&gt;Broad Street&lt;/a&gt;.\nKalas did call the 1980 NLCS, but his call of the final out was drowned out by Tim McCarver's laughter.\nKalas called a grand slam home run by Mariano Duncan off Lee Smith in 1993:\nAnother memorable call by Kalas was his description of &lt;a href=\"Mitch%20Williams%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Mitch Williams&lt;/a&gt;'s strikeout of &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Pecota\"&gt;Bill Pecota&lt;/a&gt; for the final out of Game 6 of the &lt;a href=\"1993%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;1993 National League Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"1993%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;Phillies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1993%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;:\nAnother of Kalas' famous calls came less than two weeks later with &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Carter\"&gt;Joe Carter&lt;/a&gt;'s famous walk-off home run to end the &lt;a href=\"1993%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;, though the Phillies lost the series: \nOn April 4, &lt;a href=\"2003%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, Kalas called a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;grand slam&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Utley\"&gt;Chase Utley&lt;/a&gt; in Utley's major-league debut: \nOn June 14, &lt;a href=\"2004%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, Kalas called the 400th home run hit by &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Thome\"&gt;Jim Thome&lt;/a&gt;, using the call he used in later years when it was uncertain whether the ball would clear the fence: \nOn September 8, &lt;a href=\"2005%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, Kalas calls an eventual game-winning 3-run home run by Craig Biggio in top of the 9th off Billy Wagner.\nOn August 9, &lt;a href=\"2006%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, Kalas called a close play at the plate as Chase Utley scored from second base on a routine groundout against the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;: \nHere is Kalas's call of &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Myers\"&gt;Brett Myers&lt;/a&gt;' strikeout of &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Nationals\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Wily%20Mo%20Pena\"&gt;Wily Mo Pena&lt;/a&gt; to clinch the 2007 &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20East\"&gt;National League East&lt;/a&gt; division title for the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;Phillies&lt;/a&gt; on the last day of the season, completing a comeback as they erased a seven-game deficit behind the New York Mets in early September: \nKalas' call on the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;Phillies&lt;/a&gt;' victory in Game 5 of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;2008 NLCS&lt;/a&gt;: \nOn October 29, 2008, Kalas was finally able to call a Phillies' championship-winning moment in the World Series when &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Lidge\"&gt;Brad Lidge&lt;/a&gt; struck out &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Hinske\"&gt;Eric Hinske&lt;/a&gt; to win the &lt;a href=\"2008%20World%20Series\"&gt;104th Fall Classic&lt;/a&gt;:\nKalas made his final call on April 12, 2009, during the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;Phillies&lt;/a&gt; game against the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Colorado%20Rockies%20season\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt;:\nMiscellany.\nKalas was known for his love of the &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Sinatra\"&gt;Frank Sinatra&lt;/a&gt; song, \"&lt;a href=\"High%20Hopes%20%281959%20song%29\"&gt;High Hopes&lt;/a&gt;\", a melody he sang at numerous events, including the Phillies' championship celebrations in his later years. His most famous singing of \"High Hopes\" came in 1993 when he sang to the team after they clinched the NL East division title. On April 17, 2009, at the first home game after Kalas's death, fans sang along with a video of Harry singing \"High Hopes\" during the seventh-inning stretch, instead of the traditional \"&lt;a href=\"Take%20Me%20Out%20to%20the%20Ball%20Game\"&gt;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&lt;/a&gt;\".\nKalas had sung \"Take Me Out To The Ball Game\" on several occasions during the seventh-inning stretch at &lt;a href=\"Wrigley%20Field\"&gt;Wrigley Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; on several occasions in tribute to &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Caray\"&gt;Harry Caray&lt;/a&gt;, the late voice of the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;, who had led fans in that song at most home games. However, by that time, Kalas, a native of the Chicago area, had become an openly avid Phillies fan, and held the microphone out to the audience to hear them sing \"the Cubbies\" as they replaced their team's name for \"the home team\" in the song's lyrics.\nKalas, due to his stay in Hawaii, was very proficient at pronouncing &lt;a href=\"Polynesia\"&gt;Polynesia&lt;/a&gt;n names. He also liked to slowly enunciate certain players' names, especially those with ethnic names. His personal favorite, &lt;a href=\"Mickey%20Morandini\"&gt;Mickey Morandini&lt;/a&gt;, was pronounced as \"Mi-ckey Mor-an-DI-ni\".\nKalas attributed his leathery voice to his habit of smoking &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20%28cigarette%29\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; cigarettes, and some of the Phillies players lit up Parliaments after Kalas' death as a tribute.\nNFL Films.\nKalas joined &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Films\"&gt;NFL Films&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"narrator\"&gt;narrator&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1975%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1975&lt;/a&gt;. He became its primary voice, following the passing of &lt;a href=\"John%20Facenda\"&gt;John Facenda&lt;/a&gt; in 1984. He provided the narration to the highlights on \"&lt;a href=\"Inside%20the%20NFL\"&gt;Inside the NFL&lt;/a&gt;\" from its inception in &lt;a href=\"1976%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1976&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"2008%20NFL%20season\"&gt;2008 season&lt;/a&gt;. Following Kalas' death, fellow Philadelphia Phillies announcer &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Graham\"&gt;Scott Graham&lt;/a&gt; took over his \"Inside the NFL\" duties.\nOther ventures.\nIn addition to his work with the Phillies and &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Films\"&gt;NFL Films&lt;/a&gt;, Kalas called various sports over the years for the &lt;a href=\"Mutual%20Broadcasting%20System\"&gt;Mutual Broadcasting System&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Radio%20Network\"&gt;CBS Radio&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Westwood%20One%20%281976%E2%80%932011%29\"&gt;Westwood One Radio&lt;/a&gt; (including the NFL, MLB, college basketball, and &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; football). Kalas joined &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Green\"&gt;Dennis Green&lt;/a&gt; to call the &lt;a href=\"1985%20Aloha%20Bowl\"&gt;1985 Aloha Bowl&lt;/a&gt; between Alabama and USC. For many years, he narrated the \"&lt;a href=\"Alcoa\"&gt;Alcoa&lt;/a&gt; Fantastic Finishes\" in-game highlights spots, for use during NFL telecasts. His voice was used for narration of &lt;a href=\"WLVT-TV\"&gt;WLVT-TV&lt;/a&gt;'s documentary on the &lt;a href=\"Lehigh-Lafayette%20Rivalry\"&gt;Lehigh-Lafayette Rivalry&lt;/a&gt;, produced in 2004. Kalas also lent his voice to NFL Network's game telecasts, reading sponsor plugs during commercial breaks. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Summerall\"&gt;Pat Summerall&lt;/a&gt; after his death.\nAlong with Joe Kapp, Kalas called the 1982 Liberty Bowl...the last game of Paul \u201cBear\u201d Bryant's career and his 323rd victory.\nKalas also lent his voice to the commercials for the movie \"&lt;a href=\"Leatherheads\"&gt;Leatherheads&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as commercials for the &lt;a href=\"Campbell%20Soup%20Company\"&gt;Campbell Soup Company&lt;/a&gt; (including Campbell's Chunky Soup), &lt;a href=\"GMC%20Truck\"&gt;GMC Truck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sega%20Genesis\"&gt;Sega Genesis&lt;/a&gt; Sports Games, &lt;a href=\"Coors%20Light\"&gt;Coors Light&lt;/a&gt;, and others.\nKalas provided the recorded voice-over for much of the self-guided tours at the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Mint\"&gt;United States Mint&lt;/a&gt; in Philadelphia and the &lt;a href=\"Gateway%20Arch\"&gt;Gateway Arch&lt;/a&gt; in St. Louis.\nHe also narrated/commentated &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Planet\"&gt;Animal Planet&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Puppy%20Bowl\"&gt;Puppy Bowl&lt;/a&gt;s I-V from 2005 to 2009. &lt;a href=\"Puppy%20Bowl\"&gt;Puppy Bowl&lt;/a&gt; VI was dedicated in his memory.\nHe also made an appearance on the song \"Rain Delay\" by the Philadelphia-based rock group &lt;a href=\"Marah%20%28band%29\"&gt;Marah&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nKalas died of &lt;a href=\"heart%20disease\"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, April 13, 2009, in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; He had collapsed in the &lt;a href=\"Nationals%20Park\"&gt;Nationals Park&lt;/a&gt; press box at approximately 12:30\u00a0pm, several hours before the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Washington%20Nationals%20season\"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt;' home opener against the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;Phillies&lt;/a&gt;. Kalas was rushed to &lt;a href=\"George%20Washington%20University%20Hospital\"&gt;George Washington University Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where he was pronounced dead at 1:20\u00a0pm EDT. \"We lost Harry [today],\" David Montgomery, the team president, said. \"We lost our voice.\" Before the game began, Kalas's death was announced to the crowd, his picture was displayed on the scoreboard, and the stadium observed a minute of silence. The Phillies went on to win the game, 9\u20138. The Phillies saluted Kalas by placing a picture of him in their dugout during the game. Center fielder &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Victorino\"&gt;Shane Victorino&lt;/a&gt; also saluted Kalas after hitting a solo home run by pointing up to the press box where Kalas would have called the game. Phillies fans created a makeshift memorial at the Mike Schmidt statue outside of Citizens Bank Park (at the Third Base Gate) shortly after Kalas's death was announced.\nKalas suffered from &lt;a href=\"atherosclerosis\"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hypertension\"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt; in his later years, but those illnesses did not seem to affect his announcing abilities; he had called the Phillies/&lt;a href=\"2009%20Colorado%20Rockies%20season\"&gt;Rockies&lt;/a&gt; game in &lt;a href=\"Denver%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt; on April 12, the day before his death. Kalas was in his 39th season with the Phillies.\nThough the Phillies were scheduled to visit the &lt;a href=\"White%20House\"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; on April 14 to celebrate their 2008 World Series championship, the visit was postponed so that the day could be set aside to remember Kalas. Their White House visit was pushed back to May 15, coinciding with the Phillies' next scheduled visit to town to play the Nationals.\nOn Friday, April 17, 2009, Kalas's three children, &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Kalas\"&gt;Todd&lt;/a&gt; (himself a former Phillies broadcaster), Brad, and Kane, threw out the ceremonial first pitches before the Phillies first home game after Kalas' death at &lt;a href=\"Citizens%20Bank%20Park\"&gt;Citizens Bank Park&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Schmidt\"&gt;Mike Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Kruk\"&gt;John Kruk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Rollins\"&gt;Jimmy Rollins&lt;/a&gt;, representatives of the three decades of Phillies baseball with Kalas. Following a moment of silence, Kane sang the national anthem.\nThe next day, Kalas became the fourth person to be given the honor of having their body lie in repose inside a major-league baseball stadium \u2014 after &lt;a href=\"Babe%20Ruth\"&gt;Babe Ruth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Buck\"&gt;Jack Buck&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Miller%20Huggins\"&gt;Miller Huggins&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 when his casket was displayed behind home plate and fans were encouraged to pay their respects at Citizens Bank Park. Kalas's casket was passed along by friends, broadcast partners, and every player on the Phillies team roster, before it was placed in a hearse which carried him out of Citizens Bank Park one final time.\nAfter leaving the ballpark, Kalas' body was laid to rest in a private service at Philadelphia's historic &lt;a href=\"Laurel%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Laurel Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. In August 2009, two pairs of seats from Veterans Stadium were installed at his graveside, one pair on each side, facing each other at a 45\u00b0 angle. In the summer of 2010, a headstone was added to the grave, and the fan-made plywood \"P\" was removed as was the bronze plaque with his likeness. The headstone consists of a granite microphone with the letters \"HK\" in the middle and a likeness of Kalas' autograph (which includes the \"HOF 2002\" that Kalas added to his autographs after his receipt of the &lt;a href=\"Ford%20C.%20Frick%20Award\"&gt;Ford C. Frick Award&lt;/a&gt;) at the microphone's base, and that sits on top of a raised base shaped like a home plate. Engraved in the base are the following words:\nHARRY KALAS1936-2009LOVING HUSBANDLOVING FATHERFRIEND TO ALL\nOn September 29, 2010, Kalas's grave was resurfaced with &lt;a href=\"sod\"&gt;sod&lt;/a&gt; that originally came from Citizens Bank Park, which was previously removed for the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;2009 season&lt;/a&gt; when that stadium was re-sodded. The sod had been preserved in live condition for sale to fans at a southern New Jersey sod farm that deals in sod for sports arenas. That farm donated a portion of the former Citizens Bank Park sod when a fan, who volunteers at Laurel Hill Cemetery, contacted that farm regarding using that sod on Kalas's grave in Kalas's memory, as Kalas himself had walked on that sod, and had called the &lt;a href=\"2008%20World%20Series\"&gt;2008 World Series&lt;/a&gt; victory which had come on that very grass.\nDuring the winter of 2011\u20132012, a baseball quote by &lt;a href=\"A.%20Bartlett%20Giamatti\"&gt;A. Bartlett Giamatti&lt;/a&gt; was added to the top of the home plate-shaped plinth of the tombstone. It reads, \nHonors.\nNicknamed \"Harry the K\" by Phillies pitcher &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Christenson\"&gt;Larry Christenson&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-1970s, a nickname quickly adopted by Phillies fans, Kalas received the &lt;a href=\"Ford%20C.%20Frick%20Award\"&gt;Ford C. Frick Award&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;National Baseball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. In 2004, he was named Person of the Year by the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia. That year, he was also inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;, as a member of the charter class (21 members). He was named Pennsylvania Sportscaster of the Year 18 times.\nKalas also helped announce the ceremonial closing of &lt;a href=\"Veterans%20Stadium\"&gt;Veterans Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on September 28, 2003, and was the master of ceremonies at the ceremonial opening of &lt;a href=\"Citizens%20Bank%20Park\"&gt;Citizens Bank Park&lt;/a&gt; in 2004.\nAt Citizens Bank Park, the restaurant built into the base of the main scoreboard is named \"Harry the K's\" in Kalas's honor. After Kalas's death, the Phillies' TV-broadcast booth was renamed \"The Harry Kalas Broadcast Booth\". It is directly next to the radio-broadcast booth, which is named \"The Richie 'Whitey' Ashburn Broadcast Booth\".\nWhen Kalas died on April 13, 2009, fans created an impromptu memorial tribute to him at the base of the statue of Mike Schmidt at the Third Base Gate of Citizens Bank Park.\nThe Phillies honored Kalas for the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;2009 season&lt;/a&gt; with a round, black \"HK\" patch over the heart on all player, coach, and manager jerseys. Additionally, a billboard featuring a microphone, his initials and lifespan (\"HK 1936\u20132009\") was displayed on the wall in left-center field during the 2009 season.\nImmediately after the Phillies clinched the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20Eastern%20Division\"&gt;National League Eastern Division&lt;/a&gt;, the players all went to the billboard, lit cigars and poured beer and champagne on the billboard as a symbolic way of including Kalas in the celebration, as Kalas had participated in all of the Phillies' victory celebrations during his tenure in Philadelphia, including both World Series wins, having ridden in both of the Phillies World Series parades.\nThe Phillies players, led by &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Victorino\"&gt;Shane Victorino&lt;/a&gt;, hung Kalas' signature baby-blue blazer and white loafers in the dugout for every game.\nFollowing Kalas' death, the Phillies began playing a video of Kalas singing the first verse of \"&lt;a href=\"High%20Hopes%20%281959%20song%29\"&gt;High Hopes&lt;/a&gt;\" at Citizens Bank Park after every Phillies win, as well as playing Kalas's famous \"This ball is outta here!\" call at Citizens Bank Park after every Phillies home run.\nThe Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Kalas into their Hall of fame in 2000 and named him their Person of the Year in 2004.\nIn 2009, Kalas was that year's inductee into the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Baseball%20Wall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn June 2009, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Radio%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;National Radio Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; announced that Kalas would be posthumously inducted into its Hall of Fame. Thirteen other sportscasters were previously inducted into the Hall of Fame.\nPhillies fan Antonio Jose initiated an online petition seeking support for a statue of Kalas to be erected outside the Phillies' ballpark. As of May 2010, there were 24,000 signatories. Sculptor &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20Nowlan\"&gt;Lawrence Nowlan&lt;/a&gt; designed a model for the statue. In September 2010, a story that aired on the \"10 Show\" on &lt;a href=\"WCAU-TV\"&gt;WCAU-TV&lt;/a&gt; stated that the full-size clay model for the statue was nearly complete, and was ready to have a mold of it cast so the actual bronze statue can be cast.\nOn Tuesday, August 16, 2011, the Nowlan sculpture, a bronze statue (which depicts Kalas standing cross-legged on a &lt;a href=\"home%20plate\"&gt;home plate&lt;/a&gt;, holding a &lt;a href=\"microphone\"&gt;microphone&lt;/a&gt; in his right hand, which also holds a &lt;a href=\"baseball%20bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt; that he was leaning upon) was unveiled in the Ashburn Alley outfield concourse at Citizens Bank Park between Harry the K's Restaurant and the statue of Richie Ashburn prior to that evening's game versus the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt;. This unveiling was postponed from the previous Sunday, when the statue was scheduled to be unveiled prior to the game versus the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Nationals\"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt;, which had been rained out.\nThe 2010 &lt;a href=\"Mummers%20Parade\"&gt;Mummers Parade&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"New%20Year%27s%20Day\"&gt;New Year's Day&lt;/a&gt; featured the Happy Tappers Comics dressed as Phillies players with the \"HK\" patch on the Phillies jerseys to pay tribute to Kalas and their theme was \"Harry K's Field of Dreams.\""
