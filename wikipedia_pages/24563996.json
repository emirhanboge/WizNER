He was the torpedo officer on the German U-boat, the , who saw to the preparation and firing of the &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; that sank the on 7 May 1915.

After the torpedo was fired, he was called to the &lt;a href=\"periscope\"&gt;periscope&lt;/a&gt;. He said the explosion which he saw was far more severe than could normally have been expected.
