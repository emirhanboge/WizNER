    "text": "Young Talent Time was an Australian television variety program produced by Lewis-Young Productions and screened on &lt;a href=\"Network%20Ten\"&gt;Network Ten&lt;/a&gt;. The original series ran from 1971 until 1988 and was hosted by singer-songwriter and record producer &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Young\"&gt;Johnny Young&lt;/a&gt; for its entire run. The show was briefly revived by Network Ten in 2012 and was hosted by singer and actor &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Mills\"&gt;Rob Mills&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe series featured a core group of young performers, in the vein of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mickey%20Mouse%20Club\"&gt;The Mickey Mouse Club&lt;/a&gt;\", and a weekly junior talent quest. The regular cast known as \"The Young Talent Team\" performed popular classic songs along with the top hit songs of the day. The original program launched the careers of a number of Australian performers including &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Boyden%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Sally Boyden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Redfern\"&gt;Jamie Redfern&lt;/a&gt;, Vikki Broughton, &lt;a href=\"Debra%20Byrne\"&gt;Debra Byrne&lt;/a&gt; (billed then as Debbie), &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Arena\"&gt;Tina Arena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dannii%20Minogue\"&gt;Dannii Minogue&lt;/a&gt; and spawned numerous hit singles, fifteen Young Talent Time albums, a film, as well as merchandise including swap cards, boardgames, toys, and mugs. The program won numerous &lt;a href=\"Logie%20Award\"&gt;Logie Award&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"Young Talent Time\" (1971\u20131988).\nProduction details.\n\"Young Talent Time\" was produced as a joint venture by \"Lewis-Young Productions\" (the production partnership between host &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Young\"&gt;Johnny Young&lt;/a&gt; and his friend and colleague Kevin Lewis, one of the directors of &lt;a href=\"Festival%20Records\"&gt;Festival Records&lt;/a&gt;) and was taped mainly at the studios of &lt;a href=\"ATV-10\"&gt;ATV-10&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nunawading\"&gt;Nunawading&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; although occasional shows were taped at the &lt;a href=\"TEN-10\"&gt;TEN-10&lt;/a&gt; studios in &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; or on location.\nMany of the episodes from the early- to mid-1970s no longer exist as the tapes were &lt;a href=\"Wiping%20%28magnetic%20tape%29\"&gt;wiped&lt;/a&gt; for re-use, being the official &lt;a href=\"Network%20Ten\"&gt;Network Ten&lt;/a&gt; policy at the time. Some later episodes from the series were repeated by &lt;a href=\"pay%20TV\"&gt;pay TV&lt;/a&gt; broadcaster &lt;a href=\"Foxtel\"&gt;Foxtel&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1990s.\nOn average, 44 episodes were produced per year for 18 years. The episodes were broadcast in black and white from April 1971 to April 1975, thereafter in colour. The final episode aired on 23 December 1988.\n\"Caravan Holiday\".\nIn the Christmas break between the first and second seasons of \"Young Talent Time\", Johnny Young and the Young Talent Team shot a 22-minute colour film. (At the time, \"Young Talent Time\" still screened in &lt;a href=\"black%20and%20white%20television\"&gt;black and white&lt;/a&gt; on Australian television.) Sponsored by the Caravan Trade &amp; Industries Association \"Caravan Holiday\" was completed by early 1972 and released in cinemas across Australia as a supporting feature to &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Bogdanovich\"&gt;Peter Bogdanovich&lt;/a&gt;'s hugely popular US comedy picture \"&lt;a href=\"What%27s%20Up%2C%20Doc%3F%20%281972%20film%29\"&gt;What's Up, Doc?&lt;/a&gt;\" which starred &lt;a href=\"Barbra%20Streisand\"&gt;Barbra Streisand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20O%27Neal\"&gt;Ryan O'Neal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cast featured the then-current line-up of the Young Talent Team (Jamie Redfern, Rod Kirkham, Greg Mills, Philip Gould, Julie Ryles, Debbie Byrne, Vikki Broughton and Jane Scali) prior to Redfern's departure to tour the US with &lt;a href=\"Liberace\"&gt;Liberace&lt;/a&gt;. Despite not appearing in the film, new team member Trevor Hindmarch turned up to the premiere, as seen in the documentary \"Young Talent Time Tells All\".\nIt featured actor/comedian Buster Fiddess (as Mr Crawley) and Addie Black, and guest appearances by Johnny Young (in multiple cameos as a service station attendant, farmer, caravan site manager and speedboat lake), &lt;a href=\"Evie%20Hayes\"&gt;Evie Hayes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Farnham\"&gt;John Farnham&lt;/a&gt; (then known as Johnny Farnham) as himself. Fiddess died just a few days after he finished filming his scenes. There was also a film clip made for the Young Talent Team's version of &lt;a href=\"The%20Cowsills\"&gt;The Cowsills&lt;/a&gt;' hit song \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Rain%2C%20The%20Park%20and%20Other%20Things\"&gt;The Rain, The Park and Other Things&lt;/a&gt;\", shot in Melbourne's &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Royal Botanic Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, but despite not appearing on the actual recording, being recorded prior to their recruitment, Mills and Ryles appeared in the clip.\nIt screened on television just once, on Christmas Eve 1972. It was then unseen for three decades until a restored version was featured as a bonus extra on the 2002 DVD \"Young Talent Time: The Collection\" (Universal Pictures - 2002).\nIn the opening credit sequence, Jane Scali's surname is misspelt as Scarli.\n\"Alumni\".\nOver the original run of the show, from 1971 to 1988, there were a total of 40 cast members.\nMembers of the cast who found continued success after leaving the series and continue working as performers include &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Arena\"&gt;Tina Arena&lt;/a&gt;, Vikki Broughton, &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Scali\"&gt;Jane Scali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Redfern\"&gt;Jamie Redfern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dannii%20Minogue\"&gt;Dannii Minogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Knowles\"&gt;Karen Knowles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Boyden%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Sally Boyden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Debra%20Byrne\"&gt;Debra Byrne&lt;/a&gt; and John Bowles.\nThe show had a policy that when team members reached 16 years of age, they had to leave the series and move on, but this rule would subsequently be stretched and broken.\nConcerts and live appearances.\nOver the 18 years of the original show, Johnny Young and the various cast members made numerous live appearances all over Australia, performing full concerts or short publicity appearances at various venues.\nIn 1973, Young, the cast and &lt;a href=\"Denis%20Walter\"&gt;Denis Walter&lt;/a&gt; supported &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Redfern\"&gt;Jamie Redfern&lt;/a&gt; in a series of live concerts. \"The Jamie Redfern Show\" sold out a number of shows at Melbourne's &lt;a href=\"Festival%20Hall%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Festival Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1987, an unanticipated audience turnout of over 4,000 people caused trouble at a concert at the &lt;a href=\"Westfield%20Parramatta\"&gt;Westfield Shopping Centre, Parramatta&lt;/a&gt;. Some fans were crushed in the crowd and the concert was cancelled. Joey Dee had to be treated for a knee injury and Courtney Compagnino had to be treated for shock.\nIn 1988, over 12,000 people attended an outdoor concert held in Brisbane at the &lt;a href=\"1988%20World%20Expo\"&gt;1988 World Expo&lt;/a&gt;, which was broadcast on television the following week.\nAt the end of 1988, Young and the cast performed a series of concerts. The final concert was held at the Melbourne Tennis Centre on 23 December, the same night on which the last episode of \"Young Talent Time\" aired on Network Ten.\nLuna Park incident.\nIn the early 1970s the cast performed at &lt;a href=\"Luna%20Park%20Sydney\"&gt;Luna Park Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the large crowd in attendance, they were unable to leave. Park management offered to stop the scenic railway so that the cast could exit through the tunnel. According to Greg Mills, the train driver was not told, and the train did not stop. The cast narrowly avoided death by pressing themselves against the wall of the tunnel. If not for Brad Boyden, &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Boyden%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Sally Boyden&lt;/a&gt;'s Father, neither of the team would have known that the roller coaster train was even approaching. Trevor Hindmarch came the closest to death or injury as his jacket was almost caught on the speeding vehicle as it passed. Fortunately Trevor lost only a button.\nFinal years.\nIn 1988, an episode of Young Talent Time was shot in the United States. The two-hour special, \"Young Talent Time at Universal Studios\", aired on 13 August 1988.\nIn its final years, Young Talent Time began to struggle for ratings, particularly following the decision of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Network\"&gt;Nine Network&lt;/a&gt; to move its popular early morning variety show \"&lt;a href=\"Hey%20Hey%20It%27s%20Saturday\"&gt;Hey Hey It's Saturday&lt;/a&gt;\" to the 6:30 pm slot in 1985, which put it in direct competition to Young Talent Time.\nAfter four years of dwindling ratings, in October 1988 Network Ten finally decided to move \"YTT\" to Friday nights at 7.30 pm, but the change did not help. The show was cancelled three months later. The general manager of Channel 10 Melbourne, Renny Cunnack, announced on 25 January 1989 that \"Young Talent Time\" would \"not be resuming production in 1989\". Cunnack himself was dismissed as General Manager three months later. The following day on Australia Day in 1989, the Young Talent Time cast performed a concert at the &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Myer%20Music%20Bowl\"&gt;Sidney Myer Music Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in Melbourne.\nNear the end of 1988, Johnny Young had invested a large amount of money in building his own TV studio complex in &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of producing the show himself and leasing it to Channel 10 but the termination of the show ended this plan and he was forced to sell his family home to finance his debts.\nNetwork Ten continued airing compilation episodes in early 1989, initially as \"The Best of Young Talent Time\" at 7.30 on Friday nights, then as \"Young Talent Time Favorites\" at 11.00 on Saturday mornings. The last of these aired in Melbourne on Saturday 1 April 1989.\nOn September 26th 2021, Channel 10 aired a special anniversary edition of Young Talent Time. It marked the show's 50th anniversary.\n\"The New Generation\" (1988).\nIn 1988 Johnny Young launched an American version of the show re-titled \"The New Generation\".\nProduced in Australia, it starred the current senior members of the former Young Talent Time cast: Dannii Minogue, Vince Del Tito, Natalie Miller, Lorena Novoa, Beven Addinsall; and a new member, Keith Williams, from Los Angeles. The show also featured regular appearances from the younger members of the former cast, who were billed as \"The Young Generation\": Jamie Churchill, Johnnie Nuich, Joey Dee, Courtney Compagnino, Juanita Coco and Rikki Arnot.\n\"The New Generation\" was hosted by American &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Young%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Michael Young&lt;/a&gt;, the host of the &lt;a href=\"Emmy%20Award\"&gt;Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt; winning \"&lt;a href=\"Kids%20Are%20People%20Too\"&gt;Kids Are People Too&lt;/a&gt;\". Thirteen 30-minute episodes were produced by Johnny Young's Television House and Fries Entertainment and screened on &lt;a href=\"Freeform%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;CBN Cable Network/The CBN Family Channel&lt;/a&gt; (now Freeform) in the US.\n\"Young Talent Time\" (1990).\nIn 1990 Johnny Young self-funded and produced a one-off direct-to-video special titled \"Young Talent Time Now - 1990\". It featured the final six members of the cast (Jamie Churchill, Johnnie Nuich, Joey Dee, Courtney Compagnino, Juanita Coco, and Rikki Arnot) and former cast member Beven Addinsall.\n\"Young Talent Time\" (2012).\n&lt;a href=\"Network%20Ten\"&gt;Network Ten&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Granada%20Australia\"&gt;Granada Australia&lt;/a&gt; - in conjunction with Johnny Young and Johnny Young Music - were the producers of a revival of \"Young Talent Time\". Taped before a live studio audience at Fox Studios in Sydney, the 15-episode series debuted on Network Ten across Australia at 6.30 pm on Sunday 22 January 2012.\nHosted by former \"&lt;a href=\"Australian%20Idol%202003\"&gt;Australian Idol 2003&lt;/a&gt;\" contestant &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Mills\"&gt;Rob Mills&lt;/a&gt;, the 2012 revival featured a regular Young Talent Team (of 10 members) performing a couple of group numbers each week, with one team member featuring in a solo spot each episode to showcase their individual talents. Starting from Episode 10, duets were sung instead of solos as each team member had performed a solo.\nEach weekly episode featured three or four young contestants (or acts) under the age of 16. These solo performers, duos, groups, etc., included singers, dancers (ballet, hip hop, tap, jazz, etc.), musicians, sight acts, illusionists, comedians and so on. The winning contestant (or act) each week received $5,000 from NAB (National Australia Bank) and the Grand Final winner received $100,000.\nThe show's two judges/mentors were the original show's longest-serving Young Talent Team member &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Arena\"&gt;Tina Arena&lt;/a&gt; (who appeared from 1977 to 1983 \u2013 six years 6 Months), and Filipino-American choreographer &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Klapow\"&gt;Charles Klapow&lt;/a&gt;, one of the winners of the &lt;a href=\"Emmy%20Award\"&gt;Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt; for 'Outstanding Choreography' for \"&lt;a href=\"High%20School%20Musical%202\"&gt;High School Musical 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Better known as 'Chucky' Klapow, he also helped choreograph the films \"&lt;a href=\"Cheetah%20Girls%202\"&gt;Cheetah Girls 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20School%20Musical\"&gt;High School Musical&lt;/a&gt; and \" as well as appearing in all three \"&lt;a href=\"High%20School%20Musical\"&gt;High School Musical&lt;/a&gt;\" movies as a dancer. He has choreographed for &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Jagger\"&gt;Mick Jagger&lt;/a&gt; and dances alongside &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Jackson\"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt; in the film \"&lt;a href=\"Michael%20Jackson%27s%20This%20Is%20It\"&gt;Michael Jackson's This Is It&lt;/a&gt;\". Klapow had previously been a judge on UK talent show \"&lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Stop%20Believing%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Don't Stop Believing&lt;/a&gt;\". TV Personality &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Dickson%20%28TV%20personality%29\"&gt;Ian Dickson&lt;/a&gt; filled in as judge while &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Arena\"&gt;Tina Arena&lt;/a&gt; was ill for one episode. From the beginning of the finals competition he served as a full-time judge.\nWhile the judges decided the winning contestant (or act) of each weekly episode, viewers could vote online for any of the weekly runners-up to become a 'wild-card' entrant, giving them a second chance of making it into the finals. On 20 March, it was announced that \"YTT\" would move to Fridays at 7:30 to 8:30, the current time slot of Glee. It is believed \"YTT\" was moved because of poor ratings on Sunday night resulting in the much more popular program \"The Biggest Loser\" taking the 6:30 to 7:30 timeslot. The YTT team then commenced a tour having shows in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. The Grand Final episode was aired on 4 May. The talent quest was won by first heat entrants and wildcard winners Lil' Banditz Krew. The all-boys Hip Hop troupe toured with the YTT team and Rob Mills in June and July 2012, visiting various Sydney venues as well as Melbourne and Canberra.\n\"YTT\" was not renewed for a 2013 season because of poor ratings. However, such team members as Aydan Calafiore and Adrien Nookadu went on to have music careers and Georgia-May Davis worked with &lt;a href=\"Disney%20Channel%20Australia\"&gt;Disney Channel Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Lyndall Wennekes later starred on \"The Voice\" in 2014, Adrien Nookadu on \"The X Factor\" in 2014. Aydan Calafiore appeared on \"Australia's Got Talent\" in 2013 and auditioned for the 2017 and 2018 seasons of The Voice, being unable to turn a chair in 2017 but turning all four chairs in 2018. Aydan joined Joe Jonas' and ultimately placed 4th place on \"The Voice\", which resulted in him releasing his own music as well as being on &lt;a href=\"Eurovision%20-%20Australia%20Decides\"&gt;Eurovision - Australia Decides&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.\nDiscography and videography.\nDVDs.\nA one-hour prime-time television documentary \"Young Talent Time Tells All\" aired on Network Ten on 29 October 2001. Produced and directed by former YTT cast member John Bowles, it was a tremendous ratings success celebrating the show's 30th anniversary. Bowles interviewed over thirty of the original cast members for the programme. Archive footage, including clips thought to have been lost, were interspersed with the YTT kids speaking about their experiences on and off-air.\nA small reunion of \"YTT\" cast and crew members (including &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Arena\"&gt;Tina Arena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dannii%20Minogue\"&gt;Dannii Minogue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Young\"&gt;Johnny Young&lt;/a&gt;) was held in Melbourne in October 2003 to launch the release of an extended version of the \"Young Talent Time Tells All\" documentary on DVD (through &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Pictures\"&gt;Universal Pictures&lt;/a&gt;). The original documentary TV Special was extended, and bonus features and rare footage, not seen in the television version, were added. It was titled \"Young Talent Time: The Collection\".\nBonus features on the DVD include a restored version of the 1972 short film \"Caravan Holiday\" featuring Johnny Young and the Young Talent Team; full biographies of all 40 Team Members and Johnny Young; &lt;a href=\"Nicole%20Kidman\"&gt;Nicole Kidman&lt;/a&gt;'s appearance as a guest on the show to promote her 1983 film &lt;a href=\"BMX%20Bandits%20%28film%29\"&gt;\"BMX Bandits\"&lt;/a&gt;; assorted television commercials featuring members of the team; footage of some of the Team when they appeared as contestants on the show; and the full-length clip of sisters &lt;a href=\"Dannii%20Minogue\"&gt;Dannii Minogue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kylie%20Minogue\"&gt;Kylie Minogue&lt;/a&gt; performing the song \"Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves\".\nRare footage includes a nine-year-old Jamie Redfern (pre-\"Young Talent Time\") appearing with &lt;a href=\"Happy%20Hammond\"&gt;Happy Hammond&lt;/a&gt; on a Channel Seven test broadcast of colour television in 1968, seven years before Australian television actually began broadcasting in colour."
