    "text": "Ivan IV Vasilyevich (; 25 August 1530 \u2013 ), commonly known in &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; as Ivan the Terrible (from , , &lt;a href=\"Literal%20translation\"&gt;lit&lt;/a&gt;. \"Ivan the Formidable\" or \"Ivan the Fearsome\", , &lt;a href=\"monastic%20name\"&gt;monastic name&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Jonah\"&gt;Jonah&lt;/a&gt;), was the &lt;a href=\"grand%20prince%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;grand prince of Moscow&lt;/a&gt; from 1533 to 1547 and the first Moscow ruler who declared himself &lt;a href=\"Tsardom%20of%20Russia\"&gt;tsar of all Russia&lt;/a&gt; from 1547 to 1584.\nIvan was the first Moscow ruler born after its independence. The son of &lt;a href=\"Vasili%20III\"&gt;Vasili III&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rurikid\"&gt;Rurikid&lt;/a&gt; ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, he was appointed grand prince when he was three years old after his father's death. A group of reformers known as the \"Chosen Council\" united around the young Ivan, declaring him &lt;a href=\"tsar\"&gt;tsar&lt;/a&gt; (emperor) of &lt;a href=\"Kievan%20Rus%27\"&gt;All Rus'&lt;/a&gt; in 1547 at the age of 16 and establishing the &lt;a href=\"Tsardom%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Tsardom of Russia&lt;/a&gt; with Moscow as the predominant state. Ivan's reign was characterised by Russia's transformation from a &lt;a href=\"medieval\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; state to an &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; under the tsar but at an immense cost to its people and its broader, long-term economy.\nDuring his youth, there was a conquest of the khanates of &lt;a href=\"Khanate%20of%20Kazan\"&gt;Kazan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khanate%20of%20Astrakhan\"&gt;Astrakhan&lt;/a&gt;. After he had consolidated his power, Ivan got rid of the advisers from the \"Chosen Council\" and triggered the &lt;a href=\"Livonian%20War\"&gt;Livonian War&lt;/a&gt;, which ravaged Russia and resulted in the loss of &lt;a href=\"Livonia\"&gt;Livonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ingria\"&gt;Ingria&lt;/a&gt; but allowed him to establish greater &lt;a href=\"autocratic\"&gt;autocratic&lt;/a&gt; control over &lt;a href=\"Russia%27s%20nobility\"&gt;Russia's nobility&lt;/a&gt;, which he violently purged with the \"&lt;a href=\"Oprichnina\"&gt;Oprichnina&lt;/a&gt;\". The later years of Ivan's reign were also marked by the &lt;a href=\"Massacre%20of%20Novgorod\"&gt;Massacre of Novgorod&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Crimean%20Wars%23Russo%E2%80%93Crimean%20War%20%281570%E2%80%931572%29\"&gt;burning of Moscow by Tatars&lt;/a&gt;.\nContemporary sources present disparate accounts of Ivan's complex personality. He was described as intelligent and devout but also prone to &lt;a href=\"paranoia\"&gt;paranoia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rage%20%28emotion%29\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt;, and episodic outbreaks of &lt;a href=\"mental%20instability\"&gt;mental instability&lt;/a&gt; that increased with age. In one fit of anger, he murdered his eldest son and heir, &lt;a href=\"Tsarevich%20Ivan%20Ivanovich%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Ivan Ivanovich&lt;/a&gt;, and he might also have caused the miscarriage of the latter's unborn child. This left his younger son, the politically ineffectual &lt;a href=\"Feodor%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Feodor Ivanovich&lt;/a&gt;, to inherit the throne, a man whose rule and subsequent childless death directly led to the end of the Rurikid dynasty and the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Time%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Time of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;.\nNickname.\nThe English word \"terrible\" is usually used to translate the Russian word \"\u0413\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439\" in Ivan's nickname, but that is a somewhat-archaic translation. The Russian word \"\u0413\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439\" reflects the older English usage of \"terrible\" as in \"inspiring fear or terror; dangerous; powerful; formidable\". It does not convey the more modern connotations of English \"terrible\" such as \"defective\" or \"evil\". &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Dal\"&gt;Vladimir Dal&lt;/a&gt; defines \"grozny\" specifically in archaic usage and as an epithet for tsars: \"courageous, magnificent, magisterial and keeping enemies in fear, but people in obedience\". Other translations have also been suggested by modern scholars, including 'formidable'.\nEarly life.\nIvan was the first son of &lt;a href=\"Vasili%20III%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Vasili III&lt;/a&gt; and his second wife, &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Glinskaya\"&gt;Elena Glinskaya&lt;/a&gt;. Vasili's &lt;a href=\"Sophia%20Palaiologina\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"Greeks\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; princess and member of the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Palaiologos\"&gt;Palaiologos family&lt;/a&gt;. She was a daughter of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Palaiologos\"&gt;Thomas Palaiologos&lt;/a&gt;, the younger brother of the last &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Emperor\"&gt;Byzantine Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20XI%20Palaiologos\"&gt;Constantine XI Palaiologos&lt;/a&gt; (). Elena's &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Jak%C5%A1i%C4%87\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; was a Serbian princess and her father's family, the Glinski clan (nobles based in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;), claimed descent both from Orthodox &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20nobles\"&gt;Hungarian nobles&lt;/a&gt; and the Mongol ruler &lt;a href=\"Mamai\"&gt;Mamai&lt;/a&gt; (1335\u20131380.) Born on August 25, he received the name Ivan in honor of St. John the Baptist, the day of the Beheading of which falls on August 29. In some texts of that era, it is also occasionally mentioned with the names Titus and Smaragd, in accordance with the tradition of polyonyms among the Rurikovich. Baptized in the Trinity-Sergius Monastery by Abbot Joasaph (Skripitsyn), two elders of the Joseph-Volotsk monastery were elected as recipients\u2014the monk Cassian Bossoy and the hegumen Daniel. Tradition says that in honor of the birth of Ivan, the Church of the Ascension was built in Kolomenskoye.\nWhen Ivan was three years old, his father died from an abscess and inflammation on his leg that developed into &lt;a href=\"blood%20poisoning\"&gt;blood poisoning&lt;/a&gt;. The closest contenders to the throne, except for the young Ivan, were the younger brothers of Vasily. Of the six sons of Ivan III, only two remained: Prince Andrey Staritsky and Prince Dmitrovsky Yuri. Ivan was proclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prince%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Grand Prince of Moscow&lt;/a&gt; at the request of his father. His mother &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Glinskaya\"&gt;Elena Glinskaya&lt;/a&gt; initially acted as regent, but she died in 1538 when Ivan was only eight years old; many believe that she was poisoned. The regency then alternated between several feuding &lt;a href=\"boyar\"&gt;boyar&lt;/a&gt; families that fought for control. According to his own letters, Ivan, along with his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Yuri%20Vasilevich%20%28son%20of%20Vasili%20IIl%29\"&gt;Yuri&lt;/a&gt;, often felt neglected and offended by the mighty boyars from the &lt;a href=\"Shuisky\"&gt;Shuisky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belsky%20family%20%28Gediminid%29\"&gt;Belsky&lt;/a&gt; families. In a letter to Prince &lt;a href=\"Andrey%20Kurbsky\"&gt;Kurbski&lt;/a&gt; Ivan remembered, \"My brother Iurii, of blessed memory, and me they brought up like vagrants and children of the poorest. What have I suffered for want of garments and food!\" That account has been challenged by the historian Edward Keenan, who doubts the authenticity of the source in which the quotations are found.\nOn 16 January 1547, at 16, Ivan was crowned at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Dormition\"&gt;Cathedral of the Dormition&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Kremlin\"&gt;Moscow Kremlin&lt;/a&gt;. The Metropolitan placed on Ivan the signs of royal dignity: the &lt;a href=\"True%20cross\"&gt;Cross of the Life-Giving Tree&lt;/a&gt;, barmas, and the &lt;a href=\"Monomakh%27s%20Cap\"&gt;cap of Monomakh&lt;/a&gt;; Ivan Vasilievich was anointed with myrrh, and then the metropolitan &lt;a href=\"Blessing\"&gt;blessed the&lt;/a&gt; tsar. He was the first to be crowned as \"Tsar of All the Russias\", partly imitating his grandfather, &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20III%20the%20Great\"&gt;Ivan III the Great&lt;/a&gt;, who had claimed the title of Grand Prince of all Rus'. Until then, rulers of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Muscovy&lt;/a&gt; were crowned as Grand Princes, but &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20III%20the%20Great\"&gt;Ivan III the Great&lt;/a&gt; had styled himself \"&lt;a href=\"tsar\"&gt;tsar&lt;/a&gt;\" in his correspondence. Two weeks after his coronation, Ivan married his first wife, &lt;a href=\"Anastasia%20Romanovna\"&gt;Anastasia Romanovna&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Romanov%20family\"&gt;Romanov family&lt;/a&gt;, who became the first Russian &lt;a href=\"tsaritsa\"&gt;tsaritsa&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy being crowned tsar, Ivan was sending a message to the world and to Russia that he was now the only supreme ruler of the country, and his will was not to be questioned. \"The new title symbolized an assumption of powers equivalent and parallel to those held by former Byzantine Emperor and the Tatar Khan, both known in Russian sources as Tsar. The political effect was to elevate Ivan's position\". The new title not only secured the throne but also granted Ivan a new dimension of power that was intimately tied to religion. He was now a \"divine\" leader appointed to enact God's will, as \"church texts described Old Testament kings as 'Tsars' and Christ as the Heavenly Tsar\". The newly appointed title was then passed on from generation to generation, and \"succeeding Muscovite rulers... benefited from the divine nature of the power of the Russian monarch... crystallized during Ivan's reign\".\nDomestic policy.\nDespite calamities triggered by the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20of%20Moscow%20%281547%29\"&gt;Great Fire of 1547&lt;/a&gt;, the early part of Ivan's reign was one of peaceful reforms and modernization. Ivan revised the law code, creating the &lt;a href=\"Sudebnik%20of%201550\"&gt;Sudebnik of 1550&lt;/a&gt;, founded a &lt;a href=\"standing%20army\"&gt;standing army&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"streltsy\"&gt;streltsy&lt;/a&gt;), established the &lt;a href=\"Zemsky%20Sobor\"&gt;Zemsky Sobor&lt;/a&gt; (the first Russian parliament of feudal estates) and the council of the nobles (known as the Chosen Council) and confirmed the position of the Church with the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Hundred%20Chapters\"&gt;Council of the Hundred Chapters&lt;/a&gt; (\"Stoglavy Synod\"), which unified the rituals and ecclesiastical regulations of the whole country. He introduced local self-government to rural regions, mainly in northeastern Russia, populated by the state peasantry.\nIvan ordered in 1553 the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Print%20Yard\"&gt;Moscow Print Yard&lt;/a&gt;, and the first &lt;a href=\"printing%20press\"&gt;printing press&lt;/a&gt; was introduced to Russia. Several religious books in Russian were printed during the 1550s and 1560s. The new technology provoked discontent among traditional scribes, which led to the Print Yard being burned in an arson attack. The first Russian printers, &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Fedorov%20%28printer%29\"&gt;Ivan Fedorov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pyotr%20Mstislavets\"&gt;Pyotr Mstislavets&lt;/a&gt;, were forced to flee from Moscow to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, the printing of books resumed from 1568 onwards, with Andronik Timofeevich Nevezha and his son Ivan now heading the Print Yard.\nIvan had &lt;a href=\"St.%20Basil%27s%20Cathedral\"&gt;St. Basil's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; constructed in Moscow to commemorate the seizure of &lt;a href=\"Kazan\"&gt;Kazan&lt;/a&gt;. There is a legend that he was so impressed with the structure that he had the architect, &lt;a href=\"Postnik%20Yakovlev\"&gt;Postnik Yakovlev&lt;/a&gt;, blinded so that he could never design anything as beautiful again. However, Postnik Yakovlev really went on to design more churches for Ivan and the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Kazan%20Kremlin\"&gt;Kazan Kremlin&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1560s as well as the chapel over St. Basil's grave, which was added to St. Basil's Cathedral in 1588, several years after Ivan's death. Although more than one architect was associated with that name, it is believed that the principal architect is the same person.\nOther events of the period include the introduction of the first laws restricting the mobility of the peasants, which would eventually lead to &lt;a href=\"serfdom\"&gt;serfdom&lt;/a&gt; and were instituted during the rule of the future Tsar &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Godunov\"&gt;Boris Godunov&lt;/a&gt; in 1597. (See also &lt;a href=\"Serfdom%20in%20Russia\"&gt;Serfdom in Russia&lt;/a&gt;.)\nOprichnina.\nThe 1560s brought to Russia hardships that led to a dramatic change of Ivan's policies. Russia was devastated by a combination of drought, famine, unsuccessful wars against the &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tatar%20invasions\"&gt;Tatar invasions&lt;/a&gt;, and the sea-trading blockade carried out by the Swedes, the Poles, and the &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20League\"&gt;Hanseatic League&lt;/a&gt;. His first wife, &lt;a href=\"Anastasia%20Romanovna\"&gt;Anastasia Romanovna&lt;/a&gt;, died in 1560, which was suspected to be a poisoning. The personal tragedy deeply hurt Ivan and is thought to have affected his personality, if not his mental health. At the same time, one of Ivan's advisors, Prince &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Kurbsky\"&gt;Andrei Kurbsky&lt;/a&gt;, defected to the Lithuanians, took command of the Lithuanian troops and devastated the Russian region of &lt;a href=\"Velikiye%20Luki\"&gt;Velikiye Luki&lt;/a&gt;. That series of treasons made Ivan paranoically suspicious of nobility.\nOn 3 December 1564, Ivan departed Moscow for &lt;a href=\"Aleksandrova%20Sloboda\"&gt;Aleksandrova Sloboda&lt;/a&gt;, where he sent two letters in which he announced his &lt;a href=\"abdication\"&gt;abdication&lt;/a&gt; because of the alleged embezzlement and treason of the aristocracy and the clergy. The &lt;a href=\"boyar\"&gt;boyar&lt;/a&gt; court was unable to rule in Ivan's absence and feared the wrath of the Muscovite citizens. A boyar envoy departed for Aleksandrova Sloboda to beg Ivan to return to the throne. Ivan agreed to return on condition of being granted absolute power. He demanded the right to condemn and execute traitors and confiscate their estates without interference from the boyar council or church. Ivan decreed the creation of the &lt;a href=\"oprichnina\"&gt;oprichnina&lt;/a&gt;.\nThat was a separate territory within the borders of Russia, mostly in the territory of the former &lt;a href=\"Novgorod%20Republic\"&gt;Novgorod Republic&lt;/a&gt; in the north. Ivan held exclusive power over the territory. The Boyar Council ruled the zemshchina ('land'), the second division of the state. Ivan also recruited a personal guard known as the &lt;a href=\"Oprichniki\"&gt;Oprichniki&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, it numbered 1000. The oprichniki were headed by &lt;a href=\"Malyuta%20Skuratov\"&gt;Malyuta Skuratov&lt;/a&gt;. One known oprichnik was the German adventurer &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20von%20Staden%20%28author%29\"&gt;Heinrich von Staden&lt;/a&gt;. The oprichniki enjoyed social and economic privileges under the oprichnina. They owed their allegiance and status to Ivan, not heredity or local bonds.\nThe first wave of persecutions targeted primarily the princely clans of Russia, notably the influential families of Suzdal. Ivan executed, exiled or forcibly &lt;a href=\"tonsure\"&gt;tonsure&lt;/a&gt;d prominent members of the boyar clans on questionable accusations of conspiracy. Among those who were executed were the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Philip\"&gt;Metropolitan Philip&lt;/a&gt; and the prominent warlord &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Gorbaty-Shuisky\"&gt;Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky&lt;/a&gt;. In 1566, Ivan extended the oprichnina to eight central districts. Of the 12,000 nobles, 570 became oprichniki and the rest were expelled.\nUnder the new political system, the oprichniki were given large estates but, unlike the previous landlords, could not be held accountable for their actions. The men \"took virtually all the peasants possessed, forcing them to pay 'in one year as much as [they] used to pay in ten. That degree of oppression resulted in increasing cases of peasants fleeing, which, in turn, reduced the overall production. The price of grain increased ten-fold.\nSack of Novgorod.\nConditions under the Oprichnina were worsened by the 1570 epidemic, a plague that killed 10,000 people in Novgorod and 600 to 1,000 daily in Moscow. During the grim conditions of the epidemic, a famine and the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Livonian%20War\"&gt;Livonian War&lt;/a&gt;, Ivan grew suspicious that noblemen of the wealthy city of Novgorod were planning to defect and to place the city itself into the control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A Novgorod citizen Petr Volynets warned the tsar about the alleged conspiracy, which modern historians believe to be false. In 1570, Ivan ordered the Oprichniki to raid the city. The Oprichniki burned and pillaged Novgorod and the surrounding villages, and the city has never regained its former prominence.\nCasualty figures vary greatly from different sources. The First Pskov Chronicle estimates the number of victims at 60,000. According to the Third Novgorod Chronicle, the massacre lasted for five weeks. The massacre of Novgorod consisted of men, women and children that were tied to sleighs and run into the freezing waters of the &lt;a href=\"Volkhov\"&gt;Volkhov&lt;/a&gt; River, which Ivan ordered on the basis of unproved accusations of treason. He then tortured its inhabitants and killed thousands in a pogrom. The archbishop was also hunted to death. Almost every day, 500 or 600 people were killed or drowned, but the official death toll named 1,500 of Novgorod's \"big\" people (nobility) and mentioned only about the same number of \"smaller\" people. Many modern researchers estimate the number of victims to range from 2,000 to 3,000 since after the famine and epidemics of the 1560s, the population of Novgorod most likely did not exceed 10,000\u201320,000. Many survivors were &lt;a href=\"Deportation\"&gt;deported&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere.\nThe Oprichnina did not live long after the sack of Novgorod. During the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Crimean%20War%20%281571%29\"&gt;1571\u201372 Russo-Crimean War&lt;/a&gt;, the Oprichniki failed to prove themselves worthy against a regular army. In 1572, Ivan abolished the Oprichnina and disbanded his oprichniki.\nPretended resignation.\nIn 1575, Ivan once again pretended to resign from his title and proclaimed &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Bekbulatovich\"&gt;Simeon Bekbulatovich&lt;/a&gt;, his statesman of Tatar origin, the new \"Grand Prince of All Rus\"'. Simeon reigned as a figurehead leader for about a year. According to the English envoy &lt;a href=\"Giles%20Fletcher%2C%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Giles Fletcher, the Elder&lt;/a&gt;, Simeon acted under Ivan's instructions to confiscate all of the lands that belonged to monasteries, and Ivan pretended to disagree with the decision. When the throne was returned to Ivan in 1576, he returned some of the confiscated land and kept the rest.\nForeign policy.\nDiplomacy and trade.\nIn 1547, Hans Schlitte, the agent of Ivan, recruited craftsmen in Germany for work in Russia. However, all of the craftsmen were arrested in &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BCbeck\"&gt;L\u00fcbeck&lt;/a&gt; at the request of Poland and &lt;a href=\"Livonia\"&gt;Livonia&lt;/a&gt;. The German merchant companies ignored the new &lt;a href=\"Ivangorod\"&gt;port built by Ivan&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Narva%20River\"&gt;River Narva&lt;/a&gt; in 1550 and continued to deliver goods in the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt; ports owned by Livonia. Russia remained isolated from sea trade.\nIvan established close ties with the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20England\"&gt;Kingdom of England&lt;/a&gt;. Russian-English relations can be traced to 1551, when the &lt;a href=\"Muscovy%20Company\"&gt;Muscovy Company&lt;/a&gt; was formed by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Chancellor\"&gt;Richard Chancellor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20Cabot%20%28explorer%29\"&gt;Sebastian Cabot&lt;/a&gt;, Sir &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Willoughby\"&gt;Hugh Willoughby&lt;/a&gt; and several London merchants. In 1553, Chancellor sailed to the &lt;a href=\"White%20Sea\"&gt;White Sea&lt;/a&gt; and continued overland to Moscow, where he visited Ivan's court. Ivan opened up the White Sea and the port of &lt;a href=\"Arkhangelsk\"&gt;Arkhangelsk&lt;/a&gt; to the company and granted it privilege of trading throughout his reign without paying the standard customs fees.\nWith the use of English merchants, Ivan engaged in a long correspondence with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Elizabeth I of England&lt;/a&gt;. While the queen focused on commerce, Ivan was more interested in a military alliance. During his troubled relations with the boyars, Ivan even asked her for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England if his rule was jeopardised. Elizabeth agreed if he provided for himself during his stay.\nIvan corresponded with overseas Orthodox leaders. In response to a letter of &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20Joachim%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;Patriarch Joachim of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt; asking him for financial assistance for the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Catherine%27s%20Monastery\"&gt;Saint Catherine's Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Sinai%20Peninsula\"&gt;Sinai Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, which had suffered by the Turks, Ivan sent in 1558 a delegation to &lt;a href=\"Egypt%20Eyalet\"&gt;Egypt Eyalet&lt;/a&gt; by Archdeacon Gennady, who, however, died in &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; before he could reach Egypt. From then on, the embassy was headed by &lt;a href=\"Smolensk\"&gt;Smolensk&lt;/a&gt; merchant Vasily Poznyakov, whose delegation visited Alexandria, Cairo and Sinai; brought the patriarch a &lt;a href=\"fur%20coat\"&gt;fur coat&lt;/a&gt; and an icon sent by Ivan and left an interesting account of his two-and-a-half years of travels.\nIvan was the first ruler to begin cooperating with the free cossacks on a large scale. Relations were handled through the Posolsky Prikaz diplomatic department; Moscow sent them money and weapons, while tolerating their freedoms, to draw them into an alliance against the Tatars. The first evidence of cooperation surfaces in 1549 when Ivan ordered the Don Cossacks to attack Crimea.\nConquest of Kazan and Astrakhan.\nWhile Ivan was a child, armies of the &lt;a href=\"Kazan%20Khanate\"&gt;Kazan Khanate&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly raided northeastern Russia. In the 1530s, the Crimean khan formed an offensive alliance with &lt;a href=\"Safa%20Giray%20of%20Kazan\"&gt;Safa Giray of Kazan&lt;/a&gt;, his relative. When Safa Giray invaded &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Muscovy&lt;/a&gt; in December 1540, the Russians used &lt;a href=\"Qasim%20Tatars\"&gt;Qasim Tatars&lt;/a&gt; to contain him. After his advance was stalled near Murom, Safa Giray was forced to withdraw to his own borders.\nThe reverses undermined Safa Giray's authority in Kazan. A pro-Russian party, represented by &lt;a href=\"Shahgali\"&gt;Shahgali&lt;/a&gt;, gained enough popular support to make several attempts to take over the Kazan throne. In 1545, Ivan mounted an expedition to the &lt;a href=\"River%20Volga\"&gt;River Volga&lt;/a&gt; to show his support for the pro-Russians.\nIn 1551, the tsar sent his envoy to the &lt;a href=\"Nogai%20Horde\"&gt;Nogai Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and they promised to maintain neutrality during the impending war. The &lt;a href=\"Ar%20begs\"&gt;Ar begs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Udmurts\"&gt;Udmurts&lt;/a&gt; submitted to Russian authority as well. In 1551, the wooden fort of &lt;a href=\"Sviyazhsk\"&gt;Sviyazhsk&lt;/a&gt; was transported down the Volga from &lt;a href=\"Uglich\"&gt;Uglich&lt;/a&gt; all the way to Kazan. It was used as the Russian \"&lt;a href=\"place%20d%27armes\"&gt;place d'armes&lt;/a&gt;\" during the decisive campaign of 1552.\nOn 16 June 1552, Ivan led a strong Russian army towards Kazan. The last siege of the Tatar capital commenced on 30 August. Under the supervision of Prince &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Gorbaty-Shuisky\"&gt;Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky&lt;/a&gt;, the Russians used &lt;a href=\"battering%20ram\"&gt;battering ram&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"siege%20tower\"&gt;siege tower&lt;/a&gt;, under&lt;a href=\"mining%20%28military%29\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; and 150 cannons. The Russians also had the advantage of efficient &lt;a href=\"military%20engineer\"&gt;military engineer&lt;/a&gt;s. The city's water supply was blocked and the walls were breached. Kazan finally fell on 2 October, its fortifications were razed and much of the population massacred. Many Russian prisoners and slaves were released. Ivan celebrated his victory over Kazan by building several churches with oriental features, most famously &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Basil%27s%20Cathedral\"&gt;Saint Basil's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Red%20Square\"&gt;Red Square&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow. The fall of Kazan was only the beginning of a series of so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Cheremis\"&gt;Cheremis&lt;/a&gt; wars\". The attempts of the Moscow government to gain a foothold on the Middle Volga kept provoking uprisings of local peoples, which was suppressed only with great difficulty. In 1557, the &lt;a href=\"Kazan%20rebellion%20of%201552%E2%80%931556\"&gt;First Cheremis War&lt;/a&gt; ended, and the &lt;a href=\"Bashkirs\"&gt;Bashkirs&lt;/a&gt; accepted Ivan's authority.\nIn campaigns in 1554 and 1556, Russian troops conquered the &lt;a href=\"Astrakhan%20Khanate\"&gt;Astrakhan Khanate&lt;/a&gt; at the mouths of the Volga River, and the new &lt;a href=\"Astrakhan\"&gt;Astrakhan&lt;/a&gt; fortress was built in 1558 by &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Vyrodkov\"&gt;Ivan Vyrodkov&lt;/a&gt; to replace the old Tatar capital. The annexation of the Tatar khanates meant the conquest of vast territories, access to large markets and control of the entire length of the Volga River. Subjugating Muslim khanates turned Muscovy into an empire.\nAfter his conquest of Kazan, Ivan is said to have ordered the crescent, a symbol of Islam, to be placed underneath the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20cross\"&gt;Christian cross&lt;/a&gt; on the domes of Orthodox Christian churches.\nRusso-Turkish War.\nIn 1568, Grand Vizier &lt;a href=\"Sokollu%20Mehmet%20Pa%C5%9Fa\"&gt;Sokollu Mehmet Pa\u015fa&lt;/a&gt;, who was the real power in the administration of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Selim%20II\"&gt;Sultan Selim&lt;/a&gt;, initiated the first encounter between the Ottoman Empire and its future northern rival. The results presaged the many disasters to come. A plan to unite the Volga and Don by a canal was detailed in &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;. In the summer of 1569, a large force under Kasim Pa\u015fa of 1,500 &lt;a href=\"Janissaries\"&gt;Janissaries&lt;/a&gt;, 2,000 Spakhs and a few thousand &lt;a href=\"Azaps\"&gt;Azaps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ak%C4%B1nc%C4%B1s\"&gt;Ak\u0131nc\u0131s&lt;/a&gt; were sent to lay siege to &lt;a href=\"Astrakhan\"&gt;Astrakhan&lt;/a&gt; and to begin the canal works while an Ottoman fleet besieged &lt;a href=\"Azov\"&gt;Azov&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn early 1570, Ivan's ambassadors concluded a treaty at Constantinople that restored friendly relations between the Sultan and the Tsar.\nLivonian War.\nIn 1558, Ivan launched the &lt;a href=\"Livonian%20War\"&gt;Livonian War&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; and its major trade routes. The war ultimately proved unsuccessful and stretched on for 24 years and engaging the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Sweden%20%281523%E2%80%931611%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Teutonic%20Knights\"&gt;Teutonic Knights&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Livonia\"&gt;Livonia&lt;/a&gt;. The prolonged war had nearly destroyed the economy, and the \"Oprichnina\" had thoroughly disrupted the government. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Lublin\"&gt;Union of Lublin&lt;/a&gt; had united the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Poland%20%281385%E2%80%931569%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Poland&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Polish-Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; acquired an energetic leader, &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Batory\"&gt;Stefan Batory&lt;/a&gt;, who was supported by Russia's southern enemy, the Ottoman Empire. Ivan's realm was being squeezed by two of the time's great powers.\nAfter rejecting peace proposals from his enemies, Ivan had found himself in a difficult position by 1579. The displaced refugees fleeing the war compounded the effects of the simultaneous drought, and the exacerbated war engendered epidemics causing much loss of life.\nBatory then launched a series of offensives against Muscovy in the campaign seasons of 1579\u201381 to try to cut the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Livonia\"&gt;Kingdom of Livonia&lt;/a&gt; from Muscovy. During his first offensive in 1579, he retook &lt;a href=\"Polotsk\"&gt;Polotsk&lt;/a&gt; with 22,000 men. During the second, in 1580, he took &lt;a href=\"Velikie%20Luki\"&gt;Velikie Luki&lt;/a&gt; with a 29,000-strong force. Finally, he began the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Pskov\"&gt;Siege of Pskov&lt;/a&gt; in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army. &lt;a href=\"Narva\"&gt;Narva&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, was reconquered by Sweden in 1581.\nUnlike Sweden and Poland, &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20II%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Frederick II of Denmark&lt;/a&gt; had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy. He came to an agreement with &lt;a href=\"John%20III%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;John III of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; in 1580 to transfer the Danish titles of Livonia to John III. Muscovy recognised Polish\u2013Lithuanian control of Livonia only in 1582. After &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20von%20Lyffland\"&gt;Magnus von Lyffland&lt;/a&gt;, the brother of Fredrick II and a former ally of Ivan, died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Courland\"&gt;Duchy of Courland&lt;/a&gt;, and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance. Except for the island of &lt;a href=\"Saaremaa\"&gt;Saaremaa&lt;/a&gt;, Denmark had left Livonia by 1585.\nCrimean raids.\nIn the later years of Ivan's reign, the southern borders of Muscovy were disturbed by Crimean Tatars, mainly to capture slaves. (See also &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Slavery in the Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;.) Khan &lt;a href=\"Devlet%20I%20Giray\"&gt;Devlet I Giray&lt;/a&gt; of Crimea repeatedly raided the Moscow region. In 1571, the 40,000-strong Crimean and Turkish army launched a large-scale raid. The ongoing Livonian War made Moscow's garrison to number only 6,000 and could not even delay the Tatar approach. Unresisted, Devlet devastated unprotected towns and villages around Moscow and caused the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20of%20Moscow%20%281571%29\"&gt;Fire of Moscow (1571)&lt;/a&gt;. Historians have estimated the number of casualties of the fire to be 10,000 to 80,000.\nTo buy peace from Devlet Giray, Ivan was forced to relinquish his claims on &lt;a href=\"Astrakhan\"&gt;Astrakhan&lt;/a&gt; for the Crimean Khanate, but the proposed transfer was only a diplomatic maneuver and was never actually completed. The defeat angered Ivan. Between 1571 and 1572, preparations were made upon his orders. In addition to &lt;a href=\"Zasechnaya%20cherta\"&gt;Zasechnaya cherta&lt;/a&gt;, innovative fortifications were set beyond the &lt;a href=\"Oka%20River\"&gt;Oka River&lt;/a&gt;, which defined the border.\nThe following year, Devlet launched another raid on Moscow, now with a numerous horde, reinforced by Turkish &lt;a href=\"janissaries\"&gt;janissaries&lt;/a&gt; equipped with firearms and cannons. The Russian army, led by Prince &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Vorotynsky\"&gt;Mikhail Vorotynsky&lt;/a&gt;, was half the size but was experienced and supported by &lt;a href=\"streltsy\"&gt;streltsy&lt;/a&gt;, equipped with modern firearms and &lt;a href=\"gulyay-gorod\"&gt;gulyay-gorod&lt;/a&gt;s. In addition, it was no longer artificially divided into two parts (the \"oprichnina\" and \"zemsky\"), unlike during the 1571 defeat. On 27 July, the horde broke through the defensive line along the Oka River and moved towards Moscow. The Russian troops did not have time to intercept it, but the regiment of Prince Khvorostinin vigorously attacked the Tatars from the rear. The Khan stopped only 30\u00a0km from Moscow and brought down his entire army back on the Russians, who managed to take up defense near the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Molodi\"&gt;village of Molodi&lt;/a&gt;. After several days of heavy fighting, Mikhail Vorotynsky with the main part of the army flanked the Tatars and dealt a sudden blow on 2 August, and Khvorostinin made a &lt;a href=\"sortie%20%28siege%20warfare%29\"&gt;sortie&lt;/a&gt; from the fortifications. The Tatars were completely defeated and fled. The next year, Ivan, who had sat out in distant Novgorod during the battle, killed Mikhail Vorotynsky.\nConquest of Siberia.\nDuring Ivan's reign, Russia started a large-scale exploration and colonization of &lt;a href=\"Siberia\"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1555, shortly after the conquest of Kazan, the Siberian khan Yadegar and the &lt;a href=\"Nogai%20Horde\"&gt;Nogai Horde&lt;/a&gt;, under Khan Ismail, pledged their allegiance to Ivan in the hope that he would help them against their opponents. However, Yadegar failed to gather the full sum of tribute that he proposed to the tsar and so Ivan did nothing to save his inefficient vassal. In 1563, Yadegar was overthrown and killed by &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Kuchum\"&gt;Khan Kuchum&lt;/a&gt;, who denied any tribute to Moscow.\nIn 1558, Ivan gave the &lt;a href=\"Stroganov%20family\"&gt;Stroganov merchant family&lt;/a&gt; the patent for colonising \"the abundant region along the Kama River\", and, in 1574, lands over the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20Mountains\"&gt;Ural Mountains&lt;/a&gt; along the rivers &lt;a href=\"Tura%20River\"&gt;Tura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tobol\"&gt;Tobol&lt;/a&gt;. The family also received permission to build forts along the &lt;a href=\"Ob%20River\"&gt;Ob River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Irtysh%20River\"&gt;Irtysh River&lt;/a&gt;. Around 1577, the Stroganovs engaged the Cossack leader &lt;a href=\"Yermak%20Timofeyevich\"&gt;Yermak Timofeyevich&lt;/a&gt; to protect their lands from attacks of the Siberian &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Kuchum\"&gt;Khan Kuchum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1580, Yermak started his conquest of Siberia. With some 540 &lt;a href=\"Cossacks\"&gt;Cossacks&lt;/a&gt;, he started to penetrate territories that were tributary to Kuchum. Yermak pressured and persuaded the various family-based tribes to change their loyalties and to become tributaries of Russia. Some agreed voluntarily because they were offered better terms than with Kuchum, but others were forced. He also established distant forts in the newly conquered lands. The campaign was successful, and the Cossacks managed to defeat the Siberian army in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Chuvash%20Cape\"&gt;Battle of Chuvash Cape&lt;/a&gt;, but Yermak still needed reinforcements. He sent an envoy to Ivan the Terrible with a message that proclaimed Yermak-conquered Siberia to be part of Russia to the dismay of the Stroganovs, who had planned to keep Siberia for themselves. Ivan agreed to reinforce the Cossacks with his streltsy, but the detachment sent to Siberia died of starvation without any benefit. The Cossacks were defeated by the local peoples, Yermak died and the survivors immediately left Siberia. Only in 1586, two years after the death of Ivan, would the Russians manage to gain a foothold in Siberia by founding the city of &lt;a href=\"Tyumen\"&gt;Tyumen&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and children.\nIvan the Terrible had at least six, possibly eight, wives, although only four of them were recognised by the Church. Three of them were apparently poisoned by his enemies or by aristocratic families, who wanted to promote their daughters to be his brides.\nIn 1581, Ivan beat his pregnant daughter-in-law, &lt;a href=\"Yelena%20Sheremeteva\"&gt;Yelena Sheremeteva&lt;/a&gt;, for wearing immodest clothing, which may have caused a miscarriage. His second son, also named &lt;a href=\"Tsarevich%20Ivan%20Ivanovich%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Ivan&lt;/a&gt;, upon learning of that, engaged in a heated argument with his father, which resulted in Ivan striking his son in the head with his pointed staff and fatally wounding him. That event is depicted in the famous painting by &lt;a href=\"Ilya%20Repin\"&gt;Ilya Repin&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Ivan%20the%20Terrible%20and%20His%20Son%20Ivan\"&gt;Ivan the Terrible and his son Ivan on Friday, 16 November 1581&lt;/a&gt;\", better known as \"Ivan the Terrible killing his son\".\nArts.\nIvan was a poet and a composer of considerable talent. His Orthodox liturgical hymn, \"Stichiron No. 1 in Honor of St. Peter\", and fragments of his letters were put into music by the Soviet composer &lt;a href=\"Rodion%20Shchedrin\"&gt;Rodion Shchedrin&lt;/a&gt;. The recording, the first Soviet-produced CD, was released in 1988 to mark the millennium of Christianity in Russia.\nEpistles.\n&lt;a href=\"D.%20S.%20Mirsky\"&gt;D. S. Mirsky&lt;/a&gt; called Ivan \"a pamphleteer of genius\". The letters are often the only existing source on Ivan's personality and provide crucial information on his reign, but Harvard professor &lt;a href=\"Edward%20L.%20Keenan\"&gt;Edward L. Keenan&lt;/a&gt; has argued that the letters are 17th-century forgeries. That contention, however, has not been widely accepted, and most other scholars, such as John Fennell and &lt;a href=\"Ruslan%20Skrynnikov\"&gt;Ruslan Skrynnikov&lt;/a&gt;, have continued to argue for their authenticity. Recent archival discoveries of 16th-century copies of the letters strengthen the argument for their authenticity.\nReligion.\nIvan was a devoted follower of Christian Orthodoxy but in his own specific manner. He placed the most emphasis on defending the divine right of the ruler to unlimited power under God. Some scholars explain the sadistic and brutal deeds of Ivan the Terrible with the religious concepts of the 16th century, which included drowning and roasting people alive or torturing victims with boiling or freezing water, corresponding to the torments of Hell. That was consistent with Ivan's view of being God's representative on Earth with a sacred right and duty to punish. He may also have been inspired by the model of &lt;a href=\"Archangel%20Michael\"&gt;Archangel Michael&lt;/a&gt; with the idea of divine punishment.\nDespite the absolute prohibition of the Church for even the fourth marriage, Ivan had seven wives, and even while his seventh wife was alive, he was negotiating to marry Mary &lt;a href=\"George%20Hastings%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Huntingdon\"&gt;Hastings&lt;/a&gt;, a distant relative of Queen &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I\"&gt;Elizabeth of England&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, &lt;a href=\"polygamy\"&gt;polygamy&lt;/a&gt; was also prohibited by the Church, but Ivan planned to \"put his wife away\". Ivan freely interfered in church affairs by ousting &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Philip\"&gt;Metropolitan Philip&lt;/a&gt; and ordering him to be killed and accusing of treason and deposing the second-oldest hierarch, &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Novgorod\"&gt;Novgorod Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; Pimen. Many monks were tortured to death during the &lt;a href=\"Massacre%20of%20Novgorod\"&gt;Massacre of Novgorod&lt;/a&gt;.\nIvan was somewhat tolerant of &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, which was widespread in the territories of the conquered Tatar khanates, since he was afraid of the wrath of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20sultan\"&gt;Ottoman sultan&lt;/a&gt;. However, his &lt;a href=\"anti-Semitism\"&gt;anti-Semitism&lt;/a&gt; was so fierce that no pragmatic considerations could hold him back. For example, after the capture of &lt;a href=\"Polotsk\"&gt;Polotsk&lt;/a&gt;, all unconverted Jews were drowned, despite their role in the city's economy.\nDeath.\nIvan died from a &lt;a href=\"stroke\"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; while he was playing &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Belsky\"&gt;Bogdan Belsky&lt;/a&gt; on . Upon Ivan's death, the Russian throne was left to his unfit middle son, &lt;a href=\"Feodor%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Feodor&lt;/a&gt;, a weak-minded figure. Feodor died childless in 1598, which ushered in the &lt;a href=\"Time%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Time of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nLittle is known about Ivan's appearance, as virtually all existing portraits were made after his death and contain uncertain amounts of &lt;a href=\"artist%27s%20impression\"&gt;artist's impression&lt;/a&gt;. In 1567, the ambassador Daniel Prinz von Buchau described Ivan as follows: \"He is tall, stout and full of energy. His eyes are big, observing and restless. His beard is reddish-black, long and thick, but most other hairs on his head are shaved off according to the Russian habits of the time\".\nAccording to , the son-in-law of &lt;a href=\"Michael%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Michael I of Russia&lt;/a&gt;, Ivan had an unpleasant face with a long and crooked nose. He was tall and athletically built, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist.\nIn 1963, the graves of Ivan and his sons were excavated and examined by Soviet scientists. Chemical and structural analysis of his remains disproved earlier suggestions that Ivan suffered from &lt;a href=\"syphilis\"&gt;syphilis&lt;/a&gt; or that he was poisoned by arsenic or strangled. At the time of his death, he was 178\u00a0cm tall (5\u00a0ft. 10 in.) and weighed 85\u201390\u00a0kg (187\u2013198\u00a0lb.). His body was rather asymmetrical, had a large amount of &lt;a href=\"osteophyte\"&gt;osteophyte&lt;/a&gt;s uncharacteristic of his age and contained excessive concentration of mercury. Researchers concluded that Ivan was athletically built in his youth but, in his last years, had developed various bone diseases and could barely move. They attributed the high mercury content in his body due to his use of ointments to heal his joints.\nLegacy.\nIvan completely altered Russia's governmental structure, establishing the character of modern Russian political organisation. Ivan's creation of the &lt;a href=\"Oprichnina\"&gt;Oprichnina&lt;/a&gt;, answerable only to him, afforded him personal protection but also curtailed the traditional powers and rights of the boyars. Henceforth, Tsarist autocracy and despotism would lie at the heart of the Russian state. Ivan bypassed the &lt;a href=\"Mestnichestvo\"&gt;Mestnichestvo&lt;/a&gt; system and offered positions of power to his supporters among the minor gentry. The empire's local administration combined both locally and centrally appointed officials; the system proved durable and practical and sufficiently flexible to tolerate later modification.\nIvan's expedition against Poland failed at a military level, but it helped extend Russia's trade, political and cultural links with other European states. &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Great\"&gt;Peter the Great&lt;/a&gt; built on those connections in his bid to make Russia a major European power. At Ivan's death, the empire encompassed the Caspian to the southwest and Western Siberia to the east. His southern conquests ignited several conflicts with the expansionist Turkey, whose territories were thus confined to the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; regions.\nIvan's management of Russia's economy proved disastrous, both in his lifetime and afterward. He had inherited a government in debt, and in an effort to raise more revenue for his expansionist wars, he instituted a series of increasingly-unpopular and burdensome taxes. Successive wars drained Russia of manpower and resources and brought it \"to the brink of ruin\". After Ivan's death, his empire's nearly-ruined economy contributed to the decline of his own &lt;a href=\"Rurik%20dynasty\"&gt;Rurik dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Time of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPosthumous Reputation.\nIvan's notorious outbursts and autocratic whims helped characterise the position of tsar as one accountable to no earthly authority but only to God. Tsarist absolutism faced few serious challenges until the 19th century. The earliest and most influential account of his reign prior to 1917 was by the historian &lt;a href=\"Nikolay%20Karamzin\"&gt;N.M.Karamzin&lt;/a&gt;, who described Ivan as a 'tormentor' of his people, particularly from 1560, though even after that date Karamzin believed there was a mix of 'good' and 'evil' in his character. In 1922, the historian &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Wipper\"&gt;Robert Wipper&lt;/a&gt; - who later returned to his native &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; to avoid living under communist rule - wrote a biography that reassessed Ivan as a monarch \"who loved the ordinary people\" and praised his agrarian reforms.\nIn the 1920s, &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Pokrovsky\"&gt;Mikhail Pokrovsky&lt;/a&gt;, who dominated the study of history in the Soviet Union attributed that the success of the \"Oprichnina\" to their being on the side of the small state owners and townsfolk in a decades class long struggle against the large landowners, and downgrade Ivan's role to that of the instrument of the emerging Russian borugeoisie. But in February 1941, the poet &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Pasternak\"&gt;Boris Pasternak&lt;/a&gt; observantly remarked in a letter to his cousin that \"the new cult, openly proselytized, is Ivan the Terrible, the \"Oprichnina\", the brutality.\" &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt;, who had read Wipper's biography had decided that Soviet historians should praise the role of strong leaders, such as Ivan, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Nevsky\"&gt;Alexander Nevsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Great\"&gt;Peter the Great&lt;/a&gt;, who had strengthened and expanded Russia. In post-Soviet Russia, a campaign has been run to seek the granting of &lt;a href=\"sainthood\"&gt;sainthood&lt;/a&gt; to Ivan IV. but the Russian Orthodox Church opposed the idea.\nA consequence was that the writer &lt;a href=\"Aleksey%20Nikolayevich%20Tolstoy\"&gt;Alexei Tolstoy&lt;/a&gt; began work on a stage version of Ivan's life, and &lt;a href=\"Sergei%20Eisenstein\"&gt;Sergei Eisenstein&lt;/a&gt; began what was to be a three part film tribute to Ivan. Both projects were personally supervised by Stalin, at a time when the Soviet Union was engaged in a war with Nazi Germany. He read the scripts of Tolstoy's play and the first of Eisenstein's film in tandem after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kursk\"&gt;Battle of Kursk&lt;/a&gt; in 1943, praised Eisenstein's version but rejected Tolstoy's. It took Tolstoy until 1944 to write a version that satisfied the dictator. Eisenstein's success with \"&lt;a href=\"Ivan%20the%20Terrible%20%281944%20film%29\"&gt;Ivan the Terrible Part 1&lt;/a&gt;\" was not repeated with the follow-up, \"The Boyar's Revolt\", which angered Stalin because it portrayed a man suffering pangs of conscience. Stalin told Eisenstein: \"Ivan the Terrible was very cruel. You can show that he was cruel, but you have to show why it was essential to be cruel. One of Ivan the Terrible's mistakes was that he didn't finish off the five major families.\" The film was suppressed until 1958.\nThe first statue of Ivan the Terrible was officially open in &lt;a href=\"Oryol\"&gt;Oryol&lt;/a&gt;, Russia in 2016. Formally, the statue was unveiled in honor of the 450th anniversary of the founding of Oryol, a Russian city of about 310,000 that was established as a fortress to defend Moscow's southern borders. Informally, there was a big political subtext. The opposition thinks that Ivan the Terrible's rehabilitation echoes of Stalin's era. The erection of the statue was vastly covered in international media like \"The Guardian\", \"The Washington Post\", \"Politico\", and others.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church officially supported the erection of the monument."
