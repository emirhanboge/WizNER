    "text": "Charles, Prince of Wales (Charles Philip Arthur George; born 14 November 1948) is the &lt;a href=\"heir%20apparent\"&gt;heir apparent&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"British%20throne\"&gt;British throne&lt;/a&gt; as the eldest son of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;. He has been heir apparent as well as &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Cornwall\"&gt;Duke of Cornwall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Rothesay\"&gt;Duke of Rothesay&lt;/a&gt; since 1952 and is both the oldest and the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. He is also the longest-serving &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt;, having held the title since July 1958. Upon the &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20funeral%20of%20Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;death of his father&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Prince Philip&lt;/a&gt;, on 9 April 2021, Charles also inherited the title of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Duke of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharles was born in &lt;a href=\"Buckingham%20Palace\"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt; as the first grandchild of &lt;a href=\"George%20VI\"&gt;King George VI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;. He was educated at &lt;a href=\"Cheam%20School\"&gt;Cheam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gordonstoun\"&gt;Gordonstoun&lt;/a&gt; schools, both of which his father attended as a child. He later spent a year at the &lt;a href=\"Timbertop%20%28Geelong%20Grammar%20School%29\"&gt;Timbertop&lt;/a&gt; campus of &lt;a href=\"Geelong%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;Geelong Grammar School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. After earning a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Bachelor of Arts&lt;/a&gt; degree from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, Charles served in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; from 1971 to 1976. In 1981, he &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20of%20Prince%20Charles%20and%20Lady%20Diana%20Spencer\"&gt;married&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Diana%20Spencer\"&gt;Lady Diana Spencer&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he had two sons: &lt;a href=\"Prince%20William\"&gt;William&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Harry\"&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt;. In 1996, the couple divorced following well-publicised extramarital affairs by both parties. Diana &lt;a href=\"Death%20of%20Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales\"&gt;died as the result of a car crash&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; the following year. In 2005, Charles &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20of%20Prince%20Charles%20and%20Camilla%20Parker%20Bowles\"&gt;married&lt;/a&gt; his long-term partner &lt;a href=\"Camilla%20Parker%20Bowles\"&gt;Camilla Parker Bowles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Prince of Wales, Charles undertakes official duties on behalf of the Queen. He founded &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Trust\"&gt;The Prince's Trust&lt;/a&gt; in 1976, sponsors &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Charities\"&gt;The Prince's Charities&lt;/a&gt;, and is a patron, president, or a member of over 400 other charities and organisations. As a self-described &lt;a href=\"environmentalist\"&gt;environmentalist&lt;/a&gt;, Charles has spoken publicly about issues such as &lt;a href=\"organic%20farming\"&gt;organic farming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"climate%20change\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, which has earned him &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20awards%20received%20by%20Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;awards and recognition&lt;/a&gt; from environmental groups. His support for &lt;a href=\"alternative%20medicine\"&gt;alternative medicine&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"homeopathy\"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;, has been the subject of criticism. His views on the role of architecture in society and the conservation of historic buildings have received significant attention from British architects and design critics. Since 1993, Charles has worked on the creation of &lt;a href=\"Poundbury\"&gt;Poundbury&lt;/a&gt;, an experimental &lt;a href=\"new%20town\"&gt;new town&lt;/a&gt; based on his architectural tastes. He is also an author or co-author of a &lt;a href=\"Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales%2C%20bibliography\"&gt;number of books&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life, family and education.\nCharles was born in Buckingham Palace on 14 November 1948, during the reign of his maternal grandfather &lt;a href=\"George%20VI\"&gt;George VI&lt;/a&gt;, as the first child of &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Philip, Duke of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;. He was baptised there by the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20Fisher\"&gt;Geoffrey Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, on 15 December 1948.\nThe death of his grandfather and the accession of his mother as Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 made Charles the &lt;a href=\"heir%20apparent\"&gt;heir apparent&lt;/a&gt;. As the monarch's eldest son, he automatically assumed the titles &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Cornwall\"&gt;Duke of Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Rothesay\"&gt;Duke of Rothesay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Carrick\"&gt;Earl of Carrick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20of%20Renfrew%20%28title%29\"&gt;Baron of Renfrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20the%20Isles\"&gt;Lord of the Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20and%20Great%20Steward%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Prince and Great Steward of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. Charles attended &lt;a href=\"Coronation%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;his mother's coronation&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt; on 2 June 1953.\nAs was customary for upper-class children at the time, a &lt;a href=\"governess\"&gt;governess&lt;/a&gt;, Catherine Peebles, was appointed and undertook his education between the ages of five and eight. Buckingham Palace announced in 1955 that Charles would attend school rather than have a private tutor, making him the first heir apparent to be educated in that manner. On 7 November 1956, Charles commenced classes at &lt;a href=\"Hill%20House%20School\"&gt;Hill House School&lt;/a&gt; in west London. He did not receive preferential treatment from the school's founder and headmaster, &lt;a href=\"Stuart%20Townend%20%28headmaster%29\"&gt;Stuart Townend&lt;/a&gt;, who advised the Queen to have Charles train in &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; because the boys were never deferential to anyone on the football field. Charles then attended two of his father's former schools, &lt;a href=\"Cheam%20School\"&gt;Cheam Preparatory School&lt;/a&gt; in Berkshire, England, from 1958, followed by &lt;a href=\"Gordonstoun\"&gt;Gordonstoun&lt;/a&gt; in the north-east of Scotland, beginning classes there in April 1962. \nThough he reportedly described Gordonstoun, noted for its especially rigorous curriculum, as \"&lt;a href=\"Colditz%20Castle\"&gt;Colditz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"kilt\"&gt;kilt&lt;/a&gt;s\", Charles subsequently praised Gordonstoun, stating it had taught him \"a great deal about myself and my own abilities and disabilities. It taught me to accept challenges and take the initiative.\" In a 1975 interview, he said he was \"glad\" he had attended Gordonstoun and that the \"toughness of the place\" was \"much exaggerated\". He spent two terms in 1966 at the &lt;a href=\"Timbertop%20%28Geelong%20Grammar%20School%29\"&gt;Timbertop&lt;/a&gt; campus of &lt;a href=\"Geelong%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;Geelong Grammar School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, during which time he visited &lt;a href=\"Papua%20New%20Guinea\"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; on a school trip with his history tutor, Michael Collins Persse. In 1973, Charles described his time at Timbertop as the most enjoyable part of his whole education. Upon his return to Gordonstoun, Charles emulated his father in becoming &lt;a href=\"Head%20girl%20and%20head%20boy\"&gt;Head Boy&lt;/a&gt;. He left in 1967, with six &lt;a href=\"GCE%20Ordinary%20Level\"&gt;GCE O-levels&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"GCE%20Advanced%20Level\"&gt;A-levels&lt;/a&gt; in history and French, at grades B and C respectively. On his early education, Charles later remarked, \"I didn't enjoy school as much as I might have, but that was only because I'm happier at home than anywhere else.\"\nCharles broke royal tradition a second time when he proceeded straight to university after his A-levels, rather than joining the &lt;a href=\"British%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;British Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. In October 1967, he was admitted to &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Trinity College, Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, where he read &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anthropology\"&gt;anthropology&lt;/a&gt; for the first part of the &lt;a href=\"Tripos\"&gt;Tripos&lt;/a&gt;, and then changed to &lt;a href=\"history\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; for the second part. During his second year, Charles attended the &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20University\"&gt;University College of Wales&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth\"&gt;Aberystwyth&lt;/a&gt;, studying &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Welsh history&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; for a term. He graduated from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification\"&gt;2:2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Bachelor of Arts&lt;/a&gt; (BA) degree on 23 June 1970, the first British heir apparent to earn a university degree. On 2 August 1975, he was awarded a &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Arts%20%28Oxbridge%20and%20Dublin%29\"&gt;Master of Arts (MA Cantab)&lt;/a&gt; degree by Cambridge. At Cambridge, Master of Arts is an academic rank, not a postgraduate degree.\nPrince of Wales.\nCharles was created &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Chester\"&gt;Earl of Chester&lt;/a&gt; on 26 July 1958, though &lt;a href=\"Investiture%20of%20Prince%20Charles\"&gt;his investiture&lt;/a&gt; was not held until 1 July 1969, when he was crowned by his mother in a televised ceremony held at &lt;a href=\"Caernarfon%20Castle\"&gt;Caernarfon Castle&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28House%20of%20Lords%29\"&gt;took his seat&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lords\"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt; in 1970, and he made his &lt;a href=\"maiden%20speech\"&gt;maiden speech&lt;/a&gt; in June 1974, the first royal to speak from the floor since the future &lt;a href=\"Edward%20VII\"&gt;Edward VII&lt;/a&gt; in 1884. He spoke again in 1975. Charles began to take on more public duties, founding &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Trust\"&gt;The Prince's Trust&lt;/a&gt; in 1976, and travelling to the United States in 1981. In the mid-1970s, the prince expressed an interest in serving as &lt;a href=\"Governor-General%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Governor-General of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, at the suggestion of Australian prime minister &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Fraser\"&gt;Malcolm Fraser&lt;/a&gt;, but because of a lack of public enthusiasm nothing came of the proposal. Charles commented: \"So, what are you supposed to think when you are prepared to do something to help and you are just told you're not wanted?\"\nCharles is the longest-serving Prince of Wales, having surpassed the record held by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20VII\"&gt;Edward VII&lt;/a&gt; on 9 September 2017. He is the oldest and longest-serving British heir apparent, the longest-serving Duke of Cornwall, and the longest-serving Duke of Rothesay. If he becomes monarch, he will be the oldest person to do so, the current record holder being &lt;a href=\"William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;William IV&lt;/a&gt;, who was 64 when he became king in 1830.\nOfficial duties.\nIn 2008, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\" described Charles as the \"hardest-working member of the royal family.\" He carried out 560 official engagements in 2008, 499 in 2010, and over 600 in 2011.\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles undertakes official duties on behalf of the Queen. He officiates at &lt;a href=\"investiture\"&gt;investiture&lt;/a&gt;s and attends the funerals of foreign dignitaries. Prince Charles makes regular tours of Wales, fulfilling a week of engagements each summer, and attending important national occasions, such as opening the &lt;a href=\"Senedd%20building\"&gt;Senedd&lt;/a&gt;. The six trustees of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Collection%20Trust\"&gt;Royal Collection Trust&lt;/a&gt; meet three times a year under his chairmanship. Prince Charles travels abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom. Charles has been regarded as an effective advocate of the country. In 1983, &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20John%20Lewis\"&gt;Christopher John Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, who had fired a shot with a &lt;a href=\".22%20Long%20Rifle\"&gt;.22 rifle&lt;/a&gt; at the Queen in 1981, attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital in order to assassinate Charles, who was visiting New Zealand with Diana and William. While visiting Australia in January 1994, two shots from a &lt;a href=\"starting%20pistol\"&gt;starting pistol&lt;/a&gt; were fired at him on &lt;a href=\"Australia%20Day\"&gt;Australia Day&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"David%20Kang\"&gt;David Kang&lt;/a&gt; in protest of the treatment of several hundred Cambodian asylum seekers held in detention camps. In 1995, Charles became the first member of the royal family to visit the Republic of Ireland in an official capacity.\nIn 2000, Charles revived the tradition of the Prince of Wales having an &lt;a href=\"Official%20Harpist%20to%20the%20Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;official harpist&lt;/a&gt;, in order to foster Welsh talent at playing the harp, the national instrument of Wales. He and the Duchess of Cornwall also spend one week each year in Scotland, where he is patron of several Scottish organisations. His service to the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Forces\"&gt;Canadian Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; permits him to be informed of troop activities, and allows him to visit these troops while in Canada or overseas, taking part in ceremonial occasions. For instance, in 2001 he placed a specially commissioned wreath, made from vegetation taken from French battlefields, at the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier\"&gt;Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1981 he became the patron of the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Warplane%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"funeral%20of%20Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;funeral of Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, Charles unintentionally caused controversy when he shook hands with &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Mugabe\"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Zimbabwe\"&gt;President of Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;, who had been seated next to him. Charles's office subsequently released a statement saying: \"The Prince of Wales was caught by surprise and not in a position to avoid shaking Mr Mugabe's hand. The Prince finds the current Zimbabwean regime abhorrent. He has supported the Zimbabwe Defence and Aid Fund, which works with those being oppressed by the regime. The Prince also recently met &lt;a href=\"Pius%20Ncube\"&gt;Pius Ncube&lt;/a&gt;, the Archbishop of Bulawayo, an outspoken critic of the government.\" In November 2001, Charles was struck in the face with three red carnations by teenager &lt;a href=\"Alina%20Lebedeva\"&gt;Alina Lebedeva&lt;/a&gt;, whilst he was on an official visit to Latvia.\nIn 2010, Charles represented the Queen at the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Commonwealth%20Games%20opening%20ceremony\"&gt;opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;2010 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Delhi\"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. He attends official events in the United Kingdom in support of Commonwealth countries, such as the &lt;a href=\"Christchurch\"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt; earthquake memorial service at &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt; in 2011. From 15 to 17 November 2013, he represented the Queen for the first time at a &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Heads%20of%20Government%20Meeting\"&gt;Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Colombo\"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;.\nLetters sent by Prince Charles to government ministers during 2004 and 2005 \u2013 the so-called &lt;a href=\"black%20spider%20memos\"&gt;black spider memos&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 presented potential embarrassment following a challenge by \"The Guardian\" newspaper to release the letters under the &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act%202000\"&gt;Freedom of Information Act 2000&lt;/a&gt;. In March 2015, the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Supreme Court of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; decided that the Prince's letters must be released. The letters were published by the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20Office\"&gt;Cabinet Office&lt;/a&gt; on 13 May 2015. Reaction to the memos upon their release was largely supportive of Charles, with little criticism of him. The memos were variously described in the press as \"underwhelming\" and \"harmless\" and that their release had \"backfired on those who seek to belittle him\", with reaction from the public also supportive.\nThe Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall made their first joint trip to the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in May 2015. The trip was called an important step in \"promoting peace and reconciliation\" by the British Embassy. During the trip, Charles shook hands with &lt;a href=\"Sinn%20F%C3%A9in\"&gt;Sinn F\u00e9in&lt;/a&gt; and supposed &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Republican%20Army\"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Gerry%20Adams\"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Galway\"&gt;Galway&lt;/a&gt;, which was described by the media as a \"historic handshake\" and a \"significant moment for Anglo-Irish relations\". In the run up to the Prince's visit, two &lt;a href=\"Irish%20republican\"&gt;Irish republican&lt;/a&gt; dissidents were arrested for planning a bomb attack. &lt;a href=\"Semtex\"&gt;Semtex&lt;/a&gt; and rockets were found at the &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; home of suspect Donal \u00d3 Coisdealbha, member of a self-styled \"&lt;a href=\"%C3%93glaigh%20na%20h%C3%89ireann\"&gt;\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann&lt;/a&gt;\" organisation, who was later jailed for five and a half years. He was connected to a veteran republican, Seamus McGrane of &lt;a href=\"County%20Louth\"&gt;County Louth&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Real%20IRA\"&gt;Real IRA&lt;/a&gt;, who was jailed for 11 and a half years. In 2015, it was revealed that Prince Charles had access to confidential UK cabinet papers.\nCharles has made frequent visits to &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; in order to promote arms exports for companies such as &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems\"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, 2014, and 2015, he met with the commander of Saudi Arabia's National Guard &lt;a href=\"Mutaib%20bin%20Abdullah\"&gt;Mutaib bin Abdullah&lt;/a&gt;. In February 2014, he took part in a traditional sword dance with members of the Saudi royal family at the Janariyah festival in Riyadh. At the same festival, British arms company BAE Systems was honoured by Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz. Charles was criticised by Scottish MP &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Ferrier\"&gt;Margaret Ferrier&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 over his role in the sale of &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems%23Products\"&gt;Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; fighter jets to Saudi Arabia. According to Charles's biographer Catherine Mayer, a \"Time\" magazine journalist who claims to have interviewed several sources from Prince Charles's inner circle, he \"doesn't like being used to market weaponry\" in deals with Saudi Arabia and other Arab Gulf states. According to Mayer, Charles has only raised his objections to being used to sell weapons abroad in private.\nCommonwealth heads of government decided at their &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Heads%20of%20Government%20Meeting%202018\"&gt;2018 meeting&lt;/a&gt; that the Prince of Wales will be the next &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20the%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Head of the Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; after the Queen. The head is chosen and therefore not hereditary.\nOn 7 March 2019, the Queen hosted a Buckingham Palace event to mark the 50th anniversary of Charles's investiture as the Prince of Wales. Guests at the event included the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Theresa%20May\"&gt;Theresa May&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Minister%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Welsh First Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Drakeford\"&gt;Mark Drakeford&lt;/a&gt;. The same month, at the request of the British government, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall went on an official tour to &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, making them the first British royalty to visit the country. The tour was seen as effort to form a closer relationship between the UK and Cuba.\nIn November 2021, Charles attended the ceremonies held to mark &lt;a href=\"Republicanism%20in%20Barbados%232020%20proposal\"&gt;Barbados's transition into a parliamentary republic&lt;/a&gt;, which removed the Queen as their head of state.\nHealth.\nOn 25 March 2020, it was announced that Charles had contracted &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. He and his wife subsequently isolated at their &lt;a href=\"Birkhall\"&gt;Birkhall&lt;/a&gt; residence. Camilla was also tested, but returned a negative result. &lt;a href=\"Clarence%20House\"&gt;Clarence House&lt;/a&gt; stated that he showed \"mild symptoms\" but \"remains in good health\". They further stated \"It is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.\" Several newspapers were critical that Charles and Camilla were tested promptly at a time when many &lt;a href=\"National%20Health%20Service\"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; doctors, nurses and patients had been unable to be tested expeditiously. On 30 March 2020, Clarence House announced that Charles had recovered from the virus, and that, after consulting his doctor, he was no longer isolating. Two days later, he stated in a video that he would continue to practice &lt;a href=\"social%20distancing\"&gt;social distancing&lt;/a&gt;. In February 2021, Charles and his wife received doses of a &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20vaccine\"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary training and career.\nCharles served in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and, following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather and two of his great-grandfathers, in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;. During his second year at Cambridge, he requested and received Royal Air Force training. On 8\u00a0March 1971, he flew himself to the Royal Air Force College &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Cranwell\"&gt;Cranwell&lt;/a&gt; to train as a jet pilot. After the passing-out parade that September, he embarked on a naval career and enrolled in a six-week course at the &lt;a href=\"Britannia%20Royal%20Naval%20College\"&gt;Royal Naval College Dartmouth&lt;/a&gt;. He then served on the guided-missile destroyer (1971\u20131972) and the frigates (1972\u20131973) and (1974). In 1974, he qualified as a helicopter pilot at &lt;a href=\"RNAS%20Yeovilton%20%28HMS%20Heron%29\"&gt;RNAS Yeovilton&lt;/a&gt;, and then joined &lt;a href=\"845%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron\"&gt;845 Naval Air Squadron&lt;/a&gt;, operating from .\nOn 9 February 1976, Charles took command of the coastal minehunter for his last ten months of active service in the navy. He learned to fly on a &lt;a href=\"De%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-1%20Chipmunk\"&gt;Chipmunk&lt;/a&gt; basic pilot trainer, a &lt;a href=\"BAC%20Jet%20Provost\"&gt;BAC Jet Provost&lt;/a&gt; jet trainer, and a &lt;a href=\"Beagle%20Basset\"&gt;Beagle Basset&lt;/a&gt; multi-engine trainer; he then regularly flew the &lt;a href=\"Hawker%20Siddeley%20Andover\"&gt;Hawker Siddeley Andover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westland%20Wessex\"&gt;Westland Wessex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"British%20Aerospace%20146\"&gt;BAe 146&lt;/a&gt; aircraft of &lt;a href=\"The%20Queen%27s%20Flight\"&gt;The Queen's Flight&lt;/a&gt; until he gave up flying after crashing the BAe 146 in the &lt;a href=\"Hebrides\"&gt;Hebrides&lt;/a&gt; in 1994.\nRelationships and marriages.\nBachelorhood.\nIn his youth, Charles was amorously linked to a number of women. His great-uncle &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma\"&gt;Lord Mountbatten&lt;/a&gt; advised him:In a case like yours, the man should sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down, but for a wife he should choose a suitable, attractive, and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for\u00a0... It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage.\nCharles's girlfriends included Georgiana Russell, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"John%20Russell%20%28diplomat%29\"&gt;Sir John Russell&lt;/a&gt;, who was &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20ambassadors%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20Spain\"&gt;British ambassador to Spain&lt;/a&gt;; Lady Jane Wellesley, the daughter of the &lt;a href=\"8th%20Duke%20of%20Wellington\"&gt;8th Duke of Wellington&lt;/a&gt;; Davina Sheffield; &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sarah%20McCorquodale\"&gt;Lady Sarah Spencer&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Camilla%20Shand\"&gt;Camilla Shand&lt;/a&gt;, who later became his second wife and Duchess of Cornwall.\nEarly in 1974, Mountbatten began corresponding with Charles about a potential marriage to &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Amanda%20Ellingworth\"&gt;Amanda Knatchbull&lt;/a&gt;, who was Mountbatten's granddaughter. Charles wrote to Amanda's mother\u2014&lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Knatchbull%2C%202nd%20Countess%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma\"&gt;Lady Brabourne&lt;/a&gt;, who was also his &lt;a href=\"Godparent\"&gt;godmother&lt;/a&gt;\u2014expressing interest in her daughter, to which she replied approvingly, though she suggested that a &lt;a href=\"courtship\"&gt;courtship&lt;/a&gt; with the not yet 17-year-old girl was premature. Four years later, Mountbatten arranged for Amanda and himself to accompany Charles on his 1980 tour of India. Both fathers, however, objected; Philip feared that Charles would be eclipsed by his famous uncle (who had served as the last British &lt;a href=\"Viceroy\"&gt;Viceroy&lt;/a&gt; and first &lt;a href=\"Governor-General%20of%20India\"&gt;Governor-General of India&lt;/a&gt;), while &lt;a href=\"John%20Knatchbull%2C%207th%20Baron%20Brabourne\"&gt;Lord Brabourne&lt;/a&gt; warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple. However, in August 1979, before Charles would depart alone for India, Mountbatten was killed by the IRA. When Charles returned, he proposed to Amanda, but in addition to her grandfather, she had lost her paternal grandmother and youngest brother &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Knatchbull\"&gt;Nicholas&lt;/a&gt; in the bomb attack and was now reluctant to join the royal family. In June 1980, Charles officially turned down &lt;a href=\"Chevening\"&gt;Chevening&lt;/a&gt; House, placed at his disposal since 1974, as his future residence. Chevening, a &lt;a href=\"stately%20home\"&gt;stately home&lt;/a&gt; in Kent, was bequeathed, along with an &lt;a href=\"financial%20endowment\"&gt;endowment&lt;/a&gt;, to the Crown by the last &lt;a href=\"James%20Stanhope%2C%207th%20Earl%20Stanhope\"&gt;Earl Stanhope&lt;/a&gt;, Amanda's childless great-uncle, in the hope that Charles would eventually occupy it. In 1977, a newspaper report mistakenly announced his engagement to &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Marie-Astrid%20of%20Luxembourg\"&gt;Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarriages.\nMarriage to Lady Diana Spencer.\nCharles first met &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Diana%20Spencer\"&gt;Lady Diana Spencer&lt;/a&gt; in 1977 while he was visiting her home, &lt;a href=\"Althorp\"&gt;Althorp&lt;/a&gt;. He was the companion of her elder sister, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sarah%20McCorquodale\"&gt;Sarah&lt;/a&gt;, and did not consider Diana romantically until mid-1980. While Charles and Diana were sitting together on a bale of hay at a friend's barbecue in July, she mentioned that he had looked forlorn and in need of care at the funeral of his granduncle Lord Mountbatten. Soon, according to Charles's chosen biographer, &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Dimbleby\"&gt;Jonathan Dimbleby&lt;/a&gt;, \"without any apparent surge in feeling, he began to think seriously of her as a potential bride\", and she accompanied Charles on visits to &lt;a href=\"Balmoral%20Castle\"&gt;Balmoral Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sandringham%20House\"&gt;Sandringham House&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharles's cousin &lt;a href=\"Norton%20Knatchbull%2C%208th%20Baron%20Brabourne\"&gt;Norton Knatchbull&lt;/a&gt; and his wife told Charles that Diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her. Meanwhile, the couple's continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and &lt;a href=\"paparazzi\"&gt;paparazzi&lt;/a&gt;. When Prince Philip told him that the media speculation would injure Diana's reputation if Charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon, and realising that she was a suitable royal bride (according to Mountbatten's criteria), Charles construed his father's advice as a warning to proceed without further delay.\nPrince Charles proposed to Diana in February 1981; she accepted and they married in &lt;a href=\"St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral\"&gt;St Paul's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; on 29 July of that year. Upon his marriage, Charles reduced his voluntary tax contribution from the profits generated by the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Cornwall\"&gt;Duchy of Cornwall&lt;/a&gt; from 50% to 25%. The couple lived at &lt;a href=\"Kensington%20Palace\"&gt;Kensington Palace&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Highgrove%20House\"&gt;Highgrove House&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Tetbury\"&gt;Tetbury&lt;/a&gt;, and had two children: Princes &lt;a href=\"Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;William&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1982) and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Harry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Sussex\"&gt;Henry&lt;/a&gt; (known as \"Harry\") (b. 1984). Charles set a precedent by being the first royal father to be present at his children's births.\nWithin five years, the marriage was in trouble due to the couple's incompatibility and near 13-year age difference. In a videotape recorded by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Settelen\"&gt;Peter Settelen&lt;/a&gt; in 1992, Diana admitted that by 1986, she had been \"deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment.\" It is thought she was referring to &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Mannakee\"&gt;Barry Mannakee&lt;/a&gt;, who was transferred to the Diplomatic Protection Squad in 1986 after his managers had determined that his relationship with Diana had been inappropriate. Diana later commenced a relationship with Major &lt;a href=\"James%20Hewitt\"&gt;James Hewitt&lt;/a&gt;, the family's former riding instructor. Charles and Diana's evident discomfort in each other's company led to them being dubbed \"The Glums\" by the press. Diana exposed Charles's affair with Camilla in a book by Andrew Morton, \"Diana, Her True Story\". Audio tapes of her own extramarital flirtations also surfaced. Persistent suggestions that Hewitt is Prince Harry's father have been based on a physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry. However, Harry had already been born by the time Diana's affair with Hewitt began.\nLegal separation and divorce.\nIn December 1992, British Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"John%20Major\"&gt;John Major&lt;/a&gt; announced the couple's &lt;a href=\"legal%20separation\"&gt;legal separation&lt;/a&gt; in Parliament. Earlier that year, the British press had published transcripts of a passionate bugged telephone conversation between Charles and Camilla from 1989, which was dubbed Camillagate by the press. Prince Charles sought public understanding in a television film, \"\", with &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Dimbleby\"&gt;Jonathan Dimbleby&lt;/a&gt; that was broadcast on 29 June 1994. In an interview in the film, he confirmed his own extramarital affair with Camilla, saying that he had rekindled their association in 1986 only after his marriage to Diana had \"irretrievably broken down\". Charles and Diana divorced on 28 August 1996. Diana was &lt;a href=\"Death%20of%20Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales\"&gt;killed in a car crash&lt;/a&gt; in Paris on 31 August of the following year; Charles flew to Paris with Diana's sisters to accompany her body back to Britain.\nMarriage to Camilla Parker Bowles.\nThe engagement of Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles was announced on 10 February 2005; he presented her with an engagement ring that had belonged to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother\"&gt;his grandmother&lt;/a&gt;. The Queen's consent to the marriage (as required by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Marriages%20Act%201772\"&gt;Royal Marriages Act 1772&lt;/a&gt;) was recorded in a &lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Honourable%20Privy%20Council\"&gt;Privy Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting on 2 March. In Canada, the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Justice%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; announced its decision that the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Privy%20Council%20for%20Canada\"&gt;Queen's Privy Council for Canada&lt;/a&gt; was not required to meet to give its consent to the marriage, as the union would not result in offspring and would have no impact on the succession to the &lt;a href=\"Monarchy%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Canadian throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharles was the only member of the royal family to have a &lt;a href=\"civil%20marriage\"&gt;civil&lt;/a&gt; rather than a church wedding in England. Government documents from the 1950s and 1960s, published by the BBC, stated that such a marriage was illegal, though these were dismissed by Charles's spokesman, and explained to be obsolete by the sitting government.\nThe marriage was scheduled to take place in a civil ceremony at &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Castle\"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt;, with a subsequent religious blessing at &lt;a href=\"St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle\"&gt;St George's Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. The venue was subsequently changed to &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Guildhall\"&gt;Windsor Guildhall&lt;/a&gt;, because a civil marriage at Windsor Castle would oblige the venue to be available to anyone who wished to be married there. Four days before the wedding, it was postponed from the originally scheduled date of 8\u00a0April until the following day in order to allow Charles and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the &lt;a href=\"funeral%20of%20Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;funeral of Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharles's parents did not attend the civil marriage ceremony; the Queen's reluctance to attend possibly arose from her position as &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Governor%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Supreme Governor of the Church of England&lt;/a&gt;. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh did attend the &lt;a href=\"service%20of%20worship\"&gt;service&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"blessing\"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt; and later held a reception for the newlyweds at Windsor Castle. The blessing, by the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rowan%20Williams\"&gt;Rowan Williams&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle\"&gt;St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt;, was televised.\nSocial interests.\nPhilanthropy and charity.\nSince founding &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Trust\"&gt;The Prince's Trust&lt;/a&gt; in 1976, Charles has established 16 more charitable organisations, and now serves as president of all of those. Together, these form a loose alliance called &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Charities\"&gt;The Prince's Charities&lt;/a&gt;, which describes itself as \"the largest multi-cause charitable enterprise in the United Kingdom, raising over \u00a3100 million annually\u00a0... [and is] active across a broad range of areas including education and young people, environmental sustainability, the built environment, responsible business and enterprise and international.\"\nIn 2010, &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Charities%23The%20Prince%27s%20Trust%20Canada%20%28formerly%20The%20Prince%27s%20Charities%20Canada%29\"&gt;The Prince's Charities Canada&lt;/a&gt; was established in a similar fashion to its namesake in the UK. Charles is also &lt;a href=\"patron\"&gt;patron&lt;/a&gt; of over 400 other charities and organisations. He uses &lt;a href=\"Royal%20tours%20of%20Canada\"&gt;his tours&lt;/a&gt; of Canada as a way to help draw attention to youth, the disabled, the environment, the arts, medicine, the elderly, heritage conservation, and education. In Canada, Charles has supported humanitarian projects. Along with his two sons, he took part in ceremonies that marked the 1998 &lt;a href=\"International%20Day%20for%20the%20Elimination%20of%20Racial%20Discrimination\"&gt;International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. Charles has also set up &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Charities%23The%20Prince%27s%20Trust%20Canada%20%28formerly%20The%20Prince%27s%20Charities%20Canada%29\"&gt;The Prince's Charities Australia&lt;/a&gt;, which is based in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Melbourne, Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. The Prince's Charities Australia is to provide a coordinating presence for the Prince of Wales's Australian and international charitable endeavours\nCharles was one of the first world leaders to express strong concerns about the human rights record of Romanian dictator &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Ceau%C8%99escu\"&gt;Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu&lt;/a&gt;, initiating objections in the international arena, and subsequently supported the FARA Foundation, a charity for Romanian orphans and abandoned children.\nIn 2013, Charles donated an unspecified sum of money to the British Red Cross Syria Crisis appeal and DEC Syria appeal, which is run by 14 British charities to help victims of the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20civil%20war\"&gt;Syrian civil war&lt;/a&gt;. According to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", It is believed that after turning 65 years old in 2013, Charles donated his state pension to an unnamed charity that supports elderly people. In March 2014, Charles arranged for five million measles-rubella vaccinations for children in the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak of measles in South-East Asia. According to Clarence House, Charles was affected by news of the damage caused by &lt;a href=\"Typhoon%20Yolanda\"&gt;Typhoon Yolanda&lt;/a&gt; in 2013. International Health Partners, of which he has been Patron since 2004, sent the vaccines, which are believed to protect five million children below the age of five from &lt;a href=\"measles\"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn January 2020, the Prince of Wales became the first British patron of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Rescue%20Committee\"&gt;International Rescue Committee&lt;/a&gt;, a charity which aims to help refugees and those displaced by war, persecution, or natural disaster. In April 2021 and following a surge in &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20India\"&gt;COVID-19 cases in India&lt;/a&gt;, Charles issued a statement, announcing the launch of an emergency appeal for India by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Asian%20Trust\"&gt;British Asian Trust&lt;/a&gt;, of which he is the founder. The appeal, called Oxygen for India, helped with buying oxygen concentrators for hospitals in need.\nIn January 2022, Charles commissioned seven artists to paint portraits of seven &lt;a href=\"Holocaust\"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; survivors. The paintings are set to be exhibited at the Queen's Gallery in Buckingham Palace and at the Palace of Holyroodhouse and will be featured in a &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Two\"&gt;BBC Two&lt;/a&gt; documentary titled \"Survivors: Portraits of the Holocaust\".\nBuilt environment.\nThe Prince of Wales has openly expressed his views on architecture and &lt;a href=\"urban%20planning\"&gt;urban planning&lt;/a&gt;; he fostered the advancement of &lt;a href=\"New%20Classical%20Architecture\"&gt;New Classical Architecture&lt;/a&gt; and asserted that he \"care[s] deeply about issues such as the environment, architecture, inner-city renewal, and the quality of life.\" In a speech given for the 150th anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects\"&gt;Royal Institute of British Architects&lt;/a&gt; (RIBA) on 30 May 1984, he memorably described a proposed extension to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery%20%28London%29\"&gt;National Gallery in London&lt;/a&gt; as a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend\" and deplored the \"glass stumps and concrete towers\" of modern architecture. He asserted that \"it is possible, and important in human terms, to respect old buildings, street plans and traditional scales and at the same time not to feel guilty about a preference for facades, ornaments and soft materials,\" called for local community involvement in architectural choices, and asked: \nHis book and BBC documentary \"A Vision of Britain\" (1987) was also critical of modern architecture, and he has continued to campaign for traditional urbanism, human scale, restoration of historic buildings, and sustainable design, despite criticism in the press. Two of his charities (&lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Regeneration%20Trust\"&gt;The Prince's Regeneration Trust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Foundation%20for%20Building%20Community\"&gt;The Prince's Foundation for Building Community&lt;/a&gt;, which were later merged into one charity) promote his views, and the village of &lt;a href=\"Poundbury\"&gt;Poundbury&lt;/a&gt; was built on land owned by the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Cornwall\"&gt;Duchy of Cornwall&lt;/a&gt; to a master plan by &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9on%20Krier\"&gt;L\u00e9on Krier&lt;/a&gt; under the guidance of Prince Charles and in line with his philosophy.\nCharles helped establish a national trust for the built environment in Canada after lamenting, in 1996, the unbridled destruction of many of the country's historic urban cores. He offered his assistance to the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Canadian%20Heritage\"&gt;Department of Canadian Heritage&lt;/a&gt; in creating a trust modelled on Britain's &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;National Trust&lt;/a&gt;, a plan that was implemented with the passage of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Canadian%20federal%20budget\"&gt;2007 Canadian federal budget&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999, the Prince agreed to the use of his title for the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Wales%20Prize%20for%20Municipal%20Heritage%20Leadership\"&gt;Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership&lt;/a&gt;, awarded by the &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20Canada\"&gt;Heritage Canada&lt;/a&gt; Foundation to municipal governments that have shown sustained commitment to the conservation of historic places. While visiting the United States and surveying the damage caused by &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Katrina\"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, Charles received the &lt;a href=\"National%20Building%20Museum\"&gt;National Building Museum&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Scully%20Prize\"&gt;Vincent Scully Prize&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, for his efforts in regard to architecture; he donated $25,000 of the prize money towards restoring storm-damaged communities.\nFrom 1997, the Prince of Wales has visited &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; to view and highlight the destruction of Orthodox monasteries and &lt;a href=\"Transylvanian%20Saxons\"&gt;Transylvanian Saxon&lt;/a&gt; villages during the &lt;a href=\"Romania%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; rule of &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Ceau%C8%99escu\"&gt;Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu&lt;/a&gt;. Charles is patron of the &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Eminescu\"&gt;Mihai Eminescu&lt;/a&gt; Trust, a Romanian conservation and regeneration organisation, and has purchased a house in Romania. Historian &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Gerard%20Gallagher\"&gt;Tom Gallagher&lt;/a&gt; wrote in the Romanian newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Rom%C3%A2nia%20Liber%C4%83\"&gt;Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2006 that Charles had been offered the Romanian throne by monarchists in that country; an offer that was reportedly turned down, but Buckingham Palace denied the reports. Charles also has \"a deep understanding of &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20art\"&gt;Islamic art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;\", and has been involved in the construction of a building and garden at the &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20Centre%20for%20Islamic%20Studies\"&gt;Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies&lt;/a&gt; that combine Islamic and Oxford architectural styles.\nCharles has occasionally intervened in projects that employ architectural styles such as &lt;a href=\"modernism\"&gt;modernism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Functionalism%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;functionalism&lt;/a&gt;. In 2009, Charles wrote to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Thani\"&gt;Qatari royal family&lt;/a&gt;, the developers of the &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20Barracks\"&gt;Chelsea Barracks&lt;/a&gt; site, labelling &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Rogers\"&gt;Lord Rogers&lt;/a&gt;'s design for the site \"unsuitable\". Subsequently, Rogers was removed from the project and The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment was appointed to propose an alternative. Rogers claimed the Prince had also intervened to block his designs for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Royal Opera House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paternoster%20Square\"&gt;Paternoster Square&lt;/a&gt;, and condemned Charles's actions as \"an abuse of power\" and \"unconstitutional\". &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Foster%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Lord Foster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zaha%20Hadid\"&gt;Zaha Hadid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Herzog\"&gt;Jacques Herzog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Nouvel\"&gt;Jean Nouvel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renzo%20Piano\"&gt;Renzo Piano&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Gehry\"&gt;Frank Gehry&lt;/a&gt;, among others, wrote a letter to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sunday%20Times\"&gt;The Sunday Times&lt;/a&gt;\" complaining that the Prince's \"private comments\" and \"behind-the-scenes lobbying\" subverted the \"open and democratic planning process\". &lt;a href=\"Piers%20Gough\"&gt;Piers Gough&lt;/a&gt; and other architects condemned Charles's views as \"elitist\" in a letter encouraging colleagues to boycott a speech given by Charles to RIBA in 2009.\nIn 2010, &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Foundation%20for%20the%20Built%20Environment\"&gt;The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment&lt;/a&gt; decided to help reconstruct and redesign buildings in &lt;a href=\"Port-au-Prince\"&gt;Port-au-Prince&lt;/a&gt;, Haiti after the capital was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Haiti%20earthquake\"&gt;2010 Haiti earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. The foundation is known for refurbishing historic buildings in &lt;a href=\"Kabul\"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;, Afghanistan and in &lt;a href=\"Kingston%2C%20Jamaica\"&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt;, Jamaica. The project has been called the \"biggest challenge yet\" for the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment. For his work as patron of &lt;a href=\"New%20Classical%20Architecture\"&gt;New Classical Architecture&lt;/a&gt;, in 2012 he was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Driehaus%20Architecture%20Prize\"&gt;Driehaus Architecture Prize&lt;/a&gt; for patronage. The prize, awarded by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Notre%20Dame\"&gt;University of Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;, is considered the highest architecture award for New Classical Architecture and urban planning.\nLivery company commitments.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Carpenters\"&gt;Worshipful Company of Carpenters&lt;/a&gt; installed Charles as an Honorary Liveryman \"in recognition of his interest in London's architecture.\" The Prince of Wales is also Permanent Master of the &lt;a href=\"Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Shipwrights\"&gt;Worshipful Company of Shipwrights&lt;/a&gt;, a Freeman of the &lt;a href=\"Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Drapers\"&gt;Worshipful Company of Drapers&lt;/a&gt;, an Honorary Freeman of the &lt;a href=\"Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Musicians\"&gt;Worshipful Company of Musicians&lt;/a&gt;, an Honorary Member of the Court of Assistants of the &lt;a href=\"Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Goldsmiths\"&gt;Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths&lt;/a&gt;, and a Royal Liveryman of the &lt;a href=\"Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Gardeners\"&gt;Worshipful Company of Gardeners&lt;/a&gt;.\nNatural environment.\nSince the 1970s, Charles has promoted environmental awareness. In order to decrease his &lt;a href=\"carbon%20footprint\"&gt;carbon footprint&lt;/a&gt;, he has used &lt;a href=\"biomass%20boiler\"&gt;biomass boiler&lt;/a&gt;s for heating Birkhall, where has also installed a hydroelectric turbine in the river beside the estate. He has utilised solar panels at Clarence House and Highgrove, and \u2013 besides using &lt;a href=\"electric%20car\"&gt;electric car&lt;/a&gt;s on his estates \u2013 runs his &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Martin%20DB6\"&gt;Aston Martin DB6&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"E85\"&gt;E85&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon moving into &lt;a href=\"Highgrove%20House\"&gt;Highgrove House&lt;/a&gt;, Charles developed an interest in &lt;a href=\"organic%20farming\"&gt;organic farming&lt;/a&gt;, which culminated in the 1990 launch of his own organic brand, &lt;a href=\"Waitrose%20Duchy%20Organic\"&gt;Duchy Originals&lt;/a&gt;, which now sells more than 200 different sustainably produced products, from food to garden furniture; the profits (over \u00a36\u00a0million by 2010) are donated to The Prince's Charities. Documenting work on his estate, Charles co-authored (with Charles Clover, environment editor of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\") \"Highgrove: An Experiment in Organic Gardening and Farming\", published in 1993, and offers his patronage to &lt;a href=\"Garden%20Organic\"&gt;Garden Organic&lt;/a&gt;. Along similar lines, the Prince of Wales became involved with farming and various industries within it, regularly meeting with farmers to discuss their trade. Although the &lt;a href=\"2001%20United%20Kingdom%20foot-and-mouth%20outbreak\"&gt;2001 foot-and-mouth&lt;/a&gt; epidemic in England prevented Charles from visiting organic farms in &lt;a href=\"Saskatchewan\"&gt;Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt;, he met the farmers at &lt;a href=\"Assiniboia%2C%20Saskatchewan\"&gt;Assiniboia&lt;/a&gt; town hall. In 2004, he founded the &lt;a href=\"Mutton%20Renaissance%20Campaign\"&gt;Mutton Renaissance Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to support British sheep farmers and make &lt;a href=\"mutton\"&gt;mutton&lt;/a&gt; more attractive to Britons. His organic farming has attracted media criticism: According to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Independent\"&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;\" in October 2006, \"the story of Duchy Originals has involved compromises and ethical blips, wedded to a determined merchandising programme.\"\nIn 2007, he received the 10th annual &lt;a href=\"Global%20Environmental%20Citizen%20Award\"&gt;Global Environmental Citizen Award&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Medical%20School\"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;'s Center for Health and the Global Environment, the director of which, &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Chivian\"&gt;Eric Chivian&lt;/a&gt;, stated: \"For decades the Prince of Wales has been a champion of the natural world\u00a0... He has been a world leader in efforts to improve energy efficiency and in reducing the discharge of toxic substances on land, and into the air and the oceans\". Charles's travels by private jet drew criticism from &lt;a href=\"Plane%20Stupid\"&gt;Plane Stupid&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Joss%20Garman\"&gt;Joss Garman&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2007, Charles launched &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20May%20Day%20Network\"&gt;The Prince's May Day Network&lt;/a&gt;, which encourages businesses to take action on &lt;a href=\"climate%20change\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking to the &lt;a href=\"European%20Parliament\"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; on 14 February 2008, he called for European Union leadership in the war against climate change. During the standing ovation that followed, &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Farage\"&gt;Nigel Farage&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Independence%20Party\"&gt;United Kingdom Independence Party&lt;/a&gt; (UKIP), remained seated and went on to describe Charles's advisers as \"naive and foolish at best.\" In a speech to the Low Carbon Prosperity Summit in a European Parliament chamber on 9 February 2011, Charles said that climate change sceptics are playing \"a reckless game of roulette\" with the planet's future and are having a \"corrosive effect\" on public opinion. He also articulated the need to protect fisheries and the Amazon rain forest, and to make low-carbon emissions affordable and competitive.\nIn 2011, Charles received the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds%23RSPB%20Medal\"&gt;Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Medal&lt;/a&gt; for his engagement with the environment, such as the &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20rainforest%20conservation\"&gt;conservation of rainforests&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 27 August 2012, the Prince of Wales addressed the International Union for Conservation of Nature \u2013 World Conservation Congress, supporting the view that grazing animals are needed to keep soils and grassland productive:\nI have been particularly fascinated, for example, by the work of a remarkable man called &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Savory\"&gt;Allan Savory&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"semi%20arid\"&gt;semi arid&lt;/a&gt; areas, who has argued for years against the prevailing expert view that is the simple numbers of cattle that drive overgrazing and cause fertile land to become desert. On the contrary, as he has since shown so graphically, the land needs the presence of feeding animals and their droppings for the cycle to be complete, so that soils and grassland areas stay productive. Such that, if you take grazers off the land and lock them away in vast &lt;a href=\"feedlots\"&gt;feedlots&lt;/a&gt;, the land dies.\nIn February 2014, Charles visited the &lt;a href=\"Somerset%20levels\"&gt;Somerset levels&lt;/a&gt; to meet residents affected by &lt;a href=\"Winter%20flooding%20of%202013%E2%80%9314%20on%20the%20Somerset%20Levels\"&gt;winter flooding&lt;/a&gt;. During his visit, Charles remarked that \"There's nothing like a jolly good disaster to get people to start doing something. The tragedy is that nothing happened for so long.\" He pledged a \u00a350,000 donation, provided by the Prince's Countryside Fund, to help families and businesses. In December 2015, Charles delivered a speech at the opening ceremony for &lt;a href=\"COP21\"&gt;COP21&lt;/a&gt;, making a plea to industries to put an end to practices that cause &lt;a href=\"deforestation\"&gt;deforestation&lt;/a&gt;. In August 2019, it was announced that the Prince of Wales had collaborated with British fashion designers Vin and Omi to produce a line of clothing made out of &lt;a href=\"Urtica%20dioica\"&gt;nettles&lt;/a&gt; found in his Highgrove estate. Nettles are a type of plants which are usually \"perceived to have no value\". The Highgrove plant waste was also used to create the jewellery worn with the dresses. In September 2020, the Prince of Wales launched RE:TV, an online platform featuring short films and articles on issues such as climate change and sustainability. He serves as the platform's editor-in-chief. The platform later partnered with &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Prime%20Video\"&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt; and WaterBear, another streaming platform dedicated to environmental issues. In the same month, he stated in a speech that a military-style response similar to the &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Plan\"&gt;Marshall Plan&lt;/a&gt; was required to combat climate change.\nIn January 2020, Chares launched the Sustainable Markets Initiative at the &lt;a href=\"World%20Economic%20Forum\"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt;'s annual meeting in &lt;a href=\"Davos\"&gt;Davos&lt;/a&gt;, a project which encourages putting &lt;a href=\"sustainability\"&gt;sustainability&lt;/a&gt; at the centre of all activities. In May 2020, the Prince of Wales's Sustainable Markets Initiative and the World Economic Forum launched the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Reset\"&gt;Great Reset&lt;/a&gt; project, a five-point plan concerned with enhancing sustainable economic growth following the global recession caused by the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. In January 2021, Charles launched Terra Carta (\"Earth Charter\"), a &lt;a href=\"sustainable%20finance\"&gt;sustainable finance&lt;/a&gt; charter that would ask its signatories to follow a set of rules towards becoming more sustainable and make investments in projects and causes that help with preserving the environment. In July 2021, Charles and &lt;a href=\"Jony%20Ive\"&gt;Jony Ive&lt;/a&gt; announced the Terra Carta Design Lab, a competition conceived by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20College%20of%20Art\"&gt;Royal College of Art&lt;/a&gt; to find solutions to climate change and environmental issues, winners of which would be supported financially and introduced to the industry leads of the Sustainable Markets Initiative. In September 2021, he launched the Food for the Future initiative, a programme with contributions from &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Doherty\"&gt;Jimmy Doherty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Oliver\"&gt;Jamie Oliver&lt;/a&gt; which aims to educate secondary school children about the &lt;a href=\"food%20system\"&gt;food system&lt;/a&gt; and eliminating food waste. In his role as patron of the National Hedgelaying Society, Charles has hosted receptions for the organisation's rural competition at his Highgrove estate to assist with preserving &lt;a href=\"hedgerows\"&gt;hedgerows&lt;/a&gt; planted in the UK.\nIn June 2021, he attended a reception hosted by the Queen during the &lt;a href=\"47th%20G7%20summit\"&gt;47th G7 summit&lt;/a&gt;, and a meeting beween G7 leaders and sustainable industry CEOs to discuss governmental and corporate solutions to environmental problems. In October 2021, he delivered a speech at the &lt;a href=\"2021%20G20%20Rome%20summit\"&gt;2021 G20 Rome summit&lt;/a&gt;, describing &lt;a href=\"COP26\"&gt;COP26&lt;/a&gt; as \"the last chance saloon\" for preventing climate change and asking for actions that would lead to a green-led sustainable economy. In his speech at the opening ceremony for COP26, he repeated his sentiments from the previous year, stating that a \"a vast military-style campaign\" was needed \"to marshal the strength of the global private sector\" for tackling climate change. In 2021, Prince Charles spoke to the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; about the environment and said two days a week he eats no meat nor fish and one day a week he eats no dairy products.\nAlternative medicine.\nCharles has controversially championed &lt;a href=\"alternative%20medicine\"&gt;alternative medicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Foundation%20for%20Integrated%20Health\"&gt;The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health&lt;/a&gt; attracted opposition from the scientific and medical community over its campaign encouraging &lt;a href=\"general%20practitioner\"&gt;general practitioner&lt;/a&gt;s to offer herbal and other alternative treatments to &lt;a href=\"National%20Health%20Service\"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt; patients, and in May 2006, Charles made a speech at the &lt;a href=\"World%20Health%20Assembly\"&gt;World Health Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in Geneva, urging the integration of conventional and alternative medicine and arguing for &lt;a href=\"homeopathy\"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn April 2008, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times\"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;\" published a letter from &lt;a href=\"Edzard%20Ernst\"&gt;Edzard Ernst&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter, which asked the Prince's Foundation to recall two guides promoting alternative medicine, saying \"the majority of alternative therapies appear to be clinically ineffective, and many are downright dangerous.\" A speaker for the foundation countered the criticism by stating: \"We entirely reject the accusation that our online publication \"Complementary Healthcare: A Guide\" contains any misleading or inaccurate claims about the benefits of complementary therapies. On the contrary, it treats people as adults and takes a responsible approach by encouraging people to look at reliable sources of information\u00a0... so that they can make informed decisions. The foundation does not promote complementary therapies.\" That year, Ernst published a book with &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Singh\"&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt;, mockingly dedicated to \"HRH the Prince of Wales\", called \"&lt;a href=\"Trick%20or%20Treatment\"&gt;Trick or Treatment: Alternative Medicine on Trial&lt;/a&gt;\". The last chapter is highly critical of Charles's advocacy of complementary and alternative treatments.\nThe Prince's &lt;a href=\"Waitrose%20Duchy%20Organic\"&gt;Duchy Originals&lt;/a&gt; produce a variety of complementary medicinal products including a \"Detox Tincture\" that Edzard Ernst has denounced as \"financially exploiting the vulnerable\" and \"outright &lt;a href=\"quackery\"&gt;quackery&lt;/a&gt;\". In 2009, the &lt;a href=\"Advertising%20Standards%20Authority%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Advertising Standards Authority&lt;/a&gt; criticised an email that Duchy Originals had sent out to advertise its Echina-Relief, Hyperi-Lift and Detox Tinctures products saying that it was misleading. The Prince personally wrote at least seven letters to the &lt;a href=\"Medicines%20and%20Healthcare%20products%20Regulatory%20Agency\"&gt;Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&lt;/a&gt; (MHRA) shortly before they relaxed the rules governing labelling of such herbal products, a move that has been widely condemned by scientists and medical bodies. In October 2009, it was reported that Charles had personally lobbied the Health Secretary, &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Burnham\"&gt;Andy Burnham&lt;/a&gt;, regarding greater provision of alternative treatments in the NHS. In 2016, Charles said in a speech that he used &lt;a href=\"homeopathy\"&gt;homeopathic&lt;/a&gt; veterinary medicines to reduce antibiotic use at his farm.\nIn April 2010, following accounting irregularities, a former official at the Prince's Foundation and his wife were arrested for fraud believed to total \u00a3300,000. Four days later, the foundation announced its closure, claiming that it \"has achieved its key objective of promoting the use of integrated health.\" The charity's finance director, accountant George Gray, was convicted of theft totalling \u00a3253,000 and sentenced to three years in prison. The Prince's Foundation was re-branded and re-launched later in 2010 as &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Medicine%20%28UK%29\"&gt;The College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligious and philosophical interests.\nPrince Charles was &lt;a href=\"confirmation\"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; at age 16 by Archbishop of Canterbury &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Ramsey\"&gt;Michael Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; at Easter 1965, in &lt;a href=\"St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle\"&gt;St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt;. He attends services at various &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; churches close to Highgrove, and attends the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Church of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Crathie%20Kirk\"&gt;Crathie Kirk&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of the royal family when staying at Balmoral Castle. In 2000, he was appointed as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20High%20Commissioner%20to%20the%20General%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. Charles has visited (amid some secrecy) &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; monasteries several times on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Athos\"&gt;Mount Athos&lt;/a&gt; as well as in Romania. Charles is also patron of the &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20Centre%20for%20Islamic%20Studies\"&gt;Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, and in the 2000s, he inaugurated the &lt;a href=\"Markfield%20Institute%20of%20Higher%20Education\"&gt;Markfield Institute of Higher Education&lt;/a&gt;, which is dedicated to Islamic studies in a plural multicultural context.\nSir &lt;a href=\"Laurens%20van%20der%20Post\"&gt;Laurens van der Post&lt;/a&gt; became a friend of Charles in 1977; he was dubbed his \"spiritual guru\" and was godfather to Charles's son, Prince William. From van der Post, Prince Charles developed a focus on philosophy and interest in other religions. Charles expressed his philosophical views in his 2010 book, \"\", which won a Nautilus Book Award. In November 2016, he attended the consecration of &lt;a href=\"St%20Thomas%20Cathedral%2C%20Acton\"&gt;St Thomas Cathedral, Acton&lt;/a&gt;, to be Britain's first &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Syriac Orthodox Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. In October 2019, he attended the canonisation of &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Newman\"&gt;Cardinal Newman&lt;/a&gt;. Charles visited Eastern Church leaders in Jerusalem in January 2020 culminating in an ecumenical service in the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Nativity\"&gt;Church of the Nativity&lt;/a&gt; in Bethlehem, after which he walked through that city accompanied by Christian and Muslim dignitaries.\nAlthough it had been rumoured that Charles would vow to be \"Defender of the Faiths\" or \"Defender of Faith\" as king, he stated in 2015 that he would retain the monarch's traditional title of \"&lt;a href=\"Fidei%20defensor\"&gt;Defender of the Faith&lt;/a&gt;\", whilst \"ensuring that other people's faiths can also be practised\", which he sees as a duty of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt;.\nHobbies and personal interests.\nSports.\nFrom his youth until 1992, Prince Charles was an avid player of competitive &lt;a href=\"polo\"&gt;polo&lt;/a&gt;. He continued to play informally, including for charity, until 2005. Charles also frequently took part in &lt;a href=\"fox%20hunting\"&gt;fox hunting&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Act%202004\"&gt;the sport was banned in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. By the late 1990s, opposition to the activity was growing when Charles's participation was viewed as a \"political statement\" by those who were opposed to it. The &lt;a href=\"League%20Against%20Cruel%20Sports\"&gt;League Against Cruel Sports&lt;/a&gt; launched an attack against Charles after he took his sons on the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Beaufort%27s%20Hunt\"&gt;Beaufort Hunt&lt;/a&gt; in 1999. At that time, the government was trying to ban hunting with hounds.\nCharles has been a keen salmon angler since youth and supports &lt;a href=\"Orri%20Vigf%C3%BAsson\"&gt;Orri Vigf\u00fasson&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts to protect the North Atlantic salmon. He frequently fishes the &lt;a href=\"River%20Dee%2C%20Aberdeenshire\"&gt;River Dee&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aberdeenshire\"&gt;Aberdeenshire&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland, while he claims his most special angling memories are from his time in &lt;a href=\"Vopnafj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur\"&gt;Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur&lt;/a&gt;, Iceland. Charles is a supporter of &lt;a href=\"Burnley%20F.C.\"&gt;Burnley Football Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nVisual, performing and contemporary arts.\nPrince Charles is president or patron of more than 20 performing arts organisations, which include the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20College%20of%20Music\"&gt;Royal College of Music&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Royal%20Opera\"&gt;Royal Opera&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"English%20Chamber%20Orchestra\"&gt;English Chamber Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Philharmonia%20Orchestra\"&gt;Philharmonia Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20National%20Opera\"&gt;Welsh National Opera&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Purcell%20School\"&gt;Purcell School&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2000, he revived the tradition of appointing harpists to the Royal Court, by appointing an &lt;a href=\"Official%20Harpist%20to%20the%20Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Official Harpist to the Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt;. As an undergraduate at Cambridge he played cello, and has sung with the &lt;a href=\"Bach%20Choir\"&gt;Bach Choir&lt;/a&gt; twice.\nCharles founded &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Foundation%20for%20Children%20and%20The%20Arts\"&gt;The Prince's Foundation for Children and The Arts&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, to help more children experience the arts first-hand. He is president of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company\"&gt;Royal Shakespeare Company&lt;/a&gt; and attends performances in &lt;a href=\"Stratford-Upon-Avon\"&gt;Stratford-Upon-Avon&lt;/a&gt;, supports fundraising events and attends the company's annual general meeting. He enjoys comedy, and is interested in &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28illusion%29\"&gt;illusionism&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Magic%20Circle%20%28organisation%29\"&gt;The Magic Circle&lt;/a&gt; after passing his audition in 1975 by performing the \"&lt;a href=\"cups%20and%20balls\"&gt;cups and balls&lt;/a&gt;\" effect. Charles has also been patron of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Film%20Institute\"&gt;British Film Institute&lt;/a&gt; since 1978.\nCharles is a keen and accomplished &lt;a href=\"watercolour\"&gt;watercolour&lt;/a&gt;ist who has exhibited and sold a number of his works to raise money for his charities and also published books on the subject. To mark the 25th anniversary of his investiture as the Prince of Wales in 1994, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Mail\"&gt;Royal Mail&lt;/a&gt; issued a series of postage stamps which featured his paintings. For his 50th birthday, 50 of his watercolours were exhibited at &lt;a href=\"Hampton%20Court%20Palace\"&gt;Hampton Court Palace&lt;/a&gt;. In 2001, 20 &lt;a href=\"lithographs\"&gt;lithographs&lt;/a&gt; of his watercolour paintings illustrating his country estates were exhibited at the &lt;a href=\"Florence%20Biennale\"&gt;Florence International Biennale of Contemporary Art&lt;/a&gt;. In 2016, it was estimated that he had sold lithographs of his watercolours for a total of \u00a32 million from a shop at his Highgrove House residence. For his 70th birthday in 2018, his works were exhibited at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Gallery of Australia&lt;/a&gt;. In 2022, 79 of his paintings were put on display in London. He is Honorary President of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Academy\"&gt;Royal Academy&lt;/a&gt; of Arts Development Trust.\nCharles was awarded the 2011 Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award by the Montblanc Cultural Foundation for his support and commitment to the arts, particularly in regard to young people.\nOn 23 April 2016, Charles appeared in a comedy sketch for the Royal Shakespeare Company's \"Shakespeare Live!\" at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company%23Theatres\"&gt;Royal Shakespeare Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;'s death in 1616. The event was televised live by the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. Charles made a surprise entrance to settle the disputed delivery of &lt;a href=\"Hamlet%20%28play%29\"&gt;Hamlet's&lt;/a&gt; celebrated line, \"To be or not to be, that is the question\".\nPublications.\nPrince Charles is an author of several books that reflect his own interests. He has also contributed a &lt;a href=\"foreword\"&gt;foreword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"preface\"&gt;preface&lt;/a&gt; to books by other writers and has also written, presented and has been featured in documentary films.\nMedia image.\nSince his birth, Prince Charles has received close media attention, which increased as he matured. It has been an ambivalent relationship, largely impacted by his marriages to Diana and Camilla and its aftermath, but also centred on his future conduct as king, such as the 2014 play \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Charles%20III%20%28play%29\"&gt;King Charles III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescribed as the \"&lt;a href=\"Eligible%20bachelor\"&gt;world's most eligible bachelor&lt;/a&gt;\" in the late 1970s, Prince Charles was subsequently overshadowed by Diana. After her death, the media regularly breached Charles's privacy and printed expos\u00e9s. In 2003, Diana's butler &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Burrell\"&gt;Paul Burrell&lt;/a&gt; published a note that he claimed had been written by Diana in 1995, in which there were allegations that Charles was \"planning 'an accident' in [Diana's] car, brake failure and serious head injury\" so that he could marry again. When questioned by the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Police\"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; inquiry team as a part of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Paget\"&gt;Operation Paget&lt;/a&gt;, Charles told the authorities that he did not know about his former wife's note from 1995 and could not understand why she had these feelings.\nIn 2006, the prince filed a court case against the \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Mail\"&gt;Mail on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;\", after excerpts of his personal journals were published, revealing his opinions on matters such as the &lt;a href=\"transfer%20of%20sovereignty%20of%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; to China in 1997, in which Charles described the Chinese government officials as \"appalling old waxworks\". &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Bolland\"&gt;Mark Bolland&lt;/a&gt;, his ex-private secretary, declared in a statement to the High Court that Charles \"would readily embrace the political aspects of any contentious issue he was interested in\u00a0... He carried it out in a very considered, thoughtful and researched way. He often referred to himself as a 'dissident' working against the prevailing political consensus.\" &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Dimbleby\"&gt;Jonathan Dimbleby&lt;/a&gt; reported that the prince \"has accumulated a number of certainties about the state of the world and does not relish contradiction.\"\nOther people who were formerly connected with the prince have betrayed his confidence. An ex-member of his household handed the press an internal memo in which Charles commented on ambition and opportunity, and which was widely interpreted as blaming meritocracy for creating a combative atmosphere in society. Charles responded: \"In my view, it is just as great an achievement to be a plumber or a bricklayer as it is to be a lawyer or a doctor\".\nIn 2012, Charles met backlash for his long-standing association with &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Savile\"&gt;Jimmy Savile&lt;/a&gt;, who was accused of hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse after his death in 2011. Charles met Savile through mutual charity interests, and later consulted him as a confidant and adviser. His work with &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20Mandeville%20Hospital\"&gt;Stoke Mandeville Hospital&lt;/a&gt; also made Savile a suitable figure to whom the prince could turn \"for advice on navigating Britain's health authorities\". &lt;a href=\"Dickie%20Arbiter\"&gt;Dickie Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, the spokesman for the Queen between 1988 and 2000, said that during his regular visits to Charles's office at St James's Palace, Savile would \"do the rounds of the young ladies taking their hands and rubbing his lips all the way up their arms\", though no record of any assistants making a complaint exists. Charles met Savile on several occasions. In 1999, he visited Savile's &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Coe\"&gt;Glen Coe&lt;/a&gt; home for a private meal. He reportedly sent him gifts on his 80th birthday and a note reading: \"Nobody will ever know what you have done for this country, Jimmy. This is to go some way in thanking you for that\".\nIn August 2021, it was announced that &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%27s%20Foundation\"&gt;The Prince's Foundation&lt;/a&gt; was launching an investigation into the reports that middlemen took cuts for setting up dinners involving wealthy donors and Prince Charles, with prices as high as \u00a3100,000 and the fixers taking up to 25% of the fees. In the following month it was alleged that the prince's aide &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Fawcett\"&gt;Michael Fawcett&lt;/a&gt; had fixed a &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire\"&gt;CBE&lt;/a&gt; for Saudi businessman &lt;a href=\"Mahfouz%20Marei%20Mubarak%20bin%20Mahfouz\"&gt;Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz&lt;/a&gt; who donated more than \u00a31.5 million to royal charities contrary to section 1 of the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. Charles gave Mahfouz his Honorary CBE at a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace in November 2016, though the event was not published in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20Circular\"&gt;Court Circular&lt;/a&gt;. The allegations led to Fawcett temporarily stepping down from his role as chief executive of The Prince's Foundation, while &lt;a href=\"Republic%20%28political%20organisation%29\"&gt;Republic&lt;/a&gt; reported the prince and Fawcett to the police. The foundation's chairman &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Connell\"&gt;Douglas Connell&lt;/a&gt; also quit his job over claims the charity had accepted \"a six-figure sum from a Russian donor\", with the prince thanking the businessman in a letter and suggesting a meeting. This led to an investigation by the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Charity%20Regulator\"&gt;Scottish Charity Regulator&lt;/a&gt;. Clarence House responded that Charles had \"no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities and fully supports the investigation\". The auditing firm EY, which was hired by the charity to carry out an investigation, published a summary report in December 2021, stating that there was \"no evidence that trustees at the time were aware of these communications\".\nReaction to press treatment.\nCharles's anguish was recorded in his private comments to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;Prince William&lt;/a&gt;, caught on a microphone during a press photo-call in 2005 and published in the national press. After a question from the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;'s royal correspondent, &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Witchell\"&gt;Nicholas Witchell&lt;/a&gt;, Charles muttered: \"These bloody people. I can't bear that man. I mean, he's so awful, he really is.\"\nIn 2002, Charles, \"so often a target of the press, got his chance to return fire\" when addressing \"scores of editors, publishers and other media executives\" gathered at &lt;a href=\"St%20Bride%27s%20Church\"&gt;St Bride's Fleet Street&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate 300 years of journalism. Defending public servants from \"the corrosive drip of constant criticism\", he noted that the press had been \"awkward, cantankerous, cynical, bloody-minded, at times intrusive, at times inaccurate and at times deeply unfair and harmful to individuals and to institutions.\" But, he concluded, regarding his own relations with the press, \"from time to time we are probably both a bit hard on each other, exaggerating the downsides and ignoring the good points in each.\"\nGuest appearances on television.\nThe Prince of Wales has occasionally appeared on television. In 1984, he read his children's book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Man%20of%20Lochnagar\"&gt;The Old Man of Lochnagar&lt;/a&gt;\" for the BBC's \"&lt;a href=\"Jackanory\"&gt;Jackanory&lt;/a&gt;\" series. The UK soap opera \"&lt;a href=\"Coronation%20Street\"&gt;Coronation Street&lt;/a&gt;\" featured an appearance by Charles during the show's 40th anniversary in 2000, as did the New Zealand young adult cartoon series \"&lt;a href=\"bro%27Town\"&gt;bro'Town&lt;/a&gt;\" (2005), after he attended a performance by the show's creators during a tour of the country.\nCharles was interviewed with Princes William and Harry by &lt;a href=\"Ant%20%26amp%3B%20Dec\"&gt;Ant &amp; Dec&lt;/a&gt; to mark the 30th anniversary of The Prince's Trust in 2006 and in 2016 was interviewed by them again along with his sons and the Duchess of Cornwall to mark the 40th anniversary.\nHis saving of the Scottish stately home &lt;a href=\"Dumfries%20House\"&gt;Dumfries House&lt;/a&gt; was the subject of &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Titchmarsh\"&gt;Alan Titchmarsh&lt;/a&gt;'s documentary \"Royal Restoration\", which aired on TV in May 2012. Also in May 2012, Charles tried his hand at being a weather presenter for the BBC, reporting the forecast for Scotland as part of their annual week at &lt;a href=\"Holyrood%20Palace\"&gt;Holyrood Palace&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Blanchett\"&gt;Christopher Blanchett&lt;/a&gt;. He injected humour in his report, asking, \"Who the hell wrote this script?\" as references were made to royal residences.\nIn December 2015, \"&lt;a href=\"Channel%204%20News\"&gt;Channel 4 News&lt;/a&gt;\" revealed that interviews with Charles were subject to a contract that restricts questions to those previously approved, and gives his staff oversight of editing and the right to \"remove the contribution in its entirety from the programme\". \"Channel 4 News\" decided not to proceed with an interview on this basis, which some journalists believed would put them at risk of breaching the &lt;a href=\"Ofcom\"&gt;Ofcom&lt;/a&gt; Broadcasting Code on editorial independence and transparency.\nResidences and finance.\n&lt;a href=\"Clarence%20House\"&gt;Clarence House&lt;/a&gt;, previously the residence of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother&lt;/a&gt;, is Charles's official London residence. His primary source of income is generated from the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Cornwall\"&gt;Duchy of Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;, which owns 133,658 acres of land (around 54,090 hectares), including farming, residential, and commercial properties, as well as an investment portfolio. &lt;a href=\"Highgrove%20House\"&gt;Highgrove House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire\"&gt;Gloucestershire&lt;/a&gt; is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, having been purchased for his use in 1980, and which Prince Charles rents for \u00a3336,000 per annum. The &lt;a href=\"Public%20Accounts%20Committee%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Public Accounts Committee&lt;/a&gt; published its 25th report into the Duchy of Cornwall accounts in November 2013 noting that the duchy performed well in 2012\u201313, increasing its total income and producing an overall surplus of \u00a319.1\u00a0million.\nIn 2007, the prince purchased a 192-acre property (150 acres of grazing and parkland, and 40 acres of woodland) in &lt;a href=\"Carmarthenshire\"&gt;Carmarthenshire&lt;/a&gt;, and applied for permission to convert the farm into a Welsh home for him and the Duchess of Cornwall, to be rented out as holiday flats when the couple is not in residence. A neighbouring family said the proposals flouted local planning regulations, and the application was put on hold temporarily while a report was drafted on how the alterations would affect the local bat population. Charles and Camilla first stayed at the new property, called &lt;a href=\"Llwynywermod\"&gt;Llwynywermod&lt;/a&gt;, in June 2008. They also stay at &lt;a href=\"Birkhall\"&gt;Birkhall&lt;/a&gt; for some holidays, which is a private residence on the &lt;a href=\"Balmoral%20Castle\"&gt;Balmoral Castle&lt;/a&gt; estate in Scotland, and was previously used by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\nIn 2016, it was reported that his estates receive \u00a3100,000 a year in European Union agricultural subsidies. Starting in 1993, the Prince of Wales has paid tax voluntarily under the Memorandum of Understanding on Royal Taxation, updated 2013. In December 2012, &lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%27s%20Revenue%20and%20Customs\"&gt;Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs&lt;/a&gt; were asked to investigate alleged tax avoidance by the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy of Cornwall is named in the &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Papers\"&gt;Paradise Papers&lt;/a&gt;, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to &lt;a href=\"offshore%20investment\"&gt;offshore investment&lt;/a&gt; that were leaked to the German newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"S%C3%BCddeutsche%20Zeitung\"&gt;S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;\". The papers show that the Duchy invested in a Bermuda-based carbon credits trading company run by one of Charles's Cambridge contemporaries. The investment was kept secret but there is no suggestion that Charles or the estate avoided UK tax.\nTitles, styles, honours and arms.\nTitles and styles.\nCharles has held titles throughout his life: the grandson of the monarch, the son of the monarch and in his own right. He has been a &lt;a href=\"British%20prince\"&gt;British prince&lt;/a&gt; since birth and was created Prince of Wales in 1958.\nThere has been speculation as to what &lt;a href=\"regnal%20name\"&gt;regnal name&lt;/a&gt; the prince would choose upon his succession to the throne. If he uses his first name, he would be known as \"Charles III\". However, it was reported in 2005 that Charles has suggested he may choose to reign as \"George VII\" in honour of his &lt;a href=\"George%20VI\"&gt;maternal grandfather&lt;/a&gt;, and to avoid association with the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Stuart\"&gt;Stuart&lt;/a&gt; kings &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles I&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Execution%20of%20Charles%20I\"&gt;who was beheaded&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles\u00a0II&lt;/a&gt; (who was known for his promiscuous lifestyle), as well as to be sensitive to the memory of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Edward%20Stuart\"&gt;Bonnie Prince Charlie&lt;/a&gt;, once a Stuart pretender to the English and Scottish thrones, who was called \"Charles III\" by &lt;a href=\"Jacobitism\"&gt;his supporters&lt;/a&gt;. Charles's office responded that \"no decision has been made\".\nHonours and military appointments.\nCharles has held substantive ranks in the armed forces of a number of countries since he was made a &lt;a href=\"flight%20lieutenant\"&gt;flight lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; in 1972. Charles's first honorary appointment in the armed forces was as &lt;a href=\"Colonel-in-Chief\"&gt;Colonel-in-Chief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Regiment%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Royal Regiment of Wales&lt;/a&gt; in 1969; since then, the prince has also been installed as Colonel-in-Chief, Colonel, Honorary Air Commodore, &lt;a href=\"Air%20Commodore-in-Chief\"&gt;Air Commodore-in-Chief&lt;/a&gt;, Deputy Colonel-in-Chief, Royal Honorary Colonel, Royal Colonel, and Honorary Commodore of at least 32 military formations throughout the Commonwealth, including the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Gurkha%20Rifles\"&gt;Royal Gurkha Rifles&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only foreign regiment in the British army. Since 2009, Charles holds the second-highest ranks in all three branches of the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Forces\"&gt;Canadian Forces&lt;/a&gt; and, on 16 June 2012, the Queen awarded the Prince of Wales honorary five-star rank in all three branches of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;British Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;, \"to acknowledge his support in her role as Commander-in-Chief\", installing him as &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20of%20the%20Fleet%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;Admiral of the Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Field%20marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Field Marshal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20of%20the%20Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Marshal of the Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe has been inducted into seven orders and received eight decorations from the Commonwealth realms, and has been the recipient of 20 different honours from foreign states, as well as nine honorary degrees from universities in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.\nBanners, flags, and standards.\nThe banners used by the prince vary depending upon location. His Personal Standard is the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Standard%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Royal Standard of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; differenced as in his arms with a label of three points Argent, and the escutcheon of the arms of the Principality of Wales in the centre. It is used outside Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, and Canada, and throughout the entire United Kingdom when the prince is acting in an official capacity associated with the UK Armed Forces.\nThe personal flag for use in Wales is based upon the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Badge%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Royal Badge of Wales&lt;/a&gt; (the historic arms of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Gwynedd\"&gt;Kingdom of Gwynedd&lt;/a&gt;), which consist of four quadrants, the first and fourth with a red lion on a gold field, and the second and third with a gold lion on a red field. Superimposed is an escutcheon &lt;a href=\"Vert%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;Vert&lt;/a&gt; bearing the single-arched coronet of the Prince of Wales.\nIn Scotland the personal banner used since 1974 is based upon three ancient Scottish titles: &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Rothesay\"&gt;Duke of Rothesay&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"heir%20apparent\"&gt;heir apparent&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Scots\"&gt;King of Scots&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"High%20Steward%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;High Steward of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20the%20Isles\"&gt;Lord of the Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The flag is divided into four quadrants like the arms of the Chief of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Stewart%20of%20Appin\"&gt;Clan Stewart of Appin&lt;/a&gt;; the first and fourth quadrants comprise a gold field with a blue and silver checkered band in the centre; the second and third quadrants display a black galley on a silver field. The arms are differenced from those of Appin by the addition of an inescutcheon bearing the tressured lion rampant of Scotland; defaced by a plain label of three points Azure to indicate the heir apparent.\nIn Cornwall, the banner is the arms of the Duke of Cornwall: \"&lt;a href=\"Sable%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;Sable&lt;/a&gt; 15 &lt;a href=\"bezant\"&gt;bezant&lt;/a&gt;s Or\", that is, a black field bearing 15 gold coins.\nIn 2011, the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Heraldic%20Authority\"&gt;Canadian Heraldic Authority&lt;/a&gt; introduced a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20standards%20of%20Canada%23Other%20members%20of%20the%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;personal heraldic banner&lt;/a&gt; for the Prince of Wales for use in Canada, consisting of the shield of the &lt;a href=\"Arms%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Arms of Canada&lt;/a&gt; defaced with both a blue &lt;a href=\"roundel%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;roundel&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Wales%27s%20feathers\"&gt;Prince of Wales's feathers&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by a wreath of gold maple leaves, and a white label of three points.\nReferences.\nOther sources"
