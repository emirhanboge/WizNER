    "text": "The Upper Tweeddale National Scenic Area lies in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Borders\"&gt;Borders region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of 40 &lt;a href=\"national%20scenic%20area%20%28Scotland%29\"&gt;national scenic areas&lt;/a&gt; (NSA) in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure their protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers 12,770\u00a0&lt;a href=\"hectares\"&gt;ha&lt;/a&gt; (49 square miles) of countryside surrounding the upper reaches of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Tweed\"&gt;River Tweed&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Broughton%2C%20Scottish%20Borders\"&gt;Broughton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peebles\"&gt;Peebles&lt;/a&gt;.\nNational scenic areas are designated primarily to recognise the scenic qualities of an area, but sometimes also e.g. its culture, history, archaeology, geology or wildlife. Areas with such qualities may be protected via other national and international designations that overlap with the NSA designation. There are two &lt;a href=\"Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest\"&gt;Sites of Special Scientific Interest&lt;/a&gt; (SSSI) within the designated area of the Upper Tweeddale NSA.\nAlthough the national scenic area designation provides a degree of additional protection via the planning process, there are no bodies equivalent to a &lt;a href=\"national%20park%20authority\"&gt;national park authority&lt;/a&gt;, and whilst &lt;a href=\"Subdivisions%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;local authorities&lt;/a&gt; (in this case &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Borders%20Council\"&gt;Scottish Borders Council&lt;/a&gt;) can produce a management strategy for each one, only the three national scenic areas within &lt;a href=\"Dumfries%20and%20Galloway\"&gt;Dumfries and Galloway&lt;/a&gt; currently have management strategies.\nCreation of the national scenic area.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, a committee, chaired by Sir Douglas Ramsay, was established to consider preservation of the landscape in Scotland. The report, published in 1945, proposed that five areas (&lt;a href=\"Loch%20Lomond%20and%20The%20Trossachs%20National%20Park\"&gt;Loch Lomond and the Trossachs&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cairngorms\"&gt;Cairngorms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Nevis%20and%20Glen%20Coe%20National%20Scenic%20Area\"&gt;Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wester%20Ross\"&gt;Wester Ross&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Strathfarrar\"&gt;Glen Strathfarrar&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Glen%20Affric\"&gt;Glen Affric&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Glen%20Cannich\"&gt;Glen Cannich&lt;/a&gt;) should receive a level of protection. Accordingly, the government designated these areas as \"national park direction areas\", giving powers for planning decisions taken by local authorities to be reviewed by central government. Following a further review of landscape protection in 1978, additional areas, including the area of the current Upper Tweeddale NSA, were identified as worthy of protection due to their landscape qualities. Accordingly, in 1981 the direction areas were replaced by the national scenic area designation, which was based on the 1978 recommendations and thus included this area. The defined area remains as originally mapped in 1978, but was redesignated under new legislation in 2010.\nDescription.\nThe original 1978 report that led to the area being designated as a national scenic area noted:\nHistoric features of the area include the &lt;a href=\"hill%20fort\"&gt;hill fort&lt;/a&gt; at Dreva Craig, Barns Tower, and the &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Stobo%20Castle\"&gt;Stobo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neidpath%20Castle\"&gt;Neidpath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drumelzier%23Tinnis\"&gt;Tinnis&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"John%20Buchan%20Way\"&gt;John Buchan Way&lt;/a&gt;, a 22\u00a0km walking route between Broughton and Peebles, passes through the area.\nConservation designations.\nThe River Tweed (including tributaries such as the &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Water\"&gt;Manor Water&lt;/a&gt; and the Holm Water) is designated as a &lt;a href=\"Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation\"&gt;Special Area of Conservation&lt;/a&gt;, holding important populations of &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"brook%20lamprey\"&gt;brook lamprey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"European%20river%20lamprey\"&gt;river lamprey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sea%20lamprey\"&gt;sea lamprey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20otter\"&gt;otter&lt;/a&gt;. The river has a very diverse ecology due to the mixed geology of its catchment area, and is also designated as a &lt;a href=\"Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest\"&gt;Site of Special Scientific Interest&lt;/a&gt; (SSSI). There is a further SSSI within the boundaries of the NSA, the &lt;a href=\"Tweedsmuir%20Hills\"&gt;Tweedsmuir Hills&lt;/a&gt;, which form the largest area of mountain plateau in Scotland outwith (i.e. outside) the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Highlands\"&gt;Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, and which hosts nationally important populations of breeding birds, &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"liverwort\"&gt;liverwort&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arctic%E2%80%93alpine\"&gt;arctic\u2013alpine&lt;/a&gt; plants. The grounds surrounding Barns Tower and &lt;a href=\"Stobo%20Castle\"&gt;Stobo Castle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dawyck%20Botanic%20Garden\"&gt;Dawyck Botanic Garden&lt;/a&gt;, are listed in the &lt;a href=\"Inventory%20of%20Gardens%20and%20Designed%20Landscapes%20in%20Scotland\"&gt;Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;."
