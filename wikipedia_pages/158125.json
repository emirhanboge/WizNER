    "text": "KNOPPIX ( ) is an &lt;a href=\"operating%20system\"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href=\"Debian\"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; designed to be run directly from a &lt;a href=\"Compact%20Disc\"&gt;CD&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Live%20CD\"&gt;Live CD&lt;/a&gt;) or a &lt;a href=\"USB%20flash%20drive\"&gt;USB flash drive&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Live%20USB\"&gt;Live USB&lt;/a&gt;), one of the first of its kind for any operating system. Knoppix was developed by, and named after, Linux consultant &lt;a href=\"Klaus%20Knopper\"&gt;Klaus Knopper&lt;/a&gt;. When starting a program, it is loaded from the removable medium and decompressed into a &lt;a href=\"RAM%20drive\"&gt;RAM drive&lt;/a&gt;. The decompression is &lt;a href=\"transparency%20%28human-computer%20interaction%29\"&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"On%20the%20fly%23Computer%20usage\"&gt;on-the-fly&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough KNOPPIX is primarily designed to be used as a Live CD, it can also be installed on a &lt;a href=\"hard%20disk\"&gt;hard disk&lt;/a&gt; like a typical operating system. Computers that support booting from USB devices can load KNOPPIX from a live USB &lt;a href=\"USB%20flash%20drive\"&gt;flash drive&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"memory%20card\"&gt;memory card&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two main editions: the traditional compact-disc (700 &lt;a href=\"megabyte\"&gt;megabyte&lt;/a&gt;s) edition and the DVD (4.7 &lt;a href=\"gigabyte\"&gt;gigabyte&lt;/a&gt;s) \"Maxi\" edition. The CD edition had not been updated since June 2013 until recently. As of version 9.1, CD images are being released once again. Each main edition has two language-specific editions: English and German.\nKNOPPIX mostly consists of &lt;a href=\"free%20and%20open%20source%20software\"&gt;free and open source software&lt;/a&gt;, but also includes some &lt;a href=\"proprietary%20software\"&gt;proprietary software&lt;/a&gt;, as long as it fulfills certain conditions.\nKnoppix can be used to copy files easily from hard drives with inaccessible operating systems. To quickly and more safely use Linux software, the Live CD can be used instead of installing another OS.\nContents.\nMore than 1000 software packages are included on the CD edition, and more than 2600 packages are included on the DVD edition. Up to nine gigabytes can be stored on the DVD in &lt;a href=\"data%20compression\"&gt;compressed&lt;/a&gt; form. These packages include:\nHardware requirements.\nMinimum hardware requirements for Knoppix:\nSaving changes in the environment.\nPrior to Knoppix 3.8.2, any documents or settings a user created would disappear upon reboot. This lack of persistence then made it necessary to save documents directly to a hard drive partition, over the network, or to some &lt;a href=\"removable%20media\"&gt;removable media&lt;/a&gt;, such as a USB flash drive.\nIt was also possible to set up a \"persistent home directory\", where any documents or settings written to the user's home directory would automatically be redirected to a hard drive or removable media, which could be automatically &lt;a href=\"Mount%20point\"&gt;mounted&lt;/a&gt; on bootup. A single file, \"knoppix.img\", was cached on the rewritable media and used to simulate a file system into which files were written for later use. This allowed the user to transparently write to their home directory.\n&lt;a href=\"Union%20mount\"&gt;Union mount&lt;/a&gt; support was added in version 3.8.1 through &lt;a href=\"UnionFS\"&gt;UnionFS&lt;/a&gt;. This was later replaced by &lt;a href=\"Aufs\"&gt;Aufs&lt;/a&gt; in 5.1.0 to improve stability. The union mount allowed virtual updates to the data on the read-only CD/DVD media by storing changes on separate writable media and then representing the combination of the two as single &lt;a href=\"Computer%20data%20storage\"&gt;storage device&lt;/a&gt;. The writable media could be memory (&lt;a href=\"ramdisk\"&gt;ramdisk&lt;/a&gt;), a hard disk, USB flash drive, etc. This means that the user could modify the software installed on the Knoppix system, such as by using &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Packaging%20Tool\"&gt;APT&lt;/a&gt; to install or update software. The storage device containing the changes needed to be present whenever Knoppix is started, else only the original data from the disc would be used. While Knoppix would scan available storage devices for a persistent home directory by default, a user could dictate a specific location with a boot option (&lt;a href=\"%23Boot%20options\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;) such as:\ncodice_1\nBy carrying a Knoppix CD and a USB flash drive, a user could have the same environment, programs, settings, and data available on any computer that could run Knoppix.\nThis functionality was only available through Knoppix 5.1.1 (CD release) or 5.3.1 (DVD release). Subsequently, the Live CD paradigm has transformed into portable operating systems that run on external storage.\nBoot options.\nWhen using Knoppix as a Live CD, one can use boot options, also known as 'cheatcodes', to override a default setting or automatic hardware detection when it fails. For example, the user may wish to boot into a plain console, or proceed without SCSI support. For this, Knoppix allows the user to enter one or more cheat codes at the prompt before booting. If the user does not enter a cheat code, or does not press any key before the timeout, Knoppix will boot with its default options. For example, to set the language to French rather than the default, one would type:\ncodice_2\nKnoppix is a &lt;a href=\"32-bit\"&gt;32-bit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Debian\"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; Linux based distro, but recent releases (including the latest version 7.6) have also been equipped with a &lt;a href=\"64-bit%20computing\"&gt;64-bit&lt;/a&gt; kernel on the DVD edition, where it will automatically boot up for 64-bit computers, or by using the boot option codice_3 manually in the command-line prompt, while codice_4 will boot up the 32-bit kernel. Neither PAE nor 64-bit applications are supported by Knoppix, and system memory with more than 4\u00a0GB can only be used with a 64-bit kernel.\nThe DVD edition of Knoppix can also be loaded onto a USB flash drive, with \"flash-knoppix\" under the Knoppix system, such that \"the KNOPPIX Live System starts and runs about factor 5 faster from USB flash disk than from CD or DVD!\". Besides that, the experimental UEFI support is provided for USB flash drive rather than DVD media. 32-bit UEFI firmware can only boot up the 32-bit kernel, while 64-bit UEFI firmware can only boot up the 64-bit kernel. The text interface for UEFI is similar with it for BIOS, one can also press key F2 and F3 to access information on boot options.\nPopularity.\nKnoppix was one of the first Live CD Linux distributions to gain popularity. There are several factors that contribute to the popularity of Knoppix:\nKnoppix works on a fairly large number of PCs or laptops, but not all. The automatic hardware detection cannot cope with all hardware, and sometimes the drivers used will not be optimal. Knoppix has difficulty recognizing some cards made before 1998, or motherboards with a BIOS made before 2002. (In some cases, manual configuration with codes entered at boot time can overcome problems with automatic detection.)\nIf a PC does not have enough RAM to run KDE and other included programs, the legacy Knoppix (earlier than 6.0) boots up a very limited &lt;a href=\"twm\"&gt;twm&lt;/a&gt; session instead. The only window running in the twm session by default is xterm.\nVersions.\nThe table (to the right) shows the version history of major releases.\nKnoppix 4.x\u20135.x.\nAs of April 2008, from version 4 up until 5.1.1, Knoppix has been split into a DVD \"maxi\" edition (with over 9 GB of software), and a CD \"light\" edition; both were developed in parallel.\nUp until Knoppix 5.1.1, the CD editions contained a selection of graphical environments, including the TWM window manager, and &lt;a href=\"KDE%203\"&gt;KDE 3&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a feature-complete desktop environment default in Knoppix 5.3.1 and earlier.\nNo further development is being done on the traditional 5.x versions.\nKnoppix 6.x.\nKNOPPIX 6.0.1 / ADRIANE 1.1 is a CD-edition again, and a complete rebuild from scratch. LXDE was made the default desktop environment, and the edition contains a substantially reduced software collection in order to easily fit on a CD.\nThe KNOPPIX 6.2.1 release has both CD and DVD editions, and ADRIANE 1.2 only has a CD-edition.\nKnoppix 6.7.1 has the last CD version with stable touchpad drivers.\nKnoppix 7.x.\nFrom June 2013 on until March 2019, Knoppix 7.2 was the most recent release with a CD edition. By 2018, its software had become very outdated, as the &lt;a href=\"GNU%20C%20Library%23Version%20history\"&gt;libc6 2.17&lt;/a&gt; library no longer suffices for installation of several modern packages. The 7.x version range is known for instabilities with touchpads.\nVersion 7.2 still remains the most recent CD version of Knoppix in wide distribution.\nKnoppix 8.x.\nThe KNOPPIX 8.0.0 edition was released at CeBIT 2017.\nKNOPPIX 8.1.0 was released in September 2017 as the first public release in the 8.x series.\nThe version 8.0.0 has the &lt;a href=\"dual%20boot\"&gt;dual boot&lt;/a&gt;, and a choice between three different desktops:&lt;a href=\"LXDE\"&gt;LXDE&lt;/a&gt; as default option, &lt;a href=\"KDE\"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"GNOME\"&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt;.\nVersions 8.2.0 and newer (8.2.x, not 8.5.x) are available on Knoppix mirrors.\nKnoppix 8.5 was a DVD version that was not available for download, but was published as an exclusive version only bundled with a physical edition of Linux-Magazin or LinuxUser. Version 8.5 no longer includes &lt;a href=\"Systemd\"&gt;Systemd&lt;/a&gt;, which was replaced by elogind. Spectre and Meltdown kernel vulnerabilities have been mitigated.\nKnoppix 8.6 (and newer) is a DVD version available for download on Knoppix mirrors.\nDerivatives.\nAdriane Knoppix.\nAdriane Knoppix is a variation that is intended for &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"visual%20impairment\"&gt;visually impaired&lt;/a&gt; people, which can be used entirely without vision oriented output devices. It was released in the third quarter of 2007 as a Live CD. \"Adriane Knoppix\" is named after Adriane Knopper, the wife of Klaus Knopper, the developer of Knoppix. Adriane has a visual impairment, and has been assisting Klaus with the development of the software. The name Adriane is also a &lt;a href=\"backronym\"&gt;backronym&lt;/a&gt; for \"Audio Desktop Reference Implementation And Networking Environment\".\nAdriane Knoppix is intended not only for the blind but also for beginners who don\u2019t know much about computers. It uses the &lt;a href=\"SUSE%20Linux\"&gt;SUSE&lt;/a&gt; Blinux &lt;a href=\"screen%20reader\"&gt;screen reader&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"phoneme\"&gt;phoneme&lt;/a&gt; generator and speech engine for normal output."
