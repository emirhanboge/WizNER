    "text": "Salter is a British housewares brand developing products that span a wide range of core product categories, including scales, electricals, cookware and countertop. It is a market leader in kitchen and bathroom scales and one of the UK\u2019s oldest consumer brands. Established in 1760, Salter has been developing precision products for over 260 years. It was acquired by Manchester-based consumer goods giant Ultimate Products in 2021, after they had previously licensed the brand for cookware and kitchen electrical since 2011. \nHistory.\nThe firm began life in the late 1760s in the village of &lt;a href=\"Bilston\"&gt;Bilston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; when Richard Salter, a &lt;a href=\"spring%20%28device%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; maker, began making the first &lt;a href=\"spring%20scale\"&gt;spring scale&lt;/a&gt;s in Britain. He called these scales \"pocket &lt;a href=\"Steelyard%20balance\"&gt;steelyards&lt;/a&gt;\", though they work on a different principle from steelyard balances.\nBy 1825 his nephew George had taken over the company, which became known as George Salter &amp; Co. George later established a manufacturing site in the town of &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich\"&gt;West Bromwich&lt;/a&gt;, about 4 miles (7\u00a0km) from Bilston. &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt; football club was formed from workers at this works site. From here the company produced a wide variety of scales including the UK's first bathroom scales. Other items were added to the range, including irons, mincers, potato chippers, coin-operated machines and the first typewriters made in the UK.\nThe business thrived throughout the 1900s, and by 1950 it employed over 2000 people, still in the same area and owned by the same family.\nLate 20th century to present.\nIn 1972 the company was purchased by Staveley Industries Plc and was split into separate subsidiaries: housewares, industrial, etc., relocating as required.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s Staveley acquired more businesses worldwide to form a new \"weighing group\", including the Weigh-Tronix company of America, and in 1998 after a &lt;a href=\"management%20buyout\"&gt;management buyout&lt;/a&gt; (MBO), this became the Weigh-Tronix Corporation, with Salter Housewares a part of that. The focus of the new corporation was increasingly towards industrial or commercial weighing, and in February 2002 the management team at Salter Housewares Ltd. bought the company out from the group to concentrate on its consumer businesses. The MBO was backed by Barclays Private Equity to the sum of \u00a318 million (\u20ac28m).\nThe company grew rapidly for the next two years, and in March 2004 it was sold to HoMedics, a US-based manufacturer of \"personal wellness\" products, generating an &lt;a href=\"internal%20rate%20of%20return\"&gt;internal rate of return&lt;/a&gt; (IRR) of approximately 70% for Barclays Private Equity. In 2006, Salter Housewares USA and Taylor Precision Products Inc. (also owned by HoMedics) merged their sales, marketing and distribution operations.\nThe company has since closed its historic factory in West Bromwich, England and shifted manufacture to China. The site has been sold for redevelopment.\nSalter began a partnership with chef Heston Blumenthal in 2010. Salter\u2019s design team work alongside Heston\u2019s team from the Fat Duck kitchens to develop a range of precision weighing instruments. \nIn 2011, Greater Manchester based consumer goods giant Ultimate Products Global Sourcing licensed the Salter Brand to sell electrical cookware, bakeware, food prep and small domestic appliances. \nUltimate Products announced the \u00a334m acquisition of the Salter brand in July 2021.
