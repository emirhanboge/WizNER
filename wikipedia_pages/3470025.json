    "text": "The First Biesheuvel &lt;a href=\"cabinet%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Executive%20%28government%29\"&gt;executive branch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Politics%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch Government&lt;/a&gt; from 6 July 1971 until 9 August 1972. The cabinet was formed by the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20democracy\"&gt;christian-democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;Catholic People's Party&lt;/a&gt; (KVP), &lt;a href=\"Anti-Revolutionary%20Party\"&gt;Anti-Revolutionary Party&lt;/a&gt; (ARP) and &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Historical%20Union\"&gt;Christian Historical Union&lt;/a&gt; (CHU), the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20liberalism\"&gt;conservative-liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20for%20Freedom%20and%20Democracy\"&gt;People's Party for Freedom and Democracy&lt;/a&gt; (VVD) and the &lt;a href=\"Social%20democracy\"&gt;social-democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Socialists%20%2770\"&gt;Democratic Socialists '70&lt;/a&gt; (DS'70) after the &lt;a href=\"1971%20Dutch%20general%20election\"&gt;election of 1971&lt;/a&gt;. The cabinet was a &lt;a href=\"Centrism\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt; coalition and had a slim &lt;a href=\"majority%20government\"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Representatives%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Anti-Revolutionary%20Party%23Leadership\"&gt;Protestant Leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barend%20Biesheuvel\"&gt;Barend Biesheuvel&lt;/a&gt; a former Minister of Agriculture serving as &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;. Prominent &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; politician &lt;a href=\"Roelof%20Nelissen\"&gt;Roelof Nelissen&lt;/a&gt; the Minister of Economic Affairs in the previous &lt;a href=\"De%20Jong%20cabinet\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; served as &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Deputy Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Ministers%20of%20Finance%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Minister of Finance&lt;/a&gt; and was given the portfolio of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Suriname and Netherlands Antilles Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Party%20for%20Freedom%20and%20Democracy\"&gt;Liberal Leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Geertsema\"&gt;Molly Geertsema&lt;/a&gt; served as Deputy Prime Minister and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Ministers%20of%20the%20Interior%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Minister of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cabinet served in the early years of the &lt;a href=\"Radical%20politics\"&gt;radical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1970s\"&gt;1970s&lt;/a&gt;. Domestically it had to deal with the peak of the &lt;a href=\"Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s\"&gt;counterculture&lt;/a&gt; and a growing &lt;a href=\"inflation\"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt; but it was able to implement several &lt;a href=\"Reform%20movement\"&gt;social reforms&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"public%20sector\"&gt;public sector&lt;/a&gt; and stimulating &lt;a href=\"deregulation\"&gt;deregulation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"privatization\"&gt;privatization&lt;/a&gt;. The cabinet suffered several major internal conflicts between the cabinet members of the Democratic Socialists '70 and the rest of the coalition which lead to the fall of the cabinet just 1 year into its term on 19 July 1972 with the Democratic Socialists '70 cabinet members resigning on 21 July 1972 and the cabinet continued in a &lt;a href=\"Demissionary%20cabinet\"&gt;demissionary&lt;/a&gt; capacity until it was replaced with the &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%20government\"&gt;caretaker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Second%20Biesheuvel%20cabinet\"&gt;Second Biesheuvel cabinet&lt;/a&gt; on 9 August 1972.\nTerm.\nProblems of the cabinet were the release of war criminals (three of Breda) and the increasing inflation, combined with a stagnating economy (&lt;a href=\"stagflation\"&gt;stagflation&lt;/a&gt;). The decision to cut government expenses was not supported by DS'70, so the cabinet lost its majority in the parliament, resulting in Biesheuvel II.\nMinister Stuyt, the first minister for &lt;a href=\"natural%20environment\"&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt; affairs, issued an urgency-note concerning the environment. In 1972, the first report from the &lt;a href=\"Club%20of%20Rome\"&gt;Club of Rome&lt;/a&gt; was published, which showed that the environment is in a bad state worldwide and that resources will eventually run out.\nThe cabinet recognised the &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;GDR&lt;/a&gt; and voted to allow &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; back into the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;."
