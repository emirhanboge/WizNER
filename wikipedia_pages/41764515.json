Sims&lt;/a&gt;\" which required the creation of state legislature districts to be made as equal in population as possible and the 1973 creation of the 40-district map, the 12th District consisted of all of &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Hudson County&lt;/a&gt;. Senators were elected &lt;a href=\"at-large\"&gt;at-large&lt;/a&gt; in the 12th District; three members of the Senate were elected in the 1965 and 1971 elections for a two-year term and four Senators were elected for the four-year term elected in the 1967 elections. From 1967 until 1971, the 12th Senate District was split into four Assembly districts with each district electing two members. For the final election held under the interim measures, the 12th Senate District was split into three Assembly districts each electing two members and an additional Assembly member elected at-large by the entire county.\nThe members elected to the Senate from this district are as follows:\nThe members elected to the Assembly from each district are as follows:\nDistrict composition since 1973.\nWhen the 40-district legislative map was created in 1973, the 12th District first included the Middlesex County townships of &lt;a href=\"Monroe%20Township%2C%20Middlesex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Monroe Township&lt;/a&gt; and Madison (now Old Bridge) and the northern Monmouth County municipalities of Matawan borough and township (the latter now &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Keyport%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Keyport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Union%20Beach%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Union Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keansburg%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Keansburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Middletown%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Middletown Township&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Bank%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Red Bank&lt;/a&gt;. For the 1981 redistricting, almost the entire district was changed, only retaining Red Bank from the previous map. It consisted of all of western Monmouth County and some boroughs of northeastern Monmouth including &lt;a href=\"Tinton%20Falls%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Tinton Falls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rumson%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Rumson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"West%20Long%20Branch%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;West Long Branch&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1991 redistricting, the total area of the district was reduced as the four &lt;a href=\"Salient%20%28geography%29\"&gt;panhandle&lt;/a&gt; municipalities of western Monmouth and some of the boroughs on the east side of the district were shifted to other districts. The district became a long, narrow district in an east\u2013west fashion in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Legislative%20Districts%2C%202001%20apportionment\"&gt;2001 redistricting&lt;/a&gt; stretching from &lt;a href=\"Oceanport%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Oceanport&lt;/a&gt; through the central Monmouth townships, and continuing into &lt;a href=\"East%20Windsor%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;East Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hightstown%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Hightstown&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Mercer County&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Legislative%20Districts%2C%202011%20apportionment\"&gt;2011 redistricting&lt;/a&gt;, the district boundaries experienced yet another major change when it became composed of municipalities from four counties, Burlington, Ocean, Monmouth, and Middlesex.\nElection results, 1973\u2013present.\nSenate.\n \n \n \n \nGeneral Assembly.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nElection results, 1965\u20131973.\nSenate.\n \nGeneral Assembly.\nDistrict 12B.\n \n \nDistrict 12C.\n \n "
