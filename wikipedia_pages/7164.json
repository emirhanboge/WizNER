    "text": "The color temperature of a light source is the &lt;a href=\"temperature\"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; of an ideal &lt;a href=\"black-body%20radiation\"&gt;black-body radiator&lt;/a&gt; that radiates light of a color comparable to that of the light source. Color temperature is a characteristic of &lt;a href=\"visible%20light\"&gt;visible light&lt;/a&gt; that has important applications in &lt;a href=\"lighting\"&gt;lighting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"photography\"&gt;photography&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"videography\"&gt;videography&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"publishing\"&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"manufacturing\"&gt;manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"astrophysics\"&gt;astrophysics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horticulture\"&gt;horticulture&lt;/a&gt;, and other fields. In practice, color temperature is meaningful only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., light in a range going from red to orange to yellow to &lt;a href=\"white\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; to blueish white; it does not make sense to speak of the color temperature of, e.g., a green or a purple light. Color temperature is conventionally expressed in &lt;a href=\"kelvin\"&gt;kelvin&lt;/a&gt;s, using the symbol K, a &lt;a href=\"unit%20of%20measure\"&gt;unit of measure&lt;/a&gt; for absolute temperature.\nColor temperatures over 5000\u00a0K are called \"cool colors\" (bluish), while lower color temperatures (2700\u20133000\u00a0K) are called \"warm colors\" (yellowish). \"Warm\" in this context is an analogy to radiated heat flux of traditional &lt;a href=\"incandescent%20light\"&gt;incandescent light&lt;/a&gt;ing rather than temperature. The spectral peak of warm-colored light is closer to infrared, and most natural warm-colored light sources emit significant infrared radiation. The fact that \"warm\" lighting in this sense actually has a \"cooler\" color temperature often leads to confusion.\nCategorizing different lighting.\nThe color temperature of the &lt;a href=\"electromagnetic%20radiation\"&gt;electromagnetic radiation&lt;/a&gt; emitted from an ideal &lt;a href=\"black%20body\"&gt;black body&lt;/a&gt; is defined as its surface temperature in &lt;a href=\"kelvin\"&gt;kelvin&lt;/a&gt;s, or alternatively in &lt;a href=\"mired\"&gt;micro reciprocal degree&lt;/a&gt;s (mired). This permits the definition of a standard by which light sources are compared.\nTo the extent that a hot surface emits &lt;a href=\"thermal%20radiation\"&gt;thermal radiation&lt;/a&gt; but is not an ideal black-body radiator, the color temperature of the light is not the actual temperature of the surface. An &lt;a href=\"incandescent%20lamp\"&gt;incandescent lamp&lt;/a&gt;'s light is thermal radiation, and the bulb approximates an ideal black-body radiator, so its color temperature is essentially the temperature of the filament. Thus a relatively low temperature emits a dull red and a high temperature emits the almost white of the traditional incandescent light bulb. Metal workers are able to judge the temperature of hot metals by their color, from dark red to orange-white and then white (see &lt;a href=\"red%20heat\"&gt;red heat&lt;/a&gt;).\nMany other light sources, such as &lt;a href=\"fluorescent%20lamp\"&gt;fluorescent lamp&lt;/a&gt;s, or light emitting diodes (&lt;a href=\"LED\"&gt;LED&lt;/a&gt;s) emit light primarily by processes other than thermal radiation. This means that the emitted radiation does not follow the form of a &lt;a href=\"Planck%27s%20law\"&gt;black-body spectrum&lt;/a&gt;. These sources are assigned what is known as a &lt;a href=\"Color%20temperature%23Correlated%20color%20temperature\"&gt;correlated color temperature&lt;/a&gt; (CCT). CCT is the color temperature of a black-body radiator which to &lt;a href=\"color%20vision\"&gt;human color perception&lt;/a&gt; most closely matches the light from the lamp. Because such an approximation is not required for incandescent light, the CCT for an incandescent light is simply its unadjusted temperature, derived from comparison to a black-body radiator.\nThe Sun.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; closely approximates a black-body radiator. The effective temperature, defined by the total radiative power per square unit, is about 5780\u00a0K. The color temperature of &lt;a href=\"sunlight\"&gt;sunlight&lt;/a&gt; above the atmosphere is about 5900\u00a0K.\nThe Sun may appear red, orange, yellow, or white from Earth, depending on &lt;a href=\"position%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;its position&lt;/a&gt; in the sky. The changing color of the Sun over the course of the day is mainly a result of the &lt;a href=\"scattering\"&gt;scattering&lt;/a&gt; of sunlight and is not due to changes in black-body radiation. &lt;a href=\"Rayleigh%20scattering\"&gt;Rayleigh scattering&lt;/a&gt; of sunlight by &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20atmosphere\"&gt;Earth's atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; causes the blue color of the sky, which tends to scatter blue light more than red light.\nSome &lt;a href=\"daylight\"&gt;daylight&lt;/a&gt; in the early &lt;a href=\"morning\"&gt;morning&lt;/a&gt; and late &lt;a href=\"afternoon\"&gt;afternoon&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"golden%20hour%20%28photography%29\"&gt;golden hours&lt;/a&gt;) has a lower (\"warmer\") color temperature due to increased &lt;a href=\"light%20scattering%20by%20particles\"&gt;scattering&lt;/a&gt; of shorter-wavelength sunlight by &lt;a href=\"particulates\"&gt;atmospheric particles&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 an &lt;a href=\"optical%20phenomenon\"&gt;optical phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Tyndall%20effect\"&gt;Tyndall effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaylight has a spectrum similar to that of a black body with a correlated color temperature of 6500\u00a0K (&lt;a href=\"CIE%20Standard%20Illuminant%20D65\"&gt;D65&lt;/a&gt; viewing standard) or 5500\u00a0K (daylight-balanced photographic film standard).\nFor colors based on black-body theory, blue occurs at higher temperatures, whereas red occurs at lower temperatures. This is the opposite of the cultural associations attributed to colors, in which \"red\" is \"hot\", and \"blue\" is \"cold\".\nApplications.\nLighting.\nFor lighting building interiors, it is often important to take into account the color temperature of illumination. A warmer (i.e., a lower color temperature) light is often used in public areas to promote relaxation, while a cooler (higher color temperature) light is used to enhance concentration, for example in schools and offices.\nCCT dimming for LED technology is regarded as a difficult task, since binning, age and temperature drift effects of LEDs change the actual color value output. Here feedback loop systems are used, for example with color sensors, to actively monitor and control the color output of multiple color mixing LEDs.\nAquaculture.\nIn &lt;a href=\"fishkeeping\"&gt;fishkeeping&lt;/a&gt;, color temperature has different functions and foci in the various branches.\nDigital photography.\nIn &lt;a href=\"digital%20photography\"&gt;digital photography&lt;/a&gt;, the term color temperature sometimes refers to remapping of color values to simulate variations in ambient color temperature. Most digital cameras and raw image software provide presets simulating specific ambient values (e.g., sunny, cloudy, tungsten, etc.) while others allow explicit entry of white balance values in kelvins. These settings vary color values along the blue\u2013yellow axis, while some software includes additional controls (sometimes labeled \"tint\") adding the magenta\u2013green axis, and are to some extent arbitrary and a matter of artistic interpretation.\nPhotographic film.\nPhotographic emulsion film does not respond to lighting color identically to the human retina or visual perception. An object that appears to the observer to be white may turn out to be very blue or orange in a photograph. The &lt;a href=\"color%20balance\"&gt;color balance&lt;/a&gt; may need to be corrected during printing to achieve a neutral color print. The extent of this correction is limited since color film normally has three layers sensitive to different colors and when used under the \"wrong\" light source, every layer may not respond proportionally, giving odd color casts in the shadows, although the mid-tones may have been correctly white-balanced under the enlarger. Light sources with discontinuous spectra, such as fluorescent tubes, cannot be fully corrected in printing either, since one of the layers may barely have recorded an image at all.\nPhotographic film is made for specific light sources (most commonly daylight film and &lt;a href=\"tungsten%20film\"&gt;tungsten film&lt;/a&gt;), and, used properly, will create a neutral color print. Matching the &lt;a href=\"sensitometry\"&gt;sensitivity of the film&lt;/a&gt; to the color temperature of the light source is one way to balance color. If tungsten film is used indoors with incandescent lamps, the yellowish-orange light of the &lt;a href=\"tungsten\"&gt;tungsten&lt;/a&gt; incandescent lamps will appear as white (3200\u00a0K) in the photograph. Color negative film is almost always daylight-balanced, since it is assumed that color can be adjusted in printing (with limitations, see above). Color transparency film, being the final artefact in the process, has to be matched to the light source or filters must be used to correct color.\n&lt;a href=\"filter%20%28photography%29\"&gt;Filters&lt;/a&gt; on a camera lens, or &lt;a href=\"color%20gel\"&gt;color gel&lt;/a&gt;s over the light source(s) may be used to correct color balance. When shooting with a bluish light (high color temperature) source such as on an overcast day, in the shade, in window light, or if using tungsten film with white or blue light, a yellowish-orange filter will correct this. For shooting with daylight film (calibrated to 5600\u00a0K) under warmer (low color temperature) light sources such as sunsets, candlelight or &lt;a href=\"tungsten%20lighting\"&gt;tungsten lighting&lt;/a&gt;, a bluish (e.g. #80A) filter may be used. More-subtle filters are needed to correct for the difference between, say 3200\u00a0K and 3400\u00a0K tungsten lamps or to correct for the slightly blue cast of some flash tubes, which may be 6000\u00a0K.\nIf there is more than one light source with varied color temperatures, one way to balance the color is to use daylight film and place color-correcting gel filters over each light source.\nPhotographers sometimes use color temperature meters. These are usually designed to read only two regions along the visible spectrum (red and blue); more expensive ones read three regions (red, green, and blue). However, they are ineffective with sources such as fluorescent or discharge lamps, whose light varies in color and may be harder to correct for. Because this light is often greenish, a magenta filter may correct it. More sophisticated &lt;a href=\"colorimetry\"&gt;colorimetry&lt;/a&gt; tools can be used if such meters are lacking.\nDesktop publishing.\nIn the desktop publishing industry, it is important to know a monitor's color temperature. Color matching software, such as Apple's &lt;a href=\"ColorSync\"&gt;ColorSync&lt;/a&gt; for Mac OS, measures a monitor's color temperature and then adjusts its settings accordingly. This enables on-screen color to more closely match printed color. Common monitor color temperatures, along with matching &lt;a href=\"standard%20illuminant\"&gt;standard illuminant&lt;/a&gt;s in parentheses, are as follows:\nD50 is scientific shorthand for a &lt;a href=\"standard%20illuminant\"&gt;standard illuminant&lt;/a&gt;: the daylight spectrum at a correlated color temperature of 5000\u00a0K. Similar definitions exist for D55, D65 and D75. Designations such as \"D50\" are used to help classify color temperatures of &lt;a href=\"light%20table\"&gt;light table&lt;/a&gt;s and viewing booths. When viewing a &lt;a href=\"Reversal%20film\"&gt;color slide&lt;/a&gt; at a light table, it is important that the light be balanced properly so that the colors are not shifted towards the red or blue.\n&lt;a href=\"Digital%20camera\"&gt;Digital camera&lt;/a&gt;s, web graphics, &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt;s, etc., are normally designed for a 6500\u00a0K color temperature. The &lt;a href=\"sRGB%20color%20space\"&gt;sRGB standard&lt;/a&gt; commonly used for images on the Internet stipulates (among other things) a 6500\u00a0K display &lt;a href=\"white%20point\"&gt;white point&lt;/a&gt;.\nTV, video, and digital still cameras.\nThe &lt;a href=\"NTSC\"&gt;NTSC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PAL\"&gt;PAL&lt;/a&gt; TV norms call for a compliant TV screen to display an electrically black and white signal (minimal color saturation) at a color temperature of 6500\u00a0K. On many consumer-grade televisions, there is a very noticeable deviation from this requirement. However, higher-end consumer-grade televisions can have their color temperatures adjusted to 6500\u00a0K by using a preprogrammed setting or a custom calibration. Current versions of &lt;a href=\"ATSC%20%28standards%29\"&gt;ATSC&lt;/a&gt; explicitly call for the color temperature data to be included in the data stream, but old versions of ATSC allowed this data to be omitted. In this case, current versions of ATSC cite default colorimetry standards depending on the format. Both of the cited standards specify a 6500\u00a0K color temperature.\nMost video and digital still cameras can adjust for color temperature by zooming into a white or neutral colored object and setting the manual \"white balance\" (telling the camera that \"this object is white\"); the camera then shows true white as white and adjusts all the other colors accordingly. White-balancing is necessary especially when indoors under fluorescent lighting and when moving the camera from one lighting situation to another. Most cameras also have an automatic white balance function that attempts to determine the color of the light and correct accordingly. While these settings were once unreliable, they are much improved in today's digital cameras and produce an accurate white balance in a wide variety of lighting situations.\nArtistic application via control of color temperature.\nVideo &lt;a href=\"camera%20operator\"&gt;camera operator&lt;/a&gt;s can white-balance objects that are not white, downplaying the color of the object used for white-balancing. For instance, they can bring more warmth into a picture by white-balancing off something that is light blue, such as faded blue denim; in this way white-balancing can replace a filter or lighting gel when those are not available.\n&lt;a href=\"Cinematographer\"&gt;Cinematographer&lt;/a&gt;s do not \"white balance\" in the same way as video camera operators; they use techniques such as filters, choice of film stock, &lt;a href=\"pre-flashing\"&gt;pre-flashing&lt;/a&gt;, and, after shooting, &lt;a href=\"color%20grading\"&gt;color grading&lt;/a&gt;, both by exposure at the labs and also digitally. Cinematographers also work closely with set designers and lighting crews to achieve the desired color effects.\nFor artists, most pigments and papers have a cool or warm cast, as the human eye can detect even a minute amount of saturation. Gray mixed with yellow, orange, or red is a \"warm gray\". Green, blue, or purple create \"cool grays\". Note that this sense of temperature is the reverse of that of real temperature; bluer is described as \"cooler\" even though it corresponds to a higher-temperature &lt;a href=\"black%20body\"&gt;black body&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Lighting%20designers\"&gt;Lighting designers&lt;/a&gt; sometimes select &lt;a href=\"filter%20%28optics%29\"&gt;filter&lt;/a&gt;s by color temperature, commonly to match light that is theoretically white. Since fixtures using &lt;a href=\"Metal%20halide%20lamp\"&gt;discharge&lt;/a&gt; type lamps produce a light of a considerably higher color temperature than do &lt;a href=\"Incandescent%20light%20bulb\"&gt;tungsten lamps&lt;/a&gt;, using the two in conjunction could potentially produce a stark contrast, so sometimes fixtures with &lt;a href=\"High-intensity%20discharge%20lamp\"&gt;HID lamps&lt;/a&gt;, commonly producing light of 6000\u20137000\u00a0K, are fitted with 3200\u00a0K filters to emulate tungsten light. Fixtures with color mixing features or with multiple colors (if including 3200\u00a0K), are also capable of producing tungsten-like light. Color temperature may also be a factor when selecting &lt;a href=\"Electric%20light\"&gt;lamps&lt;/a&gt;, since each is likely to have a different color temperature.\nCorrelated color temperature.\nMotivation.\n&lt;a href=\"Black-body\"&gt;Black-body&lt;/a&gt; radiators are the reference by which the whiteness of light sources is judged. A black body can be described by its temperature and produces light of a particular hue, as depicted above. This set of colors is called \"color temperature\". By analogy, nearly Planckian light sources such as certain &lt;a href=\"fluorescent%20lamp\"&gt;fluorescent&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"high-intensity%20discharge%20lamp\"&gt;high-intensity discharge lamp&lt;/a&gt;s can be judged by their correlated color temperature (CCT), the temperature of the Planckian radiator whose color best approximates them. For light source spectra that are not Planckian, matching them to that of a black body is not well defined; the concept of correlated color temperature was extended to map such sources as well as possible onto the one-dimensional scale of color temperature, where \"as well as possible\" is defined in the context of an objective color space.\nBackground.\nThe notion of using Planckian radiators as a yardstick against which to judge other light sources is not new. In 1923, writing about \"grading of illuminants with reference to quality of color ... the temperature of the source as an index of the quality of color\", Priest essentially described CCT as we understand it today, going so far as to use the term \"apparent color temperature\", and astutely recognized three cases:\nSeveral important developments occurred in 1931. In chronological order:\nThese developments paved the way for the development of new chromaticity spaces that are more suited to estimating correlated color temperatures and chromaticity differences. Bridging the concepts of color difference and color temperature, Priest made the observation that the eye is sensitive to constant differences in \"reciprocal\" temperature:\nPriest proposed to use \"the scale of temperature as a scale for arranging the chromaticities of the several illuminants in a serial order\". Over the next few years, Judd published three more significant papers:\nThe first verified the findings of Priest, Davis, and Judd, with a paper on sensitivity to change in color temperature.\nThe second proposed a new chromaticity space, guided by a principle that has become the holy grail of color spaces: &lt;a href=\"perceptual%20uniformity\"&gt;perceptual uniformity&lt;/a&gt; (chromaticity distance should be commensurate with perceptual difference). By means of a &lt;a href=\"projective%20transformation\"&gt;projective transformation&lt;/a&gt;, Judd found a more \"uniform chromaticity space\" (UCS) in which to find the CCT. Judd determined the \"nearest color temperature\" by simply finding the point on the &lt;a href=\"Planckian%20locus\"&gt;Planckian locus&lt;/a&gt; nearest to the chromaticity of the stimulus on &lt;a href=\"James%20Clerk%20Maxwell\"&gt;Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"color%20triangle\"&gt;color triangle&lt;/a&gt;, depicted aside. The &lt;a href=\"transformation%20matrix\"&gt;transformation matrix&lt;/a&gt; he used to convert X,Y,Z tristimulus values to R,G,B coordinates was:\nFrom this, one can find these chromaticities:\nThe third depicted the locus of the isothermal chromaticities on the CIE 1931 \"x,y\" chromaticity diagram. Since the isothermal points formed &lt;a href=\"Normal%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;normals&lt;/a&gt; on his UCS diagram, transformation back into the xy plane revealed them still to be lines, but no longer perpendicular to the locus.\nCalculation.\nJudd's idea of determining the nearest point to the Planckian locus on a uniform chromaticity space is current. In 1937, MacAdam suggested a \"modified uniform chromaticity scale diagram\", based on certain simplifying geometrical considerations:\nThis (u,v) chromaticity space became the &lt;a href=\"CIE%201960%20color%20space\"&gt;CIE 1960 color space&lt;/a&gt;, which is still used to calculate the CCT (even though MacAdam did not devise it with this purpose in mind). Using other chromaticity spaces, such as \"u'v\"', leads to non-standard results that may nevertheless be perceptually meaningful.\nThe distance from the locus (i.e., degree of departure from a black body) is traditionally indicated in units of formula_4; positive for points above the locus. This concept of distance has evolved to become &lt;a href=\"color%20difference%23Delta%20E\"&gt;Delta E&lt;/a&gt;, which continues to be used today.\nRobertson's method.\nBefore the advent of powerful &lt;a href=\"personal%20computer\"&gt;personal computer&lt;/a&gt;s, it was common to estimate the correlated color temperature by way of interpolation from look-up tables and charts. The most famous such method is Robertson's, who took advantage of the relatively even spacing of the mired scale (see above) to calculate the CCT Tc using &lt;a href=\"linear%20interpolation\"&gt;linear interpolation&lt;/a&gt; of the isotherm's mired values:\nwhere formula_6 and formula_7 are the color temperatures of the look-up isotherms and \"i\" is chosen such that formula_8. (Furthermore, the test chromaticity lies between the only two adjacent lines for which formula_9.)\nIf the isotherms are tight enough, one can assume formula_10, leading to\nThe distance of the test point to the \"i\"-th isotherm is given by\nwhere formula_13 is the chromaticity coordinate of the \"i\"-th isotherm on the Planckian locus and \"mi\" is the isotherm's &lt;a href=\"slope\"&gt;slope&lt;/a&gt;. Since it is perpendicular to the locus, it follows that formula_14 where \"li\" is the slope of the locus at formula_13.\nPrecautions.\nAlthough the CCT can be calculated for any chromaticity coordinate, the result is meaningful only if the light sources are nearly white. The CIE recommends that \"The concept of correlated color temperature should not be used if the chromaticity of the test source differs more than [formula_16] from the Planckian radiator.\"\nBeyond a certain value of formula_17, a chromaticity co-ordinate may be equidistant to two points on the locus, causing ambiguity in the CCT.\nApproximation.\nIf a narrow range of color temperatures is considered\u2014those encapsulating daylight being the most practical case\u2014one can approximate the Planckian locus in order to calculate the CCT in terms of chromaticity coordinates. Following Kelly's observation that the isotherms intersect in the purple region near (\"x\" = 0.325, \"y\" = 0.154), McCamy proposed this cubic approximation:\nwhere is the inverse slope line, and is the \"epicenter\"; quite close to the intersection point mentioned by Kelly. The maximum absolute error for color temperatures ranging from 2856\u00a0K (illuminant A) to 6504\u00a0K (&lt;a href=\"CIE%20Standard%20Illuminant%20D65\"&gt;D65&lt;/a&gt;) is under 2\u00a0K.\nA more recent proposal, using exponential terms, considerably extends the applicable range by adding a second epicenter for high color temperatures:\nwhere is as before and the other constants are defined below:\nThe author suggests that one use the low-temperature equation to determine whether the higher-temperature parameters are needed.\nThe inverse calculation, from color temperature to corresponding chromaticity coordinates, is discussed in .\nColor rendering index.\nThe &lt;a href=\"International%20Commission%20on%20Illumination\"&gt;CIE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"color%20rendering%20index\"&gt;color rendering index&lt;/a&gt; (CRI) is a method to determine how well a light source's illumination of eight sample patches compares to the illumination provided by a reference source. Cited together, the CRI and CCT give a numerical estimate of what reference (ideal) light source best approximates a particular artificial light, and what the difference is. See &lt;a href=\"Color%20rendering%20index\"&gt;Color Rendering Index&lt;/a&gt; for full article.\nSpectral power distribution.\nLight sources and illuminants may be characterized by their &lt;a href=\"spectral%20power%20distribution\"&gt;spectral power distribution&lt;/a&gt; (SPD). The relative SPD curves provided by many manufacturers may have been produced using 10\u00a0&lt;a href=\"nanometer\"&gt;nm&lt;/a&gt; increments or more on their &lt;a href=\"spectroradiometer\"&gt;spectroradiometer&lt;/a&gt;. The result is what would seem to be a smoother (\"&lt;a href=\"full-spectrum%20light\"&gt;fuller spectrum&lt;/a&gt;\") power distribution than the lamp actually has. Owing to their spiky distribution, much finer increments are advisable for taking measurements of fluorescent lights, and this requires more expensive equipment.\nColor temperature in astronomy.\nIn &lt;a href=\"astronomy\"&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, the color temperature is defined by the local slope of the SPD at a given wavelength, or, in practice, a wavelength range. Given, for example, the &lt;a href=\"UBV%20photometric%20system\"&gt;color magnitudes&lt;/a&gt; \"B\" and \"V\" which are calibrated to be equal for an &lt;a href=\"A-type%20main%20sequence%20star\"&gt;A0V star&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Vega\"&gt;Vega&lt;/a&gt;), the stellar color temperature formula_20 is given by the temperature for which the color index formula_21 of a black-body radiator fits the stellar one. Besides the formula_21, other color indices can be used as well. The color temperature (as well as the correlated color temperature defined above) may differ largely from the effective temperature given by the radiative flux of the stellar surface. For example, the color temperature of an A0V star is about 15000 K compared to an effective temperature of about 9500 K. For most applications in astronomy (e.g., to place a star on the &lt;a href=\"Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram\"&gt;HR diagram&lt;/a&gt; or to determine the temperature of a model flux fitting an observed spectrum) the &lt;a href=\"effective%20temperature\"&gt;effective temperature&lt;/a&gt; is the quantity of interest. Various colour-effective temperature relations exist in the literature. There relations also have smaller dependencies on other stellar parameters, such as the stellar metallicity and surface gravity "
