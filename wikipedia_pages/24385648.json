    "text": "List of the &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29\"&gt;cardinals&lt;/a&gt; attested in the contemporary sources during the period of &lt;a href=\"Saeculum%20obscurum\"&gt;pornocracy&lt;/a&gt; (904 \u2013 964) and later until the election of Pope John XV in August 985. It certainly contains only small part of all cardinals living at that time because only small number of documents and other accounts useful for the reconstruction of that list have been preserved to our times.\nThe dates in the parentheses mark the first and last time when the cardinal appears in the sources.\nCardinal-bishops.\nNote: &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Sabina\"&gt;diocese of Sabina&lt;/a&gt; became a &lt;a href=\"suburbicarian%20see\"&gt;suburbicarian see&lt;/a&gt; only in 1063. Although some of its bishops in the 10th century are known by name, they should not be included in the list of cardinals.\n\"Presumed cardinals\".\nNumerous writers from the 16th century onwards, including &lt;a href=\"Alphonsus%20Ciacconius\"&gt;Alphonsus Ciacconius&lt;/a&gt; (1540\u20131599), &lt;a href=\"Lorenzo%20Cardella\"&gt;Lorenzo Cardella&lt;/a&gt; etc. have mentioned several other cardinals ostensibly created during this period, which, however, for various reasons should be either eliminated from that list or classified as dubious (\"presumed cardinals\"). They can be divided in four subsequent categories.\nAuthentic persons, whose cardinalate is not proven.\nNote: in some cases it is possible that the promotion really took place; however, there is no evidence to ascertain it:\nCardinals not attested in the contemporary sources.\nThe following cardinals allegedly promoted in 10th century up to date have not been identified in the published documents from the Roman registers:\nFictitious individuals.\nTwo cardinals, ostensibly elected to the papacy, are fictitious persons which owe their existence an onomastic confusion\nThey both are not listed in the official series of Popes in &lt;a href=\"Annuario%20Pontificio\"&gt;Annuario Pontificio&lt;/a&gt;.\nCardinals known only from the false documents.\nSome documents which bear the subscriptions of the cardinals have been recognized as falsehoods and although some authors unaware of this fact used them as sources for the reconstruction of the catalogue of cardinals in the 10th century, they are useless for this purpose:"
