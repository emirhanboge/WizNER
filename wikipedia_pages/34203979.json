    "text": "Crescent Dawn is a &lt;a href=\"Dirk%20Pitt\"&gt;Dirk Pitt&lt;/a&gt; novel, the twenty-first of that series. The hardcover edition was released November 16, 2010. Other editions were released on earlier dates.\nPlot.\nAs are most Dirk Pitt novels, the story begins with one or more historical prologues: an attack on a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"galley\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; in 327 AD, and an episode in 1916 in which a &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; warship mysteriously explodes and sinks in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;. In the present, important mosques in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; are damaged by planted explosives. While doing underwater explorations off Turkey and on the &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i coasts, Dirk Pitt and &lt;a href=\"Dirk%20Pitt%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Dirk Pitt, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, face villainous characters who cause them both to become involved in uncovering a plot to resurrect the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Pitt\"&gt;Summer Pitt&lt;/a&gt;, the elder Pitt's daughter, stumbles upon a manifest in England that dates to the time of Jesus and sheds new light on early Christianity. The Pitts and &lt;a href=\"National%20Underwater%20and%20Marine%20Agency\"&gt;NUMA&lt;/a&gt;, for whom they work, become involved in action-packed episodes throughout the book. Clive Cussler makes two cameo appearances in this book, as he has a habit of doing in many of his novels."
