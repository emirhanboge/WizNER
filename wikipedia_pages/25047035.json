    "text": "USS \"Dolphin\" (SP-262) was the proposed name and designation for a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"patrol%20vessel\"&gt;patrol vessel&lt;/a&gt; that the Navy never actually acquired.\n\"Dolphin\" was built as the commercial &lt;a href=\"steam\"&gt;steam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fishing%20vessel\"&gt;fishing vessel&lt;/a&gt; \"Virginia\" at &lt;a href=\"Pocomoke%20City%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Pocomoke City, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. She was of the \"&lt;a href=\"menhaden%20fisherman\"&gt;menhaden fisherman&lt;/a&gt;\" design. She was rebuilt in 1911, and at some point between 1908 and 1917 was renamed \"Dolphin\".\nThe U.S. Navy considered acquiring \"Dolphin\" in 1917 for &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; service as a patrol vessel and assigned her the &lt;a href=\"section%20patrol\"&gt;section patrol&lt;/a&gt; number SP-318. Although reported by some contemporary sources as having been placed in &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt; in February 1919 as USS \"Dolphin\" (SP-318), she in fact appears never to have been acquired by the Navy and to have remained in &lt;a href=\"civilian\"&gt;civilian&lt;/a&gt; hands.\n\"Dolphin\" should not be confused with &lt;a href=\"USS%20Dolphin%20%28PG-24%29\"&gt;USS \"Dolphin\" (Gunboat No. 24)&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"gunboat\"&gt;gunboat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dispatch%20vessel\"&gt;dispatch vessel&lt;/a&gt; in commission at the time, or with , a patrol vessel in commission during 1918."
