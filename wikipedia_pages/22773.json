    "text": "Oxidative phosphorylation (UK , US ) or electron transport-linked phosphorylation or terminal oxidation is the &lt;a href=\"metabolic%20pathway\"&gt;metabolic pathway&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href=\"Cell%20%28biology%29\"&gt;cell&lt;/a&gt;s use &lt;a href=\"enzyme\"&gt;enzyme&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Redox\"&gt;oxidize&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nutrient\"&gt;nutrient&lt;/a&gt;s, thereby releasing chemical energy in order to produce &lt;a href=\"adenosine%20triphosphate\"&gt;adenosine triphosphate&lt;/a&gt; (ATP). In &lt;a href=\"eukaryotes\"&gt;eukaryotes&lt;/a&gt;, this takes place inside &lt;a href=\"mitochondria\"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;. Almost all &lt;a href=\"aerobic%20organism\"&gt;aerobic organism&lt;/a&gt;s carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is so pervasive because it releases more energy (provided by &lt;a href=\"Dioxygen%20in%20biological%20reactions\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt;) than alternative &lt;a href=\"fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29\"&gt;fermentation&lt;/a&gt; processes such as &lt;a href=\"Anaerobic%20organism\"&gt;anaerobic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"glycolysis\"&gt;glycolysis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe energy stored in the chemical bonds of &lt;a href=\"glucose\"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; is released by the cell in the &lt;a href=\"citric%20acid%20cycle\"&gt;citric acid cycle&lt;/a&gt; producing carbon dioxide, and the energetic &lt;a href=\"reducing%20agent\"&gt;electron donors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"NADH\"&gt;NADH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FADH\"&gt;FADH&lt;/a&gt;. Oxidative phosphorylation uses these molecules and O2 to &lt;a href=\"ATP%20synthase\"&gt;produce ATP&lt;/a&gt;, which is used throughout the cell whenever energy is needed. During oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are transferred from the electron donors to a series of &lt;a href=\"oxidizing%20agent\"&gt;electron acceptors&lt;/a&gt; in a series of &lt;a href=\"redox%20reaction\"&gt;redox reaction&lt;/a&gt;s ending in oxygen, whose reaction releases half of the total energy.\nIn &lt;a href=\"eukaryote\"&gt;eukaryote&lt;/a&gt;s, these redox reactions are catalyzed by a series of &lt;a href=\"protein%20complex\"&gt;protein complex&lt;/a&gt;es within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, whereas, in &lt;a href=\"prokaryote\"&gt;prokaryote&lt;/a&gt;s, these proteins are located in the cell's outer membrane. These linked sets of proteins are called the &lt;a href=\"electron%20transport%20chain\"&gt;electron transport chain&lt;/a&gt;. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of electron donors and acceptors.\nThe energy transferred by electrons flowing through this electron transport chain is used to transport &lt;a href=\"proton\"&gt;proton&lt;/a&gt;s across the &lt;a href=\"inner%20mitochondrial%20membrane\"&gt;inner mitochondrial membrane&lt;/a&gt;, in a process called \"&lt;a href=\"electron%20transport\"&gt;electron transport&lt;/a&gt;\". This generates &lt;a href=\"potential%20energy\"&gt;potential energy&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a &lt;a href=\"pH\"&gt;pH&lt;/a&gt; gradient and an &lt;a href=\"Membrane%20potential\"&gt;electrical potential&lt;/a&gt; across this membrane. This store of energy is tapped when protons flow back across the membrane and down the potential energy gradient, through a large enzyme called &lt;a href=\"ATP%20synthase\"&gt;ATP synthase&lt;/a&gt; in a process called &lt;a href=\"chemiosmosis\"&gt;chemiosmosis&lt;/a&gt;. The ATP synthase uses the energy to transform &lt;a href=\"adenosine%20diphosphate\"&gt;adenosine diphosphate&lt;/a&gt; (ADP) into adenosine triphosphate, in a &lt;a href=\"phosphorylation\"&gt;phosphorylation&lt;/a&gt; reaction. The reaction is driven by the proton flow, which forces the &lt;a href=\"rotation\"&gt;rotation&lt;/a&gt; of a part of the enzyme. The ATP synthase is a rotary mechanical motor.\nAlthough oxidative phosphorylation is a vital part of metabolism, it produces &lt;a href=\"reactive%20oxygen%20species\"&gt;reactive oxygen species&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"superoxide\"&gt;superoxide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20peroxide\"&gt;hydrogen peroxide&lt;/a&gt;, which lead to propagation of &lt;a href=\"Radical%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;free radicals&lt;/a&gt;, damaging cells and contributing to &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; and, possibly, &lt;a href=\"aging\"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"senescence\"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt;. The enzymes carrying out this metabolic pathway are also the target of many drugs and poisons that &lt;a href=\"enzyme%20inhibitor\"&gt;inhibit&lt;/a&gt; their activities.\nChemiosmosis.\nOxidative phosphorylation works by using &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions. The two sets of reactions are said to be \"coupled\". This means one cannot occur without the other. The chain of redox reactions driving the flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as &lt;a href=\"NADH\"&gt;NADH&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"electron%20acceptor\"&gt;electron acceptor&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; and hydrogen (protons), is an &lt;a href=\"exergonic\"&gt;exergonic&lt;/a&gt; process\u00a0\u2013 it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an &lt;a href=\"endergonic\"&gt;endergonic&lt;/a&gt; process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from the electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called \"&lt;a href=\"chemiosmosis\"&gt;chemiosmosis&lt;/a&gt;\". A current of protons is driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side through the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. The movement of protons creates an &lt;a href=\"electrochemical%20gradient\"&gt;electrochemical gradient&lt;/a&gt; across the membrane, which is often called the \"proton-motive force\". It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, \u0394&lt;a href=\"pH\"&gt;pH&lt;/a&gt;) and a difference in &lt;a href=\"electric%20potential\"&gt;electric potential&lt;/a&gt;, with the N-side having a negative charge.\nATP synthase releases this stored energy by completing the circuit and allowing protons to flow down the electrochemical gradient, back to the N-side of the membrane. The electrochemical gradient drives the rotation of part of the enzyme's structure and couples this motion to the synthesis of ATP.\nThe two components of the proton-motive force are &lt;a href=\"thermodynamic\"&gt;thermodynamic&lt;/a&gt;ally equivalent: In mitochondria, the largest part of energy is provided by the potential; in &lt;a href=\"alkaliphile\"&gt;alkaliphile&lt;/a&gt; bacteria the electrical energy even has to compensate for a counteracting inverse pH difference. Inversely, &lt;a href=\"chloroplast\"&gt;chloroplast&lt;/a&gt;s operate mainly on \u0394pH. However, they also require a small membrane potential for the kinetics of ATP synthesis. In the case of the &lt;a href=\"Fusobacteria\"&gt;fusobacterium&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Propionigenium%20modestum\"&gt;Propionigenium modestum&lt;/a&gt;\" it drives the counter-rotation of subunits a and c of the FO motor of ATP synthase.\nThe amount of energy released by oxidative phosphorylation is high, compared with the amount produced by &lt;a href=\"anaerobic%20fermentation\"&gt;anaerobic fermentation&lt;/a&gt;, due to the high energy of O2. &lt;a href=\"Glycolysis\"&gt;Glycolysis&lt;/a&gt; produces only 2 ATP molecules, but somewhere between 30 and 36 ATPs are produced by the oxidative phosphorylation of the 10 NADH and 2 succinate molecules made by converting one molecule of &lt;a href=\"glucose\"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; to carbon dioxide and water, while each cycle of &lt;a href=\"beta%20oxidation\"&gt;beta oxidation&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"fatty%20acid\"&gt;fatty acid&lt;/a&gt; yields about 14 ATPs. These ATP yields are theoretical maximum values; in practice, some protons leak across the membrane, lowering the yield of ATP.\nElectron and proton transfer molecules.\nThe electron transport chain carries both protons and electrons, passing electrons from donors to acceptors, and transporting protons across a membrane. These processes use both soluble and protein-bound transfer molecules. In mitochondria, electrons are transferred within the intermembrane space by the water-&lt;a href=\"soluble\"&gt;soluble&lt;/a&gt; electron transfer protein &lt;a href=\"cytochrome%20c\"&gt;cytochrome c&lt;/a&gt;. This carries only electrons, and these are transferred by the reduction and oxidation of an &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; atom that the protein holds within a &lt;a href=\"heme\"&gt;heme&lt;/a&gt; group in its structure. Cytochrome c is also found in some bacteria, where it is located within the &lt;a href=\"periplasmic%20space\"&gt;periplasmic space&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the inner mitochondrial membrane, the &lt;a href=\"lipid\"&gt;lipid&lt;/a&gt;-soluble electron carrier &lt;a href=\"coenzyme%20Q10\"&gt;coenzyme Q10&lt;/a&gt; (Q) carries both electrons and protons by a &lt;a href=\"redox\"&gt;redox&lt;/a&gt; cycle. This small &lt;a href=\"1%2C4-Benzoquinone\"&gt;benzoquinone&lt;/a&gt; molecule is very &lt;a href=\"hydrophobe\"&gt;hydrophobic&lt;/a&gt;, so it diffuses freely within the membrane. When Q accepts two electrons and two protons, it becomes reduced to the \"&lt;a href=\"Hydroquinone\"&gt;ubiquinol&lt;/a&gt;\" form (QH2); when QH2 releases two electrons and two protons, it becomes oxidized back to the \"ubiquinone\" (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced on one side of the membrane and QH2 oxidized on the other, ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across the membrane. Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20K\"&gt;menaquinone&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to ubiquinone.\nWithin proteins, electrons are transferred between &lt;a href=\"Flavin%20group\"&gt;flavin&lt;/a&gt; cofactors, &lt;a href=\"iron%E2%80%93sulfur%20cluster\"&gt;iron\u2013sulfur cluster&lt;/a&gt;s and cytochromes. There are several types of iron\u2013sulfur cluster. The simplest kind found in the electron transfer chain consists of two iron atoms joined by two atoms of inorganic &lt;a href=\"sulfur\"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt;; these are called [2Fe\u20132S] clusters. The second kind, called [4Fe\u20134S], contains a cube of four iron atoms and four sulfur atoms. Each iron atom in these clusters is coordinated by an additional &lt;a href=\"amino%20acid\"&gt;amino acid&lt;/a&gt;, usually by the sulfur atom of &lt;a href=\"cysteine\"&gt;cysteine&lt;/a&gt;. Metal ion cofactors undergo redox reactions without binding or releasing protons, so in the electron transport chain they serve solely to transport electrons through proteins. Electrons move quite long distances through proteins by hopping along chains of these cofactors. This occurs by &lt;a href=\"quantum%20tunnelling\"&gt;quantum tunnelling&lt;/a&gt;, which is rapid over distances of less than 1.4 m.\nEukaryotic electron transport chains.\nMany &lt;a href=\"catabolic\"&gt;catabolic&lt;/a&gt; biochemical processes, such as &lt;a href=\"glycolysis\"&gt;glycolysis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"citric%20acid%20cycle\"&gt;citric acid cycle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"beta%20oxidation\"&gt;beta oxidation&lt;/a&gt;, produce the reduced &lt;a href=\"Cofactor%20%28biochemistry%29\"&gt;coenzyme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"NADH\"&gt;NADH&lt;/a&gt;. This coenzyme contains electrons that have a high &lt;a href=\"Standard%20electrode%20potential\"&gt;transfer potential&lt;/a&gt;; in other words, they will release a large amount of energy upon oxidation. However, the cell does not release this energy all at once, as this would be an uncontrollable reaction. Instead, the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy. This set of enzymes, consisting of complexes I through IV, is called the electron transport chain and is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. &lt;a href=\"succinic%20acid\"&gt;Succinate&lt;/a&gt; is also oxidized by the electron transport chain, but feeds into the pathway at a different point.\nIn &lt;a href=\"eukaryote\"&gt;eukaryote&lt;/a&gt;s, the enzymes in this electron transport system use the energy released from O2 by NADH to pump &lt;a href=\"proton\"&gt;proton&lt;/a&gt;s across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. This causes protons to build up in the &lt;a href=\"intermembrane%20space\"&gt;intermembrane space&lt;/a&gt;, and generates an &lt;a href=\"electrochemical%20gradient\"&gt;electrochemical gradient&lt;/a&gt; across the membrane. The energy stored in this potential is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation in the eukaryotic mitochondrion is the best-understood example of this process. The mitochondrion is present in almost all eukaryotes, with the exception of anaerobic protozoa such as \"&lt;a href=\"Trichomonas%20vaginalis\"&gt;Trichomonas vaginalis&lt;/a&gt;\" that instead reduce protons to hydrogen in a remnant mitochondrion called a &lt;a href=\"hydrogenosome\"&gt;hydrogenosome&lt;/a&gt;.\nNADH-coenzyme Q oxidoreductase (complex I).\n&lt;a href=\"NADH%20dehydrogenase\"&gt;NADH-coenzyme Q oxidoreductase&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"NADH dehydrogenase\" or \"complex I\", is the first protein in the electron transport chain. Complex I is a giant &lt;a href=\"enzyme\"&gt;enzyme&lt;/a&gt; with the mammalian complex I having 46 subunits and a molecular mass of about 1,000 &lt;a href=\"atomic%20mass%20unit\"&gt;kilodaltons&lt;/a&gt; (kDa). The structure is known in detail only from a bacterium; in most organisms the complex resembles a boot with a large \"ball\" poking out from the membrane into the mitochondrion. The genes that encode the individual proteins are contained in both the &lt;a href=\"cell%20nucleus\"&gt;cell nucleus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"mitochondrial%20genome\"&gt;mitochondrial genome&lt;/a&gt;, as is the case for many enzymes present in the mitochondrion.\nThe reaction that is catalyzed by this enzyme is the two electron oxidation of &lt;a href=\"Nicotinamide%20adenine%20dinucleotide\"&gt;NADH&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"coenzyme%20Q10\"&gt;coenzyme Q10&lt;/a&gt; or \"ubiquinone\" (represented as Q in the equation below), a lipid-soluble &lt;a href=\"quinone\"&gt;quinone&lt;/a&gt; that is found in the mitochondrion membrane:\nThe start of the reaction, and indeed of the entire electron chain, is the binding of a NADH molecule to complex I and the donation of two electrons. The electrons enter complex I via a &lt;a href=\"prosthetic%20group\"&gt;prosthetic group&lt;/a&gt; attached to the complex, &lt;a href=\"flavin%20mononucleotide\"&gt;flavin mononucleotide&lt;/a&gt; (FMN). The addition of electrons to FMN converts it to its reduced form, FMNH2. The electrons are then transferred through a series of iron\u2013sulfur clusters: the second kind of prosthetic group present in the complex. There are both [2Fe\u20132S] and [4Fe\u20134S] iron\u2013sulfur clusters in complex I.\nAs the electrons pass through this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, but it seems to involve &lt;a href=\"conformational%20change\"&gt;conformational change&lt;/a&gt;s in complex I that cause the protein to bind protons on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, the electrons are transferred from the chain of iron\u2013sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to &lt;a href=\"ubiquinol\"&gt;ubiquinol&lt;/a&gt; (QH2).\nSuccinate-Q oxidoreductase (complex II).\n&lt;a href=\"Succinate%20-%20coenzyme%20Q%20reductase\"&gt;Succinate-Q oxidoreductase&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"complex II\" or \"succinate dehydrogenase\", is a second entry point to the electron transport chain. It is unusual because it is the only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound &lt;a href=\"flavin%20adenine%20dinucleotide\"&gt;flavin adenine dinucleotide&lt;/a&gt; (FAD) cofactor, iron\u2013sulfur clusters, and a &lt;a href=\"heme\"&gt;heme&lt;/a&gt; group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes &lt;a href=\"succinic%20acid\"&gt;succinate&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fumaric%20acid\"&gt;fumarate&lt;/a&gt; and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.\nIn some eukaryotes, such as the &lt;a href=\"parasitic%20worm\"&gt;parasitic worm&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Large%20roundworm%20of%20pigs\"&gt;Ascaris suum&lt;/a&gt;\", an enzyme similar to complex II, fumarate reductase (menaquinol:fumarate\noxidoreductase, or QFR), operates in reverse to oxidize ubiquinol and reduce fumarate. This allows the worm to survive in the anaerobic environment of the &lt;a href=\"large%20intestine\"&gt;large intestine&lt;/a&gt;, carrying out anaerobic oxidative phosphorylation with fumarate as the electron acceptor. Another unconventional function of complex II is seen in the &lt;a href=\"malaria\"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; parasite \"&lt;a href=\"Plasmodium%20falciparum\"&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/a&gt;\". Here, the reversed action of complex II as an oxidase is important in regenerating ubiquinol, which the parasite uses in an unusual form of &lt;a href=\"pyrimidine\"&gt;pyrimidine&lt;/a&gt; biosynthesis.\nElectron transfer flavoprotein-Q oxidoreductase.\n&lt;a href=\"Electron-transferring-flavoprotein%20dehydrogenase\"&gt;Electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase&lt;/a&gt; (ETF-Q oxidoreductase), also known as \"electron transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase\", is a third entry point to the electron transport chain. It is an enzyme that accepts electrons from &lt;a href=\"electron-transferring%20flavoprotein\"&gt;electron-transferring flavoprotein&lt;/a&gt; in the mitochondrial matrix, and uses these electrons to reduce ubiquinone. This enzyme contains a &lt;a href=\"Flavin%20group\"&gt;flavin&lt;/a&gt; and a [4Fe\u20134S] cluster, but, unlike the other respiratory complexes, it attaches to the surface of the membrane and does not cross the lipid bilayer.\nIn mammals, this metabolic pathway is important in &lt;a href=\"beta%20oxidation\"&gt;beta oxidation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"fatty%20acid\"&gt;fatty acid&lt;/a&gt;s and catabolism of &lt;a href=\"amino%20acid\"&gt;amino acid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"choline\"&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt;, as it accepts electrons from multiple &lt;a href=\"acetyl-CoA\"&gt;acetyl-CoA&lt;/a&gt; dehydrogenases. In plants, ETF-Q oxidoreductase is also important in the metabolic responses that allow survival in extended periods of darkness.\nQ-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III).\n&lt;a href=\"Coenzyme%20Q%20-%20cytochrome%20c%20reductase\"&gt;Q-cytochrome c oxidoreductase&lt;/a&gt; is also known as \"cytochrome c reductase\", \"cytochrome bc1 complex\", or simply \"complex III\". In mammals, this enzyme is a &lt;a href=\"protein%20dimer\"&gt;dimer&lt;/a&gt;, with each subunit complex containing 11 protein subunits, an [2Fe-2S] iron\u2013sulfur cluster and three &lt;a href=\"cytochrome\"&gt;cytochrome&lt;/a&gt;s: one &lt;a href=\"cytochrome\"&gt;cytochrome&lt;/a&gt; c1 and two b &lt;a href=\"cytochromes\"&gt;cytochromes&lt;/a&gt;. A cytochrome is a kind of electron-transferring protein that contains at least one &lt;a href=\"heme\"&gt;heme&lt;/a&gt; group. The iron atoms inside complex III's heme groups alternate between a reduced ferrous (+2) and oxidized ferric (+3) state as the electrons are transferred through the protein.\nThe reaction catalyzed by complex III is the oxidation of one molecule of &lt;a href=\"ubiquinol\"&gt;ubiquinol&lt;/a&gt; and the reduction of two molecules of &lt;a href=\"cytochrome%20c\"&gt;cytochrome c&lt;/a&gt;, a heme protein loosely associated with the mitochondrion. Unlike coenzyme Q, which carries two electrons, cytochrome c carries only one electron.\nAs only one of the electrons can be transferred from the QH2 donor to a cytochrome c acceptor at a time, the reaction mechanism of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes, and occurs in two steps called the &lt;a href=\"Q%20cycle\"&gt;Q cycle&lt;/a&gt;. In the first step, the enzyme binds three substrates, first, QH2, which is then oxidized, with one electron being passed to the second substrate, cytochrome c. The two protons released from QH2 pass into the intermembrane space. The third substrate is Q, which accepts the second electron from the QH2 and is reduced to Q.\u2212, which is the &lt;a href=\"semiquinone\"&gt;ubisemiquinone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"free%20radical\"&gt;free radical&lt;/a&gt;. The first two substrates are released, but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound. In the second step, a second molecule of QH2 is bound and again passes its first electron to a cytochrome c acceptor. The second electron is passed to the bound ubisemiquinone, reducing it to QH2 as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix. This QH2 is then released from the enzyme.\nAs coenzyme Q is reduced to ubiquinol on the inner side of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.\nCytochrome c oxidase (complex IV).\n&lt;a href=\"Cytochrome%20c%20oxidase\"&gt;Cytochrome c oxidase&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"complex IV\", is the final protein complex in the electron transport chain. The mammalian enzyme has an extremely complicated structure and contains 13 subunits, two heme groups, as well as multiple metal ion cofactors\u00a0\u2013 in all, three atoms of &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href=\"magnesium\"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; and one of &lt;a href=\"zinc\"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis enzyme mediates the final reaction in the electron transport chain and transfers electrons to oxygen and hydrogen (protons), while pumping protons across the membrane. The final &lt;a href=\"electron%20acceptor\"&gt;electron acceptor&lt;/a&gt; oxygen, which provides most of the energy released in the electron transfer chain and is also called the \"terminal electron acceptor\", is reduced to water in this step, which releases half of all the energy in aerobic respiration. Both the direct pumping of protons and the consumption of matrix protons in the reduction of oxygen contribute to the proton gradient. The reaction catalyzed is the oxidation of cytochrome c and the reduction of oxygen:\nAlternative reductases and oxidases.\nMany eukaryotic organisms have electron transport chains that differ from the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s have alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol rather than in the mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.\nAnother example of a divergent electron transport chain is the \"&lt;a href=\"alternative%20oxidase\"&gt;alternative oxidase&lt;/a&gt;\", which is found in &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as some &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"protist\"&gt;protist&lt;/a&gt;s, and possibly some animals. This enzyme transfers electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen.\nThe electron transport pathways produced by these alternative NADH and ubiquinone oxidases have lower &lt;a href=\"adenosine%20triphosphate\"&gt;ATP&lt;/a&gt; yields than the full pathway. The advantages produced by a shortened pathway are not entirely clear. However, the alternative oxidase is produced in response to stresses such as cold, &lt;a href=\"reactive%20oxygen%20species\"&gt;reactive oxygen species&lt;/a&gt;, and infection by pathogens, as well as other factors that inhibit the full electron transport chain. Alternative pathways might, therefore, enhance an organisms' resistance to injury, by reducing &lt;a href=\"oxidative%20stress\"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization of complexes.\nThe original model for how the respiratory chain complexes are organized was that they diffuse freely and independently in the mitochondrial membrane. However, recent data suggest that the complexes might form higher-order structures called supercomplexes or \"&lt;a href=\"respirasome\"&gt;respirasome&lt;/a&gt;s\". In this model, the various complexes exist as organized sets of interacting enzymes. These associations might allow channeling of substrates between the various enzyme complexes, increasing the rate and efficiency of electron transfer. Within such mammalian supercomplexes, some components would be present in higher amounts than others, with some data suggesting a ratio between complexes I/II/III/IV and the ATP synthase of approximately 1:1:3:7:4. However, the debate over this supercomplex hypothesis is not completely resolved, as some data do not appear to fit with this model.\nProkaryotic electron transport chains.\nIn contrast to the general similarity in structure and function of the electron transport chains in eukaryotes, &lt;a href=\"bacteria\"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"archaea\"&gt;archaea&lt;/a&gt; possess a large variety of electron-transfer enzymes. These use an equally wide set of chemicals as substrates. In common with eukaryotes, prokaryotic electron transport uses the energy released from the oxidation of a substrate to pump ions across a membrane and generate an electrochemical gradient. In the bacteria, oxidative phosphorylation in \"&lt;a href=\"Escherichia%20coli\"&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/a&gt;\" is understood in most detail, while archaeal systems are at present poorly understood.\nThe main difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic oxidative phosphorylation is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under a wide variety of environmental conditions. In \"E. coli\", for example, oxidative phosphorylation can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The &lt;a href=\"Standard%20electrode%20potential%23Non-standard%20condition\"&gt;midpoint potential&lt;/a&gt; of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.\nAs shown above, \"E. coli\" can grow with reducing agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger the difference in midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate can be reduced to succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by &lt;a href=\"Succinate%20-%20coenzyme%20Q%20reductase\"&gt;succinate dehydrogenase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fumarate%20reductase\"&gt;fumarate reductase&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nSome prokaryotes use redox pairs that have only a small difference in midpoint potential. For example, &lt;a href=\"nitrification\"&gt;nitrifying&lt;/a&gt; bacteria such as \"&lt;a href=\"Nitrobacter\"&gt;Nitrobacter&lt;/a&gt;\" oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in &lt;a href=\"anabolism\"&gt;anabolism&lt;/a&gt;. This problem is solved by using a &lt;a href=\"nitrite%20oxidoreductase\"&gt;nitrite oxidoreductase&lt;/a&gt; to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.\nProkaryotes control their use of these electron donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response to environmental conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool. This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together, linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a &lt;a href=\"modular%20design\"&gt;modular design&lt;/a&gt;, with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.\nIn addition to this metabolic diversity, prokaryotes also possess a range of &lt;a href=\"isozyme\"&gt;isozyme&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0\u2013 different enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. For example, in \"E. coli\", there are two different types of ubiquinol oxidase using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Under highly aerobic conditions, the cell uses an oxidase with a low affinity for oxygen that can transport two protons per electron. However, if levels of oxygen fall, they switch to an oxidase that transfers only one proton per electron, but has a high affinity for oxygen.\nATP synthase (complex V).\nATP synthase, also called \"complex V\", is the final enzyme in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. This enzyme is found in all forms of life and functions in the same way in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The enzyme uses the energy stored in a proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and &lt;a href=\"phosphate\"&gt;phosphate&lt;/a&gt; (Pi). Estimates of the number of protons required to synthesize one ATP have ranged from three to four, with some suggesting cells can vary this ratio, to suit different conditions.\nThis &lt;a href=\"phosphorylation\"&gt;phosphorylation&lt;/a&gt; reaction is an &lt;a href=\"chemical%20equilibrium\"&gt;equilibrium&lt;/a&gt;, which can be shifted by altering the proton-motive force. In the absence of a proton-motive force, the ATP synthase reaction will run from right to left, hydrolyzing ATP and pumping protons out of the matrix across the membrane. However, when the proton-motive force is high, the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction; it proceeds from left to right, allowing protons to flow down their concentration gradient and turning ADP into ATP. Indeed, in the closely related &lt;a href=\"V-ATPase\"&gt;vacuolar type H+-ATPases&lt;/a&gt;, the hydrolysis reaction is used to acidify cellular compartments, by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP.\nATP synthase is a massive protein complex with a mushroom-like shape. The mammalian enzyme complex contains 16 subunits and has a mass of approximately 600 &lt;a href=\"kilodalton\"&gt;kilodalton&lt;/a&gt;s. The portion embedded within the membrane is called FO and contains a ring of c subunits and the proton channel. The stalk and the ball-shaped headpiece is called F1 and is the site of ATP synthesis. The ball-shaped complex at the end of the F1 portion contains six proteins of two different kinds (three \u03b1 subunits and three \u03b2 subunits), whereas the \"stalk\" consists of one protein: the \u03b3 subunit, with the tip of the stalk extending into the ball of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Both the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits bind nucleotides, but only the \u03b2 subunits catalyze the ATP synthesis reaction. Reaching along the side of the F1 portion and back into the membrane is a long rod-like subunit that anchors the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits into the base of the enzyme.\nAs protons cross the membrane through the channel in the base of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the &lt;a href=\"ionization\"&gt;ionization&lt;/a&gt; of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing &lt;a href=\"electrostatic\"&gt;electrostatic&lt;/a&gt; interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central &lt;a href=\"axle\"&gt;axle&lt;/a&gt; (the \u03b3 subunit stalk) within the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. The \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a &lt;a href=\"stator\"&gt;stator&lt;/a&gt;. This movement of the tip of the \u03b3 subunit within the ball of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the \u03b2 subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.\nThis ATP synthesis reaction is called the \"binding change mechanism\" and involves the active site of a \u03b2 subunit cycling between three states. In the \"open\" state, ADP and phosphate enter the active site (shown in brown in the diagram). The protein then closes up around the molecules and binds them loosely\u00a0\u2013 the \"loose\" state (shown in red). The enzyme then changes shape again and forces these molecules together, with the active site in the resulting \"tight\" state (shown in pink) binding the newly produced ATP molecule with very high &lt;a href=\"Dissociation%20constant\"&gt;affinity&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the active site cycles back to the open state, releasing ATP and binding more ADP and phosphate, ready for the next cycle.\nIn some bacteria and archaea, ATP synthesis is driven by the movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane, rather than the movement of protons. Archaea such as \"&lt;a href=\"Methanococcus\"&gt;Methanococcus&lt;/a&gt;\" also contain the A1Ao synthase, a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible that, in some species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but this might not be true in all cases.\nOxidative phosphorylation - energetics.\nThe energy released in oxidative phosphorylation can mostly be attributed to O2 with its relatively weak double bond. The transport of electrons from redox pair NAD+/ NADH to the final redox pair 1/2 O2/ H2O can be summarized as\n1/2 O2 + NADH + H+ \u2192 H2O + NAD+\nThe potential difference between these two redox pairs is 1.14 volt, which is equivalent to -52 kcal/mol or -2600 kJ per 6\u00a0mol of O2.\nWhen one NADH is oxidized through the electron transfer chain, three ATPs are produced, which is equivalent to 7.3 kcal/mol x 3 = 21.9 kcal/mol.\nThe conservation of the energy can be calculated by the following formula\nEfficiency = (21.9 x 100%) / 52 = 42%\nSo we can conclude that when NADH is oxidized, about 42% of energy is conserved in the form of three ATPs and the remaining (58%) energy is lost as heat (unless the chemical energy of ATP under physiological conditions was underestimated).\nReactive oxygen species.\nMolecular oxygen is an ideal terminal &lt;a href=\"electron%20acceptor\"&gt;electron acceptor&lt;/a&gt; because it is a strong oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates. Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is harmless, transfer of one or two electrons produces &lt;a href=\"superoxide\"&gt;superoxide&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"peroxide\"&gt;peroxide&lt;/a&gt; anions, which are dangerously reactive.\nThese &lt;a href=\"reactive%20oxygen%20species\"&gt;reactive oxygen species&lt;/a&gt; and their reaction products, such as the &lt;a href=\"hydroxyl\"&gt;hydroxyl&lt;/a&gt; radical, are very harmful to cells, as they oxidize proteins and cause &lt;a href=\"mutation\"&gt;mutation&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"DNA\"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;. This cellular damage might contribute to &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; and is proposed as one cause of &lt;a href=\"free-radical%20theory%20of%20aging\"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cytochrome c oxidase complex is highly efficient at reducing oxygen to water, and it releases very few partly reduced intermediates; however small amounts of superoxide anion and peroxide are produced by the electron transport chain. Particularly important is the reduction of &lt;a href=\"coenzyme%20Q\"&gt;coenzyme Q&lt;/a&gt; in complex III, as a highly reactive ubisemiquinone free radical is formed as an intermediate in the Q cycle. This unstable species can lead to electron \"leakage\" when electrons transfer directly to oxygen, forming superoxide. As the production of reactive oxygen species by these proton-pumping complexes is greatest at high membrane potentials, it has been proposed that mitochondria regulate their activity to maintain the membrane potential within a narrow range that balances ATP production against oxidant generation. For instance, oxidants can activate &lt;a href=\"uncoupling%20protein\"&gt;uncoupling protein&lt;/a&gt;s that reduce membrane potential.\nTo counteract these reactive oxygen species, cells contain numerous &lt;a href=\"antioxidant\"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; systems, including antioxidant &lt;a href=\"vitamin\"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20C\"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20E\"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, and antioxidant enzymes such as &lt;a href=\"superoxide%20dismutase\"&gt;superoxide dismutase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"catalase\"&gt;catalase&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"peroxidases\"&gt;peroxidases&lt;/a&gt;, which detoxify the reactive species, limiting damage to the cell.\nOxidative phosphorylation in hypoxic conditions.\nAs &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; is fundamental for oxidative phosphorylation, a shortage in O2 level likely alters ATP production rates. However, proton motive force and ATP production can be maintained by intracellular acidosis. Cytosolic protons that have accumulated with ATP hydrolysis and &lt;a href=\"lactic%20acidosis\"&gt;lactic acidosis&lt;/a&gt; can freely diffuse across the mitochondrial outer-membrane and acidify the inter-membrane space, hence directly contributing to the proton motive force and ATP production.\nInhibitors.\nThere are several well-known &lt;a href=\"drug\"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"toxin\"&gt;toxin&lt;/a&gt;s that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Although any one of these toxins inhibits only one enzyme in the electron transport chain, inhibition of any step in this process will halt the rest of the process. For example, if &lt;a href=\"oligomycin\"&gt;oligomycin&lt;/a&gt; inhibits ATP synthase, protons cannot pass back into the mitochondrion. As a result, the proton pumps are unable to operate, as the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD+ falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use.\nMany site-specific inhibitors of the electron transport chain have contributed to the present knowledge of mitochondrial respiration. Synthesis of ATP is also dependent on the electron transport chain, so all site-specific inhibitors also inhibit ATP formation. The fish poison &lt;a href=\"rotenone\"&gt;rotenone&lt;/a&gt;, the barbiturate drug &lt;a href=\"amobarbital\"&gt;amytal&lt;/a&gt;, and the antibiotic &lt;a href=\"piericidin%20A\"&gt;piericidin A&lt;/a&gt; inhibit NADH and coenzyme Q.\nCarbon monoxide, cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and azide effectively inhibit cytochrome oxidase. Carbon monoxide reacts with the reduced form of the cytochrome while cyanide and azide react with the oxidised form. An antibiotic, &lt;a href=\"antimycin%20A\"&gt;antimycin A&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dimercaprol\"&gt;British anti-Lewisite&lt;/a&gt;, an antidote used against chemical weapons, are the two important inhibitors of the site between cytochrome B and C1.\nNot all inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation are toxins. In &lt;a href=\"brown%20adipose%20tissue\"&gt;brown adipose tissue&lt;/a&gt;, regulated proton channels called &lt;a href=\"uncoupling%20protein\"&gt;uncoupling protein&lt;/a&gt;s can uncouple respiration from ATP synthesis. This rapid respiration produces heat, and is particularly important as a way of maintaining &lt;a href=\"body%20temperature\"&gt;body temperature&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"hibernation\"&gt;hibernating&lt;/a&gt; animals, although these proteins may also have a more general function in cells' responses to stress.\nHistory.\nThe field of oxidative phosphorylation began with the report in 1906 by &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Harden\"&gt;Arthur Harden&lt;/a&gt; of a vital role for phosphate in cellular &lt;a href=\"fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29\"&gt;fermentation&lt;/a&gt;, but initially only &lt;a href=\"sugar%20phosphates\"&gt;sugar phosphates&lt;/a&gt; were known to be involved. However, in the early 1940s, the link between the oxidation of sugars and the generation of ATP was firmly established by &lt;a href=\"Herman%20Kalckar\"&gt;Herman Kalckar&lt;/a&gt;, confirming the central role of ATP in energy transfer that had been proposed by &lt;a href=\"Fritz%20Albert%20Lipmann\"&gt;Fritz Albert Lipmann&lt;/a&gt; in 1941. Later, in 1949, Morris Friedkin and &lt;a href=\"Albert%20L.%20Lehninger\"&gt;Albert L. Lehninger&lt;/a&gt; proved that the coenzyme NADH linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle and the synthesis of ATP. The term \"oxidative phosphorylation\" was coined by in 1939.\nFor another twenty years, the mechanism by which ATP is generated remained mysterious, with scientists searching for an elusive \"high-energy intermediate\" that would link oxidation and phosphorylation reactions. This puzzle was solved by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20D.%20Mitchell\"&gt;Peter D. Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; with the publication of the &lt;a href=\"chemiosmotic%20theory\"&gt;chemiosmotic theory&lt;/a&gt; in 1961. At first, this proposal was highly controversial, but it was slowly accepted and Mitchell was awarded a &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel prize&lt;/a&gt; in 1978. Subsequent research concentrated on purifying and characterizing the enzymes involved, with major contributions being made by &lt;a href=\"David%20E.%20Green\"&gt;David E. Green&lt;/a&gt; on the complexes of the electron-transport chain, as well as &lt;a href=\"Efraim%20Racker\"&gt;Efraim Racker&lt;/a&gt; on the ATP synthase. A critical step towards solving the mechanism of the ATP synthase was provided by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20D.%20Boyer\"&gt;Paul D. Boyer&lt;/a&gt;, by his development in 1973 of the \"binding change\" mechanism, followed by his radical proposal of rotational catalysis in 1982. More recent work has included &lt;a href=\"x-ray%20crystallography\"&gt;structural studies&lt;/a&gt; on the enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation by &lt;a href=\"John%20E.%20Walker\"&gt;John E. Walker&lt;/a&gt;, with Walker and Boyer being awarded a Nobel Prize in 1997."
