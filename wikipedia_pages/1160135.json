    "text": "Jay Marine Cowan (born July 31, 1946-January 23, 2022) was a &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Manitoba\"&gt;Manitoba&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Manitoba\"&gt;Legislative Assembly of Manitoba&lt;/a&gt; from 1977 to 1990, and a &lt;a href=\"Minister%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet minister&lt;/a&gt; in the government of &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Pawley\"&gt;Howard Pawley&lt;/a&gt; from 1981 to 1988.\nCowan left the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; to avoid that nation's military draft. In Canada, he worked as a miner and organizer for the &lt;a href=\"social%20democratic\"&gt;social democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"New%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Manitoba\"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Steelworkers%20of%20America\"&gt;United Steelworkers of America&lt;/a&gt; during this period.\nIn 1977, Cowan was sent by &lt;a href=\"Manitoba%20New%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Manitoba NDP&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Schreyer\"&gt;Edward Schreyer&lt;/a&gt; to the northern &lt;a href=\"electoral%20district%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Churchill%20%28Manitoba%20riding%29\"&gt;Churchill&lt;/a&gt; to scout for suitable candidates. Perhaps contrary to Schreyer's expectations, he secured the nomination for himself (despite the fact that he was not yet a Canadian citizen) and was duly returned in the &lt;a href=\"1977%20Manitoba%20general%20election\"&gt;general election&lt;/a&gt; that followed, defeating &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Manitoba\"&gt;Progressive Conservative&lt;/a&gt; Mark Ingebrigtson by about 300 votes.\nIn 1979, Cowan was one of the most prominent supporters of &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Pawley\"&gt;Howard Pawley&lt;/a&gt; in the latter's successful bid to succeed Schreyer as party leader. Cowan was re-elected in the &lt;a href=\"1981%20Manitoba%20general%20election\"&gt;general election of 1981&lt;/a&gt; (this time defeating Ingebrigtson by around 1350 votes); the NDP won the election, and he was appointed &lt;a href=\"Manitoba%20Minister%20of%20Northern%20Affairs\"&gt;Minister of Northern Affairs&lt;/a&gt; on November 30, 1981, with responsibility for &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Management%20%28Manitoba%20ministry%29\"&gt;Environmental Management&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Clean%20Environment%20Act%20%28Manitoba%20ministry%29\"&gt;Clean Environment Act&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Workers%20Compensation%20Act%20%28Manitoba%20ministry%29\"&gt;Workers Compensation Act&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Workplace%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Act%20%28Manitoba%20ministry%29\"&gt;Workplace Safety and Health Act&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Communities%20Economic%20Development%20Fund%20Act%20%28Manitoba%20ministry%29\"&gt;Communities Economic Development Fund Act&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing a &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; shuffle on November 4, 1983, Cowan was named &lt;a href=\"Manitoba%20Minister%20of%20Co-operative%20Development\"&gt;Minister of Co-operative Development&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manitoba%20Chairman%20of%20the%20Treasury%20Board\"&gt;Chairman of the Treasury Board&lt;/a&gt;. He was again re-elected without difficulty in the &lt;a href=\"1986%20Manitoba%20general%20election\"&gt;general election of 1986&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn April 17, 1986, Cowan was relieved of his position with the Treasury Board and was named government house leader. He continued to serve as Minister of Co-operative Development, and was also the &lt;a href=\"Manitoba%20Minister%20of%20Native%20Affairs\"&gt;Minister of Native Affairs&lt;/a&gt; (without portfolio) responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Natural%20Gas%20Supply%20Act%20%28Manitoba%20ministry%29\"&gt;Natural Gas Supply Act&lt;/a&gt; from September 21, 1987 to November 23, 1987.\nThe NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in 1988, after disgruntled backbencher &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Walding\"&gt;Jim Walding&lt;/a&gt; voted with the opposition in a narrowly divided house. Cowan was one of only twelve New Democrats (in a 57-member house) to be returned in the &lt;a href=\"1988%20Manitoba%20general%20election\"&gt;1988 general election&lt;/a&gt;. In opposition, he opposed the proposed labour reforms of &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Manitoba\"&gt;Progressive Conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Filmon\"&gt;Gary Filmon&lt;/a&gt;. He chose not to seek re-election in 1990.\nCowan was director of special projects at the &lt;a href=\"Anokiiwin%20Training%20Institute\"&gt;Anokiiwin Training Institute&lt;/a&gt;, working with aboriginal groups in Manitoba and northwestern &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. As of 2003, he was also the chair of the &lt;a href=\"Manitoba%20Federation%20of%20Labour\"&gt;Manitoba Federation of Labour&lt;/a&gt;'s health and safety committee."
