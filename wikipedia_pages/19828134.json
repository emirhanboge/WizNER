    "text": "Plants are predominantly &lt;a href=\"photosynthetic\"&gt;photosynthetic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"eukaryote\"&gt;eukaryote&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20%28biology%29\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; Plantae. Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s, and included &lt;a href=\"algae\"&gt;algae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fungi\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the &lt;a href=\"prokaryote\"&gt;prokaryote&lt;/a&gt;s (the &lt;a href=\"archaea\"&gt;archaea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bacteria\"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;). By one definition, plants form the &lt;a href=\"clade\"&gt;clade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Viridiplantae\"&gt;Viridiplantae&lt;/a&gt; (Latin name for \"green plants\"), a group that includes the &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"conifer\"&gt;conifer&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"gymnosperm\"&gt;gymnosperm&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Fern%20ally\"&gt;their allies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hornwort\"&gt;hornwort&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"liverworts\"&gt;liverworts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;es, and the &lt;a href=\"green%20algae\"&gt;green algae&lt;/a&gt;, but excludes the &lt;a href=\"Rhodophyta\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"brown%20algae\"&gt;brown algae&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost plants are &lt;a href=\"multicellular\"&gt;multicellular&lt;/a&gt; organisms. Green plants obtain most of their energy from &lt;a href=\"sunlight\"&gt;sunlight&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"photosynthesis\"&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt; by primary &lt;a href=\"chloroplast\"&gt;chloroplast&lt;/a&gt;s that are derived from &lt;a href=\"endosymbiosis\"&gt;endosymbiosis&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"cyanobacteria\"&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/a&gt;. Their chloroplasts contain &lt;a href=\"chlorophyll\"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt;s a and b, which gives them their green color. Some plants are &lt;a href=\"Parasitic%20plant\"&gt;parasitic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mycotroph\"&gt;mycotroph&lt;/a&gt;ic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds. Plants are characterized by &lt;a href=\"sexual%20reproduction\"&gt;sexual reproduction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"alternation%20of%20generations\"&gt;alternation of generations&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href=\"asexual%20reproduction\"&gt;asexual reproduction&lt;/a&gt; is also common.\nThere are about 320,000 &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of plants, of which the great majority, some 260\u2013290 thousand, &lt;a href=\"Spermatophyte\"&gt;produce seeds&lt;/a&gt;. Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems. Plants that produce &lt;a href=\"grain\"&gt;grain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"vegetable\"&gt;vegetable&lt;/a&gt;s also form basic human foods and have been &lt;a href=\"domesticated\"&gt;domesticated&lt;/a&gt; for millennia. Plants have many &lt;a href=\"Plants%20in%20culture\"&gt;cultural&lt;/a&gt; and other uses, as ornaments, &lt;a href=\"building%20materials\"&gt;building materials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"writing%20material\"&gt;writing material&lt;/a&gt; and, in great variety, they have been the &lt;a href=\"medicinal%20plant\"&gt;source of medicines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"psychoactive%20drug\"&gt;psychoactive drug&lt;/a&gt;s. The scientific study of plants is known as &lt;a href=\"botany\"&gt;botany&lt;/a&gt;, a branch of &lt;a href=\"biology\"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefinition.\nAll living things were traditionally placed into one of two groups, plants and animals. This classification may date from &lt;a href=\"Aristotle\"&gt;Aristotle&lt;/a&gt; (384\u00a0BC \u2013 322\u00a0BC), who made the distinction between plants, which generally do not move, and animals, which often are mobile to catch their food. Much later, when &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; (1707\u20131778) created the basis of the modern system of &lt;a href=\"scientific%20classification\"&gt;scientific classification&lt;/a&gt;, these two groups became the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20%28biology%29\"&gt;kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; Vegetabilia (later Metaphyta or Plantae) and &lt;a href=\"Animalia\"&gt;Animalia&lt;/a&gt; (also called Metazoa). Since then, it has become clear that the plant kingdom as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; and several groups of &lt;a href=\"algae\"&gt;algae&lt;/a&gt; were removed to new kingdoms. However, these organisms are still often considered plants, particularly in informal contexts.\nThe term \"plant\" generally implies the possession of the following traits: multicellularity, possession of cell walls containing &lt;a href=\"cellulose\"&gt;cellulose&lt;/a&gt;, and the ability to carry out photosynthesis with primary chloroplasts.\nCurrent definitions of Plantae.\nWhen the name Plantae or plant is applied to a specific group of organisms or &lt;a href=\"taxon\"&gt;taxon&lt;/a&gt;, it usually refers to one of four concepts. From least to most inclusive, these four groupings are:\nAnother way of looking at the relationships between the different groups that have been called \"plants\" is through a &lt;a href=\"cladogram\"&gt;cladogram&lt;/a&gt;, which shows their evolutionary relationships. These are not yet completely settled, but . Those which have been called \"plants\" are in bold (some minor groups have been omitted).\nThe way in which the groups of green algae are combined and named varies considerably between authors.\nAlgae.\nAlgae consist of several groups of organisms which produce food by photosynthesis and thus have traditionally been included in the plant kingdom. The &lt;a href=\"seaweed\"&gt;seaweed&lt;/a&gt;s range from large multicellular algae to single-celled organisms and are classified into three groups, the &lt;a href=\"green%20algae\"&gt;green algae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20algae\"&gt;red algae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"brown%20algae\"&gt;brown algae&lt;/a&gt;. There is good evidence that the brown algae evolved independently from the others, from non-photosynthetic ancestors that formed endosymbiotic relationships with red algae rather than from cyanobacteria, and they are no longer classified as plants as defined here.\nThe Viridiplantae, the green plants \u2013 green algae and land plants \u2013 form a &lt;a href=\"clade\"&gt;clade&lt;/a&gt;, a group consisting of all the descendants of a common ancestor. With a few exceptions, the green plants have the following features in common; primary &lt;a href=\"chloroplast\"&gt;chloroplast&lt;/a&gt;s derived from cyanobacteria containing &lt;a href=\"chlorophyll\"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt;s \"a\" and \"b\", cell walls containing &lt;a href=\"cellulose\"&gt;cellulose&lt;/a&gt;, and food stores in the form of &lt;a href=\"starch\"&gt;starch&lt;/a&gt; contained within the plastids. They undergo closed &lt;a href=\"mitosis\"&gt;mitosis&lt;/a&gt; without &lt;a href=\"centriole\"&gt;centriole&lt;/a&gt;s, and typically have &lt;a href=\"mitochondrion\"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; with flat cristae. The &lt;a href=\"chloroplast\"&gt;chloroplast&lt;/a&gt;s of green plants are surrounded by two membranes, suggesting they originated directly from endosymbiotic &lt;a href=\"cyanobacteria\"&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo additional groups, the &lt;a href=\"Rhodophyta\"&gt;Rhodophyta&lt;/a&gt; (red algae) and &lt;a href=\"Glaucophyta\"&gt;Glaucophyta&lt;/a&gt; (glaucophyte algae), also have primary chloroplasts that appear to be derived directly from endosymbiotic &lt;a href=\"cyanobacteria\"&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/a&gt;, although they differ from Viridiplantae in the pigments which are used in photosynthesis and so are different in colour. These groups also differ from green plants in that the storage polysaccharide is &lt;a href=\"floridean%20starch\"&gt;floridean starch&lt;/a&gt; and is stored in the cytoplasm rather than in the plastids. They appear to have had a common origin with Viridiplantae and the three groups form the clade &lt;a href=\"Archaeplastida\"&gt;Archaeplastida&lt;/a&gt;, whose name implies that their chloroplasts were derived from a single ancient endosymbiotic event. This is the broadest modern definition of the term 'plant'.\nIn contrast, most other algae (e.g. &lt;a href=\"heterokont\"&gt;brown algae/diatoms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"haptophyte\"&gt;haptophyte&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dinoflagellate\"&gt;dinoflagellate&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"euglenid\"&gt;euglenid&lt;/a&gt;s) not only have different pigments but also have chloroplasts with three or four surrounding membranes. They are not close relatives of the Archaeplastida, presumably having acquired chloroplasts separately from ingested or symbiotic green and red algae. They are thus not included in even the broadest modern definition of the plant kingdom, although they were in the past.\nThe green plants or Viridiplantae were traditionally divided into the green algae (including the stoneworts) and the land plants. However, it is now known that the land plants evolved from within a group of green algae, so that the green algae by themselves are a &lt;a href=\"paraphyly\"&gt;paraphyletic&lt;/a&gt; group, i.e. a group that excludes some of the descendants of a common ancestor. Paraphyletic groups are generally avoided in modern classifications, so that in recent treatments the Viridiplantae have been divided into two clades, the &lt;a href=\"Chlorophyta\"&gt;Chlorophyta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Streptophyta\"&gt;Streptophyta&lt;/a&gt; (including the land plants and Charophyta).\nThe Chlorophyta (a name that has also been used for \"all\" green algae) are the sister group to the Charophytes, from which the land plants evolved. There are about 4,300 species, mainly unicellular or multicellular marine organisms such as the sea lettuce, \"&lt;a href=\"Ulva%20%28genus%29\"&gt;Ulva&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe other group within the Viridiplantae are the mainly freshwater or terrestrial Streptophyta, which consists of the land plants together with the Charophyta, itself consisting of several groups of green algae such as the &lt;a href=\"desmid\"&gt;desmid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Charales\"&gt;stoneworts&lt;/a&gt;. Streptophyte algae are either unicellular or form multicellular filaments, branched or unbranched. The genus \"&lt;a href=\"Spirogyra\"&gt;Spirogyra&lt;/a&gt;\" is a filamentous streptophyte alga familiar to many, as it is often used in teaching and is one of the organisms responsible for the algal \"scum\" on ponds. The freshwater stoneworts strongly resemble land plants and are believed to be their closest relatives. Growing immersed in fresh water, they consist of a central stalk with whorls of branchlets.\nFungi.\n&lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Linnaeus'&lt;/a&gt; original classification placed the fungi within the Plantae, since they were unquestionably neither animals or minerals and these were the only other alternatives. With 19th century developments in &lt;a href=\"microbiology\"&gt;microbiology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Haeckel\"&gt;Ernst Haeckel&lt;/a&gt; introduced the new kingdom Protista in addition to Plantae and Animalia, but whether fungi were best placed in the Plantae or should be reclassified as protists remained controversial. In 1969, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Whittaker%20%28ecologist%29\"&gt;Robert Whittaker&lt;/a&gt; proposed the creation of the kingdom Fungi. Molecular evidence has since shown that the &lt;a href=\"most%20recent%20common%20ancestor\"&gt;most recent common ancestor&lt;/a&gt; (concestor), of the Fungi was probably more similar to that of the Animalia than to that of Plantae or any other kingdom.\nWhittaker's original reclassification was based on the fundamental difference in nutrition between the Fungi and the Plantae. Unlike plants, which generally gain carbon through photosynthesis, and so are called &lt;a href=\"autotroph\"&gt;autotroph&lt;/a&gt;s, fungi do not possess chloroplasts and generally obtain carbon by breaking down and absorbing surrounding materials, and so are called &lt;a href=\"heterotroph\"&gt;heterotroph&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"saprotrophs\"&gt;saprotrophs&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the substructure of multicellular fungi is different from that of plants, taking the form of many chitinous microscopic strands called &lt;a href=\"hypha\"&gt;hypha&lt;/a&gt;e, which may be further subdivided into cells or may form a &lt;a href=\"syncytium\"&gt;syncytium&lt;/a&gt; containing many &lt;a href=\"eukaryotic\"&gt;eukaryotic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cell%20nucleus\"&gt;nuclei&lt;/a&gt;. Fruiting bodies, of which &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s are the most familiar example, are the reproductive structures of fungi, and are unlike any structures produced by plants.\nDiversity.\nThe table below shows some species count estimates of different green plant (Viridiplantae) divisions. About 85\u201390% of all plants are flowering plants. Several projects are currently attempting to collect all plant species in online databases, e.g. the &lt;a href=\"World%20Flora%20Online\"&gt;World Flora Online&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20Plants\"&gt;World Plants&lt;/a&gt; both list about 350,000 species.\nThe naming of plants is governed by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20for%20algae%2C%20fungi%2C%20and%20plants\"&gt;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20for%20Cultivated%20Plants\"&gt;International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"cultivated%20plant%20taxonomy\"&gt;cultivated plant taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;).\nEvolution.\nThe evolution of plants has resulted in increasing &lt;a href=\"Evolutionary%20grade\"&gt;levels of complexity&lt;/a&gt;, from the earliest &lt;a href=\"algal%20mat\"&gt;algal mat&lt;/a&gt;s, through &lt;a href=\"bryophyte\"&gt;bryophyte&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lycopod\"&gt;lycopod&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;s to the complex &lt;a href=\"gymnosperm\"&gt;gymnosperm&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"angiosperm\"&gt;angiosperm&lt;/a&gt;s of today. Plants in all of these groups continue to thrive, especially in the environments in which they evolved.\nAn algal scum formed on the land , but it was not until the &lt;a href=\"Ordovician%20Period\"&gt;Ordovician Period&lt;/a&gt;, around , that land plants appeared. However, new evidence from the study of carbon isotope ratios in Precambrian rocks has suggested that complex photosynthetic plants developed on the earth over 1000\u00a0m.y.a. For more than a century it has been assumed that the ancestors of land plants evolved in aquatic environments and then adapted to a life on land, an idea usually credited to botanist &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Orpen%20Bower\"&gt;Frederick Orpen Bower&lt;/a&gt; in his 1908 book \"The Origin of a Land Flora\". A recent alternative view, supported by genetic evidence, is that they evolved from terrestrial single-celled algae, and that even the common ancestor of red and green algae, and the unicellular freshwater algae &lt;a href=\"glaucophyte\"&gt;glaucophyte&lt;/a&gt;s, originated in a terrestrial environment in freshwater biofilms or microbial mats. Primitive land plants began to diversify in the late &lt;a href=\"Silurian%20Period\"&gt;Silurian Period&lt;/a&gt;, around , and the results of their diversification are displayed in remarkable detail in an early &lt;a href=\"Devonian\"&gt;Devonian&lt;/a&gt; fossil assemblage from the &lt;a href=\"Rhynie%20chert\"&gt;Rhynie chert&lt;/a&gt;. This chert preserved early plants in cellular detail, petrified in volcanic springs. By the middle of the Devonian Period most of the features recognised in plants today are present, including roots, leaves and secondary wood, and by late Devonian times seeds had evolved. Late Devonian plants had thereby reached a degree of sophistication that allowed them to form forests of tall trees. Evolutionary innovation continued in the Carboniferous and later geological periods and is ongoing today. Most plant groups were relatively unscathed by the &lt;a href=\"Permo-Triassic%20extinction%20event\"&gt;Permo-Triassic extinction event&lt;/a&gt;, although the structures of communities changed. This may have set the scene for the evolution of flowering plants in the Triassic (~), which exploded in the Cretaceous and Tertiary. The latest major group of plants to evolve were the grasses, which became important in the mid Tertiary, from around . The grasses, as well as many other groups, evolved new mechanisms of metabolism to survive the low and warm, dry conditions of the tropics over the last .\nA 1997 proposed &lt;a href=\"phylogenetic%20tree\"&gt;phylogenetic tree&lt;/a&gt; of Plantae, after Kenrick and Crane, is as follows, with modification to the Pteridophyta from Smith \"et al.\" The &lt;a href=\"Prasinophyceae\"&gt;Prasinophyceae&lt;/a&gt; are a &lt;a href=\"paraphyletic\"&gt;paraphyletic&lt;/a&gt; assemblage of early diverging green algal lineages, but are treated as a group outside the Chlorophyta: later authors have not followed this suggestion.\nA newer proposed classification follows Leliaert et al. 2011 and modified with Silar 2016 for the green algae clades and Nov\u00edkov &amp; Baraba\u0161-Krasni 2015 for the land plants clade. Notice that the Prasinophyceae are here placed inside the Chlorophyta.\nLater, a phylogeny based on genomes and transcriptomes from 1,153 plant species was proposed. The placing of algal groups is supported by phylogenies based on genomes from the Mesostigmatophyceae and Chlorokybophyceae that have since been sequenced. The classification of Bryophyta is supported both by Puttick \"et al.\" 2018, and by phylogenies involving the hornwort genomes that have also since been sequenced.\nEmbryophytes.\nThe plants that are likely most familiar to us are the &lt;a href=\"multicellular\"&gt;multicellular&lt;/a&gt; land plants, called &lt;a href=\"embryophyte\"&gt;embryophyte&lt;/a&gt;s. Embryophytes include the &lt;a href=\"vascular%20plant\"&gt;vascular plant&lt;/a&gt;s, such as ferns, conifers and flowering plants. They also include the \"&lt;a href=\"bryophyte\"&gt;bryophyte&lt;/a&gt;s\", of which &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"Marchantiophyta\"&gt;liverworts&lt;/a&gt; are the most common.\nAll of these plants have &lt;a href=\"eukaryote\"&gt;eukaryotic&lt;/a&gt; cells with &lt;a href=\"cell%20wall\"&gt;cell wall&lt;/a&gt;s composed of &lt;a href=\"cellulose\"&gt;cellulose&lt;/a&gt;, and most obtain their energy through &lt;a href=\"photosynthesis\"&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, water and &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; to synthesize food. About three hundred plant species do not photosynthesize but are &lt;a href=\"parasite\"&gt;parasite&lt;/a&gt;s on other species of photosynthetic plants. Embryophytes are distinguished from &lt;a href=\"green%20algae\"&gt;green algae&lt;/a&gt;, which represent a mode of photosynthetic life similar to the kind modern plants are believed to have evolved from, by having specialized reproductive organs protected by non-reproductive tissues.\nBryophytes first appeared during the early &lt;a href=\"Paleozoic\"&gt;Paleozoic&lt;/a&gt;. They mainly live in habitats where moisture is available for significant periods, although some species, such as &lt;a href=\"Targionia%20%28plant%29\"&gt;\"Targionia\"&lt;/a&gt;, are desiccation-tolerant. Most species of bryophytes remain small throughout their life-cycle. This involves an alternation between two generations: a &lt;a href=\"haploid\"&gt;haploid&lt;/a&gt; stage, called the &lt;a href=\"gametophyte\"&gt;gametophyte&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"diploid\"&gt;diploid&lt;/a&gt; stage, called the &lt;a href=\"sporophyte\"&gt;sporophyte&lt;/a&gt;. In bryophytes, the sporophyte is always unbranched and remains nutritionally dependent on its parent gametophyte. The embryophytes have the ability to secrete a &lt;a href=\"Plant%20cuticle\"&gt;cuticle&lt;/a&gt; on their outer surface, a waxy layer that confers resistance to desiccation. In the &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"hornwort\"&gt;hornwort&lt;/a&gt;s a cuticle is usually only produced on the sporophyte. &lt;a href=\"Stomata\"&gt;Stomata&lt;/a&gt; are absent from liverworts, but occur on the sporangia of mosses and hornworts, allowing gas exchange.\nVascular plants first appeared during the &lt;a href=\"Silurian\"&gt;Silurian&lt;/a&gt; period, and by the &lt;a href=\"Devonian\"&gt;Devonian&lt;/a&gt; had diversified and spread into many different terrestrial environments. They developed a number of adaptations that allowed them to spread into increasingly more arid places, notably the vascular tissues &lt;a href=\"xylem\"&gt;xylem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"phloem\"&gt;phloem&lt;/a&gt;, that transport water and food throughout the organism. Root systems capable of obtaining soil water and nutrients also evolved during the Devonian. In modern vascular plants, the sporophyte is typically large, branched, nutritionally independent and long-lived, but there is increasing evidence that Paleozoic gametophytes were just as complex as the sporophytes. The gametophytes of all vascular plant groups evolved to become reduced in size and prominence in the life cycle.\nIn seed plants, the &lt;a href=\"gametophyte%23Heteromorphy\"&gt;microgametophyte&lt;/a&gt; is reduced from a multicellular free-living organism to a few cells in a pollen grain and the miniaturised &lt;a href=\"gametophyte%23Heteromorphy\"&gt;megagametophyte&lt;/a&gt; remains inside the megasporangium, attached to and dependent on the parent plant. A megasporangium enclosed in a protective layer called an integument is known as an &lt;a href=\"ovule\"&gt;ovule&lt;/a&gt;. After fertilisation by means of sperm produced by &lt;a href=\"pollen\"&gt;pollen&lt;/a&gt; grains, an embryo sporophyte develops inside the ovule. The integument becomes a seed coat, and the ovule develops into a seed. Seed plants can survive and reproduce in extremely arid conditions, because they are not dependent on free water for the movement of sperm, or the development of free living gametophytes.\nThe first seed plants, &lt;a href=\"Pteridospermatophyta\"&gt;pteridosperms&lt;/a&gt; (seed ferns), now extinct, appeared in the Devonian and diversified through the Carboniferous. They were the ancestors of modern &lt;a href=\"gymnosperm\"&gt;gymnosperm&lt;/a&gt;s, of which four surviving groups are widespread today, particularly the &lt;a href=\"conifer\"&gt;conifer&lt;/a&gt;s, which are dominant &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s in several &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. The name gymnosperm comes from the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; , a composite of ( ) and ( ), as the ovules and subsequent seeds are not enclosed in a protective structure (carpels or fruit), but are borne naked, typically on cone scales.\nFossils.\nPlant &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s include roots, wood, leaves, seeds, fruit, &lt;a href=\"pollen\"&gt;pollen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spore\"&gt;spore&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"phytolith\"&gt;phytolith&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"amber\"&gt;amber&lt;/a&gt; (the fossilized resin produced by some plants). Fossil land plants are recorded in terrestrial, lacustrine, fluvial and nearshore marine sediments. &lt;a href=\"Pollen\"&gt;Pollen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spores\"&gt;spores&lt;/a&gt; and algae (&lt;a href=\"dinoflagellate\"&gt;dinoflagellate&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"acritarch\"&gt;acritarch&lt;/a&gt;s) are used for dating sedimentary rock sequences. The remains of fossil plants are not as common as fossil animals, although plant fossils are locally abundant in many regions worldwide.\nThe earliest fossils clearly assignable to Kingdom Plantae are fossil green algae from the &lt;a href=\"Cambrian\"&gt;Cambrian&lt;/a&gt;. These fossils resemble &lt;a href=\"Calcification\"&gt;calcified&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"multicellular\"&gt;multicellular&lt;/a&gt; members of the &lt;a href=\"Dasycladales\"&gt;Dasycladales&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier &lt;a href=\"Precambrian\"&gt;Precambrian&lt;/a&gt; fossils are known that resemble single-cell green algae, but definitive identity with that group of algae is uncertain.\nThe earliest fossils attributed to green algae date from the &lt;a href=\"Precambrian\"&gt;Precambrian&lt;/a&gt; (ca. 1200 mya). The resistant outer walls of &lt;a href=\"Prasinophyceae\"&gt;prasinophyte&lt;/a&gt; cysts (known as phycomata) are well preserved in fossil deposits of the &lt;a href=\"Paleozoic\"&gt;Paleozoic&lt;/a&gt; (ca. 250\u2013540 mya). A filamentous fossil (\"Proterocladus\") from middle Neoproterozoic deposits (ca. 750 mya) has been attributed to the &lt;a href=\"Cladophorales\"&gt;Cladophorales&lt;/a&gt;, while the oldest reliable records of the &lt;a href=\"Bryopsidales\"&gt;Bryopsidales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dasycladales\"&gt;Dasycladales&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Charales\"&gt;stoneworts&lt;/a&gt; are from the &lt;a href=\"Paleozoic\"&gt;Paleozoic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe oldest known fossils of embryophytes date from the &lt;a href=\"Ordovician\"&gt;Ordovician&lt;/a&gt;, though such fossils are fragmentary. By the &lt;a href=\"Silurian\"&gt;Silurian&lt;/a&gt;, fossils of whole plants are preserved, including the simple vascular plant \"&lt;a href=\"Cooksonia\"&gt;Cooksonia&lt;/a&gt;\" in mid-Silurian and the much larger and more complex &lt;a href=\"lycophyte\"&gt;lycophyte&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Baragwanathia%20longifolia\"&gt;Baragwanathia longifolia&lt;/a&gt;\" in late Silurian. From the early Devonian &lt;a href=\"Rhynie%20chert\"&gt;Rhynie chert&lt;/a&gt;, detailed fossils of lycophytes and &lt;a href=\"rhyniophyte\"&gt;rhyniophyte&lt;/a&gt;s have been found that show details of the individual cells within the plant organs and the symbiotic association of these plants with fungi of the order &lt;a href=\"Glomerales\"&gt;Glomales&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Devonian%20period\"&gt;Devonian period&lt;/a&gt; also saw the evolution of leaves and roots, and the first modern tree, \"&lt;a href=\"Archaeopteris\"&gt;Archaeopteris&lt;/a&gt;\". This tree with fern-like foliage and a trunk with conifer-like wood was &lt;a href=\"heterosporous\"&gt;heterosporous&lt;/a&gt; producing spores of two different sizes, an early step in the evolution of seeds.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Coal%20measure\"&gt;Coal measure&lt;/a&gt;s are a major source of &lt;a href=\"Paleozoic\"&gt;Paleozoic&lt;/a&gt; plant fossils, with many groups of plants in existence at this time. The spoil heaps of coal mines are the best places to collect; &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; itself is the remains of fossilised plants, though structural detail of the plant fossils is rarely visible in coal. In the &lt;a href=\"Fossil%20Grove\"&gt;Fossil Grove&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Park%2C%20Glasgow\"&gt;Victoria Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland, the stumps of \"&lt;a href=\"Lepidodendron\"&gt;Lepidodendron&lt;/a&gt;\" trees are found in their original growth positions.\nThe fossilized remains of &lt;a href=\"conifer\"&gt;conifer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"angiosperm\"&gt;angiosperm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"plant%20stem\"&gt;stems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"branch\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt;es may be locally abundant in lake and inshore &lt;a href=\"sedimentary%20rock\"&gt;sedimentary rock&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Mesozoic\"&gt;Mesozoic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cenozoic\"&gt;Cenozoic&lt;/a&gt; eras. &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Redwood\"&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt; and its allies, &lt;a href=\"magnolia\"&gt;magnolia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arecaceae\"&gt;palms&lt;/a&gt; are often found.\n&lt;a href=\"Petrified%20wood\"&gt;Petrified wood&lt;/a&gt; is common in some parts of the world, and is most frequently found in arid or desert areas where it is more readily exposed by &lt;a href=\"erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt;. Petrified wood is often heavily &lt;a href=\"silicified\"&gt;silicified&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"organic%20material\"&gt;organic material&lt;/a&gt; replaced by &lt;a href=\"silicon%20dioxide\"&gt;silicon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;), and the impregnated tissue is often preserved in fine detail. Such specimens may be cut and polished using &lt;a href=\"lapidary\"&gt;lapidary&lt;/a&gt; equipment. Fossil forests of petrified wood have been found in all continents.\nFossils of seed ferns such as \"&lt;a href=\"Glossopteris\"&gt;Glossopteris&lt;/a&gt;\" are widely distributed throughout several continents of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Hemisphere\"&gt;Southern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;, a fact that gave support to &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Wegener\"&gt;Alfred Wegener&lt;/a&gt;'s early ideas regarding &lt;a href=\"Continental%20drift\"&gt;Continental drift&lt;/a&gt; theory.\nStructure, growth, and development.\nMost of the solid material in a plant is taken from the atmosphere. Through the process of &lt;a href=\"photosynthesis\"&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt;, most plants use the energy in &lt;a href=\"sunlight\"&gt;sunlight&lt;/a&gt; to convert &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; from the atmosphere, plus &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, into simple &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;s. These sugars are then used as building blocks and form the main structural component of the plant. &lt;a href=\"Chlorophyll\"&gt;Chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt;, a green-colored, &lt;a href=\"magnesium\"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;-containing &lt;a href=\"pigment\"&gt;pigment&lt;/a&gt; is essential to this process; it is generally present in plant &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;, and often in other plant parts as well. &lt;a href=\"Parasitic%20plant\"&gt;Parasitic plant&lt;/a&gt;s, on the other hand, use the resources of their host to provide the materials needed for metabolism and growth.\nPlants usually rely on soil primarily for support and water (in quantitative terms), but they also obtain &lt;a href=\"chemical%20compound\"&gt;compounds&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"phosphorus\"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potassium\"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, magnesium and other elemental &lt;a href=\"nutrient\"&gt;nutrient&lt;/a&gt;s from the soil. &lt;a href=\"Epiphyte\"&gt;Epiphytic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lithophyte\"&gt;lithophytic&lt;/a&gt; plants depend on air and nearby debris for nutrients, and &lt;a href=\"carnivorous%20plant\"&gt;carnivorous plant&lt;/a&gt;s supplement their nutrient requirements, particularly for nitrogen and phosphorus, with insect prey that they capture. For the majority of plants to grow successfully they also require &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; in the atmosphere and around their roots (&lt;a href=\"soil%20gas\"&gt;soil gas&lt;/a&gt;) for &lt;a href=\"Cellular%20respiration\"&gt;respiration&lt;/a&gt;. Plants use oxygen and &lt;a href=\"glucose\"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; (which may be produced from stored &lt;a href=\"starch\"&gt;starch&lt;/a&gt;) to provide energy. Some plants grow as submerged aquatics, using oxygen dissolved in the surrounding water, and a few specialized vascular plants, such as &lt;a href=\"mangrove\"&gt;mangrove&lt;/a&gt;s and reed (\"&lt;a href=\"Phragmites%20australis\"&gt;Phragmites australis&lt;/a&gt;\"), can grow with their roots in &lt;a href=\"anoxic%20waters\"&gt;anoxic&lt;/a&gt; conditions.\nFactors affecting growth.\nThe genome of a plant controls its growth. For example, selected varieties or genotypes of wheat grow rapidly, maturing within 110 days, whereas others, in the same environmental conditions, grow more slowly and mature within 155 days.\nGrowth is also determined by environmental factors, such as &lt;a href=\"temperature\"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt;, available &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, available &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; and available &lt;a href=\"nutrient\"&gt;nutrient&lt;/a&gt;s in the soil. Any change in the availability of these external conditions will be reflected in the plant's growth and the timing of its development.\nBiotic factors also affect plant growth. Plants can be so crowded that no single individual produces normal growth, causing &lt;a href=\"etiolation\"&gt;etiolation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chlorosis\"&gt;chlorosis&lt;/a&gt;. Optimal plant growth can be hampered by grazing animals, suboptimal soil composition, lack of &lt;a href=\"mycorrhiza\"&gt;mycorrhiza&lt;/a&gt;l fungi, and attacks by insects or &lt;a href=\"plant%20pathology\"&gt;plant diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including those caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, and nematodes.\nSimple plants like algae may have short life spans as individuals, but their populations are commonly seasonal. &lt;a href=\"Annual%20plant\"&gt;Annual plant&lt;/a&gt;s grow and reproduce within one &lt;a href=\"growing%20season\"&gt;growing season&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"biennial%20plant\"&gt;biennial plant&lt;/a&gt;s grow for two growing seasons and usually reproduce in second year, and &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial plant&lt;/a&gt;s live for many growing seasons and once mature will often reproduce annually. These designations often depend on climate and other environmental factors. Plants that are annual in &lt;a href=\"alpine%20climate\"&gt;alpine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"temperate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; regions can be biennial or perennial in warmer climates. Among the vascular plants, perennials include both &lt;a href=\"evergreen\"&gt;evergreen&lt;/a&gt;s that keep their leaves the entire year, and &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt; plants that lose their leaves for some part of it. In temperate and &lt;a href=\"boreal%20climate\"&gt;boreal climate&lt;/a&gt;s, they generally lose their leaves during the winter; many &lt;a href=\"tropical\"&gt;tropical&lt;/a&gt; plants lose their leaves during the &lt;a href=\"dry%20season\"&gt;dry season&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe growth rate of plants is extremely variable. Some mosses grow less than 0.001\u00a0millimeters per hour (mm/h), while most trees grow 0.025\u20130.250\u00a0mm/h. Some climbing species, such as &lt;a href=\"kudzu\"&gt;kudzu&lt;/a&gt;, which do not need to produce thick supportive tissue, may grow up to 12.5\u00a0mm/h.\nPlants protect themselves from &lt;a href=\"frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dehydration\"&gt;dehydration&lt;/a&gt; stress with &lt;a href=\"antifreeze%20protein\"&gt;antifreeze protein&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Heat%20shock%20protein\"&gt;heat-shock proteins&lt;/a&gt; and sugars (&lt;a href=\"sucrose\"&gt;sucrose&lt;/a&gt; is common). LEA (&lt;a href=\"Late%20Embryogenesis%20Abundant%20proteins\"&gt;Late Embryogenesis Abundant&lt;/a&gt;) protein expression is induced by stresses and protects other proteins from aggregation as a result of &lt;a href=\"desiccation\"&gt;desiccation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"freezing\"&gt;freezing&lt;/a&gt;.\nEffects of freezing.\nWhen water freezes in plants, the consequences for the plant depend very much on whether the freezing occurs within cells (intracellularly) or outside cells in intercellular spaces. Intracellular freezing, which usually kills the cell regardless of the hardiness of the plant and its tissues, seldom occurs in nature because rates of cooling are rarely high enough to support it. Rates of cooling of several degrees Celsius per minute are typically needed to cause intracellular formation of ice. At rates of cooling of a few degrees Celsius per hour, segregation of ice occurs in intercellular spaces. This may or may not be lethal, depending on the hardiness of the tissue. At freezing temperatures, water in the intercellular spaces of plant tissue freezes first, though the water may remain unfrozen until temperatures drop below . After the initial formation of intercellular ice, the cells shrink as water is lost to the segregated ice, and the cells undergo freeze-drying. This dehydration is now considered the fundamental cause of freezing injury.\nDNA damage and repair.\nPlants are continuously exposed to a range of biotic and abiotic stresses. These stresses often cause &lt;a href=\"DNA%20damage%20%28naturally%20occurring%29\"&gt;DNA damage&lt;/a&gt; directly, or indirectly via the generation of &lt;a href=\"reactive%20oxygen%20species\"&gt;reactive oxygen species&lt;/a&gt;. Plants are capable of a DNA damage response that is a critical mechanism for maintaining genome stability. The DNA damage response is particularly important during &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"germination\"&gt;germination&lt;/a&gt;, since seed quality tends to deteriorate with age in association with DNA damage accumulation. During germination repair processes are activated to deal with this accumulated DNA damage. In particular, single- and double-strand breaks in DNA can be &lt;a href=\"DNA%20repair\"&gt;repaired&lt;/a&gt;. The DNA checkpoint kinase &lt;a href=\"ATM%20serine/threonine%20kinase\"&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt; has a key role in integrating progression through germination with repair responses to the DNA damages accumulated by the aged seed.\nPlant cells.\nPlant cells are typically distinguished by their large water-filled central &lt;a href=\"vacuole\"&gt;vacuole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chloroplast\"&gt;chloroplast&lt;/a&gt;s, and rigid &lt;a href=\"cell%20wall\"&gt;cell wall&lt;/a&gt;s that are made up of &lt;a href=\"cellulose\"&gt;cellulose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hemicellulose\"&gt;hemicellulose&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pectin\"&gt;pectin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cell%20division\"&gt;Cell division&lt;/a&gt; is also characterized by the development of a &lt;a href=\"phragmoplast\"&gt;phragmoplast&lt;/a&gt; for the construction of a &lt;a href=\"cell%20plate\"&gt;cell plate&lt;/a&gt; in the late stages of &lt;a href=\"cytokinesis\"&gt;cytokinesis&lt;/a&gt;. Just as in animals, plant cells differentiate and develop into multiple cell types. &lt;a href=\"Totipotent\"&gt;Totipotent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"meristem\"&gt;meristem&lt;/a&gt;atic cells can differentiate into &lt;a href=\"vascular%20tissue\"&gt;vascular&lt;/a&gt;, storage, protective (e.g. &lt;a href=\"epidermis%20%28botany%29\"&gt;epidermal layer&lt;/a&gt;), or &lt;a href=\"plant%20sexuality\"&gt;reproductive&lt;/a&gt; tissues, with more primitive plants lacking some tissue types.\nPhysiology.\nPhotosynthesis.\nPlants &lt;a href=\"photosynthesis\"&gt;photosynthesize&lt;/a&gt;, which means that they manufacture their own food molecules using energy obtained from &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;. The primary mechanism plants have for capturing light energy is the &lt;a href=\"pigment\"&gt;pigment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chlorophyll\"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt;. All green plants contain two forms of chlorophyll, &lt;a href=\"chlorophyll%20a\"&gt;chlorophyll \"a\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chlorophyll%20b\"&gt;chlorophyll \"b\"&lt;/a&gt;. The latter of these pigments is not found in red or brown algae.\nThe simple equation of photosynthesis is as follows:\nImmune system.\nBy means of cells that behave like nerves, plants receive and distribute within their systems information about incident light intensity and quality. Incident light that stimulates a chemical reaction in one leaf, will cause a chain reaction of signals to the entire plant via a type of cell termed a \"bundle sheath cell\". Researchers, from the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20University%20of%20Life%20Sciences\"&gt;Warsaw University of Life Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in Poland, found that plants have a specific memory for varying light conditions, which prepares their immune systems against seasonal pathogens. Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures were identified in rice (XA21, 1995) and in \"&lt;a href=\"Arabidopsis%20thaliana\"&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/a&gt;\" (FLS2, 2000). Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors. These include the NBS-LRR class of proteins.\nInternal distribution.\n&lt;a href=\"Vascular%20plant\"&gt;Vascular plant&lt;/a&gt;s differ from other plants in that nutrients are transported between their different parts through specialized structures, called &lt;a href=\"xylem\"&gt;xylem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"phloem\"&gt;phloem&lt;/a&gt;. They also have &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;s for taking up water and minerals. The xylem moves water and minerals from the root to the rest of the plant, and the phloem provides the roots with sugars and other nutrient produced by the leaves.\nGenomics.\nPlants have some of the largest &lt;a href=\"genome\"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt;s among all organisms. The largest plant genome (in terms of gene number) is that of &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; (\"Triticum asestivum\"), predicted to encode \u224894,000 genes and thus almost 5 times as many as the &lt;a href=\"human%20genome\"&gt;human genome&lt;/a&gt;. The first plant genome sequenced was that of \"&lt;a href=\"Arabidopsis%20thaliana\"&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/a&gt;\" which encodes about 25,500 genes. In terms of sheer DNA sequence, the smallest published genome is that of the carnivorous &lt;a href=\"Utricularia%20gibba\"&gt;bladderwort&lt;/a&gt; (\"Utricularia gibba)\" at 82 Mb (although it still encodes 28,500 genes) while the largest, from the &lt;a href=\"Picea%20abies\"&gt;Norway Spruce&lt;/a&gt; (\"Picea abies\"), extends over 19,600 Mb (encoding about 28,300 genes).\nEcology.\nThe photosynthesis conducted by land plants and algae is the ultimate source of energy and organic material in nearly all ecosystems. Photosynthesis, at first by cyanobacteria and later by photosynthetic eukaryotes, radically changed the composition of the early Earth's anoxic atmosphere, which as a result is now 21% &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt;. Animals and most other organisms are &lt;a href=\"Aerobic%20organism\"&gt;aerobic&lt;/a&gt;, relying on oxygen; those that do not are confined to relatively rare &lt;a href=\"anaerobic%20environment\"&gt;anaerobic environment&lt;/a&gt;s. Plants are the &lt;a href=\"Autotroph\"&gt;primary producers&lt;/a&gt; in most terrestrial ecosystems and form the basis of the &lt;a href=\"food%20web\"&gt;food web&lt;/a&gt; in those ecosystems. Many animals rely on plants for shelter as well as oxygen and food. Plants form about 80% of the world &lt;a href=\"Biomass%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;biomass&lt;/a&gt; at about of carbon.\nLand plants are key components of the &lt;a href=\"water%20cycle\"&gt;water cycle&lt;/a&gt; and several other &lt;a href=\"biogeochemical%20cycle\"&gt;biogeochemical cycle&lt;/a&gt;s. Some plants have &lt;a href=\"coevolve\"&gt;coevolve&lt;/a&gt;d with &lt;a href=\"nitrogen%20fixation\"&gt;nitrogen fixing&lt;/a&gt; bacteria, making plants an important part of the &lt;a href=\"nitrogen%20cycle\"&gt;nitrogen cycle&lt;/a&gt;. Plant roots play an essential role in &lt;a href=\"soil\"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt; development and the prevention of &lt;a href=\"soil%20erosion\"&gt;soil erosion&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistribution.\nPlants are distributed almost worldwide. While they inhabit a multitude of &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ecoregion\"&gt;ecoregion&lt;/a&gt;s, few can be found beyond the &lt;a href=\"tundra\"&gt;tundra&lt;/a&gt;s at the northernmost regions of &lt;a href=\"continental%20shelf\"&gt;continental shelves&lt;/a&gt;. At the southern extremes, plants of the &lt;a href=\"Antarctic%20flora\"&gt;Antarctic flora&lt;/a&gt; have adapted tenaciously to the prevailing conditions.\nPlants are often the dominant physical and structural component of habitats where they occur. Many of the Earth's &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s are named for the type of vegetation because plants are the dominant organisms in those biomes, such as &lt;a href=\"grassland\"&gt;grassland&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tropical%20rainforest\"&gt;tropical rainforest&lt;/a&gt;.\nEcological relationships.\nNumerous animals have coevolved with plants. Many animals &lt;a href=\"pollination\"&gt;pollinate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s in exchange for food in the form of pollen or &lt;a href=\"nectar\"&gt;nectar&lt;/a&gt;. Many animals &lt;a href=\"biological%20dispersal\"&gt;disperse seeds&lt;/a&gt;, often by eating &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; and passing the seeds in their &lt;a href=\"feces\"&gt;feces&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Myrmecophyte\"&gt;Myrmecophyte&lt;/a&gt;s are plants that have coevolved with &lt;a href=\"ant\"&gt;ant&lt;/a&gt;s. The plant provides a home, and sometimes food, for the ants. In exchange, the ants defend the plant from &lt;a href=\"herbivore\"&gt;herbivore&lt;/a&gt;s and sometimes competing plants. Ant wastes provide organic &lt;a href=\"fertilizer\"&gt;fertilizer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe majority of plant species have various kinds of fungi associated with their root systems in a kind of &lt;a href=\"Mutualism%20%28biology%29\"&gt;mutualistic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"symbiosis\"&gt;symbiosis&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"mycorrhiza\"&gt;mycorrhiza&lt;/a&gt;. The fungi help the plants gain water and mineral nutrients from the soil, while the plant gives the fungi carbohydrates manufactured in photosynthesis. Some plants serve as homes for &lt;a href=\"endophyte\"&gt;endophytic&lt;/a&gt; fungi that protect the plant from herbivores by producing toxins. The fungal endophyte, \"&lt;a href=\"Neotyphodium%20coenophialum\"&gt;Neotyphodium coenophialum&lt;/a&gt;\", in &lt;a href=\"tall%20fescue\"&gt;tall fescue&lt;/a&gt; (\"Festuca arundinacea\") does tremendous economic damage to the cattle industry in the U.S. Many legume plants have nitrogen fixing bacteria in the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Rhizobium\"&gt;Rhizobium&lt;/a&gt;\", found in nodules of their roots, that fix nitrogen from the air for the plant to use. In exchange, the plants supply sugars to the bacteria.\nVarious forms of parasitism are also fairly common among plants, from the semi-parasitic &lt;a href=\"mistletoe\"&gt;mistletoe&lt;/a&gt; that merely takes some nutrients from its host, but still has photosynthetic leaves, to the fully parasitic &lt;a href=\"Orobanche\"&gt;broomrape&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lathraea\"&gt;toothwort&lt;/a&gt; that acquire all their nutrients through connections to the roots of other plants, and so have no &lt;a href=\"chlorophyll\"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt;. Some plants, known as &lt;a href=\"myco-heterotroph\"&gt;myco-heterotroph&lt;/a&gt;s, parasitize mycorrhizal fungi, and hence act as &lt;a href=\"epiparasite\"&gt;epiparasite&lt;/a&gt;s on other plants.\nMany plants are &lt;a href=\"epiphyte\"&gt;epiphyte&lt;/a&gt;s, meaning they grow on other plants, usually trees, without parasitizing them. Epiphytes may indirectly harm their host plant by intercepting mineral nutrients and light that the host would otherwise receive. The weight of large numbers of epiphytes may break tree limbs. &lt;a href=\"Hemiepiphyte\"&gt;Hemiepiphyte&lt;/a&gt;s like the &lt;a href=\"strangler%20fig\"&gt;strangler fig&lt;/a&gt; begin as epiphytes but eventually set their own roots and overpower and kill their host. Many &lt;a href=\"orchid\"&gt;orchid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bromeliad\"&gt;bromeliad&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;es often grow as epiphytes. Bromeliad epiphytes accumulate water in leaf axils to form &lt;a href=\"phytotelma\"&gt;phytotelma&lt;/a&gt;ta that may contain complex aquatic food webs.\nApproximately 630 plants are &lt;a href=\"carnivorous%20plant\"&gt;carnivorous&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Venus%20Flytrap\"&gt;Venus Flytrap&lt;/a&gt; (\"Dionaea muscipula\") and &lt;a href=\"sundew\"&gt;sundew&lt;/a&gt; (\"Drosera\" species). They trap small animals and digest them to obtain mineral nutrients, especially &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"phosphorus\"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompetition.\nCompetition occurs when members of the same species, or several different species, compete for shared resources in a given habitat. According to the competitive exclusion principle, when environmental resources are limited, species cannot occupy nor be supported by identical niches. Eventually, one species will out-compete the other, which will push the disadvantaged species to extinction.\nIn regard to plants, competition tends to negatively affect their growth when competing for shared resources. These shared resources commonly include space for growth, sunlight, water and nutrients. Light is an important resource because it is necessary for photosynthesis. Plants use their leaves to shade other plants from sunlight and grow quickly to maximize their own expose. Water is also important for photosynthesis, and plants have different root systems to maximize water uptake from soil. Some plants have deep roots that are able to locate water stored deep underground, and others have shallower roots that are capable of extending longer distances to collect recent rainwater.\nMinerals are also important for plant growth and development, where deficiencies can occur if nutrient needs are not met. Common nutrients competed for amongst plants include nitrogen and phosphorus. Space is also extremely important for a growing and developing plant. Having optimal space makes it more likely that leaves are exposed to sufficient amounts of sunlight and are not overcrowded in order for photosynthesis to occur. If an old tree dies, then competition arises amongst a number of trees to replace it. Those that are less effective competitors are less likely to contribute to the next generation of offspring.\nContrary to the belief that plants are always in competition, new research has found that in a harsh environment mature plants sheltering seedlings help the smaller plant survive. \nImportance.\nCultivation.\nThe study of plant uses by people is called economic botany or &lt;a href=\"ethnobotany\"&gt;ethnobotany&lt;/a&gt;. Human cultivation of plants is part of &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, which is the basis of human civilization. Plant agriculture is subdivided into &lt;a href=\"agronomy\"&gt;agronomy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horticulture\"&gt;horticulture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"forestry\"&gt;forestry&lt;/a&gt;.\nFood.\nHumans depend on plants for &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, either directly or as feed for &lt;a href=\"domestic%20animal\"&gt;domestic animal&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Agriculture\"&gt;Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; deals with the production of food crops, and has &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20agriculture\"&gt;played a key role in the history of world civilizations&lt;/a&gt;. Agriculture includes &lt;a href=\"agronomy\"&gt;agronomy&lt;/a&gt; for arable crops, &lt;a href=\"horticulture\"&gt;horticulture&lt;/a&gt; for vegetables and fruit, and &lt;a href=\"forestry\"&gt;forestry&lt;/a&gt; for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major &lt;a href=\"staple%20crop\"&gt;staples&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href=\"cereal\"&gt;cereal&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, starchy roots and tubers such as &lt;a href=\"cassava\"&gt;cassava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"legume\"&gt;legume&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"peas\"&gt;peas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bean\"&gt;bean&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Vegetable%20oil\"&gt;Vegetable oil&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"olive%20oil\"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"palm%20oil\"&gt;palm oil&lt;/a&gt; provide &lt;a href=\"lipids\"&gt;lipids&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vegetable\"&gt;vegetable&lt;/a&gt;s contribute &lt;a href=\"vitamin\"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt;s and minerals to the diet.\nMedicines.\n&lt;a href=\"Medicinal%20plants\"&gt;Medicinal plants&lt;/a&gt; are a primary source of &lt;a href=\"organic%20compound\"&gt;organic compound&lt;/a&gt;s, both for their medicinal and physiological effects, and for the industrial &lt;a href=\"organic%20synthesis\"&gt;synthesis&lt;/a&gt; of a vast array of organic chemicals. Many hundreds of medicines are derived from plants, both traditional medicines used in &lt;a href=\"herbalism\"&gt;herbalism&lt;/a&gt; and chemical substances purified from plants or first identified in them, sometimes by &lt;a href=\"ethnobotany\"&gt;ethnobotanical&lt;/a&gt; search, and then &lt;a href=\"organic%20synthesis\"&gt;synthesised&lt;/a&gt; for use in modern medicine. Modern medicines derived from plants include &lt;a href=\"aspirin\"&gt;aspirin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"taxol\"&gt;taxol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"morphine\"&gt;morphine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"quinine\"&gt;quinine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"reserpine\"&gt;reserpine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"colchicine\"&gt;colchicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"digitalis\"&gt;digitalis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vincristine\"&gt;vincristine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20plants%20used%20in%20herbalism\"&gt;Plants used in herbalism&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href=\"Ginkgo%20biloba\"&gt;ginkgo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"echinacea\"&gt;echinacea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"feverfew\"&gt;feverfew&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20John%27s%20wort\"&gt;Saint John's wort&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"pharmacopoeia\"&gt;pharmacopoeia&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dioscorides\"&gt;Dioscorides&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"De%20Materia%20Medica\"&gt;De Materia Medica&lt;/a&gt;\", describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.\nNonfood products.\nPlants grown as industrial crops are the source of a wide range of products used in manufacturing, sometimes so intensively as to risk harm to the environment. Nonfood products include &lt;a href=\"essential%20oil\"&gt;essential oil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"natural%20dye\"&gt;natural dye&lt;/a&gt;s, pigments, &lt;a href=\"wax\"&gt;wax&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"resin\"&gt;resin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tannin\"&gt;tannin&lt;/a&gt;s, alkaloids, &lt;a href=\"amber\"&gt;amber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cork%20material\"&gt;cork&lt;/a&gt;. Products derived from plants include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, &lt;a href=\"latex\"&gt;latex&lt;/a&gt;, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and &lt;a href=\"Gum%20%28botany%29\"&gt;gums&lt;/a&gt;. Renewable fuels from plants include &lt;a href=\"firewood\"&gt;firewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"peat\"&gt;peat&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"biofuel\"&gt;biofuel&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"fossil%20fuel\"&gt;fossil fuel&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"petroleum\"&gt;petroleum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"natural%20gas\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including &lt;a href=\"phytoplankton\"&gt;phytoplankton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"geological%20time\"&gt;geological time&lt;/a&gt;.\nStructural resources and fibres from plants are used to construct dwellings and to manufacture clothing. &lt;a href=\"Wood\"&gt;Wood&lt;/a&gt; is used not only for buildings, boats, and furniture, but also for smaller items such as &lt;a href=\"musical%20instrument\"&gt;musical instrument&lt;/a&gt;s and sports equipment. Wood is &lt;a href=\"Pulp%20%28paper%29\"&gt;pulped&lt;/a&gt; to make paper and cardboard. Cloth is often made from &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flax\"&gt;flax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ramie\"&gt;ramie&lt;/a&gt; or synthetic fibres such as &lt;a href=\"rayon\"&gt;rayon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"acetate\"&gt;acetate&lt;/a&gt; derived from plant &lt;a href=\"cellulose\"&gt;cellulose&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thread%20%28yarn%29\"&gt;Thread&lt;/a&gt; used to sew cloth likewise comes in large part from cotton.\nAesthetic uses.\nThousands of plant species are cultivated for aesthetic purposes as well as to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to &lt;a href=\"garden%20tourism\"&gt;historic gardens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"national%20park\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rainforest\"&gt;rainforest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as &lt;a href=\"Hanami\"&gt;Japan's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"National%20Cherry%20Blossom%20Festival\"&gt;America's cherry blossom festivals&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile some &lt;a href=\"garden\"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt;s are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. &lt;a href=\"Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"botanical%20garden\"&gt;botanical garden&lt;/a&gt;s are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardens may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with &lt;a href=\"topiary\"&gt;topiary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"espalier\"&gt;espalier&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gardening\"&gt;Gardening&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or &lt;a href=\"horticulture%20therapy\"&gt;horticulture therapy&lt;/a&gt; is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities.\nPlants may also be grown or kept indoors as &lt;a href=\"houseplant\"&gt;houseplant&lt;/a&gt;s, or in specialized buildings such as &lt;a href=\"greenhouse\"&gt;greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;s that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. &lt;a href=\"Venus%20Flytrap\"&gt;Venus Flytrap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sensitive%20plant\"&gt;sensitive plant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"resurrection%20plant\"&gt;resurrection plant&lt;/a&gt; are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as &lt;a href=\"bonsai\"&gt;bonsai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ikebana\"&gt;ikebana&lt;/a&gt;, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. &lt;a href=\"Ornamental%20plant\"&gt;Ornamental plant&lt;/a&gt;s have sometimes changed the course of history, as in &lt;a href=\"tulip%20mania\"&gt;tulipomania&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitectural designs resembling plants appear in the capitals of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;Ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian columns, which were carved to resemble either the &lt;a href=\"Nymphaea%20lotus\"&gt;Egyptian white lotus&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Cyperus%20papyrus\"&gt;papyrus&lt;/a&gt;. Images of plants are often used in painting and photography, as well as on textiles, money, stamps, flags and coats of arms.\nScientific and cultural uses.\nBasic biological research has often been done with plants. In &lt;a href=\"genetics\"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, the breeding of pea plants allowed &lt;a href=\"Gregor%20Mendel\"&gt;Gregor Mendel&lt;/a&gt; to derive the basic laws governing inheritance, and examination of &lt;a href=\"chromosome\"&gt;chromosome&lt;/a&gt;s in maize allowed &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20McClintock\"&gt;Barbara McClintock&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate their connection to inherited traits. The plant \"&lt;a href=\"Arabidopsis%20thaliana\"&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/a&gt;\" is used in laboratories as a &lt;a href=\"model%20organism\"&gt;model organism&lt;/a&gt; to understand how &lt;a href=\"gene\"&gt;gene&lt;/a&gt;s control the growth and development of plant structures. &lt;a href=\"NASA\"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; predicts that space stations or space colonies will one day rely on plants for &lt;a href=\"Controlled%20Ecological%20Life%20Support%20System\"&gt;life support&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncient trees are revered and many are &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20famous%20trees\"&gt;famous&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tree%20ring\"&gt;Tree ring&lt;/a&gt;s themselves are an important method of dating in archeology, and serve as a record of past climates.\nPlants figure prominently in &lt;a href=\"Trees%20in%20mythology\"&gt;mythology&lt;/a&gt;, religion and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20fictional%20plants\"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt;. They are used as &lt;a href=\"National%20emblem\"&gt;national&lt;/a&gt; and state emblems, including &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20trees\"&gt;state trees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"state%20flower\"&gt;state flower&lt;/a&gt;s. Plants are often used as memorials, gifts and to mark special occasions such as births, deaths, weddings and holidays. The arrangement of flowers may be used to send hidden &lt;a href=\"Language%20of%20flowers\"&gt;messages&lt;/a&gt;.\nNegative effects.\n&lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;Weed&lt;/a&gt;s are commercially or aesthetically undesirable plants growing in managed environments such as &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"urban%20area\"&gt;urban area&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"garden\"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lawn\"&gt;lawn&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"park\"&gt;park&lt;/a&gt;s. People have spread plants beyond their native ranges and some of these introduced plants become &lt;a href=\"invasive%20species\"&gt;invasive&lt;/a&gt;, damaging existing ecosystems by displacing native species, and sometimes becoming serious weeds of cultivation.\nPlants may cause harm to animals, including people. Plants that produce &lt;a href=\"anemophily\"&gt;windblown pollen&lt;/a&gt; invoke allergic reactions in people who suffer from &lt;a href=\"hay%20fever\"&gt;hay fever&lt;/a&gt;. A wide variety of plants are &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20poisonous%20plants\"&gt;poisonous&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Toxalbumin\"&gt;Toxalbumin&lt;/a&gt;s are plant poisons fatal to most mammals and act as a serious deterrent to consumption. Several plants cause skin irritations when touched, such as &lt;a href=\"poison%20ivy\"&gt;poison ivy&lt;/a&gt;. Certain plants contain &lt;a href=\"psychotropic\"&gt;psychotropic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"secondary%20metabolite\"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, which are extracted and ingested or smoked, including &lt;a href=\"nicotine\"&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"tobacco\"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cannabinoids\"&gt;cannabinoids&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Cannabis%20sativa\"&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Erythroxylon%20coca\"&gt;Erythroxylon coca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"opium\"&gt;opium&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"opium%20poppy\"&gt;opium poppy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Smoking\"&gt;Smoking&lt;/a&gt; causes damage to health or even death, while some drugs may also be harmful or fatal to people. Both illegal and legal drugs derived from plants may have negative effects on the economy, affecting worker productivity and law enforcement costs."
