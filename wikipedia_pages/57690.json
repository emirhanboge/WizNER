    "text": "Montgomery is the &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alabama\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Montgomery County&lt;/a&gt;. Named for &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Montgomery\"&gt;Richard Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;, it stands beside the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20River\"&gt;Alabama River&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coastal%20Plain\"&gt;coastal Plain of the Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20census\"&gt;2020 Census&lt;/a&gt;, Montgomery's population was 200,603. It is the third most populous city in Alabama, after &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huntsville%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Huntsville&lt;/a&gt;, and is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20cities%20by%20population\"&gt;119th most populous&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. The &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Metropolitan%20Area\"&gt;Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt;'s population in 2020 was 386,047; it is the fourth largest in the state and 142nd among &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20metropolitan%20statistical%20areas\"&gt;United States metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe city was incorporated in 1819 as a merger of two towns situated along the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20River\"&gt;Alabama River&lt;/a&gt;. It became the state capital in 1846, representing the shift of power to the south-central area of Alabama with the growth of cotton as a commodity crop of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Belt%20%28geological%20formation%29\"&gt;Black Belt&lt;/a&gt; and the rise of &lt;a href=\"Mobile%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt; as a mercantile port on the Gulf Coast. In February 1861, Montgomery was chosen the first capital of the &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;Confederate States of America&lt;/a&gt;, which it remained until the Confederate seat of government moved to &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Richmond, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, in May of that year. In the middle of the 20th century, Montgomery was a major center of events and protests in the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Rights%20Movement\"&gt;Civil Rights Movement&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20bus%20boycott\"&gt;Montgomery bus boycott&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Selma%20to%20Montgomery%20marches\"&gt;Selma to Montgomery marches&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to housing many Alabama government agencies, Montgomery has a large &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; presence, due to &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Maxwell Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;; public universities &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20State%20University\"&gt;Alabama State University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troy%20University\"&gt;Troy University&lt;/a&gt; (Montgomery campus), and &lt;a href=\"Auburn%20University%20at%20Montgomery\"&gt;Auburn University at Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;; two private post-secondary institutions, &lt;a href=\"Faulkner%20University\"&gt;Faulkner University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huntingdon%20College\"&gt;Huntingdon College&lt;/a&gt;; high-tech manufacturing, including &lt;a href=\"Hyundai%20Motor%20Manufacturing%20Alabama\"&gt;Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama&lt;/a&gt;; and many cultural attractions, such as the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20Shakespeare%20Festival\"&gt;Alabama Shakespeare Festival&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts\"&gt;Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo ships of the United States Navy have been named after the city, including .\nMontgomery has also been recognized nationally for its downtown revitalization and new urbanism projects. It was one of the first cities in the nation to implement &lt;a href=\"SmartCode\"&gt;SmartCode Zoning&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPrior to European colonization, the east bank of the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20River\"&gt;Alabama River&lt;/a&gt; was inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20%28people%29\"&gt;Alibamu tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt;. The Alibamu and the &lt;a href=\"Coushatta\"&gt;Coushatta&lt;/a&gt;, who lived on the west side of the river, were descended from the &lt;a href=\"Mississippian%20culture\"&gt;Mississippian culture&lt;/a&gt;. This civilization had numerous chiefdoms throughout the Midwest and South along the Mississippi and its tributaries, and had built massive &lt;a href=\"earthworks%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;earthwork&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mound\"&gt;mound&lt;/a&gt;s as part of their society about 950\u20131250 AD. Its largest location was at &lt;a href=\"Cahokia\"&gt;Cahokia&lt;/a&gt;, in present-day &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; east of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe historic tribes spoke mutually intelligible &lt;a href=\"Muskogean%20language\"&gt;Muskogean language&lt;/a&gt;s, which were closely related. Present-day Montgomery is built on the site of two Alibamu towns: \"Ikanatchati\" (Ekanchattee or Ecunchatty or Econachatee), meaning \"red earth;\" and \"Towassa\", built on a &lt;a href=\"Beach%20ridge\"&gt;bluff&lt;/a&gt; called \"Chunnaanaauga Chatty.\" The first Europeans to travel through central Alabama were &lt;a href=\"Hernando%20de%20Soto\"&gt;Hernando de Soto&lt;/a&gt; and his expedition, who in 1540 recorded going through Ikanatchati and camping for one week in Towassa.\nThe next recorded European encounter occurred more than a century later, when an English expedition from &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Carolina\"&gt;Carolina&lt;/a&gt; went down the Alabama River in 1697. The first permanent European settler in the Montgomery area was &lt;a href=\"James%20McQueen%20%28pioneer%29\"&gt;James McQueen&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20people\"&gt;Scots&lt;/a&gt; trader who settled there in 1716. He married a high-status woman in the Coushatta or Alabama tribe. Their &lt;a href=\"mixed-race\"&gt;mixed-race&lt;/a&gt; children were considered Muskogean, as both tribes had a &lt;a href=\"matrilineal\"&gt;matrilineal&lt;/a&gt; system of property and descent. The children were always considered born into their mother's &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;, and gained their status from her people.\nIn 1785, Abraham Mordecai, a war veteran from a &lt;a href=\"Sephardic%20Jewish\"&gt;Sephardic Jewish&lt;/a&gt; family of &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, Pennsylvania, established a &lt;a href=\"trading%20post\"&gt;trading post&lt;/a&gt;. The Coushatta and Alabama had gradually moved south and west in the tidal plain. After the French were defeated by the British in 1763 in the &lt;a href=\"French%20and%20Indian%20War\"&gt;Seven Years' War&lt;/a&gt; and ceded control of their lands, these Native American peoples moved to parts of present-day Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, then &lt;a href=\"New%20Spain\"&gt;areas of Spanish rule&lt;/a&gt;, which they thought more favorable than British-held areas. By the time Mordecai arrived, &lt;a href=\"Creek%20people\"&gt;Creek&lt;/a&gt; had migrated into and settled in the area, as they were moving away from &lt;a href=\"Cherokee\"&gt;Cherokee&lt;/a&gt; and Iroquois warfare to the north. Mordecai married a Creek woman. When her people had to cede most of their lands after the 1813-14 &lt;a href=\"Creek%20War\"&gt;Creek War&lt;/a&gt;, she joined them in removal to Indian Territory. Mordecai brought the first &lt;a href=\"cotton%20gin\"&gt;cotton gin&lt;/a&gt; to Alabama.\nThe Upper Creek were able to discourage most white immigration until after the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Creek%20War\"&gt;Creek War&lt;/a&gt;. Following their defeat by General &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Jackson\"&gt;Andrew Jackson&lt;/a&gt; in August 1814, the Creek tribes were forced to cede 23\u00a0million acres to the United States, including remaining land in today's Georgia and most of today's central and southern Alabama. In 1816, the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20Territory\"&gt;Mississippi Territory&lt;/a&gt; (1798\u20131817) organized &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Montgomery County&lt;/a&gt;. Its former Creek lands were sold off the next year at the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; land office in &lt;a href=\"Milledgeville%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Milledgeville, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first group of white settlers to come to the Montgomery area was headed by General &lt;a href=\"John%20Scott%20%28Alabama%29\"&gt;John Scott&lt;/a&gt;. This group founded Alabama Town about downstream on the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20River\"&gt;Alabama River&lt;/a&gt; from present-day downtown Montgomery. In June 1818, county courts were moved from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Jackson%20%28Alabama%29\"&gt;Fort Jackson&lt;/a&gt; to Alabama Town. Alabama was admitted to the Union in December 1819.\nSoon after, &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Dexter%20Jr.\"&gt;Andrew Dexter Jr.&lt;/a&gt; founded New Philadelphia, the present-day eastern part of downtown. He envisioned a prominent future for his town; he set aside a hilltop known as \"Goat Hill\" as the future site of the state capitol building. New Philadelphia soon prospered, and Scott and his associates built a new town adjacent, calling it East Alabama Town. Originally rivals, the towns merged on December 3, 1819, and were incorporated as the town of Montgomery.\n The name Montgomery came from &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Montgomery\"&gt;Richard Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt; general.\nSlave traders used the Alabama River to deliver slaves to planters as laborers to work the cotton. Buoyed by the revenues of the &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; trade at a time of high market demand, the newly united Montgomery grew quickly. In 1822, the city was designated as the county seat. A new courthouse was built at the present location of Court Square, at the foot of Market Street (now Dexter Avenue). Court Square had one of the largest slave markets in the South. The state capital was moved from &lt;a href=\"Tuscaloosa%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Tuscaloosa&lt;/a&gt; to Montgomery, on January 28, 1846.\nAs state capital, Montgomery began to influence state politics, and it would also play a prominent role on the national stage. Beginning February 4, 1861, representatives from Alabama, &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, Florida, &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina\"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Convention\"&gt;met in Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;, host of the \"Southern Convention\", to form the &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;Confederate States of America&lt;/a&gt;. Montgomery was named the first capital of the nation, and &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20Davis\"&gt;Jefferson Davis&lt;/a&gt; was inaugurated as president on the steps of the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20State%20Capitol\"&gt;State Capitol&lt;/a&gt;. (The capital was later moved to Richmond, Virginia.)\nOn April 12, 1865, following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Selma\"&gt;Battle of Selma&lt;/a&gt;, Major General &lt;a href=\"James%20H.%20Wilson\"&gt;James H. Wilson&lt;/a&gt; captured Montgomery for the Union.\nIn 1886 Montgomery became the first city in the United States to install citywide electric &lt;a href=\"streetcars\"&gt;streetcars&lt;/a&gt; along a system that was nicknamed the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Route\"&gt;Lightning Route&lt;/a&gt;. Residents followed the streetcar lines to settle in new housing in what were then \"suburban\" locations.\n As the &lt;a href=\"Reconstruction%20era\"&gt;Reconstruction era&lt;/a&gt; ended, mayor W. L. Moses asked the state legislature to &lt;a href=\"gerrymander\"&gt;gerrymander&lt;/a&gt; city boundaries. It complied and removed the districts where African Americans lived, restoring white supremacy to the city's demographics and electorate. This prevented African Americans from being elected in the municipality and denied them city services. \nIn the post-World War II era, returning African-American veterans were among those who became active in pushing to regain their civil rights in the South: to be allowed to vote and participate in politics, to freely use public places, to end segregation. According to the historian &lt;a href=\"David%20Beito\"&gt;David Beito&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Alabama\"&gt;University of Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, African Americans in Montgomery \"nurtured the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Rights%20Movement\"&gt;modern civil rights movement&lt;/a&gt;.\" African Americans comprised most of the customers on the city buses, but were forced to give up seats and even stand in order to make room for whites. On December 1, 1955, &lt;a href=\"Rosa%20Parks\"&gt;Rosa Parks&lt;/a&gt; was arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man, sparking the &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20bus%20boycott\"&gt;Montgomery bus boycott&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.\"&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, then the pastor of &lt;a href=\"Dexter%20Avenue%20Baptist%20Church\"&gt;Dexter Avenue Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"E.D.%20Nixon\"&gt;E.D. Nixon&lt;/a&gt;, a local civil rights advocate, founded the &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Improvement%20Association\"&gt;Montgomery Improvement Association&lt;/a&gt; to organize the boycott. In June 1956, the US District Court Judge &lt;a href=\"Frank%20M.%20Johnson\"&gt;Frank M. Johnson&lt;/a&gt; ruled that Montgomery's bus &lt;a href=\"racial%20segregation\"&gt;racial segregation&lt;/a&gt; was unconstitutional. After the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;US Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; upheld the ruling in November, the city desegregated the bus system, and the boycott was ended.\nIn separate action, integrated teams of &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20Riders\"&gt;Freedom Riders&lt;/a&gt; rode South on interstate buses. In violation of federal law and the constitution, bus companies had for decades acceded to state laws and required passengers to occupy segregated seating in Southern states. Opponents of the push for integration organized mob violence at stops along the Freedom Ride. In Montgomery, there was police collaboration when a white mob attacked Freedom Riders at the &lt;a href=\"Greyhound%20Bus%20Station%20%28Montgomery%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Greyhound Bus Station&lt;/a&gt; in May 1961. Outraged national reaction resulted in the enforcement of desegregation of interstate public transportation.\nMartin Luther King Jr. returned to Montgomery in 1965. Local civil rights leaders in &lt;a href=\"Selma%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Selma&lt;/a&gt; had been protesting &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Crow%20laws\"&gt;Jim Crow laws&lt;/a&gt; and practices that raised barriers to blacks registering to vote. Following the shooting of a man after a civil rights rally, the leaders decided to &lt;a href=\"Selma%20to%20Montgomery%20marches\"&gt;march to Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; to petition Governor &lt;a href=\"George%20Wallace\"&gt;George Wallace&lt;/a&gt; to allow free voter registration. The violence they encountered from county and state highway police outraged the country. The federal government ordered National Guard and troops to protect the marchers. Thousands more joined the marchers on the way to Montgomery, and an estimated 25,000 marchers entered the capital to press for voting rights. These actions contributed to Congressional passage of the &lt;a href=\"Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965\"&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965&lt;/a&gt;, to authorize federal supervision and enforcement of the rights of African Americans and other minorities to vote.\nOn February 7, 1967, a devastating fire broke out at Dale's Penthouse, a restaurant and lounge on the top floor of the Walter Bragg Smith apartment building (now called Capital Towers) at 7 Clayton Street downtown. Twenty-six people died.\nIn recent years, Montgomery has grown and diversified its economy. Active in downtown revitalization, the city adopted a master plan in 2007; it includes the revitalization of Court Square and the riverfront, renewing the city's connection to the river. Many other projects under construction include the revitalization of Historic Dexter Avenue, pedestrian and infrastructure improvements along the &lt;a href=\"Selma%20to%20Montgomery%20National%20Historic%20Trail\"&gt;Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail&lt;/a&gt;, and the construction of a new environmental park on West Fairview Avenue.\nGeography.\nMontgomery is located at .\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.52%) is water. The city is built over rolling terrain at an elevation of about above sea level.\nCityscape.\nDowntown Montgomery lies along the southern bank of the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20River\"&gt;Alabama River&lt;/a&gt;, about downstream from the confluence of the &lt;a href=\"Coosa%20River\"&gt;Coosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tallapoosa%20River\"&gt;Tallapoosa&lt;/a&gt; rivers. The most prominent feature of Montgomery's skyline is the , RSA Tower, built in 1996 by the &lt;a href=\"Retirement%20Systems%20of%20Alabama\"&gt;Retirement Systems of Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. Other prominent buildings include 60 Commerce Street, 8 Commerce Street, and the &lt;a href=\"RSA%20Dexter%20Avenue%20Building\"&gt;RSA Dexter Avenue Building&lt;/a&gt;. Downtown also contains many state and local government buildings, including the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20State%20Capitol\"&gt;Alabama State Capitol&lt;/a&gt;. The Capitol is located atop a hill at one end of Dexter Avenue, along which also lies the &lt;a href=\"Dexter%20Avenue%20Baptist%20Church\"&gt;Dexter Avenue Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.\"&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/a&gt; was pastor. Both the Capitol and Dexter Baptist Church are recognized as &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt;s by the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior\"&gt;U.S. Department of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;. Other notable buildings include RSA Dexter Avenue, RSA Headquarters, Alabama Center for Commerce, RSA Union, and the Renaissance Hotel and Spa.\nOne block south of the Capitol is the &lt;a href=\"First%20White%20House%20of%20the%20Confederacy\"&gt;First White House of the Confederacy&lt;/a&gt;, the 1835 Italianate-style house in which President Jefferson Davis and family lived while the Confederate capital was in Montgomery. Montgomery's third National Historic Landmark is &lt;a href=\"Union%20Station%20%28Montgomery%29\"&gt;Union Station&lt;/a&gt;. Passenger train service to Montgomery ceased in 1989. Today Union Station is part of the Riverfront Park development, which includes an amphitheater, a &lt;a href=\"Paddle%20steamer\"&gt;riverboat&lt;/a&gt; dock, a river walk, and &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Riverwalk%20Stadium\"&gt;Riverwalk Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThree blocks east of the Convention Center, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Alabama%20Town\"&gt;Old Alabama Town&lt;/a&gt; showcases more than 50 restored buildings from the 19th century. The Riverwalk is part of a larger plan to revitalize the downtown area and connect it to the waterfront. The plan includes &lt;a href=\"urban%20forestry\"&gt;urban forestry&lt;/a&gt;, infill development, and fa\u00e7ade renovation to encourage business and residential growth. A The Convention Center, completed in 2007, has encouraged growth and activity in the downtown area, and attracted more high-end retail and restaurants.\nOther downtown developments include historic Dexter Avenue, which will be the center of a Market District. A $6\u00a0million streetscape project is improving its design. Maxwell Boulevard is home to the newly built &lt;a href=\"Wright%20Brothers\"&gt;Wright Brothers&lt;/a&gt; Park. High-end apartments are planned for this area. The &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Building%20%28Montgomery%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Bell Building&lt;/a&gt;, located across from the Rosa Parks Library and Museum, is being redeveloped for mixed-use retail and residential space.\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Memorial%20for%20Peace%20and%20Justice\"&gt;National Memorial for Peace and Justice&lt;/a&gt; opened in downtown Montgomery on April 26, 2018. Founded by the &lt;a href=\"Equal%20Justice%20Initiative\"&gt;Equal Justice Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, it acknowledges the historic past of racial terrorism and lynching in America.\nSouth of downtown, across &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2085\"&gt;Interstate 85&lt;/a&gt;, lies &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20State%20University\"&gt;Alabama State University&lt;/a&gt;. ASU's campus was built in &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Colonial Revival&lt;/a&gt; architectural style from 1906 until the beginning of World War II. Surrounding ASU are the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20District%20%28Montgomery%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Garden District&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cloverdale%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Cloverdale Historic District&lt;/a&gt;. Houses in these areas date from around 1875 until 1949, and are in &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20architecture\"&gt;Late Victorian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic Revival&lt;/a&gt; styles. &lt;a href=\"Huntingdon%20College\"&gt;Huntingdon College&lt;/a&gt; is on the southwestern edge of Cloverdale. The campus was built in the 1900s in &lt;a href=\"Tudorbethan%20architecture\"&gt;Tudor Revival&lt;/a&gt; and Gothic Revival styles. ASU, the Garden District, Cloverdale, and Huntingdon are all listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"historic%20district%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;historic district&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMontgomery's east side is the fastest-growing part of the city. Development of the Dalraida neighborhood, along Atlanta Highway, began in 1909, when developers Cook and Laurie bought land from the Ware plantation. A Scotsman, Georgie Laurie named the area for &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A1l%20Riata\"&gt;D\u00e1l Riata&lt;/a&gt;, a 6th-7th century Gaelic overkingdom; a subsequent misspelling in an advertisement led to the current spelling. The first lots were sold in 1914. The city's two largest shopping malls (&lt;a href=\"Eastdale%20Mall\"&gt;Eastdale Mall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Shoppes%20at%20Eastchase\"&gt;The Shoppes at Eastchase&lt;/a&gt;), as well as many &lt;a href=\"big-box%20stores\"&gt;big-box stores&lt;/a&gt; and residential developments, are on the east side.\nThe area is also home of the &lt;a href=\"Wynton%20M.%20Blount%20Cultural%20Park\"&gt;Wynton M. Blount Cultural Park&lt;/a&gt;. This park contains the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20Shakespeare%20Festival\"&gt;Alabama Shakespeare Festival&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts\"&gt;Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts&lt;/a&gt;.\nRevitalization.\nMontgomery has been recognized nationally for its continuing downtown revitalization. In the early 2000s, the city constructed the &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Biscuits\"&gt;Montgomery Biscuits&lt;/a&gt; minor league baseball stadium and Riverfront Park. Following those developments, hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested by private companies that have adapted old warehouses and office buildings into loft apartments, restaurants, retail, hotels, and businesses. The demand for downtown living space has risen, as people want to have walkable, lively neighborhoods. More than 500 apartment units are under construction, including The Heights on Maxwell Boulevard, The Market District on Dexter Avenue, the Kress Building on Dexter Avenue, The &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Building%20%28Montgomery%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Bell Building&lt;/a&gt; on Montgomery Street, and a new complex by the convention center.\nClimate.\nMontgomery has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; \"Cfa\"), with short, mild winters, warm springs and autumns, and long, hot, humid summers. The daily average temperature in January is , and there are 3.4 days of sub lows; and below is extremely rare. The daily average in July is , with highs exceeding on 86 days per year and on 3.9. Summer afternoon heat indices, much more often than the actual air temperature, are frequently at or above 100\u00a0\u00b0F. The &lt;a href=\"diurnal%20temperature%20variation\"&gt;diurnal temperature variation&lt;/a&gt; tends to be large in spring and autumn. Rainfall is well-distributed throughout the year, though February, March and July are the wettest months, while October is significantly the driest month. Snowfall occurs only during some winters, and even then is usually light. Substantial snowstorms are rare, but do occur approximately once every 10 years. Extremes range from on &lt;a href=\"Great%20Blizzard%20of%201899\"&gt;February 13, 1899&lt;/a&gt; to on July 7, 1881.\nThunderstorms bring much of Montgomery's rainfall. These are common during the summer months but occur throughout the year.

Service continued until 1979, when &lt;a href=\"Amtrak\"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt; terminated its &lt;a href=\"Floridian%20%28Amtrak%29\"&gt;Floridian&lt;/a&gt; route. Amtrak returned from 1989 until 1995 with the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Breeze%20%28Amtrak%29\"&gt;Gulf Breeze&lt;/a&gt;, an extension of the &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20%28Amtrak%29\"&gt;Crescent&lt;/a&gt; line.\nAccording to the 2016 &lt;a href=\"American%20Community%20Survey\"&gt;American Community Survey&lt;/a&gt;, 84.3% of working city of Montgomery residents commuted by driving alone, 8.8% carpooled, 0.4% used public transportation, and 0.6% walked.
