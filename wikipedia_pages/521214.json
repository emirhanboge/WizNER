    "text": "Pinus clausa is a species of &lt;a href=\"pine\"&gt;pine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southeastern United States&lt;/a&gt;. Its common names include sand pine, Florida spruce pine, Alabama pine, and scrub pine.\nDistribution.\nThe tree is found in two separate locations, one across central peninsular &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and the other along the western Florida panhandle coast into the &lt;a href=\"Alabama\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; coast. There is a range gap of about between the populations (from &lt;a href=\"Apalachicola%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Apalachicola&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Key%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Cedar Key&lt;/a&gt;).\nIt is largely confined to very &lt;a href=\"Fertility%20%28soil%29\"&gt;infertile&lt;/a&gt;, excessively well-drained, sandy habitats where competition from larger-growing species is minimized by the harsh growing conditions of hot sun, fast-draining white sands, and frequent severe seasonal droughts. It is often the only canopy tree in the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20scrub\"&gt;Florida scrub&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem.\nDescription.\n\"Pinus clausa\" is a small, often &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt;by &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; from , exceptionally to tall.\nThe &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are needle-like, in pairs, long, and its &lt;a href=\"conifer%20cone\"&gt;cones&lt;/a&gt; are long.\nOver much of its range, it is fire-adapted to stand-replacing &lt;a href=\"wildfire\"&gt;wildfire&lt;/a&gt;s, with the cones remaining closed for many years (\"clausa\" = closed), until a natural forest fire kills the mature trees and opens the cones. These then reseed the burnt ground. Some populations differ in having cones that open at maturity, with seed dispersal not relying on fires.\nUses.\n\"Pinus clausa\" woodlands are an important part of the Florida scrub ecosystem, and provide habitat for the endangered &lt;a href=\"Neoseps\"&gt;Florida Sand Skink&lt;/a&gt;, among other species. It is one of the few canopy trees able to grow in arid, sandy, and hot locations with minimal care.\nWhile the dense branching makes this tree unsuitable for &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; production, it is often used for &lt;a href=\"Pulp%20%28paper%29\"&gt;wood pulp&lt;/a&gt;."
