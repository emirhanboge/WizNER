    "text": "Livermore Falls is a &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Androscoggin%20County%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Androscoggin County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maine\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The population was 3,060 at the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2020 census&lt;/a&gt;. It is included in both the &lt;a href=\"Lewiston%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Lewiston&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Auburn%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Auburn&lt;/a&gt;, Maine &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Statistical%20Area\"&gt;Metropolitan Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt; and the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine Metropolitan &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20City%20and%20Town%20Area\"&gt;New England City and Town Area&lt;/a&gt;. High school students in Livermore Falls attend &lt;a href=\"Spruce%20Mountain%20High%20School\"&gt;Spruce Mountain High School&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe area was once part of the &lt;a href=\"Abenaki\"&gt;Abenaki&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; territory called Rockemeka, meaning \"great corn place.\" It would be granted by the &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20General%20Court\"&gt;General Court&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; in 1771 as Port Royal, awarded to heirs of veterans who served in the campaign against &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Waterloo%20%28ABBA%20song%29\"&gt;Battle of Waterloo&lt;/a&gt;. It was settled in 1786, then incorporated in 1795 as &lt;a href=\"Livermore%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Livermore&lt;/a&gt; after Deacon Elijah Livermore, one of the first &lt;a href=\"English%20people\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; settlers. The county line, determined by the &lt;a href=\"Androscoggin%20River\"&gt;Androscoggin River&lt;/a&gt;, divided the town. West of the river was &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20County%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Oxford County&lt;/a&gt;, and east was &lt;a href=\"Kennebec%20County\"&gt;Kennebec County&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, East Livermore (which encompassed a quarter of the original Port Royal grant) was set off and incorporated on March 1, 1844. It became part of Androscoggin County on March 31, 1854. In 1930, East Livermore was renamed Livermore Falls.\nIn the early 19th century, the region was predominantly farmland, with apple orchards and dairies supplying markets at &lt;a href=\"Boston%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;. It was noted for fine cattle. As the century progressed, gristmills, sawmills, logging and lumber became important industries, operated by water power from falls that drop 14 feet. With the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Androscoggin%20Railroad\"&gt;Androscoggin Railroad&lt;/a&gt; in 1852, Livermore Falls developed as a small mill town. Shoe factories and &lt;a href=\"paper%20mill\"&gt;paper mill&lt;/a&gt;s were established, including the Umbagog Pulp Company started by &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20J.%20Chisholm\"&gt;Hugh J. Chisholm&lt;/a&gt;. In 1897, the Third Bridge was built across the Androscoggin. It measured 800 feet in length, at that time the longest single-&lt;a href=\"span%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;span&lt;/a&gt; bridge in &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Livermore Falls is drained by the &lt;a href=\"Androscoggin%20River\"&gt;Androscoggin River&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nThis &lt;a href=\"climate\"&gt;climatic&lt;/a&gt; region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20Climate%20Classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification&lt;/a&gt; system, Livermore Falls has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20continental%20climate\"&gt;humid continental climate&lt;/a&gt;, abbreviated \"Dfb\" on climate maps.\nDemographics.\n2010 census.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2010, there were 3,187 people, 1,316 households, and 809 families living in the town.

MSAD 36 was renamed RSU 36 in 2009. The three schools in the district are Livermore Elementary School, Livermore Falls Middle School and Livermore Falls High School.\nIn 2010 RSU 36 consolidated with Jay Schools to form RSU 73 encompassing Jay, Livermore and Livermore Falls. Jay High School and Livermore Falls High School were renamed Spruce Mountain High School North and South campuses respectively. The Tigers and Andies mascots were replaced by the Spruce Mountain Phoenix. Livermore Falls Middle School was closed in the summer of 2011 and the students and faculty were incorporated into the new Spruce Mountain Middle School located at the former Jay Middle School building. Plans to unite the two high schools under one roof are being laid with a number of options available, a) Extend the current North Campus facility to accommodate the students and staff from the South Campus, b) Install portable buildings to increase the space at North Campus to facilitate the union of the high schools, c) relocate the Spruce Mountain Middle School to the South Campus and move the South Campus High School to the North Campus. The vote to allow the raising of a bond to enable the building of the planned extension failed in early 2012 and the other options are being examined."
