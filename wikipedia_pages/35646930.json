He completed the majority of drills, but skipped the short shuttle and three-cone due to a leg cramp. On March 8, 2012, Benjamin attended Miami's pro day and performed the short shuttle, three-cone drill, and positional drills. 66 team representatives and scouts from the &lt;a href=\"NFL\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Football%20League\"&gt;CFL&lt;/a&gt; attended, including &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers'&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Tomlin\"&gt;Mike Tomlin&lt;/a&gt;.

He was ranked the 27th best wide receiver prospect by NFL.com and the 64th best wide receiver prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com.\nCleveland Browns.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Browns\"&gt;Cleveland Browns&lt;/a&gt; selected Benjamin in the fourth round (100th overall) of the &lt;a href=\"2012%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2012 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;.

Head coach &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Shurmur\"&gt;Pat Shurmur&lt;/a&gt; named him the fourth wide receiver behind &lt;a href=\"Mohamed%20Massaquoi\"&gt;Mohamed Massaquoi&lt;/a&gt;, Greg Little, and Josh Gordon.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Cleveland%20Browns%20season\"&gt;Cleveland Browns'&lt;/a&gt; season-opener against the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; and had one reception for 12-yards and a carry for 35-yards during their 17\u201316 loss. His first career reception came in the second quarter on a 12-yard pass by &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Weeden\"&gt;Brandon Weeden&lt;/a&gt;. The following week, he earned his first career start during the Browns' 34\u201327 loss at the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Cincinnati%20Bengals%20season\"&gt;Cincinnati Bengals&lt;/a&gt;.

The following week during a Week 4 matchup against the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Baltimore%20Ravens%20season\"&gt;Baltimore Ravens&lt;/a&gt;, Benjamin had the first punt return of his career for a 40-yard gain and had two kick returns for a total of 47-yards during a 23\u201316 loss. In Week 14, he returned a punt for a 93-yard touchdown to set a franchise record for longest punt return by a rookie in Cleveland's 30-7 routing of the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Kansas%20City%20Chiefs%20season\"&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt;. On December 16, 2012, Benjamin made a season-long 69-yard touchdown reception in the Browns' 38\u201321 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Washington%20Redskins%20season\"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt;.

He finished his rookie season with 18 receptions for 298 receiving yards and two touchdowns, while also carrying the ball six times for 66-yards. Benjamin was used sparingly as a returner with Josh Cribbs entrenched in the role and finished the season with three kick returns for 76-yards and three punt returns for 149-yards and a touchdown. Unfortunately, head coach &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Shurmur\"&gt;Pat Shurmur&lt;/a&gt; was fired after the Cleveland Browns finished last in the &lt;a href=\"AFC%20North\"&gt;AFC North&lt;/a&gt; with a 4\u201312 record.\n2013.\nHe entered an open competition for the vacant starting wide receiver role after the departure of &lt;a href=\"Mohamed%20Massaquoi\"&gt;Mohamed Massaquoi&lt;/a&gt;.

Head coach &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Chudzinski\"&gt;Rob Chudzinski&lt;/a&gt; named Benjamin the starting punt and kick returner after &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Cribbs\"&gt;Josh Cribbs&lt;/a&gt; departed in free agency.\nHe started the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Cleveland%20Browns%20season\"&gt;Cleveland Browns'&lt;/a&gt; season-opener against the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Miami%20Dolphins%20season\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; and caught three passes for 44-yards in their 23\u201310 loss.

He finished the season with five receptions for 105 receiving yards and had one carry for 45-yards in eight games and three starts. At the time of his injury, Benjamin was seventh in the league in punt return average. After a second consecutive 4\u201312 season, the Cleveland Browns fired head coach Rob Chudzinski after only one year.\n2014.\nHead coach &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Pettine\"&gt;Mike Pettine&lt;/a&gt; was hired by the Browns for the season and held an open competition for the starting wide receiver role after &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Gordon\"&gt;Josh Gordon&lt;/a&gt; was suspended in August. Benjamin competed with newly acquired free agents &lt;a href=\"Nate%20Burleson\"&gt;Nate Burleson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miles%20Austin\"&gt;Miles Austin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Hawkins\"&gt;Andrew Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;. He was named the third wide receiver and starting slot receiver behind Miles Austin and Andrew Hawkins.\nBenjamin played in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Cleveland%20Browns%20season\"&gt;Cleveland Browns'&lt;/a&gt; season-opener at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; and caught two passes for 20-yards and a touchdown during the 30\u201327 loss. His touchdown came in the fourth quarter on a nine-yard pass from quarterback &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Hoyer\"&gt;Brian Hoyer&lt;/a&gt; to tie the game 27-27 before Steelers' kicker &lt;a href=\"Shaun%20Suisham\"&gt;Shaun Suisham&lt;/a&gt; made a 47-yard field goal to win the game. On October 5, 2014, Benjamin made a season-high four receptions for 48-yards and caught two touchdown receptions during a 29\u201328 victory at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Tennessee%20Titans%20season\"&gt;Tennessee Titans&lt;/a&gt;. He caught a 17-yard touchdown and a six-yard touchdown pass from Brian Hoyer in the fourth quarter to help lead the Browns in a comeback victory. It was the first multi-touchdown game of his career. During a Week 15 matchup against the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Cincinnati%20Bengals%20season\"&gt;Cincinnati Bengals&lt;/a&gt;, Benjamin had two punt returns for 24-yards and made his first career tackle on Bengal's linebacker &lt;a href=\"Rey%20Maualuga\"&gt;Rey Maualuga&lt;/a&gt; after he intercepted a pass attempt by quarterback &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Manziel\"&gt;Johnny Manziel&lt;/a&gt;, intended for receiver &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20Gabriel\"&gt;Taylor Gabriel&lt;/a&gt;, and returned it 33-yards during the Browns 30\u20130 loss. He finished the season with 18 receptions for 314-yards and three touchdowns in 16 games and zero starts.\n2015.\nBenjamin received competition for the starting wide receiver job after the Browns signed longtime veterans &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Bowe\"&gt;Dwayne Bowe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Hartline\"&gt;Brian Hartline&lt;/a&gt; after Miles Austin departed in free agency and Josh Gordon received a second suspension for the full 2015 season. Head coach Mike Pettine surprisingly named Benjamin the starting wide receiver for the first time of his career, along with Andrew Hawkins, after he had a productive training camp where he was called the, \"most improved teammate\" by &lt;a href=\"Donte%20Whitner\"&gt;Donte Whitner&lt;/a&gt;. Although Bowe and Hartline were slated as the projected starters.\nHe started the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Cleveland%20Browns%20season\"&gt;Cleveland Browns'&lt;/a&gt; season-opener against the &lt;a href=\"2015%20New%20York%20Jets%20season\"&gt;New York Jets&lt;/a&gt; and made three receptions for 89-yards and a touchdown as they lost 31\u201310.

Benjamin was responsible for three of the Browns' touchdowns during the game, catching a 60-yard and 50-yard touchdown pass from Johnny Manziel and returning a punt return for a 78-yard touchdown in the second quarter and was named the &lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt; Special Teams Player of the Week. During a Week 3 matchup against the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Oakland%20Raiders%20season\"&gt;Oakland Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, Benjamin made four receptions for 45-yards and one touchdown in their 27\u201320 loss.

In Week 10, he made seven catches for 113-yards and caught his fifth touchdown reception of the season in a 30\u20139 loss at the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;. Benjamin would finish the season with career-highs of 68 receptions for 966 receiving yards and five touchdown receptions in 15 starts and 16 games. Unfortunately, the Cleveland Browns finished last in the AFC North for the fourth consecutive season with a 3\u201313 record and head coach &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Pettine\"&gt;Mike Pettine&lt;/a&gt; was fired after the season.\nAlthough the Cleveland Browns and Benjamin both were adamant about getting a new contract before the beginning of free agency and attempted to reach an agreement multiple times, discussions between both sides broke down and Benjamin entered the market.\nSan Diego / Los Angeles Chargers.\n2016.\nOn March 9, 2016, the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Chargers\"&gt;San Diego Chargers&lt;/a&gt;\nsigned Benjamin to a four-year, $24 million contract with $13 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $5 million.\nBenjamin entered training camp slated as one of the starting wide receivers with &lt;a href=\"Keenan%20Allen\"&gt;Keenan Allen&lt;/a&gt;.

On October 9, 2016, he had seven receptions for a season-high 117 receiving yards in the Chargers' 34\u201331 loss at the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Oakland%20Raiders%20season\"&gt;Oakland Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. He was unable to play in the Chargers Week 10 game against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Miami%20Dolphins%20season\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; after sustaining a knee injury. Benjamin finished the season with 47 catches for 677 receiving yards and four touchdowns in eight starts and 14 games.

He entered training camp facing stiff competition for one of the starting wide receiver jobs after the Chargers drafted &lt;a href=\"2016%20Clemson%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Clemson&lt;/a&gt; wide receiver &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Williams%20%28wide%20receiver%2C%20born%201994%29\"&gt;Mike Williams&lt;/a&gt; seventh overall.
