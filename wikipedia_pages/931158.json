    "text": "Power projection (or force projection or strength projection) is a term used in &lt;a href=\"international%20relations\"&gt;international relations&lt;/a&gt; to refer to the capacity of a &lt;a href=\"Sovereign%20state\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; to deploy and sustain forces outside its territory.\nThis ability is a crucial element of a state's &lt;a href=\"power%20in%20international%20relations\"&gt;power in international relations&lt;/a&gt;. Any state able to direct its military forces outside its territory might be said to have \"some\" level of power projection capability, but the term itself is used most frequently in reference to militaries with a worldwide reach (or at least significantly broader than a state's immediate area). Even states with sizable &lt;a href=\"hard%20power\"&gt;hard power&lt;/a&gt; assets (such as a large &lt;a href=\"standing%20army\"&gt;standing army&lt;/a&gt;) may only be able to exert limited &lt;a href=\"regional%20power\"&gt;regional influence&lt;/a&gt; so long as they lack the means of effectively projecting their power on a global scale. Generally, only a select few states are able to overcome the &lt;a href=\"military%20logistics\"&gt;logistical&lt;/a&gt; difficulties inherent in the &lt;a href=\"Military%20deployment\"&gt;deployment&lt;/a&gt; and direction of a modern, mechanized military force.\nWhile traditional measures of power projection typically focus on &lt;a href=\"hard%20power\"&gt;hard power&lt;/a&gt; assets (tanks, soldiers, &lt;a href=\"aircraft\"&gt;aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, naval vessels, etc.), the developing theory of &lt;a href=\"soft%20power\"&gt;soft power&lt;/a&gt; notes that power projection does not necessarily have to involve the active use of military forces in &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;. Assets for power projection can often serve dual uses, as the deployment of various countries' militaries during the &lt;a href=\"humanitarian%20response%20to%20the%202004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake\"&gt;humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake&lt;/a&gt; illustrates. The ability of a state to project its forces into an area may serve as an effective diplomatic lever, influencing the decision-making process and acting as a potential &lt;a href=\"deterrence%20theory\"&gt;deterrent&lt;/a&gt; on other states' behavior. In 2022 Russia's actions against Ukraine alerted Europe and its NATO partners to the threat to Europe's food and energy supply. After the 2008 war in Georgia, and the 2014 takeover of Crimea and Donbas in Ukraine, a political takeover of Ukraine is a likely objective of Russian leadership.\nHistory.\nEarly examples of power projection includes &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; dominance of Europe: the ability to project power is tied to the ability to innovate and field such innovations. Roman engineering innovations such as machines (&lt;a href=\"pile%20driver\"&gt;pile driver&lt;/a&gt;), concrete, aqueducts and modern roads provided the footing for an economic engine that powered a military that was unmatched in its day. Examples of Roman power projection include &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Caesar\"&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/a&gt; constructing the &lt;a href=\"Caesar%27s%20Rhine%20bridges\"&gt;Rhine bridge&lt;/a&gt; in 10 days to demonstrate the ability to march his 40,000 troops as he saw fit: the local inhabitants enjoyed the natural protection of the river and fled when this natural protection was overcome. Although Rome is far from the center of modern power, its influence can be seen in the architecture of modern capitols around the world (domes, arches, columns). The demonstration of an extraordinary innovative military capability will signal power and, when properly applied, terminate conflicts summarily.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Ming%20treasure%20voyages\"&gt;Ming treasure voyages&lt;/a&gt; in the 15th century, the Chinese treasure fleet was heavily militarized to exercise power projection around the Indian Ocean and thereby promote its interests.\nThe modern ability to project power and exert influence on a global scale can be tied to innovations stemming from the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and the associated modernizations in technology, communications, &lt;a href=\"finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bureaucracy\"&gt;bureaucracy&lt;/a&gt;; this finally allowed the state to create unprecedented amounts of wealth and to effectively marshal these resources to exert power over long distances.\nThe first such industrial-technological power was the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century. As a maritime power, its strength and ability to project power to further its interests lay in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;. A worldwide system of &lt;a href=\"naval%20base\"&gt;naval base&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"coaling%20station\"&gt;coaling station&lt;/a&gt;s, a large logistical bureaucracy to oversee shipbuilding, the supply of coal, food, water, and sailors, and an industrial base for the manufacture and technological enhancement of the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20fleet\"&gt;fleet&lt;/a&gt; were among the essential ingredients for this capability. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20Opium%20War\"&gt;First Opium War&lt;/a&gt; (1839\u201342), it was this capacity that enabled a British expeditionary force of 15 &lt;a href=\"barracks%20ship\"&gt;barracks ship&lt;/a&gt;s, 4 steam-powered &lt;a href=\"gunboats\"&gt;gunboats&lt;/a&gt; and 25 smaller boats with 4,000 marines to successfully defend its interests 6,000 miles from the fleet's home port. \nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;Anglo&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Second%20French%20Empire\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Expeditionary%20warfare\"&gt;expeditionary force&lt;/a&gt; sent to shore up the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; against Russian aggression during the &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20War\"&gt;Crimean War&lt;/a&gt; (1853\u201356) was one of the first examples of a planned expeditionary power-projection campaign. It was the first campaign to use modern technology, including steam-powered warships and &lt;a href=\"telegraph\"&gt;telegraph&lt;/a&gt; communications.\nAnother illustrative example of industrial power projection, was the &lt;a href=\"British%20Expedition%20to%20Abyssinia\"&gt;British Expedition to Abyssinia&lt;/a&gt; in 1868 as a retaliation against Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tewodros%20II%20of%20Ethiopia\"&gt;Tewodros II of Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;'s imprisonment of several missionaries and &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British government&lt;/a&gt; representatives. The expeditionary force sent was a tremendous logistical and technological challenge at the time. Commanded by Lieutenant-General &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Napier%2C%201st%20Baron%20Napier%20of%20Magdala\"&gt;Sir Robert Napier&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bombay%20Army\"&gt;Bombay Army&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"military%20intelligence\"&gt;military intelligence&lt;/a&gt; was used to estimate the required size of the army and the difficulties of traversing the inhospitable terrain.\nA force of over 30,000 was shipped from &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British India&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Zula\"&gt;Zula&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sea\"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt; on a fleet of more than 280 &lt;a href=\"Steamship\"&gt;steam ships&lt;/a&gt;, while an advance detachment of &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s built a large port with two piers, warehouses and a lighthouse, and constructed a 20-mile-long railway towards the interior. A road was also built for the artillery to be moved along with the help of &lt;a href=\"elephant\"&gt;elephant&lt;/a&gt;s. After three months of trekking, the British force repelled an Ethiopian attack and launched an artillery bombardment against the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Amba%20Mariam\"&gt;Magdala&lt;/a&gt; which led to its capitulation; Tewodros committed suicide.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Japanese%20War\"&gt;Russo-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt; of 1904\u201305, the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russian%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Russian Navy's&lt;/a&gt; Pacific Fleet demonstrated &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial Russia&lt;/a&gt;'s inability to project force in the &lt;a href=\"Far%20East\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt;. This immediately diminished Russia's diplomatic sway in that region. At the same time, Russia's western armies became less credible, as &lt;a href=\"mobilization\"&gt;mobilization&lt;/a&gt; exposed organizational flaws and threw the western armies into chaos. This led analysts in Europe, such as &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20staff%20%28military%29\"&gt;chief of staff&lt;/a&gt; Count &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20von%20Schlieffen\"&gt;Alfred von Schlieffen&lt;/a&gt;, to conclude that Russia would prove inept at projecting force in Europe, thus demoting Russia in European diplomatic relations.\nMany other actions can be considered projections of force. The 19th century is full of incidents such as the 1864 &lt;a href=\"Shimonoseki%20campaign\"&gt;Shimonoseki campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boxer%20Rebellion\"&gt;Boxer Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, the &lt;a href=\"Falklands%20War\"&gt;Falklands War&lt;/a&gt; provided an example of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s ability to project force far from home. Other recent examples of power projection include the U.S.-led &lt;a href=\"2003%20invasion%20of%20iraq\"&gt;invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"NATO%20bombing%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;NATO bombing of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. The ability of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;U.S. Navy&lt;/a&gt;, the British &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; to deploy large numbers of ships for long periods of time away from home are notable projection abilities.\nElements.\nThe &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Department%20of%20Defense\"&gt;U.S. Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; defines power projection as the \"ability of a nation to apply all or some of its elements of national power\u2014political, economic, informational, or military\u2014to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to deterrence, and to enhance regional stability\".\nAs distance between a fighting force and its headquarters increases, &lt;a href=\"Command%20and%20control%20%28military%29\"&gt;command and control&lt;/a&gt; inevitably becomes more difficult. Modern-day power projection often employs high-tech communications and &lt;a href=\"information%20technology\"&gt;information technology&lt;/a&gt; to overcome these difficulties, a process sometimes described as the \"&lt;a href=\"Revolution%20in%20Military%20Affairs\"&gt;Revolution in Military Affairs&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWhile a few long-range &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s such as the &lt;a href=\"intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile\"&gt;intercontinental ballistic missile&lt;/a&gt;s (ICBMs) and some &lt;a href=\"unmanned%20combat%20aerial%20vehicle\"&gt;unmanned combat aerial vehicle&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Drone%20strike\"&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt;) are capable of projecting deadly force in their own right, it is &lt;a href=\"military%20logistics\"&gt;military logistics&lt;/a&gt; that is at the heart of power projection. The ability to integrate &lt;a href=\"naval\"&gt;naval&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"air%20force\"&gt;air force&lt;/a&gt;s with land &lt;a href=\"army\"&gt;armies&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"joint%20warfare\"&gt;joint warfare&lt;/a&gt; is a key aspect of effective power projection; &lt;a href=\"airlift\"&gt;airlift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sealift\"&gt;sealift&lt;/a&gt; capabilities facilitate the deployment of &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s to a distant &lt;a href=\"theater%20%28warfare%29\"&gt;theater of war&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"carrier%20strike%20group\"&gt;aircraft carrier strike group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"strategic%20bomber\"&gt;strategic bomber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ballistic%20missile%20submarine\"&gt;ballistic missile submarine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"strategic%20airlift\"&gt;strategic airlift&lt;/a&gt;er are all examples of power projection platforms. Military units designed to be &lt;a href=\"Light%20infantry\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; and mobile, such as &lt;a href=\"airborne%20forces\"&gt;airborne forces&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"paratrooper\"&gt;paratrooper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"air%20assault\"&gt;air assault&lt;/a&gt; forces) and &lt;a href=\"amphibious%20assault\"&gt;amphibious assault&lt;/a&gt; forces, are utilized in power projection. &lt;a href=\"Forward%20basing\"&gt;Forward basing&lt;/a&gt; is another method of power projection, which, by pre-positioning military units or stockpiles of arms at strategically located &lt;a href=\"military%20base\"&gt;military base&lt;/a&gt;s outside a country's territory, reduces the time and distance needed to &lt;a href=\"mobilization\"&gt;mobilize&lt;/a&gt; them.\nTypes.\nScholars have disaggregated military power projection into nine different categories based on political goals and level of force. Four of these employ \"soft\" military power (securing &lt;a href=\"sea%20lane\"&gt;sea lane&lt;/a&gt;s of communication, &lt;a href=\"non-combatant\"&gt;non-combatant&lt;/a&gt; evacuation, &lt;a href=\"humanitarian\"&gt;humanitarian&lt;/a&gt; response, and &lt;a href=\"peacekeeping\"&gt;peacekeeping&lt;/a&gt;) and the rest are primarily concerned with \"hard\" military power (&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Ashow%20the%20flag\"&gt;show the flag&lt;/a&gt;, compellence/deterrence, punishment, armed intervention, and conquest).\nSoft power.\nExamples of soft power projection include:\nGray zone competition.\nThe gray zone between &lt;a href=\"Conflict_continuum\"&gt;cooperation and conflict&lt;/a&gt; has expanded due to the &lt;a href=\"Conflict_continuum%23Competition_continuum\"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt; between the power projection capabilities of the world's armies. \nThe US, Russia, China, Britain, and France have renounced the use of nuclear weapons in 2022, and going forward.\nThe &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; is investigating innovations, such as robots and drones, including 70 technologies funded by the \u00a3800 million (US$1 billion) Defence Innovation Fund launched in 2016. Two hundred troops will engage in \"surveillance, long-range, and precision targeting, enhanced mobility and the re-supply of forces, urban warfare and enhanced situational awareness\". The British Army is reducing size by about 10,000 troops as well, by 2025. The British Army will have Integrated Operating Concept (MDI\u2014like MDO) for \"gray zone\" operations across domains, using a synthetic operating environment, with repeatable hard and soft strike capability. The UK, Germany, and France respectively have established a joint command for space &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Space%20Command\"&gt;United Kingdom Space Command&lt;/a&gt;, a Space Situational Awareness Centre (Germany), and &lt;a href=\"French%20Space%20Command\"&gt;\"Commandement de l\u2019espace\"&lt;/a&gt; (France).\n\"By 2020 the Army's programs for modernization were now framed as a decades-long process of cooperation with allies and partners, for &lt;a href=\"Conflict%20continuum%23Competition%20continuum\"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt; with potential adversaries who historically have blurred the distinction between peace and war\"\u2014from: &lt;a href=\"Reorganization%20plan%20of%20United%20States%20Army\"&gt;Reorganization plan of United States Army&lt;/a&gt;\nHard power.\nExamples of hard power projection include:"
