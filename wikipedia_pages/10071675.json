    "text": "A civet () is a small, lean, mostly &lt;a href=\"nocturnal\"&gt;nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; mammal native to tropical Asia and Africa, especially the tropical forests. The term civet applies to over a dozen different species, mostly from the family &lt;a href=\"Viverridae\"&gt;Viverridae&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the species diversity is found in southeast Asia. The best-known species is the &lt;a href=\"African%20civet\"&gt;African civet&lt;/a&gt;, \"Civettictis civetta\", which historically has been the main species from which a &lt;a href=\"musk\"&gt;musk&lt;/a&gt;y scent used in perfumery, also referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"civet%20%28perfumery%29\"&gt;civet&lt;/a&gt;\", was obtained.\nTaxonomy.\nThe common name is used for a variety of &lt;a href=\"Carnivora\"&gt;carnivorous&lt;/a&gt; mammalian species, mostly of the &lt;a href=\"family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Viverridae\"&gt;Viverridae&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"African%20palm%20civet\"&gt;African palm civet&lt;/a&gt; (\"Nandinia binotata\") is genetically distinct and belongs in its own monotypic family, &lt;a href=\"Nandiniidae\"&gt;Nandiniidae&lt;/a&gt;.\nCivets are also called \"toddycats\" in English, \"Luwak\" in &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20language\"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt;,\"Mara Patti\" in &lt;a href=\"Malayalam%20language\"&gt;Malayalam&lt;/a&gt;, \"musang\" in &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20language\"&gt;Malaysian&lt;/a&gt;, and \"urul\u01e3v\u0101\" () in &lt;a href=\"Sinhala%20language\"&gt;Sinhalese&lt;/a&gt;. There can be confusion among speakers of Malaysian because the indigenous word \"musang\" has been mistakenly applied to &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es by printed media instead of \"rubah\", which is the correct but lesser-known term.\nA minority of writers use \"civet\" to refer only to \"&lt;a href=\"Civettictis\"&gt;Civettictis&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Viverra\"&gt;Viverra&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Viverricula\"&gt;Viverricula&lt;/a&gt;\" civets. But in more common usage in English, the name also covers \"&lt;a href=\"Chrotogale\"&gt;Chrotogale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cynogale\"&gt;Cynogale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diplogale\"&gt;Diplogale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hemigalus\"&gt;Hemigalus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arctogalidia\"&gt;Arctogalidia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Macrogalidia\"&gt;Macrogalidia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paguma\"&gt;Paguma&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Paradoxurus\"&gt;Paradoxurus&lt;/a&gt;\" civets.\nPhysical characteristics.\nCivets have a broadly cat-like general appearance, though the muzzle is extended and often pointed, rather like that of an &lt;a href=\"otter\"&gt;otter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mongoose\"&gt;mongoose&lt;/a&gt; or even possibly a &lt;a href=\"ferret\"&gt;ferret&lt;/a&gt;. They range in length from about (excluding their long tails) and in weight from about .\nThe civet produces a &lt;a href=\"musk\"&gt;musk&lt;/a&gt; (named &lt;a href=\"Civet%20%28perfumery%29\"&gt;civet&lt;/a&gt; after the animal) which is highly valued as a fragrance and stabilizing agent for perfume. Both male and female civets produce the strong-smelling secretion, which is produced by the civet's &lt;a href=\"perineum\"&gt;perineal&lt;/a&gt; glands. It is harvested by either killing the animal and removing the glands, or by scraping the secretions from the glands of a live animal. The latter is the preferred method today.\nAnimal rights groups, such as &lt;a href=\"World%20Animal%20Protection\"&gt;World Animal Protection&lt;/a&gt;, express concern that harvesting musk is cruel to animals. Between these ethical concerns and the availability of synthetic substitutes, the practice of raising civets for musk is dying out. &lt;a href=\"Chanel\"&gt;Chanel&lt;/a&gt;, maker of the popular perfume &lt;a href=\"Chanel%20No.%205\"&gt;Chanel No. 5&lt;/a&gt;, claims that natural civet has been replaced with a synthetic substitute since 1998.\nHabitat.\nViverrids are native to sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, southern China, South and Southeast Asia. Favoured habitats include woodland, savanna, and mountain &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;. In consequence, many are faced with severe loss of habitat; several species are considered vulnerable and the &lt;a href=\"otter%20civet\"&gt;otter civet&lt;/a&gt; is classified as endangered. Some species of civet are very rare and elusive and hardly anything is known about them, e.g., the &lt;a href=\"Hose%27s%20palm%20civet\"&gt;Hose's civet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Endemic%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Borneo%20montane%20rain%20forests\"&gt;montane forests&lt;/a&gt; of northern &lt;a href=\"Borneo\"&gt;Borneo&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the world's least known carnivores.\nSouth Asia.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20palm%20civet\"&gt;Asian palm civet&lt;/a&gt; species is known as \"uguduwa\" by the Sinhala-speaking community. The terms \"uguduwa\" and \"kalawedda\" are used interchangeably by the Sri Lankan community to refer to the same animal. However, the term kalawedda is mostly used to refer to another species in the civet family, the &lt;a href=\"small%20Indian%20civet\"&gt;small Indian civet&lt;/a&gt;.\nSri Lanka also has an endemic civet species called &lt;a href=\"golden%20palm%20civet\"&gt;golden palm civet&lt;/a&gt;. Recently this species was split into 3 separate endemic species as \"&lt;a href=\"Paradoxurus%20montanus\"&gt;Paradoxurus montanus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Paradoxurus%20aureus\"&gt;P. aureus&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Paradoxurus%20stenocephalus\"&gt;P. stenocephalus&lt;/a&gt;\". In Bangladesh and &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20language\"&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;-speaking areas of India, civets are known as \"khatash\" () for the smaller species and \"bagdash\" () for the larger ones and is now extremely rare in Bangladesh (in the &lt;a href=\"Khulna%20Division\"&gt;Khulna&lt;/a&gt; area of the country, the animal is also known as \"shairel\"). In Assamese this animal is known as \"zohamola\" (&lt;a href=\"Assamese%20language\"&gt;Assamese&lt;/a&gt;: \u099c\u09b9\u09be\u09ae\u09b2\u09be) which literally means \"to have &lt;a href=\"Joha%20rice\"&gt;zoha&lt;/a&gt; aromatic feces\". In Maharashtra &lt;a href=\"Marathi%20language\"&gt;marathi&lt;/a&gt;-speaking areas of India, civets are known as \"Udmanjar\" ().\nDiet.\nCivets are unusual among feliforms, and carnivora in general, in that they are &lt;a href=\"omnivores\"&gt;omnivores&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"herbivores\"&gt;herbivores&lt;/a&gt;. Many species primarily eat fruit. Some also use flower nectar as a major source of energy.\nCoffee.\n&lt;a href=\"Kopi%20luwak\"&gt;Kopi luwak&lt;/a&gt; (also called \"caphe cut chon\" (fox-dung coffee), in Vietnam, and \"kape alamid\", in the Philippines) is &lt;a href=\"coffee\"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; that is prepared using &lt;a href=\"Coffea\"&gt;coffee cherries&lt;/a&gt; that have been eaten and partly digested by the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20palm%20civet\"&gt;Asian palm civet&lt;/a&gt;, then harvested from its fecal matter. The civets digest the flesh of the coffee cherries but pass the pits (beans) inside, where stomach enzymes affect the beans, which adds to the coffee's prized aroma and flavor. can cost up to $600 in some parts of the world and about $100 a cup in others. This demand has led to civet farms on which the civets are fed a diet composed almost exclusively of such cherries, causing them to become severely malnourished. Farm conditions are also routinely described as deplorable. Filipino and Vietnamese oversight of these farms is non-existent.\nRelationship with humans.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Malay%20civet\"&gt;Malay civet&lt;/a&gt; is found in many habitats, including forests, secondary habitats, cultivated land, and the outskirts of villages, and is highly adaptable to human disturbances, including \"selective logging\" (partial forest removal).\nAfrican civets (\"Civettictis civetta)\" are listed as Least Concern, but in certain regions of Africa the population is declining due to hunting, direct and indirect poisoning, and an increase in large-scale farm fences that limit population flow. They are also seen as comparatively abundant options in the &lt;a href=\"bushmeat\"&gt;bushmeat&lt;/a&gt; trade.\n&lt;a href=\"Paradoxurinae\"&gt;Palm civets&lt;/a&gt; sold for meat in local markets of China's &lt;a href=\"Yunnan%20province\"&gt;Yunnan province&lt;/a&gt; carried the &lt;a href=\"SARS\"&gt;SARS&lt;/a&gt; virus from &lt;a href=\"horseshoe%20bats\"&gt;horseshoe bats&lt;/a&gt; to humans, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%932004%20SARS%20outbreak\"&gt;2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.\nUrban environments.\nPalm civets often venture into &lt;a href=\"urban%20area\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt;s, with people often complaining about civet faeces and the noise of the animals' climbing on roofs. Some studies have been undertaken to examine and mitigate such human\u2013animal conflict."
