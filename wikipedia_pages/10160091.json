    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, the spin representations are particular &lt;a href=\"projective%20representation\"&gt;projective representation&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"orthogonal%20group\"&gt;orthogonal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"special%20orthogonal%20group\"&gt;special orthogonal group&lt;/a&gt;s in arbitrary &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"metric%20signature\"&gt;signature&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., including &lt;a href=\"indefinite%20orthogonal%20group\"&gt;indefinite orthogonal group&lt;/a&gt;s). More precisely, they are &lt;a href=\"representation%20of%20a%20Lie%20group\"&gt;representations&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"spin%20group\"&gt;spin group&lt;/a&gt;s, which are &lt;a href=\"Double%20covering%20group\"&gt;double cover&lt;/a&gt;s of the special orthogonal groups. They are usually studied over the &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"complex%20number\"&gt;complex number&lt;/a&gt;s, but they can be defined over other &lt;a href=\"field%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;field&lt;/a&gt;s.\nElements of a spin representation are called &lt;a href=\"spinor\"&gt;spinor&lt;/a&gt;s. They play an important role in the &lt;a href=\"physics\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; description of &lt;a href=\"fermion\"&gt;fermion&lt;/a&gt;s such as the &lt;a href=\"electron\"&gt;electron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe spin representations may be constructed in several ways, but typically the construction involves (perhaps only implicitly) the choice of a maximal &lt;a href=\"isotropic%20subspace\"&gt;isotropic subspace&lt;/a&gt; in the vector representation of the group. Over the real numbers, this usually requires using a complexification of the vector representation. For this reason, it is convenient to define the spin representations over the complex numbers first, and derive &lt;a href=\"real%20representation\"&gt;real representation&lt;/a&gt;s by introducing &lt;a href=\"real%20structure\"&gt;real structure&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe properties of the spin representations depend, in a subtle way, on the dimension and signature of the orthogonal group. In particular, spin representations often admit &lt;a href=\"Invariant%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;invariant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bilinear%20form\"&gt;bilinear form&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be used to &lt;a href=\"Embedding\"&gt;embed&lt;/a&gt; the spin groups into &lt;a href=\"classical%20Lie%20group\"&gt;classical Lie group&lt;/a&gt;s. In low dimensions, these embeddings are &lt;a href=\"surjective\"&gt;surjective&lt;/a&gt; and determine special isomorphisms between the spin groups and more familiar Lie groups; this elucidates the properties of spinors in these dimensions.\nSet-up.\nLet be a &lt;a href=\"dimension%20%28vector%20space%29\"&gt;finite-dimensional&lt;/a&gt; real or complex &lt;a href=\"vector%20space\"&gt;vector space&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"nondegenerate%20form\"&gt;nondegenerate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quadratic%20form\"&gt;quadratic form&lt;/a&gt; . The (real or complex) &lt;a href=\"linear%20map\"&gt;linear map&lt;/a&gt;s preserving form the &lt;a href=\"orthogonal%20group\"&gt;orthogonal group&lt;/a&gt; . The &lt;a href=\"identity%20component\"&gt;identity component&lt;/a&gt; of the group is called the special orthogonal group . (For real with an indefinite quadratic form, this terminology is not standard: the special orthogonal group is usually defined to be a subgroup with two components in this case.) Up to &lt;a href=\"group%20isomorphism\"&gt;group isomorphism&lt;/a&gt;, has a unique &lt;a href=\"connected%20space\"&gt;connected&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Double%20covering%20group\"&gt;double cover&lt;/a&gt;, the spin group . There is thus a &lt;a href=\"group%20homomorphism\"&gt;group homomorphism&lt;/a&gt; whose &lt;a href=\"kernel%20%28group%20theory%29\"&gt;kernel&lt;/a&gt; has two elements denoted , where is the &lt;a href=\"identity%20element\"&gt;identity element&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the group elements and of are equivalent after the homomorphism to ; that is, for any in .\nThe groups and are all &lt;a href=\"Lie%20groups\"&gt;Lie groups&lt;/a&gt;, and for fixed they have the same &lt;a href=\"Lie%20algebra\"&gt;Lie algebra&lt;/a&gt;, . If is real, then is a real vector subspace of its &lt;a href=\"complexification\"&gt;complexification&lt;/a&gt; , and the quadratic form extends naturally to a quadratic form on . This embeds as a &lt;a href=\"subgroup\"&gt;subgroup&lt;/a&gt; of , and hence we may realise as a subgroup of . Furthermore, is the complexification of .\nIn the complex case, quadratic forms are determined uniquely up to isomorphism by the dimension of . Concretely, we may assume and\nThe corresponding Lie groups are denoted and their Lie algebra as .\nIn the real case, quadratic forms are determined up to isomorphism by a pair of nonnegative integers where is the dimension of , and is the &lt;a href=\"Sylvester%27s%20law%20of%20inertia\"&gt;signature&lt;/a&gt;. Concretely, we may assume and\nThe corresponding Lie groups and Lie algebra are denoted and . We write in place of to make the signature explicit.\nThe spin representations are, in a sense, the simplest &lt;a href=\"representation%20of%20a%20Lie%20group\"&gt;representation&lt;/a&gt;s of and that do not come from representations of and . A spin representation is, therefore, a real or complex vector space together with a group homomorphism from or to the &lt;a href=\"general%20linear%20group\"&gt;general linear group&lt;/a&gt; such that the element is \"not\" in the kernel of .\nIf is such a representation, then according to the relation between Lie groups and Lie algebras, it induces a &lt;a href=\"Lie%20algebra%20representation\"&gt;Lie algebra representation&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., a &lt;a href=\"Lie%20algebra%20homomorphism\"&gt;Lie algebra homomorphism&lt;/a&gt; from or to the Lie algebra of &lt;a href=\"linear%20map%23Endomorphisms%20and%20automorphisms\"&gt;endomorphisms&lt;/a&gt; of with the &lt;a href=\"commutator%23Ring%20theory\"&gt;commutator bracket&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpin representations can be analysed according to the following strategy: if is a real spin representation of , then its complexification is a complex spin representation of ; as a representation of , it therefore extends to a complex representation of . Proceeding in reverse, we therefore \"first\" construct complex spin representations of and , then restrict them to complex spin representations of and , then finally analyse possible reductions to real spin representations.\nComplex spin representations.\nLet with the standard quadratic form so that \nThe &lt;a href=\"symmetric%20bilinear%20form\"&gt;symmetric bilinear form&lt;/a&gt; on associated to by &lt;a href=\"Polarization%20identity%23Symmetric%20bilinear%20forms\"&gt;polarization&lt;/a&gt; is denoted .\nIsotropic subspaces and root systems.\nA standard construction of the spin representations of begins with a choice of a pair \nof maximal &lt;a href=\"isotropic%20quadratic%20form\"&gt;totally isotropic subspace&lt;/a&gt;s (with respect to ) of with . Let us make such a choice. If or , then and both have dimension . If , then , whereas if , then , where is the 1-dimensional orthogonal complement to . The bilinear form associated to induces a &lt;a href=\"bilinear%20map\"&gt;pairing&lt;/a&gt; between and , which must be nondegenerate, because and are totally isotropic subspaces and is nondegenerate. Hence and are &lt;a href=\"dual%20vector%20space\"&gt;dual vector space&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMore concretely, let be a basis for . Then there is a unique basis of such that\nIf is an matrix, then induces an endomorphism of with respect to this basis and the transpose induces a transformation of with\nfor all in and in . It follows that the endomorphism of , equal to on , on and zero on (if is odd), is skew,\nfor all in , and hence (see &lt;a href=\"classical%20group\"&gt;classical group&lt;/a&gt;) an element of .\nUsing the diagonal matrices in this construction defines a &lt;a href=\"Cartan%20subalgebra\"&gt;Cartan subalgebra&lt;/a&gt; of : the &lt;a href=\"rank%20of%20a%20Lie%20group\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; of is , and the diagonal matrices determine an -dimensional abelian subalgebra.\nLet be the basis of such that, for a diagonal matrix is the th diagonal entry of . Clearly this is a basis for . Since the bilinear form identifies with formula_7, explicitly,\nit is now easy to construct the &lt;a href=\"root%20system\"&gt;root system&lt;/a&gt; associated to . The &lt;a href=\"root%20space\"&gt;root space&lt;/a&gt;s (simultaneous eigenspaces for the action of ) are spanned by the following elements:\nand, if is odd, and is a nonzero element of ,\nThus, with respect to the basis , the roots are the vectors in that are permutations of\ntogether with the permutations of\nif is odd.\nA system of &lt;a href=\"positive%20root\"&gt;positive root&lt;/a&gt;s is given by and (for odd) . The corresponding &lt;a href=\"Simple%20root%20%28root%20system%29\"&gt;simple root&lt;/a&gt;s are\nThe positive roots are nonnegative integer linear combinations of the simple roots.\nSpin representations and their weights.\nOne construction of the spin representations of uses the &lt;a href=\"exterior%20algebra\"&gt;exterior algebra&lt;/a&gt;(s)\nThere is an action of on such that for any element in and any in the action is given by:\nwhere the second term is a contraction (&lt;a href=\"interior%20multiplication\"&gt;interior multiplication&lt;/a&gt;) defined using the bilinear form, which pairs and . This action respects the &lt;a href=\"Clifford%20relation\"&gt;Clifford relation&lt;/a&gt;s , and so induces a homomorphism from the &lt;a href=\"Clifford%20algebra\"&gt;Clifford algebra&lt;/a&gt; of to . A similar action can be defined on , so that both and are &lt;a href=\"Clifford%20module\"&gt;Clifford module&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Lie algebra is isomorphic to the complexified Lie algebra in via the mapping induced by the covering \nIt follows that both and are representations of . They are actually &lt;a href=\"isomorphism\"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; representations, so we focus on \"S\".\nThe explicit description shows that the elements of the Cartan subalgebra act on by\nA basis for is given by elements of the form\nfor and . These clearly span &lt;a href=\"Weight%20space%20%28representation%20theory%29\"&gt;weight spaces&lt;/a&gt; for the action of : has eigenvalue \u22121/2 on the given basis vector if for some , and has eigenvalue otherwise.\nIt follows that the &lt;a href=\"weight%20%28representation%20theory%29\"&gt;weights&lt;/a&gt; of are all possible combinations of\nand each &lt;a href=\"Weight%20space%20%28representation%20theory%29\"&gt;weight space&lt;/a&gt; is one-dimensional. Elements of are called &lt;a href=\"Dirac%20spinor\"&gt;Dirac spinor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen is even, is not an &lt;a href=\"irreducible%20representation\"&gt;irreducible representation&lt;/a&gt;: formula_29 and formula_30 are invariant subspaces. The weights divide into those with an even number of minus signs, and those with an odd number of minus signs. Both \"S\"+ and \"S\"\u2212 are irreducible representations of dimension 2\"m\"\u22121 whose elements are called &lt;a href=\"Weyl%20spinor\"&gt;Weyl spinor&lt;/a&gt;s. They are also known as chiral spin representations or half-spin representations. With respect to the positive root system above, the &lt;a href=\"highest%20weight\"&gt;highest weight&lt;/a&gt;s of \"S\"+ and \"S\"\u2212 are\nrespectively. The Clifford action identifies Cl\"n\"C with End(\"S\") and the &lt;a href=\"Clifford%20algebra%23Grading\"&gt;even subalgebra&lt;/a&gt; is identified with the endomorphisms preserving \"S\"+ and \"S\"\u2212. The other &lt;a href=\"Clifford%20module\"&gt;Clifford module&lt;/a&gt; \"S\"\u2032 is &lt;a href=\"isomorphism\"&gt;isomorphic&lt;/a&gt; to \"S\" in this case.\nWhen \"n\" is odd, \"S\" is an irreducible representation of so(\"n\",C) of dimension 2\"m\": the Clifford action of a unit vector \"u\" \u2208 \"U\" is given by \nand so elements of so(\"n\",C) of the form \"u\"\u2227\"w\" or \"u\"\u2227\"w\"\u2217 do not preserve the even and odd parts of the exterior algebra of \"W\". The highest weight of \"S\" is\nThe Clifford action is not faithful on \"S\": Cl\"n\"C can be identified with End(\"S\") \u2295 End(\"S\"\u2032), where \"u\" acts with the opposite sign on \"S\"\u2032. More precisely, the two representations are related by the &lt;a href=\"parity%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;parity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"involution%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;involution&lt;/a&gt; \"\u03b1\" of Cl\"n\"C (also known as the principal automorphism), which is the identity on the even subalgebra, and minus the identity on the odd part of Cl\"n\"C. In other words, there is a &lt;a href=\"linear%20isomorphism\"&gt;linear isomorphism&lt;/a&gt; from \"S\" to \"S\"\u2032, which identifies the action of \"A\" in Cl\"n\"C on \"S\" with the action of \"\u03b1\"(\"A\") on \"S\"\u2032.\nBilinear forms.\nif \"\u03bb\" is a weight of \"S\", so is \u2212\"\u03bb\". It follows that \"S\" is isomorphic to the &lt;a href=\"dual%20representation\"&gt;dual representation&lt;/a&gt; \"S\"\u2217.\nWhen \"n\" = 2\"m\" + 1 is odd, the isomorphism \"B\": \"S\" \u2192 \"S\"\u2217 is unique up to scale by &lt;a href=\"Schur%27s%20lemma\"&gt;Schur's lemma&lt;/a&gt;, since \"S\" is irreducible, and it defines a nondegenerate invariant bilinear form \"\u03b2\" on \"S\" via\nHere invariance means that\nfor all \"\u03be\" in so(\"n\",C) and \"\u03c6\", \"\u03c8\" in \"S\" \u2014 in other words the action of \"\u03be\" is skew with respect to \"\u03b2\". In fact, more is true: \"S\"\u2217 is a representation of the &lt;a href=\"opposite%20category\"&gt;opposite&lt;/a&gt; Clifford algebra, and therefore, since Cl\"n\"C only has two nontrivial &lt;a href=\"simple%20module\"&gt;simple module&lt;/a&gt;s \"S\" and \"S\"\u2032, related by the parity involution \"\u03b1\", there is an &lt;a href=\"antiautomorphism\"&gt;antiautomorphism&lt;/a&gt; \"\u03c4\" of Cl\"n\"C such that\nfor any \"A\" in Cl\"n\"C. In fact \"\u03c4\" is reversion (the antiautomorphism induced by the identity on \"V\") for \"m\" even, and conjugation (the antiautomorphism induced by minus the identity on \"V\") for \"m\" odd. These two antiautomorphisms are related by parity involution \"\u03b1\", which is the automorphism induced by minus the identity on \"V\". Both satisfy \"\u03c4\"(\"\u03be\") = \u2212\"\u03be\" for \"\u03be\" in so(\"n\",C).\nWhen \"n\" = 2\"m\", the situation depends more sensitively upon the parity of \"m\". For \"m\" even, a weight \"\u03bb\" has an even number of minus signs if and only if \u2212\"\u03bb\" does; it follows that there are separate isomorphisms \"B\"\u00b1: \"S\"\u00b1 \u2192 \"S\"\u00b1\u2217 of each half-spin representation with its dual, each determined uniquely up to scale. These may be combined into an isomorphism \"B\": \"S\" \u2192 \"S\"\u2217. For \"m\" odd, \"\u03bb\" is a weight of \"S\"+ if and only if \u2212\"\u03bb\" is a weight of \"S\"\u2212; thus there is an isomorphism from \"S\"+ to \"S\"\u2212\u2217, again unique up to scale, and its &lt;a href=\"Dual%20space%23Transpose%20of%20a%20linear%20map\"&gt;transpose&lt;/a&gt; provides an isomorphism from \"S\"\u2212 to \"S\"+\u2217. These may again be combined into an isomorphism \"B\": \"S\" \u2192 \"S\"\u2217.\nFor both \"m\" even and \"m\" odd, the freedom in the choice of \"B\" may be restricted to an overall scale by insisting that the bilinear form \"\u03b2\" corresponding to \"B\" satisfies (1), where \"\u03c4\" is a fixed antiautomorphism (either reversion or conjugation).\nSymmetry and the tensor square.\nThe symmetry properties of \"\u03b2\": \"S\" \u2297 \"S\" \u2192 C can be determined using Clifford algebras or representation theory. In fact much more can be said: the tensor square \"S\" \u2297 \"S\" must decompose into a direct sum of \"k\"-forms on \"V\" for various \"k\", because its weights are all elements in h\u2217 whose components belong to {\u22121,0,1}. Now &lt;a href=\"equivariant\"&gt;equivariant&lt;/a&gt; linear maps \"S\" \u2297 \"S\" \u2192 \u2227\"k\"\"V\"\u2217 correspond bijectively to invariant maps \u2227\"k\"\"V\" \u2297 \"S\" \u2297 \"S\" \u2192 C and nonzero such maps can be constructed via the inclusion of \u2227\"k\"\"V\" into the Clifford algebra. Furthermore, if \"\u03b2\"(\"\u03c6\",\"\u03c8\") = \"\u03b5\" \"\u03b2\"(\"\u03c8\",\"\u03c6\") and \"\u03c4\" has sign \"\u03b5\"\"k\" on \u2227\"k\"\"V\" then\nfor \"A\" in \u2227\"k\"\"V\".\nIf \"n\" = 2\"m\"+1 is odd then it follows from Schur's Lemma that\n(both sides have dimension 22\"m\" and the representations on the right are inequivalent). Because the symmetries are governed by an involution \"\u03c4\" that is either conjugation or reversion, the symmetry of the \u2227\"2j\"\"V\"\u2217 component alternates with \"j\". Elementary combinatorics gives\nand the sign determines which representations occur in S2\"S\" and which occur in \u22272\"S\". In particular\nfor \"v\" \u2208 \"V\" (which is isomorphic to \u22272\"m\"\"V\"), confirming that \"\u03c4\" is reversion for \"m\" even, and conjugation for \"m\" odd.\nIf \"n\" = 2\"m\" is even, then the analysis is more involved, but the result is a more refined decomposition: S2\"S\"\u00b1, \u22272\"S\"\u00b1 and \"S\"+ \u2297 \"S\"\u2212 can each be decomposed as a direct sum of \"k\"-forms (where for \"k\" = \"m\" there is a further decomposition into selfdual and antiselfdual \"m\"-forms).\nThe main outcome is a realisation of so(\"n\",C) as a subalgebra of a classical Lie algebra on \"S\", depending upon \"n\" modulo 8, according to the following table:\nFor \"n\" \u2264 6, these embeddings are isomorphisms (onto sl rather than gl for \"n\" = 6):\nReal representations.\nThe complex spin representations of so(\"n\",C) yield real representations \"S\" of so(\"p\",\"q\") by restricting the action to the real subalgebras. However, there are additional \"reality\" structures that are invariant under the action of the real Lie algebras. These come in three types.\nThe type of structure invariant under so(\"p\",\"q\") depends only on the signature \"p\" \u2212 \"q\" modulo 8, and is given by the following table.\nHere R, C and H denote real, hermitian and quaternionic structures respectively, and R + R and H + H indicate that the half-spin representations both admit real or quaternionic structures respectively.\nDescription and tables.\nTo complete the description of real representation, we must describe how these structures interact with the invariant bilinear forms. Since \"n\" = \"p\" + \"q\" \u2245 \"p\" \u2212 \"q\" mod 2, there are two cases: the dimension and signature are both even, and the dimension and signature are both odd.\nThe odd case is simpler, there is only one complex spin representation \"S\", and hermitian structures do not occur. Apart from the trivial case \"n\" = 1, \"S\" is always even-dimensional, say dim \"S\" = 2\"N\". The real forms of so(2\"N\",C) are so(\"K\",\"L\") with \"K\" + \"L\" = 2\"N\" and so\u2217(\"N\",H), while the real forms of sp(2\"N\",C) are sp(2\"N\",R) and sp(\"K\",\"L\") with \"K\" + \"L\" = \"N\". The presence of a Clifford action of \"V\" on \"S\" forces \"K\" = \"L\" in both cases unless \"pq\" = 0, in which case \"KL\"=0, which is denoted simply so(2\"N\") or sp(\"N\"). Hence the odd spin representations may be summarized in the following table.\n(\u2020) is even for and for , this is .\nThe even-dimensional case is similar. For , the complex half-spin representations are even-dimensional. We have additionally to deal with hermitian structures and the real forms of , which are , with , and . The resulting even spin representations are summarized as follows.\n(*) For , we have instead \n(\u2020) is even for and for (which includes with ), we have instead \nThe low-dimensional isomorphisms in the complex case have the following real forms.\nThe only special isomorphisms of real Lie algebras missing from this table are\nformula_48 and formula_49"
