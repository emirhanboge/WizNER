    "text": "Mynydd y Betws is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; or large hill located on the border between &lt;a href=\"Swansea\"&gt;Swansea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carmarthenshire\"&gt;Carmarthenshire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Wales\"&gt;South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, between &lt;a href=\"Ammanford\"&gt;Ammanford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clydach%2C%20Swansea\"&gt;Clydach&lt;/a&gt;. It is an area of upland with large stretches of tussocky grassland. The medieval castle of &lt;a href=\"Penlle%27r%20Castell\"&gt;Penlle'r Castell&lt;/a&gt; is located near the highest point and the Mynydd y Betws Wind Farm is prominent with fifteen wind turbines.\nGeography.\nAt , Mynydd y Betws is the highest mountain in the &lt;a href=\"Swansea\"&gt;City and County of Swansea&lt;/a&gt;, and the highest land between the &lt;a href=\"River%20Loughor\"&gt;River Loughor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Clydach%20River\"&gt;Upper Clydach River&lt;/a&gt;. A small road between &lt;a href=\"Ammanford\"&gt;Ammanford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clydach%2C%20Swansea\"&gt;Clydach&lt;/a&gt; passes very close to the summit, on which are located the historic ruins of &lt;a href=\"Penlle%27r%20Castell\"&gt;Penlle'r Castell&lt;/a&gt;. Little remains of this fort which was built to prevent armed marauders coming from the north and attacking Swansea. It was destroyed in 1252, not long after it was built.\nWind farm.\nMynydd y Betws is the site of a wind turbine farm. It was granted planning permission in 2009 and started producing electricity in 2013. The original developers of the site were the renewable energy generating company Eco2, but in 2010, they sold the site to the Irish semi-state electricity utility &lt;a href=\"ESB%20Customer%20Supply\"&gt;ESB&lt;/a&gt;. The mast of each turbine is tall and the blades are long. With fifteen turbines, the wind farm has an installed capacity of 34.5 MW and is said to generate enough electricity to power 23,800 households, one third of the domestic usage in Carmarthenshire. The Mynydd y Betws Wind Farm community benefit fund provides grants for projects in neighbouring areas of Carmarthenshire, Swansea and &lt;a href=\"Neath%20Port%20Talbot\"&gt;Neath Port Talbot&lt;/a&gt;. \nBetween July and September of 2017 the turbines did not produce any electricity, with the whole farm being put into a \"paused state\". This extensive outage was blamed on maintenance on the 132kV connection to the grid. "
