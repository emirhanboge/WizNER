    "text": "The Superior Mayor of Bogot\u00e1 (\"Alcalde Mayor de Bogot\u00e1\") is the highest administrative and police authority of the Special District of &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, and the head of the executive branch of the local government of Bogot\u00e1. The mayor heads the district's government alongside the distrital secretaries and the chiefs of the administrative departments.\nThe mayor is not the highest political authority of Bogota, distinction that belongs to &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1%20City%20Council\"&gt;District's City Council&lt;/a&gt; which is charged with creating municipal ordinances and overseeing the mayor's duties. The mayor is elected every four years by &lt;a href=\"Direct%20election\"&gt;popular vote&lt;/a&gt; and is usually considered by general opinion to be the second most important political post in &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; second only to the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;President of the Republic&lt;/a&gt;. The Superior Mayor of Bogota's Office oversees twenty local municipalities \"(localidades)\" which each have their own local Mayors.\nCurrent Mayor.\nThe current mayor is &lt;a href=\"Claudia%20L%C3%B3pez%20Hern%C3%A1ndez\"&gt;Claudia Nayibe Lopez Hernandez&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctions.\nThe Superior Mayor of Bogota is primarily tasked with executing the norms stipulated by the constitution, the law, and city ordinances approved by the City Council.\nAs the highest police authority of The District he is tasked with maintaining public order, being subordinated on this matter only to the President. In this way the District's Mayor Office is different from other municipalities in Colombia where the Mayor's are subordinated on this matter to the governors of the respective &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;departments&lt;/a&gt;. The Superior Mayor of Bogota has the same police authorities as all other Colombian mayors \"and\" governors within their respective jurisdictions such as elaborating police directives, commanding all police members assigned to the district, soliciting the help of the army during an &lt;a href=\"emergency\"&gt;emergency&lt;/a&gt;, ordering the demolition of buildings that pose a threat to public safety, regulating local commerce and the sell and distribution of liquor, amongst others.\nAs the supreme administrative authority and head of the local executive government he is charged with directing all &lt;a href=\"public%20works\"&gt;public works&lt;/a&gt;, as well supervising the continuous provision of all essential &lt;a href=\"public%20service\"&gt;public service&lt;/a&gt;s. As the judicial representative of the city, he and his delegates are competent to carry out contracts or agreements which are legally binding for the city itself.\nThe mayor also has normative prerogatives. He might create those &lt;a href=\"regulation\"&gt;regulation&lt;/a&gt;s, resolutions or orders he considers necessary to carry out &lt;a href=\"Local%20ordinance\"&gt;City Ordinances&lt;/a&gt;, mirroring the normative faculties the President has when it comes to implementing laws passed by &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs for his administrative duties he can freely appoint and remove the secretaries of the various secretariats that make up the superior mayor's office and the managers of the decentralized entities linked to his office. He may also do the same with all the functionaries of the central sector of the dependencies overseen by his office who are appointed to their post. He is tasked with overseeing the conduct of all the public servants under his authority and is competent to impose disciplinary sanctions after dues process to any of them.\nIn those dependencies that belong to the central sector and are ascribed to his office, he may freely create or eliminate posts, attribute said posts their functions, and decide the remuneration of those employees directly under his authority in accordance with the city's budget and in compliance with the law.\nEvery year he is tasked with presenting an inform of his administration to the City Council.\nDistrict administration.\nThe district administration of Bogota is headed by the superior mayor and is made up of various entities belonging to the central sector, the decentralized sector, and the local municipalities. Though the Bogot\u00e1 City Council forms part of the &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Branch%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;executive branch of the Colombian government&lt;/a&gt;, and is in charge of the administration of the city, it is not technically part of the district administration since it has no executive functions related to the administration of the city. Also the sub national oversight bodies that operate in Bogota such as the office of the Comptroller of Bogota and the ombudsman office of Bogota are not part of the Distrital Government and are completely independent from the mayor's office.\nThe Superior Mayor of Bogota, as the highest official within the district administration has various and ample prerogatives when it comes to the entities that make up the Central and decentralized sectors and the local municipalities. His influence is greater in those entities that make up the central sector, lesser in the decentralized entities, and limited in the local municipalities.\nCentralized and Decentralized entities.\nThe entities that make up the district administration are created by law or by city ordinances. It is through this entities that the mayor can execute his functions. Centralized entities do not have legal personality and are all under the direct responsibility of the superior mayor's office. Decentralized entities on the other hand are administratively autonomous and have judicial personality, nevertheless the &lt;a href=\"managers\"&gt;managers&lt;/a&gt; in charge of the decentralized entities as well as the majority of their respective &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20directors\"&gt;boards&lt;/a&gt; are appointed by the Mayor.\nCentralized Dependencies.\nThe Centralized entities that make up the central sector are:\nDecentralized Entities.\nDecentralized entities, as stated above are somewhat autonomous. Nevertheless, its top officials are appointed by the Superior Mayor's Office and thus tend to follow the same political lines as the city's administration. They have judicial personality which allows them to file lawsuits and be sued on their own responsibility. They have an independent budget which may not be modified by the Mayor once approved by the Council. Some of this centralized entities operate as part of the &lt;a href=\"public%20sector\"&gt;public sector&lt;/a&gt;, while others, called vinculated decentralized entities, operate as &lt;a href=\"State-owned%20enterprise\"&gt;private enterprises&lt;/a&gt; own or partly owned by the city's government. Each decentralized entity is ascribed(if it belongs to the public sector) or vinculated (if it operates as a private enterprise) to a centralized dependency. For instance the &lt;a href=\"Lottery%20of%20Bogota\"&gt;Lottery of Bogota&lt;/a&gt; (a private enterprise wholly owned by the City's Government) is vinculated to the Distrital Secretariat of the Treasury.\nLocal Mayors.\nLocal mayors are elected by the Local Administrative Councils out of a three candidate shortlist elaborated by the Superior Mayor."
