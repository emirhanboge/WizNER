    "text": "James L. Mitchell (29 September 1834 in &lt;a href=\"Shelby%20County%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Shelby County, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 22 February 1894) was an American lawyer, army officer and 11th mayor of the city of &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Indianapolis, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. Mitchell was born in &lt;a href=\"Kentucky\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; and settled in Indianapolis in 1859 where he &lt;a href=\"Reading%20law\"&gt;read law&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, Mitchell was an officer in the &lt;a href=\"70th%20Regiment%20Indiana%20Infantry\"&gt;70th Regiment Indiana Infantry&lt;/a&gt; and, near the end of the war, a &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; on the staff of General &lt;a href=\"Lovell%20Rousseau\"&gt;Lovell Rousseau&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to his law practice following the war and in 1873 became the first &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; mayor of Indianapolis since &lt;a href=\"Charles%20G.%20Coulon\"&gt;Charles G. Coulon&lt;/a&gt; twenty-seven years earlier. In fact from 1856 to 1890, Mitchell's two-year term (1873\u20131875) is the only one not served by a &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;."
