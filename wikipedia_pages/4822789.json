    "text": "Stanley Gene (born 11 May 1974) is a &lt;a href=\"Papua%20New%20Guinea\"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;n former &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; Kumul (#166) player and professional Assistant Coach (Defence) of the &lt;a href=\"Hull%20Kingston%20Rovers\"&gt;Hull Kingston Rovers&lt;/a&gt;. He previously coached &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20Thunder\"&gt;Gateshead Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and the academy team at &lt;a href=\"Hull%20Kingston%20Rovers\"&gt;Hull Kingston Rovers&lt;/a&gt; and served as the &lt;a href=\"Papua%20New%20Guinea%20Kumuls\"&gt;Papua New Guinea Kumuls&lt;/a&gt; head coach in 2010. Having moved to England following an impressive showing for PNG in the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1995 Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Gene enjoyed a long career in the British game with spells at &lt;a href=\"Hull%20Kingston%20Rovers\"&gt;Hull Kingston Rovers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Giants\"&gt;Huddersfield Giants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Bulls\"&gt;Bradford Bulls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halifax%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;.\nGene was a versatile player with the ability to cover virtually any position on the pitch, though he spent most of his test career playing at stand off (off-half). He was a regular for the PNG Kumuls for 14 years between 1994 and 2008, and captained the side on at least three occasions, including being the PNG captain during the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2008 Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, before retiring from international rugby league following the 2008 tournament. Gene is considered a hero in his home country and almost universally regarded as a rugby league legend.\nCareer.\nClub career.\nGene was born in &lt;a href=\"Goroka\"&gt;Goroka&lt;/a&gt;. After playing in the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1995 Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt; for Papua New Guinea, Gene was offered a contract to play for &lt;a href=\"Hull%20Kingston%20Rovers\"&gt;Hull Kingston Rovers&lt;/a&gt; in the old &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20League%20Championships\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt;. After moving to the United Kingdom, Gene played for Hull KR from 1996 to 2000. He scored 94 Tries in 111 matches during that period, and was a massively popular figure at the club. He moved to Gateshead and was then forced to play for rivals &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull F.C.&lt;/a&gt; when they merged. However, he had a frustrating time there, mainly featuring as a substitute. He was granted a release from his contract midway through 2001 and allowed to look for another club.\nGene signed with &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Giants\"&gt;Huddersfield Giants&lt;/a&gt; midway through 2001, but was unable to save them from relegation. However, he was instrumental in the club's unbeaten run and promotion back into Super League the following year. He went on to establish himself as one of Huddersfield's most important players.\nGene moved to the &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Bulls\"&gt;Bradford Bulls&lt;/a&gt; for the 2006 Season. Along with fellow Papua New Guinea national &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Bai\"&gt;Marcus Bai&lt;/a&gt;, Gene's first match for the club was their win the &lt;a href=\"2006%20World%20Club%20Challenge\"&gt;2006 World Club Challenge&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Wests%20Tigers\"&gt;Wests Tigers&lt;/a&gt;. He played from the interchange bench and scored a &lt;a href=\"try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; in the Bradford Bulls' 30-10 victory. After only one season with the Bradford Bulls, he was allowed to rejoin Hull Kingston Rovers.\nGene returned to Hull Kingston Rovers, his first English club, following their promotion to Super League in 2007. He provided experience and a steadying influence as the club established itself in Super League, before being allowed to leave at the end of the 2009 season.\nFollowing his release from Hull Kingston Rovers, Gene signed for &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20League%20Championships\"&gt;Cooperative Championship&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Halifax%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; for the 2010 season along with fellow countryman and close friend &lt;a href=\"Makali%20Aizue\"&gt;Makali Aizue&lt;/a&gt;.\nPNG.\nGene's representative career lasted over a decade. He made his test d\u00e9but for PNG against &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%20Robson%20Oval\"&gt;Lloyd Robson Oval&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Port%20Moresby\"&gt;Port Moresby&lt;/a&gt; during the France's tour of Oceania in 1994. Selected as a substitute for his first test, Gene contributed a field goal in PNG's 29-22 win.. He then went on to play for the Kumuls during the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1995 Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, and also played in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2008%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; World Cups. In addition, he represented his country in numerous test matches before announcing his intention to retire from international rugby league following the 2008 World Cup.\nFollowing PNG's exit from the tournament, he was tearfully carried from the field by his team mates and given a standing ovation by the 16,239 strong crowd at the &lt;a href=\"Dairy%20Farmers%20Stadium\"&gt;Dairy Farmers Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Townsville\"&gt;Townsville&lt;/a&gt;, Australia (his last game was a 46-6 defeat by the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Kangaroos\"&gt;Kangaroos&lt;/a&gt;). He is regarded in Papua New Guinea as a sporting legend.\nCoaching.\nIn 2010, &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Lam\"&gt;Adrian Lam&lt;/a&gt; stepped down as the coach of the PNG national team. Within a few days, it was announced that Gene would be installed as his replacement. The first game under Gene's leadership was the annual fixture between PNG and the Australian PM's XIII. Gene went on to coach the team for the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Four%20Nations\"&gt;2010 Four Nations&lt;/a&gt; in Australia and New Zealand, failing to register a victory over tournament winner &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Kiwis\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, runner up Australia, and &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn September 2013 Gene was appointed head coach of &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20Thunder\"&gt;Gateshead Thunder&lt;/a&gt; (now Newcastle Thunder) for the 2014 season.\nPersonal life.\nGene lives in Yorkshire , Gene has two sons, Elliott and Leo. In 2006, he paid for the installation of electricity in his home village of Segu, located on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Goroka\"&gt;Goroka&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012, he set up the Stanley Gene Foundation, aiming to supply donations to the deprived areas of Papua New Guinea.\nPronunciation of 'Gene'.\nThere has been confusion over the pronunciation of 'Gene'. \"When I first arrived in England people called me Gene (Jean) and I thought it sounded quite posh, so I got used to it, but it is Gene (Gennay), that's how it is pronounced back home.\"\nStanley Gene's age.\nStanley Gene's age was a major talking point about the player for many years. Although his date of birth registered with the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20League\"&gt;Rugby Football League&lt;/a&gt; (RFL) was 11 May 1974, many of his former team mates and coaches insisted he was considerably older than this.\nIn 2008, Gene himself stated that he was 34, and explained that some people believe that Papua New Guineans \"look older in the face\" than in other countries. Despite this explanation, it was rumoured that he was unable to provide a birth certificate to prove his age, and that he allegedly held several passports with different dates of birth. Former &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Warriors\"&gt;Wigan&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Fletcher%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Bryan Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; predicted that Gene could be as old as 45.\nOn 11 May 2013, Gene confirmed that it was his 39th birthday. He showed guests at his birthday dinner his birth certificate, which confirmed that his date of birth is 11 May 1974."
