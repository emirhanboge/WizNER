The award category was originally called Outstanding Host or Hostess in a Game or Audience Participation Show before changing to its current title in 1985. The awards ceremony was not aired on television in 1983 and 1984, having been criticized for voting integrity. The Emmy was named after an \"Immy\", an affectionate term used to refer to the image orthicon camera tube. The statuette was designed by &lt;a href=\"Louis%20McManus\"&gt;Louis McManus&lt;/a&gt;, who modeled the award after his wife, Dorothy. The Emmy statuette is fifteen inches tall from base to tip, weighing five pounds and is composed of iron, pewter, zinc and gold.\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 18 hosts.
