    "text": "The Mayan numeral system was the system to represent &lt;a href=\"number\"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"calendar%20date\"&gt;calendar date&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Maya%20civilization\"&gt;Maya civilization&lt;/a&gt;. It was a &lt;a href=\"vigesimal\"&gt;vigesimal&lt;/a&gt; (base-20) &lt;a href=\"positional%20notation\"&gt;positional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"numeral%20system\"&gt;numeral system&lt;/a&gt;. The numerals are made up of three symbols; &lt;a href=\"Zero%20number%23The%20Americas\"&gt;zero&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"turtle%20shell\"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"1%20%28number%29\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; (a dot) and &lt;a href=\"5%20%28number%29\"&gt;five&lt;/a&gt; (a bar). For example, thirteen is written as three dots in a horizontal row above two horizontal bars; sometimes it is also written as three vertical dots to the left of two vertical bars. With these three symbols, each of the twenty vigesimal digits could be written.\nNumbers after 19 were written vertically in powers of twenty. The Maya used powers of twenty, just as the &lt;a href=\"Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic%20numeral%20system\"&gt;Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system&lt;/a&gt; uses powers of tens. For example, thirty-three would be written as one dot, above three dots atop two bars. The first dot represents \"one twenty\" or \"1\u00d720\", which is added to three dots and two bars, or thirteen. Therefore, (1\u00d720) + 13 = 33. Upon reaching 202 or 400, another row is started (203 or 8000, then 204 or 160,000, and so on). The number 429 would be written as one dot above one dot above four dots and a bar, or (1\u00d7202) + (1\u00d7201) + 9 = 429.\nOther than the bar and dot notation, Maya numerals were sometimes illustrated by face type glyphs or pictures. The face glyph for a number represents the deity associated with the number. These face number glyphs were rarely used, and are mostly seen on some of the most elaborate monumental carvings.\nAddition and subtraction.\nAdding and subtracting numbers below 20 using Maya numerals is very simple.\n&lt;a href=\"Addition\"&gt;Addition&lt;/a&gt; is performed by combining the numeric symbols at each level:&lt;br&gt;\nIf five or more dots result from the combination, five dots are removed and replaced by a bar. If four or more bars result, four bars are removed and a dot is added to the next higher row.\nSimilarly with &lt;a href=\"subtraction\"&gt;subtraction&lt;/a&gt;, remove the elements of the &lt;a href=\"subtrahend\"&gt;subtrahend&lt;/a&gt; symbol from the &lt;a href=\"minuend\"&gt;minuend&lt;/a&gt; symbol:&lt;br&gt;\nIf there are not enough dots in a minuend position, a bar is replaced by five dots. If there are not enough bars, a dot is removed from the next higher minuend symbol in the column and four bars are added to the minuend symbol which is being worked on.\nModified vigesimal system in the Maya calendar.\nThe \"Long Count\" portion of the &lt;a href=\"Maya%20calendar\"&gt;Maya calendar&lt;/a&gt; uses a variation on the strictly vigesimal numbering. In the second position, only the digits up to 17 are used, and the &lt;a href=\"positional%20notation\"&gt;place value&lt;/a&gt; of the third position is not 20\u00d720 = 400, as would otherwise be expected, but 18\u00d720 = 360 so that one dot over two zeros signifies 360. Presumably, this is because 360 is roughly the number of days in a &lt;a href=\"year\"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;. (The Maya had however a quite accurate estimation of 365.2422 days for the &lt;a href=\"Solar%20Year\"&gt;solar year&lt;/a&gt; at least since the early &lt;a href=\"Maya%20civilization%23Classic%20period\"&gt;Classic era&lt;/a&gt;.) Subsequent positions use all twenty digits and the place values continue as 18\u00d720\u00d720 = 7,200 and 18\u00d720\u00d720\u00d720 = 144,000, etc.\nEvery known example of large numbers in the Maya system uses this 'modified vigesimal' system, with the third position representing multiples of 18\u00d720. It is reasonable to assume, but not proven by any evidence, that the normal system in use was a pure base-20 system.\nOrigins.\nSeveral Mesoamerican cultures used similar numerals and base-twenty systems and the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20Long%20Count%20calendar\"&gt;Mesoamerican Long Count calendar&lt;/a&gt; requiring the use of zero as a place-holder. The earliest long count date (on &lt;a href=\"Chiapa%20de%20Corzo%20Stela%202%23Notable%20finds\"&gt;Stela 2&lt;/a&gt; at Chiapa de Corzo, &lt;a href=\"Chiapas\"&gt;Chiapas&lt;/a&gt;) is from 36 BC.\nSince the eight earliest Long Count dates appear outside the Maya homeland, it is assumed that the use of zero and the Long Count calendar predated the Maya, and was possibly the invention of the &lt;a href=\"Olmec\"&gt;Olmec&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, many of the earliest Long Count dates were found within the Olmec heartland. However, the Olmec civilization had come to an end by the 4th century BC, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count dates\u2014which suggests that zero was \"not\" an Olmec discovery."
