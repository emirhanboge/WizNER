    "text": "Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur (), officially Hafnarfjar\u00f0arkaupsta\u00f0ur, is a port town and municipality in &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, located about south of &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;. The municipality consists of two non-contiguous areas in the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Region%20%28Iceland%29\"&gt;Capital Region&lt;/a&gt;, on the southwest coast of the country. At about 30,000 inhabitants, Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur is the third-most populous city in Iceland after Reykjav\u00edk and &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B3pavogur\"&gt;K\u00f3pavogur&lt;/a&gt;. It has established local industry and a variety of urban activities, with annual festival events.\nActivities.\nThe town is the site of an annual &lt;a href=\"Viking\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt; festival, where Viking culture enthusiasts from around the world display reconstructions of Viking garb, handicraft, sword-fighting and longbow shooting. It takes place in June each summer.\nLocal industry.\nJust two kilometres () outside of Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur is an &lt;a href=\"aluminium\"&gt;aluminium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"smelter\"&gt;smelter&lt;/a&gt;, run by &lt;a href=\"Alcan\"&gt;Alcan&lt;/a&gt;. The smelter was originally built in 1969, and it has improved its cleaning process since then, especially regarding &lt;a href=\"fluoride\"&gt;fluoride&lt;/a&gt;. Local elections were held in May 2006, where the people of the town voted against extension of the smelter.\nHistory.\nHafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur takes its name (meaning \"&lt;a href=\"harbour\"&gt;harbour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fjord\"&gt;fjord&lt;/a&gt;\") from the area's excellent natural harbour. The town is first named in the medieval &lt;a href=\"Landn%C3%A1mab%C3%B3k\"&gt;Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k&lt;/a&gt;, and the earliest reports of voyages to Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur date from the end of the 14th century. Englishmen began trading in Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in the 15th century, but German merchants followed in their wake and eventually drove the English out. In German documents, Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur was mentioned for the first time in 1391, and in another German document dating from 1486 the place was described as a trading place of merchants from &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. The town of Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur became an official member of the &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20League\"&gt;Hanseatic League&lt;/a&gt;. The first Lutheran church in Iceland was raised at H\u00e1igrandi, opposite \u00d3seyri, just outside the small boat harbour in 1533. After that, the &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20League\"&gt;Hanseatic traders&lt;/a&gt; prevailed in town until 1602, based at Hvaleyri. At this point, the Danish monarchy established a Danish trade monopoly in Iceland which lasted until late in the 18th century. During this period, Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur was the nation's busiest trade centre.\nIn 1793, Bjarni S\u00edvertsen settled here and became influential in local business and international trade, setting up a major commercial fishing operation. His enterprise and initiative signalled the start of impressive commerce in the town. Ever since, he has been called \"the father of Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur\" and nicknamed \"Sir Bjarni\". His house in Vesturgata street, built in 1803, was transformed into a museum (\"S\u00edvertsensh\u00fas\"). Around 1870, dramatic changes took place in Icelandic fishing. Residents followed the growing trend in Iceland of using decked boats rather than row-boats. This led to even more employment and rapid growth, and Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur was the fifth town in Iceland to attain official municipal status in 1908. The first mayor was P\u00e1ll Einarsson, who later became the mayor of &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;. The first road between Reykjav\u00edk and Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur was finished in 1898. The first hydrological power plant in Iceland was built in Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in 1904.\nIn 1890 Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur had 616 inhabitants and it was one of the largest towns in Iceland. When Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur attained official municipal status on 1 June 1908 it had 1 400 inhabitants. In 1920 Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur had 2 366 inhabitants, in 1940 3 686, in 1960 7 160 and in 1980 12 312. \nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Coot%20%28Trawler%29\"&gt;Coot&lt;/a&gt;\", Iceland's first trawler, operated from Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur between 1905 and 1908. Its boiler stands by the &lt;a href=\"roundabout\"&gt;roundabout&lt;/a&gt; on the junction of Reykjav\u00edkurvegur, Strandgata and Vesturgata. A harbour for large commercial ships was raised in 1912, and the first car arrived in 1913.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, more advanced &lt;a href=\"Commercial%20trawler\"&gt;trawlers&lt;/a&gt; and numerous motorised ships were added to the fleet. The town's first stern trawler appeared in 1973. Today, Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur is one of the nation's largest fishing centres and the site of Iceland's first fish &lt;a href=\"wholesale\"&gt;wholesale&lt;/a&gt;rs' auction market. Through the years, Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur's dynamic local economy has been strongly linked to fishing, although freight transport has recently become the major harbour activity. And now, the town is Iceland's second-ranked import and export harbour. Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur is the third largest town of Iceland, after Reykjav\u00edk and K\u00f3pavogur.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nThe climate in Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur is &lt;a href=\"subpolar%20oceanic%20climate\"&gt;subpolar oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; \"Cfc\").\nLocal festivals.\nBright days.\nEach year in May, the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20060920001721/http%3A//www.hafnarfjordur.is/menning%255Fog%255Fmannlif/bjartir%255Fdagar/\"&gt;Bright Days festival&lt;/a&gt; is held.
