    "text": "The Gezira Sporting Club (, &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20transliteration\"&gt;transliteration&lt;/a&gt;:\"n\u0101d\u012b al-\u01e7azyrah al-rey\u0101d\u012b\") is the largest multi-sport facility in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded in 1882 and was originally called Khedivial Sporting Club. It is located on the island of &lt;a href=\"Zamalek\"&gt;Zamalek&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe grounds of the Gezira Sporting Club were initially carved out of the \"Khedivial Botanical Gardens\", and as a result acacias and gardens continue to decorate the area. After the land had been formally leased to the &lt;a href=\"British%20military\"&gt;British military&lt;/a&gt; command in 1882, club rules were licensed and the land was divided into several recreational playing grounds. At first, the club was for the exclusive use of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembership was restricted to applicants elected by the committee, on the recommendation of two members, although &lt;a href=\"British%20army\"&gt;British army&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;officers&lt;/a&gt; were automatically enrolled. There were about 750 members. The entrance fee was &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Pound\"&gt;E\u00a3&lt;/a&gt; 2. The various subscriptions were as follows:\nGuests could visit the club whenever accompanied by those members by purchasing Day Passes for 50 &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20pound\"&gt;Egyptian pound&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1906, the club members asked the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20government\"&gt;Egyptian government&lt;/a&gt; for ownership, but their request was refused. Instead, they were granted a 60-year lease.\nThe exclusive character of the club continued until after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. In January 1952, the club was &lt;a href=\"nationalized\"&gt;nationalized&lt;/a&gt; and became a public club. By this point, most members of the Gezira Sporting Club were &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ians, but the club's members were from society's elite. As a result of nationalization, the ethos and structure of the club were to be altered during the &lt;a href=\"Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser\"&gt;Nasser regime&lt;/a&gt;. Half of its eighteen-hole &lt;a href=\"golf%20course\"&gt;golf course&lt;/a&gt; were given over to a youth club built by the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20government\"&gt;Egyptian government&lt;/a&gt; on the club premises (making it a nine-hole course). Much of what was deemed as a traditionally &lt;a href=\"Aristocracy%20%28class%29\"&gt;aristocratic&lt;/a&gt; asset was nationalized for the benefit of the poorer majority. These actions made the Egyptian president at the time, &lt;a href=\"Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser\"&gt;Gamal Abdel Nasser&lt;/a&gt;, loved and popular among the middle and lower classes of &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Anwar%20Al%20Sadat\"&gt;Anwar Al Sadat&lt;/a&gt;'s presidency, a new &lt;a href=\"elevated%20highway\"&gt;elevated highway&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"6th%20October%20Bridge\"&gt;6th October Bridge&lt;/a&gt;) was built over the remaining nine-hole golf course and six-furlong &lt;a href=\"Horse%20racing\"&gt;racecourse&lt;/a&gt; causing the size of the club to further erode.\nDespite suffering vandalism, the Gezira Sporting Club still offers most of the sports and games practiced by its founders: &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Squash%20%28sport%29\"&gt;squash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"croquet\"&gt;croquet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horse%20riding\"&gt;horse riding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat had started as a &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; military club evolved into one of &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt's&lt;/a&gt; greatest outdoor attractions. Over the next five decades Gezira Sporting Club remained both a landmark and one of &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo's&lt;/a&gt; greatest assets continuing to this day.\nAs of 2012, membership was estimated to consist of 43,000 families.\nGolf.\nThe 125-year-old par 70 &lt;a href=\"golf%20course\"&gt;golf course&lt;/a&gt; was the first in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, and was once its best. Before the &lt;a href=\"Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser\"&gt;Nasser Era&lt;/a&gt;, it was an 18-hole course used only by British nationals.\nTennis.\nSince 1907, Gezira Sporting Club has been the official home of Egypt's &lt;a href=\"lawn%20tennis\"&gt;lawn tennis&lt;/a&gt; with open tournaments and championships regularly held on its &lt;a href=\"clay%20court\"&gt;clay court&lt;/a&gt;s. From 1925, international celebrities took part in these widely attended events as it staged the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Open%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;International Championships of Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the launch of the Egyptian Lawn Tennis Association Championship in 1934, Gezira Sporting Club continued to offer its two cups:\nSwimming.\nThe Gezira swimming team was founded in the early 20th century. Now is one of the stronger swimming teams in the Egyptian Premier National Championships. It is ranked 13th out of 33 clubs.\nCurrent sports.\nThere are currently around forty sports played in Gezira Sporting Club. Some are:\nOther branch.\nLike other large clubs in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, the Gezira Sporting Club is currently in the process of building another branch. The planned location is in the &lt;a href=\"6th%20of%20October%20City\"&gt;6th of October City&lt;/a&gt;. The club had signed a contract for of land and construction has started."
