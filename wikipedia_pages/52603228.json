It was built in the middle of the second half of the twentieth century and is attached to the old and still preserved Franciscan mission, founded in the 17th century, in the then \"Paso del Norte\".\nThe first church of the area, still preserved, was erected by the order of the Franciscans who began to Christianize the natives. On December 8, 1659, Fray Garc\u00eda de San Francisco founded the Guadalupe de los Mansos Mission in the Paso del Norte river. The place took on importance since the capital of the province of New Mexico from 1681 to 1693 after the Pueblo Indian uprising of 1680.\nWith the growth of the city in the twentieth century at the initiative of Father Baudelio Pelayo the new cathedral was built attached to the old church. This was consecrated in the year 1941.\nCompleted the construction in the year of 1957, was designated the Diocese of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez."
