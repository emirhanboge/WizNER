    "text": "Italian orthography (writing) uses a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Latin%20alphabet\"&gt;Latin alphabet&lt;/a&gt; consisting of 21 letters to write the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian language&lt;/a&gt;. This article focuses on the writing of Standard Italian, based historically on the &lt;a href=\"Florentine%20dialect\"&gt;Florentine dialect&lt;/a&gt;.\nItalian orthography is very regular and has an almost one-to-one correspondence between letters or sequences of letters and sounds, that is, it is almost a &lt;a href=\"phonemic%20orthography\"&gt;phonemic orthography&lt;/a&gt;. The main exceptions are that &lt;a href=\"stress%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;stress placement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vowel%20quality\"&gt;vowel quality&lt;/a&gt; (for and ) are not notated, and may be voiced or not, and may represent vowels or semivowels, and a &lt;a href=\"silent%20letter\"&gt;silent&lt;/a&gt; is used in a very few cases.\nAlphabet.\nThe base alphabet consists of 21 letters: five vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and 16 consonants. The letters J, K, W, X and Y are not part of the proper alphabet, and appear only in loanwords (e.g. 'jeans', 'weekend'), foreign names, and in a handful of native words\u2014such as the names \"&lt;a href=\"Jesolo\"&gt;Jesolo&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Bettino%20Craxi\"&gt;Bettino Craxi&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Walter%20%28name%29\"&gt;Walter&lt;/a&gt;\", which all derive from &lt;a href=\"Languages%20of%20Italy\"&gt;regional languages&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, &lt;a href=\"grave%20accent\"&gt;grave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"acute%20accent\"&gt;acute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"circumflex\"&gt;circumflex&lt;/a&gt; accents may modify vowel letters.\nDouble consonants are &lt;a href=\"gemination\"&gt;geminated&lt;/a&gt;: \"fatto\" , \"palla\" , \"bevve\" etc.\nVowels.\nThe Italian alphabet has five &lt;a href=\"vowel\"&gt;vowel&lt;/a&gt; letters, . Of those, only represents one &lt;a href=\"speech%20sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt; value, while all others have two. In addition, and indicate a different pronunciation of a preceding or (see below).\nIn &lt;a href=\"stress%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;stressed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"syllable\"&gt;syllable&lt;/a&gt;s, represents both &lt;a href=\"open-mid%20vowel\"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"close-mid%20vowel\"&gt;close&lt;/a&gt; . Similarly, represents both open and close (see &lt;a href=\"Italian%20phonology\"&gt;Italian phonology&lt;/a&gt; for further details on those sounds). There is typically no &lt;a href=\"orthography\"&gt;orthographic&lt;/a&gt; distinction between the open and close sounds represented, though &lt;a href=\"accent%20mark\"&gt;accent mark&lt;/a&gt;s are used in certain instances (see &lt;a href=\"%23Diacritics\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). There are some &lt;a href=\"minimal%20pair\"&gt;minimal pair&lt;/a&gt;s, called &lt;a href=\"heteronym%20%28linguistics%29%23Italian\"&gt;heteronyms&lt;/a&gt;, where the same spelling is used for distinct words with distinct vowel sounds. In unstressed syllables, only the close variants occur.\nIn addition to representing the respective vowels and , and also typically represent the &lt;a href=\"semivowel\"&gt;semivowel&lt;/a&gt;s and , respectively, when unstressed and occurring before another vowel. Many exceptions exist (e.g. , , , , , , , , , , , ). An may indicate that a preceding or is 'soft' ().\nC and G.\nThe letters and represent the &lt;a href=\"plosive\"&gt;plosive&lt;/a&gt;s and before and before the vowels , , . They represent the &lt;a href=\"affricate\"&gt;affricate&lt;/a&gt;s and respectively when they precede a front vowel ( or ).\nThe letter can also function within &lt;a href=\"digraph%20%28orthography%29\"&gt;digraph&lt;/a&gt;s (two letters representing one sound) and to indicate \"soft\" (affricate) or before another vowel. In these instances, the vowel following the digraph is stressed, and represents no vowel sound: \"ci\u00f2\" (), \"gi\u00f9\" (). An item such as \"CIA\" '&lt;a href=\"CIA\"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;', pronounced with stressed, contains no digraph. \nFor words of more than one syllable, stress position must be known in order to distinguish between digraph or containing no actual phonological vowel and sequences of affricate and stressed . For example, the words \"camicia\" \"shirt\" and \"farmacia\" \"pharmacy\" share the spelling , but contrast in that only the first is stressed in \"camicia\", thus represents with no sound (likewise, \"grigio\" ends in and the names \"Gianni\" and \"Gianna\" contain only two actual vowels: , ). In \"farmacia\" is stressed, so that is not a digraph, but represents two of the three constituents of . \nWhen the \"hard\" (plosive) pronunciation or occurs before a front vowel or , digraphs and are used, so that represents or and represents or . The same principle applies to : and represent or and or .\nIn the evolution from &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; to Italian, the postalveolar affricates and were &lt;a href=\"allophone\"&gt;contextual variants&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"velar%20consonant\"&gt;velar consonant&lt;/a&gt;s and . They eventually came to be full &lt;a href=\"phoneme\"&gt;phoneme&lt;/a&gt;s, and orthographic adjustments were introduced to distinguish them. The phonemicity of the affricates can be demonstrated with &lt;a href=\"minimal%20pair\"&gt;minimal pair&lt;/a&gt;s:\nThe trigraphs and are used to indicate &lt;a href=\"geminate\"&gt;geminate&lt;/a&gt; and , respectively, when they occur before or ; e.g. 'eyes', 'to dress up'.\n joins with to form a digraph representing palatal before , and with to represent with any vowel following. Between vowels these are pronounced phonetically long, as in \"aglio\" 'garlic', \"ogni\" 'each'. By way of exception, before represents in some words derived from Greek, such as 'wisteria', and in a few adaptations from other languages such as \"&lt;a href=\"glissando\"&gt;glissando&lt;/a&gt;\" [\u0261lis\u02c8sando], partially Italianized from French \"glissant\". before vowels other than represents straightforward . \nThe &lt;a href=\"digraph%20%28orthography%29\"&gt;digraph&lt;/a&gt; is used before and to represent ; before other vowels, is used for . Otherwise, represents , the of which follows the normal orthographic rules explained above.\n&lt;a href=\"Intervocalic%20consonant\"&gt;Intervocalic&lt;/a&gt; , , and are always &lt;a href=\"gemination\"&gt;geminated&lt;/a&gt; and no orthographic distinction is made to indicate this.\nC and Q.\nNormally is represented by , but it is represented by in some words, such as , , , , and . These words all contain a sequence derived from an original which was subsequently &lt;a href=\"diphthongization\"&gt;diphthongized&lt;/a&gt;. The sequence is always spelled (e.g. ), with exceptions being spelled in the words , its derivation , and and , two alternative forms of .\nS and Z.\n and are ambiguous to &lt;a href=\"voice%20%28phonetics%29\"&gt;voicing&lt;/a&gt;.\n represents a &lt;a href=\"dental%20consonant\"&gt;dental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sibilant%20consonant\"&gt;sibilant consonant&lt;/a&gt;, either or . However, these two phonemes are in &lt;a href=\"complementary%20distribution\"&gt;complementary distribution&lt;/a&gt; everywhere except between two vowels in the same word and, even with such words, there are very few &lt;a href=\"minimal%20pair\"&gt;minimal pair&lt;/a&gt;s.\n always represents voiceless : , , , etc.\n represents a &lt;a href=\"dental%20consonant\"&gt;dental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"affricate%20consonant\"&gt;affricate consonant&lt;/a&gt;; either ( ) or ( ), depending on context, though there are few minimal pairs.\nBetween vowels and/or semivowels ( and ), is pronounced as if doubled ( or , e.g. , ). Generally, intervocalic \"z\" is written doubled, but it is written single in most words where it precedes two vowels and in some learn\u00e8d words.\n may represent either a voiceless alveolar affricate or its voiced counterpart : voiceless in e.g. , , , , voiced in , , , , , . Most words are consistently pronounced with or throughout Italy in the standard language (e.g. 'magpie', 'race, breed'), but a few words, such as 'breeze', 'effervesce, sting' exist in both voiced and voiceless forms, differing by &lt;a href=\"Register%20%28sociolinguistics%29\"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; or by geographic area. The verbal ending \"-izzare\" from Greek -\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd is always pronounced (e.g. ), maintained in both &lt;a href=\"Inflection\"&gt;inflected&lt;/a&gt; forms and &lt;a href=\"Morphological%20derivation\"&gt;derivations&lt;/a&gt;: 'I organize', 'organization'. Like above, however, not all verbs ending in -\"izzare\" continue &lt;a href=\"suffix\"&gt;suffix&lt;/a&gt;ed Greek -\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), having instead -\"izz\"- as part of the &lt;a href=\"verb%20stem\"&gt;verb stem&lt;/a&gt;. , for example, of Latin origin reconstructed as *, has /tts/ in all forms containing the root \"indirizz\"-.\nSilent H.\nIn addition to being used to indicate a hard or before front vowels (see above), is used to distinguish , , , (&lt;a href=\"present%20indicative\"&gt;present indicative&lt;/a&gt; of , 'to have') from ('or'), ('to the', m. pl.), ('to'), ('year'); since is always silent, there is no difference in the pronunciation of such words. The letter is also used in some interjections, where it always comes immediately after the first vowel in the word (e.g. , , , ), as well as in some loanwords (e.g. ). In &lt;a href=\"filler%20words\"&gt;filler words&lt;/a&gt; and both \u27e8h\u27e9 and the preceding vowel are silent.\nJ, K, W, X and Y.\nThe letters J (\"I lunga\" 'long I'), K (\"cappa\"), W (\"V doppia\" or \"doppia V\" 'double V'), X (\"ics\") and Y (\"ipsilon\" or \"I greca\" 'Greek I') are used only in loanwords, proper names and archaisms, with few exceptions. \nIn modern standard &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; spelling, the letter is used only in &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; words, proper nouns (such as &lt;a href=\"Jesi\"&gt;Jesi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Letojanni\"&gt;Letojanni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juventus\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt; etc.) and words borrowed from foreign languages. Until the 19th century, was used instead of in &lt;a href=\"diphthong\"&gt;diphthong&lt;/a&gt;s, as a replacement for final \"-ii\", and in vowel groups (as in \"Savoja\"); this rule was quite strict in official writing. is also used to render in dialectal spelling, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Romanesco%20dialect\"&gt;Romanesco dialect&lt;/a&gt; \"ajo\" (\"garlic\"; cf. Italian \"aglio\" ).\nThe letter is not in the standard alphabet and exists only in unassimilated loanwords, although it is often used informally among young people as a replacement for , paralleling the use of in English (for example, \"ke\" instead of \"che\").\nAlso is only used in loanwords, mainly of Germanic origin. A capital \"W\" is used as an abbreviation of \"viva\" or \"evviva\" (\"long live\").\nIn Italian, is either pronounced , as in \"extra\", \"uxorio\", \"xilofono\", or , as \"exoterico\", when it is preceded by and followed by a vowel. In several related languages, notably &lt;a href=\"Venetian%20language\"&gt;Venetian&lt;/a&gt;, it represents the voiced sibilant . It is also used, mainly amongst the young people, as a short written form for \"per\", meaning \"for\" (for example \"x sempre\", meaning \"forever\"): this is because in Italian the &lt;a href=\"%C3%97\"&gt;multiplication sign&lt;/a&gt; (similar to ) is called \"per\". However, is found only in &lt;a href=\"loanword\"&gt;loanword&lt;/a&gt;s, as it is not part of the standard Italian alphabet; in most words with , this letter may be replaced with 's' or 'ss' (with different pronunciation: \"xilofono/silofono\", \"taxi/tass\u00ec\") or, rarely, by 'cs' (with the same pronunciation: \"claxon/\").\nDiacritics.\nThe &lt;a href=\"acute%20accent\"&gt;acute accent&lt;/a&gt; (\u00b4) may be used on and to represent &lt;a href=\"close-mid%20vowel\"&gt;close-mid vowel&lt;/a&gt;s when they are &lt;a href=\"stress%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;stressed&lt;/a&gt; in a position other than the default &lt;a href=\"penult\"&gt;second-to-last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"syllable\"&gt;syllable&lt;/a&gt;. This use of accents is generally mandatory only to indicate stress on a word-final vowel; elsewhere, accents are generally found only in dictionaries. Since final is hardly ever close-mid, is very rarely encountered in written Italian (e.g. 'subway', from the original French pronunciation of with a final-stressed ). \nThe &lt;a href=\"grave%20accent\"&gt;grave accent&lt;/a&gt; (`) is found on , , , , . It may be used on and when they represent &lt;a href=\"open-mid%20vowel\"&gt;open-mid vowel&lt;/a&gt;s. The accents may also be used to differentiate &lt;a href=\"minimal%20pair\"&gt;minimal pair&lt;/a&gt;s within Italian (for example 'peach' vs. 'fishing'), but in practice this is limited to didactic texts. In the case of final and , both possibilities are encountered. By far the most common option is the grave accent, and , though this may be due to the rarity of the acute accent to represent stress; the alternative of employing the acute, and , is in practice limited to erudite texts, but can be justified as both vowels are high (as in &lt;a href=\"Catalan%20orthography\"&gt;Catalan&lt;/a&gt;). However, since there are no corresponding low (or lax) vowels to contrast with in Italian, both choices are equally acceptable.\nThe &lt;a href=\"circumflex%20accent\"&gt;circumflex accent&lt;/a&gt; (^) can be used to mark the &lt;a href=\"contraction%20%28grammar%29\"&gt;contraction&lt;/a&gt; of two vowels, especially a double, final may become . For example, it can be used to differentiate words like ('genes', plural of ) and ('geniuses', plural of ). This is especially seen in older texts, since two &lt;a href=\"homophone\"&gt;homophone&lt;/a&gt;s are usually distinguished by the context. Current use usually prefers a single instead of a double or a with circumflex.\nMonosyllabic words generally lack an accent (e.g. , ). The accent is written, however, if there is an or a preceding another vowel (, ). This applies even if the is \"silent\", i.e. part of the digraphs or representing /t\u0283/ and /d\u0292/ (, ). It does not apply, however, if the word begins with (, ). Many monosyllabic words are spelled with an accent in order to avoid ambiguity with other words (e.g. , versus , ). This is known as \"accento distintivo\" and also occurs in other Romance languages (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20orthography\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; \"tilde diacr\u00edtica\")."
