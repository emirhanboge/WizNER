    "text": "The Trust Territory of Somaliland, officially the \"Trust Territory of Somaliland under Italian administration\" (), was a &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Trust%20Territories\"&gt;United Nations Trust Territory&lt;/a&gt; situated in present-day &lt;a href=\"Somalia\"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;. Its capital was &lt;a href=\"Mogadishu\"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt; and was administered by &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; from 1950 to 1960, following the dissolution of the former &lt;a href=\"British%20Military%20Administration%20%28Somalia%29\"&gt;British Military Administration&lt;/a&gt;. The Trust Territory was very poorly prepared for &lt;a href=\"Somalia%23Independence%20%281960%E2%80%931969%29\"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt; because Italy was financially unable to handle its role, and because it imposed a Western political model that did not fit the needs of Somalia. After 1990, Somalia &lt;a href=\"Somali%20Civil%20War\"&gt;collapsed into violence and chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn 1941, &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Somaliland\"&gt;Italian Somaliland&lt;/a&gt; was occupied by British and South African troops as part of the &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;East African Campaign&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The British continued to administer the area until 1 April 1950. On that date, Italian Somaliland was made a &lt;a href=\"Trust%20Territory\"&gt;Trust Territory&lt;/a&gt;, as stipulated by &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; General Assembly Resolution 289 of 21 November 1949. This was the only case of a trusteeship being assigned to a defeated Second World War power.\n&lt;a href=\"Indro%20Montanelli\"&gt;Indro Montanelli&lt;/a&gt;, a defender of Italian colonial rule, wrote in the late 1990s (when Somalia was devastated by civil war) that the ten years of Italian Trusteeship were the \"Golden age\" of Somalia: the population nearly doubled, illiteracy was reduced by 60%, malnutrition in the rural areas disappeared, the economy soared to the same level of the most developed African countries and there was complete integration in religious and social-political matters between all Somalia inhabitants.\nThe conditional return of the Italian administration to southern Somalia gave the new trust territory several unique advantages compared with other African colonies. To the extent that Italy held the territory by &lt;a href=\"UN%20Mandate\"&gt;UN mandate&lt;/a&gt;, the trusteeship provisions gave the Somalis the opportunity to gain experience in political education and self-government. These were advantages that British Somaliland, which was to be incorporated into the new Somali state, did not have. Although in the 1950s British colonial officials attempted, through various development efforts, to make up for past neglect, the protectorate stagnated. The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would cause serious difficulties when it came time to integrate the two parts.\nIn 1954, the Italian government established post-secondary institutions of law, economics, and social studies in &lt;a href=\"Mogadishu\"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt;, the territory's capital. These institutions were satellites of the &lt;a href=\"Sapienza%20University%20of%20Rome\"&gt;University of Rome&lt;/a&gt;, which provided all the instruction material, faculty and administration.\nIn 1960, the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Somaliland\"&gt;Italian Somaliland&lt;/a&gt;) became independent, following in the footsteps of the briefly extant &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Somaliland\"&gt;State of Somaliland&lt;/a&gt; (the former &lt;a href=\"British%20Somaliland\"&gt;British Somaliland&lt;/a&gt;) which had gained independence five days earlier, with &lt;a href=\"Mohamed%20Haji%20Ibrahim%20Egal\"&gt;Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal&lt;/a&gt; as Prime Minister on June 26, 1960. On July 1, 1960, the two territories &lt;a href=\"political%20union\"&gt;united&lt;/a&gt; as planned to form the &lt;a href=\"Somali%20Republic\"&gt;Somali Republic&lt;/a&gt;. A new government was formed with &lt;a href=\"Haji%20Bashir%20Ismail%20Yusuf\"&gt;Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf&lt;/a&gt; as the first President of the Somali National Assembly, &lt;a href=\"Abdullahi%20Issa\"&gt;Abdullahi Issa&lt;/a&gt; as Prime Minister, &lt;a href=\"Aden%20Abdullah%20Osman%20Daar\"&gt;Aden Abdullah Osman Daar&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Somalia\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abdirashid%20Ali%20Shermarke\"&gt;Abdirashid Ali Shermarke&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Somalia\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, later to become President (from 1967 to 1969). On June 20, 1961, through a popular &lt;a href=\"Somali%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%201961\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt;, the Somali people ratified a new &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Somalia\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; first drafted in 1960.\nOrganization.\nAn Administrator, chosen from among career diplomats, represented the Italian Government. He, by decree of the Italian President, also held the functions of Commander of the Armed Forces in Somalia, made up of a Military Corps and a Police Corps: the &lt;a href=\"AFIS%20Security%20Corps\"&gt;AFIS Security Corps&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Somalia%20Carabinieri%20Group\"&gt;Somalia Carabinieri Group&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe AMI set up the Somalia Air Force Command [8] with a Flight Group that included, in addition to transport and connection aircraft Douglas C-47, Douglas C-53 and Stinson L-5 Sentinel, also a fighter squadron equipped of P-51 Mustang (MM.4237, MM.4239, MM.4250, MM.4259) ex 4th Wing. The only intervention that saw the Somali Air Command Mustang in action was a strafing to disperse a group of armed Somalis near &lt;a href=\"Vittorio%20di%20Africa\"&gt;Vittorio d'Africa&lt;/a&gt;. In 1962 eight ex-AMI F-51Ds then formed the first fighter squadron of the Somali Air Force.\nIn 1956 there was a reorganization, with the creation of the Somali Army and the Somali Police Forces, where the former Zapti\u00e9 who had fought alongside the Italians were also admitted [9].\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe territory was divided into six \"Commissariats\", later called \"Regions\", headed by a Commissioner and since 1956 a Prefect. The Commissariats were further divided into \"Residences\", headed by a military or civilian resident [10]. The Administrator had also been entrusted with the legislative power pending the constitution of the Legislative Assembly, which was elected in 1956, with also a Somali executive for internal affairs [11] headed by Abdullahi Issa Mohamud.\nLanguage.\n&lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; was an official language in Italian Somaliland during the Fiduciary Mandate, as well as during the first years of independence. &lt;a href=\"Somali%20language\"&gt;Somali&lt;/a&gt; was also an official language. &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20language\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; was also widely spoken. Somali was then written using an &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20script\"&gt;Arabic script&lt;/a&gt;, not adopting the &lt;a href=\"Latin%20script\"&gt;Latin script&lt;/a&gt; until 1972.\nAnthem, flag and coat of arms.\nThe Somali national anthem from 1950 to 1960 was \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20Canto%20degli%20Italiani\"&gt;Il Canto degli Italiani&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Song of the Italians\"), the same as the Italian .\nFrom 1 April 1950 to 21 October 1954, the Trusteeship used solely the flag of Italy. From 21 October until independence, the Italian flag was accompanied by that of the UN. On 1 July 1960, Independence Day of Somalia, the Italian and UN flags were lowered to the tune of \"Il Canto degli Italiani\" at the Governor's Palace in Mogadishu to symbolize the end of Italian control over the region.\nThe Italian coat of arms was solely used until 21 October 1954, when both the Italian and Somali coat of arms were used jointly. After independence, the Italian coat of arms ceased its official status.\nCurrency.\nThe currency of the Trusteeship was the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Somaliland%20somalo\"&gt;somalo&lt;/a&gt;. It was coined by the &lt;a href=\"Banca%20d%27Italia\"&gt;Bank of Italy&lt;/a&gt; for the \"&lt;a href=\"Cassa%20per%20la%20Circolazione%20Monetaria%20della%20Somalia\"&gt;Cassa per la Circolazione Monetaria della Somalia&lt;/a&gt;\" (the Trusteeship's central bank). The Somalo was replaced in 1962 with the &lt;a href=\"Somali%20shilling\"&gt;Somali shilling&lt;/a&gt;."
