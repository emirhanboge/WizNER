    "text": "Delaware Wild Lands, Inc. is a private, non-profit tax-exempt organization dedicated to the conservation and preservation of natural areas through the acquisition and management of strategic parcels of land.\nBackground.\nThe Organization was established in 1961 by founder/president Edmund H. \"Ted\" Harvey. Delaware Wild Lands' first purchase was approximately 80 acres of land surrounding Trussum Pond, in &lt;a href=\"Sussex%20County%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;Sussex County, Delaware&lt;/a&gt;. In the following years, approximately 1700 acres were acquired surrounding Trussum Pond, all of which has since been transferred to the state of Delaware, and is now part of &lt;a href=\"Trap%20Pond%20State%20Park\"&gt;Trap Pond State Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nDelaware Wild Lands currently owns and manages over 19,000 acres spread across all three counties of Delaware, and a small portion in &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.\nDelaware Wild Lands' largest contiguous holding is &lt;a href=\"Great%20Cypress%20Swamp\"&gt;The Great Cypress Swamp&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Delaware Wild Lands is engaged in active &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Management\"&gt;Forest Management&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Sustainable%20Forestry%20Initiative\"&gt;SFI&lt;/a&gt; certified sustainable timber harvest. The goal of much of this harvest is for site preparation for the restoration of &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20white%20cedar\"&gt;Atlantic White-cedar&lt;/a&gt;. Delaware Wild Lands is also responsible for protecting nearly 3,500 acres of coastal marsh near &lt;a href=\"Blackbird%20Creek%20%28Delaware%29\"&gt;Blackbird Creek&lt;/a&gt; from development by shell Oil in the early 1970s."
