The mayor is not elected, but is appointed by the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Somalia\"&gt;President of Somalia&lt;/a&gt;. The mayor also holds the title of Governor of &lt;a href=\"Banaadir\"&gt;Benaadir&lt;/a&gt;, an administrative region whose territory is coextensive with the city of Mogadishu.\nHistory of the office.\nThe first mayor of Mogadishu was &lt;a href=\"Romeo%20Campani\"&gt;Romeo Campani&lt;/a&gt;, an Italian expatriate who was appointed by General &lt;a href=\"Rodolfo%20Graziani\"&gt;Rodolfo Graziani&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20of%20Italian%20Somaliland\"&gt;Governor of Italian Somaliland&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning in 1953 with the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Cali%20Cumar%20Sheegow\"&gt;Cali Cumar Sheegow&lt;/a&gt;, the office of mayor has been held by native Somalis. After Somalian independence from Italy in 1960, the mayor has been appointed by the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Somalia\"&gt;President of Somalia&lt;/a&gt;.\nList of mayors.\nColonial mayors.\nThe following mayors of Mogadishu were appointed by the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20of%20Italian%20Somaliland\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Somaliland\"&gt;Italian Somaliland&lt;/a&gt;. From 1941 to 1949, resulting from &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the British occupied the territory and appointed the mayors, who remained Italians. Beginning in 1953, native Somalis were appointed to the office.\nPost-independence mayors.\nSince Somalia's independence on 1 July 1960, mayors of Mogadishu have been appointed by the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Somalia\"&gt;President of Somalia&lt;/a&gt;:\nVice mayors.\nThe mayor of Mogadishu is assisted by a vice mayor or deputy mayor. The current vice mayor is &lt;a href=\"Iman%20Nur%20Ikar\"&gt;Iman Nur Ikar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiving former mayors.\nLiving former mayors of Mogadishu include: &lt;a href=\"Hassan%20Mohamed%20Hussein\"&gt;Hassan Mohamed Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hassan%20Abshir%20Farah\"&gt;Hassan Abshir Farah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Hussein%20Jimaale\"&gt;Yusuf Hussein Jimaale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mohamed%20Nur\"&gt;Mohamed Nur&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn popular culture.\nTowards the end of the &lt;a href=\"Somali%20Rebellion\"&gt;Somali Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, President &lt;a href=\"Siad%20Barre\"&gt;Siad Barre&lt;/a&gt; was sometimes mockingly referred to by many as the \"Mayor of Mogadishu,\" based on the fact that Barre controlled little territory outside the capital. By 1989, when the &lt;a href=\"United%20Somali%20Congress\"&gt;United Somali Congress&lt;/a&gt; had captured most surrounding towns and villages, this had become a common saying in Somalia, and on 29 September 1990, the British newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Economist\"&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;\" used the phrase in reference to Barre.\nDuring the early 1990s, after the overthrow of the Siad regime and during the &lt;a href=\"Somali%20famine\"&gt;Somali famine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Eldon\"&gt;Dan Eldon&lt;/a&gt;, a British photojournalist who covered the famine and conflict, became popular among Mogadishans that he was nicknamed the \"Mayor of Mogadishu.\""
