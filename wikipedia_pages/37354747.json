    "text": "Abudwak Airport (), is an &lt;a href=\"airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; serving &lt;a href=\"Abudwak\"&gt;Abudwak&lt;/a&gt; and nearby residents including across border, a highly populated \ntown in the central &lt;a href=\"Galguduud\"&gt;Galguduud&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Somalia\"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;. It is also known as Caabudwaaq \nAirport.\nOverview.\nThe airport was constructed by the &lt;a href=\"Siad%20Barre\"&gt;Siad Barre&lt;/a&gt; administration. Following the &lt;a href=\"Somali%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; that subsequently broke out in the early 1990s, the facility incurred significant damage.\nA major renovation project was later launched in 2011, funded by Somali expatriates from the province. In June 2012, the Somali-American Women's Foundation (SAWF) also contributed $70,000 toward the facelift, after the airport's rehabilitation committee had approached it.\nAccording to a government official, all of the facility's sections have since been renovated and are available for use. However, the immigration wing is still being built as of October 2012.\nThe new airport began scheduled flights on 11 October 2012."
