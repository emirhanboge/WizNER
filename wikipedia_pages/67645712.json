    "text": "The Twenty-two vows or twenty-two pledges are the 22 Buddhist vows administered by &lt;a href=\"B.%20R.%20Ambedkar\"&gt;B. R. Ambedkar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dalit%20Buddhist%20movement\"&gt;revivalist of Buddhism in India&lt;/a&gt;, to his followers. On converting to &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, Ambedkar made 22 vows, and asked his 600,000 supporters to do the same. After receiving &lt;a href=\"Buddhist%20initiation%20ritual\"&gt;lay ordination&lt;/a&gt;, Ambedkar gave \"&lt;a href=\"dharma\"&gt;dhamma&lt;/a&gt; diksha\" to his followers. The ceremony included 22 vows administered to all new converts after &lt;a href=\"Three%20Jewels\"&gt;Three Jewels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Five%20Precepts\"&gt;Five Precepts&lt;/a&gt;. On 14 October 1956 at &lt;a href=\"Nagpur\"&gt;Nagpur&lt;/a&gt;, Ambedkar performed another mass religious conversion ceremony at &lt;a href=\"Chandrapur\"&gt;Chandrapur&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is believed by &lt;a href=\"Navayana\"&gt;Ambedkarite Buddhists&lt;/a&gt; that these vows are the guidelines of the social revolution that motivates human instincts. These vows demonstrate both the &lt;a href=\"social%20movement\"&gt;social movement&lt;/a&gt; aspect of &lt;a href=\"Navayana%20Buddhism\"&gt;Navayana Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, and demonstrate its core deviation from earlier &lt;a href=\"Schools%20of%20Buddhism\"&gt;sects of Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;. In India, these vows are taken as an oath by individuals or groups of people when they convert to Buddhism. \nVows.\nThe following are the 22 vows administered by Ambedkar to his followers. \nThe vows marble stone.\nConsidering the historical significance of these twenty-two vows, the then president of \"Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Deekshabhoomi Memorial Committee\", and former Governor of Bihar and Kerala &lt;a href=\"R.%20S.%20Gavai\"&gt;R. S. Gavai&lt;/a&gt; and Sadanand Fulzele, the secretary of the organization, have carved these 22 vows on a wide marble stone at the Deekshabhoomi ground and placed the pillar at the first sight of the stupa. At a &lt;a href=\"Peace_Pagoda%23Wardha%2C_India\"&gt;Buddha Vihara at Wardha&lt;/a&gt;, under M. L. Kasare's leadership, a similar grand pillar has been erected. According to the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Census%20of%20India\"&gt;2011 Census of India&lt;/a&gt;, Ambedkarite Navayana Buddhists comprise about 87% (7.3 million) of Indian Buddhist community, and nearly 90% (6.5 million) of all Navayana Buddhists in India live in a single state, &lt;a href=\"Maharashtra\"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt;."
