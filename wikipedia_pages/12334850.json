    "text": "Roger Dilkes (born 16 August 1948) is an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; former &lt;a href=\"Football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Referee%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;referee&lt;/a&gt; who officiated in &lt;a href=\"the%20Football%20League\"&gt;the Football League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;. During his time on the National List he was based in &lt;a href=\"Mossley\"&gt;Mossley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nDilkes became a Football League &lt;a href=\"Assistant%20referee%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;linesman&lt;/a&gt; in 1980 and reached the Referees List just three years later at the age of thirty four. In March 1988 he handled the &lt;a href=\"Merseyside%20derby\"&gt;Merseyside derby&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Everton%20FC\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;. This would be a key match in any circumstances but took on far greater significance as Liverpool were aiming to set a (then) record of thirty matches unbeaten from the start of the season. Everton won 1\u20130, inflicting one of only two League defeats all season on Liverpool, who subsequently won the Title.\nHe continued to receive good appointments, many in the old &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Lancashire derbies. He did not achieve &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; status - he may have been unlucky in that only one vacancy occurred during his most eligible years. When more opportunities arose in 1992 he was then too old according to FIFA's newly introduced age criteria.\nDilkes was nevertheless chosen as one of the first set of Premier League referees for the &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1992\u201393&lt;/a&gt; season, and he retained this position for the final five years of his career. This period also saw him handle his most senior Cup appointments. The pinnacle was an &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"semi-final\"&gt;semi-final&lt;/a&gt; in 1994 between &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20FC\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luton%20Town%20FC\"&gt;Luton Town&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later he officiated in a &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-final second leg as &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt; overcame &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20FC\"&gt;Birmingham City&lt;/a&gt;. The following year he took charge of an FA Cup &lt;a href=\"quarter-final\"&gt;quarter-final&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Wednesday%20FC\"&gt;Sheffield Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%20FC\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; before retiring at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1996\u201397&lt;/a&gt; campaign."
