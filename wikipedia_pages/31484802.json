    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29\"&gt;Capt.&lt;/a&gt; Hugh Mitchell (3 December 1849 \u2013 16 August 1937) was a Scottish member of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Engineers\"&gt;Royal Engineers&lt;/a&gt; who later became a &lt;a href=\"barrister\"&gt;barrister&lt;/a&gt;. In his youth he was a keen &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; who played for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Engineers%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Royal Engineers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1872%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1872 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; and appeared for Scotland in two of the &lt;a href=\"England%20v%20Scotland%20representative%20matches%20%281870%E2%80%931872%29\"&gt;representative matches&lt;/a&gt; played against England in 1871 and 1872.\nFamily and education.\nMitchell was born in &lt;a href=\"Marylebone\"&gt;Marylebone&lt;/a&gt;, London, the son of Lieut. Col. Hugh Mitchell of the &lt;a href=\"Madras\"&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt; army and his wife Jessie n\u00e9e McCaskill. He was educated at &lt;a href=\"Harrow%20School\"&gt;Harrow School&lt;/a&gt; between 1864 and 1867 before going to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Military%20Academy%2C%20Woolwich\"&gt;Royal Military Academy, Woolwich&lt;/a&gt;. At Harrow, he was a keen sportsman, representing the school at &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; and shooting.\nIn 1878, he married Mary Catherine \"Katie\" Creswell, the sister of Col. &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Creswell\"&gt;Edmund Creswell&lt;/a&gt; who had played alongside him in the 1872 FA Cup Final. They had seven children, including &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Euen%20Mitchell\"&gt;Philip Euen Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; (1890\u20131964), who served as &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Uganda\"&gt;Governor of Uganda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Heads%20of%20Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. Katie died in 1892 following the birth of her youngest child. Mitchell had always been \"rather dour\" and his wife's death was \"an incurable loss and grief\" to him; as a result, he became more withdrawn and was seen by his grandchildren as a \"patriarchal and terrifying figure\".\nFootball career.\nMitchell played as a forward who was described as \"a good charger and useful forward [who] sticks to the ball well\". He was part of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Engineers%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Royal Engineers&lt;/a&gt; team who reached the final of the inaugural &lt;a href=\"1871%E2%80%9372%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; tournament, scoring a goal in the &lt;a href=\"1871%E2%80%9372%20FA%20Cup%23Semi-finals\"&gt;semi-final replay&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.%20%281861%29\"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. In the final, played at &lt;a href=\"Kennington%20Oval\"&gt;Kennington Oval&lt;/a&gt; on 16 March 1872, the Engineers were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; by a single goal, scored by &lt;a href=\"Morton%20Betts\"&gt;Morton Betts&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 1871, he was selected to play for Scotland in the fourth of a &lt;a href=\"England%20v%20Scotland%20representative%20matches%20%281870%E2%80%931872%29\"&gt;series of matches&lt;/a&gt; between teams representing Scotland and England; he qualified for the Scottish team by virtue of his father's Scottish origins. The match ended in a 2\u20131 defeat, with the Scots' goal being scored by Mitchell's Royal Engineers team-mate, Lieut. &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Renny-Tailyour\"&gt;Henry Renny-Tailyour&lt;/a&gt;. He retained his place in the Scottish team for the final match in the series, played the following February, which ended in a 1\u20130 victory for the English.\nMilitary career.\nMitchell joined the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Engineers\"&gt;Royal Engineers&lt;/a&gt; as a Lieutenant on 8 January 1870. He was posted to &lt;a href=\"Bermuda\"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt; from 1873 to 1875 and then to Gibraltar before returning to England in 1878 where he worked in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Office\"&gt;War Office&lt;/a&gt;. Although he was promoted to the rank of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; on 8 January 1882, he retired from the army two months later to qualify as a lawyer.\nLegal career.\nHe became a student of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Temple\"&gt;Inner Temple&lt;/a&gt; on 21 January 1881 (then aged 31) and was called to the bar on 7 May 1884. He moved to South Wales where he operated on the South Wales and Chester Circuit and the Glamorgan Sessions. He practiced in Gibraltar and Tangier from 1896.\nHe retired in 1926 and moved to South Africa where he died at &lt;a href=\"Brakpan\"&gt;Brakpan&lt;/a&gt; on 16 August 1937."
