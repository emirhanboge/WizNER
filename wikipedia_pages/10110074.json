They have three younger brothers. The twin's study of music began when they were only four years old, before they could read and write. Their music teacher taught them &lt;a href=\"musical%20notation\"&gt;musical notation&lt;/a&gt; with the help of colors; they remembered that red denoted C, blue D, yellow E, lilac F, and so on. At age of nine, the Bal\u0131ks left piano playing and dedicated themselves to singing.\nThe twins were educated in the State Conservatory of &lt;a href=\"Dokuz%20Eyl%C3%BCl%20University\"&gt;Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University&lt;/a&gt; in \u0130zmir, and then attended the master classes of &lt;a href=\"Lia%20Lantieri\"&gt;Lia Lantieri&lt;/a&gt; (1998), &lt;a href=\"Katia%20Ricciarelli\"&gt;Katia Ricciarelli&lt;/a&gt; (2000), &lt;a href=\"Dolora%20Zajick\"&gt;Dolora Zajick&lt;/a&gt; (2000\u20132003) and &lt;a href=\"Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo\"&gt;Pl\u00e1cido Domingo&lt;/a&gt; (2003\u20132004).

They continued their education in &lt;a href=\"Prayner%20Conservatory\"&gt;Prayner Conservatory&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; between 2001 and 2003.\nCareer.\nFollowing the graduation from the conservatory in \u0130zmir, they won the audition at the &lt;a href=\"Cemal%20Re%C5%9Fit%20Rey%20Concert%20Hall\"&gt;Cemal Re\u015fit Rey Concert Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; and started singing there.

After their further education in Vienna, Didem and Sinem gave several concerts in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and also in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The Bal\u0131k sisters wore &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20folklore\"&gt;traditional Turkish&lt;/a&gt; clothing &lt;a href=\"kaftan\"&gt;kaftan&lt;/a&gt; at their appearances with &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20music\"&gt;Turkish music&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;s, the sisters sing &lt;a href=\"operetta\"&gt;operetta&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20musicals\"&gt;Broadway musicals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Music%20of%20France\"&gt;French melodies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canzone%20Napoletana\"&gt;Italian Neapolitans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lied\"&gt;lied&lt;/a&gt;er.\nIn 2001, the sisters were finalists at the \"4th International de Vivo Voix Competition\".\nThe sisters performed concerts throughout the world, including; New York, Washington DC, Antalya, Ankara, \u0130stanbul, \u0130zmir, D\u00fcsseldorf, Essen, Frankfurt, Galaz and performed at very special venues like Vienna City Hall, United Nations, Hoffburg Palace, Turkish Embassy in Vienna, D\u00fcsseldorf Parliament Building, European Parliament and Startmore Music Center. They performed in front of many VIP guests such as Turkish and Austrian Presidents, King of Benin, European MPs, princes and princesses. They have been invited to make guest appearances to many important international festivals.\nPl\u00e1cido Domingo said of them \u201cthey are perfect for the sister role in Cosi Fan Tutte of Mozart, I see no reason for them not to have a universal career\u201d. After listening to them at a concert in New York, Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn, the founder of Atlantic Records, suggested that everybody should hear the OperTwins sing and that he was smitten by them.\nThey studied repertoire, technique and interpretation with the famous American Mezzo Soprano Dolora Zajick who said that \"Opera is one of the highest forms of art and deserves the best best quality artists, and the OperaTwins definitely have this potential\"."
