    "text": "Raven Oak (born December 21, 1977 in &lt;a href=\"Riverside%2C%20California\"&gt;Riverside, California&lt;/a&gt;) is an American author, whose written works range from science fiction &amp; &lt;a href=\"fantasy\"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; to cross-genre. She is most known for her bestselling epic fantasy, \"Amaskan's Blood\", and her space operas, \"Class-M Exile\" and \"The Eldest Silence\". She wrote her first novel, a 320-page fantasy work at age twelve. She is also a pianist and songwriter, whose musical works deal with the survival side of life. Currently residing in &lt;a href=\"Seattle%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, Oak is currently focusing on writing novels full-time.\nEarly life.\nOak grew up in many places around the U.S. including California, &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, Florida, and &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where she eventually attended &lt;a href=\"Richland%20College\"&gt;Richland College&lt;/a&gt; and later the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Texas\"&gt;University of North Texas&lt;/a&gt; as a music major. A military child, her family moved frequently until they settled in &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; in 1989. Her maternal grandmother was a public school teacher in California and under her tutelage, Oak was reading and writing at age three.\nOak knew \"since the age of five\" that she \"wanted to be a writer,\" a wish that never changed through the years. \"They said I could be anything, do anything. So I did!\"\nAfter high school, the rest of the family moved out of state, but Oak remained in &lt;a href=\"North%20Texas\"&gt;North Texas&lt;/a&gt; to attend college and received both her Bachelor of Science Degree and Master of Science Degree in &lt;a href=\"Computers%20in%20education%20and%20cognitive%20systems\"&gt;CECS&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"UNT\"&gt;UNT&lt;/a&gt;.\nWriting career.\nEarly writings.\nOak has written stories for as long as she can remember, and before that, she was telling them. She wrote her first novel, \"The Cry of the Dragon\" at age twelve. The novel was heavily influenced by &lt;a href=\"Anne%20McCaffrey\"&gt;Anne McCaffrey&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Pern\"&gt;Pern&lt;/a&gt; novels. Before that, she wrote a children's novel titled \"The Fish and the Lion,\" which was published as part of a case study on childhood literacy for the University of Florida.\nShe spent middle and high school \"devouring all the science fiction and &lt;a href=\"fantasy\"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; novels\" she could find, and her writing shifted towards the authors who influenced her most: &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Gaiman\"&gt;Neil Gaiman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Connie%20Willis\"&gt;Connie Willis&lt;/a&gt;. Oak was the vice president of her high school's \"Writer's Guild,\" a club for aspiring writers. Its faculty adviser was author Linda L. Donahue (writer of \"The Four Redheads of the Apocalypse\"), who mentored Oak on writing and invited her to join a local writers' critique group. While Oak learned how to critique, she struggled with finding her own voice. It wasn't until her late-twenties that she felt her craft up to par.\nProfessional writing.\nIn the winter of 2012, Oak retired from teaching computers and moved to &lt;a href=\"Seattle%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/a&gt; to pursue her full-time writing career.

In 2018, she became an Active member of the &lt;a href=\"Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fantasy%20Writers%20of%20America\"&gt;Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America&lt;/a&gt;. She is also a member of several PNW writing groups.\nHer first &lt;a href=\"fantasy\"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; novel, \"Amaskan's Blood,\" was published in January 2015 by small publisher, Grey Sun Press, and was followed up in 2018 by its sequel, \"Amaskan's War\". Oak also hinted in a recent interview at a standalone novel featuring the character Ida Warhammer from \"Amaskan's Blood\". \"Class-M Exile\", a science fiction novella, was released in June 2015. Two stories, \"The Ringers\" and \"Ol' St. Nick\", were released in a mystery/speculative fiction collection with mystery author, Maia Chance, award-winning science fiction author Janine Southard, and fantasy author Gayle Clemans. The collection, entitled \"Joy to the Worlds: Mysterious Speculative Fiction for the Holidays\" was accompanied by a book tour with the four authors. \"The Eldest Silence\", which takes place in the same universe as \"Class-M Exile\", will also be released in 2017. Her short story \"Q-Be\" will be published on October 1, 2016 in \"Untethered: A Magic iPhone Anthology\" by Cantina Publishing. The anthology is based on the book \"Cracked: A Magic iPhone Story\" which is set in Seattle, Washington and features gamers who find a magic iPhone. Her short story \"Mirror Me\" was published on October 15, 2016 in \"Magic Unveiled: An Anthology\" by Creative Alchemy, Inc.

Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brenda%20Cooper\"&gt;Brenda Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20Gerrold\"&gt;David Gerrold&lt;/a&gt;, and others. Her short story, \"Weightless,\" was published in \"The Great Beyond Anthology\" in 2020 and focuses on the &lt;a href=\"ableist\"&gt;ableist&lt;/a&gt; focus of space travel, while her story \"Learning to Fly,\" will also be published in the \"It Has Pockets\" Anthology by Clockwork Dragon.\nHer \"Flashback Friday,\" column focuses on science-fiction or fantasy novels that influenced writers, and have featured authors J.

Le Guin: A Brief Tribute\"\nThe Boahim Series.\nIn \"Amaskan's Blood,\" Book I of the Boahim Series, the heroine of the novel is an Amaskan, one of Boahim's assassins tasked with ensuring justice across the Little Dozen Kingdoms. In the land of Boahim, Amaskan's are holy assassins and feel they work for the greater good. When asked about this in a recent interview, Oak said, \"They truly believe they are serving justice and the greater good. They feel certain people should die because they are...murderers or rapists...Adelei learns the hard way that it's not always that simple.\"\nOver the course of the novel, she discovers that her past is a lie. She can trust no-one, not even her family. Despite her training and struggles, she fights to see justice through to the end. It's been called her most personal novel to date as it was heavily influenced by her own reconnection with her estranged mother. \"It has a coming-of-age arc of typical epic fantasy, with the seedy underbelly of what makes a family family and what makes us believe as we do.\"\n\"Amaskan's Blood\" was a 2016 EPIC Award Finalist and became an Amazon bestselling fantasy on February 19, 2015, a little over a month after its release. Book Digits called \"Amaskan's Blood\" \"an epic fantasy filled with intrigue and layers upon layers of well crafted secrets and lies\" and gave it a grade A. It was also a 2016 Ozma Fantasy Award winner and a 2019 Readers' Favorite Bronze Award Winner for YA Epic Fantasy.\nThe series continues with Book II, \"Amaskan's War,\" published on August 1, 2018, was a finalist in the UK Wishing Shelf Book Awards for Best Young Adult Book.\nClass-M Exile.\n\"Class-M Exile\" is a space opera novella, also through Grey Sun Press. The novella focuses on society's fear of the unknown, and the prejudices societies carry. In a discussion on the Hugo nominated Skiffy &amp; Fanty Show, Oak said, \"Some of the same diversity issues we're dealing with now across the United States are themes in this novella.\"\nThe story began during a Locus Writers' Workshop when Oak was asked to think of an event that impacted her emotionally as a child. Oak picked a memory of when a new student arrived at her small Texas town middle school. In a recent interview at the Seattle Comedy Group after-party, Oak said, \"She was everything not Texas...and everyone was trying to stampede away from [her] like she had the plague. It bothered me that no one wanted to know her, so of course I made her my best friend.\"\nThe main character\u2014a four-eyed, three legged alien with a fake &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; drawl\u2014has spent his life researching humans. \"[Eerl's] never seen one, never met one, because they don't really exist anymore. And then he meets one.\" The story follows Eerl in his quest to find out what a fish is while defending Mel (a human) from the prejudice of the universe.\n\"Class-M Exile\" was a Top 100 Hot New Release on Amazon UK and ranked as an Amazon US bestseller in space opera on June 24, 2015. In an interview with the author, members of the podcast SciFi Diner said, \"[\"Class-M Exile\"] really does do what [Star] Trek does, in that it functions well in social commentary. If you like science fiction that really deals with social commentary...you need to check this book out! You need to put this author on your radar.\"\nJoy to the Worlds.\n\"Joy to the Worlds: Mysterious Speculative Fiction for the Holidays\" was recently named a Foreword Review Book of the Year Award finalist and was listed in the \"Seattle Times\" as a #1 Bestselling paperback locally. The book was also a #1 Hot New Release in Amazon Sci-Fi Anthologies and a Top 100 Bestseller in Amazon Holiday Stories.\nFrom the Worlds of Raven Oak.\n\"From the Worlds of Raven Oak\" is an art book illustrated and written by Oak, featuring scenes, characters, and settings from her various novels and short stories.\nAdaptations.\nIn August 2016, \"Class-M Exile\" made it to the stage as part of the Seattle Literary Festival \"Bibliophilia\". This three day festival, run by improv-actor, writer, and editor, Jekeva Phillips, \"combines...theater and literature into a cross-disciplinary storytelling celebration.\" Oak began the festival by reading chapter one from \"Class-M Exile\" on opening night. The reading was followed by a re-enactment of the story by local improv troupe, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//seattlecomedygroup.com/\"&gt;CSz Seattle&lt;/a&gt;.\nMusic career.\nWhile Oak continued writing novels throughout college, she began her university studies as a &lt;a href=\"music%20composition\"&gt;music composition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Music%20theory\"&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; major, her primary instrument being the piano. A piano player since the age of five, she was gifted with the ability to &lt;a href=\"Learning%20music%20by%20ear\"&gt;play by ear&lt;/a&gt;. Her ability to learn instruments quickly gained her the spot of 1st chair in her middle school's top band just two months after joining beginning band. She was also named 1st chair in the All-Region Honor Band.\nShe found the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Texas\"&gt;University of North Texas&lt;/a&gt; music program stiffing as she did not fit into its &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; or opera style. In 2001, she changed majors to &lt;a href=\"Computers%20in%20education%20and%20cognitive%20systems\"&gt;CECS&lt;/a&gt; and released her first CD, \"&lt;a href=\"Walls%2C%20Boxes%2C%20%26amp%3B%20Jars\"&gt;Walls, Boxes, &amp; Jars&lt;/a&gt;.\" The CD's sales donated to &lt;a href=\"RAINN\"&gt;RAINN&lt;/a&gt;, the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network. RAINN, founded by musician &lt;a href=\"Tori%20Amos\"&gt;Tori Amos&lt;/a&gt;, is America's only national hotline for rape and abuse. Through her lengthy support and advocacy of RAINN, Oak is listed as a corporate partner of the non-profit organization.\nOf Oak's music, Score! Music says: \"Perfectly stunning musical compositions that, though they lack vocals, do not lack in emotional impact; it\u2019s as though one can venture inside Oak\u2019s being through her beautiful piano work. Think Tori Amos unplugged and without lyrics.\" Splendid Magazine says, \"...Oak transcends the damning excesses of the Lilith Fair ghetto...if it's the job of a musician to tell stories through her instruments, Raven Oak does her job exceedingly well.\"\nHer music career is currently on hiatus with an unknown release date for her second album, titled \"Fight or Flight.\"\nDiscography.\nShaded Tree Records"
