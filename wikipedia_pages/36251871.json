    "text": "Schleswig Air Base is an airbase of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Air%20Force\"&gt;German Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, home to &lt;a href=\"Taktisches%20Luftwaffengeschwader%2051\"&gt;Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 51&lt;/a&gt; (Tactical Air Force Wing 51) \"Immelmann\" (AKG 51) flying reconnaissance variants of the &lt;a href=\"Panavia%20Tornado\"&gt;Panavia Tornado&lt;/a&gt;. It was formerly known from c.1945-1958 as RAF Schleswigland in &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; use.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"airfield\"&gt;airfield&lt;/a&gt; in Schleswig/Jagel was founded in 1916 and has been in military use since. During the Second World War, night fighters were based here, including the &lt;a href=\"Messerschmitt%20Me%20262\"&gt;Messerschmitt Me 262&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the end of World War II &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Germany\"&gt;British Air Force of Occupation&lt;/a&gt; took control of the field on 6 May 1945, which they called \"Airfield B.164\". In the Summer of 1945 &lt;a href=\"Hawker%20Typhoon\"&gt;Hawker Typhoon Ibs&lt;/a&gt; of \"No. 121 Wing RAF\" were based there. In February 1948 RAF Schleswigland became active again as a training field for transport- and glider-aircraft from other stations. RAF Schleswigland was chosen as an operating base for the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Airlift\"&gt;Berlin Airlift&lt;/a&gt; (RAF Codename Operation Plainfare) in the fall of 1948. On 11 November 1948 the first transport aircraft, &lt;a href=\"Handley%20Page%20Hastings\"&gt;Handley Page Hastings C.1s&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"No.%2047%20Squadron%20RAF\"&gt;No. 47 Squadron RAF&lt;/a&gt; arrived. &lt;a href=\"No.%20297%20Squadron%20RAF\"&gt;No. 297 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; followed later during the airlift. Civilian companies started using RAF Schleswigland to airlift fuel to Berlin, since Schleswigland was well equipped which underground fuel lines dating from German use during the war. \"Lancashire Aircraft Corp.\" started flight on 24 November 1948 which specially converted &lt;a href=\"Handley%20Page%20Halifax\"&gt;Handley Page Halifax&lt;/a&gt;/Haltons, \"British American Air Services\" with &lt;a href=\"Handley%20Page%20Halton\"&gt;Handley Page Halton&lt;/a&gt; starting 25 January 1949, &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Airways\"&gt;Westminster Airways&lt;/a&gt; with Handley Page Halton starting 29 January 1949 and &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Airlines\"&gt;Scottish Airlines&lt;/a&gt; effective 19 February 1949 with &lt;a href=\"Consolidated%20Liberator\"&gt;Consolidated Liberator&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn 6 October 1949 the last airlift flight operated out of RAF Schleswigland, marking the end of &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Blockade\"&gt;Operation Plainfare&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 1950s the 2.TTF was based at RAF Schleswigland with &lt;a href=\"De%20Havilland%20Mosquito%20TT.35\"&gt;De Havilland Mosquito TT.35&lt;/a&gt; used for target towing. \nIn 1955 King &lt;a href=\"Olav%20V%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Olav V of Norway&lt;/a&gt; visited RAF Schleswigland, since the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Norwegian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Norwegian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; was using the airfield for training from time to time since the end of the Second World War. \nOther units:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; closed RAF Schleswigland in April 1958 and turned the southern part of the field over to German control. In June 1958 the newly formed &lt;a href=\"German%20Navy\"&gt;German Navy&lt;/a&gt; based the \"Marinefliegergeschwader 1\", established on 12 March 1957 as Marinefliegergruppe 1 in &lt;a href=\"Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt;, in what was now known as Schleswig-Jagel.\nIn October 1959, the northern part of the airfield was handed over from the Royal Air Force to the &lt;a href=\"German%20Navy\"&gt;German Navy&lt;/a&gt;. But it wasn't until November 1961 when the British left the last building at Schleswigland. (German text only)"
