The Pro League was formed in 1999 as part of a need for a &lt;a href=\"professional\"&gt;professional&lt;/a&gt; league to strengthen the country's &lt;a href=\"Trinidad%20and%20Tobago%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;national team&lt;/a&gt; and improve the development of domestic players.

Trinidad and Tobago are also members of the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Caribbean Football Union&lt;/a&gt; and compete in regional competitions staged by the governing body.

In the case any Caribbean club is precluded, it is supplanted by the fourth-place finisher from the CFU Club Championship. Between 2008\u201309 and 2011\u201312, the Champions League was played as a twenty-four team tournament with a preliminary round, followed by a sixteen-team group stage (four groups of four), followed by an eight-team home-and-away single-elimination tournament. In early 2012, &lt;a href=\"CONCACAF\"&gt;CONCACAF&lt;/a&gt; announced a new format for the 2012\u201313 edition of its Champions League. Under the new format, the preliminary round would be eliminated, and group play would consist of eight groups of three teams each, with each group winner advancing to the quarterfinals.\nTrinidadians playing in foreign leagues.\nSince the early 1990s, many &lt;a href=\"Trinidad%20and%20Tobago\"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt; men have found opportunities playing football at the highest levels of foreign leagues.
