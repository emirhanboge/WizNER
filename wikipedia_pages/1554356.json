    "text": "The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is a committee of banking supervisory authorities that was established by the &lt;a href=\"central%20bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt; governors of the &lt;a href=\"Group%20of%20Ten%20%28economic%29\"&gt;Group of Ten&lt;/a&gt; countries in 1974. The committee expanded its membership in 2009 and then again in 2014. In 2019, the BCBS has 45 members from 28 Jurisdictions, consisting of Central Banks and authorities with responsibility of banking regulation.\nIt provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its objective is to enhance understanding of key supervisory issues and improve the quality of banking supervision worldwide. The Committee frames guidelines and standards in different areas \u2013 some of the better known among them are the international standards on capital adequacy, the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision and the Concordat on cross-border banking supervision. The Committee's Secretariat is located at the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20for%20International%20Settlements\"&gt;Bank for International Settlements (BIS)&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Basel\"&gt;Basel&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland. The &lt;a href=\"Bank%20for%20International%20Settlements\"&gt;Bank for International Settlements (BIS)&lt;/a&gt; hosts and supports a number of international institutions engaged in standard setting and financial stability, one of which is BCBS. Yet like the other committees, BCBS has its own governance arrangements, reporting lines and agendas, guided by the &lt;a href=\"central%20bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt; governors of the &lt;a href=\"Group%20of%20Ten%20%28economic%29\"&gt;Group of Ten&lt;/a&gt; (G10) countries.\nGoals.\nGlobalization in banking and financial markets was not accompanied by global regulation. National regulators remained the most important actors in banking practices. They had a capacity problem and an information problem. Therefore, the purpose of the BCBS is to encourage convergence toward common approaches and standards. The Committee is not a classical multilateral organization, in part because it has no founding treaty. BCBS does not issue binding regulation; rather, it functions as an informal forum in which policy solutions and standards are developed.\nThe Basel Committee formulates broad supervisory standards and guidelines and recommends statements of best practice in banking supervision (see &lt;a href=\"bank%20regulation\"&gt;bank regulation&lt;/a&gt; or \"&lt;a href=\"Basel%20III\"&gt;Basel III&lt;/a&gt; Accord\", for example) in the expectation that member authorities and other nations' authorities will take steps to implement them through their own national systems.\nOrganization.\nThe Basel committee along with its sister organizations, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Organization%20of%20Securities%20Commissions\"&gt;International Organization of Securities Commissions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"International%20Association%20of%20Insurance%20Supervisors\"&gt;International Association of Insurance Supervisors&lt;/a&gt; together make up the &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Forum\"&gt;Joint Forum&lt;/a&gt; of international financial regulators. However, the Committee is not autonomous. Although it has latitude, its work is reported to the central bank Governors of the G10. It cannot communicate conclusions, nor make proposals, to bodies outside the Bank for International Settlements without the general agreement and support of these Governors.\nSince 2019 the Chairman of the Committee is &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Cos\"&gt;Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez de Cos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20the%20Bank%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Governor of the Bank of Spain&lt;/a&gt;. Neil Esho is the acting Secretary General of the Basel Committee.\nMember countries.\nCurrently, committee members come from &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The Committee's Secretariat is located at the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20for%20International%20Settlements\"&gt;Bank for International Settlements (BIS)&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Basel\"&gt;Basel&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland. However, the BIS and the Basel Committee remain two distinct entities.\nUntil 2009, members included only developed countries: Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States. \nGroups.\nThe Committee is sub-divided into groups, each of which have specific task forces to work on specific issues:\nStandards.\nThe Committee agrees on standards for bank capital, liquidity and funding. Those standards are non-binding high-level principles. Members are expected but not obliged to undertake effort to implement them e.g. through domestic regulation."
