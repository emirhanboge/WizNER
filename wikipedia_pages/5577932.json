    "text": "Javier Alfonso L\u00f3pez Palmer (born July 11, 1977) is a &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rican%20people\"&gt;Puerto Rican&lt;/a&gt; former &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt;. He pitched in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) for the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt; (2003\u201305), &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt; (2005), &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; (2006\u201309), &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; (2010), and &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt; (2010\u201316). He was a &lt;a href=\"left-handed%20specialist\"&gt;left-handed specialist&lt;/a&gt; known for his sidearm delivery.\nL\u00f3pez attended the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, earning a degree in psychology despite leaving early to begin his baseball career. In 1997, he played &lt;a href=\"collegiate%20summer%20baseball\"&gt;collegiate summer baseball&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Falmouth%20Commodores\"&gt;Falmouth Commodores&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Cod%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Cape Cod Baseball League&lt;/a&gt;.

He began his career as a starting pitcher but struggled, and was converted into a sidearm (or submarine) reliever while still in the Diamondbacks' organization. Before the 2003 season, he was selected by the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Rule%205%20draft\"&gt;Rule 5 draft&lt;/a&gt;, but was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"spring%20training\"&gt;spring training&lt;/a&gt;. He spent all of 2003 on Colorado's roster, nearly tying the franchise record for most consecutive batters retired and finishing third among major league rookies in games pitched. He struggled the next two seasons, getting claimed off waivers and later sent to the minors by Arizona in 2005. In 2006, he signed with the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; but failed to make the team and spent the first part of the season in the minors before getting traded to Boston during the year.\nL\u00f3pez served four stints with Boston in 2006. In 2007, he had three different stints but appeared in 61 games, posting a 3.10 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; (ERA). He posted a 15.43 ERA in the playoffs but won his first &lt;a href=\"2007%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; ring as the Red Sox defeated Colorado in four games. In 2008, he spent the entire season on a major league roster for the first time since 2003. He posted a 9.26 ERA in his first 14 games of 2009 before getting sent to the minors for the rest of the season. In 2010, he signed with the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; but was traded to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt; during the season. He had his lowest ERA that year (2.34) and won another &lt;a href=\"2010%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; as the Giants defeated the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt; to win their first World Series since 1954. In 2011, L\u00f3pez was one of two major league relief pitchers to throw at least 50 innings without giving up a home run. He won his third &lt;a href=\"2012%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 as the Giants defeated the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Tigers\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; in four games. In 2013, L\u00f3pez posted a career-best 1.83 ERA. He won his fourth &lt;a href=\"2014%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 as the Giants defeated the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Royals\"&gt;Kansas City Royals&lt;/a&gt; in seven games. L\u00f3pez announced his retirement on February 8, 2017.\nEarly life.\nAlthough he was born in &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, L\u00f3pez grew up in &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Fairfax, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. He and his wife, Renee, attended &lt;a href=\"Robinson%20Secondary%20School\"&gt;Robinson Secondary School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Fairfax, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. Growing up, his dream was to be an &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; agent like his father.\nL\u00f3pez went to college at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; (UVA) and played for the &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Cavaliers%20baseball\"&gt;Virginia Cavaliers baseball&lt;/a&gt; team. Through August 2011, he was one of 29 former UVA players to have made it to the major leagues, along with among others &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Reynolds%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Mark Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Zimmerman\"&gt;Ryan Zimmerman&lt;/a&gt;. While playing at UVA, he &lt;a href=\"Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29\"&gt;went&lt;/a&gt; 12\u20139 with a 6.30 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; (ERA). As a hitter, he had a &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; of .319, 15 &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s, and 71 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt; (RBI). However, while still at UVA, he discovered that pitching was most likely to get him to the major leagues. Despite leaving college after only three years to play professional baseball, L\u00f3pez continued working on his degree in psychology, which he earned in 2002 to fulfill a promise to his father-in-law. He also said, \"I had done three years at a great university. I figured I should finish.\"\nProfessional career.\nDrafts and minor leagues.\nAfter three seasons at UVA, L\u00f3pez was drafted by the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt; in the fourth round of the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft\"&gt;1998 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft&lt;/a&gt;. He began his minor league career as a starting pitcher for the &lt;a href=\"South%20Bend%20Silver%20Hawks\"&gt;South Bend Silver Hawks&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Single-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Midwest%20League\"&gt;Midwest League&lt;/a&gt;. In 16 &lt;a href=\"Games%20pitched\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; (nine &lt;a href=\"games%20started\"&gt;starts&lt;/a&gt;), he had a 2\u20134 record, a 6.55 ERA, 31 &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt;s, and 30 &lt;a href=\"Base%20on%20balls\"&gt;walks&lt;/a&gt; in 44 &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings pitched&lt;/a&gt;. He remained at South Bend in 1999, posting a 4\u20136 record, a 6.00 ERA, and 70 strikeouts over 99 innings pitched in 20 starts. In 2000, L\u00f3pez was promoted to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Desert%20Mavericks\"&gt;High Desert Mavericks&lt;/a&gt; of the A-Advanced &lt;a href=\"California%20League\"&gt;California League&lt;/a&gt;. In 30 games (21 starts), he had a 4\u20138 record, a 5.22 ERA, 98 strikeouts, and two &lt;a href=\"Save%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;saves&lt;/a&gt; in innings.\nIn 2001, deciding that he would not be able to reach the major leagues as a starter, L\u00f3pez converted to a &lt;a href=\"Submarine%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;submariner&lt;/a&gt; and moved to the &lt;a href=\"bullpen\"&gt;bullpen&lt;/a&gt;. He said, \"I don't know if that was desperation as much as it was admitting failure.\" He began the season with Arizona's A-Advanced affiliate, which was now the &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%20JetHawks\"&gt;Lancaster JetHawks&lt;/a&gt;. In 17 games, he had a 1\u20133 record, a 2.62 ERA, 18 strikeouts, and one save in 24 innings pitched. He was promoted to the &lt;a href=\"El%20Paso%20Diablos\"&gt;El Paso Diablos&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Double-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;AA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Texas%20League\"&gt;Texas League&lt;/a&gt; that season, where he had a 1\u20130 record, a 7.42 ERA, 21 strikeouts, and 40 innings pitched in 22 games (one start, his last professionally). In 2002, he played in 61 games for El Paso as a reliever, allowing only a .204 &lt;a href=\"opponent%20batting%20average\"&gt;opponent batting average&lt;/a&gt;. That year, he went 2\u20132 with a 2.72 ERA, 47 strikeouts, and six saves in innings.\nColorado Rockies (2003\u20132005).\n2003.\nIn December 2002, the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; selected L\u00f3pez in the &lt;a href=\"Rule%205%20draft\"&gt;Rule 5 draft&lt;/a&gt;, intending for him to compete for a role as a &lt;a href=\"left-handed%20specialist\"&gt;left-handed specialist&lt;/a&gt; in the Red Sox' bullpen. However, on March 18 he was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"player%20to%20be%20named%20later\"&gt;player to be named later&lt;/a&gt; (Ryan Cameron). L\u00f3pez made the roster and made his MLB debut for the Rockies on &lt;a href=\"Opening%20Day\"&gt;Opening Day&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, pitching a scoreless inning in a 10\u20134 loss to the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;. He got his first major league strikeout in his next game on April 5, punching out &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Womack\"&gt;Tony Womack&lt;/a&gt; in a 4\u20133 victory over the Diamondbacks. On April 10, he got his first win, pitching scoreless innings in a 7\u20136 victory over the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;. He posted an 0.72 ERA, which led all NL relievers, in his first 30 games through June 8, posting an innings scoreless streak at the end of that run. However, his ERA jumped up to 3.16 on June 12, when he allowed seven runs in of an inning in a 15\u20133 loss to the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Twins\"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt;. From July 31 through August 16, L\u00f3pez almost tied a franchise record by retiring 18 straight hitters over the span of 17 days, but he fell short of the record of 21 set by &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Holmes%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Darren Holmes&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 when he &lt;a href=\"intentional%20base%20on%20balls\"&gt;intentionally walked&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Phillips%20%28catcher%29\"&gt;Jason Phillips&lt;/a&gt; in a 13\u20134 loss to the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt;. On August 12, he recorded his first career save by pitching a scoreless 11th inning in a 6\u20133 victory over the &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20Expos\"&gt;Montreal Expos&lt;/a&gt;. He played in 72 games, the third-most among rookies in the major leagues, trailing only &lt;a href=\"%C3%93scar%20Villarreal%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;\u00d3scar Villareal&lt;/a&gt; (86) and &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Lidge\"&gt;Brad Lidge&lt;/a&gt; (78). He had a 4\u20131 record, a 3.70 ERA, and 1 save.\n2004.\nL\u00f3pez started off poorly in 2004, going 0\u20132 with a 9.93 ERA in 46 games by mid-season. He was then sent down to the &lt;a href=\"Triple-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;AAA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Springs%20Sky%20Sox\"&gt;Colorado Springs Sky Sox&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League\"&gt;Pacific Coast League&lt;/a&gt; on July 18. While in AAA, he went 0\u20131 and had a 4.00 ERA in eight games. He was called back to the majors on August 10 to replace an injured &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Cook%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Aaron Cook&lt;/a&gt; and played the rest of the season in Colorado. He pitched better the rest of the season, allowing only two runs for a 1.54 ERA in his final 18 games. In 64 games, L\u00f3pez had a 1\u20132 record, a 7.52 ERA, 20 strikeouts, and no saves in innings.\n2005.\nL\u00f3pez began 2005 with the Rockies, but after allowing five runs in his first three games (for a 22.50 ERA), he was optioned to Colorado Springs on April 11.\nArizona Diamondbacks (2005).\nBefore he could appear in any games with Colorado Springs, L\u00f3pez was claimed off waivers by the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt; on April 14. Due to major league rules, Arizona was unable to call him up until April 24. He had another poor season, having a record of 1\u20131 and an 11.02 ERA, the highest in the majors among relievers who made at least 30 appearances. On July 5, L\u00f3pez was &lt;a href=\"designated%20for%20assignment\"&gt;designated for assignment&lt;/a&gt; to make room on the roster for &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Almanza\"&gt;Armando Almanza&lt;/a&gt;. He cleared waivers and was sent down to the &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Sidewinders\"&gt;Tucson Sidewinders&lt;/a&gt; of the Pacific Coast League for the rest of the season. He went 0\u20131 with a 2.22 ERA. On October 15, he was granted &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agency&lt;/a&gt;.\nChicago White Sox organization (2006).\nL\u00f3pez signed a minor league deal for the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; in 2006. He competed with &lt;a href=\"Boone%20Logan\"&gt;Boone Logan&lt;/a&gt; for the role of left-handed specialist, but Logan won the role, and L\u00f3pez was sent to AAA to begin the season. Playing for the &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20Knights\"&gt;Charlotte Knights&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"International%20League\"&gt;International League&lt;/a&gt;, he went 2\u20131 with 12 saves and an 0.55 ERA in 26 games.\nBoston Red Sox (2006\u20132009).\n2006.\nOn June 15, 2006, L\u00f3pez was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"David%20Riske\"&gt;David Riske&lt;/a&gt;. He posted a 4.32 ERA in 14 appearances before getting sent to the &lt;a href=\"Pawtucket%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Pawtucket Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; of the International League on July 17 because it was too \"tough\" for the Red Sox to carry a left-handed specialist at that point in the season, according to &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Francona\"&gt;Terry Francona&lt;/a&gt;. He was called up for two short stints from July 28 through August 1 and from August 20 through 22, appearing in one game each time. On September 4, he was recalled for the remainder of the season. In 11 September outings, L\u00f3pez allowed only one run. He finished the year going 1\u20130 with a 2.70 ERA in 27 games. With Pawtucket, he had no record and a 4.86 ERA in 13 games ( innings).\n2007.\nL\u00f3pez made the Red Sox' Opening Day roster in 2007, but after four scoreless outings he was optioned to Pawtucket on April 9 to make room for &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Timlin\"&gt;Mike Timlin&lt;/a&gt;, who had started the season on the disabled list. He was recalled on May 11 when &lt;a href=\"Devern%20Hansack\"&gt;Devern Hansack&lt;/a&gt; was sent down. On this stint, he posted a 3.18 ERA in 40 appearances before getting sent down on August 5 to make room for &lt;a href=\"Curt%20Schilling\"&gt;Curt Schilling&lt;/a&gt;, who was returning from the disabled list. With the Red Sox about to face several tough left-handed hitters in late August, &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Lester\"&gt;Jon Lester&lt;/a&gt; was sent down on August 23 to make room for L\u00f3pez on the roster. \nIn 2007, L\u00f3pez made 61 appearances, posting a 2\u20131 record with a 3.10 ERA in innings. Despite his three stints in the minors, his 61 appearances ranked second on the club to &lt;a href=\"Hideki%20Okajima\"&gt;Hideki Okajima&lt;/a&gt;'s 66. He made 17 appearances for Pawtucket, going 2\u20131 with a 3.78 ERA. L\u00f3pez was a member of the playoff roster for the Red Sox, posting a 15.43 ERA but winning his first &lt;a href=\"2007%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; as the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games.\n2008.\nOn January 18, 2008, L\u00f3pez agreed to a one-year contract with the Red Sox for $840,000, avoiding the &lt;a href=\"Pendulum%20arbitration\"&gt;arbitration&lt;/a&gt; process. In 2008, L\u00f3pez spent the full season on a major league roster for the first time since his rookie year. On June 6, he threw a career-high three innings, allowing no runs in an 8\u20130 loss to the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Mariners\"&gt;Seattle Mariners&lt;/a&gt;. In 70 games, L\u00f3pez had a 2\u20130 record, a 2.43 ERA, and 38 strikeouts in innings pitched. He had the fifth-lowest ERA among major league left-handed relievers and appeared in the fifth-most games of AL left-handers. He had the second-lowest ERA among Red Sox pitchers in 2008.\nL\u00f3pez made the playoffs for the second year in a row as the Red Sox won the AL &lt;a href=\"Wild%20card%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Wild Card&lt;/a&gt;. He made one appearance in the &lt;a href=\"2008%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;AL Division Series&lt;/a&gt; (ALDS) against the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim\"&gt;Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim&lt;/a&gt;, taking the loss in Game 3 after giving up a game-winning, twelfth-inning single to &lt;a href=\"Erick%20Aybar\"&gt;Erick Aybar&lt;/a&gt;. That was Boston's only loss of the series, as they defeated the Angels in four games. He made two appearances in the &lt;a href=\"2008%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;AL Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; (ALCS) against the &lt;a href=\"Tampa%20Bay%20Rays\"&gt;Tampa Bay Rays&lt;/a&gt;, allowing no runs as the Red Sox were defeated in seven games.\n2009.\nOn April 30, 2009, L\u00f3pez allowed five runs in inning and played the remainder of the eighth inning in right field after Francona switched him with right fielder &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Van%20Every\"&gt;Jonathan Van Every&lt;/a&gt;. This game, a 13\u20130 loss to the Rays, was the first time a Red Sox pitcher had played another position in a major league game since &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Burgmeier\"&gt;Tom Burgmeier&lt;/a&gt; played left field on August 3, 1980. On May 10, L\u00f3pez was designated for assignment to make room for pitcher &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Bard\"&gt;Daniel Bard&lt;/a&gt; after he started the year 0\u20132 with a 9.26 ERA in 14 games. Shortly thereafter, he was outrighted to the minors. He spent the rest of the season in Pawtucket, going 1\u20131 with a 3.18 ERA in 38 games. On October 5, he was granted free agency. L\u00f3pez ended his Red Sox tenure with a string of 152 straight games without a save, the longest stretch for a Red Sox pitcher since &lt;a href=\"Rh%C3%A9al%20Cormier\"&gt;Rh\u00e9al Cormier&lt;/a&gt; had 160 in 1995 and from 1999\u20132000.\nPittsburgh Pirates (2010).\nOn December 18, 2009, L\u00f3pez signed a one-year contract with the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; where he replaced &lt;a href=\"John%20Grabow\"&gt;John Grabow&lt;/a&gt;, who was traded mid-2009, as the Pirates' left-handed specialist. After posting a 10.80 ERA in his first two games, he posted a 2.43 ERA over his next 48 through July 31.\nSan Francisco Giants (2010\u20132016).\n2010.\nOn July 31, 2010, L\u00f3pez was traded to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Martinez%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Joe Martinez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Bowker%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;John Bowker&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared in 27 games for the Giants, earning a 2\u20130 record with an ERA of 1.42. His combined record of 4\u20132 for the year with both Pittsburgh and San Francisco came in 77 appearances with an ERA of 2.34, both career records. Left-handed batters hit only .162 against L\u00f3pez, lowest among all National League left-handers (minimum 85 at-bats). He ended the season five days short of qualifying for free agency.\nL\u00f3pez reached the playoffs as the Giants won the &lt;a href=\"NL%20West\"&gt;NL West&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 2003. He made two appearances in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20National%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;NLDS&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt; to face &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Heyward\"&gt;Jason Heyward&lt;/a&gt;, whom he struck out both times. The Giants won the series in four games. Against the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;NLCS&lt;/a&gt;, he made five appearances, all scoreless except for Game 4, in which he allowed a run. In the deciding Game 6, he pitched a scoreless seventh inning and was awarded with a win after &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Uribe\"&gt;Juan Uribe&lt;/a&gt; hit a game-winning home run against &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Madson\"&gt;Ryan Madson&lt;/a&gt; in the eighth inning. L\u00f3pez made two appearances against the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20World%20Series\"&gt;2010 World Series&lt;/a&gt;, striking out the two batters he faced. In Game 2, he struck out &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Hamilton\"&gt;Josh Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; to end the top of the eighth inning with a runner on second and preserve a 2\u20130 lead, although the Giants went on to win 9\u20130. He won his second World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series since 1954.\n2011.\nAfter joining the Giants in 2010, L\u00f3pez became one of the premier lefty specialists in the game. On May 12, 2011, he recorded his first save since 2006 in a 3\u20132 victory over the Diamondbacks. Following the game, he crossed his arms, imitating Giants' closer &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Wilson%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Brian Wilson&lt;/a&gt;'s post-save gesture. In 70 games in 2011, he had a 5\u20132 record, a 2.72 ERA, and 40 strikeouts in 50 innings pitched. He and &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Ziegler\"&gt;Brad Ziegler&lt;/a&gt; were the only relief pitchers in the major leagues to toss at least 50 innings without allowing a home run. His .163 &lt;a href=\"opponent%20batting%20average\"&gt;opponent batting average&lt;/a&gt; (OBA) against left-handers was the eighth-lowest in the NL.\n2012.\nAfter the 2011 season, the Giants re-signed L\u00f3pez to a two-year, $8.5 million contract. On July 6, 2012, L\u00f3pez gave up his first home run since joining the Giants in 2010 when he allowed a 457-foot home run to &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20%C3%81lvarez%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Pedro \u00c1lvarez&lt;/a&gt; in a 6\u20135 victory over the Pirates. That brought his ERA to 4.00, but he posted a 1.00 ERA over his last 32 games. Following struggles by &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Casilla\"&gt;Santiago Casilla&lt;/a&gt; (who had replaced an injured Wilson as the Giants' closer), Giants' manager &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Bochy\"&gt;Bruce Bochy&lt;/a&gt; announced on August 7 that the Giants would be going to a \"bullpen by committee\" strategy, with L\u00f3pez, &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Romo\"&gt;Sergio Romo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Affeldt\"&gt;Jeremy Affeldt&lt;/a&gt; pitching the final two innings of close games, depending on which hitters they would be facing. Romo and L\u00f3pez received most of the save opportunities; Affeldt only had one save after that point. L\u00f3pez received six save opportunities after August 7 and converted each of them. In 70 games, L\u00f3pez had a 3\u20130 record, a 2.50 ERA, and 28 strikeouts in 36 innings while converting seven out of nine save opportunities. He stranded 87.9% of &lt;a href=\"inherited%20runners\"&gt;inherited runners&lt;/a&gt;, the third-best mark in the NL. L\u00f3pez made five appearances in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20National%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;NLDS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2012%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;NLCS&lt;/a&gt;, allowing no runs as the Giants won both of those series. He did not pitch in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; but won his third career World Series ring as the Giants swept the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Tigers\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt;.\n2013.\nL\u00f3pez recorded his only save of the 2013 season on September 19, pitching the final of the ninth inning in a 2\u20131 victory over the Mets. He made 69 appearances in 2013, going 4\u20132 with a career-best 1.83 ERA and striking out 37 in innings. He held left-handed hitters to a .156 OBA. On November 20, 2013, L\u00f3pez was re-signed by the Giants to a three-year, $13 million contract.\n2014.\nL\u00f3pez appeared in 65 games in 2014, recording a 3.11 ERA with 22 strikeouts and 19 walks. In the 2014 &lt;a href=\"2014%20National%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;NLDS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2014%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;NLCS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"2014%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;, he recorded 11 outs over nine appearances, allowing 4 hits and a walk. Lopez won his fourth World Series ring as the Giants defeated the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Royals\"&gt;Kansas City Royals&lt;/a&gt; in seven games.\n2015.\nIn 2015, L\u00f3pez matched his career high with 77 appearances, setting new career-bests with a 1.60 ERA and 0.89 &lt;a href=\"walks%20plus%20hits%20per%20inning%20pitched\"&gt;WHIP&lt;/a&gt;. He struck out 26 batters in 39 innings pitched. Of all MLB pitchers, he held left-handed batters to the lowest batting average, .112 (in 20 or more innings).\n2016.\nL\u00f3pez appeared in 68 games in 2016, recording a 4.05 ERA with 15 strikeouts and 15 walks in 26 innings pitched. Along with teammate &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Crawford\"&gt;Brandon Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, L\u00f3pez won the &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Mac%20Award\"&gt;Willie Mac Award&lt;/a&gt;, which honors the Giants' most inspirational player.\nRetirement.\nL\u00f3pez announced his retirement on February 8, 2017. Soon afterwards, he re-joined the Giants as a special instructor during spring training. In February 2017 it was announced that Lopez, along with &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Affeldt\"&gt;Jeremy Affeldt&lt;/a&gt;, would be serving as part-time &lt;a href=\"color%20analyst\"&gt;color analyst&lt;/a&gt;s on Giants telecasts throughout the 2017 season, due to regular analyst &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Krukow\"&gt;Mike Krukow&lt;/a&gt; reducing his schedule. On June 2, Lopez joined, for the first time, the other &lt;a href=\"KNBR%20%28AM%29\"&gt;KNBR&lt;/a&gt; Giant's radio broadcasters during the after-game 'wrap-up' show.\nPitching style.\nL\u00f3pez's main pitch is a &lt;a href=\"two-seam%20fastball\"&gt;two-seam fastball&lt;/a&gt; in the mid 80s, and his secondary pitch is a &lt;a href=\"Slider%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;slider&lt;/a&gt; in the high 70s. Against left-handed hitters he will sometimes mix in a &lt;a href=\"curveball\"&gt;curveball&lt;/a&gt;. L\u00f3pez's distinctive sidearm delivery makes him appealing as a &lt;a href=\"left-handed%20specialist\"&gt;left-handed specialist&lt;/a&gt;; through the 2013 season, lefties have hit only .209 against him, while righties have hit .297.\nAfter L\u00f3pez struggled to begin his professional career, throwing over the top, he decided he needed to change his style. In the Diamondbacks' system in 2002, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Myers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Mike Myers&lt;/a&gt;, he began throwing sidearm (or submarine), which Andy Baggarly called \"a decision that changed his life.\"\nPersonal life.\nL\u00f3pez is married to Ren\u00e9e Richards, with whom he attended high school and college. The couple has two children: Kylan (March 19, 2010) and Christian (October 26, 2012). Because L\u00f3pez was in the 2012 World Series when Christian was born, he had to fly back home for the birth between Games 2 and 3. He and his family reside in &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. L\u00f3pez is a Christian. He says, \"I do everything through faith, for sure.\""
