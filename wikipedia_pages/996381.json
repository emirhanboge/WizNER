    "text": "Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre (18 June 1755 \u2013 22 September 1821), also known as Madame Dugazon, was a French &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic &lt;a href=\"mezzo-soprano\"&gt;mezzo-soprano&lt;/a&gt;, actress and &lt;a href=\"dancer\"&gt;dancer&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorn in Berlin as the daughter of a dancing master at the court of &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20II%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Frederick II of Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, she returned to Paris with her parents in 1765. She made her stage debut at the age of twelve as a dancer, but it was as an actress \"with songs\" that she made her debut at the Com\u00e9die Italienne in 1774 in &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Ernest%20Modeste%20Gr%C3%A9try\"&gt;Gr\u00e9try&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Sylvain\". She was at once admitted \"pensionnaire\" and in 1775 \"soci\u00e9taire\".\nShe became a star of the Com\u00e9die Italienne (which became the &lt;a href=\"Op%C3%A9ra-Comique\"&gt;Op\u00e9ra-Comique&lt;/a&gt;), where she created over 60 roles. She was married to the actor &lt;a href=\"Jean-Henri%20Gourgaud\"&gt;Jean-Henri Gourgaud&lt;/a&gt;, who went by the stage name Dugazon. Together they had a child, &lt;a href=\"Gustave%20Dugazon\"&gt;Gustave Dugazon&lt;/a&gt;. The couple soon divorced, but continued to perform at the Com\u00e9die Italienne for more than twenty years.\nThe two kinds of parts with which she was especially identified\u2014young mothers and women past their first youth\u2014are still called \"jeunes dugazons\" and \"m\u00e8res dugazons\" in French opera. Examples of the first are Jenny in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20dame%20blanche\"&gt;La dame blanche&lt;/a&gt;\" and Berthe de Simiane in \"Les mousquetaires de la reine\"; of the second, Marguerite in \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Pr%C3%A9%20aux%20clercs\"&gt;Le Pr\u00e9 aux clercs&lt;/a&gt;\" and the queen in \"La part du diable\". The type of voice for these roles is a light &lt;a href=\"mezzo-soprano\"&gt;mezzo-soprano&lt;/a&gt; or a dark-colored &lt;a href=\"soprano\"&gt;soprano&lt;/a&gt; leggero, and they are generally less demanding technically."
