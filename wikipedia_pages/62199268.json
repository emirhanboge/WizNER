    "text": "The Continental Basketball Association (CBA) was an American &lt;a href=\"semi-professional\"&gt;semi-professional&lt;/a&gt; basketball league that operated from 1969 to 1974.\nFounded in 1969, the league originally began from an idea to keep the &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; players from the Central States Football League in shape during the offseason. The \"Continental\" name was chosen over \"Central States Basketball League\" so that it would be more inviting to potential teams outside of &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, where the football league was based. The CBA played using &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt; rules, which included a 24-second &lt;a href=\"shot%20clock\"&gt;shot clock&lt;/a&gt;. Each team played a 20-game schedule, divided into 10 home games and 10 away.\nThe six inaugural teams in 1969\u201370 were located in Illinois (&lt;a href=\"Decatur%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Decatur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peoria%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Peoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockford%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Rockford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Waukegan%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Waukegan&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Grand Rapids&lt;/a&gt;) and Wisconsin (&lt;a href=\"Waukesha%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Waukesha&lt;/a&gt;). The Waukesha team began the season based in &lt;a href=\"Cudahy%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Cudahy, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, but moved mid-season due to lack of fan support. Though they were on top of the league's standings, the Medalist Mods were second to last in attendance. Waukesha went on to win the league title that season.\nDuring the 1970\u201371 season, the NBA &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Bucks\"&gt;Milwaukee Bucks&lt;/a&gt; entered a player-development agreement with the CBA &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Muskies\"&gt;Milwaukee Muskies&lt;/a&gt;. The Bucks ended the relationship the following season and the Muskies folded as a result. The &lt;a href=\"Chicagoland%20Travelers\"&gt;Chicagoland Travelers&lt;/a&gt; (originally named the Northwest Chicagoland Travelers) also folded after the 1970\u201371 season because they failed to come up with the $20,000\u2013$30,000 in annual operating costs.\nThe CBA folded after its 1973\u201374 season."
