    "text": "Roy Cecil Phillipps, &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;MC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medal%20bar\"&gt;&amp; Bar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;DFC&lt;/a&gt; (1 March 1892\u00a0\u2013 21\u00a0May 1941) was an Australian &lt;a href=\"flying%20ace\"&gt;fighter ace&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aviation%20in%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War\u00a0I&lt;/a&gt;. He achieved fifteen victories in aerial combat, four of them in a single action on 12\u00a0June 1918. A &lt;a href=\"pastoral%20farming\"&gt;grazier&lt;/a&gt; between the wars, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Australian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (RAAF) in 1940 and was killed in a plane crash the following year.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; but raised in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Phillipps joined the &lt;a href=\"First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force\"&gt;Australian Imperial Force&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt;man in April 1915, seeing action at &lt;a href=\"Gallipoli%20campaign\"&gt;Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;. Wounded twice in 1916, he transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Flying%20Corps\"&gt;Australian Flying Corps&lt;/a&gt; (AFC) and was accepted for pilot training in May 1917. As a member of &lt;a href=\"No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF\"&gt;No.\u00a02 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; in France, Phillipps flew mainly &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5\"&gt;S.E.5&lt;/a&gt; fighters, and was awarded two &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;Military Cross&lt;/a&gt;es and the &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Distinguished Flying Cross&lt;/a&gt; for his actions. He finished the war a &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;, commanding &lt;a href=\"No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF\"&gt;No.\u00a06 (Training) Squadron&lt;/a&gt; in England. Returning to Australia in 1919, he left the AFC and was managing a rural property when he enlisted in the RAAF soon after the outbreak of World War\u00a0II. At his death he was ranked &lt;a href=\"squadron%20leader\"&gt;squadron leader&lt;/a&gt;, commanding &lt;a href=\"No.%202%20Elementary%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF\"&gt;No.\u00a02 Elementary Flying Training School&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Archerfield%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Archerfield, Queensland&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nPhillipps was born on 1\u00a0March 1892 in &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;; sources differ on the exact location, which is variously recorded as rural &lt;a href=\"Moree%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Moree&lt;/a&gt; and metropolitan &lt;a href=\"North%20Sydney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;North Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. He was the son of William Hargreaves Phillipps, originally of &lt;a href=\"Northumberland\"&gt;Northumberland&lt;/a&gt;, England, and his wife Cecil. After his father died, Phillipps' mother took him to live in &lt;a href=\"Perth\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, Western Australia. Educated at &lt;a href=\"Hale%20School\"&gt;Hale School&lt;/a&gt;, he studied to be an accountant and was practising on a pastoral property in the &lt;a href=\"Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Kimberley&lt;/a&gt; when war broke out in 1914.\nWorld War I.\n28th Battalion.\nPhillipps enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force\"&gt;Australian Imperial Force&lt;/a&gt; in April 1915 and was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"28th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;28th Battalion&lt;/a&gt;, an infantry unit raised the same month at Blackboy Camp, Western Australia. He successfully applied for a commission and left for Egypt aboard HMAT \"Ascanius\" on 9\u00a0June as a &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;. After training in Egypt, he departed with his unit for &lt;a href=\"Gallipoli%20Campaign\"&gt;Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt; aboard the transport \"&lt;a href=\"SS%20Ivernia\"&gt;Ivernia&lt;/a&gt;\" on 4\u00a0September. He was promoted to &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; on 25\u00a0October. The 28th Battalion, which had been sent to Gallipoli late in the campaign as reinforcements, was not heavily engaged on the peninsula, and suffered relatively few casualties before the withdrawal in December 1915.\nIn March 1916, Phillipps was deployed to France with the 28th Battalion for service on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;. He participated in a raid against the forts of &lt;a href=\"Armenti%C3%A8res\"&gt;Armenti\u00e8res&lt;/a&gt; on the night of 6/7\u00a0June, and saw action during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res\"&gt;Battle of Pozi\u00e8res&lt;/a&gt; in July. On 5\u00a0August, he was shot through the thigh, requiring evacuation to England for hospital treatment. He was promoted to &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; on 12\u00a0August. Phillipps rejoined his unit in October but suffered another gunshot wound to the thigh the following month, near &lt;a href=\"Gueudecourt\"&gt;Gueudecourt&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to England once more to recover, and remained in hospital until 2\u00a0March 1917.\nAustralian Flying Corps.\nUnable to take any further part in the war as an infantryman, Phillipps would normally have been repatriated to Australia, but instead engineered a transfer to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Flying%20Corps\"&gt;Australian Flying Corps&lt;/a&gt; (AFC) as &lt;a href=\"adjutant\"&gt;adjutant&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF\"&gt;No.\u00a02 Squadron&lt;/a&gt;. After getting a taste of flying as a passenger, the twenty-five-year-old applied for pilot training, altering his birthdate from 1892 to 1896. The official age limit for pilots in the AFC was thirty, but the preferred age was under twenty-three. Phillipps' application was accepted in May 1917 and, after qualifying for his &lt;a href=\"aircrew%20brevet\"&gt;wings&lt;/a&gt;, his proficiency was considered such that in August he was attached to &lt;a href=\"No.%2032%20Squadron%20RAF\"&gt;No.\u00a032 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Flying%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Flying Corps&lt;/a&gt; to gain operational experience in France. Within three days of arriving he crash-landed his Airco DH.5 after it was hit by &lt;a href=\"anti-aircraft%20warfare\"&gt;anti-aircraft fire&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Ypres\"&gt;Ypres&lt;/a&gt;, but he escaped injury; by the time he completed his attachment in September he was leading combat patrols.\nPhillipps married Ellen Robinson, daughter of Western Australia's &lt;a href=\"Attorney-General%20of%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Attorney-General&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"St%20Mary%20Abbots\"&gt;St Mary Abbots&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kensington\"&gt;Kensington&lt;/a&gt;, London, on 8\u00a0September 1917. Rejoining No.\u00a02 Squadron within the month as a &lt;a href=\"flight%20commander\"&gt;flight commander&lt;/a&gt;, he was initially engaged mainly in low-level strafing and bombing missions in DH.5s as his unit, attached to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;British Third Army&lt;/a&gt;, took part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Passchendaele\"&gt;Battle of Passchendaele&lt;/a&gt;. During the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29\"&gt;Battle of Cambrai&lt;/a&gt;, on 22\u00a0November he recorded his first aerial victory when he turned the tables on a German fighter that had attacked him from above, forcing it to land. He was recommended for the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;Military Cross&lt;/a&gt; on 3\u00a0December, the award being promulgated in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20London%20Gazette\"&gt;The London Gazette&lt;/a&gt;\" on 4\u00a0February 1918, and the full citation appearing on 5\u00a0July:\nNo. 2 Squadron converted to &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5\"&gt;Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5&lt;/a&gt;s in January 1918. The unit generally conducted patrols with flights of six aircraft but found it difficult to lure enemy fighters into combat, so after a lull in fighting early in February it began flying two-plane missions, which yielded better results. The following month, as the &lt;a href=\"German%20spring%20offensive\"&gt;German spring offensive&lt;/a&gt; got under way, Phillipps shot down three German fighters in as many days: a &lt;a href=\"Fokker%20Dr.I\"&gt;Fokker Triplane&lt;/a&gt; on 22\u00a0March, an &lt;a href=\"Albatros%20Flugzeugwerke\"&gt;Albatros&lt;/a&gt; the next morning, and a two-seater on 24\u00a0March; the &lt;a href=\"Official%20History%20of%20Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201914%E2%80%931918\"&gt;official history of Australia in the war&lt;/a&gt; recorded that the last-mentioned enemy lost its wings to Phillipps' machine-gun fire, and \"fell like a stone\". With the Allies holding clear superiority over the German fighters, the main danger to the Australians was from ground fire as most combat took place at low level, and \"their machines came back full of bullet-holes\". On 27\u00a0March, Phillipps achieved two more victories, a Triplane that he sent down in flames near &lt;a href=\"Albert%2C%20Somme\"&gt;Albert&lt;/a&gt; and another German fighter over &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A9aulte\"&gt;M\u00e9aulte&lt;/a&gt;. He was recommended for a &lt;a href=\"Medal%20bar\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt; to his Military Cross on 31\u00a0March, and the award was gazetted on 22\u00a0June:\nDuring April 1918, No.\u00a02 Squadron began operating in wide-ranging offensive \"circus\" patrols made up of large formations of fighters, often drawn from several squadrons. Phillipps destroyed a &lt;a href=\"Pfalz%20Flugzeugwerke\"&gt;Pfalz&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Bapaume\"&gt;Bapaume&lt;/a&gt; on 16\u00a0May, before achieving his greatest success on 12\u00a0June when he shot down four German fighters in a single patrol over &lt;a href=\"Rib%C3%A9court-la-Tour\"&gt;Rib\u00e9court&lt;/a&gt;. His victims included two Fokker Triplanes, one of which he attacked head-on, an &lt;a href=\"LVG\"&gt;LVG&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Fokker%20D.VII\"&gt;Fokker D.VII&lt;/a&gt; flown by Fritz Loerzer, commander of &lt;a href=\"Jagdstaffel%2026\"&gt;\"Jasta\" 26&lt;/a&gt; and an eleven-victory ace, who was captured. The feat also gave Phillipps a total of eleven victories, making him the equal highest-scoring ace in No.\u00a02 Squadron along with Captain &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Garnet%20Forrest\"&gt;Henry Forrest&lt;/a&gt;. Phillipps was recommended for the &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Distinguished Flying Cross&lt;/a&gt; on 16\u00a0June, and the award was promulgated on 3\u00a0August:\nOn 25\u00a0July, Phillipps was leading the escort for a raid on the Lille forts east of Armenti\u00e8res when he spotted a patrol of seven Fokkers. Jettisoning his bombs to lighten his load, he attacked one of the German fighters and shot away its wing; the others retreated. During the Allies' &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Days%20Offensive\"&gt;Hundred Days Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, on 12\u00a0August, he joined fellow No.\u00a02 Squadron ace &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29\"&gt;Adrian Cole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF\"&gt;No.\u00a04 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; aces &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Cobby\"&gt;Harry Cobby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elwyn%20Roy%20King\"&gt;Roy King&lt;/a&gt; to lead their combined forces in support of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;British Fourth Army&lt;/a&gt;, Phillipps accounting for a Fokker that broke up in mid-air. He was credited with two other victories in August to bring his tally to fifteen, making him No.\u00a02 Squadron's second most successful ace after Captain &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Smith%20%28aviator%29\"&gt;Francis Smith&lt;/a&gt;, who finished the war with sixteen. Later that month, Phillipps rotated back to England in accordance with &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; policy, which required pilots to be rested and serve as instructors after nine to twelve months in combat. In October, he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; and posted to command &lt;a href=\"No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF\"&gt;No.\u00a06 (Training) Squadron&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Minchinhampton\"&gt;Minchinhampton&lt;/a&gt;; the unit was primarily responsible for training new pilots for service with No.\u00a02 Squadron.\nInterwar years and World War II.\nPhillipps relinquished command of No.\u00a06 Squadron upon its disbandment in March 1919. He returned to Australia on 16\u00a0June aboard the troopship \"Kaiser-i-Hind\", and was discharged from the Australian Flying Corps on 15\u00a0August. That month he was one of several veteran pilots, including Lieutenant Colonel &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20Watt\"&gt;Oswald Watt&lt;/a&gt; and Major &lt;a href=\"William%20Anderson%20%28RAAF%20officer%29\"&gt;Bill Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, appointed to serve on a committee examining applications for a proposed Australian air service to replace the AFC; the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Air%20Corps\"&gt;Australian Air Corps&lt;/a&gt;, immediate precursor to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Australian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (RAAF), was duly formed on 1\u00a0January 1920 under Anderson's command.\nAfter leaving the military, Phillipps became a &lt;a href=\"Pastoral%20farming\"&gt;grazier&lt;/a&gt; in New South Wales. He purchased Courallie station at Moree in 1926, and was managing the property when &lt;a href=\"Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Australia declared war&lt;/a&gt; in September 1939. In February 1940, he enlisted in the RAAF as a &lt;a href=\"flying%20officer\"&gt;flying officer&lt;/a&gt;. Raised to &lt;a href=\"flight%20lieutenant\"&gt;flight lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, he was posted as assistant chief ground instructor to &lt;a href=\"No.%202%20Elementary%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF\"&gt;No.\u00a02 Elementary Flying Training School&lt;/a&gt; (No.\u00a02 EFTS) at &lt;a href=\"Archerfield%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Archerfield&lt;/a&gt;, Queensland, on 27\u00a0March. No.\u00a02 EFTS was one of twelve basic flying schools established by the RAAF as part of Australia's contribution to the &lt;a href=\"British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan\"&gt;Empire Air Training Scheme&lt;/a&gt;. Phillipps was appointed chief ground instructor on 17\u00a0June. Having been promoted to &lt;a href=\"squadron%20leader\"&gt;squadron leader&lt;/a&gt;, he assumed command of No.\u00a02 EFTS on 20\u00a0October 1940.\nPhillipps died on 21\u00a0May 1941, following an accident in a private plane. The aircraft, piloted by its owner, &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Lieutenant\"&gt;Flight Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; J. W. F. Collins, was reported to have taken off from Archerfield at night without RAAF or &lt;a href=\"Airservices%20Australia\"&gt;Civil Aviation Department&lt;/a&gt; clearance, and collided with trees. Survived by his wife, son and three daughters, Phillipps was cremated at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Thompson%20Crematorium\"&gt;Mount Thompson Crematorium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brisbane\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;. He is commemorated on the Queensland Cremation Memorial, Brisbane, and on panel\u00a0116 of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20War%20Memorial\"&gt;Australian War Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, Canberra."
