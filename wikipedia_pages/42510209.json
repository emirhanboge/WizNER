    "text": "High Halstow National Nature Reserve is on the &lt;a href=\"Hoo%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hoo Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Chatham%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Chatham&lt;/a&gt;. It is also part of the Northwood Hill &lt;a href=\"RSPB\"&gt;Royal Society for the Protection of Birds&lt;/a&gt; Reserve (which is 270 hectares of grazing marsh, woodland and farmland). It was declared a &lt;a href=\"National%20nature%20reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;National Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt; in 1951.\nThe reserve and the woodland lies on the hill to the north of the village of &lt;a href=\"High%20Halstow\"&gt;High Halstow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe woodland, is situated on &lt;a href=\"London%20Clay\"&gt;London Clay&lt;/a&gt;, comprises large &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; trees and &lt;a href=\"Crataegus\"&gt;hawthorn&lt;/a&gt; scrub, with several &lt;a href=\"Acer%20pseudoplatanus\"&gt;sycamore&lt;/a&gt; trees. &lt;a href=\"English%20elm\"&gt;English elm&lt;/a&gt; was formerly abundant but has largely been killed by &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20elm%20disease\"&gt;Dutch elm disease&lt;/a&gt;. The woodland has a diverse flora with over 200 plants recorded, including trees and shrubs.\nIt is also noted for its diversity of butterflies. A number of rare moths have been recorded at the site. The sloe carpet (\"&lt;a href=\"Aleucis%20distinctata\"&gt;Aleucis distinctata&lt;/a&gt;\"), least carpet (\"&lt;a href=\"Idaea%20rusticata\"&gt;Idaea vulpinaria&lt;/a&gt;\") and a colony of the &lt;a href=\"white-letter%20hairstreak\"&gt;white-letter hairstreak&lt;/a&gt; butterfly have been noted on the reserve. Also nine species of &lt;a href=\"dragonfly\"&gt;dragonfly&lt;/a&gt; have also been recorded in the reserve.\nThe reserve is also home to a flock of &lt;a href=\"Common%20nightingale\"&gt;nightingales&lt;/a&gt;. Also the UK's largest and most famous colonies of &lt;a href=\"little%20egret\"&gt;little egret&lt;/a&gt;s, they have been nesting at the site since 2000, reaching approximately 93 pairs by 2007. \nThe reserve may be visited either from (grid ref TR220606) the carpark off Northwood Avenue, to the South-of the woodland. Or from Buckland Farm (the RSPCA Farm and carpark), to west of the woodland. The reserve has a nature trail with attractive sea views and long distance views of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Medway\"&gt;River Medway&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Saxon%20Shore%20Way\"&gt;Saxon Shore Way&lt;/a&gt; long distance path passes through the reserve between &lt;a href=\"Cooling%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Cooling&lt;/a&gt; and High Halstow.\nSmuggling.\nThe wooded hill has been used by &lt;a href=\"smugglers\"&gt;smugglers&lt;/a&gt; in the early 18th century. One documented tale was recorded in 1728. A couple of men from Medway crossed the &lt;a href=\"English%20Channel\"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt; in February 1726. The men smuggled over of tea from &lt;a href=\"Ostend\"&gt;Ostend&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a few yards of &lt;a href=\"Calico%20%28textile%29\"&gt;calico&lt;/a&gt; and a few silk handkerchiefs on a small ship called \"The Sloweley\". Once they landed on the Kent shore, they hid the goods in the woodland on Northward Hill before later moving it to &lt;a href=\"Chalk%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Chalk&lt;/a&gt; church. "
