    "text": "The 2015 Seville City Council election, also the 2015 Seville municipal election, was held on Sunday, 24 May 2015, to elect the 10th &lt;a href=\"City%20Council%20of%20Seville\"&gt;City Council&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Spain\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Seville\"&gt;Seville&lt;/a&gt;. All 31 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with &lt;a href=\"2015%20Spanish%20regional%20elections\"&gt;regional elections&lt;/a&gt; in thirteen &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain\"&gt;autonomous communities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2015%20Spanish%20local%20elections\"&gt;local elections&lt;/a&gt; all throughout &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.\nElectoral system.\nThe &lt;a href=\"City%20Council%20of%20Seville\"&gt;City Council of Seville&lt;/a&gt; () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Spain\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Seville\"&gt;Seville&lt;/a&gt;, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years.\nVoting for the local assembly was on the basis of &lt;a href=\"universal%20suffrage\"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt;, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered and residing in the municipality of Seville and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national &lt;a href=\"Citizenship%20of%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;European citizens&lt;/a&gt; and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the &lt;a href=\"D%27Hondt%20method\"&gt;D'Hondt method&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"closed%20list\"&gt;closed list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;, with an &lt;a href=\"electoral%20threshold\"&gt;electoral threshold&lt;/a&gt; of five percent of valid votes\u2014which included blank ballots\u2014being applied in each local council. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale:\nThe mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the appointee would be determined by lot.\nThe electoral law allowed for &lt;a href=\"Political%20party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Political%20alliance\"&gt;federations&lt;/a&gt; registered in the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;interior ministry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20alliance\"&gt;coalitions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grouping%20of%20electors%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;groupings of electors&lt;/a&gt; to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Seville, as its population was between 300,001 and 1,000,000, at least 5,000 signatures were required.\nOpinion polls.\nThe table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \"Lead\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a poll. When available, seat projections determined by the polling organisations are displayed below (or in place of) the percentages in a smaller font; 16 seats were required for an &lt;a href=\"absolute%20majority\"&gt;absolute majority&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"City%20Council%20of%20Seville\"&gt;City Council of Seville&lt;/a&gt; (17 until 1 January 2015)."
