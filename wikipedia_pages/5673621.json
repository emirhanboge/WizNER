    "text": "Grays Harbor is an &lt;a href=\"estuary\"&gt;estuarine&lt;/a&gt; bay located north of the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20River\"&gt;Columbia River&lt;/a&gt;, on the southwest &lt;a href=\"Pacific\"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt; coast of &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; state, in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=\"ria\"&gt;ria&lt;/a&gt;, which formed at the end of the last ice age, when sea levels flooded the &lt;a href=\"Chehalis%20River%20%28Washington%29\"&gt;Chehalis River&lt;/a&gt;. The bay is long and wide. The &lt;a href=\"Chehalis%20River%20%28Washington%29\"&gt;Chehalis River&lt;/a&gt; flows into its eastern end, where the city of &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt; stands at that river's mouth, on its north bank, with the somewhat smaller city of &lt;a href=\"Hoquiam%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Hoquiam&lt;/a&gt; immediately to its northwest, along the bayshore. Besides the Chehalis, many lesser rivers and streams flow into Grays Harbor, such as &lt;a href=\"Hoquiam%20River\"&gt;Hoquiam River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Humptulips%20River\"&gt;Humptulips River&lt;/a&gt;. A pair of low peninsulas separate it from the Pacific Ocean, except for an opening about two miles (3\u00a0km) in width. The northern peninsula, which is largely covered by the community of &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Shores%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Ocean Shores&lt;/a&gt;, ends in Point Brown. Facing that across the bay-mouth is Point Chehalis, at the end of the southern peninsula upon which stands the town of &lt;a href=\"Westport%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Westport&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrays Harbor is named after Captain &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Gray%20%28sea-captain%29\"&gt;Robert Gray&lt;/a&gt; who discovered and entered it on May 7, 1792 in the course of his fur-trading voyages along the north Pacific coast of North America. Gray named the bay Bullfinch Harbor, but it was afterward named Gray's Harbor by Captain &lt;a href=\"George%20Vancouver\"&gt;George Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, whose contemporaneous explorations of the region\u2014the ships of the two captains had met at sea, only days earlier\u2014were well publicised at the time, while Gray's voyages were not. Gray's Harbor was the name that stuck (the apostrophe was omitted under &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Board%20on%20Geographic%20Names\"&gt;US Board on Geographic Names&lt;/a&gt; guidelines). A few days later, on May 11 Gray found a navigable channel into the &lt;a href=\"estuary%20of%20the%20Columbia%20River\"&gt;estuary of the Columbia River&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Gray%27s%20Columbia%20River%20expedition\"&gt;sailed into it&lt;/a&gt;, the first white man known to have done so.\nSettlement of the area began in the early 1870s and was largely dependent on the &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; industry. As the &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"eastern%20United%20States\"&gt;eastern United States&lt;/a&gt; depleted, many &lt;a href=\"logging\"&gt;loggers&lt;/a&gt; from the East and the &lt;a href=\"Midwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt; migrated to the Grays Harbor area, as well as many &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;ns and &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finns&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Grays%20Harbor%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge\"&gt;Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge&lt;/a&gt; is located on of intertidal mudflats, &lt;a href=\"salt%20marsh\"&gt;salt marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and uplands around Hoquiam.\nThe \"Daily Washingtonian\" was a daily newspaper in Grays Harbor founded by Otis M. Moore.\nIslands and sandbars.\nIslands include:\nProtection Island () is listed by USGS, but is listed by the City of Ocean Shores as an accreted landform called Damon Point, a park attached to Point Brown.\nNamed bars include Whitcomb Flats (), near Westport. A large unnamed bar or island () also stands off of &lt;a href=\"Markham%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Markham&lt;/a&gt; at the mouth of &lt;a href=\"Johns%20River%20%28Washington%29\"&gt;Johns River&lt;/a&gt;.\nSand Island, Goose Island and Whitcomb Flats are included in &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Natural%20Areas%20Program\"&gt;Washington Natural Areas Program&lt;/a&gt;. Johns River Wildlife Area, managed by &lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20Department%20of%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife\"&gt;Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;, includes the Markham island.\nHistoric events.\nIn the early 20th century, Grays Harbor was the largest lumber shipyard in the world. The &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Industrial Workers of the World&lt;/a&gt; led strikes in the area in 1912, 1917, and 1923. Some of these labor actions were militant, such as an armed union ship shooting at the \"Fearless\", a scab ship in 1906.\nThe schooner \"&lt;a href=\"Annie%20Larsen\"&gt;Annie Larsen&lt;/a&gt;\" was seized at Grays Harbor on 25 June 1915 by US customs officials, later leading to what was at the time the most expensive &lt;a href=\"Annie%20Larsen%20affair%23Trial\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; in US legal history.\nDuring World War II, harbor defenses including searchlights, &lt;a href=\"12-inch%20coast%20defense%20mortar\"&gt;12-inch coast defense mortar&lt;/a&gt;, 155\u00a0mm howitzers and other guns were emplaced around Grays Harbor by &lt;a href=\"Western%20Defense%20Command\"&gt;Western Defense Command&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"56th%20Air%20Defense%20Artillery%20Regiment\"&gt;56th Air Defense Artillery Regiment&lt;/a&gt;)."
