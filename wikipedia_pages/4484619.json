In 1879 he became a Member of the &lt;a href=\"Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers\"&gt;Institution of Civil Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, and was then articled to Evans and Sons. For two years he was superintendent of gun machinery for the &lt;a href=\"arsenal\"&gt;arsenal&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Trubia\"&gt;Trubia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. He then spend several years as engineer to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Gas%20Company\"&gt;Imperial Gas Company&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Vauxhall\"&gt;Vauxhall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1852, Thomas emigrated to &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, where he was appointed resident engineer for the &lt;a href=\"dry%20dock\"&gt;dry dock&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Cockatoo%20Island%20Dockyard\"&gt;Cockatoo Island Dockyard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. He held the position until 1857, when he was appointed inspector of &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; railways for New South Wales. Later, he was put in charge of arrangements for the 1868 visit of the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Duke of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;.

In July 1883, the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australian%20Legislative%20Council\"&gt;Western Australian Legislative Council&lt;/a&gt; amended its membership to include the Director of Public Works as an official nominee member.
